00:03
If you would just go ahead and state your name and spell it for me?
00:07
Ok, my first name is Alcena, A-L-C-E-N-A.
00:10
My middle name is Elaine, the traditional spelling.
00:13
My maiden name is Caldwell C-A-L-D-W-E-L-L.
00:16
My last name is Boozer, B-O-O-Z-E-R.
00:20
O.K.
00:21
Thank you.
00:21
Could you tell me when and where you were born?
00:23
I was born in Portland March 19th, 1938.
00:27
Have you lived in Portland your whole life?
00:28
Except when I was in seminary, yes.
00:31
And where did you attend seminary?
00:34
At Church Divinity School of the Pacific which is part of the graduate
00:36
theological union in Berkeley.
00:38
O.K.
00:39
Great.
00:40
How did you find Berkeley?
00:41
Well, I thought I was a liberal and then I found out that I
00:44
was really quite conservative.
00:47
When were you there?
00:48
Down in the—’83 and ’84.
00:51
O.K.
00:56
Were your parents from Portland?
00:57
No, my mother was from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
01:00
My father was from Mason City, Iowa and they met in California.
01:05
What were their occupations?
01:07
My father was a chef-cook and my mother was a housewife.
01:13
So how did they meet in California?
01:15
Well, my mother and her sister—my mother went to California to live with her older
01:23
sister because my mother moved out and married at a young age in Baton Rouge to
01:28
somebody my grandmother couldn’t stand.
01:30
So my mother—my grandmother sent my mother out to California to live with
01:34
her sister, her sister ran a boarding house because they didn’t have hotels
01:37
for people of color in those days.
01:40
The railroad men used to come and stay there on their layovers and
01:43
that’s where she met my father.
01:45
So your father worked for the railroad?
01:46
Yes, he worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad and that’s how they got to
01:49
Oregon—he was transferred up here.
01:53
So what part of Portland did you grow up in?
01:55
Northeast Portland in the area now that is near where—between
02:00
the Rose Quarter and Lloyd Center.
02:04
And you lived there for most of your upbringing?
02:07
I lived there for all of my upbringing and I lived there the year I got married.
02:11
My folks moved out of the house I was raised in because it was going to
02:14
sell the next year to make room for some of that development down there.
02:18
So we got to live there rent free for a year.
02:21
Uh-huh.
02:21
Then, after that, we—my husband and I—moved to Northeast Portland
02:26
in the Walnut Park neighborhood.
02:31
And you stayed there or—
02:32
No, we moved from there down to Irvington and we left Irvington
02:37
when I went to Seminary because in those days they weren’t about
02:39
to help any woman go to seminary.
02:41
The only reason the Bishop let me go was because I believed the Bishop at
02:44
the time because he didn’t think we had the financial resources to go.
02:48
We sold everything we owned so that I could go to seminary.
02:51
Wow.
02:53
So your husband was committed too, huh?
02:55
Oh, he was super committed.
02:56
The first thing he did was go out to sell his Porsche, now
02:58
that’s commitment [laughs]
02:59
. Wow.
03:02
So did you have any siblings?
03:04
Yes, I am the fifth of six.
03:05
There were three girls and three boys and I’m the youngest girl.
03:10
Uh-huh.
03:10
What sort of career paths did your siblings follow?
03:13
My oldest brother followed our father.
03:17
He was a chef.
03:18
Then, my oldest sister was a beautician.
03:22
My oldest brother is the one who is a pharmacist down at Oregon State.
03:26
My next sister was a—she worked mostly for the federal government in clerical roles.
03:34
Then she entered her career as an assistant in—a classroom
03:37
assistant in the school system.
03:39
My brother, Jerry, was a banker.
03:42
And you mentioned that the pharmacist was the first African American—
03:45
Yes.
03:46
—pharmacy student at OSU.
03:48
Mhm.
03:49
What years were they there?
03:50
He was there—it would have been—late 50’s early 60’s.
03:58
Did he ever comment on his experience?
04:00
Oh yes he did.
04:02
One of the things—they went down there the year I graduated from
04:06
high school and his wife went down early because she got a job there on
04:11
campus because she was a secretary.
04:14
He was fearful for a living staying in Corvallis—they had a little
04:17
house they rented near the campus.
04:19
I went down to stay with her while he worked in Portland on a summer job.
04:26
So the atmosphere was not a good one?
04:28
No, it wasn’t conducive.
04:29
He did fine in the program and everything, but the atmosphere was just very
04:33
different in Corvallis in those days.
04:34
In the town?
04:35
Yes.
04:38
So where did you go to school when you were in Portland?
04:41
I went to Holladay Grade School which is long since closed.
04:46
It’s where Lloyd Center sits.
04:47
Then I went to Washington High School, also long since closed, which was
04:51
in Southeast Portland even though we lived closer to Grant but in those
04:55
days, they kind of gerrymandered the district boundary lines.
04:58
I went to Portland State University for most of my undergraduate work.
05:02
What did you study?
05:03
Education.
05:04
I mean, in those days you didn’t have too many choices.
05:07
You were either going to be a social worker or a school teacher.
05:10
So I chose to teach school.
05:13
I think my father chose it for me.
05:15
So you said for most of your education it was at—
05:18
Portland State and then the year I got married—during my senior year—and
05:22
I became very ill for a few years.
05:25
So I was home and then
05:29
I had my children.
05:29
Part of the illness was trying to have children.
05:32
We had two boys and then when they got to be school age, there was a federal
05:37
program—it’s called B2—where they actually paid you to go become an intern
05:43
because I was within twelve hours or fifteen hours of completing my degree.
05:48
They hired me for that program and I was assigned as an intern at Grant High
05:52
School and then Grant hired me that year.
05:56
They said “Don’t sign any other contracts.
05:57
We will hire you to teach social studies at Grant High School.”
06:00
And how long were you at Grant?
06:01
I was at Grant for 14 years.
06:03
I became a counselor there and then—well I did grad school at night
06:09
at Portland State to finish my masters and then get a counseling certificate.
06:15
I also started working on an administrative certificate and then I
06:18
was appointed the Vice Principal there.
06:21
I left Grant to go to Seminary.
06:23
O.K.
06:24
And so that was 1983 you said?
06:26
Yes, yes.
06:29
So you were at—O.K.
06:30
What was your husband’s occupation?
06:31
My husband was a personnel administrator.
06:34
He was a—well he started out originally he was a history major
06:38
at the University of Portland.
06:39
That’s where he graduated.
06:41
Then he worked for the Juvenile Court—as a counselor at the Juvenile Court.
06:46
Then he went to work for Job Corps.
06:50
Then he became a personnel administrator, first with a telephone company and
06:55
then with Portland General Electric.
06:58
He left that job to go down to CDSP where he did everything including
07:03
becoming a substitute teacher in San Ramon County Schools.
07:07
And
07:09
then he
07:13
went to Portland Community College when we came back.
07:16
At the time that he died, he was the manager—personnel manager they now call
07:20
it Vice-President of Human Resources.
07:24
That’s what he did at the time of his death.
07:27
And what year was that?
07:28
That was 1990.
07:31
And you had children.
07:32
Yes, we have two sons.
07:34
My oldest son, Bentley, had his fiftieth birthday last Sunday.
07:38
He is autistic, but he does have a part time job and he still lives at home.
07:44
The other son, Clark, he’s a graduate of Oregon State also.
07:49
He worked in the schools for a while as a counselor for at-risk kids and
07:54
then he became ill for a few years and no longer could he work for the school
07:58
system, but now he works for Trimet.
08:01
He’s an operator.
08:02
So the whole family stayed in Portland?
08:04
Yes.
08:07
So, were you involved in the Church your whole life?
08:11
Yes, yes.
08:13
Even the times when I was having a war with God, I was involved with the Church.
08:20
See, our two boys—basically Bentley was autistic which took awhile to
08:24
diagnose and our younger son had congenital glaucoma and when they did
08:29
the surgery, when he was six months old, we almost lost him to this rare thing
08:34
that is called Malignant Hypothermia where people undergo the anesthesia
08:38
and it gives them a very high fever that can almost take you out of here.
08:41
They didn’t know a lot about it in those days.
08:43
They really just went back through his records and diagnosed
08:47
that when he had polymyositis.
08:49
They were trying to diagnose that and the anesthesiologist got all
08:52
excited and he said, “He was here as a child, we’ve got his records
08:55
and now we know what happened to
08:58
him.”
08:58
Were your parents involved in the Church as well?
09:01
Yes.
09:02
My mother was involved in the Church and my Dad—even though he ran on the
09:06
railroads, so he wasn’t very here—but one of the things—his children—we all
09:11
wanted when he died was his prayer book because even though he couldn’t
09:16
attend church every Sunday, he was a devout Anglican and he read that
09:19
Book of Common Prayer every day.
09:22
Because he worked on the railroad the pages are all messy and everything,
09:25
so we have a little ceremony where the oldest male in the family
09:30
always gets that prayer book.
09:34
So what church were you raised in then?
09:36
Right here!
09:37
O.K.
09:37
This one, wow.
09:38
This one, yeah.
09:40
I remember the old building was here when I was six years old.
09:43
They sort of demolished that and this Parish hall was the first
09:46
part built and we worshipped here.
09:48
Then they put up a sanctuary.
09:52
So the seminary was clearly a big leap for you and your family.
09:55
What sort of lead to that?
09:56
I mean, how did this come about?
09:58
Well, it came about—as I said, I was having a war with God because Father
10:02
Stone—bless his heart—when I was sitting there with the one child who was in
10:09
jeopardy of his life that had the malignant hypothermia after the surgery
10:14
and then the same week they told us about Bentley, finally diagnosed him as being
10:17
autistic, Father Stone said, “Alcena, God wouldn’t give you any more than you
10:21
could stand.” I just looked at him, and I said, “Father Stone, if God wonders what
10:25
I can stand, we’re just about there and a loving God wouldn’t do this to me.” So
10:29
I didn’t go to Church for a long time.
10:30
My husband would dress the kids and take them to Church and I just decided
10:34
I wasn’t doing this thing anymore.
10:36
Then gradually I’ve gotten back because one of the things that hit me one day
10:40
was I was a very shy, timid woman, but after having these kids and having to
10:45
start a fight for their services—because my husband worked two jobs so we could
10:49
pay for the medical care—one day it struck me, you’re not the same person
10:54
you were before you had these kids.
10:55
There’s some good that comes out of everything.
10:59
So then I started back—coming back to Church and working most of the time.
11:05
I did clerical stuff here.
11:06
Then we had a priest here, one of about two priests after Father Stone, and a
11:12
lot of the people who were a part of that founding generation were becoming
11:15
old and could no longer get here to receive the sacraments of the Church.
11:20
I was really on the case of this priest saying, “Father,
11:22
you need to get out there.
11:23
Those people need the sacrament.” He said, “Well I
11:27
don’t have a deacon.” And I said, “What do you mean you don’t have
11:28
a deacon?” “I need a deacon.
11:29
Deacons do that.” And I said, “Well what do you have to do to be the deacon?
11:31
I’ll be the deacon—” never realizing what I was saying.
11:36
So I thought about that a little more and when I told my husband, James,
11:40
about it—who had a tremendous sense of humor—he just said, “All I have
11:42
to tell you is this has got to be the greatest conversion since St.
11:45
Paul” [laughs]
11:49
. We had a local Diocesan School of Theology and I did that and I did some of
11:54
the—took classes at some of the different theological schools around this area.
11:59
Then I took the exam—because that’s how they trained deacons
12:02
at that time—and became a deacon, thinking that was my call.
12:07
At the time I was ordained a deacon, my husband told me that “you know, you’ve
12:12
been called to be a priest” and this was in the ‘70s, you know, women—“No,
12:17
no, didn’t call me to be a priest.
12:18
Besides, God would tell me first, not you, if I was called to be a priest.”
12:23
When he did that and then we said—I said that they’re not gonna ordain a—for men
12:28
at that time, they would actually ordain men if they continued local training.
12:33
Women—they would tell you, you have to go to seminary.
12:35
It was really a not too subtle strategy of keeping you out.
12:39
So he went out to see the Bishop with me and he said “she’s going.
12:45
That’s what she has to do.
12:46
She’s going.” That’s when he went out and sold that Porsche.
12:49
Uh-huh.
12:51
So we went down there and it was—it was a good time.
12:54
I mean one day we were in a nice house in Irvington and then we were in this
12:58
little dinky apartment down in Berkeley.
13:02
Were there any other women in that circumstance in the
13:05
Portland area at the time?
13:06
There were very few.
13:07
There were women in some of the other, you know, some of the other denominations.
13:11
There were very few because I think in Oregon—in the Dioceses of Oregon, I think
13:16
I was the third woman who was ordained.
13:18
There were very few of us for a while.
13:21
As for African American women in the Episcopal Church, at that
13:25
time there were only three of us nationally who had been ordained.
13:27
Wow.
13:28
Now they’re just—now half the people in seminary are women and almost
13:31
half the priests in the Church are very shortly going to be females.
13:35
Uh-huh.
13:38
Who are some people who have been influential in your life?
13:41
Well some of the people that I mentioned here—needless-to-say Father Stone,
13:45
a very strong influence on my life.
13:47
Carl’s wife, Judge Mercedes Deiz because she always encouraged people.
13:52
My own parents.
13:54
My husband was a great influence on my life because he always just was “keep
13:59
pushing,” that “you know, you could do a lot of stuff” and always very supportive.
14:06
My oldest sister who is now deceased, Dolores LaGrone, who
14:09
was a member of this Parish too.
14:12
And then in terms of people I didn’t meet but considered an influence on my life
14:17
would be Mary McLeod Bethune and W.E.B.
14:22
Dubois because I used to read him a lot and he was also an Episcopalian.
14:33
How about in terms of the social side of your life.
14:37
What’s been important there?
14:39
Has it been revolving mostly around the Church, or was there another sort
14:43
of component of what you did for fun with your friends, that kind of thing.
14:47
Well, I was active as an educator and in those circles, a lot
14:51
of things—I was an avid hiker.
14:56
Now my knees are recovering, but I did have an awful lot of fun
14:59
blowing them out over the years.
15:01
I went down—I did the White Mountain in New Hampshire and I did the Canadian
15:06
Rockies and up in Alaska, in Denali park, not Denali, but in the park hiking.
15:12
I went down to Peru and did the trek from Cusco to Machu Picchu.
15:18
I loved to do that.
15:19
At age 64, I completed the Portland marathon, which I
15:23
consider one of the highlights of my life just to have finished.
15:26
Sure, yeah.
15:29
Then I’m an activist of sorts too.
15:31
I’ve been out in the street demonstrating for a lot of stuff over the years.
15:36
Yeah, tell me a little more about that.
15:38
Well, in the early years, when they had things dealing with desegregation.
15:44
Recently, I’ve also been involved with the Worker’s Rights Board because the
15:49
people working in the hospitals—the cleaning staff, the food service staff—are
15:55
really treated abysmally by some of the hospitals, lead organizations.
16:00
So Worker’s Rights and a lot of clergy have been involved with that.
16:04
We have demonstrated outside in front of the hospitals and things.
16:07
It sort of startles them some times to see all the clergy in their collars out there.
16:13
But we were—Providence I spent a lot of time outside there because
16:18
that one still isn’t really settled.
16:21
We were out in front of Legacy there because at that time, I was on my cane
16:25
and I just sort of—and the administrators were looking out the window and I
16:28
shook my cane at them and said “shame
16:34
on you!” [laughs]
16:34
Then I worked with the Albina Ministerial Alliance.
16:38
There’s a coalition for justice in police reform and we’ve been really
16:42
involved with that for the past two or three years since the Campbell’s
16:45
shooting and some of the other shootings.
16:50
Any other hobbies?
16:52
Hobbies?
16:53
I loved to garden and we did some—and one time before the parking lot went in
16:59
here, we had a community garden out here.
17:04
I was involved here when we started the program of feeding the poor.
17:08
At first they thought I was out of my mind, you know, when I came here and
17:11
said “we can do this every Saturday.” When I got here, they were doing it
17:15
once a month, or once every other month.
17:16
I sort of said, “We really could do this every Saturday.” So people
17:21
started jumping in and helping.
17:23
I discovered a long time ago, folks will do a lot more with you than for you.
17:29
O.K.
17:30
so are there any other important themes or events in your life that you
17:33
want us to know about as we start to prepare for more in depth conversation?
17:38
Oh, probably just the evolution about what is happening in terms of churches
17:44
and involvement in the public sphere because in terms of politics, you
17:51
know, there is a separation between church and state, but yet most clergy
17:56
will tell you if they’re thinking at all that budgets are moral documents.
18:02
So we have to get involved and a lot of my preaching revolves
18:06
around social justice issues.
18:08
I believe in the prophetic office of the Church.
18:13
Well you mentioned Dubois and Bethune.
18:16
Are there any other folks who have influenced you sort of philosophically?
18:21
I think in terms of theologically and philosophically, Julian of Norwich
18:27
who was a 14th century mystic.
18:32
Gosh, there’s so many.
18:35
John Howard Yoder was a theologian who writes and is still, I believe, teaching.
18:41
And
18:44
Hauerwas, yes, Emily Hauerwas.
18:49
Some of those writings have influenced me, and then Howard Thurman who was a
18:55
mystic and a theologian and teacher.
18:59
Yeah, those folks are the—and then, I love reading Elaine Pagels who’s—who
19:08
gets into the public sphere you know with some of her writings.
19:13
O.K.
19:16
well that’s what I’ve have to ask you.
19:17
O.K.
19:17
Thank you very
