00:08
My name is Alcena Boozer and today’s date is May the thirtieth 2012.
00:16
I’m interested in knowing a little bit about your childhood.
00:19
If you could describe maybe the neighborhood you grew up in and
00:22
some memories from your early life.
00:25
O.K. Well I grew up about a half mile south of here, down between
00:33
the Rose Garden and Lloyd Center.
00:36
It was a multiethnic neighborhood.
00:39
There were many people from Yugoslavia, Filipinos, Japanese after
00:46
the war was over and they came back from the relocation centers and a
00:51
sprinkling of African Americans.
00:54
Carl’s memory was that in his neighborhood, people
00:57
got along pretty well.
00:57
Was that your memory as well?
00:58
Yeah, they got along very well.
01:00
It was just a question of neighborhood and all the kids, I mean, any adult was likely
01:04
to correct you if you were misbehaving.
01:06
The
01:08
neighborhood store was a gathering place.
01:12
Then we were about five—six blocks away from Williams Avenue which was sort
01:19
of the main street that ran through what little Portland had of an African
01:22
American community at that time.
01:26
What were some of the pillars of that community?
01:28
The places that people would gather?
01:29
They would gather in the Churches.
01:31
This Church was a center because in ’46, this building was completed, so
01:36
it was one of the newer facilities.
01:38
They would also gather at Bethel AME which at that time as on North Larrabee
01:42
Street down by the Willamette river and at Mount Olivet which is still
01:48
on first avenue and Weidler Streets.
01:55
The adults would gather—there’s a fraternal hall right off of William’s
01:58
avenue in William’s court, a little place that [went off before?] And
02:02
there were a couple of grocery stores.
02:03
There were two in our immediate neighborhood and then there was a
02:09
Japanese store and given the times, it was called “Mama Japs.” It
02:15
was up there on the corner of Weidler and Williams Avenue.
02:19
And in the schools, there was Holladay Grade School there which
02:25
is in between near the western edge of what is now Lloyd center.
02:31
Did I hear correctly that your family used to host Black entertainers
02:34
that would come into town?
02:35
Yes, yes, they did.
02:36
Can you talk a little bit about that?
02:37
Well, in those days, Black entertainers could not stay in the hotels downtown
02:43
and my Aunt, who lived in Oakland California, had a boarding house.
02:48
So she used to have people stay at her boarding house and she’d tell
02:52
them “when you get to Portland, you can stay at my sister’s house.”
02:57
Some of the people I remember were Louis Jordan and Lionel Hampton and, oh gosh,
03:04
those are the names that come immediately to memory, but there were a lot of them.
03:08
It must have been pretty exciting.
03:09
It was pretty exciting because many times, that’s how I got
03:11
to see a lot of those people.
03:13
They always gave my family some tickets and so we were taken to see a lot of them.
03:17
Wow.
03:18
Did they ever put any impromptu performances in your house?
03:21
Well, Lionel Hampton did.
03:23
Yeah.
03:25
On his vibraphones?
03:26
No, with a piano.
03:28
Yeah.
03:29
Wow.
03:32
So, talk a little bit about going to school.
03:35
Well, I started at Holladay grade School and that was in the war.
03:40
There were too many kids here because of all the people who moved
03:42
in to work in the war industries.
03:45
There was no kindergarten, so I started the first grade.
03:49
I went there for the first two grades.
03:52
Then, they shut down Holladay as a grade school and had a girl’s vocational
03:59
school there called Jane Adams.
04:01
So they sent us to Irvington for one year.
04:04
Irvington was a remarkable experience because we were literally integrating
04:08
that sort of and that was not a happy memory because of the way we were treated.
04:14
It
04:17
was kind of hard.
04:17
Some kids would say “you can’t drink out of that water fountain.” Then they could
04:21
just drink out of it or something like that. I don’t remember the adults at
04:25
that school doing a whole lot about it.
04:27
Uh-huh.
04:28
So it was sort of the kids mistreating one another and
04:31
the adults turning a blind eye.
04:31
Right, yes, yes.
04:34
But they reopened Holladay the next year and I only spent
04:37
the third grade year there.
04:38
They reopened Holladay in the fourth grade.
04:40
And then that was a good mixture of kids from the neighborhood and
04:44
that was a very happy experience.
04:45
We did a lot of things.
04:48
We had one gentleman, Robert Ford, who was the first African American teacher
04:53
hired in the Portland School District.
04:56
He was sort of a legend in his own time, an eighth grade teacher
04:59
and very demanding of people.
05:03
All the teachers were fairly demanding.
05:05
They hadn’t heard yet that we weren’t supposed to be able to do anything.
05:09
So was he a mentor for you?
05:11
He was sort of a mentor because I think the best thing he ever did
05:15
for me, I think at one time I was the captain of Safe Patrol—the fire
05:20
patrol and I worked in the office and I was the student body president.
05:23
One day he said “Miss Caldwell, you are nothing from this point on. You are
05:28
going to stay in this classroom and do your work.” So he was great in that way.
05:33
He always encouraged us.
05:35
I used to see him over the years and I did bury him because that
05:40
was one of the things he left, that he wanted me to do his funeral.
05:45
So you were very active in school.
05:47
Yes I was.
05:47
I was active
05:50
in elementary school.
05:51
I was not that active in grade school, I mean high school.
05:55
Why?
05:55
Well high school was very different.
05:57
That was Washington high school and there were probably like maybe
06:01
twenty African American students in the school at that time.
06:07
People, I mean, still teachers were demanding and everything, but the social
06:12
kind of avenues weren’t going to be there.
06:16
I think that was for some kids, was a matter of choice.
06:18
My sister, who is three years older, she joined some of the clubs, but I didn’t.
06:24
Did you feel excluded?
06:26
Yes I did feel excluded so I put my energy in to studying.
06:31
Uh-huh.
06:32
Was it sort of openly hostile, or was it more…?
06:35
It was subtle.
06:37
Every once in a while there would be a rather egregious kind of faux pas there,
06:42
once the choir sang “Some folks say that the darky don’t steal/but I caught one
06:48
in my cornfield,” all the Black heads we walked out. And the principle chided
06:52
us about why we should understand those things. And I thought it was interesting
06:59
that he couldn’t understand that.
07:01
Yeah.
07:03
Well, you went to school during World War II.
07:04
Do you have memories about what the environment was like during that time?
07:09
Well, for the first two grades, because the war ended in ’45 at
07:14
the end of my first grade year.
07:17
But I do remember the first grade, that by bringing your money to
07:21
school to buy the war stamps and that actually I guess it was safe enough
07:26
because holiday was about six or seven blocks from where the old sears was.
07:32
And about four of us kids walked down by ourselves to go down to sears to take
07:38
everybody’s money and go buy the war stamps and bring them back to school.
07:42
Nowadays that would be… that would cause great problems.
07:47
Uh-huh.
07:47
In our last interview… well, I’ll get back to that in a second.
07:52
I think more chronologically speaking, we were more interested in knowing if
07:56
you had memories of the Vanport Flood?
07:57
Yes I do.
07:59
We were playing outside.
08:00
It was Memorial Day in 1948, and it was a very hot day.
08:06
We used to always play softball in the street and all of a sudden we saw all of
08:11
these people coming in on trucks, on the backs of trucks, and everything, then my
08:15
mother came out and told us it was on the radio, that the Vanport had flooded, and
08:20
then the school was shut down for about a week because they had to house people
08:24
in the schools around and everything.
08:27
I could remember after about 8-9 days somebody taking us out
08:31
in the car out to Denver Ave. and we literally saw the flood.
08:35
You could see… The road was up there and you could see those houses that
08:38
which were poorly constructed, bouncing up against the dikes and everything.
08:45
So they were housing people in the schools?
08:47
Yes they did.
08:48
It worked temporary until they found… Some people, I imagine, went back to wherever
08:53
they had lived before they came here to work, as I think that many of them felt
08:56
that it was a temporary thing to do, go and help the war effort, ear some money,
09:00
then go back to where they came from.
09:02
But an awful lot of people did wind up staying too.
09:06
So what was the conversation like in the community about this?
09:11
Well it was typically of thing like that they were rumors.
09:14
One of the rumors was there were bodies stacked up like cordwood in some armory
09:19
somewhere, which wasn’t in fact true.
09:22
And there are many stories of people… Cause one family that happened while
09:27
they were worshipping here said they were eating Sunday dinner and they got
09:30
a suitcase, put the Sunday dinner in the suitcase, and got in the car and left.
09:38
So the last time that we talked to you, you said that when you were thinking about
09:43
your career options that were essentially available to you were you could be
09:47
a social worker or a school teacher.
09:48
That’s correct.
09:49
Is this something that was discussed within the community or within the family?
09:54
Within the family.
09:55
I mean, for most people that was a given.
09:57
You knew that if you majored in accounting you wouldn’t get a job as an accountant
10:01
downtown or something like that.
10:04
A few people did go on to work for Bonneville Power Administration.
10:08
Like Carl?
10:09
Yeah.
10:09
Like Carl.
10:11
And some other people, but for the most part, yeah that’s it.
10:15
Most people decided to work in schools or as social workers who
10:17
went on to secondary education.
10:20
My oldest brother, who is five years older than I am, he became a pharmacist.
10:26
I think I told you, he was the first person to go to the school of
10:29
pharmacy who was a native Oregonian.
10:33
And he came back to Portland to work?
10:34
No, he worked in Eugene first, but he eventually made his
10:38
way back to Portland to work.
10:40
So he
10:44
was able to find avenues of employment then?
10:45
Cause it sounds like then-
10:46
Yes, he was-
10:47
-you were talking about how accountants couldn’t find a job-
10:49
Right.
10:50
But he was.
10:51
By this time it was a little lighter, you see.
10:53
Yeah.
10:53
So those few years made a big difference.
10:55
Made a huge difference.
10:56
By that time we were starting to have fair employment practices, you know, I
11:00
think it was the Truman administration that put in the Fair Employment Act.
11:03
How
11:08
did you meet your husband?
11:09
Well, I had always known my husband because they were another family here,
11:14
and he was six years older than me, and he was an altar boy and everything, and
11:22
he was a good friend of my older brother, the one who went to pharmacy school.
11:26
They all went to service about the same time, and got home about the same time.
11:31
And I was actually dating somebody else who was up at Fort Lewis, and
11:36
it was getting ready to go to the sorority ball and my date’s leave was
11:43
canceled and my brother said, ‘Get Jim to take you because he’s just like a
11:47
brother to you.’ So, Jim did in fact take me and the first thing he said
11:51
is, ‘This will cost you another date.’
11:56
What was your wedding like?
11:57
The wedding was here and it was
12:03
a standard kind of wedding with the bridesmaids and
12:06
the groomsmen and everybody.
12:07
It was really a family affair because I had two sisters and a niece
12:12
who’s a little bit younger than I am, and they were my bridesmaids.
12:16
My brothers and Jim’s brothers were the groomsmen
12:20
and the reception was also in the parish hall here.
12:23
You mentioned everybody sort of knowing each other.
12:26
Did you know Carl and his brother?
12:26
Yeah,
12:30
I always can remember Carl and his brother because one of the things as a tiny child
12:35
during the war you remembered, in the old church before this one structure was
12:38
built, was seeing them when they came home in those dress uniforms, you know.
12:43
It was quite a sight.
12:48
We talked a little bit with Carl about the Civil Rights movement.
12:52
I’m interested in knowing what your involvement was in the ‘50s and ‘60s.
12:58
Well, in the ‘50s I was still in school then and it was mostly reading about
13:06
it, keeping track of what was going on through the news and everything.
13:09
By the ‘60s, I got married in 1960, and by that time by
13:14
walking in some of the public demonstrations here because there
13:17
were many of them in sympathy with the freedom riders going downtown
13:21
and things, and, so, I did that.
13:25
But the Civil Rights movement in Oregon is an ongoing process,
13:29
I’m not sure it will ever end.
13:31
Because I am still involved in it in terms of what we have to do in
13:35
town to see that things go fairly.
13:39
What were those early marches like?
13:41
Actually everybody from the community, almost, would get in, and the other
13:44
thing about it was the early marches, you had a wide variety of the community
13:48
because Portland, you know, was a fairly liberal town, it was then too so lots
13:53
of folks would support that effort.
13:57
So, it was pretty well received?
13:58
It was well received and Mark had [real icon?] and hero in this area because he
14:05
led the movement to finally get that, part of the state constitution had said
14:10
remove it said that Blacks couldn’t own property in Portland and Oregon rather.
14:15
What do you remember about some of the main figureheads of the
14:19
Civil Rights movement of that time?
14:20
Ok, I remember E. Shelton Hill, who worked for the Urban League,
14:25
Bill Barry who was a gentleman who came here at the Urban League.
14:28
I remember that Father Stone and Doctor Unthank, who was a parishioner here and
14:33
a senior warden were very instrumental in organizing both the Urban League
14:38
and NAACP chapters here in Portland.
14:41
And many a folk who belonged to the parish also were active in the movement.
14:47
Myrtle Carr, whose name might have come up, she was very active.
14:52
Mercedes Deiz, Carl’s wife, when she got here she was active.
14:57
Some people weren’t active in the parish but well known in the neighborhood.
15:01
Verdell and Otto Rutherford, they had been literally born and raised
15:06
here and so they were very active.
15:10
How about some of the national level figures, like Dr. King or Malcolm X.
15:14
Dr. King, I don’t remember Malcolm coming here, but Dr. King
15:17
did come here, at least once.
15:19
Jesse Jackson came here several times, and whenever they came, of
15:24
course, you had a large turnout for those kinds of things, those events.
15:29
And people would keep track of Dr. King following him, you know, in the newspapers
15:34
and on television and everything.
15:37
It was a remarkable thing to watch, and even via television, him speak.
15:44
What did you think of the Black Muslims and Malcolm X at the time?
15:48
Well, you know, at first I wondered about the Black Muslims because to me, when
15:55
they started out before Malcolm really got active, it was Elijah Mohammed who
16:00
was a little man, and I didn’t see that as a legitimate Islamic religion, so I
16:06
thought that was just somebody who had decided to have a way to gain a following.
16:11
And then once Malcolm got active and the big split, Malcolm really did go
16:16
to Mecca and become, he did enough research to say this really isn’t Islam.
16:23
Then I saw them primarily as people who really helped in the community because
16:27
what you saw of the Muslims here, people that you had known as drug dealers
16:32
or whatever were cleaned up suddenly being very positive in the community.
16:38
There was a Black Panther chapter here too…
16:40
Yeah, I know
16:44
the panther, the gentleman who stills works over in the community center
16:47
was one of the [heads?] for it here.
16:51
I had talked to him since and he said the one mistake they probably made, in the
16:56
Panther Organization, was the advocating of [?]. They recognized that later.
17:03
The positive things the Panther movement did here, they did start that breakfast
17:06
program and they fed kids before they put those programs in the schools here,
17:12
and they did put pressure on some of the grocery stores who were sort of ripping
17:17
off the community and higher prices and inferior kind of products to change.
17:23
Some of them wound up leaving the community, but the
17:26
ones who stayed did better.
17:30
How did the atmosphere change as Vietnam became more of a prevalent
17:35
issues within, I guess the community of activists here in Portland?
17:41
The community of activists here saw it as, number one, as providing cannon fodder.
17:45
They said if you look at who’s there on the frontlines, the people
17:50
were getting shot, injured and killed are primarily folk of color.
17:55
They’d say, it doesn’t make sense to go do that to attack another group of
18:00
people of color when you don’t even have the rights here in your own country.
18:06
So did sort of the tactics change in terms of what people were doing?
18:09
I mean did it go from marches to, were there, like you see footage
18:15
of people burning their draft cards, was that happening here too?
18:18
That was happening here and it sort of depended.
18:20
You see there were different segments of the community here.
18:23
Some of the more traditional, Civil Rights, didn’t quite go for
18:27
that radically kind of movement.
18:30
Younger people, you frequently see that as the movements go over
18:33
the years, younger people were willing to be more confrontational.
18:37
You know, do what was…by whatever means necessary.
18:42
And where were you fitting on that spectrum?
18:44
Well, that time I was teaching history at Grant High School and senior social
18:51
studies and so I would try to keep an open mind and let the kids investigate
18:57
all avenues of it to try to teach critical thinking skills, which was a
19:01
lot of fun with youngsters of that age.
19:06
And when they were trying to, one of the things, the voting age was still
19:11
twenty-one, but for model cities programs you could vote at eighteen.
19:16
So, to teach them about civic engagement we found one of our
19:21
eighteen year olds, a senior, and ran him for the model city’s board.
19:24
So, they had great fun and having a campaign and going out they
19:28
didn’t win, but they learned a lot through the campaign.
19:32
It must have been difficult sort of being a mentor of kids that age as they are
19:36
graduating from high school and possibly facing the prospect of going off to work.
19:40
Yes, it was, and you know we
19:44
did try to encourage kids to think critically about whether or not you
19:48
wanted to do this, if you didn’t want to do this what were your options.
19:52
I mean, does it really make sense to just run off to Canada, or
19:54
can you become a conscientious objector or something like that.
19:58
During that time I also served on the last draft board.
20:02
Oh, really?
20:02
Yeah, and I thought that was good because I thought I saw myself as somebody who
20:06
would listen if somebody was a legitimate, conscientious objector or just somebody
20:11
who was wanting to get out of something.
20:14
And do you feel like you were able to perform that duty pretty well?
20:17
I think so, but we really weren’t there for that long before
20:20
they ended the active draft.
20:26
Tell me a little about ‘Project Return.’
20:28
Project Return.
20:29
When I, I have to sort of explain, I was there in the high school, I
20:37
was a counselor when I left, and then I decided that I was going
20:42
to pursue the active ministry.
20:45
I had already been ordained a deacon by being locally trained,
20:49
and then I needed to go down to see the [?] so I took a leave for a
20:53
number, a couple years to go do that.
20:55
And when I came back, I first worked for Oregon Episcopal School
21:00
as a Dean of the upper school and the Chaplain to the upper school.
21:05
Then I decided that, that wasn’t really my calling because those kids were
21:10
quite well off and that was a fabulous school, but I felt my calling was down
21:15
here in the center city and, so, I decided to go back to the public schools.
21:20
They didn’t know what to do with me.
21:22
One of the administrators pointed out, ‘You’ve got a high profile as a priest,
21:27
can we have a priest in the schools, an active priest?’ And my response was,
21:31
‘Well, it’s not like I’m going to go down the halls sprinkling holy water.’
21:34
So, they decided well, we don’t if we can send her back in a building as a VP,
21:41
that was my rank when I left, so, ah!
21:43
We know what to do.
21:43
We’ve got these kids that are not in school.
21:47
We had 55,000 kids in Portland at that time.
21:50
Ms. Boozer, you are now the attendance supervisor.
21:53
Me, for 55,000 kids and whatever percentage of them
21:56
who weren’t going to school.
21:58
And everybody just sort of, my colleagues said, you know they don’t
22:01
expect you to do anything, just sit there in the office for a while, then
22:03
they’ll send you back in a building.
22:06
You know, my father had a work ethic, that just wasn’t in my
22:09
DNA to sort of just sit there.
22:11
So I decided, let me go out and see how many of these kids I can find.
22:15
Well, that got to be a challenge and I found lots of them.
22:18
And after about three or four months, we were at a school board
22:22
meeting and they had me report on it, and then one of the school board
22:27
members said, ‘This is your chance.
22:29
Ask for what you want, you got them right here publically.’ So, they
22:33
allowed me, they gave me the funding to hire another attendance counselor.
22:40
So, I hired, at that time I was in my early to mid-forties, so
22:45
I hired a guy who was half my age and could run twice as fast.
22:49
So, the two of us, we actually rounded up five hundred kids that year.
22:53
So that caught the public’s imagination and we got funding, and I went back to
22:58
the school board and we got funding for, what we call, transitional classrooms
23:03
because one of the things we discovered was that the kids were out for a reason.
23:07
Most of them weren’t just out cutting to have a good time, they were
23:10
cutting because there was no food at home, there was no transportation,
23:14
parents might be off doing something else, they were responsible for
23:17
young kids, no food in the house.
23:19
So there were all these social issues going, only finding a whole bunch
23:23
of social agencies in their lives and nobody’s coordinating this.
23:26
So, we set up a transitional classroom as a place for them to come get reacquainted
23:32
with school, sort of, do the evaluation where they were academically and begin
23:38
to do some prescriptive work there.
23:40
And then we had people from the social agencies who could come into
23:45
the Project Return classroom and work with us, and we sort of acted as the
23:49
brokers for the various programs.
23:52
So, it was very successful until funding ran out, and it was about
23:58
probably in the third or fourth year of doing that when they sent
24:01
me to Jefferson as the principal.
24:07
Was food part of that?
24:08
I mean was that part of what you were trying to do was to help feed these kids?
24:09
Yeah, we tried, we did feed them.
24:11
We found ways to feed them, we found other groups to feed them.
24:17
People are remarkable in terms of if they know what the issue is, people
24:20
will help you and they’ll do anything much more with you than for you.
24:25
So, some of the clergy from the Albina Ministerial Alliance, they
24:29
came in and said, well what can we do?
24:32
And I shared with them all of the issues and I said, most of these
24:35
kids don’t come from stable families.
24:37
One of those churches, and I’ve always been impressed by them, they decided
24:41
that they would become foster parents.
24:44
And they went through whatever they had to do and they started become foster
24:47
parents to stabilize an awful lot of kids, and that was Emmanuel Temple, a
24:51
Pentecostal church, Bishop A. A. Wells.
24:54
And that church also purchased, before they built their current building,
25:00
they bought a lot of property and they had a bunch of houses.
25:04
They started half-way houses, they ran drug recovery programs,
25:09
they ran employment programs.
25:11
You know, so they just did…its remarkable what organizations can do if somebody
25:19
is willing to be with them, and they had actual leaders who would rise out
25:24
of all these institutions—the local neighborhood institutions—and see
25:28
what can we do and we do it together.
25:32
What got you started down the road to becoming an activist?
25:36
You know I think, basically, it was growing up in a home where my mother
25:41
was sort of the unofficial solver of all problems, arbitrator of all
25:47
disputes, and if something happened, and sort of seeing that go on, and
25:51
my dad was on the railroad, so my mother was the one who was home.
25:56
He was gone two days and home one, or gone three and home two
26:01
or something like that, and that’s what started me for a lot of it.
26:05
Being influenced by Father Stone, who was here, because he was the parish priest of
26:09
a very small parish, but he was awfully involved in all of the institutions.
26:17
Because one of the things he always told me was, and he spent a lot of
26:20
time at our house because my mother used to do the liturgical garments,
26:25
launder them, and the alter cloth, and he would come by to pick them up.
26:29
He’d always sit down at the kitchen table, have a cup of
26:32
coffee and talk to everybody.
26:34
He would say, “You know you always have to go down to city hall to see what’s going
26:38
on, you can’t wait until the overpass is in your neighborhood to say ‘don’t put
26:43
it up.’ You’ve got to find out what the planning is.” And so he always encouraged
26:47
that. He also always showed up at the house around report card time, and he
26:53
would look at everyone’s report card.
26:55
He’d show up at the house around forecasting time for high school, he was
26:59
the one who convinced me to take Russian.
27:01
So,
27:05
he was…but his wife was a teacher.
27:07
She was the second African American teacher who was hired
27:09
here, and so they just spent a lot of time working with kids.
27:13
He would keep the church open here, an awful lot of dances and things went on and
27:17
young people’s fellowship went on here.
27:20
Was there an issue that really galvanized you early on?
27:24
Probably, you know I think my earliest, I think the issue was the election.
27:29
I was always interested in elective politics, even almost
27:32
barely after I learned to read.
27:34
I mean I heard conversations in the neighborhood.
27:35
The first one I remember paying attention to was the ’48 Harry Truman and Tom Dewey.
27:42
I can remember being aware of that one.
27:44
The first one I worked on, I was fourteen years old, was Adlai
27:47
Stevenson, and Dwight Eisenhower.
27:50
Then from that one on I had just sort of worked on every election,
27:56
and yeah, just doing different things and I liked to do the brunt.
28:00
I would go and do the ‘knocking-on-the-doors,’ delivering
28:03
flyers, stuffing the envelopes.
28:06
And this last election I also sat on the corner around there, by the
28:09
coffee shop, registering voters.
28:12
Was there a campaign you enjoyed more than any other?
28:15
I think, and probably a lot of people do, I think the last one.
28:18
Because it was just not something I thought I would ever see in my lifetime.
28:23
At
28:28
one point you mentioned last time that W.E.B Du Bois and Mary
28:31
McLeod Bethune were two authors that had made an impact on you.
28:36
When did you start reading them?
28:37
I started reading Mrs. Bethune probably about seventh grade.
28:42
I started reading Dubois because we had a little, I wish I could find
28:46
that now too, because we had a little copy of The Souls of Black Folk, the
28:51
original, the first printing and I don’t know where I lost that over the
28:55
years, but I can remember reading that.
28:58
It was just really an eye opener.
29:02
These were ideas that you were discussing in the family?
29:04
Ideas discussing sometimes with the family, ideas discussing sometimes
29:07
with the teachers, ideas discussing with Father Stone, you know.
29:11
Because Dubois was an Episcopalian by the way, but, yet, when he founded
29:16
the NAACP, you might have read that we had this long litany of complaints.
29:20
He said, “This and [?] that professes to follow Jesus Christ.
29:24
You know when I got to seminary one of the professors was having us read Dubois too.
29:27
So, what
29:31
did you take away from these authors?
29:33
I took away that, number one you have to really work hard because if you are not
29:41
academically qualified, you don’t learn to think critically, you’re not going to
29:46
be accepted seriously for anything you have to say or anything you have to do.
29:51
So, that was the thing that always gave me the motivation to study.
29:56
And the other thing was the virtue of civic engagement.
30:01
You know, Dubois was an excellent propagandist.
30:05
You know, I went back and most of the older Crisis magazines that he published
30:10
for the NAACP and when he was teaching down there at Morehouse University,
30:17
Atlanta University and the complex, and he started many of the civil
30:23
rights kind of movements in libraries.
30:25
He was the intellectual father of the civil rights movement.
30:32
I’m interested in knowing more about your time in seminary.
30:37
One thing that you mentioned from the last interview is you thought you were liberal
30:40
but you found you were conservative-
30:42
No, that was living in Berkley.
30:44
Because Berkley is a very, very liberal place, and you know when
30:47
I, ‘cause CDSP is adjacent to the University of California there.
30:52
You know, this was in 1983-84 when I went down there.
31:00
And some of those people looked like they had been standing in a closet since 1960.
31:06
So
31:09
people were still having the demonstrations and everything and we
31:12
took our oldest son, whose autistic, we took him with us, and I worried
31:17
about how he was going to get along in Berkley, but you know, he got along
31:22
fine in Berkley because they have a high tolerance for people who are different.
31:26
So in Berkley there was always a demonstration going on down there.
31:35
When we had an apartment assigned us, we couldn’t move in because of Berkley’s
31:40
housing’s a kind of thing, a very liberal thing, you couldn’t just ask
31:43
people to move out because the seminary had bought the building, so we had to
31:47
live in another place for a long time.
31:53
There was some resistance to your interest in attending seminary.
31:56
Yes, this was locally here, because this was still the time when women were not
32:03
encouraged to enter the ordained ministry.
32:08
So even though the church had made that decision in ’76, local diocese,
32:15
you know, a diocesan bishop has a lot of power, and this was one of the ones
32:20
at that time when the local bishop was a part of the Catholic Clerical Union
32:25
and he said women had a right to go.
32:31
He wasn’t going to stand in the way, but he wasn’t going to help anybody either.
32:34
And to this day, the dear man has passed on, but I think if he would
32:42
have had any inkling that we would really make a way to go if he didn’t
32:46
give us any money, I don’t know that he would have signed off on me to go.
32:51
Did any one advocate for you, or were you kind of on your own?
32:54
Well, some of the people did advocate, some of the other clergy in the
32:58
diocese advocated for me because the priest who was here wouldn’t sign
33:02
off for me, the local priest has to sign off, and another priest did.
33:06
And he was taking a chance to do that.
33:10
He did.
33:11
And then a lot of people just encouraged me to go.
33:14
They said “We think you have a call,” and this bishop himself once said “I’m
33:20
really not too sure about women having a call, but I think if women could
33:23
have a call, I think Alcena does have a call.” And while I was there, right
33:29
before the end of my time there, I got
33:34
called in, and there’s somebody who sent you money, but it’s an anonymous gift.
33:39
I always wondered if it was him.
33:42
And he signed my ordination certificate, although he didn’t personally ordain me.
33:48
What was your experience like in seminary?
33:52
By the time got there, about a third or half of the students there were female,
33:57
so that was a very positive experience.
34:00
It was a very…
34:04
that environment was fabulous to have a theological education in because
34:07
there are seven or eight seminaries down there and they’re all part
34:14
of the Graduate Theological Union.
34:16
Everybody from the Unitarians to the American Baptists.
34:20
So
34:24
when you went to a lecture, it was an expert in the field, then you went to
34:27
your own seminary for the preceptorials.
34:29
Then everybody had pooled the library resources, so there were works there
34:34
that you never thought that you’d see, let alone get your hands on.
34:37
So I liked that, and then there were only two persons of color there, another young
34:45
woman who was much younger than I was.
34:48
We were there and we didn’t experience anything related to color.
34:51
Really, nothing related to being female there in the seminary itself, because
34:55
in seminary you just get used to it, and after all, it was in Berkley.
35:00
Did you feel prepared once you completed your training?
35:04
I felt prepared.
35:05
Where I felt unprepared was when I got there,
35:12
because I was already a deacon I wasn’t required to take three years
35:15
there, but I was required to take the same exams as everyone else did,
35:19
who had been there for three years.
35:21
And I felt like I really had to work much harder to come up to speed, but
35:27
then the other part I found out was the practical experience of having been
35:31
in pastoral ministry for five years probably offset some of those advantages
35:37
that I thought other people had.
35:40
What was the transition like for you from the seminary to actually being a reverend?
35:45
Well, it was…
35:48
I was at the school that time, because that’s where I was.
35:52
And that time, the cathedral was there on an Episcopal school campus, so I was
35:57
an associate priest at the cathedral then, and I was the chaplain of the upper
36:03
school, and the dean of the upper school.
36:05
So that was a very positive environment to be around the kids there.
36:12
You know, it’s kind of a rarified atmosphere, because those were kind
36:15
of wealthy kids, with the exception of we had a significant number of
36:21
kids whose parents were from Aramco, whose parents work for Aramco, over
36:24
in Saudi, so Aramco decided it was
36:29
more advantageous economically to pay for those kids to be in the private school
36:36
here and pay for a couple of trips back and forth than to run their own school.
36:42
So that was an interesting experience too, because when you wanted to speak to those
36:46
parents you had to get up and call at two or three in the morning to get them.
36:51
But I only stayed there for one year, and everyone was curious about that, but it
36:54
was just this whole idea that I needed to be somewhere in the center of the city.
36:58
I just really perceived as having an urban ministry.
37:02
And so that’s why I left.
37:03
And the woman who replaced me died up on the mountain with those kids,
37:08
when they lost those nine kids.
37:10
Oh really?
37:10
Yeah.
37:11
And I did go back, the school district permitted me to go back, and I went
37:14
back for a couple weeks to be with that community during the time they
37:17
were getting through all of that.
37:19
Is that when you came to St. Phillip after you left there?
37:23
No, when I left there I went out to the coast range, I was the Vicar
37:28
of Emmanuel Missions in Birkenfeld, which is between Jewell and Mist,
37:34
those are the big towns around.
37:38
This is right by the Nehalem River and then it’s St. Catherine’s in [Claxton?].
37:43
What was that like?
37:44
Well, that was really interesting because they had never seen a, most of them had
37:47
never seen, a female priest, let alone a Black priest and just have one together.
37:52
But the people at Birkenfeld were really welcome and everything.
37:57
I’d been there a while and one of the women, who was kind of the matriarch
38:01
of the congregation came and said, “Mother Boozer, what are you?” I said,
38:05
“What do you mean, ‘What am I?’” She said, “Well, somebody asks and said
38:09
they’d seen you around and they just thought you looked a little bit dark,
38:13
but they weren’t sure what you were.
38:15
So we said we’d ask you.”
38:19
You know,
38:23
it was a good ministry too because out there, I’d always been in a fairly good
38:28
sized parish…, but out there my first Christmas Eve I celebrated the mass.
38:34
You know, this was a place where you had to wait until the people brought
38:37
the water, there was no running water, before you could do communion.
38:40
They had an outhouse which they let me know they had put up there
38:43
for the convenience of the clergy because they could all get home.
38:46
And that first Christmas Eve that I was out there, about the
38:49
time I was saying the Eucharistic Prayer, cattle started [lowing?].
38:53
And
38:55
all the sudden I said, “Yeah, this makes sense, Lord.” You know I thought
38:58
I learned a lot about being out there, and when I left there I came back
39:03
into town and because I went back to the school district as my primary
39:07
job because I always had to have a job so I could afford to be a priest.
39:12
And I was at St. Stevens downtown and Grace Memorial which is over by Lloyd
39:18
Center, I alternated Sundays between there as you know a [dollar a year person?].
39:25
And I did that until 1993, and that’s the time the priest who had been
39:32
here retired and one of them [that series?] had been here after I left.
39:38
The Bishop asked me, he came out to Jefferson High School, Bishop
39:41
[Diablada Ladehoff?] who still lives here, he’s retired now.
39:44
He said, “I have no right to ask you this, but I need somebody to go to St. Phillip.
39:50
You just have to be there on weekends and do the masses, because the lay
39:52
people do the rest of it.” And I thought, well of course, I can’t say no.
39:57
Then once I got here, and these people all knew me, I was raised here,
40:03
but my joke with them was I always wanted to come back somewhere where
40:06
somebody in their late 40’s early 50’s could be called little Alcena.
40:13
And so that’s what I told them when I left too at age 72, it was nice to be
40:18
little Alcena here, in my aging process.
40:22
They were really willing to work because my first sort of little talk
40:27
with them was, this is not my ministry it’s our ministry because I’ve got a
40:31
job just like the rest of you folks.
40:34
And that was a very healthy thing because they owned that.
40:39
And so they were very active in getting the ministries going.
40:43
This was a parish that since Father Stone had left in the ‘70s, it
40:47
hadn’t really been focused outward.
40:50
So one of the first things we did was to, I said, “Well lives around here
40:54
now?” Nobody could really tell me because I had been away for ten years.
40:58
So I said, “Well, why don’t we go out and knock on some doors and figure out who
41:01
lives here.” The response was, “We don’t do things like that, we’re Episcopalians.”
41:07
You know, used to being a school person I said, “Well, we’re going.”
41:12
And we went out and they came back and they were surprised because most
41:15
people thought the church was closed.
41:17
Oh, really?
41:17
Yeah, because the priest who, they had a polish priest here who wasn’t too
41:21
comfortable being in the neighborhood, and he always had the blinds closed
41:24
and the drapes drawn and everything.
41:26
He was a good and faithful priest but he just had some
41:29
concerns about the neighborhood.
41:31
And so when they figured that out I said, “So what are we going to
41:34
do if people think we’re closed?
41:35
How are we going to let them know if we’re here, we’re open, we’re
41:38
trying to preach and live the gospel.
41:41
The people in that housing unit down around, down the next block, it was
41:48
just open, but when we went there, there were actually some bullet holes
41:51
through the door because this was the time the gang stuff was heating up.
41:54
And they talked to people who wanted to visit about how frightening it
41:59
was not to have anything for their kids to do, and it was in the fall.
42:03
We decided to have an All Saints party in lieu of Halloween, but
42:06
invite the neighborhood kids.
42:08
And, you know, about 40/50 kids showed up.
42:12
So, that was all people needed to say, yes, there is a ministry
42:15
here that we need to do.
42:16
We need to do some outreach and we also decided they had been doing a
42:22
once a month feeding of the community.
42:25
I just posed the question, “Do you think people might be hungry more than one
42:28
day a month?” So, then we decided to try to do it every week. And that was,
42:35
that was really a stretch because to get a crew in here to do it, most weeks
42:41
I was here myself cooking, and I had no idea how you cooked for that many
42:44
people. But I thought, I’m the daughter of chef cook it must be there somewhere.
42:50
So, I just did the math and we started doing things and some of the
42:54
women who had been around and had a little better sense helped out.
42:58
There was such a response to that, and we started getting more people to church
43:02
because sometimes people just walk by and would walk in and maybe have a meal, maybe
43:06
not and say, well, gee can I come help?
43:08
And they would help and pretty soon you’d see them on Sunday morning.
43:12
So how many people were you feeding?
43:14
We started out feeding between about
43:21
70 to about 100/125.
43:23
Now they’re feeding 250-300 people.
43:26
Where does the money come from?
43:28
Well, the money, well God will provide if you start doing this stuff.
43:33
I had no idea where was the money was coming from.
43:35
So, one of the first things we do is joined a food bank because
43:38
they get to buy ten cents on the dollar and there are some grants.
43:42
Then as people figured out what we were doing, I’d get these anonymous
43:45
checks ‘for the food program only.’ One young fan I had here, a young
43:52
man died in his early 40s and his mother came up for the funeral,
43:56
they were down the valley somewhere.
43:58
And she was asking me about the food, and I just casually mentioned what we did.
44:03
About two weeks later we get this check for $5000 daughters.
44:05
And I called the daughter-in-law, the widow, and said, “Should I send this back?
44:09
Is she ok?
44:11
Does she have dementia or something?” She said, “Oh no, she’s loaded.
44:14
Keep it, cash it.” So every year that mom would send that check
44:18
on the anniversary of her son’s death until the time that she died.
44:22
Other people, somebody sold a house and said, we really want to help.
44:25
So there’s just all these sources that just sort of come up.
44:29
People will designate for the food program only and the church is very good about
44:34
designating it for the food program only.
44:38
So, it sounds to me like you were providing similar direction for
44:40
the agenda for this church, but it was kind of being developed
44:43
collaboratively as well over time.
44:46
Yes, and I think that’s the way you do it is collaboratively because I
44:49
think nobody will come in and just do your agenda because you say, I’m the
44:52
priest and we’re going to do this.
44:54
No, that doesn’t happen, but if you sort of gently point out to people,
45:00
‘What does the Gospel say we should do again?
45:02
You know, what did Jesus do out there?’ And when they see that they put that
45:07
together and I used to always tell them, I preach half the sermon on Sunday
45:13
morning, you preach the other half.
45:15
And I had a sign down here on the door when you go out, the whole time
45:18
I was here, and it said ‘Reentering the Mission Zone.’ I always wanted to
45:24
reinforce that notion that it’s what we do more than what we say; it makes
45:30
a difference in the lives of believers.
45:33
So, aside from this intensified focus on sort of outreach, are there any
45:38
other ways that the church changed over the time that you were here?
45:42
I think they became more open to incorporating the African American history
45:51
in terms of the liturgy and things because in terms of the [?] the original folk
45:59
who were in Portland who founded this church and everything were West Indians.
46:05
And the people of the West Indians tend to be very high church and very formal.
46:10
Those people and their descendents weren’t exactly overjoyed if you started doing
46:14
some of the little up-beater things.
46:16
I know one time somebody said, “If I wanted that kind of music, I would
46:20
remained in the Baptist church.” You know something like that.
46:24
So gradually we started to introducing some of that, and so in terms
46:28
of making the liturgy more open.
46:30
And that was a way of trying to re-attract the people who left here
46:35
because we have, for the most part, one generation that was missing, the
46:38
people probably about ten years younger than me, that 10-20 year period.
46:44
Because during the time the Black power movements, they
46:46
went off to join Black churches.
46:48
They saw this as going to white church.
46:54
Carl mentioned the demographic of the church has changed a fair amount.
46:57
Well, the racial demographic.
46:59
Yes, because it’s…I haven’t been here for two years, but
47:04
when I left it was about 50/50.
47:07
But the white people who were here are very sensitive to the
47:12
church’s African American history and tend to want to lift that up.
47:20
So you don’t, you haven’t encountered much in the way of
47:22
tension as far as that’s concerned?
47:24
No.
47:26
And I don’t know what will happen, because I know a couple people have mentioned that
47:32
they think it will probably change all the way over and there won’t be anything
47:34
unless people protect that history.
47:37
It won’t be, in many cities it’s happened, you know.
47:41
They have sort of, these smaller churches they have combined churches
47:47
that happened in Oakland, California.
47:50
And when you combine the churches, the one that usually loses the sense is the
47:54
one that’s the African American part.
47:58
I have some names here of people who have been associated with the church,
48:01
if you could share some recollections.
48:04
We’ve already talked about Father Stone.
48:05
Do you want to talk a little bit more about him?
48:07
Well…he was, to me he was also sort of the paradigm of what a pastor is,
48:17
because, as I said, he used to show up at the time report cards showed up.
48:22
My mother also told me stories that when I was very ill as a toddler and had
48:27
pneumonia they weren’t sure I was going to make it, he was sitting there by the
48:30
bedside, you know, helping with things.
48:34
And I know that…because both my boys were born with things wrong, I mean
48:40
I have the autistic son and the other one had congenital [glaucoma?] and
48:44
we almost lost him to post-op stuff, and then Father Stone was there
48:51
to sort of help me through that.
49:09
How about Mercedes Deiz?
49:10
Mercedes was an incredible role model, I think, for all the young women.
49:16
It was Mercedes, she was pursuing law school by being a mom with
49:22
three kids and everything, she would always take time for younger people.
49:26
She always told me, you can be anything you want to be…I
49:34
was still here afterwards.
49:36
I used to go visit her all the time, during her final
49:41
illness; I spent a lot of time.
49:44
But Mercedes was a [?] of woman you know?
49:50
She was sensitive and she was strong.
49:58
So these are some names that Hannah…the past reverends of this church and
50:06
maybe you know some of them better
50:10
than others, but I’ll just go through them: William Vernon Wetzel.
50:12
William Vernon Wetzel was the second priest after Father Stone.
50:20
He was an interesting man and he always preached with his eyes close.
50:23
Everyone wondered why don’t you open your eyes and preach?
50:26
But what he did for this, this had been a mission from 1919 until 1979.
50:29
Bill Wetzel is what
50:37
he was called, Father Bill, he was the one who sort of rose this parish,
50:43
encouraged it to rise up and claim its place rightfully as a parish
50:49
in the church and got people to do all the things they needed to do.
50:53
And he was the one who led us into the Diocesan Convention, saying
50:58
we’ve come this far by faith when we were admitted as a parish.
51:02
He was the one who was here.
51:04
Now, he didn’t believe women could be priests, but he was the one who was
51:09
here and told me that he didn’t have a deacon when I was chewing him out about
51:13
not getting around, and so he was the one who encouraged me to be a deacon.
51:17
He wasn’t too thrilled, he had left here by the time I became
51:20
priest, but when he heard about it he wasn’t too thrilled about that.
51:27
Ramsey Schadewitz?
51:28
Ramsey Schadewitz was the polish priest I told you about.
51:30
He was the one who would personally sign off for me to go to seminary, but he
51:36
was a good and faithful pastor because he dutifully called on everybody that
51:40
was sick and shut-in and everything.
51:43
And he read the daily offices everyday he was here, if it was
51:46
only by himself and everything.
51:51
How about Karl Reich?
51:52
Karl Reich was the, and he pronounced it “rich.” He was the interim who
51:57
was set here after Father Schadewitz retired and he was, again, a
52:06
wonderful pastoral presence and really got along with people well.
52:10
He was a fisherman and went fishing with some of the folks, and he
52:16
was here, I came after Karl.
52:20
Sally Lambert?
52:22
Sally Lambert is a deacon here, and Sally, when I was here, she had been out at
52:28
St. James in Tigard and she left there.
52:31
It was either Christmas or Easter she showed up in the pews here
52:35
and she was here another Sunday.
52:36
And I said, “Deacon, do you have anywhere to be?
52:38
Because I think every clergy person needs to be at an altar.” And she said,
52:42
“No.” Well I said, “Well, why don’t you come here?” And that’s how she got
52:45
here, so she’s been here for a while.
52:49
How about Richard Green?
52:50
Richard Green was the last priest who was here.
52:53
He was the one who followed me, and I had been here for seventeen years and
52:56
that was…but he was a perfect person, you know, God is good to send somebody
53:03
who had the sensitivity, who had the kind of preaching skills, the kind
53:07
of sermons people were accustomed to hearing about and sort of encourage
53:12
people to do what they needed to do.
53:16
He had a good way.
53:18
So the rule is that once you retire you have to leave the parish?
53:22
Yes.
53:23
That must have been pretty difficult.
53:24
Well I knew that was coming, because see I set on the standing committee, the
53:31
diesis.
53:31
I had to be involved, you know, but some clergy needed to be reminded of
53:35
other places that, ‘Hey, you’re 72 its time to go.’ And I understand the
53:41
rationale for that because you won’t have any place for younger clergy and
53:44
the ones coming out if you don’t do that.
53:47
So, I knew that and I think it was harder on the people than it was on me because I
53:50
had expected, and I had tried to prepare them because they thought I was out of
53:54
my mind when I started telling them five years ahead of time, ‘I’m going to be
53:58
retiring.’ They were kind of dragging their feet and one of my little moles
54:03
told me, “You know what they think?
54:04
They think that if they don’t do anything you won’t go.”
54:08
I said, “That’s not even a question.
54:11
I am going because that’s what the church does.”
54:16
How about Kathryn Bogle?
54:17
Kathryn Bogle was a historian, she was a journalist, she was an incredible woman in
54:27
terms of how she used to organize, because there was some journals of hers around
54:30
here, I found one in the in the kitchen one day up on a shelf, where she organizes
54:35
YPF groups when Father Stone was here.
54:39
So, she encouraged her son, Richard Bogle, he was well known around here he was both
54:44
television newscaster and on the city council, we just buried him last year.
54:49
Kathryn lived into her 90’s and she was very clear right up until
54:55
the day she left this earth.
54:57
She always took pictures, sent notes, and you probably read one
55:01
of her histories at the parish.
55:08
Talk a little bit about the connection between the church
55:10
and the Urban League of Portland.
55:11
Ok, well the church in the Urban League when Dr. Unthank I believe
55:16
was on that board at that time when they were organized, and then he was
55:21
very active with Bill Barry who was the executive director for a while,
55:27
and with E. Shelton Hill who was the executive director for a while.
55:31
And they always, many of the Urban League meetings were hosted here, they
55:35
wanted those pictures somewhere around somebody [because?] one of the meetings
55:39
that was here, the year [?]. And
55:44
they sort of made sure that league had a place to go and to grow and then
55:50
another person, I don’t think whose name has come up yet but, Gertrude Ray.
55:55
Gertrude Ray was the secretary of the Urban League here to Mr. Hill
56:01
in places, and then she became the director of personnel for the league.
56:06
And she was, and she had grown up in this parish and she was very active
56:09
too, so those were connections.
56:11
And Myrtle Carr, who’s in her 90’s now, and she was also in the office there.
56:16
So, in between the staffing of the league the people here had a,
56:21
maintained a very natural connection between the parish and the league.
56:25
And so that kept the parish advised to what the initiatives
56:29
were going on at any given time.
56:31
Whether voter registration or anything else because up until the time that I
56:35
left, Ms. Carr was still standing up reminding people when every election
56:39
came up to get those ballots in.
56:42
So that’s a big focus of the Urban League?
56:46
Yes, and employment, that was another part.
56:49
And when Father Stone was here, and the league and the employment, he
56:55
sort of was an informal employment counselor for the league too, and Ms.
56:59
Ray was very active in sending people out on job interviews and things.
57:04
So they would prepare people…
57:06
They did prepare people very well.
57:11
I wonder if you could comment a little bit on race relations in Portland
57:14
and how they’ve changed over time?
57:16
Well, they’ve changed, for the most part, formally, you know it gets back
57:22
to this question de facto and de jure.
57:25
From the de jure standpoint they’re very good.
57:29
De facto, sometimes they leave a little bit to be desired.
57:33
I think the most glaring example now is the relationship between
57:38
the police and the Black community.
57:41
It’s still a very stressful relationship, I mean you still, I’ve had the
57:47
conversation with my grandson and my son [whose dad does too?] about how you
57:51
must behave when you come in contact with the police if you want to live.
57:59
When was the, when I was in the schools I know sometimes coming home from the
58:03
game on Saturday night you’d see the kids out in the streets, and some of
58:07
them were just doing what kids do, and the policeman would have them
58:10
up there ‘hands up’ and everything.
58:12
I’d stop my car and say, “Is there a problem officer?
58:15
I’m the principal of the school.” Then they would sort of stop, but that’s still
58:20
going on and probably will go on for a while until there’s, you know, the police
58:25
here don’t even have an evaluation system.
58:27
That astounded me.
58:28
We were at a meeting, the ministerial alliance with the mayor, and I can
58:32
remember posing that question saying, “Tell me how your evaluation system
58:36
works.” And he kind of hesitated for a minute and then he had to
58:40
acknowledge, “We don’t have one.”
58:45
How about the gentrification of, especially this part of town?
58:49
That’s a sore point because, you know, the people who used to live around here could
58:55
no longer afford to live around here.
58:58
If you drive around Portland much you’ll see something you never used to see and
59:03
that’s a large number of people of color living out beyond east of 82nd avenue.
59:08
But that happened with the gentrification and the way people sort of first made
59:14
sure there were no services down here so the area kind of deteriorated, and
59:17
then when it was at its rock bottom price came in and purchased all the
59:21
land and then started developing
59:25
it.
59:25
How is your activism changing?
59:28
My activism is changing by, in some ways, moving, slowing
59:32
down a bit, but not too much.
59:35
Because every time I think I’m going to slow down I’m going to another meeting,
59:38
there’s another cause that comes along and you decided that as long as you’ve
59:41
got strength you’ve got to do that.
59:44
And the activism takes on not only against races but against ages,
59:49
you know, because you find lots of things, terms of medical facilities,
59:56
insurance and things for older persons.
59:59
My latest little thing is going to be with the providence system because
1:00:04
the tool program they have, water aerobics program for older folk there,
1:00:09
they’re getting ready to close it.
1:00:11
Because they can make more money by putting a surgical suite in there or
1:00:14
something, but anyway, we organized a little letter writing campaign, and so
1:00:20
yesterday the folks were very concerned about, ‘Well, what if they don’t read the
1:00:23
letters and they don’t do anything.’ And I said, “That’s the first move. You kick
1:00:28
it up a notch, and if they don’t respond to letters, then we call Channel 2.
1:00:34
They don’t respond to that, then we’re out on street with our walkers and
1:00:37
with our canes and in our wheelchairs.”
1:00:42
You mentioned satisfaction that you felt working in the Obama campaign,
1:00:47
what was it like the day he was elected?
1:00:51
You know, I could just remember crying a whole lot because I had
1:00:54
been working in the local office up here on Killingsworth Street.
1:00:58
There were a bunch of young kids there from all over the country there, working,
1:01:01
because I could remember taking a pan of spaghetti there too and those kids
1:01:05
were out there in the street partying.
1:01:07
They put up a great big sign saying, ‘Yes, we did.’ But the question now is can we
1:01:14
reignite all that enthusiasm this time around, because I think people are pretty
1:01:21
comfortable thinking, ‘Oh, well there’s no way he’s not going to win again.’
1:01:25
But that’s being very gullible I think.
1:01:31
Have you reflected much on your own life as being a sort of a pioneer or mentor?
1:01:37
You know, I keep saying I’m going to write something for my grandchildren,
1:01:41
and I think I will do that, but you know it was just last month or so
1:01:45
I got around to writing my will.
1:01:47
I thought, ‘Well, I’m almost 75 years old, I’m not going to be here forever.
1:01:50
I probably better do that.’
1:01:53
But the reflection, the whole thing about it is, I was always greatly
1:01:58
surprised by whatever I did because I was the meekest, mildest, scariest
1:02:05
little kid in my family out of six kids.
1:02:08
Older brothers and sisters always said, “Well, speak up for yourself,”
1:02:11
and everything. So, it was always a great big surprise to me when
1:02:15
something changed, and it was always a recognition of, you know, you never
1:02:21
know what God has in store for you. And the best thing is to try to open one’s
1:02:27
self to go along with whatever comes.
1:02:30
And the other thing I learned was not to take myself too seriously, take my
1:02:35
work very seriously, but not myself.
1:02:39
Because I had to discover that, kids helped me discover that when I was
1:02:42
a principal at school, you know, because the kids were tough over there.
1:02:45
They weren’t very excited, you came up and said you’re the
1:02:47
principal they’d say, so what.
1:02:53
Well, that’s the end of my list.
1:02:54
Is there anything else that you want to talk about?
1:02:56
I just want to know about what the things that you’re reproducing and things,
1:03:02
will they be available in a bank online?
1:03:04
For the researchers?
1:03:06
That’s great, really, because that’s the one thing I worried about is what
1:03:11
happens to the history of this place.
1:03:13
Well, that’s what we’re trying to do
1:03:17
is to capture as much of that as we can and preserve it for future use.
1:03:18
Good, good.
1:03:20
Well, thank you so much for doing that.
1:03:23
You’ve guys got a great job.
