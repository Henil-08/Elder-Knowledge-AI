00:07
Okay Carl, so we are going now.
00:11
If you would, just go ahead and state your name for me.
00:14
Carl Deiz.
00:16
Spell your last name for me.
00:18
D-E-I-Z.
00:22
Carl, when were you born?
00:25
November 16, 1920.
00:29
And where were you born?
00:31
Portland
00:34
Have you lived in Portland most of your life?
00:37
All of it.
00:39
Except in the service.
00:43
Were your parents – where were you parents, where were they born,
00:46
were they born in Portland too?
00:49
No they weren’t.
00:53
My mother was born in Nebraska and my dad was born in the West Indies.
01:02
Oh really?
01:03
And how did they make their way to Portland?
01:09
He made his way on the railroad and my mother came out with her
01:21
mother and father in about 1918
01:30
to live in Portland.
01:34
And why did that family move to Portland, from Nebraska?
01:38
Not sure.
01:41
And they met in Portland?
01:43
And they met in Portland.
01:46
And so did you father continue to work for the railroad?
01:50
That was his occupation?
01:51
He did.
01:51
Yeah, until he retired.
01:54
And was your mother employed?
01:58
No.
02:00
Did you have any siblings?
02:02
I had one older
02:09
brother.
02:10
And what was his name?
02:12
Robert.
02:13
Is he still alive?
02:15
No, he passed two years ago.
02:22
So you went to school in Portland?
02:24
And
02:27
what schools did you go to?
02:29
In Portland.
02:30
Richmond Grade School and Franklin High School.
02:35
So are they in Northeast Portland?
02:38
No they are in Southeast Portland.
02:44
And so that’s the area that you grew up in then.
02:46
Yeah.
02:48
So after you graduated from high school you went into the military.
02:53
No I worked on the railroad for a
03:00
couple years.
03:01
And what did you do in that job?
03:04
A waiter.
03:05
You were a waiter?
03:07
Did you enjoy that work?
03:11
It was work.
03:13
Talking earlier amongst the group it sounds like that was an occupation, an
03:18
industry that a lot of African-American folks were employed in at that time.
03:24
That’s right.
03:24
It was a
03:29
major source of work.
03:33
The railroad, the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific, and both of them
03:40
had crews that worked out of Portland.
03:45
Uh-huh.
03:45
And so were you drafted into the military?
03:51
Drafted.
03:54
What year?
04:04
I wish I could remember… 1942
04:13
I guess, maybe.
04:16
And they, so where did they station you?
04:19
I
04:23
was sent to Montgomery, Alabama.
04:33
And what was your impression of Montgomery, Alabama?
04:36
Well, I never saw it.
04:40
All I saw was the airfield and I don’t…I was there a few months
04:53
or so and I never saw Montgomery.
05:01
So was that basic training?
05:05
Or the training that you went through in Montgomery?
05:08
Yes.
05:10
And then where did you go after that?
05:16
After that I went to…
05:25
I don’t know I’d have to get a map to see where I went.
05:30
I went to Arkansas I think
05:36
for a short time.
05:42
Where did you spend the majority of your military career?
05:45
In what area or areas?
05:51
Mainly in
05:55
Alabama.
05:58
So you were part of the Tuskegee Airmen-
06:01
Yes, but that was a long way from
06:10
the part of, where you left me.
06:15
Oh, okay.
06:16
Can you take me through that?
06:18
Oh, okay.
06:21
When I was in Alabama, my brother was in
06:30
Tuskegee, Alabama and he talked to one of the
06:38
captains there to see if I could get transferred over to Tuskegee and he
06:54
sent the word over to
07:00
make the transfer to Tuskegee and I realized that if I went to Tuskegee
07:08
that would mean I would be where there were hundreds of people trying to
07:18
advance themselves that are already in the service and so I turned the
07:29
offer down and went to Arkansas.
07:35
And I was able to get out of Arkansas to
07:44
officers school in Miami in about a month.
07:51
Which I felt if I’d had gone to Tuskegee I’d have been
07:55
lined up behind the thousands.
08:01
Anyway, that got me to Miami.
08:05
I got out of there in I guess about 90 days.
08:10
And then I was sent to Tuskegee.
08:14
And when I went there the first captain I meet is one that says
08:21
“Oh so you finally arrived!”
08:26
And you spent the rest of the time in Tuskegee for the most part?
08:31
Your military days?
08:33
Sorta.
08:38
I
08:48
applied for the
08:54
cadet training which at that time I was commissioned so the application
09:07
didn’t go through the normal situation.
09:11
But
09:14
anyhow,
09:17
I
09:20
got assigned to a cadet group.
09:23
There were about 30 cadets and 4
09:34
officers in the group.
09:39
And since
09:44
we didn’t live with the cadets or eat with the cadets, we stayed at the
09:58
Bachelor Officers Quarters, BOQ, and at the Officers Club.
10:11
What duties did you have during your military service?
10:20
I spent one
10:28
full set of time
10:38
as
10:42
training…pilot training.
10:46
I went through
10:51
the full thing from Basic to Advanced training.
11:03
Then
11:07
at the end of that time, upon my last eye exam, I didn’t pass it.
11:18
So I stayed at Tuskegee and became a supply officer at Tuskegee.
11:28
My class graduated and went on to fly and up to Michigan, I think
11:40
is where they went initially.
11:44
But then they were overseas later.
11:49
And your brother was a pilot.
11:50
And my brother was a pilot.
11:54
When were you discharged from the military?
12:03
In ’45
12:08
I think.
12:13
And you returned back to Portland at that point?
12:15
Yeah.
12:18
I returned to Portland and I continued
12:28
in the military
12:34
as
12:38
assigned to the airbase.
12:44
Not as active duty but as
12:55
assigned there
13:01
just so that you could continue to stay associated with the military.
13:17
And I stayed there until, oh, two or
13:30
three years and then I was at the University of Portland and
13:37
I got out of the…and I dropped the military ties all together.
13:47
So did you go to UP on the GI Bill?
13:50
Yes.
13:51
And what did you study?
13:55
I
14:00
studied
14:06
Business Administration I guess.
14:12
Did you finish your school work there?
14:14
Yes.
14:16
And then you entered the work force at that point?
14:23
Yes.
14:24
I
14:31
entered the work force as a
14:37
federal employee.
14:41
I think I
14:46
was at
14:50
Bonneville Power initially.
15:02
And in what capacity were you at Bonneville Power?
15:05
What were you doing there?
15:10
Initially
15:22
I worked the
15:28
front door.
15:34
I mean, as people came in I would tell them where to go and what they want…who
15:43
they wanted to see and things like that.
15:47
But then I got assigned to the
15:53
accounting department.
16:01
That’s where I stayed for awhile.
16:07
So you worked at BPA for several years?
16:11
Yes, mm-hmm.
16:12
Did you eventually go to a different company or a different organization?
16:23
My, you’re getting me to go back in years.
16:32
I worked for Bonneville and then I worked for
16:39
the outfit down at Tillamook…It
16:55
was…I should have , if I’d had an idea you were going to ask about this, I could’ve
17:12
looked back into history because I worked
17:20
the Forest Service and I…a certain time with them.
17:27
And
17:30
when I was in Tillamook it wasn’t in the Forest Service,
17:33
it was…Lord knows who it was.
17:40
Were you still doing accounting this whole time or was it different work?
17:44
It was always basically either accounting or supply.
17:52
One way or another.
17:56
And I wound up back in Bonneville again and
18:04
I retired from Bonneville.
18:07
I spend about 30 years there.
18:13
So that was a building here in Portland?
18:15
Eventually.
18:16
I spent
18:20
some time in Bonneville in Vancouver at
18:26
the sub-office there in Vancouver, I was
18:33
the supply officer there.
18:39
So were you living in Southeast Portland during this time or did you…where
18:43
did you establish your residence?
18:46
In North Portland.
18:49
Out near Portland University.
18:54
And so you lived there for many years?
18:56
Yeah, I moved out there in ’49
19:07
and
19:11
lived on Portsmouth Street.
19:16
And then I think about ’63 I moved to build a house on Chautauqua and
19:27
moved there and that’s where I am now.
19:30
Is that also North Portland?
19:31
Yeah.
19:34
So that neighborhood has probably changed quite a lot over the years.
19:37
Oh, did it!
19:39
Because
19:44
Portsmouth is a little further west than Chautauqua and when I was first out there,
20:00
there was very little building between the two.
20:05
And now there’s a whole city out there!
20:09
And just a couple of days ago I went out and drove around through there
20:21
just to see what it’d look like because
20:27
one of my granddaughters had picked me up over on Portsmouth one time and she
20:33
sort of drove through there but not any reason, just taking me back home.
20:43
And
20:46
it got me interested in going back and just this past week I went back and drove
20:53
around through there and was just amazed about how much had built up out of there.
21:01
It’s practically a whole city.
21:06
When did you meet your wife?
21:10
In
21:14
about
21:21
1948
21:24
I think.
21:28
We
21:32
were both working for the federal government.
21:38
I
21:53
was working for the federal government and she was too but she left the
22:00
federal government and took a job with
22:10
some attorneys.
22:15
And
22:19
from there she went on to law school and from law school to
22:27
lawyering and to becoming a judge.
22:31
Where
22:34
did she go to law school?
22:38
At
22:41
Northwestern College of Law.
22:43
That was before it became part of Lewis and Clark.
22:49
What year were you married?
22:53
’49.
22:54
And how many children did you have?
22:58
We had three children.
23:03
And what were their names?
23:14
Bill,
23:23
and Karen and Gilbert.
23:30
Bill
23:34
had come from New York with his mother when she came out here in about
23:46
’48 so that’s
23:52
part of what caused me to wonder about the timing there.
23:57
Because she,
24:03
when we got married I
24:07
adopted Bill and
24:11
then the other two children were born.
24:17
Who has been influential in your life, what people have influenced you?
24:33
That’s a
24:36
pretty difficult question.
24:39
I
24:48
feel that
24:51
there hasn’t been
24:58
nearly the
25:01
influence that you might expect.
25:08
I spent
25:15
time in college – four years at University of Portland – and then directly to
25:30
work and didn’t have any opportunity in-between times for influential people to
25:49
lend a time.
25:51
The only hand I can think of was
25:59
when
26:02
I was planning to go to Portland; I was influenced to go from engineering,
26:13
which I thought I was going to take up to business administration.
26:21
And that was influenced by the assistance of the people at
26:30
the University of Portland.
26:33
And
26:37
the minute I started working for the government I found out that the
26:46
engineering was the way I should have gone because all of the initial, the opening
26:58
jobs in engineering were two grades higher than all the business portions.
27:07
But I was already there then.
27:17
Well, this church is obviously important to you.
27:21
What other things in your life have made an impact like this, if anything?
27:32
Any other groups or organizations or…?
27:36
Not that I can think of have had any
27:47
bearing on the
27:55
church.
28:02
It didn’t have so much influence as the fact that I just continued with
28:11
accounting work with the church and
28:18
still doing it.
28:22
What are some of your hobbies?
28:27
I
28:31
was interested in photography, I
28:37
was quite
28:46
interested in
28:50
picture taking.
28:51
I’ve had
28:54
a couple of cameras and
28:59
used them pretty extensively.
29:04
The
29:09
thing I guess I, I might say I was interested in traveling.
29:13
I’ve
29:19
traveled around the states, followed
29:31
Disneyland from the L.A. to the Florida.
29:38
And in fact just about every year we’d be up to one or the other.
29:51
We’ve traveled to Europe and
29:58
we traveled to North Africa, we traveled to Japan and we
30:12
made a short trip over to China.
30:22
And that’s about the way we spend our time until we had enough kids that it
30:35
kept us from…Keeping them in school
30:42
sort of cut down on the traveling to some extent.
30:50
How about social life her in Portland?
30:52
What were some of the places you’d like to go to
30:58
hang out with your friends.
31:02
Well, we weren’t
31:09
much of a
31:16
builder of the social life.
31:26
Can’t think of anything I…I belonged to a fraternity
31:35
but
31:38
it didn’t tie up
31:43
too much of…too much time.
31:47
Was that a fraternity from college or later?
31:50
Later.
31:53
No, there was no fraternities during the college years.
31:58
What was the name of that fraternity?
32:00
Alpha Phi Alpha.
32:06
Are there any other important events in your life that you would want us
32:09
to know about as we prepare to talk to you further in a couple weeks?
32:24
I can’t
32:29
think of anything.
32:40
No.
32:49
I like to cruise.
32:51
We
32:54
did that as part of our traveling, we cruised to South America and cruised to
33:08
Hawaii.
33:17
No, I’m
33:22
pretty thin on ideas.
33:26
Okay, well, thank you Carl, I appreciate it.
