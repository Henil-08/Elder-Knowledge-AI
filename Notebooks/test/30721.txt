00:02
Ok Carl, if you would just go ahead and introduce yourself again today.
00:04
Give us your name and today’s date and
00:08
our location.
00:11
I don’t hear too well, if you talk softly like you were I don’t hear you.
00:20
So your, name, today’s date, and our location.
00:24
Carl Deiz,
00:28
May 30,
00:32
2012, and St. Philip the Deacon Church in Portland, Oregon.
00:43
Carl, I’m interested in learning more about your life as a child here in
00:47
Portland, if you could talk a little bit about your childhood, maybe
00:50
the neighborhood you grew up in?
00:51
What that was like?
00:58
Well, I was born in Portland in 1920
01:08
and
01:11
lived there until after the World War II.
01:24
What it was like?
01:35
Its hard to say, just
01:42
an ordinary neighborhood, went to grade school there, then to
01:53
high school from the same house.
02:07
I really don’t know which way you want me to go.
02:11
Well, what was your neighborhood?
02:13
Was it mostly African American folks, or was it racially mixed?
02:20
It was racially mixed.
02:26
There were
02:30
about three African American families within a mile and were about
02:45
four or five Chinese families and all the rest of them were white families.
02:55
Did people relate to one another pretty well, did they get along
02:59
ok, or did it feel more segregated?
03:03
There was no feeling of segregation, it was just the fact that you were
03:04
the only family and you related to the neighbors in what seems to be a
03:09
normal fashion.
03:10
What
03:39
kinds of things did you like to do when you were a child?
03:44
Did you play sports?
03:48
By child do you mean up to six?
03:53
When you were, let’s say, up to your teenage years.
03:57
Up to when?
03:57
Up to your teenage years, when you were young.
04:00
We,
04:16
there was
04:19
not activities such as you find nowadays.
04:23
We
04:25
joined the boy scouts, my brother and I were both in boy scouts, troop 39,
04:41
we were the only two Blacks in the troop and it didn’t seem to make any difference.
04:58
We met at Richmond School, for the most part, and
05:08
that
05:11
seemed to be the only group.
05:16
We went to the Presbyterian Church which was about seven blocks away for
05:30
sort of a summer school.
05:40
There was nothing like that at St. Philip’s at that time, and so we
05:55
went there for their summer classes.
06:05
I felt that we learned quite a bit through those summer classes, more about
06:18
the history of
06:24
the,
06:29
not of the church, but the beginning of Christianity and the early days.
06:35
Learned
06:38
more there then we did any place else.
06:47
I know your brother was a track and field athlete; did you participate in
06:51
athletics when you were that age as well?
06:57
Well, when I was in high school I went out for track, but
07:05
that was about it.
07:07
I didn’t try baseball or basketball or any of the other things.
07:18
So scouting was one of your main extracurricular activities
07:21
when you were growing up?
07:29
Yes, it was a weekly thing and we had scout camp that we would go to
07:40
during the summer, usually a week or two of camp.
07:50
How long did you stay in boy scouts?
07:58
Did you get to be an eagle scout?
08:00
No, we
08:09
never
08:12
built into the scouts, didn’t even reach life and that’s a pretty low level.
08:20
In
08:23
fact I can’t remember what the grades were as you came along.
08:31
It was only one or two grades of scouting, we never, always looked forward looked
08:44
at the eagle scouts as something that was
08:50
attainable, but never thought of reaching for it.
08:56
Did you have a job when you were growing
09:02
up?
09:02
Paper boy.
09:07
At that time there
09:11
was a weekly paper called the, I
09:21
don’t know what it was called.
09:26
I thought of it this morning, but it’s escaped me right now.
09:32
But it was a weekly paper, it isn’t delivered anymore.
09:40
I don’t know how long ago it gave out,
09:46
but that was
09:50
50 years ago.
09:54
Did you enjoy school?
09:57
Yeah, school was
10:01
a pleasant time
10:07
and
10:11
classes
10:17
were interesting.
10:29
I guess I enjoyed going, I went without problems.
10:38
Was it mainly white kids at this school or was it racially diverse?
10:45
Well,
10:48
in grade school there were
10:55
no other Blacks at the school we were in and that didn’t
11:04
seem to make much difference.
11:07
In high school there were…by the time I graduated I think there
11:19
may have been four Blacks in the
11:24
school.
11:35
There were no segregated clubs of Blacks that I know of, there were none
11:46
in that school, there may have been some in other schools, in schools such
11:56
as Jefferson, but not that I know of.
12:02
So, it sounds like you were treated pretty well growing up, for the most part.
12:06
Yeah.
12:08
What were your parents like, how would you describe your parents’ personalities?
12:14
Well,
12:17
my dad was a waiter on the railroad and my mother never
12:27
worked, she was always a homebody.
12:34
She was,
12:38
I would think, more athletic than most.
12:42
She
12:48
could
12:50
about outrun us until we got up to
12:58
the top grades of grade school.
13:04
She was
13:17
always active.
13:27
So, your dad was gone a lot for his job?
13:30
Yes,
13:34
you’re out
13:37
three days, home two days and that’s about the way it would work.
13:46
What were some of the things you all did as a family together?
13:49
What was important for the family to do things together?
13:56
Was church part of that?
13:59
No it wasn’t.
14:06
The
14:12
grandmother lived
14:18
and mother lived together with my dad.
14:23
Grandfather passed away
14:29
when we were quite young.
14:38
They were all very active with the church.
14:47
My dad sang in the choir and
14:55
mother was part of the guild and did work like that.
15:08
You grew up during the Great Depression?
15:11
Do you have any recollections of what that was like, the difficulty of
15:15
living during the great depression?
15:17
None at all.
15:19
At that time my dad worked and we never seemed to notice it
15:42
with any difficulty.
15:45
How about any of your friends, did you notice anything of their lives?
15:49
Not really.
15:54
Well, I want to talk to you a little bit about Tuskegee, and I’m
15:57
wondering what your first impressions were of the whole Tuskegee program
16:03
when you arrived there initially.
16:09
Well, this is a
16:12
strange situation because my brother had gone to Tuskegee.
16:23
He had volunteered and
16:28
went in
16:32
as an aviation cadet.
16:35
He
16:41
had graduated and was a pilot before
16:53
I was drafted.
16:55
I had applied also but the
17:03
situation was such that you…there was quite a backlog of people
17:11
trying to get in, and I was drafted.
17:16
And when I was drafted, my letter arrived saying that I could be accepted as a
17:27
Tuskegee cadet, but it was too late then.
17:32
And so I was drafted and went to Alabama as my first
17:47
place.
17:49
And my first place to
17:55
realize that segregation was the army.
18:05
You may not have realized that much in your home town of Portland, Oregon but
18:17
when you got into Alabama and the army you realized that segregation was a fact.
18:31
And it was a fact until about,
18:37
maybe, about just a few years ago.
18:40
I’m
18:50
sort of…my mind is sort of wandering because just thinking that segregation
18:58
ended in the army and I just wonder is it also going to end in the church.
19:08
But
19:11
that’s another problem.
19:16
Now I’m in
19:22
Alabama and from there I went to
19:32
another airfield in…
19:36
Was
19:40
it Arkansas?
19:43
Yeah, I think so.
19:45
And then from there I went to training as a
19:55
officer candidate school in Miami.
20:00
That was a 90 day school and I graduated from there and
20:08
then I was sent to Tuskegee.
20:13
And that was my first time, my second time for seeing Tuskegee.
20:21
When I was in Alabama my brother flew over one time to
20:34
Maxwell Field, Alabama and picked me up and took me back to Tuskegee
20:41
where I spent an afternoon and an evening with him and had dinner at the
20:49
officers club and then took the bus back to my airfield which was about
21:02
40 miles away.
21:08
And now I have arrived at Tuskegee and
21:16
I
21:20
was assigned to a
21:25
training cadets, I was
21:38
assigned to the same captain who had requested me from Alabama
21:48
but had…didn’t accept his change.
21:55
So he said “So you finally have arrived”.
21:58
So that was odd, it was Captain Jones, was the head of the squadron.
22:07
I
22:15
have trouble remembering whether they called them the squadrons or
22:22
exactly how they designated the units.
22:29
But he was captain of a unit and I was assigned to him and from there I
22:42
went and got assigned to Pilot Training,
22:53
which meant that
22:57
about 6 months after I had tried to get in earlier, I finally made it.
23:05
Unfortunately I passed everything and got ready to graduate and
23:16
flunked the final eye exam.
23:21
And then I decided
23:27
to,
23:31
basically, to get out.
23:34
And I
23:38
got out basically because they had so many Black officers that they
23:46
didn’t’ know what to do with them.
23:49
They stacked them up at Tuskegee and then you could apply to get out
23:59
as excess or whatever.
24:05
So I got out, came home and signed up
24:16
for University of Portland.
24:22
What was the Pilot Training like that you had at Tuskegee, can you tell me a little
24:27
bit more about the training that you did?
24:31
It was
24:38
three classes; your primary class was at Tuskegee Institute, which was about 40
24:51
miles away from the Tuskegee Airfield.
25:06
You had your primary training there and that’s where you
25:11
first got your solo training.
25:15
And you had several hours of solo flight before you left
25:30
your primary group.
25:33
Then you went to Tuskegee Institute for basic and advanced.
25:39
The basic training was about two months in a
25:47
aircraft that had a fixed wheels on the thing,
25:58
the wheels were always down.
26:04
Then
26:07
you completed that training and you went to advanced training and at advanced
26:13
you had an aircraft that had wheels when you took off, the wheels would fold up.
26:23
And
26:28
you had two months training there.
26:36
I got enough training there that when I got out I was able to
26:43
get my civilians pilots license.
26:51
And so I became a civilian pilot and flew out of Troutdale
27:00
for just whenever you wanted to take someone up for a ride, you
27:09
could give them a ride around, out from the field at Troutdale.
27:16
Was
27:20
that something you ever thought about pursuing as a career?
27:23
No, I never thought of that.
27:29
Were, so were the people who were doing the training at Tuskegee, were
27:32
they white or were they Black folks?
27:38
They were both.
27:41
The pilot training, at the initial part of it, was all white officers.
27:57
When my brother came back from overseas, he became a trainer.
28:04
And
28:08
some of the Blacks got into the training end of it because they
28:21
had a lot
28:29
of time
28:38
with no true assignment.
28:42
They weren’t being sent overseas initially.
28:50
And so they were training mainly in Michigan and
28:59
they got involved in
29:07
coming back to Tuskegee Airfield and doing some training for the
29:16
pilots, for the training people there.
29:20
But it was sort of strange the way it warped you.
29:34
By not going overseas, they were trying to find reasonable jobs for them to do.
29:47
So were there, was, did, was there a sense of... You talked about the
29:53
segregation within the army but you had the white trainers and the Black
29:57
soldiers who were learning from them.
29:59
Did you have a sense of tension between those two groups or was there not so much?
30:06
No, it
30:09
didn’t seem to make any difference.
30:13
What was it like for you to be exposed to Black folks from other
30:16
parts of the country, from the South, where they’d had a very different
30:19
experience than you growing up?
30:27
I
30:31
didn’t have that much interaction.
30:36
I
30:40
just
30:44
stayed usually with a
30:50
group of one or two people that I was
30:59
acquainted with and we sort of hung out together.
31:10
But
31:14
any relation between the…the relationship between the whites and the Blacks was not
31:30
a group where they operated together except in their work.
31:39
There was no
31:44
living in the same are or anything like that.
31:48
Do
31:50
you feel that the Tuskegee Airman have been represented accurately
31:55
in movies or books or in the things that you’ve read or seen on tv?
32:02
I think so, I think they’ve given them a pretty good
32:12
showing of…the problem is,
32:21
I think the most interesting
32:26
show was
32:30
Red Tails, which is currently
32:39
being shown at some theaters around but the only problem with Red Tails is that
32:48
it eliminates Tuskegee all together.
32:54
Tuskegee is where they trained initially and
33:03
this gets them already through training, through…and already overseas, which
33:20
is quite a story in itself, of how they trained and went to Michigan and
33:27
trained more and then some were shipped overseas and some flew airplanes overseas.
33:38
My brother was with a group that flew from the states and flew
33:45
their airplanes to North Africa.
33:49
But
33:53
there was…at that point they were still a completely segregated unit.
34:04
No whites involved at all.
34:10
Did he talk much about the missions that he flew as part
34:12
of the Tuskegee Airmen with you?
34:14
Your brother?
34:15
Not at all.
34:16
Not at all?
34:18
He didn’t talk about the War?
34:22
Not at all.
34:22
Really?
34:26
What was your brother like?
34:28
Tell me a little bit more about him.
34:32
Well, he
34:37
was more athletic, he was a
34:45
track man mainly.
34:48
He did go out for football one year but he stayed away from it from then on.
35:00
And he
35:08
was given a scholarship to University of Oregon, a track
35:13
scholarship, and that’s where
35:24
he stayed for three years.
35:28
He didn’t finish there because he volunteered for the cadet training and
35:36
missed his, the end of his forth year.
35:41
So he had about three and a half years of college before
35:53
he went to Tuskegee.
35:55
And at Tuskegee he
36:01
graduated there, he got his commission and
36:10
he was stationed…he was there two different times, he was there before
36:25
he went to Michigan and then they went overseas and then over to Africa and
36:33
then to Italy and then he came back.
36:40
And…I
36:49
have trouble putting his life together, it’s
36:59
because he was at Tuskegee when they had
37:07
B-25 bombers there at one time.
37:11
I
37:16
think they did.
37:16
And
37:20
he would, he would fly one of those, fly it to Portland with
37:35
group of three or four people, you know, would come up and visit.
37:43
Did he stay in the military after the War?
37:46
He did, he stayed in the military
37:54
for a
37:57
number of years and he
38:05
got involved in
38:16
the development
38:25
of landing planes and such as that where you didn’t, where you
38:34
would land on instruments only.
38:38
And he was in the development of that for quite awhile.
38:50
Instrument landings and things such as that.
38:55
And then he got out of the service and…and
39:12
worked for the state of Ohio.
39:19
I’m
39:24
trying to think of,
39:30
well, he was a
39:35
parole officer for the state of Ohio for awhile.
39:42
Because he said once when he wanted to come home he decided the best thing to
39:46
do was put his guys back in jail, so he’d knew where they were when he got back.
40:02
Don’t know how much was fun of that or not.
40:11
Were you in Portland when the Vanport Flood happened in 1948?
40:16
Do you have any memories of that?
40:20
Yes,
40:28
I was.
40:36
I had
40:42
a
40:44
residence in Vanport
40:54
which was
40:59
a secondary residence, I still had my home but I had
41:07
a residence at Vanport
41:15
and when the flood came I lost a
41:23
very nice radio and record player that was
41:36
about the only thing of my own that was there because Vanport
41:44
supplied you with your beds and
41:48
your base equipment was part of Vanport.
41:59
But that was about the only thing, I think, of mine that I lost at Vanport.
42:04
But you knew a lot of people who were affected by it, by the flood?
42:09
Yes, uh-huh.
42:14
No one seemed
42:21
to be,
42:24
no one that I knew, seemed particularly disturbed by it.
42:31
Most of them moved to Portland and
42:40
got reasonably good housing in Portland, the ones that I knew.
42:46
I didn’t know that many people in Vanport because I was
42:52
sort of a temporary resident.
42:59
How did you meet the woman who became your wife?
43:06
We both worked for the Federal government.
43:10
And…I’m trying to think,
43:42
at
43:45
that time she had
43:50
come from New York City with
43:56
her son Bill.
44:00
She had
44:04
separated from her husband
44:19
and they came out to Portland.
44:24
And
44:32
I’m
44:38
having trouble trying to figure out…she was working
44:54
for Bonneville,
44:58
in the library
45:01
and…Now I’m…When I met her I think she was
45:17
working
45:24
for the Federal Government
45:33
and I was also working for the Federal Government when we met.
45:38
And
45:42
we
45:46
just started going together.
45:51
I was still living in Southeast Portland, the same place I’d been since birth and
46:11
we
46:14
went together for awhile and
46:23
we got married.
46:25
That’s the simplest way to put it.
46:29
So she went to Law School and became a lawyer and then a judge.
46:33
And she was the first African-American Female judge in Oregon, correct?
46:37
Right.
46:38
And see she…After she left
46:52
Bonneville and she went to work for attorneys at…And was
47:08
working for them about a year and
47:13
one of them was Graham Walker.
47:17
And he said, suggested that she oughta go ahead and
47:27
go to Law School.
47:30
And
47:32
they also assisted her in the beginning of going to Law School.
47:45
But she,
47:50
at that time Law School was a night law school.
47:56
And
48:06
that was before
48:10
she moved out to Lewis and Clark and all that.
48:20
They would meet at night
48:26
downtown somewhere;
48:31
there was the law school that
48:37
took about three or four
48:42
rooms in a building down there, downtown somewhere because
48:52
that’s where she started law school.
49:03
Can you talk about the process about how she became a judge?
49:07
Well, that
49:13
process she
49:18
became first an attorney and had her own office and
49:31
she…I
49:45
have trouble going back into
49:53
history, I’ve…because at that time we were married, when she was going
50:07
to school, because…I don’t know.
50:32
I’m at a loss for trying to
50:38
build her time at…
50:46
Do you remember if there was resistance to her becoming a judge?
50:49
Huh?
50:49
Was there resistance to her becoming a judge, do you know?
50:52
No, none that I know of.
50:57
She…The
51:07
only problem was
51:13
setting up, you had to set up your own organization, and that was,
51:28
she had a couple of attorneys that were, that she had met and
51:36
worked with as an attorney when she
51:45
decided to try for the judge, they helped her
51:54
set up
51:58
the organization to run.
52:01
Because you…The thing that helped her a lot was once she
52:24
graduated she went to work for
52:34
the state
52:38
in…you’re going to have a lot of blank space on this tape.
52:48
She
52:56
went to
52:59
work for the state and I’m trying to think of the organization she worked for.
53:24
I can’t think of it off hand, but it was an organization that
53:37
helped
53:46
the word SAIF
53:51
is the initials, but I can’t think what they stand for.
53:57
But that organization is one that she worked for.
54:02
And in that they did
54:11
work similar to a judge.
54:17
And that was what sort of got her into
54:26
going from that to the judge.
54:29
Because I think that’s where the step that was made.
54:38
You must have been very proud to have her be the first Black judge in this state.
54:45
Well,
54:49
I
54:53
felt that…that she really wasn’t the first Black, I mean there
55:09
were…Aaron Brown was a judge.
55:09
And
55:21
he was in a different capacity but as a judge and
55:41
… I don’t know.
55:44
She became a judge first in the Juvenile Court
55:57
and,
56:04
yeah, that’s where she first became a judge, in the Juvenile Court and then she
56:16
graduated.
56:17
She applied for the Circuit Court and then when she…and each
56:32
time she won, she was elected.
56:37
I don’t think she was ever defeated.
56:42
So,
56:53
then she was Circuit Court judge and stayed there for…several terms.
57:17
Did you help out with those campaigns for her election?
57:22
I assisted where I could,
57:30
mainly in
57:36
helping keep on track of the money and the various
57:49
situations.
57:50
There
58:03
was always the necessity for having two or
58:13
three strong people in the organization in order to run
58:27
and both times she’s had good people with her and behind her on that.
58:54
It would be worthwhile to note who they were but I would have
59:00
to go back to get that, I can’t remember all those things from
59:15
30 years ago.
59:19
Did you participate at all in the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and
59:36
1960s?
59:36
Not…Not as such.
59:47
I
59:51
was
59:54
part of an organization that
1:00:02
was
1:00:11
very much involved.
1:00:14
My trouble is
1:00:18
not knowing of this question, I would have to go back to look to the name of
1:00:33
the organization and things like that and
1:00:41
which
1:00:44
parts I was involved with.
1:00:49
Was it the Urban League?
1:00:54
I was a member of the Urban League, but
1:01:05
not basically in a Civil Rights
1:01:13
area.
1:01:14
Do
1:01:17
you recall what the impact of the Civil Right movement was in this area?
1:01:24
The things that were happening with Dr. King down south for example?
1:01:29
The
1:01:45
only thing is
1:01:54
the Civil Rights movement
1:02:05
arrived…Was already organized
1:02:19
and
1:02:22
pretty well underway when it arrived here.
1:02:29
Yeah,
1:02:44
I would have trouble
1:02:48
without checking back on what organizations were involved
1:02:59
and how they were involved.
1:03:12
My involvement was not
1:03:17
great.
1:03:24
I was a member of the Urban League and
1:03:37
other organizations but
1:03:43
taking a forward part in those organizations…I don’t think I
1:03:50
was ever that much involved.
1:03:54
Well,
1:03:57
the last time I was here, you talked about your relationship with this church
1:04:01
a little bit, you were at St. Philip from 1921 – 1950 and then you were at
1:04:06
St. Andrews from 1950 – 1963 and then you came back to this church at that point.
1:04:12
Why did you decide to go to St. Andrew’s for that period of time?
1:04:16
It was mainly because St. Andrew’s was within walking distance.
1:04:27
Although I don’t think I ever walked there.
1:04:34
But
1:04:38
we drove up there but it was in the neighborhood.
1:04:49
I felt that,
1:04:54
at that time we had children going to
1:05:06
St. Andrew’s and it was
1:05:11
convenient to have that happen.
1:05:26
You also mention that during that time that St. Philip changed from a mission
1:05:30
to a parish and that was important?
1:05:33
Yes, uh-huh.
1:05:34
It…That was,
1:05:48
I wish I could, if I had the names of the ones were involved in that change,
1:06:00
I thought that was quite important but
1:06:07
my part, I hadn’t even got back into
1:06:15
St. Philip’s by the time that they had made their move
1:06:23
from a mission to a parish.
1:06:28
I was really happy to see them do that and that got me to thinking
1:06:35
whether St. Andrew’s is a mission or a parish because it was
1:06:53
sort of on the
1:06:56
edge but I don’t know which way it is right now?
1:07:04
What are your memories of Father Stone?
1:07:16
Well,
1:07:21
he gave me a car one time.
1:07:29
He didn’t drive, I
1:07:32
mean he didn’t have a car and someone gave him a car and he passed it on to me.
1:07:45
And…He
1:08:07
was a real force in the community.
1:08:15
He…I’m trying to
1:08:29
see
1:08:36
where
1:08:43
he…My part being that I’ve been out of the community for so long,
1:08:59
living out near University of Portland, that I
1:09:07
just don’t see the
1:09:13
things that go on in the area of St. Philip’s.
1:09:30
Just, right now, we’re thinking the area of Mother Boozer because
1:09:45
she was more of a force in the community because she was in
1:09:51
the school and things like that.
1:09:55
Reverend Stone
1:10:00
was
1:10:04
helpful but
1:10:12
I can’t relate
1:10:21
it.
1:10:23
Well, how do you feel like the church has evolved over the
1:10:26
time that you’ve been here?
1:10:27
I mean it’s certainly changed a lot, maybe talk a little bit more about
1:10:33
the time that Alcena Boozer was the reverend here and since then.
1:10:42
Yes, well,
1:10:53
it had developed
1:10:56
into the parish by the time she had arrived.
1:11:09
I’m trying to figure whether
1:11:19
the church was here at the time she arrived or was it
1:11:25
still in the other building.
1:11:38
I don’t know exactly.
1:11:48
She…I’m trying to think how the church has developed
1:12:19
as…see, part of the problem with the church is where it is.
1:12:32
The church,
1:12:37
theoretically, was basically what was
1:12:47
- have to go back to the word – in a Negro neighborhood.
1:13:00
And now at the present time, the neighborhood is
1:13:11
very mixed.
1:13:12
And
1:13:15
I’ve
1:13:18
never been in the neighborhood itself but only as an observer of
1:13:28
it.
1:13:30
I feel that the church in itself has got much more…integrated.
1:13:52
Any number of the
1:14:00
officers and organization people that are currently working in the church
1:14:15
are, it’s a very integrated group.
1:14:21
Much more than it was
1:14:26
when Father Stone was
1:14:32
here.
1:14:33
There was
1:14:37
maybe one or two whites that…Now, I would look out in the audience and it’s
1:14:49
more getting closer to half and half.
1:14:54
And
1:14:59
it’s integrated like the army.
1:15:03
Yeah, referring back to that earlier statement that you made about the church
1:15:08
being segregated, how has that changed the dynamic of the church, do you think?
1:15:23
I don’t…I don’t know that it has changed it that much because
1:15:33
it,
1:15:36
the growth was so gentle, it was never any
1:15:56
problem in one group meeting with the other.
1:16:03
They always have moved together very naturally and normally.
1:16:16
I want
1:16:22
to ask you about race relations in Portland.
1:16:25
Do you feel like - that there has been a change over time, in the
1:16:29
many years that you’ve lived here?
1:16:31
In terms of the way the different races have gotten along in this city?
1:16:42
I don’t know, I…I’ve been here
1:16:55
haven’t seen a problem
1:17:01
of how they’ve gotten along.
1:17:12
I’m trying
1:17:18
to think back through the years and um-
1:17:25
It doesn’t sound like you’ve had very many negative incidences in your
1:17:28
life, as for as that’s concerned.
1:17:34
Only one, in about 6th grade,
1:17:43
a fellow called me a name, and I chased him down the hall.
1:17:49
But that was about the
1:17:53
only thing I can remember.
1:17:59
And…difficulties,
1:18:13
I don’t know whether it’s been a problem with
1:18:20
getting jobs or
1:18:26
not.
1:18:27
Myself I’ve normally
1:18:32
been with the Federal Government.
1:18:37
In first one job or another, its
1:18:52
difficulties are just
1:18:58
getting along
1:19:01
and making your way.
1:19:06
What did you think when Barack Obama was elected president?
1:19:10
Did you ever think you would see that?
1:19:13
I didn’t think I would ever see that
1:19:18
and
1:19:22
I was quite happily surprised when it happened.
1:19:36
But now he’s been with us a few years and we’re gonna try it again.
1:19:50
The last thing I wanted to ask to you about was, the last time we talked
1:19:53
you mentioned you’ve traveled an awful lot in your life, all over the world.
1:19:57
Are there any particular experiences from your travels that made an
1:20:01
impact that you’d want to share?
1:20:06
I can’t think of
1:20:11
any that had
1:20:15
any affect.
1:20:24
Every place we’ve gone, we’ve been well received and sometimes we’ve
1:20:36
traveled with groups and sometimes just
1:20:45
Mercedes and
1:20:49
I travelled.
1:20:55
Never ran into a problem.
1:21:02
Okay Carl, well, unless you have something else that you want to
1:21:05
talk about, that’s all I have
1:21:17
on my list.
1:21:17
The only thing was
1:21:23
what
1:21:26
I sort of refer to of the army becoming non-segregated and I’m
1:21:39
just wondering if the church is going to be making that same move.
1:21:47
What do you mean by that?
1:21:48
Tell me a little bit more about that.
1:21:51
Well,
1:21:56
St. Philip’s is
1:22:02
considered
1:22:07
a Black church.
1:22:12
Hardly you could consider it that if you come and look at it.
1:22:17
But it’s still listed as a Black church and there are
1:22:31
about…anywhere you go you’ll find
1:22:37
somewhere there’s a Black church.
1:22:44
There are enough of them that they have an organization of…that meets
1:22:59
somehow and somewhere
1:23:06
as a Black organization, which I’ve never quite figured out why.
1:23:23
That’s basically what I have been wondering.
1:23:38
I don’t know.
1:23:43
What do you think?
1:23:45
Well, it sounds to me like this church is an example of how things are changing.
1:23:50
And over time that change will probably continue to happen
1:23:53
around the country I would guess.
1:23:56
I mean it happened in the military, it happened in this place so
1:23:59
maybe it will continue to happen.
1:24:03
Yeah, well, I just wonder how much
1:24:10
background
1:24:15
can hold it off
1:24:20
and…
1:24:23
But you would like to see more change in that direction?
1:24:28
Yes,
1:24:31
I feel that
1:24:37
I was at St. Andrew’s for a number of years and part of the organizations and
1:24:49
went to the convention as a member of St. Andrew’s with Father Four [?] who
1:25:00
was the minister there at the time.
1:25:04
And
1:25:08
I just,
1:25:19
I just don’t see why it needs to be separated but whether or not it’s a
1:25:29
worthwhile thing to be separated in order to get the group together whereas
1:25:38
there may not be enough feeling for one or two to go in to a church and
1:25:52
be the new negro in the area
1:26:03
or how do you do it?
1:26:09
For example the church over here, the handy one, has
1:26:21
one or two Blacks
1:26:26
but I can’t think of any other church where any go at all and
1:26:35
yet there are numerous Black churches which have no whites
1:26:46
which is the
1:26:50
same thing only the other way around.
1:27:01
Okay, well, thank you Carl.
