00:00
Today is February the 18th, 2014.
00:03
I am lucky enough to be sitting with Mr. Earnel Durden, and we are going
00:07
to be talking about his history of playing at Oregon State University.
00:11
But we’re going to start before that, in terms of him talking about his growing
00:15
up experiences, and then eventually getting to Oregon State University.
00:18
So it’s going to be what we call a life history interview, Mr. Durden.
00:22
I want to just say, thank you very much, and what I want you to do is
00:25
just to say your full name, your date of birth and we’ll start from there.
00:31
My name is
00:36
Earnel Durden and I’m seventy seven years old.
00:39
I came to Oregon State in 1955 as a freshman, and I played on
00:46
the 1957 Rose Bowl team that played Iowa in the Rose Bowl.
00:48
I had some great experiences here at Oregon State.
00:53
Some experiences that I do not ever wish to change, of course as a young
01:00
freshman on campus there were some that took me out of my element.
01:06
I was raised in Los Angeles, born in Jefferson, Texas—a little
01:11
small town in Texas—and I was only there once after I left there.
01:17
When I was three years old my family moved to Los Angeles, and they took up shop
01:22
in the building war materials for war.
01:27
They moved myself and my two brothers to Los Angeles.
01:34
I was raised there, in Los Angeles, and early in my life I
01:41
became somewhat of a musician.
01:45
[Laughter] My mom insisted we learn some kind of music, and she set us down and
01:52
said, ok pick the instrument you want.
01:55
So I had one brother who picked the trumpet, the trombone,
01:59
and I picked the clarinet.
02:01
We
02:03
became very well-schooled in those instruments.
02:07
Every week my mom would set us off to school and for our lessons and learning
02:13
to play these music instruments.
02:15
By the time I was in junior high school I was pretty good.
02:20
I could play any reed instrument there was and I could read the music.
02:28
I found myself bouncing around in little bands at that time, and I
02:36
thought I was on my way music-wise.
02:39
One
02:42
day I was sitting in the bleachers watching the football players and
02:48
I said to myself, you know what?
02:51
That looks like fun and looks like something I could do.
02:54
So I went in and talked with the coach and asked him if I could
02:59
become a member of the team.
03:02
He said, yeah, you can.
03:06
He brought me in, gave me my little uniform, my shoulder
03:09
pads and my helmet and
03:15
put me on the B team.
03:18
[Laughter] B team was the lowest you could be at.
03:20
Then
03:23
I started my career in terms of playing football.
03:31
He put me down as a defensive tackle.
03:33
I was really proud of myself and proud to be a tackle, proud
03:38
to be on the team, really.
03:40
That grew and somewhere along the line, as I approached the ninth grade, they
03:48
switched me and I became a running back.
03:55
About that time in my life my mom bought a home in the Los Angeles area.
04:03
During the time I was in high school I was being raised in a
04:07
place called Watts, and Watts was about a ten by ten area, community,
04:17
and we called it the Real Watts.
04:21
After the riots in Los Angeles, anywhere that there was a cluster of African
04:28
Americans, they call that Watts.
04:30
But that’s not really Watts.
04:33
But anyway,
04:36
I enrolled in Manual Arts High School and that’s where my
04:42
football career really took off.
04:43
And I had to make a big decision, whether I was going to stay with my
04:48
music, which I was very comfortable with and by that time I could play a
04:53
lot of instruments, the piano, and I had been introduced to that arena and
05:01
I felt very comfortable in that arena.
05:04
Somehow, I got caught up in the scheme of football.
05:11
By the time I was a senior in high school, our football team
05:15
had won the city championship.
05:18
I was selected on the all-city football team, I led the city that
05:23
year in eighteen touchdowns, which was a lot then but not so much now.
05:29
Then there was a lot of schools that came calling.
05:36
I had already made up my mind where I was going to school.
05:37
And where was that?
05:37
UCLA.
05:37
I was going to go to UCLA.
05:45
All the time that I was being raised in Los Angeles that was the school for me.
05:49
I remember some of the great players in those days; [Edgar?] and Villanueva,
05:55
First Down Brown, some of these guys and boy I sure wanted to be like them.
06:00
Most of all I wanted to play in the Rose Bowl and I figured if I
06:03
went someplace else I wouldn’t get a chance to play in the Rose Bowl.
06:06
I
06:08
sure wanted to play in the Rose Bowl.
06:11
Had you followed Jackie Robinson’s career?
06:13
Yeah, I knew of Jackie’s career at UCLA and that was another factor for me.
06:20
There was other black players who had done well at UCLA which also motivated
06:26
me that this was where I wanted to go.
06:34
So did UCLA sort of have a reputation by that point when you
06:38
were making your choices as being a place where black men could go
06:42
be successful and get playing time?
06:44
Yes.
06:46
That was a major factor and during those years, SC
06:54
was black listed in the black community.
06:57
Tell us what that means.
07:01
It was looked upon with favor for many young black athletes going to
07:09
USC by the time I was coming up.
07:10
And the reason for that was because there was a young black athlete who was
07:15
from same area who was recruited very heavily by a lot of schools, including
07:21
some of the schools back in the Big Ten, but chose SC and after he was
07:25
there for a couple years he went in to ask the coach why he wasn’t playing.
07:31
He said, I know I’m better than those guys you got playing for
07:35
you, so why am I not playing?
07:37
And the coach says, oh, you know we didn’t bring you here to play, we brought you
07:43
here so you wouldn’t play against us.
07:46
It shocked this guy, I mean he was stunned.
07:49
So he packed up and went back to San Diego and he became the first
07:56
black police officer in San Diego.
07:59
The ironic thing about him was that the day that he retired from the
08:06
San Diego Police Department, he found out he had passed the bar.
08:10
He became a lawyer.
08:11
[Laughter] He became a lawyer.
08:12
Anyway, I knew the story because this was a story that was floating around
08:18
the community that I grew up in,
08:22
but I didn’t know the guy or anything about him, just what
08:27
had happened to him at that time.
08:30
Then of course when I moved to San Diego I found out, I learned who this guy was.
08:35
He was a member of the Richie family, who was a very prominent
08:38
black family in San Diego.
08:46
They were a relatively wealthy family.
08:52
That was the reason that even Jonny Arnett, some of the other
08:56
guys who were big SC people.
09:01
Jon played at my high school and he left a year or two before I got there
09:07
and he came back and he said, we really want you over at SC and things
09:12
are not the way they used to be.
09:14
I said, Jon, I’m not going to SC.
09:16
I said, you are wasting your time,
09:21
no disrespect to you.
09:23
Jon was a good guy.
09:25
So my thought was I was still going to UCLA.
09:30
Then all at once, Tommy Prothro was recruiting for UCLA at that time.
09:35
He was an assistant coach, practice coach, recruiting at that time.
09:43
He became interested in me.
09:47
I guess what we had done in high school, in terms of our team, our term was
09:53
recognized throughout the state because we were an awesome offensive football team.
09:59
He became interested and he started to recruit me to UCLA.
10:04
This is what year, roughly?
10:07
This is around
10:12
1954.
10:12
He started to recruit me and most coaches have guys and people who they
10:18
will say, go out and talk to this guy.
10:21
These were typically black men?
10:22
Yeah.
10:25
The guy that was assigned to me was a guy by the name of Horace
10:28
Johnson, who was kind of a leader of the black community, kind of.
10:34
He came over to my house and talked with my mom and talked with me,
10:39
he was trying to convince me.
10:40
During this particular time Tommy Prothro didn’t know of it when he first started
10:46
recruiting me, but then he had been offered the job here at Oregon State.
10:53
When he knew that he was coming to Oregon State he asked me to
10:58
come to Oregon State with him.
11:01
I said, oh boy.
11:04
I don’t know anything about Oregon State, I have no idea where it is,
11:11
I had never seen them play in the Rose Bowl.
11:17
[Laughter] I don’t know about that coach.
11:19
So he sent Horace Johnson to my home, Horace talked to my mom, he talked to
11:25
everybody he could talk to, my relatives.
11:27
One
11:30
night I was sitting down with my mom and she
11:34
says, well what do you think?
11:35
I said, I don’t know, I said, what do you think I should do?
11:41
She says, I have no idea.
11:46
She said, the only thing I can do for you is to pray for you and ask God
11:53
to help you with the right decision.
11:57
So I went back to school the next day and I was messing around at school and
12:04
all at once a friend of mine who played on our team, there were three all-city
12:08
guys on that team—myself, Ted Bates, and a guy by the name of Willard Pen—Ted
12:14
says, you know, this school is really after me and I’m thinking
12:19
really seriously about going there.
12:20
And I said, what school is this?
12:21
He says, Oregon State.
12:23
Oregon State?
12:24
They’ve been after me also.
12:26
I said, are you thinking about going there real seriously?
12:29
He said, yeah.
12:30
I said, well that helped me make up my mind.
12:32
Interesting.
12:34
So as time went on we both decided that we were going to come up to Oregon State.
12:39
What was the reaction like in your community when you made that announcement
12:41
that you’re not going to UCLA?
12:43
It was kind of silent.
12:46
I didn’t hear very much about it because they all thought I would be going to UCLA.
12:51
Here is the best running back in the city of LA going to someplace like
12:58
Oregon, where in the hell is that?
13:00
[Laughter]
13:01
I get
13:03
you.
13:06
Ted and I, Horace Johnson, who was also interested in Paul Lowe.
13:11
Paul Lowe went to Centennial High School which was in Compton.
13:14
It was a little [suburb?] outside of LA.
13:18
He was an awesome talent.
13:22
Just awesome.
13:23
The thing that was more intriguing to Prothro about him was the
13:28
fact that in high school they ran out of the balance wing offence.
13:35
He just said, I have to have this guy.
13:39
He sent Horace over there and Horace went over there to work on his family also
13:43
like he did my family and Ted’s family.
13:46
To make a long story short,
13:50
in those days there were coaches that stole players.
13:54
Tell us about that.
13:56
Sam Wesley was one.
13:57
Sam Wesley came from Dallas, he was on his way to the University of Oregon and
14:02
he got off the bus at the wrong stop.
14:05
They kept him
14:09
here.
14:09
[Laughter] He became a beaver rather than a duck.
14:15
In those days, guys would take players that were on their way to one university.
14:20
Somebody was on their way to the University of Virginia and some scout;
14:27
some recruiter from another school would intercept him and talk him
14:30
into going to Georgia, or someplace.
14:33
So Prothro was a very wise coach, he decided that wouldn’t happen to him.
14:40
So he put Ted, myself and Lowe in the back of a ’55 Mercury and had Horace
14:46
drive us from LA to Oregon State.
14:51
Boy that was an uncomfortable ride.
14:53
Three big guys in the back of a car, with your luggage and all of that in the trunk.
14:57
With
15:01
Horace and his wife.
15:03
So we drove up here and
15:07
it was in the fall of
15:13
1955 and that was the day I became a member of the Oregon State community.
15:20
Can you tell us about your first memories of coming on campus?
15:23
You arrived in ’55 in the fall, what was it like?
15:27
We arrived here about,
15:30
it was dusk.
15:32
I remember getting out of the car and looking around.
15:36
It was dusk, we went inside, put our belongings in, it was Weatherford Hall
15:41
we lived in, that we were assigned to.
15:48
The next morning, Ted and I got up, we put on our jackets.
15:53
You know that summer we had been going from place to place playing in these
15:57
All Star games, and this one game in San Diego, the bad part, all-star game
16:04
City of San Diego SCIF Southern Section.
16:08
These beautiful jackets: white sleeves and blue with red trim.
16:13
We put on our jackets, boy we were walking around the campus and we
16:18
came upon this lady who was walking this little boy and as we passed this
16:25
little boy looked at us and said, mom, look at that big old black man.
16:33
[Laughter] Oh boy, I knew I was out of my element.
16:38
I knew I was someplace that I had to make some great adjustments if I was
16:45
going to stay here and during my freshman year I thought about leaving many times.
16:52
Coach
16:56
called us in the office and talked with us, and
17:01
he said to me,
17:05
life is going to throw you a lot of curves and it’s not whether it’s
17:10
going to throw you a lot of curves, is going to be how you deal with them.
17:14
I don’t think there was anything racial this little boy said, it
17:17
was just something he was not accustomed to, you know, he just
17:21
wasn’t used to seeing black people.
17:28
I hung on a little bit longer, but I was totally unhappy being at
17:33
Oregon State in my freshman year.
17:36
We’d have, always have these eyes on us, people were always staring us down.
17:42
There were no black girls on campus, and the boys that were dating white girls,
17:47
the administration didn’t like it.
17:49
So they would call the girls in, to talk to the girls, but
17:52
they never talked to the boys.
17:55
My reasoning was, I figured out that the reason they didn’t talk
17:59
to the boys is because they didn’t want it to become a national issue.
18:02
They’re these football players, football players with some ability and some steam.
18:07
They didn’t want the national press to get a hold of this kind of stuff.
18:11
So they talked to the girls, the girls would come back
18:13
and tell us what they said.
18:16
You know this went on.
18:19
I believe that during the time that I was here had a lot to do with
18:25
Oregon State recruiting black girls.
18:28
I really believe that.
18:30
During my junior year, the first black girl came on to campus.
18:35
They made it known that they were going to actively start recruiting black girls.
18:39
Oh really, they made that
18:43
note?
18:43
The first black girl came on campus, her name was Rachel, she came on campus.
18:48
My senior year, the second black girl came on campus.
18:51
So when I left here there were two black girls on campus.
18:55
And several of the boys who were dating white girls married them.
19:01
Including this African guy, Minsu [sp?] , married a Caucasian
19:05
girl here, his daughter became
19:09
Cum Laude at Harvard.
19:11
And Minsu [sp?] became one of the world’s most important metallurgic
19:18
people and he was still sought after.
19:21
The state department would come and ask his opinion on all kinds of stuff.
19:25
He was right here from Oregon State.
19:28
But he was also from, you remember you told me he had come as a foreign student.
19:33
At the time he was there it was called the Gold Coast, and while he was here
19:38
on campus the name was changed to Ghana.
19:41
Yes, that’s right.
19:44
He was a brilliant guy.
19:48
There were four of them that came.
19:50
We never
19:52
included those guys in the other, you know…
19:55
Yeah, because they were really foreign
19:59
students.
19:59
Anyway, there were four of them.
20:01
Minsu [sp?] and then Cujo was a guy
20:08
I took a lot of time with in fact he went home with me one summer.
20:11
Interesting.
20:12
And then Bruce, Bruce was a guy who would talk to nobody.
20:15
He left Oregon State and the next thing I hear from him is he’s
20:19
getting his masters at Syracuse.
20:21
Oh, nice.
20:22
And I don’t know what happened to the other guy.
20:24
Alright, let’s come back to your time in that first year
20:28
when you arrived on campus.
20:30
Any recollections of some of the things you were doing as a student.
20:34
Taking classes, that sort of thing.
20:37
Yeah, it seems that I spent a lot of time
20:41
being concerned about what people were thinking and that took up a lot of
20:47
time when I should have been studying.
20:49
Anyway,
20:53
I remember this one class that I had, chemistry.
20:58
There
21:02
were a lot of professors at the time on this campus that didn’t give a darn
21:06
who you were, football player, or not football player and if you didn’t do well
21:09
in that class they’re going to flunk you.
21:13
There were some people that leaned toward football players and there
21:16
were some that just didn’t care, like it probably is right now.
21:22
Yes, it is.
21:23
I was in this chemistry class, having a hell of a time in chemistry.
21:28
One day this professor called me in and he said, Earnel,
21:36
you’re not doing well in this class.
21:39
I said, yeah, I know that.
21:41
He said, you’re going to have to do a lot better in order to pass this class.
21:47
He said, let me tell you something,
21:53
if you flunk this class,
21:57
they’re going to condemn your whole race, you guys just can’t make it, especially
22:03
a football player, you can’t make it, but if a white guy fails this class, they’d
22:07
say, oh well he just didn’t have it.
22:10
That stuck with me and to this day that was embedded in my brain.
22:15
Here was a white professor telling me that I better get my ass on the
22:18
stick, and I better start studying.
22:22
I went home and I put in the time and I passed that chemistry class.
22:29
I never will forget that guy.
22:30
I don’t know how he looks, I can’t picture how the guy looks, I can’t even
22:35
picture anything about him, except for the words that came out of his mouth
22:38
to me that day, but he motivated me to no extent; not only in the chemistry
22:44
class but in other classes that I took.
22:47
I just made up my mind I would not go home having flunked out
22:50
of college, I wouldn’t do that.
22:53
That put me in a position where I studied and studied and studied and
23:00
to the extent that I did graduate on time.
23:03
You did and you got a degree in Physical…
23:06
I got a degree in Physical Education and in Science.
23:09
I could teach any physical education, art, science, biology and kinesiology
23:14
which I became very proficient at.
23:22
I remember during my sophomore year, things started to light up a bit.
23:29
Perhaps people had gotten used to me, seeing me on campus, I certainly got used
23:34
to people seeing other races intermingle with other people, this kind of stuff.
23:42
Things were starting to clear up for me a
23:47
little bit.
23:47
When
23:49
the football season started, when the football season starts you have little
23:54
time for anything because not only do you spend a lot of time in football
24:00
meetings, in football practice, but then you got to have your studies
24:05
and I find myself having no time for anything but football and studying.
24:13
I remember that year, the first game that we played against UCLA,
24:21
the school I wanted to go to, and came here.
24:25
It was raining just like it is outside right now, it was raining.
24:28
It was 1957 and Prothro
24:34
was not the guy for a lot of talking.
24:37
He wasn’t for this “hoorah” type of thing.
24:39
He was sitting down just before we took the field, and went down
24:44
to get dressed, we were sitting down having our pre-game meal and
24:50
he got up and walked around.
24:52
He
24:54
looked out the window, it was raining,
24:58
he came back, he looked at the squads, he said,
25:03
the team that wants it most today is going to win this game.
25:08
That’s all he said?
25:08
That’s all he said, then went and sat down.
25:11
We went out there that day and we just kicked UCLA’s
25:18
butt.
25:18
I’m sure to this day that we did not have the talent overall that UCLA
25:24
had on that team, I know Pete O’Garro was on that team and he was awesome.
25:28
He went up and he spent all fourteen years playing up in Canada
25:32
and he was really, really great.
25:34
I don’t know if you’ve heard of Pete O’Garro?
25:36
He’s dead now.
25:39
They were an awesome team and we beat them, we beat them that day, put them on
25:43
the thirteen, right here on this field.
25:49
That was in my mind and never left, that great speech because as I became a
25:56
coach in the National football league, these head coaches I would run across,
26:01
they were really fire and brimstone type but never like Coach Prothro,
26:07
very calm.
26:08
I started to kind of figure out, the reason that he didn’t do that, and
26:14
this is me thinking, because they knew as a coaching staff they had
26:20
prepared us like no other team, that we were so prepared we could do what we
26:26
needed to do, and they didn’t have to…
26:30
Give a fire and brimstone speech, right.
26:33
Because they only last for a few minutes anyway, and after the first five or
26:38
ten minutes you lose that on the field.
26:41
If you don’t have what it
26:44
takes…I
26:47
learned my sophomore year, very similar to my freshman year,
26:52
that this was some of the toughest guys that I had ever come in contact with;
27:00
guys that didn’t have ability, but
27:05
were absolutely tough football players.
27:09
As we went through our schedules, team after team after team fell in front
27:16
of us, then we met that UCLA team
27:21
here on the field and
27:24
I think that year we lost to SC
27:29
and we lost to Washington, only two losses for that whole year.
27:33
That was your first year?
27:34
First year as a sophomore because we couldn’t play as freshmen.
27:41
So is that considered a turnaround season then?
27:44
For the team?
27:45
The turnaround season I believe came in ’55 when I was a freshman.
27:51
They didn’t win as many games, but boy what a great, great effort.
27:56
That was the team that upset Stanford, I think went through this.
28:01
The team when I first saw, what I thought, was an all American Football
28:05
player, Sam Wesley, who John Brodie, was a great player in those days.
28:10
I don’t know if you remember him, John Brodie and Isaacs was a great
28:16
receiver, and Bill Tar was a great running back, all from Stanford.
28:22
They came to Oregon State, they played Oregon State in
28:25
Multnomah Stadium in Portland.
28:27
I was a freshman, I sat in the stands, and I saw this little tattered
28:32
group of guys fighting this giant and overwhelming team, Stanford.
28:41
Stanford would march up and down the field, but they could not get it in.
28:45
They could not get it in and twice, down on the ten yard line John Brodie
28:49
went by and he spotted [Isaacs?] in the center and let it fly and Sam Wesley
28:54
would come up with the interception.
28:57
Oregon
29:02
State ended up winning that game 12-13?
29:06
I don’t really remember what the score was at the close of the game.
29:09
They won.
29:09
Years
29:13
later when I started to coach for Coach Prothro, we talked about that
29:17
team and he admitted that it was probably his favorite team, the ’55
29:24
team that gave so much with so little.
29:28
I
29:30
remember some of the players on that team, boy I looked at
29:33
these guys, Howard Buettgenbach.
29:36
Howard was about 6’6”, 195lbs, he was a tackle.
29:40
[Laughter] He had
29:45
play this big guys from Stanford,
29:52
260-270 lbs… [Laughter] But that was the kind of grit those guys had: Norm Thiel,
30:06
DeGrant, Joe Francis, Jesmer,
30:13
Witte, John Witte, all these guys were on that team.
30:16
Not a lot of talent, but a lot of heart.
30:22
We went through that season, when I was a sophomore, pretty handedly, lost pretty
30:28
close fights to SC and to Washington, and it came down to, we had three games
30:35
left in the season, and it came down to
30:42
we had to win two of the three remaining games in order to go to the Rose Bowl.
30:48
We started off with Stanford, at Stanford, Palo Alto.
30:52
That was the game that Paul Lowe hit me on an out and up pass, and went
31:00
sixty yards and we pulled that one out.
31:05
We came back to the campus, that night, and our whole team was totally exhausted.
31:14
We were exhausted, guys going to sleep on the bus, on the plane.
31:20
We got on the bus, and we landed out here in Corvallis, a big jet, I don’t
31:25
know how…anyway the bus came and picked us up and guys were nodding
31:33
as we drove back to the campus.
31:35
All at once, I’m half asleep,
31:40
and the bus hit the curve and drove up on the lawn by the Memorial Union.
31:46
And I’m thinking, what the hell, what is he thinking?
31:49
Is he drunk?
31:50
What the hell are you doing?
31:54
Then we get out, and I didn’t see any of the student body, and we go
32:01
inside the student union and everybody is there and they are yelling and
32:06
cheering and all this kind of stuff.
32:09
That
32:11
was my first impression that…
32:14
They were also calling your name too, weren’t they?
32:16
Yeah, they were saying, we want Durden, we want Durden.
32:21
I was thinking to myself, I wasn’t the only one doing these things, you know Paul
32:25
threw me the pass, we had great defense, I
32:29
just caught the pass.
32:30
You caught the key pass.
32:31
I did, but our defense played great, kept them out of their zone…anyway.
32:38
That was the very first time that I started to feel some
32:44
acceptance on this campus.
32:46
From
32:51
there, I went on to become Joe College.
32:59
Tell is about that, it’s an interesting story.
33:01
The guys in my house put my name in as a joke.
33:04
They were messing with me.
33:18
They would dare at night you know, they would really crack up and tell me.
33:27
Hey Durden, how are you coming along in that contest, the Joe College contest?
33:31
I said, ok you guys will get yours one of these days.
33:36
They were just laughing and just hooraying, and then on Wednesday
33:38
night when the house mother wasn’t there, they would get up and
33:41
they would say, oh, Joe College.
33:47
It went on, it started off with sixty-four houses and got down to
33:52
thirty and my name was still there.
33:52
The teasing started to subside a little bit.
33:52
It got down to
34:10
sixteen, then they started talking and thinking maybe
34:15
our house can win this thing.
34:17
So they all got behind me and started going and campaigning
34:20
and doing all these things.
34:23
To make a long story short, I was selected that year as Joe College.
34:27
Joe College represented the typical sophomore who had good grades, popular
34:33
on campus, and this kind of thing.
34:39
That was a milestone during the time I was here at Oregon State.
34:46
On the girls side it was Betty Collegiate and Joe College,
34:51
and I really enjoyed that.
34:56
The pictures in the year book…
34:59
We didn’t find it, but we’ll go and find it.
35:02
You then had a big dance.
35:04
We had a big dance at Gill Coliseum, and this dance was the last three guys, they
35:11
would announce who the Joe College was and who the Betty Collegiate was that night.
35:19
We had a big turnout, all of the student body was in there, and
35:24
they announced who the Joe College, three guys…I don’t remember the
35:32
guys…then I was chosen.
35:33
I was Joe College!
35:35
So, Joe College and Betty Collegiate had to lead off the dance.
35:39
So, I forget the girls name, so we led off the dance and that kind of thing
35:45
which was a big thing in those days.
35:50
Coming back to those days, would there be any sort of segregation that was
35:53
going on in the town of Corvallis, if you want to talk about that, or on campus?
35:57
You know,
36:00
I learned something during those years.
36:02
Like I said, I came here as an eighteen year old adolescent, and when I left
36:07
here I was a twenty-two year old man.
36:10
I learned so much, and I learned that everything that happened
36:15
to me wasn’t all racial.
36:18
A lot of things people just didn’t know, but there was some racial situations.
36:23
There was no question about that.
36:27
I remember
36:31
Chuck telling me about this one situation our town doctor was the team doctor and
36:41
so whenever a player had to see the doctor he had to go
36:44
downtown to the doctor’s office.
36:46
Chuck Marshall was sitting in the doctor’s office one day, he’s sitting
36:50
there reading this magazine, and this little boy is sitting right next to him.
36:56
Chuck sees the little boy and said that he put the magazine up, and the little boy
37:05
pushed the magazine down and he took a good look at Chuck, and
37:11
Chuck put the magazine back up.
37:16
The little boy pushed the magazine down again and he was looking at him, and he
37:22
said, momma, why do you make me wash my face and he doesn’t have to wash his face?
37:28
[Laughter]
37:31
Chuck came back and told me that story, we laughed about that.
37:36
It was because people had never, you know,
37:41
they had never been in that environment, and I had never been in that environment,
37:45
so the two clashed and it was a matter of getting to know each other.
37:53
Chuck says, he was so embarrassed, the doctor’s office was full
37:57
of people, and kids, you know, have got one tone and that’s
38:05
loud.
38:05
He came back and he was telling me about that story, and I tell
38:07
you what, we laughed about that.
38:11
There was entertainment –wise, on this campus during the years I was
38:16
here was non-existent for black guys.
38:20
We made up our own things to do.
38:24
There was one black family living in Corvallis, his name was Bud, and Bud
38:29
had a wife and two kids and we would go over to Bud’s house on Friday nights
38:34
and Saturday nights and we’d play cards and talk and all kinds of stuff.
38:40
He was always interested in bringing us up to date.
38:43
There’s one thing
38:46
I remember very vividly, one reason I believe that the university at that
38:51
time was very cognize of and didn’t want any racial things to break out.
38:58
We had in the city of Portland the Assistant District
39:04
Attorney was a black guy.
39:06
I don’t remember his name, I don’t remember anything about it, I never
39:09
talked to him, but some of the other guys did and I would see him driving
39:12
around the campus from time to time.
39:16
Nobody wanted this guy to get a hold to anything that he
39:19
didn’t have to get a hold to.
39:21
So, the administration, the Dean of Women and the Dean of Men, just never…I remember
39:35
the priest or the minister from one of the churches coming down and talking
39:40
to some of the girls, they never talked to us, they never said anything to us,
39:45
they didn’t want this thing to get blown out of proportion, any of this stuff.
39:50
We always got a second hand, that girls always came back
39:53
and told us what they said.
39:55
We always knew what was going on.
39:58
Anyway,
40:02
the majority of the time I was here, the activities for…the fraternities
40:08
and sororities would have their get-togethers and parties and have
40:13
their luaus and we didn’t have, we made our own entertainment.
40:19
There was nothing here for black athletes to
40:24
do.
40:24
I know that that’s changed, there’s so many on the campus.
40:28
Those were the days that
40:34
things were not as they probably should have been, but we made do.
40:41
You had spoken to me a little about the Paul Lowe bike incident and
40:43
I wanted you to talk about that.
40:46
You know we used to come back to school,
40:52
two or three weeks before the student body got here…
40:55
To practice?
40:56
For fall practice.
40:59
Boy they were some tough, tough days.
41:03
They were two-a-days.
41:04
Practice in the morning, at night, practice in the afternoon.
41:07
Boy, you’re talking about people that were beaten.
41:10
Those football players, we were just all beat.
41:16
This particular day, as I came out of the coliseum, Gill Coliseum
41:22
where we dressed, there was always this bicycle lying on the grass.
41:29
I was too tired to ride it or I would have…
41:32
Ridden it yourself?
41:32
Yeah, but I was too tired to pump.
41:36
I walked back to the dorm.
41:38
But there were guys taking that bicycle, riding it all around and nobody knew whose
41:42
bicycle it was, but they would bring it back and lay it on the grass and another
41:46
guy would take it and he would ride it.
41:48
This one particular day, after practice, everybody else was tired and they went
41:55
back to their rooms and flopped on their beds, and Paul Lowe goes downtown to
41:59
see this girl who worked at a restaurant down there, and he takes the bicycle.
42:07
The police arrested him for stealing the bike.
42:12
The little boy’s father,
42:17
Tommy Prothro explained to this guy what had happened, and that this bike
42:23
was just lying there and all of the players used it and it was just this
42:27
one time that Paul was caught on it.
42:30
The thing that disappointed me the most
42:34
is the guy would not drop the charges, he chose to press charges against Paul, so
42:42
Prothro had to go out and get a lawyer to defend Paul and this became national news.
42:48
It was in every newspaper, and I was getting calls from L.A. What
42:51
the hell’s going on up there?
42:55
I said, nothing.
42:58
Paul rode a bike that we all ride and the press just blew it out… you know.
43:07
I had a friend that was at Arizona State University and he called to
43:12
ask me, we heard that Paul Lowe is in trouble up there with the
43:16
law stealing someone’s bicycle.
43:21
That’s what they didn’t want to happen on the racial front.
43:27
Eventually, Paul was cleared, but
43:31
I don’t know who the man was, I had no idea, and I’m a second hand guy looking
43:36
in at this stuff from afar and I never discussed it with Paul, I don’t know
43:41
what happened, I just know eventually he was no longer charged with the theft.
43:47
I know that Coach Prothro had to go to Portland to get an attorney to defend
43:51
him, and I thought that was tremendously unnecessary, especially because of all the
43:56
things Paul had done for this community.
43:57
Here’s a guy that’s going to stick this thing to him, I thought
44:02
that was tremendously unfair.
44:04
Anyway, that happened.
44:08
Paul was way ahead of his time in terms of, during the years I was here, no
44:17
black was allowed to play basketball.
44:22
So, Paul takes a basketball and he goes out there and he’s dribbling on the
44:26
court, and four or five of us sitting up in the bleachers watching Paul
44:30
seeing what the hell he was going to do.
44:32
He’s bouncing the ball down there, and Slats there with his whistle and all
44:36
these players come over on the other side and Paul was running around down there.
44:43
Paul was a CIF player, he was a hell of a good player.
44:49
He would shoot from the court, swoosh,
44:54
and I thought to myself, I wonder if Gill is up
45:00
[?] I wonder if he’s seeing this.
45:01
You know we’re sitting up in the stands and here Paul is swishing them.
45:10
He would dribble around down there and Gill was over here and he would
45:15
dribble the ball by him up on there.
45:19
Oh man, this guy is insane.
45:23
Paul had no fear of anybody, he was much like Dave Mann.
45:28
Tell me about him.
45:29
He had no fear of anybody and circumstances.
45:33
Pretty
45:38
soon, I guess he realized he was being completely ignored,
45:45
he went in and got dressed and we all walked home together
45:49
talking about the experience.
45:50
The
45:55
funny thing about it was no blacks were allowed to play basketball, but
46:00
Mexicans were, Latinos on the team.
46:06
It was only against blacks.
46:12
It was after I had graduated and I was, I don’t know when Valenti took
46:17
over, but that was the end of the color thing in terms of basketball here.
46:24
They had some great basketball players: Dave Ganby, the Swede, they had those guys
46:28
here, they never won anything, never won the championship or anything like that.
46:36
I don’t know why Slats took that position, I have no idea.
46:45
I never talked to Slats, I would see him and that was it.
46:49
I never talked to him and he never talked to me
46:54
before he passed away.
46:55
That was it.
46:59
Can you come back and talk a little bit about, I know you never met
47:02
Dave Mann, but can you tell us…
47:05
Dave Mann had a reputation, and when I got here in ’55 I guess he was just leaving.
47:09
I thought he was here earlier than that, he was here in ’51 and ’55, I came in in
47:16
’55 and I guess he was leaving in ’55.
47:19
Dave Mann was an awesome player
47:24
and he was much like Paul, he had no fear of anything or anybody.
47:31
And they would tell me Dave would catch the quarterback in the huddle and
47:36
pull him toward him, and tell him, I want that damn ball, give me the ball.
47:45
He got the ball.
47:46
[Laughter]
47:49
That’s the kind of guy Dave
47:54
was, when the game got tight, he put the team on his back.
47:59
A lot of times he didn’t win it, but boy he gave it his all.
48:04
He
48:12
didn’t always win, but Dave Mann was that kind of player, and he was a tough dude.
48:18
That was a legacy of Dave Mann that I encountered when I got here.
48:25
There was one other thing that I remember, there was also a
48:30
black, student body president.
48:33
Really?
48:35
I don’t remember this guy’s name, but I remember there was a lot of
48:40
conversation on campus about this guy.
48:45
He got caught up in some faculty scandals, some faculty members embraced
48:53
him and he became known as a Communist.
49:04
Later, driven from the campus, but I never heard anything about the professors
49:08
being driven from the campus, just him.
49:10
Interesting.
49:11
This would be about what year roughly?
49:13
This would be
49:17
in the late ‘49s
49:20
‘50s.
49:20
Ok, we’ll check on that.
49:23
I mean because we didn’t know this person even existed.
49:25
He was a student body president, here on this campus.
49:34
I don’t know his name, I’ve never seen him, but that was the talk.
49:41
Did you know about him?
49:43
Who?
49:45
He was student body president here, you don’t know him?
49:48
I don’t know everybody!
49:52
No I didn’t know him.
49:54
Oh man, let me tell you about this guy.
49:57
He was a brave person, and he had to be real smart to become the student body
50:03
president, he was doing very well, until he got caught up with some professors that
50:08
were communist and they took a hold of him and started guiding him in the wrong
50:12
direction and he was branded a communist.
50:17
This might have been later than the ‘50s, I don’t know.
50:23
But they ran him out of here because he was a communist.
50:25
I
50:32
know you and June had been going out long distance.
50:34
Can you tell us about your relationship with June?
50:36
I met my wife in high school, she was a junior I was a senior.
50:42
She never really knew anything about football, but I was good, I liked that.
50:50
I realized that she was dating me not because I was a football player,
50:55
and we dated a few times in high school.
50:59
Then I went away to college and we would write.
51:04
I think once or twice she came up here to see the campus, but it was just an
51:11
off and on type of thing, we were never really that serious until I graduated,
51:17
and after I graduated we married,
51:22
and I started my teaching and coaching career.
51:30
I met Ted in high school, met my wife in high school.
51:36
One thing I’d want to leave with you is that my mom said to me,
51:41
I don’t know what to tell you in terms of where to go to school,
51:49
I’m going to pray for you—my mother’s religious—I’m going to
51:54
ask the Lord to guide you and that you make the right decision.
51:57
I feel I made the right decision, I feel that when I came to Oregon State, I went
52:04
through some things, but I made the right decision, this was the school for me.
52:10
Can you talk a little bit now, as we are coming to the end of this,
52:14
about your last year, the last two years you were here because that
52:17
was the Rose Bowl year and then…
52:19
The Rose Bowl year was the ’57 year, I was here from ’58 and ’59…
52:24
So you had two more years to go?
52:26
Yeah.
52:27
During my senior year I was doing my student teaching, and once again,
52:34
I don’t know whether they were trying to protect me, I don’t
52:38
know what happened, but they sent me to Portland to do my student
52:41
teaching, everybody else was student teaching around in Albany [Laughter]
52:47
. Wow, I drove all the way to Portland and they had a professor come out to me,
52:57
he came out to evaluate and check on my stuff, and I did my student
53:00
teaching at Jefferson High School.
53:02
Mel Renfro was one of the senior high school players at that time,
53:08
went on to became a great all-pro football player with the Dallas
53:10
Cowboys, and his brother was there.
53:17
So after I did my student teaching I came back here and my parents drove up and
53:25
I graduated, then I left and went home.
53:29
That was a short version of my senior, but there was something
53:32
else in my senior year.
53:38
Did you know that…I don’t know whether it was my major, but I
53:43
believe it was everybody at that time, had to take a swimming test in
53:47
order to graduate from Oregon State.
53:49
Look that up because every Saturday I went out and I was swimming
53:54
and I had to swim the length of the pool and I had go down and…
53:58
Pick up something?
53:59
Pick up a big 30lb weight and bring it to the top, and
54:06
the swim on my side.
54:06
I understand that a couple, three years, soon after I left they knocked
54:11
that out because there were guys that were graduating in forestry and guys
54:14
graduating as an engineer couldn’t swim a lick, they couldn’t get their degree.
54:19
[Laughter]
54:19
Are you serious?
54:19
I’ll definitely have to look into that
54:22
one.
54:23
That was a lot of fun, we had some things going here at Oregon State in those days.
54:27
When
54:31
I left here I left knowing a lot of people,
54:36
people that to this day I still stay in touch with.
54:42
In fact I had a call from Dick Cory’s daughter when he passed
54:46
away, she called to let me know that he had passed, otherwise I
54:52
don’t think I would have known.
54:54
Then a good friend of mine who I visit often, Sterling Hammack, he played
54:59
behind me, he was ahead of me class-wise,
55:03
he passed away, prostate cancer.
55:06
Sterling and Nub Beamer.
55:10
Sterling
55:13
was the only child in his family and his mom and dad were so proud of him,
55:19
and he was my roommate on the road.
55:23
His mom would come and she would make us this big basket of cookies,
55:28
and boy, we would just tear into those cookies every night.
55:35
He flunked out of school with three weeks to go.
55:37
Oh my gosh, really?
55:39
Wow.
55:40
Nub Beamer, his senior year, the last game we played he
55:47
checked out of school.
55:49
Nub went on to play in Canada, became a very wealthy man.
55:53
I
55:56
saw Nub the last time I was here, four years ago, with the reunion of the team.
56:01
What a nice, polite, quiet guy, but just would bust your butt on the football
56:10
team.
56:10
[Laughter] . He was a tank, he was that wide.
56:15
Those two guys I remember because they were the only guys that … I’ve
56:20
never seen a guy play his last game and drops out of school.
56:25
You know, he goes to Canada and Sam Wesley went to Canada.
56:29
When he declared ineligible he was a junior here, he went to Canada,
56:33
made the team, and came back and paid his way through Oregon State.
56:37
So he played his seasons, then came back to take school?
56:37
With the money that he earned playing professional football, in Canada, he
56:38
paid his way through Oregon State.
56:48
He graduated, I think he moved to San Jose or Fresno, one of
56:52
those communities up there.
56:54
I understand that he passed away here not too long ago.
56:58
Those guys in my era…
57:00
There are fewer and fewer guys, absolutely.
57:04
Of course Amos Marsh passed away.
57:08
The story with him was quite tragic.
57:10
I never knew what happened to Chuck Marshall.
57:14
Billy Parrott was on our team, Billy was not an athlete.
57:17
Billy was out of the Air Force, and he was 25 or 26 years old and I think he
57:26
was just wanting to do something…then he wanted to become a professional student.
57:30
Five years after I left Oregon State, he was still here.
57:34
He had a brilliant mind.
57:36
So one day, he made some mistakes and sent a resume and some work he
57:41
had done to some firm in New York and they hired him right off the bat.
57:48
He wanted to stay and be
57:53
this professional student, and he took the job there and I lost
57:56
contact with him all together, I don’t know whatever happened to him.
58:00
Another guy who was here was Victor Hall.
58:06
His name will never show up in the books.
58:08
Victor came here as a freshman, a great athlete, he was the guy that
58:15
was projected to win—we used to call it in those days 440, now it’s 400
58:21
meters—for the United States Olympics.
58:24
Wow, he was that fast?
58:25
He used to race quarter horses.
58:28
Victor came here and he was going to play football.
58:31
Victor flunked out,
58:35
went back to California and the next year he enrolled in Cal Poly.
58:44
He was in that plane crash that killed all those players.
58:49
My wife and I, she was still my girlfriend at that time, were at a party one night
58:56
and they announced this plane had crashed.
58:58
They said, we will start giving names as we notify next kin.
59:08
His name was among the first five that they gave.
59:10
Wow, what a tragedy.
59:12
So we left the party and went to his home.
59:15
I shouldn’t have gone there because his mother was crying, and she said,
59:18
why didn’t he stay up there with you?
59:20
She didn’t realize he had flunked out.
59:24
What can I say?
59:25
I left because I just felt so bad for her.
59:33
Can I get you to now talk a little bit about your, leaving
59:36
Oregon State University; I know your knee had gotten injured.
59:39
Yeah, I had reconstruction knee surgery and had every intentions
59:46
of going into playing pro football.
59:49
The two teams that were after me most of all was the Green
59:54
Bay Packers under Lombardi, and Saskatchewan Roughriders immediately.
1:00:01
Those two teams came after me very hard, and I said, look I can’t run, I’ve got
1:00:09
this knee that’s all screwed up here.
1:00:12
Of course surgery in those days is not like it is…you
1:00:16
know…this is a far cry from where
1:00:23
it was then.
1:00:24
I said, I’m going to maybe show up as a free agent or something for one of
1:00:31
these teams once my knee is strong and in those days there was only fourteen teams.
1:00:39
I got married and I started teaching school, and then my wife was pregnant.
1:00:47
And then I said, oh shit, if I leave my job to go try to make one of these
1:00:54
teams and I don’t make it, I got more than myself to think about here.
1:01:00
I said, I’m not going to do it, so I didn’t play pro football because of that.
1:01:07
I looked at the guys who I played with, Amos Marsh played behind me and he went
1:01:13
on to be a big star on the Dallas Cowboys.
1:01:16
For a long time, it took me a while to get over
1:01:22
it.
1:01:24
Then I became a coach,
1:01:29
went over to Compton high school and I taught school there and I coached.
1:01:38
I was there for a few years, I’m not sure how many, four or five,
1:01:42
and then I went over to the junior college, I became the coach.
1:01:46
I was an instructor there teaching class in community disease, and I left there.
1:01:54
People over at Long Beach State University were interested in me coming there, so
1:02:00
I went there and I became a coach, and I also taught classes in physical education.
1:02:06
During all of this you were actually the first African American
1:02:09
coaches at all of these places.
1:02:10
I was the first African American P.E. teacher at Compton, very first one.
1:02:17
Then I went to Compton Junior College and I was the second African
1:02:20
American to coach at Compton.
1:02:22
I was the first African American to coach at long beach.
1:02:24
The first African American to coach at UCLA.
1:02:25
The first African American to coach with the Rams.
1:02:25
The first African American coach to coach with the Houston Oilers, and
1:02:28
the second African American to coach
1:02:38
with the Chargers.
1:02:40
Lamar Lundy was the first.
1:02:46
I went through a lot of firsts.
1:02:47
Yes you did.
1:02:49
That means a lot of problems.
1:02:53
Just in general.
1:02:55
I enjoyed my time when I was at the high school.
1:02:57
I
1:03:00
coached the football team there.
1:03:06
We had some great experiences there, learned a lot under the coach who was
1:03:14
the head coach, he was a guy by the name of McCutcheon, learned a lot from him.
1:03:19
I went on to the junior college and that was two years at the
1:03:27
junior college—probably one of the best jobs I’ve ever had.
1:03:33
I can understand why these guys wind up at the junior college and they never leave.
1:03:36
I
1:03:38
taught a class in
1:03:42
commutable diseases there.
1:03:46
The people at Long Beach State came after me, so I went to Long Beach State
1:03:50
as a key instructor and also as a coach, and I regret to say, it was probably
1:03:58
one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had.
1:04:04
I was the defensive back coach at Long Beach State, and I was only there
1:04:09
for a year because during the time that I was at the junior college,
1:04:15
the last year I was there, I had signed to go to Long Beach and I went to a seminar
1:04:23
that, of course, Prothro was giving.
1:04:26
Coach Prothro, at the end of the seminar, Coach Prothro
1:04:29
said, oh you got a few minutes?
1:04:31
I want to talk to you for a second.
1:04:33
So I said, yeah, heck yeah.
1:04:36
We went to a little coffee shop around the corner, we were sitting there talking
1:04:40
and that’s when he asked me, I’d like to have you on my staff, is that possible?
1:04:47
Yeah, it’s possible, but I had already signed to go to Long Beach State.
1:04:55
I said, coach, can I join you at semester break?
1:05:00
He said, yes.
1:05:02
So, I went back to school.
1:05:05
During the football…during one year I was there in the football program,
1:05:11
I coached the defensive-backs, they didn’t know that I was
1:05:18
leaving.
1:05:18
The coaching staff didn’t know.
1:05:20
Fred Miller, who was the athletic director, he knew, and he tried
1:05:26
to talk me out of leaving.
1:05:27
He said, you stay here, you’re an assistant professor here now, you
1:05:30
stay here and in a few years you’ll be an associate professor and work
1:05:34
yourself into full professorship.
1:05:40
The coaching staff…I coached the defensive-backs on that
1:05:47
team…I never saw one game
1:05:52
because they always had me on the road recruiting
1:05:56
the team that were going to play, and they were never interested in what I told them.
1:06:04
This was to say that we’ve got a black on the staff,
1:06:12
so I wasn’t going to stay there anyway.
1:06:16
The thing was, I went to UCLA,
1:06:22
I stayed at UCLA for three or four years, then I went to the Rams.
1:06:26
The same coaches that didn’t allow me to see the games or anything then came
1:06:33
to me and said, hey, look can I send this guy over, would you look at him?
1:06:40
Interesting,
1:06:42
that’s frustrating.
1:06:45
You know, it was probably the worst job that I had, the Long Beach State thing.
1:06:51
Then UCLA was a fine place to work.
1:06:54
Along with Compton College, I could have stayed there all my…it was a fine
1:07:00
place to work, I enjoyed that the most.
1:07:05
We had great teams in those years.
1:07:09
We tied one game against Stanford and lost to SC or we’d have gone to the
1:07:15
Rose Bowl, the last year I was there.
1:07:19
We came up here, we beat Oregon State.
1:07:25
Those were the years and Tommy was a great guy to work for.
1:07:30
Tommy, I’ll tell you a little bit about Tommy.
1:07:33
Tommy was an aristocratic southerner.
1:07:36
He
1:07:41
didn’t waste his time with a lot of people--white, black,
1:07:45
Mexicans, whatever--because he was always taught growing up
1:07:49
that he was beyond those people.
1:07:51
Interesting.
1:07:57
I had one coach tell me once and I just looked at him because Coach
1:08:02
Prothro never came at me like that.
1:08:05
This man was the closest man, he could have been my second father,
1:08:11
that’s the way I looked at him and that’s the way he treated me.
1:08:16
I had one coach, head coach and I won’t call his name, who told me one day,
1:08:23
Tommy Prothro is the most prejudice man I’ve ever seen.
1:08:27
He said this to me.
1:08:29
I never said a word to him, I just looked at him and walked away because
1:08:33
that wasn’t the way he came off to me.
1:08:35
I could only speak for what I felt.
1:08:43
When I started to work for Coach
1:08:47
Prothro, he came across as…we used to sit and talk about some of the experiences
1:08:54
I had here at Oregon State and he would enlighten me on some things I didn’t
1:08:58
know was a student athlete, but I found out in my conversation with him how
1:09:04
do these things really work together.
1:09:08
As for the coaching part of it, the man was a master.
1:09:13
He will never, never get the credit that he brought to this profession.
1:09:21
For example, now these quarterbacks wear these ear pieces in the helmet, Prothro
1:09:27
came out with that in the early ‘60s when I was there, late ‘60s, ’68, ’69
1:09:34
with Gary Beman, but it was against the rules because we
1:09:39
never used it out on the field.
1:09:41
We experimented with it.
1:09:42
Ah, you did, in practice.
1:09:43
We were never to tell because the NCAA didn’t want…he was a brilliant man.
1:09:52
He came out with, you know how the quarter backs throw the ball
1:09:56
into the ground to ground it now?
1:10:00
In those days you threw the ball out of bounds, when the clock was stopped.
1:10:04
Prothro
1:10:06
came out and put this in the national football league.
1:10:10
We were playing, Roman Gabriel was our quarterback, it was getting close to the
1:10:15
game ending and we hadn’t scored to win.
1:10:18
Roman dropped back, boom, because we had taught him to do it all week.
1:10:22
The referees blow their whistles and their flags came out, that’s
1:10:26
not in the rules you can’t do that.
1:10:28
Prothro was saying, yeah, we can, we’ve contacted the legal office and they said
1:10:32
it was a legitimate thing that we can do.
1:10:35
They said, no you can’t.
1:10:37
Gabriel takes the ball, boom, stops the clock again, they throw more flags.
1:10:43
Monday he gets a call, the league says, you are absolutely right.
1:10:48
Ok, right.
1:10:50
And from that day on all of the professional football teams, and all the
1:10:54
teams in this country started to do that.
1:10:56
He started that.
1:11:00
There were so many other things that Prothro did.
1:11:03
It was amazing, just amazing.
1:11:05
I remember when the paper used to call him aloof, saying
1:11:10
you’re aloof from your players.
1:11:13
I used to talk to him about it and say, coach, they’re
1:11:16
calling you aloof, why is that?
1:11:18
He said, well maybe I am.
1:11:21
He said, I’ve got to make decisions to cut this guy, to cut this guy,
1:11:28
keep this guy on the board, and he says, I don’t want my personal
1:11:32
feelings to get involved with that.
1:11:36
So, I don’t get to be buddy-buddy with a player.
1:11:41
I keep a player a player and I can do my job there without feeling any remorse.
1:11:48
To me that makes sense.
1:11:49
Yes, it sure does.
1:11:51
There
1:11:54
were all kinds of little things like this that we got to talk as I became one of
1:12:01
his assistants that he felt comfortable sitting down and talking to me about.
1:12:06
I really do feel that I was one of the last coaches to
1:12:12
talk to him before he died.
1:12:13
We gave a big ol’ appreciation, award dinner down in Memphis, Tennessee for him.
1:12:22
This was in the summer of
1:12:27
’95.
1:12:32
We were down there for that shindig, my plane was going to
1:12:37
leave that afternoon at 3 o’clock.
1:12:40
Shirley picked me up at the airport, I left my hotel room at 9 o’clock and she
1:12:44
drove me to their apartment the coach and I sat and talked for all that time.
1:12:52
People didn’t realize it but Coach Prothro was a very wealthy man.
1:12:55
Oh, I didn’t know that.
1:12:56
He was very wealthy.
1:12:57
His father,
1:13:00
either owned or was one of the original managers of the Boston Red Sox.
1:13:04
They
1:13:07
called him Doc Prothro.
1:13:13
He told me, you know—at this time he was severely afflicted by prostate cancer.
1:13:21
He said, you know, I’ve been to every doctor in this world,
1:13:27
none of them, with all the riches that I have, none of
1:13:31
them can get rid of this cancer.
1:13:35
He was talking about himself like that, you know, he went
1:13:42
on talking about himself.
1:13:45
Then I remember
1:13:49
both of them drove me to the airport when it was time for me to
1:13:51
leave, and we said our good-byes.
1:13:56
At that time I owned an automobile dealership in
1:13:58
Hayward, a Chevrolet dealership.
1:14:02
Later on I called it Durden Chevrolet, I changed the name
1:14:04
Hayward to Durden Chevrolet.
1:14:06
I somehow went to
1:14:13
the store, we
1:14:16
would call them dealership stores.
1:14:19
Anyway, I was on my way to the dealership and I had the radio going and they broke
1:14:24
in, and said Tommy Prothro had passed that night, this was either the late
1:14:32
part of January or the first of February.
1:14:34
In ’96.
1:14:35
I said, oh man, did
1:14:41
I hear that?
1:14:42
So when I got to the office I called Shirley.
1:14:45
Shirley said, yes, he passed that night.
1:14:51
So that was it.
1:14:54
He also told me this, he said, he’d left Oregon State a lot of
1:15:01
money, I won’t discuss the amount.
1:15:09
He says, when I pass, this money will automatically go to Oregon State,
1:15:15
but until she dies, Shirley will get the residuals of this money, and when
1:15:21
she dies, all of it goes to Oregon State, a very substantial amount.
1:15:26
Even though he was at
1:15:30
UCLA and coached UCLA, he never left Oregon State.
1:15:36
That was his baby.
1:15:46
I got my masters from Long Beach State, but I never left here either.
1:15:50
That’s very true, very true.
1:15:51
So
1:15:54
I looked back on what my mother said, I made the right decision I think.
1:16:00
I
1:16:02
made a lot of friends, people that I’m still in contact with, white
1:16:08
people, black people, it didn’t make any difference, a lot of friends
1:16:12
and people I still care about.
1:16:14
I was going to
1:16:17
say, as we end of this interview, I was going to say, would you mind
1:16:19
saying something about your sons?
1:16:20
I know they were quite successful.
1:16:22
I
1:16:26
was getting ready to get out of coaching because my sons were getting at the
1:16:31
age where we wanted to settle down so that they would have some stability.
1:16:35
My
1:16:38
oldest son
1:16:42
went on
1:16:44
to play basketball.
1:16:45
The first year in his high school career he never played
1:16:48
football, he was a basketball
1:16:52
player.
1:16:53
His junior year the coaches were constantly after me, so his
1:16:58
junior year he decided to play.
1:17:02
Boy did he stir up things.
1:17:03
My oldest son was a real athlete, he had talent, he was big, he
1:17:10
was 6’1”, 6’2” and he could run.
1:17:13
The four years that he was at Helix High School, he was the only athlete
1:17:18
that—Bill Walden went to the same high school—my son is the only athlete that
1:17:22
ever scored four years, as a freshman on a [pro?] varsity basketball.
1:17:28
Oh ok, interesting, wow.
1:17:32
I don’t know, maybe Bill didn’t play when he was a freshman, I don’t know.
1:17:36
But your son did?
1:17:38
Yeah, he never was defeated in the quarter mile his whole career in high school.
1:17:46
When UCLA came the thing that bothered me a lot was Oregon State never recruited.
1:17:54
It’s a shame.
1:17:54
What in the hell is going on?
1:17:57
Never tried.
1:17:58
They never came by, anything.
1:18:02
All of the other schools: Washington, SC,
1:18:07
and
1:18:09
UCLA, Colorado, a lot of the big 12 teams.
1:18:14
He really wanted to go to Colorado, I mean they came after him hard, but he wound up
1:18:22
at UCLA.
1:18:23
He was on that team that beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
1:18:29
My youngest son, he played—I knew Bill Walsh very well—so he said, Earnel,
1:18:35
I’m going to take him as a safety.
1:18:38
So
1:18:40
he went to the 49ers.
1:18:44
My youngest son was drafted by them—he turned out to be Walter Camp All-American
1:18:49
at the University of Arizona—and he was drafted by the Detroit Lions.
1:18:56
After a few years they traded him to San Diego Chargers.
1:19:00
That’s where he was injured and decided he didn’t want to play
1:19:04
anymore, so he didn’t play anymore.
1:19:06
So my middle son never [Laughter] he didn’t last [that was?] in college.
1:19:14
My sons turned out to be pretty good athletes, all of them.
1:19:18
All ran track, all played football,
1:19:23
so I was very proud of them, and every chance I got, I tried to steal
1:19:31
some time to go watch them perform.
1:19:34
That’s that.
1:19:39
