00:01
So, our names are Buddy Terry and Reilly Quinn.
00:04
We are students at Oregon State University’s U-Engage class, “Untold
00:07
Stories of People of Color in Oregon.” Today's date is October 29th,
00:15
2014, and we are conducting an oral history interview with Juan Trujillo.
00:22
Okay, so we'll start out with some, kind of, personal-level
00:25
questions, just general information.
00:29
Please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:31
Okay.
00:31
I'm Juan Antonio Trujillo, and I’ll spell the whole thing in order, as is.
00:36
Last name first?
00:37
I don't know how you want it.
00:38
J-U-A-N.
00:40
Antonio, do I have to spell that part too?
00:41
You can figure it out, A-N--I don't ever spell my name.
00:45
A-N-T-O-N-I-O.
00:47
Last name: T-RU-J-I-L-LO.
00:51
That said, most people just call me “Tony”.
00:54
Excellent.
00:55
thank you.
00:57
What is your birthday and birthplace?
00:59
October 7th, 1964, and I was born in Tacoma, Washington.
01:03
Great.
01:05
With which ethnic or cultural background do you identify?
01:08
Uh, okay well, that's a good question actually because it's something that
01:12
I think shifts over people’s lifetime.
01:14
Right now, I think my strongest cultural, ethnic identity would be Chicano.
01:19
Okay, and when and where were your parents born and what are their backgrounds?
01:25
Okay.
01:25
My mom was born in Canada, so I'm actually second generation, and it's because
01:30
of the English-speaking Canadian part.
01:34
Her family moved to Washington just after World War II when she was just
01:40
about high school age, I think she was about 14 when she came here.
01:43
My dad's side of the family, on the other hand, has been here for about 400 years.
01:48
And my dad was born in a small town fairly close to Taos, New Mexico,
01:52
where most of my relatives still live.
01:57
And where did you mainly grow up?
02:00
I grew up in Tacoma, yeah.
02:04
And what was your transition from high school to college like?
02:09
My transition from high school to college was rapid.
02:12
I've graduated from high school at the age of 17, and within two weeks, I was
02:19
all settled into my dorm at college.
02:22
I went to BYU for my undergraduate.
02:25
So I was really anxious to get away from home.
02:27
I was—I really never went back after that.
02:31
So I was 17 and didn’t really spend much time at home after that.
02:35
And your work was done in Texas?
02:39
Well my PhD was in Texas.
02:40
And so,
02:43
yeah, I mean, I guess I never thought of that as much of a transition,
02:45
but it was an important one.
02:47
I was at BYU for a long time, so I did not only my undergraduate there but I
02:51
got my master's degree from BYU as well.
02:53
So in 1990, there were a lot of connections between the BYU
02:59
language department and the Spanish program at University of Texas.
03:03
One of my mentors, professors, at BYU had gone through that program
03:07
himself many, many years before, and so there was a bit of a pipeline that
03:10
kind of funneled students from BYU to the University of Texas, and I was
03:16
just yet another one in the pipeline.
03:18
I don't know that there were that many after me; it was sort
03:20
of slowing down after that.
03:24
And, you answered that.
03:28
Who are your mentors mainly?
03:30
You said your professor you just mentioned.
03:31
Yeah, and I guess, let's see.
03:34
There are kind of mentors that you have assigned to you and then there
03:36
are mentors that you just, sort of, end up informally interacting
03:41
with for one reason or another.
03:44
So yeah, I guess I did mention that my mentor, I guess, during my
03:47
undergraduate and master's programs was a professor in the Spanish program.
03:52
And Hal Clegg was his name.
03:56
It’s interesting because his own son, actually, has followed in his footsteps,
03:59
as well, and is doing the exact same kinds of academic papers that his father was
04:03
doing back when I was a student at BYU.
04:08
I don't think that he's someone I would really consider a mentor anymore, he was
04:11
important as a professional mentor and, I think, in other ways as well, at the time.
04:14
But, you know, your life ends up sometimes going in different
04:17
directions, and I haven't had a chance to really talk with him recently,
04:22
meaning in the last 15 years.
04:25
But, I suspect it would be a really difficult conversation.
04:28
And,
04:31
I was saying that you end up with sort of assigned mentors too.
04:33
So when I was at the University of Texas, I had a dissertation advisor who,
04:38
I think, filled sort of the same role that the other guy at BYU had before.
04:43
He was a student who had been at BYU himself, he was part of this pipeline; he
04:48
took a little different route because his
04:52
Ph.D. wasn't from the University of Texas.
04:54
He ended up there as a faculty member he’d actually gone to Berkley.
04:57
But, everybody knew everybody.
04:58
It's kind of a small world, and so there are a lot of people who do Hispanic
05:02
linguistics who have connections with BYU.
05:07
So he was someone I would have thought of as a mentor, at least during my Texas
05:11
years, mostly in an academic sense.
05:14
But there are a lot of social challenges in graduate school, as well.
05:19
And, I think that he really did his best to make himself available and help smooth
05:23
over some of the difficulties that you end up having with other professors,
05:27
or a lot of ego, and a lot of stuff goes on in those programs, politically,
05:33
that he helped me work through.
05:36
Is there anyone on campus right now you would consider to be a mentor?
05:42
I really can't think of anybody that I’d
05:47
think of as a mentor right now on campus, no.
05:51
And so, the following questions will be about your position working on campus.
05:55
Okay.
05:58
Why did you decide OSU?
06:02
I decided OSU really based on how close it was to my family and, just,
06:09
the landscape that I'm used to.
06:11
This is like--like I said I grew up in Tacoma, so having a chance to
06:15
get back in the Pacific Northwest was really a great opportunity.
06:18
Most of the time when you get an advanced degree and go on the academic
06:22
job market, you really have no say over what part of the country you end up in.
06:28
We're all super hyper specialized and there aren't very many positions
06:32
available for the kinds of training that we get in graduate school.
06:37
So I really considered myself fortunate that there was a position
06:40
that lined up with my training in a part of the country that I like being
06:45
in that kind of feels like home.
06:46
Sure.
06:50
What were your first impressions of the University and the
06:55
community?
06:55
Well like I said, I’d been away from the northwest for a while, and so, having
06:58
a chance to visit the campus the first time, it felt a lot like coming home.
07:03
It was a climate that I was used to.
07:05
People were making all sorts of excuses for what I was experiencing weather-wise
07:10
while I was here, it’s like, this if fine, I got it, you know, it’s not a problem.
07:15
I liked being back here in the cold, damp weather after being in Texas where
07:19
it was so hot and muggy all the time.
07:23
The campus itself, you know, the architecture of the grounds,
07:26
it all looked very appealing.
07:28
I liked seeing the rhododendron bushes in bloom, I liked seeing the grass and the
07:33
trees, it was such a change from what I was experiencing in Texas and what I’d
07:37
experiences in Utah for so long as well.
07:41
So, it looked welcoming.
07:43
And how long have you been with OSU?
07:46
I came in '97, so I guess this is my 18th year about.
07:51
Don’t hold me to that, I'm a linguist, not a mathematician.
07:56
Do you see yourself moving at any point in time?
08:00
That's a really tricky question.
08:01
I mean, I kind of would like to at this point, and I think some of the
08:06
questions that I’ve seen on your list that we'll be getting to later might
08:09
explain a little bit why it is I might want to at least want to leave here.
08:14
I don't think I’m going to end up leaving anytime soon.
08:17
Once you've gone through the process of getting
08:19
tenure at an academic institution, you really have to have something much, much
08:26
better lined-up because it's not a process that you want to have to go through again.
08:33
So yeah, that's something that honestly keeps me here, keeps me
08:38
from really looking too seriously at other career opportunities.
08:45
And your current position.
08:46
I am currently an assistant professor in the School of
08:49
Language, Culture, and Society.
08:51
That's a bit of a shift from what I was hired to do.
08:55
We've had some consolidations in the programs here.
08:58
So when I came to OSU, I was hired to be an assistant professor of Spanish
09:03
and Linguistics in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.
09:07
That's not a department that exists anymore--it's been merged into the School
09:12
of Language, Culture, and Society along with anthropology, ethnic studies, and
09:16
women, gender and sexuality studies.
09:19
Now, most people have retained some sort of connection with the original
09:26
programming--we’re referring to them as programs these days rather than
09:29
departments—but the positions are still associated with that program.
09:33
And, last year, I made a shift so that my position is officially
09:37
associated with the school now.
09:39
And I have access to different kinds of collaborations in teaching across the
09:46
entire set of programs rather than the expectation that all of my research,
09:50
all of my scholarship, and all of my teaching is going to be in the language
09:53
program, that's not the case anymore.
09:58
So, have you held any other positions within OSU besides that?
10:04
Nope, I’ve just been that the whole time.
10:07
And your job duties, can you describe those for us?
10:11
Sure.
10:11
It's a pretty standard academic appointment.
10:16
I haven't pulled out my job description for a long time, so I can't give you
10:20
the exact percentages, but roughly what
10:23
we're looking at is about 40% teaching and my service level percentage
10:33
has been a little bit higher than a lot of faculty members, much to the
10:37
dismay of some of the people who have been my supervisors over the years.
10:41
And that's something that we can probably talk about a little bit too, about why the
10:44
service percentage is a little bit higher.
10:47
And then, I’d guess probably they'd expect me to have another, maybe, 40% of my job
10:55
committed to scholarship of some sort.
10:57
And in real life, that ends up being a little bit lower as well.
11:01
I don't currently have administrative responsibilities.
11:05
But up until just this last year, I did actually have a percentage of my position
11:10
that was allocated to working with the contemporary Hispanic studies program.
11:15
I was directing that program.
11:17
And, I still am, but we didn't admit any new students this year, so I’m just
11:20
helping the 3 or 4 students we have in the program right now wrap up their
11:23
degrees, and it’s not taking the kind of time that I had to give it before.
11:30
And the types of duties, it's kind of a similar question.
11:35
Well, I mean, teaching is pretty self-explanatory when
11:38
it’s classroom instruction.
11:41
I was assigned an e-campus course to go along with my
11:44
face-to-face class this quarter.
11:48
And that hasn't been happening very frequently in the past, but I
11:52
think that that's something we’re going to see more, moving ahead.
11:54
I think I'm probably going to end up not having courses that are
11:59
exclusively taught only on campus.
12:02
I would prefer that my work-load be all courses taught on campus,
12:06
but, we'll see what happens.
12:09
Scholarship, there's a lot of breadth in what counts for that too.
12:14
What I spend my time doing is preparing conference presentations.
12:17
I go to a couple of professional meetings a year,--for example I’ve
12:20
got one coming up, I hope--I’ve sent my proposal—then I’ve got one coming
12:24
up in Puerto Rico in May for the Latin America Studies Association.
12:28
I've also got another proposal in for a conference in San Francisco
12:33
for the National Association of Chicano and Chicana Studies.
12:38
So that's that part of the scholarship.
12:41
I also have been doing my own creative writing that I've submitted for
12:45
publication and had some accepted.
12:47
And just recently finished working on a short documentary and plan to
12:55
spend more of my scholarship time on that moving forward as well.
13:00
I've got an idea for a film for winter quarter, we'll see if it works out.
13:05
So, can you describe the types of classes you teach?
13:10
Yeah, there's a wide range of classes that I teach.
13:12
I was hired, as I said before, to teach Spanish and linguistics, and so,
13:17
for most of the years that I've been at OSU, I have taught either Spanish
13:21
language classes, Spanish culture classes, linguistics classes, mostly
13:25
linguistics in Spanish, but also a few courses in English about linguistics.
13:33
There's a DPD course that I developed, and, strangely enough, even though we’re
13:36
a department that deals with language and culture, it’s a hot bed of DPD-type
13:41
issues, that’s the--I happen to have the only class in the program right
13:46
now that's a DPD course, and it's an English language linguistics course.
13:51
So that's mostly what I do.
13:52
I think the other course that people would think of, associate with me,
13:56
is the Spanish Learning Community.
13:58
And it’s a course that I developed with two colleagues, Loren Chavarría and
14:02
María Olaya, who’s no longer with us.
14:06
And, there have been different faculty members who have cycled through the
14:08
program throughout the last, you know, ten years that we've been doing it.
14:11
But, it's an intensive course--it's kind of like study abroad but here on campus.
14:16
It started out at 12 credits, and the next year we bumped it up to 15
14:20
and that's what it's been since then.
14:22
A 15 credit course--the students are with the instructors in the classroom
14:25
for, yeah, about 15 hours a week.
14:29
And then they do service learning activities for an additional
14:32
8 hours a week, so it's a huge commitment for everybody involved.
14:38
And, it’s a course that actually the team got a university-level
14:43
teaching award for as well.
14:46
And it’s been a really meaningful part of my teaching life; it’s
14:49
really kind of helped keep me enthusiastic about teaching in ways
14:53
that my other courses don't always.
14:59
Who's been important to you at OSU?
15:02
This is a little similar to the previous question, but I think more of it.
15:07
Hm.
15:09
So, we're talking people who’re important, but we maybe don't want
15:11
to call them mentors, I guess, right?
15:14
Well, the chair who hired me, Dr. Joseph Crouse, has over the years, been, I
15:21
think, an important ally in the program.
15:26
I think that we’ve had a shared vision about what language and culture
15:29
and education ought to be like.
15:32
And so, within my own program, I think that he’s a person who comes to mind.
15:37
I
15:40
remember looking down the list of questions before, that there’s
15:43
some questions that deal with people of color on campus.
15:44
And, I think that one of the things that’s been important is to find some community
15:50
outside of the academic department.
15:53
And so, other people who I think have been important to me, really kind
15:56
of in a peer relationship and not necessarily a mentor kind-of situation.
16:02
Dwaine Plaza for sure is someone who I think has been a tremendous support,
16:08
both personally and academically.
16:12
Who else?
16:12
I’m thinking people who aren't really even around here anymore.
16:14
Eileen Waldschmidt is someone who impacted my teaching philosophy
16:18
a lot, and she's no longer here at OSU as well, she moved to UNM.
16:25
Michael Ingram who was also a teacher educator and a poet who left OSU
16:32
after some health issues was really an important person in my life at
16:39
OSU, prior to his leaving campus.
16:42
Off the top of my head, I think that’s, you know, those
16:46
are people that I would name.
16:47
And, of course, my colleague, Loren Chavarría, who I mentioned
16:49
before who developed Learning Community Program with me.
16:53
That's been a really important relationship in a lot of different ways.
16:59
So the next set of questions is just about OSU community.
17:04
Have you seen the OSU community change over time as far as diversity?
17:10
You know, this is a difficult thing to address because the administration
17:14
is constantly pulling out all of these statistics that show favorable
17:19
trends when it comes to diversity, and somehow, I think, in the last
17:25
couple of years, I have ended up feeling a little bit more isolated
17:30
than before when it comes to diversity.
17:33
There was a faculty group, well, I mean, it still formally exists I
17:36
think, but hasn't been very active lately: The Association of Faculty for
17:41
the Advancement of People of Color.
17:42
It involved Dwaine Plaza and some of the people I mentioned.
17:47
That’s--it's not something that really seems to have a strong presence on campus
17:52
anymore, and so that's one change that I’d point to that kind of makes it feel
17:56
like the diversity climate’s a little bit less hospitable than it used to be.
18:01
I think one of the things that the administrators are relying on when
18:04
they say that things are getting better in terms of diversity are
18:07
the changes in student enrollment.
18:09
But, I have to say from my perspective--this is anecdotal, I
18:13
don't have the figures in front of me--I think that really it's the
18:16
INTO program that probably is what they’re relaying on the most when
18:20
they point to numbers, increasing numbers, of a diverse student body.
18:28
And I think that that is a situation that really is covering over a failure
18:33
to address what I think they need to be addressing, which is access of U.S.
18:41
underrepresented groups to the university.
18:44
I'm not really seeing huge numbers of Native American students on campus that
18:50
I didn't see before; I’m not seeing huge numbers of Latino students on
18:53
campus that I wasn’t seeing before.
18:55
And, sure, the numbers do show some incremental growth, but
19:01
I think that their optimism is a little bit overplayed when it
19:06
comes to changes in a positive direction for diversity on campus.
19:11
Kind of a side question, what's your opinion on the potential
19:16
blackout for the upcoming game?
19:18
Oh, are they doing one of those again?
19:22
You know, I don't know.
19:24
Don’t quote me; I do not know that it’s official.
19:26
Yeah?
19:29
It's just always been trouble; I just really wish the people would
19:33
stick with orange or something else.
19:36
Orange is equally festive, why not.
19:39
I don't know.
19:40
I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens and see if people
19:43
have the good sense to not go all out with afro fright wigs and black makeup.
19:49
I just, you know.
19:53
And along with that, are there any events or programs that stand out to you?
19:59
These can be programs that you think have a negative effect
20:02
or a positive effect on campus.
20:08
Well, I mean, there’s so many different kinds of programs too.
20:10
I mean, if you’re looking at what sorts of programs the students
20:13
end up creating, you know, I don’t really see a lot of change in that.
20:17
It seems to me that the cultural centers are present and active and are doing
20:21
the same kind of work that they’ve done ever since I got here, which is good.
20:24
They’re keeping—I mean, their mission is really being advanced,
20:30
advanced pretty effectively, I think.
20:31
I think they’re doing a good job at opening the doors to a lot of cultural
20:34
experiences that students on the OSU campus otherwise wouldn’t have access to.
20:40
If you look at the institutional-level, if you look at some of the reorganization
20:45
of the diversity and equity programing, again, I think this is one of these
20:51
things that the university would say, “Look, we’ve got a director of diversity
20:54
and inclusion and we’ve got all this good stuff going on, the departments
20:57
are being, are consolidated in a space where they can all interact with each
21:00
other and coordinate.’” But, these days I’m really not seeing as much of the
21:07
live faces of these people as I used to.
21:11
I used to see, you know, Angelo Gomez, the director, I used
21:14
to see a lot of him on campus.
21:17
But, the way that this has been set up these days, I mean, it’s just, it’s an
21:20
institutional position, it’s, I think, a huge time commitment on his part,
21:26
and it’s the kinds of face-to-face interactions that he used to have
21:30
with people of color on campus, I don’t think they’re really possible.
21:34
So, I don’t know.
21:36
Is this a program that’s changed for the better or is this a program that’s
21:40
left people feeling more isolated?
21:42
I don’t know, flip a coin.
21:44
I think in some ways you’d have to say that is, in fact, a good idea to have
21:47
all these programs consolidated and working closely with their president
21:50
and having set objectives that they can all focus on and move forward,
21:56
but at the same time, I don’t personally feel as connected as I did before when
22:01
things were organized institutionally in a more chaotic or, I really kind
22:07
of prefer to say organic fashion.
22:09
Because that’s really how diversity program, programing has worked on
22:13
the OSU campus when it’s worked at its best, it hasn’t been top down.
22:18
Things that are still kind of functioning pretty well, like the cultural centers,
22:22
those weren’t an idea that came out of the OSU administration, they were
22:29
student initiatives and people who cared about those particular things got
22:35
together and put the energy and time necessary into making the programing work.
22:40
And that’s, that has always, I think, been a more successful model for OSU
22:44
when it comes to diversity inclusion that institutional approaches.
22:49
So would you say that OSU’s diversity, future of a diverse, more diverse
22:55
campus lies within its students
22:59
and their power?
23:00
I think it, partly it does.
23:02
And I would maybe just say it a little bit more broadly, I’d say
23:04
that it kind of, it lies with
23:08
communities of color.
23:10
Being able to come together and being empowered to create what works for them
23:15
without excessive, yeah, without excessive manipulation by the institution into the
23:21
channeling into the directions that the institution thinks things need to go.
23:26
What do you see as OSU’s role of supporting staff and faculty of color?
23:32
Yeah, I mean, I think I’ve mostly answered that.
23:35
I think what they have done is set up some offices that we can
23:37
all call, check the websites,
23:42
and because I really haven’t had any issues that have required me to interact
23:47
with the university in that way, I don’t have any affirmative action
23:49
complaints that I need to make this week.
23:53
I suspect that that sort of thing is being dealt with very efficiently.
24:00
But, at the same time,
24:03
yeah, I don’t know.
24:04
It’s just, like I said before, I think I’m still feeling a little bit
24:07
disconnected from a lot of what’s going on here, and I suspect that
24:10
that’s going to continue that way.
24:13
What do you see as your role in supporting faculty and staff of color?
24:20
Well, I mean, what I can do is describe the role of that I’ve played up to this
24:23
point and that is that I have been an active participant in organizations and
24:27
groups of people who have been getting together to try and make things happen,
24:29
and when something needed to happen.
24:33
I would like to see the Association of Faculty for the Advancement of People
24:37
of Color get active again on campus.
24:40
I was in the leadership of that organization for a while and would
24:44
be more than willing to do that again if we would, kind of, get our
24:50
act together and keep moving ahead.
24:52
Um, other than that--the thing is you kind of get a little bit tired after a while.
25:02
And, I guess, one thing that I have to say is probably working well in the changes
25:06
that have been made in the institution, that students never really even see,
25:11
is the way that hiring is handled here.
25:14
All of the major hires on campus require the presence on a committee
25:19
of a diversity advocate, and those people are trained over by the
25:25
folks in equity and inclusion office.
25:28
That sort of job of having somebody to be a, just kind of, someone to keep
25:33
an eye on how the hiring process is working out, especially when there are
25:36
people of color being considered for a position or a position that needs
25:40
to have people of color considered.
25:42
That was all us, that was all on us.
25:44
And so, people of color on campus were on every committee imaginable.
25:50
And it was, it’s tricky.
25:51
You
25:54
come into a position like this, if you identify as coming from a community
25:56
of color, you come into the position with an appreciation for the work
26:02
that people have done ahead of time to make it possible to get into this
26:05
kind of institution in the first place.
26:07
And for that reason, you want to give back, you want to say “yes” when
26:10
opportunities come up to serve on a committee or to help the institution
26:14
develop its diversity goals. You look around and see students of color on
26:21
campus and you want things to be better for them moving forward and that’s
26:25
another motivating factor to keep involved in all these administrative
26:29
tasks that people keep throwing at you.
26:31
And, you know, I guess, the third thing that I would say
26:34
is we also have a little bit of self-preservation as a motivation too.
26:38
Because if policies are going to be made and they’re made without the input of
26:44
people of color, then it’s, you know, it’s far more likely that decisions are going
26:48
to made that impact us in a negative way.
26:51
So, I mean, there are your, kind of, three main motivators for staying
26:53
involved in diversity stuff here.
26:57
But at the same time, its tiring because if you are one of those people who
27:01
has identified as an active member of a community of color on campus, the,
27:06
you just end up getting called on for service responsibilities constantly.
27:09
That’s sort of what I was alluding to when I was talking
27:11
about the service percentage.
27:15
They really, you know, administrators don’t like to see
27:20
percentage of service higher than about 10 percent on a position description.
27:25
But, if you come from a community of color or other marginalized, underrepresented
27:30
communities on campus, it’s really tricky to keep 10 percent as the limit of the
27:36
amount of time of your work day that you commit to diversity or diversity
27:41
related or other kind of service because there just really aren’t enough
27:45
people of color on campus to spread all of that work around and not have it
27:49
become at least a little bit burdensome to keep you from doing other things
27:52
that you would like to be doing, so.
27:57
What recommendations do you have for OSU to become a more inclusive campus?
28:04
Well I think I’ve mentioned a couple things that are going the right direction:
28:06
the hiring initiatives, having people who are helping hiring committees
28:14
carry out equitable searches I think is going to, at least incrementally, lead
28:18
to having more people on campus to share
28:23
the work of building community and diversifying the faculty and student body.
28:30
I don’t know, it’s just slow going.
28:32
I really think that what I, what I hope that it will do, as I mentioned before,
28:37
is not rely too heavily on internal, structural reorganizations and think
28:42
that that’s going to be a solution, it’s not because this is really about people.
28:45
And so, whatever the university can do to encourage the building of community
28:52
that actually gets people to interact with each other face-to-face as
28:56
opposed to being in the appropriate spot on our organizational chart.
28:59
I mean, this is really what you need I think, for us, you know, forward.
29:05
Um, please reflect on the season of change the university is currently
29:09
in, and where you think its heading.
29:14
When has OSU not been in a season of change?
29:17
Right.
29:18
I guess it’s the nature of a university.
29:20
Big picture, I think OSU is doing what every other major research
29:24
institution is doing, which
29:28
is—there’s a good book that people ought to check out, University in Chains.
29:32
It describes, kind of at the beginning of the book—there’s a famous speech
29:38
that you’ve probably heard about where this notion of the military-industrial
29:42
complex comes up, years and years ago.
29:46
As it turns out, original drafts of that speech actually referred to the
29:49
military-industrial-academic complex.
29:52
And I think that we are moving into this period where universities, major
29:55
research universities, are pretty overtly taking on this role of being
30:03
part of this large, imperialistic, capitalistic, neoconservative,
30:10
hegemonic—got to throw that word in there—entity.
30:15
So, I don’t know how you slow that, I really don’t.
30:20
But that’s, you know, honestly that’s where I see OSU heading.
30:24
And I think I’ve got evidence for that too; I mean, the consolidation of programs
30:28
I described before where the World Language Department ended up being merged
30:33
with these other disciplines under a single director, we all lost our chairs.
30:38
So, all of the hiring decisions, decisions about promotion, about class
30:46
assignments, evaluation of our teaching, research, scholarship, all that that
30:50
stuff, it’s being handled by somebody who doesn’t know our discipline.
30:53
And, I think there are people up to this point who’ve been, who have had good
30:57
intentions, but really, it is turning us into a commodity and that’s something
31:03
that I really dislike about higher ed.
31:05
these days, but I don’t know how to stop it, so.
31:10
You think it’s something that’s just going to keep growing?
31:12
Oh absolutely.
31:13
Yeah, I really do.
31:15
It’s happening with all of—you know, I could call up any number of colleagues
31:19
right now and they’d give you the same story about what’s happening.
31:22
There’s been this conflict at University of Illinois, at Urbana Champaign,
31:26
where they’ve had their board of trustees override a hiring decision
31:34
based, as far as we can tell, on memos from a donor.
31:38
You know, the donor was unhappy with the hiring of this particular person, and then
31:44
the administration at that institution was all too happy to pull the plug on
31:49
the department, hiring department’s decision because it didn’t - you
31:53
know - it made them look bad, it didn’t.
31:56
And that sort of thing is happening all over the country, so I’m not making it up.
32:02
What are some issues of importance with respect to people of color
32:08
that the community is facing?
32:12
Well, I think you’re probably referring to the community
32:15
meaning the campus, community.
32:17
Yes.
32:17
But I think that one of the challenges faced by communities of color at OSU is
32:22
Corvallis and the fact that Corvallis is a small town, and we are isolated
32:28
from larger populations that allow us to have access to the kinds of things
32:33
we need, both socially and otherwise.
32:40
And I’ve had to find my own solution to this.
32:41
And so, one of the things that I’ve had to do because Corvallis
32:45
really isn’t offering me socially what I need, I keep an apartment in
32:48
Portland, and I’m there half the week.
32:50
I have to be someplace else.
32:52
I would like OSU to acknowledge
32:59
the limitations of the physical space here, of the community
33:06
itself, the community in which the university is situated.
33:12
Anyway, yeah.
33:13
What do you think OSU needs?
33:15
OSU needs—I can think of all sorts of solutions that would work better than me
33:19
having to have an apartment in Portland.
33:21
And that would be the university having, I don’t know, Van Pools,
33:27
maybe that allow people to be where they need to be, physically.
33:31
I mean, because you can’t make Corvallis be what, anything other than what it is.
33:37
And I don’t think OSU realistically can make up for the deficiencies
33:41
of Corvallis on campus.
33:45
So, trying to make it easier for people to live the kind of lifestyle
33:50
that they need to, I think this is kind of where I’m headed with this.
33:54
Things like having faculty residences on campus, maybe, where you could live in
34:03
Portland if you need to live in Portland, and have it not be such a financial
34:08
hit, but have some place to be here so that you can participate in community,
34:12
campus life as well, something like that.
34:15
To facilitate transportation as well, between larger urban
34:20
centers that offer the social environment that you need in campus.
34:24
I don’t know, I mean, this is something I could, if I sat and thought about
34:27
it and brainstormed for a half hour, I could maybe come up with more ideas.
34:30
But off the top of my head, I mean—that’s one of the things that OSU’s gonna
34:34
have to deal with—the fact that they can’t do what we need, they can’t.
34:38
Yeah.
34:39
Another question, so, like, by when you say, like, social things, do
34:42
you mean, like just cultural things that aren’t in Corvallis that are
34:47
in big places like Portland, too?
34:49
Just, you know what I mean?
34:51
I don’t mean, like, things that the university can do to, like making cultural
34:55
institutions, I mean like things in Corvallis or--there are things in Portland
35:00
and bigger cities that aren’t here in Corvallis which makes it not as livable.
35:03
‘Cuz there’s a guy in my multicultural issues in education class and he says
35:08
he can’t find a place to get his hair cut here, he has to go to Portland.
35:11
So, stuff like that.
35:13
Obviously I do not have that issue, but you know.
35:15
Yeah, yeah, yeah but just those like general cultural openness.
35:18
But yeah, but I did get my hair cut in Portland last time.
35:20
And it’s—in this, they’ve got these little, like, hipster barber
35:23
shops where they hand you a Miller Light when you walk in the door.
35:27
They ask you at the end if you want to get your eyebrows trimmed, and it’s just
35:30
like, it’s not Corvallis, it’s different.
35:32
Um, yeah.
35:35
I mean, Corvallis is not ever going to make up for those, those situations.
35:41
But you’re right; I do know people who have difficulty with things like
35:45
getting the grooming products that they need or getting their hair cut.
35:48
I have difficulty getting access to the kind of food that I’d like to have
35:53
for certain kinds of celebrations.
35:55
It’s really not easy to get, for example, like the corn to make
35:58
Pozole, which is something that, that I would make for something like
36:01
Thanksgiving or Christmas ‘cuz that’s something that we do in my family.
36:06
Um.
36:07
But, Portland, not so hard.
36:08
I mean, there are restaurants that serve it without me having to
36:12
make it by myself kind of thing.
36:15
And it’s not just
36:19
that, it’s not just access to goods and services, but different
36:23
kinds of cultural experiences too.
36:25
I’m taking my students, for example, to the Miracle Theatre,
36:30
Teatro Milagro, this Sunday.
36:33
And, Natalia knows about this because they’ve got boxes
36:36
and boxes of their stuff.
36:39
That is a Latino theatre organization that has been in operation for
36:44
30 years now, and we have nothing like it here, nothing like it.
36:49
And, my ability to interact with them for, in the last few years, has been
36:53
fantastic both for my social life—to be able to see different aspects of my
36:58
culture represented openly, publicly, on-stage, I mean, that’s a good thing.
37:03
But, in addition to that, they’re the fiscal sponsors for
37:06
a poetry group, writing group that I work with in Portland.
37:10
And we’re having a reading there on Sunday before the play
37:12
that my students are seeing.
37:13
So,
37:15
it’s not just my social life, I should be clear about that.
37:19
It’s my professional life is enhanced by access to someplace other than Corvallis
37:24
too because there’s just, there is no Latino writers group in Corvallis that
37:29
lets me do public readings in venues that are recognized as important state-wide,
37:34
like literary arts in Portland.
37:36
And I’ve been able to do readings there because I’ve
37:38
had this connection with people
37:43
in Portland.
37:44
Corvallis, and yeah—I mean, the campus people just—I’ve actually,
37:47
this isn’t supposed to happen, and if you’ve got you’re diversity
37:49
advocate doing what he or she is supposed to do, this doesn’t happen.
37:52
But, I have been on hiring committees where people have said, “Well, you
37:55
know, I don’t think this person’s going to contribute to the community
37:58
because they’re not going to want to live in Corvallis.” That can’t
38:02
be a reason for not hiring somebody.
38:04
And, furthermore, the university should recognize the value of having people
38:08
like that on campus and make it as easy as possible for them to live where they
38:12
need to live to be able to do the job for the university that the university needs.
38:17
But…
38:20
Looking at the, kind of, the bigger picture.
38:27
What—again with respect to people of color—what issues of importance
38:30
do you think they’re facing in regards of state and nationwide?
38:35
Statewide and nationwide, woo.
38:37
This is a big question.
38:39
Yeah, I mean it really is.
38:40
I mean the macro level we still see from census data, that sort of
38:45
thing, that there is not wage parity.
38:48
We see that there isn’t in fact—you know, we’ve got higher rate of poverty,
38:53
higher rates of incarceration for people of color, all that kind of thing.
38:56
And I don’t know exactly how it is that we, here, address those national trends.
39:00
But those are certainly things that affect all of the communities of color.
39:03
Um, and this kind of—one of the interesting things that I think people
39:08
might be talking about when you have these conversations with them on campus is
39:15
we seem to have this mistaken impression in the U.S. these days that we’re
39:18
in this post-racial environment, that people really have gotten to
39:24
the point where they don’t see race and so we don’t have problems with
39:28
discrimination, overt discrimination.
39:31
Any person of color on campus will tell you that in fact
39:34
it’s something that happens.
39:36
It may not be the case that people have, I don’t know, nooses hung on
39:40
their doors the way we would have in situations like that in the past,
39:46
past racial incidence on campus.
39:48
But, there’s just, kind of, this grinding micro-aggression thing that keeps going.
39:56
There’s not a single person of color on campus, I think, that wouldn’t tell you
40:00
that yeah there’ve been some times in any given month there will be a number
40:05
of occasions in which they’d have to, kind of, catch themselves thinking,
40:09
“Do I really belong here? Was I an affirmative action hire? Am I being
40:13
asked to do twice as much work because everybody assumes that people of my
40:17
background are this way or that way?”
40:20
That’s something that is so covert, I think, in most cases, it continues to be
40:25
a huge problem, and it’s not one that’s easily recognized or pointed to or proven.
40:29
I think at the national level, that’s sort of what we’re fighting, this
40:33
concept of racism not being a factor anymore in American public life when
40:38
the lived experience is otherwise.
40:44
Coming back to OSU, who do you think it’s on, who do you think
40:47
can really cause change here?
40:53
Well, like I said, I think the only people who have been able to make
40:55
effective change at OSU have been people of color themselves getting together and
41:03
making change happen.
41:05
I don’t think that it should be our responsibility, that said.
41:11
I don’t know how to make that dynamic change.
41:16
And I almost hate saying this because I know that Ed Ray,
41:18
for example, at the top of the organizational chart, I do believe
41:23
that he does have a commitment to enhancing diversity on campus.
41:29
And I think that off and on he’s made some good steps too and gotten
41:33
some of the right people close to him that can help advise him
41:36
about how that should best happen.
41:42
But, at the same time, it still seems to me that the institutional mindset is
41:45
what’s prevailing here and not, as I was saying before, the needs of individuals.
41:51
I mean, I think that the grass-roots level type stuff is sort of getting lost right
41:56
now in all of the institutional change.
42:03
And then, so, kind of a transition here.
42:06
The next questions are just the topics mainly pertain to your work.
42:12
What made you pursue your masters and your Ph.D. that you currently possess?
42:19
Well, I think that I had already decided by the end of my B.A.
42:24
program that I wanted to go into university-level teaching.
42:30
And, this is really the only way to do it, if you don’t get a Ph.D. in higher
42:35
ed., you’re pretty much relegated to adjunct status, which means you never
42:39
get a full-time position; you end up, at best, getting maybe an annual contract.
42:44
And so, it’s—you know, once you make the commitment to be in higher ed.
42:50
as your profession, the decision whether to get a Ph.D. is
42:54
made for you, you gotta do it.
42:59
Which was fine, because I think that I have always enjoyed being a student.
43:03
I don’t know how it looks from the student’s perspective, but, to me,
43:09
being a grad student and being a professor doesn’t feel that different.
43:14
When you’re an advanced graduate student, they’ve already got you teaching classes,
43:17
and so that’s something that I was already doing, interacting with students.
43:20
And I was already being expected to do an awful lot of research and
43:25
writing and that’s what I’m doing now.
43:30
So, it doesn’t end up feeling like a very abrupt transition from graduate
43:35
school into professional life.
43:37
Did you know starting college what you wanted to do?
43:43
I think, like most students, I made a couple of changes in major early on.
43:50
But it had sort of settled in by the time I was in my junior year.
43:53
Well, a junior in credits, let’s say, because at BYU things
43:57
are a little bit different.
43:57
The normal path for a student at BYU at the undergraduate level, and this may
44:02
be changing a little bit due to some changes in Mormon Church policies, but
44:08
the normal path was to go to college for maybe a year and then take two
44:12
years off to go on a mission for the church someplace and then come back.
44:18
But since I started college so young, I was only 17, I was a
44:21
junior in credits before the mission time came around, and I needed to
44:26
have committed to a program before
44:27
that happened.
44:28
So I was already a Spanish linguistics major before I
44:33
went to Mexico on a mission.
44:37
And, I think that the reason I chose that field was--I think it was
44:40
something that felt to me like it was helping fill in some gaps in my
44:46
understanding about who I was as a Latino.
44:49
Growing up in Tacoma, you know, it really wasn’t, at that time, any
44:54
more accommodating than Corvallis when, you know, it comes to access
44:57
to some kind of cultural presence.
45:01
Tacoma has changed an awful lot, if any of you have been there recently, you’re
45:06
probably wondering, it’s like, “What the hell is he talking about, there’s
45:08
plenty of diversity in South Puget Sound region.” But, when I was growing up, you
45:14
know, the only other Latinos that were around were, maybe, the children of Puerto
45:20
Ricans who were serving in the military who were stationed at either McChord
45:26
or Fort Lewis—and that’s all there was. But, you know, actual Latinos
45:30
staying in the community and building businesses and community centers or
45:36
chambers of commerce, all that kind of thing, that wasn’t happening back then.
45:40
And so, having a chance to be in these classes where we were
45:43
talking about literature connected to my family and my ancestry,
45:51
that’s, you know, that was very appealing to me.
45:55
And once you get committed to a particular track that far, then
45:58
you’ll just kind of keep going.
46:00
So…
46:02
Can you tell us what your doctoral dissertation was and why you chose that?
46:08
Oh, okay sure.
46:09
My doctoral dissertation was about changes in the Spanish of New Mexico
46:15
over a 300-year period, roughly.
46:18
So
46:21
my training is in Spanish linguistics, and specifically in philology, it’s
46:25
sort of where you, kind of, look at language change over a period of time.
46:32
Now, the University of Texas, even though its located in the U.S.
46:34
Southwest, at least at the time, that was a department where looking at
46:40
Spanish of the U.S. Southwest was not
46:44
really, it wasn’t really welcome.
46:46
It’s not--it wasn’t really considered serious enough.
46:50
My classmates were doing things like, oh let’s see, one was
46:54
studying the letters written by Christopher Columbus in Spanish.
46:59
So, that’s the sort of text that they kind of expected us
47:04
to be looking at, working with.
47:06
And so, I went off in this other direction.
47:08
And again, it’s really the same reason, I wanted to have a better
47:10
understanding, using my own disciplinary tools, a better understanding of
47:13
where my own family comes from.
47:17
And there’s all sorts of mythology that’s built up in New Mexico about us
47:21
all being really Spanish, not Mexican, not indigenous, we’re Spanish, we
47:27
all speak a language, a variety of Spanish that’s taken directly from a
47:33
time of the conquistadores and Cervantes, and it’s more pure and more wonderful.
47:37
And so that’s really what I was questioning with my doctoral dissertation,
47:41
looking at what specific forms existed at the beginning of the existence
47:46
of documents in New Mexico through the American period when actually
47:52
the U.S. government was in charge of the territory, the territorial
47:55
government was running things.
48:00
And yeah, I mean, sure enough it did play out the way I expected, which is
48:06
that the mythology was mostly that;
48:11
people in New Mexico do not, in fact, speak a variety of Spanish, it descended
48:16
directly from the conquistadores, it’s subject to the same kinds of forces
48:21
that other kinds of language are.
48:24
But, that’s what I was looking at and that’s why I was looking at it.
48:28
And you said you recently produced a short film, a documentary.
48:33
What was your—what was that process like?
48:35
What was your inspiration for this?
48:38
I did.
48:38
Okay, well, I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while, but I got a chance to
48:41
use some of my development money from my department to take a class in documentary
48:46
filmmaking; and it’s the Northwest documentaries’ DIY documentary workshop.
48:51
What they have you do is pull together a short film in ten weeks.
48:55
So
49:01
what I decided to do was work with a topic that I had worked with before in
49:06
other media, a topic that I’d written short stories about, a topic that I’d
49:11
written poetry about just to see how close I could get in film to keeping
49:17
the same kind of tone that my writing has because, I think, my writing, if you
49:21
were to look at it, has this, kind of, interesting mix of emotions—there are
49:26
parts of it that are really kind of funny, there are parts of it that are tragic and
49:30
poignant, and it’s just like, you know, can I pull this off with visual imagery?
49:35
So that’s the reason that I picked the topic that I picked, which was
49:39
experiences of gay Mormon missionaries and their reflection on their mission
49:44
experiences as adults later in life.
49:49
And, yeah, I think it worked out pretty well, actually.
49:50
I do think that the short films, ten minute short, I think it does
49:55
hit some of the same sorts of emotional notes that my writing hits.
50:01
But that’s why I picked that one.
50:01
I just wanted to work with something that I didn’t have to develop the storyline
50:04
so much; I could concentrate on the tone and see if I could replicate.
50:10
And then, kind of the same question with what’s your process been like
50:14
for your Queer Chicano spiritualties
50:21
work?
50:22
So, let’s see, what you’re referring to is an article that’s
50:27
going to be coming out in a book.
50:29
And,
50:32
I haven’t been out all that long, actually; I came out at
50:36
work just over four years ago.
50:41
And before that, you know, I just kind of—this is interesting because we’re
50:46
talking about community needs, and my community needs have shifted over the
50:48
years because there was the identity as a person of color, as a Chicano male.
50:54
You know, that’s one set of needs, one kind of community that you need;
50:59
but then, when it’s like, “okay well, maybe I need to come out now,” that
51:04
added a whole different dimension.
51:05
And it was really then when I was like, “Portland, I must be
51:09
in Portland, I can’t do this.”
51:14
So that all changed, and
51:19
when I came out I started trying to figure out different ways to just
51:22
kind of get up to speed because coming out at 46 is, it’s a bit of a shock.
51:30
These days, I think people are used to people coming out as
51:34
queer, you know, as early as high school or maybe even before that.
51:41
One of the things, and I don’t know if you’ve read Dan Savage, I mean
51:43
he’s a controversial figure, but one of things that he has said about
51:46
people coming out is that no matter what age you are when it happens, you
51:52
become, you become 15 in gay years.
51:57
You become 15, and you end up in this weird adolescence spot.
52:03
And so, I started doing a lot of writing and exploration just to kind
52:07
of, as I said, kind of get up to speed.
52:10
I think in gay years, I am still not yet quite at my actual age, which is 50.
52:17
But,
52:21
it really helped doing all that writing.
52:23
And, it was within, gee, I think it was within six months of coming out
52:27
to my colleagues at work that I taught my first Latino-queer studies course,
52:31
and that’s where I started doing a lot of the creative writing—just kind
52:35
of working along with the students.
52:37
I do kind of like to do that, when I assign students a poem or a paper or
52:39
something, I try to do it along with them.
52:42
Not so much because I think I can give them a model of how it ought
52:47
to be when they write, but just, you know, I just like learning to be
52:53
more of a collaborative process.
52:54
I mean, I don’t think I’ve really, in a long time, gone into the classroom
52:58
with this assumption that I am the expert and everybody else needs to just
53:01
kind of listen to what I have to say.
53:03
So I, so I try to engage in the process of learning along with
53:07
the students in the class—and that’s where the writing started.
53:10
And over the, maybe, next three years, I wrote a lot of different pieces
53:16
that helped me work through different aspects of my upbringing--kind of,
53:19
sort of reimagining, reinterpreting
53:24
events in my life
53:27
now that I was free to do that through a queer lens that I wasn’t allowing
53:31
myself to look through before.
53:34
So, when this opportunity came up to write this journal, this article
53:37
for this book, I just kind of went through all over the stories that I
53:41
had been working on for these last few years and decided to just, kind of,
53:47
put them all into one, big narrative.
53:49
So this is pretty much my manifesto; this is me describing my relationship with
53:54
myself and coming to terms with who I am and the decisions that I had to make.
54:01
And, I mean, there’s a very specific shift
54:03
in identity that we have happening here, and that’s a shift in
54:07
identifying primarily as someone who comes from a Mormon background
54:13
to someone who has, I
54:20
don’t know—I mean, I guess I’d have to read it again to kind
54:23
of let you know how it ends.
54:24
I mean, it really ends with my walking away from the Mormon Church, and the
54:32
last line, I think, is—I can’t remember it to quote it for you here—but,
54:36
it really is meant to convey to the reader that I’m at a starting point.
54:40
It’s not so much like I have shifted from this and now I am this; it’s more
54:44
like I have left this, and now the world is finally open to me, and I
54:48
can find out what’s next--that’s kind of where that piece of writing goes.
54:56
And, some last concluding questions.
55:00
What were, or are, some of your challenges and how you’ve
55:04
strived to overcome them—this is kind of a transition question.
55:08
Oh my, challenges.
55:12
These can be personal; these can be within the university.
55:17
Some of the challenges in the university I’ve just kind of walked away from.
55:20
I mean one of the things that I really haven’t talked about in this is that
55:23
you’re not going to have other people here who have been at OSU for 18 years who
55:27
come in and say they’re at the assistant professor rank—‘cuz that’s not normal.
55:32
Usually what happens is you go through the promotion and tenure process and if you’re
55:36
granted tenure, then you’re also given a promotion to the rank of Associate.
55:40
And, for some reason, there’s a group of us who had a different experience, and I
55:46
don’t know if you’re going to be talking to some of these people too, they might
55:49
or might not want to discuss it because I think it was very painful for all of us.
55:56
Yeah, within a two-year period, I can name off the top of my head, like, about
56:01
five other people who had the same thing happen—who, they went through the normal
56:06
promotion and tenure process, ended up being granted tenure at the university
56:10
without being given a promotion.
56:11
And all of them have, in subsequent years, gone back through the
56:14
process and had themselves promoted to the rank of Associate.
56:19
So that’s a challenge that I have chosen to not take on, I just haven’t done it,
56:23
I haven’t gone back through that process.
56:24
I found the whole thing just really too dehumanizing.
56:27
So,
56:33
and I don’t know—any challenges that I have taken on, just kind of shift in
56:38
interest academically and personally.
56:41
I think that I’ve--I’m grateful to my administrators for letting me do this,
56:46
and I’m proud of myself for taking on this big project of moving away from
56:53
computational linguistics and broadening the scope of my research scholarly
56:57
activities to include other aspects of my identity that are important, just
57:02
as important to explore as the Spanish language and culture part was when I
57:06
first started my educational process back at BYU so many, many years ago.
57:14
I don’t know, I don’t know--do I have a method?
57:15
I guess not.
57:16
Sometimes the method is to walk away, and sometimes the method is just to
57:19
plunge right in knowing full well that there is going to be some difficulty
57:23
involved, that things aren’t going to come out so smoothly, that maybe some
57:26
of those writings gonna be crappy, that maybe people are gonna like my movie or
57:29
maybe they’re not gonna like my movie.
57:31
And, as you get older, as I get older, I think I’m starting to get to the point
57:36
that I want to be at where I just do not give a shit about what other people think
57:40
about the direction that I’m heading, that I can be confident in my own motion,
57:44
whatever direction I choose to go, so.
57:48
What do you see as some of your great accomplishments?
57:52
Great accomplishments... The learning community project on campus, I think,
57:56
has been an important accomplishment.
57:59
AFAPC, the faculty group I was telling you about before; I’m not going to
58:03
claim credit to the entire organization, but I think that I was instrumental
58:07
in getting a lot of good things done along with a lot of other fine
58:09
colleagues during the, our heyday.
58:12
I’m proud of that.
58:13
For many years, people, even though we weren’t really official,
58:17
administrators were coming to us and saying okay well we’ve got this
58:19
issue going on, what do you think?
58:21
People cared about what we thought, and I think that was a huge accomplishments.
58:27
Um.
58:29
I mean those were the two that kind of come to mind within OSU, I think.
58:34
And you know, personally, I think it is a big accomplishment to finally let go
58:39
of some things that were holding me back.
58:41
Just,
58:43
to be able to come out, to be able to leave Mormonism behind, and
58:49
free myself up to explore other ways of living and being, that’s taken
58:54
a lot of my energy and attention.
58:57
And even though things aren’t exactly the way I’d like them to be,
59:01
I’m pretty comfortable with that.
59:04
I think it’s something that took a lot of effort and glad I did it.
59:11
And finally, is there anything that we have not discussed
59:14
that you would like to add?
59:16
I cannot think of anything.
59:21
We covered a lot of territory.
59:23
We did.
59:24
Thank you.
59:24
Sure.
