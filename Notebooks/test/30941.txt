00:01
Okay.
00:02
Our names are Jordan Rodgers, Viktor Rodriquez, and Jenny Vorvik.
00:06
We are students in Oregon State University’s U-Engage Class: Untold
00:10
Stories of People of Color in Oregon.
00:12
Today’s date is November 3rd, 2014, and we are conducting an oral history
00:18
interview with Marilyn Stewart.
00:23
Okay, please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:26
Okay.
00:27
My name is Marilyn, M-A-R-I-L-Y-N.
00:30
Stewart, S-T-E-W-A-R-T.
00:33
Great, thank you.
00:35
Your birthplace?
00:38
Uh, my birthplace is in the South, Dawsonville, Georgia.
00:46
Which ethnic or cultural background would you identify yourself with?
00:51
Identify—I identify myself as a Black American.
00:58
When and where were your parents born, and what are their backgrounds?
01:03
My parents were born in the late 1930s, and they were born in northern Florida.
01:13
Where did you grow up?
01:14
And then, where were you raised?
01:20
I was born in Georgia simply because in northern Florida it was faster to
01:27
get to the Georgia town than it was to get to the hospital in Florida.
01:33
So even though I say I was born in Georgia, I was basically raised in
01:40
northern Florida in a small town called Marianna -- Marianna, Florida.
01:44
And did you live there throughout, like, your adolescence or?
01:47
Absolutely.
01:48
Okay, cool.
01:51
What was your transition from high school to college?
01:55
That was an interesting time.
01:58
My transition was really about—because I was a younger
02:05
student in the sense of I--when I graduated, I was 17.
02:09
So, when I started college, I was 17.
02:12
And so, there were a number of my peers who were already 18 and some
02:19
19 in their first year of college.
02:21
So, it was a, it was a real interesting transition because,
02:28
partly because, I had a
02:33
difficult time in high school and then my guidance counsellor didn’t think that
02:41
I was—quote, unquote—college material.
02:47
You know, looking back I could kind of see I didn’t fit perfectly into a definition
02:55
of a college student, but I was a good student; I just wasn’t a great student.
03:01
Interesting.
03:02
Thank you.
03:04
Where did you attend school and what did you study?
03:08
At college?
03:09
Yes.
03:10
Okay.
03:11
My first college was Chipola Junior College.
03:14
And, at the time, there was a difference between junior
03:18
colleges and community colleges.
03:21
Junior colleges were really, kind of, pathways into four year institutions.
03:26
And so, when I went to Chipola, I wanted to be an accountant.
03:34
Now, because I was first generation, low-income, person of color, I
03:40
didn’t necessarily have what I needed to be able to determine how
03:46
that was gonna be about; I just knew that I wanted to be an accountant.
03:51
And that was more about what I had been told that I did well while I was in
03:57
school and just some encouragement from some of the clubs that I had joined.
04:04
For instance, I was in FBLA—Future Business Leaders of America—when
04:10
I was in high school and I enjoyed being in that club.
04:14
So, I thought for sure I was gonna be an accountant.
04:19
And even further, I was gonna be a CPA.
04:22
So then at what point did you realize that that wasn’t what…?
04:27
My very first college algebra class [laughter] , yeah.
04:36
You know,
04:39
I was not prepared for college algebra.
04:43
And, at that time, there weren’t a lot of assistance and support
04:50
for students who weren’t ready immediately to go into certain classes.
04:57
And so, I sat there and I just was not prepared for what the professor was
05:05
teaching, and I didn’t know how to ask the questions that I needed to ask without
05:13
coming off as what my guidance counsellor said—I should not be in college.
05:20
And so, I didn’t, and so my first term was not a great term.
05:25
Interesting.
05:26
Okay,
05:29
who were and are your mentors, personally and professionally?
05:33
Hm.
05:35
My mentors, aside from the obvious of my parents, I would
05:43
go as far as to go back there.
05:46
I was also in the military and one of my first real bosses, his name was
05:53
Ken Strain, and he saw a different type of potential that I had.
06:01
And so, he would talk to me about taking classes, and, at the time,
06:07
there was a lot of correspondence classes and things like that that
06:11
was available to military personal.
06:16
And I took some of those, and I also—he signed me up, basically, for
06:24
any extra training for computers, which was just really, kind of,
06:29
coming out to mainstream offices and
06:36
things—so this was in 1985, so ’85, ’86.
06:40
Okay.
06:42
And at what point of your, like, lifetime was that?
06:44
Like, was this after college?
06:46
This was after college; I hadn’t--I didn’t graduate, I joined the military.
06:53
And so, while I was in the military, one of my first, very
06:57
first, true mentors was Ken Strain.
07:01
And after that,
07:05
then when I came here, which was in 1989, I—my first mentor was Tom Marsh.
07:14
And Tom was the dean of the graduate school at that time.
07:20
And I do have others, Lawrence Griggs, Janet Nishihara,
07:27
yeah.
07:28
Needless to say, my husband,
07:32
in-laws, yeah.
07:33
Yeah, for sure.
07:34
Okay, cool.
07:35
Thank you.
07:42
So why did you decide to come to Corvallis, and specifically Oregon State?
07:47
Again, that I would attribute to my husband who is actually from the area.
07:54
I was from Florida, he’s from Oregon, and so we moved back here so he could
08:01
continue his education, and I worked.
08:06
So, that’s how I met Doctor Marsh when I first got here.
08:10
Where did you meet your husband?
08:12
In Washington D.C.
08:13
Okay.
08:14
Was that through military?
08:15
Mmhmm, we were both in the military.
08:19
And then, what were your first impressions of the university and
08:22
then Corvallis as a community?
08:28
My initial impression was that it was just beautiful.
08:34
I moved here in August, in late August.
08:37
And to come to Corvallis in August or September is the time to be here because
08:45
it was just beautiful, the tree-lined streets and it really, it, very green.
08:51
And my town where I’m from in northern Florida is very green and lots of
08:59
trees, and it just made me feel at home.
09:04
So, since you moved here, have you been here since?
09:07
Or did you ever move around?
09:09
I did move a little bit.
09:11
I moved here in ’89, and then in ’91, we moved to Sacramento, California.
09:18
And we were there for a couple of years and then we moved back
09:22
to Corvallis and OSU in 1994, and I’ve been here ever since.
09:30
And what jobs have you held here at OSU, like job duties?
09:35
Okay.
09:36
Well, let’s go—my current position is acting co-director for EOP, the
09:46
Educational Opportunities Program.
09:49
But I’ve also held positions—executive assistant, office coordinator,
09:56
operations manager, advisor, also academic counsellor.
10:00
Do
10:03
you think that your past with your high school academic counsellor and going
10:07
through that whole situation of you saying that he, or, your counsellor
10:12
told you that you weren’t college material, do you think that influences
10:14
your position for your career today?
10:18
Absolutely, very much so.
10:22
When she said that to me, it really took something away from what I thought; I was
10:32
very conscious about being an empowered young woman and I felt like, “Oh yeah I
10:40
can do anything.” And, it was so deflating
10:48
for this counsellor to say that to me.
10:52
And I didn’t realize it, like, right away because when you’re 17 or 16,
10:58
you’re kind of, just, not, more reacting versus thinking and then coming up
11:05
with something to follow up after that.
11:08
I just kind of internalized it, and I didn’t really realize to
11:12
what degree until later in life.
11:15
And as I move through—even when I was in the military and then afterwards,
11:23
that was sort of a path that I was on of assisting others--and definitely in higher
11:31
ed., but that came a little bit later.
11:36
Who has been important to you here at OSU in terms of your work and position?
11:42
Uh, who has been important to me.
11:45
Well, I guess I’ll start by saying, definitely my colleagues.
11:52
And one in particular who has been with me since--we started together in the
11:58
program 20 years ago, her name is Urmila.
12:01
And so, Urmila and I—who is also one of my, is another co-director
12:07
for EOP right now while our director is taking an interim
12:11
position.
12:13
Urmila and I have not only grown, but--we have grown together, but
12:19
we have, we’ve kept a very close working relationship as well.
12:27
And so, aside from her, I would also add other, some former
12:31
colleagues who have gone to other positions as well as my supervisors.
12:38
And my students as well I would put in that category.
12:45
How have you seen the Oregon State community change over time in
12:49
terms of diversity and inclusion?
12:55
It’s changed in some ways, in some ways not as much, but it really has changed.
13:02
I think it’s grown in some areas and
13:08
maybe declined in others.
13:12
Can you elaborate on
13:15
that?
13:16
Well, when I say declined, because that’s probably one of the ones that
13:20
you pick up on first, I would—when I think in numbers, I think in
13:28
numbers of African American students to OSU has declined over the years.
13:36
I would say,
13:39
in regards to the numbers that the university has now, which we’re
13:47
on the verge of 30,000 students, and at the time when I was here,
13:51
I think we were around 11 or 12.
13:54
And so, to have around the same number in African American students, I
14:01
would say, it’s definitely not grown.
14:07
Are there any events, initiatives, programs in particular that stand
14:11
out besides, just, the amount of people that you were talking about
14:17
before, the changes over time.
14:21
Are there any kind of programs or events you think that have
14:24
changed throughout the years?
14:25
Yes.
14:26
As a matter of fact--and I want to say it was ’96 or ’97 when the university really
14:36
had a large push, and the MEO, which was the Minority Education Offices, were first
14:48
created, which is now ISS--the Intercultural Student Services,
14:55
I believe it is--which is also still in a transition.
15:02
What do you see as the OSU’s role supporting faculty and staff
15:06
of color and students of color?
15:10
Well, that one—I’m looking down because I believe I decided to think
15:18
about that a little bit more because I
15:23
wanted to be more intentional about my thoughts around that because
15:28
that’s kind of a broad question.
15:30
And, I was thinking that the role of OSU is to recruit, prepare, and
15:38
retain students and faculty of color.
15:44
It is the “how” to go about doing that is where it gets a little sticky—but um, and
15:54
maybe more debate on how to go about that.
15:58
But I do see that role.
16:00
Okay.
16:01
So then what do you see as your role in supporting your faculty and staff,
16:06
colleagues, and students of color?
16:09
I would say to prepare and retain students.
16:14
And then to support my colleagues who are faculty of color.
16:22
What recommendations do you have for OSU to become a more inclusive campus?
16:27
Please reflect the season of change the university is currently in and
16:31
where you see the university heading.
16:38
Could we pause?
16:38
Yes.
16:38
Okay, sorry, it’s kind of a long one.
16:39
So, what recommendations do you have for Oregon State to
16:42
become a more inclusive campus?
16:44
Let’s just start with that.
16:45
Okay.
16:46
That question was another one I thought, you know, I really
16:50
need to give this some thought.
16:52
And not that my response would be something that could easily happen, but
17:01
I did think about, maybe, the creation of a task force that would be dedicated
17:08
to recruit, grow, and monitor students of color or groups of color that would
17:17
be more or less than 5% of whatever the population is or the enrollment.
17:27
To include faculty and staff, to--and use of current faculty and staff to
17:37
include their skills and knowledge
17:42
to be able to do something like this.
17:45
So, basically reaching out to other faculty and staff of color
17:50
and recognizing that what they are already presenting for campus.
18:02
And then, recruitment of other faculty of color as well as students.
18:08
And then of course, which is always a big one, is retaining--retention is huge.
18:14
So.
18:18
What are some issues of importance that respect, with respect to people
18:23
of color that the community is facing, beyond the local community
18:30
in the state?
18:31
I think I would go so far as to—because this, again, is a very
18:38
broad kind of topic-- and um, I would think number one is financial.
18:46
So, that is always a topic of conversation, definitely in
18:53
the black community as well as other communities of color.
18:58
But financial, when we’re talking about savings and retirement, I know it’s a
19:03
part of the discussion not all of the community can focus on those things,
19:11
which is huge as far as what your future is gonna look like--as well as
19:16
quality health care, race relations, and not necessarily in that order.
19:21
But, I think those are, those are the big topics within the community.
19:33
How did you get started working in Educational Opportunities Program?
19:38
Well, I applied for an office coordinator position.
19:44
I was interviewed with approximately 18
19:50
people in that meeting, in that interview, and,
19:59
to my surprise, I actually got the job, but I was scared out of my wits [laughter]
20:06
. Was this after--you said you came back in’94, correct?
20:10
Was that how soon after you moved back did you decide to search
20:16
for a job here at the school?
20:17
Yes, yes.
20:18
Actually when I initially came back to the area, I worked for the
20:22
Benton County Health Department for a couple months, for a few months.
20:27
And--but during that time, I was applying on campus because that was where my,
20:37
that was my main goal, was to get back on campus and to be able to really get close,
20:45
get more into the academic side of campus.
20:52
But, I needed to get my foot in the door.
20:56
Have there been any special influences to get you where you are now?
21:02
Uh yes, I would say so.
21:06
Um,
21:09
special influences.
21:12
I would say just, you know, the people who support me, the timing
21:22
of different events that statewide, state-wise as well as in the city.
21:32
So um, yeah.
21:35
I would say so.
21:37
Are there ways you would like to expand the program or changes you
21:41
would like to see in the future?
21:43
Hm, expand the program.
21:50
Yeah, I believe so.
21:52
I think, possibly, have a more centralized component of diversity access to
22:03
first-year, sophomore, junior, you know, those types of initiatives and
22:11
having the core of that be academic counselling.
22:17
Have there been any one thing that you think the program
22:20
has been most successful at?
22:24
I think the program has been successful in a number of ways.
22:29
But,
22:33
if I can only choose one thing, I would have to say, it’s been mostly
22:41
successful in providing the highest quality of academic support for students.
22:53
How do students get involved, like in your own words, like how would
22:55
you describe what your program does?
22:58
Like, we can look it up online--but, I mean, and we have--but, how would you
23:01
explain the importance and the meaning and the reasoning of the program for students?
23:07
Okay, those are a lot of different questions that rolled in there.
23:12
What do you think the main purpose of the program is for students?
23:18
Okay.
23:18
The main purpose really is to provide academic support.
23:23
We’re an academic unit, and we provide support to students
23:29
who apply to the program.
23:33
We provide, kind of,
23:38
support to students in general, the university students.
23:44
But for students in the program, we have dedicated a few sections of
23:52
courses as well as, again, the core of our program is academic counselling.
23:58
And, that is more of a high touch with our students in the program where we meet with
24:04
them more often than when a student is in a certain major and normally you meet
24:13
with your major advisor maybe once a term.
24:16
And, I—right now, there are some initiatives that are in place to,
24:21
kind of, change that a little bit.
24:25
And, depending what college, what department, that sort of thing,
24:30
is it would depend on how often a student actually still meets
24:35
with their academic advisor.
24:40
What would you say is the most difficult part of your job?
24:45
I would say the most difficult really is not being able to assist more students
24:56
because there are a lot of students out there who could benefit from the
25:00
program, but the program has a capacity.
25:05
And so, that’s the most, I would say, challenging for
25:15
the program is just not being able to reach as many
25:18
students as we would like to.
25:22
And are there any other topics you’d like to discuss that we
25:25
haven’t already brought up?
25:27
I wouldn’t say topics, but I would
25:34
talk about what our overall goal is.
25:38
And, our overall goal at the program is really to help
25:42
students to reach their goal.
25:46
So we don’t tell a student what their goal is, but we do support them in
25:52
what they identify as their goal.
25:56
And sometimes that goal may change, and that’s one of the beauties of being in the
26:01
program, is if a goal or a major changes, then you may need to change colleges
26:12
or you may need to change advisors--the beauty about being in the program
26:17
is that once you’re in the program, then you’re in until you graduate.
26:21
And so, that remains a constant for the students.
26:24
So, at least there’s that piece even if the student is not
26:28
absolutely sure what their end-goal
26:35
is.
26:36
So, what were, or are, some of your challenges and how do
26:40
you strive to overcome them?
26:42
My challenges, hm.
26:52
Time.
26:54
Time is my biggest challenge.
26:57
There never seems to be enough of it.
27:04
Saying that, you know, when I--when I started advising--or yeah, I
27:11
started as an advisor and then later became academic counsellor--time
27:18
management was always huge for me.
27:22
And so, when I went back to school to get my Master’s degree in, in higher ed.,
27:30
higher ed.
27:31
leadership, I really wanted to focus it on time management.
27:36
And, time management for me is just core.
27:41
Everything that you do, it may be more in some areas and less
27:46
in others, but that became, like, my focus for everything I do.
27:52
So, even as a director and as an academic counsellor, my students will
27:58
tell you that’s the first place I go, is I want to find out what your time
28:05
management looks like because I just think it’s key to everything that we do.
28:09
And if we—if people, and I know there are a lot of people like
28:16
me who are multitaskers, and if you are a multitasker, then you
28:23
must be, kind of, in charge of what your time is gonna look like.
28:30
So yeah [laughter]
28:39
. What do you see as some of your greatest accomplishments?
28:46
After my family, of course—I have two boys, two young men now.
28:54
But as far as a professional accomplishment, initially it was
29:02
when I decided to join the military, and to get through basic training
29:06
was definitely an accomplishment.
29:09
But after, since then, I also went back and completed my degrees,
29:15
as well, as an adult person.
29:19
So, those for me are definitely achievements.
29:26
Each time I help a student and I realize that the student got an “ah-ha” moment,
29:36
for me, that’s another success for me.
29:42
So--and it’s on-going as far as I’m concerned.
29:46
It makes me really happy when a student has reached their goal,
29:55
especially their academic goal.
29:57
And sometimes we set many of those academic goals, and each
30:02
time we get one, we celebrate it.
30:06
And, for OSU, and because we work at EOP mainly with undergraduate
30:13
school, undergraduate students, then it’s important for that goal to be
30:19
to graduate from OSU with a degree.
30:24
You were saying that you went back to school to get your degrees
30:27
after you finished the military.
30:29
So how long were you in the military for and where did you
30:33
end up getting your degree from?
30:35
Well, I was in the military for eight years.
30:38
And so, four of those were active duty, traveling around.
30:42
Another two was being a reservist.
30:46
And the last two was being a reservist but not active, being ready to be
30:54
called up if I needed to--so that’s what those, the last two are.
31:00
Repeat the question again, sorry.
31:01
Where did you receive your degree from after you finished in the military; ‘cuz
31:06
you said you were in Washington D.C. for a while, you met your husband there, right?
31:09
I was.
31:09
Okay, so then did you come back here for school or…?
31:12
I did.
31:14
It was once I was here.
31:17
And I kept—I was taking classes here and there all along, but,
31:22
again, when you have a family, you have to be a little more creative.
31:29
And, at
31:29
the time, I had a young son and my husband and later when I came back,
31:36
then, I had two younger sons and my husband and I. So, being very creative
31:45
in the sense of how do we make this work where our sons don’t have to
31:53
actually pay for mom not completing the education at an earlier time?
32:02
And when I’m talking to my students a lot of times, that will also come out
32:06
because I really encourage my students, if at all possible, finish on this time
32:15
and not take the break and then say, “Oh, I’ll do it later.” Because it’s possible
32:23
to do it later, I’m certainly a witness to that, but it’s also harder when you
32:31
have other people who are counting on you, and someone, you know, other than
32:39
just yourself. So, it just becomes a little more—it’s definitely doable—but
32:45
it becomes a different kind of challenge.
32:49
And so, that’s what I did.
32:51
So, I finished up my Bachelor’s degree in business and then I came back to
32:57
finish a Master’s degree in education.
33:02
Cool.
33:05
Is there anything else that we haven’t discussed that you would like to add
33:08
or share information regarding anything that we have already discussed?
33:14
Hm.
33:16
Let me take a look at that just for a moment.
33:19
Okay.
33:32
I will talk just a little bit, just mention there was a piece on there
33:38
where you were asking to reflect on a season of change at the university.
33:45
And I had thought about that just a little bit because since my tenure here from
33:53
the late ‘80s until now, it has changed quite a bit as far as the infrastructure
34:01
of campus and what it looks like.
34:05
And so,
34:10
when I saw that question, it was broad in the sense of, wow, you
34:15
know, how would I answer that?
34:17
And so, then I started to think about, you know, the changing physically in
34:23
the sense of the amount of buildings that are here where it used to be more
34:29
parks and trees and that sort of thing.
34:33
And I thought, that was very different for me, and I had to ask myself sort of that
34:40
question of, is this a good thing or not?
34:44
And, you know, there’s always a silver lining to everything, and the positive
34:49
that—my positive take away is we are in a historic area, and so when they
34:58
are creating a building, these new buildings, they have to keep that in mind.
35:03
And so, the new buildings and structures that they have added to campus has not
35:10
necessarily taken away from the beauty of campus, they’ve, kind of, stayed within
35:18
the parameters of the historic district.
35:22
And, when I first moved here, one of the things that I loved so about OSU was
35:27
how it reminded me a lot of the old Ivy League kind of schools on the East coast
35:34
that I had been accustomed to seeing.
35:36
And, it’s just, you know, structurally it’s just a beautiful campus.
35:44
Cool.
35:45
So
35:48
I kind of have a question a little back, jumping towards the EOP programs.
35:52
So it seems to me, after working with students for, continuously,
35:55
for four years that you build, like, very good relationships with them.
35:59
Do you have students come back after they’ve graduated and kind
36:02
of, like, share their success stories with you and revisit?
36:06
Yes.
36:06
Is it always nice?
36:07
I feel like it’d be really nice to always see them come back.
36:08
Always.
36:08
Oh, it’s always nice.
36:12
You never get tired of seeing, you know, those faces come back.
36:16
For one, it’s always nice to see a familiar face.
36:20
So, and I think that’s just human nature.
36:22
But, it’s always nice to see how students have grown from their education because
36:31
education is important, and each time I hear a story—and it doesn’t have
36:36
to be elaborate to the point of, you know, that they’re, you know, moving
36:42
the world in some, in some certain way.
36:46
But, whatever their goal was, and if that’s to support their
36:51
family, then that’s wonderful too.
36:56
If it’s to go out and work in the community in a certain way, and their
36:59
able to do that because of their education at OSU and if I had some small part to
37:06
do with that, I mean, it’s just, yeah.
37:09
It’s wonderful.
37:12
Yeah, I could imagine.
37:13
Yeah, it
37:18
is.
37:18
Well, okay.
37:18
Thank you so much.
37:20
You’re welcome, thank you.
