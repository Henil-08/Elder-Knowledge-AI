00:03
Our names are Jessica Tafoya and Emily Boyd.
00:07
We are students in Oregon State University’s U-Engage class, “Untold
00:11
Stories, People of Color in Oregon.” Today’s date is November 14th
00:15
2014, and we are conducting an oral history interview with Urmila Mali.
00:22
Please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:24
So my name is Urmila Mali, it’s U-R-M-I-L-A, and my last name is M-A-L-I.
00:32
What is your birthdate and birthplace?
00:34
My birthdate is November 3rd, 1969 and birthplace is Kathmandu, Nepal.
00:42
With which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
00:45
So I am--depending on who I’m
00:49
talking to, so I’ll normally say Asian, but my ethnicity is Napoli and my
00:56
background is Newari, which is my mother tongue as well.
01:02
When and where were your parents born, and what are their backgrounds?
01:06
So, my mom and dad both are Newari, they were both born in Kathmandu, Nepal.
01:12
My dad was born in late ‘20s, and my mom was born in late ‘30s.
01:19
Where did you grow up and where were you raised?
01:21
So, I was born in Nepal, but I was raised in Tillamook, Oregon.
01:26
So, I moved here in U.S. in 1979 and started school in Tillamook starting
01:33
4th grade and graduated from there.
01:37
What was your transition from high school to college?
01:41
For me the transition was, I was actually looking forward to coming to
01:45
OSU because, being in Tillamook, which was very white farming town, small, I
01:54
was ready to leave because of the some of the racism I experienced there.
01:59
So coming to OSU was like a--I just looked forward to it; it was a huge change.
02:08
Diversity in terms of international students, which I related to
02:12
at that time because I came in as an international student.
02:14
So, for me, it was a great transition.
02:18
So you attended school here at Oregon State, what did you study?
02:22
I--my undergrad was in broadcast communication and my Masters was
02:28
in MAIS, which is, Masters of Art in Interdisciplinary Studies with
02:32
focus in anthropology, women studies.
02:36
That’s awesome.
02:37
Thanks.
02:38
Who
02:40
were or who are your mentors, personal mentors and professional mentors?
02:46
Personally, I would say, I have a large family so my sisters--five
02:51
of my sisters and my brother.
02:55
Professionally, I would say,
03:00
recent are my coworkers from EOP, which includes Janet, Marilyn,
03:06
Janet Nishihara and Marilyn Stewart.
03:08
And then while going to school, it would be Dr. Lani Roberts Dr.
03:13
Janet Lee were some of my mentors and people that I looked up to.
03:24
So, what year did you come to OSU, and what was one of the
03:28
biggest reasons why you came?
03:30
I came to OSU in 1987.
03:34
The two biggest reasons would be, first, my sister was going to school
03:38
here, so I just followed her footstep.
03:41
The other was I had a full ride tuition, everything paid for,
03:47
so I couldn’t argue with that.
03:50
Why not?
03:53
[laughter]
03:53
What were your first impressions of the University and of the Corvallis community?
04:00
So, during--when I came, I, as an undergrad, I didn’t really
04:05
venture out to the community.
04:07
And, as you can imagine in 1987, the town was nothing near what we have here
04:13
in terms of, you know, the restaurants to shopping areas and all, so we really
04:19
stayed within the campus and then maybe ventured out into Monroe.
04:24
But, in terms of the campus, and again, at that time, I thought it was really
04:30
large, but comparison to now, it was, you would say, it was a very small--you
04:35
know, under 10,000 student population.
04:38
So for me, living on campus, I really connected with
04:46
students, very diverse student population.
04:49
So that was my--coming from Tillamook where there wasn’t as many students
04:55
of color or community of color, so that was my thing when I came in
05:01
here was making that connection.
05:03
So I really got involved with international student organizations as
05:07
well as really making sure as I’m picking roommates and all, that it was somebody
05:12
of color because that’s where I gravitated towards after being in Tillamook from
05:18
1979 to ‘87, that’s what I was missing.
05:24
So, you came to OSU in ‘87, and have you been here since then, or
05:30
how long have you been with OSU?
05:32
I have.
05:33
I did my undergrad; it took me a little over four years and
05:36
right after that I, you know.
05:38
And then within a Christmas break, I decided that I wanted
05:44
to do my Masters, which is not a recommended thing for anybody.
05:48
So that’s when I decided to go ahead and apply for Masters.
05:51
And then, so soon as I finish my fall, my last course in fall for
05:56
undergrad, then I just went in, transitioned into my Master’s program.
06:00
And part of the reason for that was because I was an--as an undergrad
06:04
international student, so, soon as I had finished my undergrad, I would
06:09
have had 90, three months to being able to stay within U.S. to see if I
06:15
could find internship and then change my visa into work status visa and
06:21
then--but because, even though I was international student, I grew up here.
06:26
So even though I had my cultural heritage, I was still, you now,
06:31
brought up with the western
06:35
teachings and, you know, my lifestyle and all of that was, I would say,
06:41
forty percent, you know, keeping up with my cultures and all of
06:45
that, but sixty percent of what any normal western, you know, kid
06:50
growing up in this society would do.
06:52
So I wasn’t sure because all of my family was here, so going home and
06:59
not knowing how I would start there.
07:01
So I just transitioned into--again, it was like a last minute spur-of-the-moment
07:06
of wanting to do my grad work.
07:07
And, as I said, I wouldn’t recommend that to anybody, but I had the connections and
07:12
contacts such as Lani Roberts, Janet, you know, Janet as well as Doctor Lee who were
07:19
there to really assist me in being able to process the paperwork and start my Masters
07:26
within, you know, within a few weeks.
07:32
What is your current position?
07:34
Currently I am a co-acting director for Educational Opportunities Program,
07:39
but, and that will be for a year, and then I will transition back into my
07:45
academic counseling position with EOP.
07:49
Have you held any other positions within
07:53
OSU?
07:53
Professionally, I have been with EOP since 1995 as a graduate student for a
07:59
year, and then as a professional staff.
08:03
But other jobs as a GTA, I have worked with women’s studies and then
08:09
as well as EOP and with Housing.
08:14
Please describe your job duties.
08:17
So, as an academic counselor within EOP, we work with non-traditional students,
08:24
which it captures under the umbrella of students of color, low income,
08:29
single parents, so it’s a wide gamut that fits under the non-traditional.
08:33
So for us, when students come into campus and they feel like they can
08:38
benefit from our program, they join our program and for the first year,
08:42
at least for the first term, they’re required to meet with us every other
08:46
week for the academic counseling portion.
08:48
So we work with them in helping students navigate really the, you know,
08:52
the university system anywhere from being aware of the resources that’s
08:58
available for the students, to how do you manage your time, you know, giving
09:03
them the skills and resources that they need to be able to build that solid
09:08
foundation, you know, for the first term.
09:11
So we are--and really holding them accountable too.
09:13
So, talking to them from, you know, why aren’t you going to classes, what
09:17
are things that’s preventing you from doing well in this class, and how can
09:21
we find resources so you’re successful.
09:24
So we’re meeting with students on a regular basis and talking about, besides
09:28
academic, you know, what are other things that may influence or affect in you not
09:33
being a successful student on campus?
09:37
So you’ve mentioned a few people that are important to you here at
09:41
OSU, who are a few more in terms of your work and your position?
09:47
I
09:50
think for EOP it’s a very unique office in terms of, I think, our office is probably
09:56
more diverse than most of the offices.
09:58
So we have, you know, majority of faculty of color that works there, and
10:03
so it’s been a really great support within that unit—so, being able to
10:10
work together, being able to just--
10:15
the word’s going blank on me - but, if you’re needing to vent, if you
10:18
need to just brainstorm, and being able to have that support so you’re
10:22
not feeling like you’re the only person of color in that office and
10:27
feel like you don’t have that support.
10:29
So it’s really—and being that I’ve been there since 1995, that’s been
10:35
my, I guess, a rock I would say.
10:37
And being able to, you know, know that they have my back and they’ll support me
10:42
as well as I support them as well, and having that safe space to being able to
10:47
talk about different topics and different issues that comes across, and know that
10:53
it stays within those walls, and being able to help one-another and support.
10:57
So, I would say that’s been my biggest in terms of my work.
11:01
But also, on campus I build a relationship with different offices
11:05
and different staff and faculty.
11:06
So know that, you know, they’re just a phone call away in terms of
11:11
talking or interacting or just getting support, you know--and different
11:15
levels of support that you need.
11:17
And I know that I’ve built enough relationships to being able to do that.
11:20
How
11:24
have you seen the OSU community change over time in terms
11:28
of diversity and inclusion?
11:33
I think, since I’ve been here since 1995, 1987, excuse me, I think at that time--I
11:41
think that OSU has come a long way since then because, at that time, it was the
11:46
start of, you know, in the early 90’s was when they just started the APCC,
11:52
Asian Pacific Cultural Center, and some of the other initiative that was coming.
11:56
So, and in terms of resources too, I would say there was very limited
12:01
resources in terms of for students.
12:04
So what that means is, for example, for math.
12:08
If you’re taking math class during that time, the only help sessions you would
12:12
have is within the math lab in Kidder, and that’s when you would go for help.
12:16
So that, if you just translate that into now, what, 20 some years later, you know,
12:22
there was different, like, instructional, supplemental instruction, the tutoring
12:27
that’s available within cultural centers as well as in the library.
12:31
So, just the services themselves, I think, has, you know, times
12:35
a hundred I would say, in terms of what’s provided for students.
12:40
And, I think the opportunities that students have; I think there’s more
12:44
opportunities for students to be able to be involved on campus--as I said,
12:48
you know, there’s seven cultural centers that’s available for students now.
12:52
And, I think in terms of services, I think there’s a lot more, and it’s a
12:56
lot more--students are more aware of it compared to when I was a student.
13:03
Are there any events, initiatives, or programs that particularly stand out to
13:08
you when you think about the Corvallis community and the OSU community as
13:13
it’s changed over time with diversity?
13:17
So, when I was a, when I was a student,
13:22
you know, there was a couple racial incident that took place
13:25
that occurred on campus, which
13:29
created an office.
13:31
And because of the student voice and meetings and demonstrations that
13:34
brought on the office, at that time it was Minority Education Office,
13:39
which is now ISS, so that was a huge, you know, change that students
13:45
were able to bring up on the campus.
13:47
And I think--and then as well as the start of the various other cultural
13:54
centers, I think that has been--and I think one of things that shows is with,
13:59
you know, students coming together and having that voice and giving that voice
14:07
and talking to the administrators, that the changes have come through.
14:10
So as a student, I think that--and as a start of my, you know, career that was, I
14:17
would say, was, like, a huge initiative.
14:19
And I think that, that has created, in terms of having that voice for
14:25
students--and as you can, you know, see, there’s different initiatives that’s
14:29
coming across, and I think a lot of that has contributed to, you know, students
14:34
working together and students voicing those concerns in what is needed for
14:39
them to be supported on campus as well as supported within classrooms and being
14:44
able to have administrators that are actually, not only listening to them, but
14:49
actually hearing and making those changes.
14:53
What do you see as the OSU’s role supporting faculty and staff of
14:57
color as well as students of color?
15:00
So, with OSU, you know, as we hear constantly, we are on
15:09
the steps of recruiting more diverse students of color or as
15:13
well as faculty of color on campus.
15:15
So I think part of it is, while we’re recruiting them, we really need to be
15:20
able to provide that safe, positive, and nurturing environment because I think,
15:27
being here for so long, I think one of the things I’ve noticed, you know,
15:31
Corvallis is very unique place of its own.
15:34
And then within that, the Corvallis, the OSU community is unique in and of its own.
15:41
So, when you’re bringing in faculty of color and students, you know,
15:46
they’re coming, but then there isn’t that, particularly for faculties
15:50
of color, there isn’t that place for them to interact and meet other
15:55
faculties of color and then being able to know that I’m not the only one.
15:59
And, most of the time, that’s what it is, they’re the only ones in that unit that
16:03
looks like them or, you know, and they’re coming from big cities or different
16:07
place, so it’s a very shock once you’re here and spend time because Corvallis
16:11
is, I think, a very family centered town.
16:15
So I think as a university and as administrators within those units,
16:23
need to take a responsibility in making sure that they’re being connected
16:26
to other staff, other people, who can support them and mentor them.
16:32
And then, same thing with students too because, I think, it needs to
16:35
be, you know, not only recruiting.
16:37
The students may be coming here because of a lot of the innovative things that
16:41
our university is doing, but being able to provide the resources, the mentoring,
16:49
and the services for the students so that they’re successful as all.
16:53
Because, again not just recruiting them and bringing them on campus, and
16:57
once they’re here, you know, then what?
17:00
So you may have said all the great and wonderful things to faculty and students
17:05
while they’re recruiting, but once you're here, are you following through on all of
17:10
the things that you were saying and what responsibility are we taking in making
17:13
sure that they're staying and that they’re not feeling like they are by themselves?
17:18
So, being able to really provide that nurturing environment
17:21
so they’re flourishing.
17:24
What do you see as your role in supporting faculty, staff, and students of color?
17:30
So, I would say, I think for me, as my role as I'm meeting faculties,
17:37
providing that space where they can come in and talk, providing that,
17:42
whatever role they see me --whether as a mentor, as a friend, as a colleague.
17:47
So for me, really being able to say, “I'm here if you need to talk,” you know,
17:51
reaching out, and then just being able to have that space where they can talk and
17:56
know that, you know, if you’re frustrated, if you just need to vent, or you just
18:02
need to share ideas, that I’m here, it’s confidential, and that, you know,
18:08
you have a friend or colleague that’s going to be here for you to support you.
18:12
For students--and we work with quite a few students of color too—is, same thing.
18:17
But, you know, being able to know that you are in an environment that’s
18:21
safe, so I’m there to support you.
18:23
And now, I may, you know, ask you questions and whatnot, but at the
18:31
end of it, that you have someone who’s going to support you and be
18:34
able to connect you to the resources.
18:37
And, I think, that’s the most important thing, whether you’re
18:40
a faculty of color or students of color that’s what you want to know.
18:43
It’s like, you know, is there some place I can go where I feel safe, where I can feel
18:47
like I’m being heard, and then is there somebody who’s gonna help me connect me to
18:52
the resources that is available on campus?
18:57
In addition to the nurturing environment, are there any
19:02
recommendations that you have for OSU to become a more inclusive campus?
19:10
Well, as our OSU mission states, that, you know, we are, we value diversity, right.
19:17
So I think—and OSU, I think, has started, just recently I'm thinking
19:21
about, started on the road of demonstrating campus inclusivity,
19:26
for example of the Halsell Hall, which has a gender inclusive housing.
19:31
And I think in order to be
19:35
more inclusive on campus, you know, they have created, like, gender, women and
19:42
gender equity office, office of community and diversity, creating faculty diversity.
19:48
So I think moving beyond that is of saying, okay, we’ve created these
19:53
offices, what, continue to take those steps in making those changes because I
19:58
think--and the only way I can describe that is saying walking your talk, right?
20:03
Because being able to not only create these offices, but what
20:08
is it that we’re doing next.
20:10
So, being really transparent about the steps we’re taking to make these changes
20:15
because I think, a lot of times, we have -- when incident occurs or something
20:21
happens, you know, we talk about, we all get together and we talk about these are
20:26
the things we need to put in places, these are the initiatives we’re gonna start.
20:29
But after that, it feels like, just, that’s where it is, right.
20:34
So, being able to really say, okay these are the things, changes that’s happening.
20:39
And then, I think for students, having that where it’s very transparent is
20:44
going to show that okay, university cares about me, these are the steps that’s
20:48
going on—taking place, and these are the things that is how we’re moving forward.
20:53
And I think that’s really important in showing that, not just saying we’re, you
20:57
know, inclusive campus or a community, but now being—and then putting these
21:03
initiatives in place but now, what is it, what’s the next step we’re taking.
21:09
And where do you see that next step going?
21:13
Ah, I
21:16
think, again, you know, the university is doing great job in providing the support
21:22
and providing the resources and then recruiting all students, but students
21:28
of color as well as faculty of color.
21:30
So I think next step for me I see as really continue to build on that.
21:36
You know, what does that mean in terms of when students are on campus and how
21:41
are we really demonstrating that we’re inclusive, how are we showing, whether
21:48
within classroom, housing, offices?
21:51
So if a student just goes to an office to ask a question, is that
21:55
person being inclusive in terms of the way their--simple as were they
22:01
greeted, to the way they’re, you know, their questions being heard.
22:05
So,
22:08
part of that is, I think I would say, training, right, within offices
22:13
and departments and programs.
22:14
Part of it is really saying, again, you know, yes we’re saying that we’re
22:19
inclusive, but continue to doing more in demonstrating that because, I think,
22:26
we can’t just do one thing of saying, okay we’re gender inclusive housing in
22:31
Halsell, but so, what’s the next step and how does that look and who buy-in
22:37
from all university faculties and staff.
22:41
Because, again, it’s not just about Housing’s responsibility or it’s
22:44
not just about EOP’s responsibility or, you know, a certain office or
22:48
a space, but over all of do all
22:54
OSU’s staff employees understand what that means and what part am I taking
23:00
in demonstrating that this campus is inclusive of all students and all staff.
23:07
So I think the next step would be in making sure that there’s
23:11
a buy-in from everybody.
23:16
What are some of the issues of importance with respect to people of
23:19
color that the community is facing?
23:31
I think biggest part I would say is, um, the type of support
23:37
their getting on campus.
23:39
So again, I think it goes back to, you know, there are certain offices, certain
23:43
programs that students of color feel comfortable and safe going knowing that,
23:50
you know, I can go to EOP or I can go to cultural centers, ISS--and I know
23:55
there’s many other offices where they may feel comfortable going and getting
24:00
the support and the resources they need.
24:03
And I think part of it is, I think, for students, really feeling
24:09
that support, and support that they need, so they’re able to be
24:15
successful—a successful student on campus because I think part of it is,
24:20
you know, if we’re not providing that support, it’s gonna affect students
24:23
in terms of how their performing in classroom as is outside of classroom.
24:29
So,
24:33
because I think there’s different issues in all that plays into, but
24:36
I think the important part when students come in, I would say is what
24:40
kind of support are we providing?
24:42
And, you know, and again, being really aware of are we welcoming?
24:46
Because sometimes students feel, when they go to particular offices,
24:49
particular departments, they don’t feel welcome.
24:51
So again, looking at our individuals behaviors of how we are treating that
24:55
student and talking to that student or, and how we’re providing that and what
25:02
message are we giving that student.
25:06
So I see that you’ve done some work with the Nepalese Association of
25:09
Oregon and was wondering if you could maybe talk about what that is and
25:14
what kind of work you do with them?
25:16
So, Nepali
25:19
Association of Oregon, it was created--and I was actually in, when we first created
25:26
that association a while back, I was part of that because when we first, actually,
25:31
when we first came, my family came, we, there was a very, like a, less than 25
25:38
people in the community within Portland.
25:43
And so, when there was a cultural get-together and gatherings, we could
25:47
do at somebody’s home in Portland.
25:50
But, as the community grew--whether it’s students coming to universities
25:54
or community members coming for jobs--so the community grew really
25:59
large so it was impossible to have one home host these events.
26:03
So, and events are from, you know, our New Year’s celebrations to the
26:09
different celebrations that we have.
26:11
So, that is why—one of the reasons why—we’re like, let’s create a
26:15
Nepalese Association of Oregon.
26:17
And that is, basically, of, you know, it’s a membership base.
26:22
And we create, we, association organizes three different events in
26:29
a year—so it’s a summer picnic, we do some cultural events and shows,
26:35
and then couple different celebration events during fall term, fall term.
26:41
And then--so part of it is really a place for community members to come together
26:47
and gather as well as one of the things we’ve been really been able to do is
26:53
in month of November--end of month right after Thanksgiving--we bring all
26:58
of the high school students together, Nepalese high school students together.
27:02
And then really talk to them about process of applying for college—what
27:07
are the expectations of being a college students, you know, talking
27:11
about financial aid, to applying for scholarships, to really what is it that
27:17
you would be expected to do in college.
27:21
And then we also created a scholarship for, to give to
27:25
one of the graduating seniors.
27:28
So it’s been really great in terms of—also if there’s other Nepalese
27:31
students that are planning to come to Oregon, they’re able to find us through
27:36
this association and be able to make connections so that we’re able to, from
27:42
hosting a student or a community member for a few days until they find housing
27:46
to being able to provide some of the resources that’s available in Oregon.
27:52
So, yeah, so it’s been a great association, and it’s growing.
27:55
I think we have over 500 community members.
27:58
And then, we also make connections with the association in Washington as well as
28:04
Vancouver, Canada, and, once a year, one of us takes turn hosting a summer event.
28:14
What did Color of Fear look like back in May of 1996?
28:19
And, um, how has that impacted OSU since?
28:23
So, Color of Fear at that time, I think,
28:30
the documentary--and then, I know Lee Mun Wah who was a creator of
28:35
this had come on campus at that time.
28:39
Even though, you know, we talk about the issues
28:44
of racism and what everybody, you know, individuals are experiencing, this
28:49
really, I think, kind of, at that time, opened an awareness for a lot of the OSU
28:55
community members because I think, you know, just, being able to watch that video
29:02
where there was five gentlemen who were talking about their experience, right.
29:06
And actually, it was a retreat that they had gone through with him—having
29:10
him come here to do that, showing us that documentary, and then being able
29:15
to then actually hear community members, and then OSU community members--whether
29:22
they’re students or faculty--sharing their experience, I think, it just really
29:26
brings it home for a lot of the people.
29:29
Because, I think, sometimes, you know, you may watch a documentary and most
29:34
of the people are from back East or whatnot, so you can’t really personalize
29:37
it or being aware, like you know, something like this is happening in
29:41
Corvallis, you know, students and faculty are experiencing racism, prejudice.
29:48
So this, at that time, really, I think, opened up a lot of eyes and opened up
29:56
doors in seeing that this is what’s going on within our community and not saying
30:01
that, you know, no that’s not happening.
30:03
You know, we have a very safe, welcoming environment—but it was happening.
30:07
So, I think this really brought in the light of being able to say
30:11
that, you know, there’s racism in Corvallis, there’s racism within
30:15
OSU, but how, what do we do in the moving forward in dealing with that?
30:21
So I think that if it is brought in now, I think it will be very different
30:27
versus then because, at that time, we had it in the MU, you know MU ballroom.
30:33
And then, there was a group of us who was able to do some workshop,
30:38
personal workshop, with him--a few of us faculties of color.
30:44
Again, it’s really about unpacking, you know.
30:46
Because for faculties being able to unpack the experiences they’ve
30:51
had, and then being able to
30:58
move forward so that we’re able to make positive impacts with students
31:03
who are experiencing that as well.
31:07
What were some of your challenges and how did you strive to overcome them?
31:13
So, when I first started working, my biggest challenge was being the
31:19
youngest in the meetings--and you know,
31:25
whether its committees that I’m a part of or in meeting.
31:28
So being able to be there as one of the younger faculty, among faculty who
31:36
are tenure-track or who’ve been there for long time who, maybe, are set in
31:40
their ways of their beliefs or ways they think they should be doing things.
31:45
So that was the biggest challenge of being heard, I think, and again,
31:51
part of it is where I learned.
31:53
And how to move beyond that was, you know, sitting, listening, lot
31:57
of times just listening and taking notes, and then slowly interjecting,
32:02
you know, sentence or two.
32:04
Not coming across like I know it all, but really being able to show
32:07
that I may be young, but there’s some ideas and some things that
32:12
I can contribute to this meeting.
32:13
So I think that was the biggest challenge then.
32:17
And now, I think, sometimes some of the challenges are within meetings and all,
32:23
is, you know, keeping the momentum going.
32:25
Because sometimes we’re so busy with
32:30
committees and meetings and all and we’re juggling so much that sometimes we,
32:35
you know, we forget to really say what are our goals, how do we move forward?
32:40
So I think trying to keeping momentum going, not only for myself
32:45
but as a committee, as a group.
32:47
So, and that’s, sometimes, that’s challenging—and trying to balance it all.
32:53
What would you say are some of your greatest accomplishments?
32:58
I wouldn’t—I think my greatest accomplishments comes in on a daily basis.
33:04
Because, I think, part of it is, you know with students, it’s like even a
33:10
little step that student takes while I meet with students and talk about
33:15
different strategies and different success that you need in order to be
33:19
a successful students, sometimes--you know, as little as when I actually see
33:25
that they’re using time management, for me, that’s a success, you know.
33:30
That’s a great achievement because, again, it’s not at the end of the
33:33
year, end of the term, I’m saying these are my greatest achievements.
33:37
Sometimes a student, you know, we’ve had a conversation—I’ve had a
33:39
conversation with student, and then I get a message saying, “Okay, I got
33:45
it.” So being able to say—to me, those are the greatest accomplishments.
33:53
So, it’s not a one big thing.
33:55
If I have to choose one big thing, then it’s a, you know, student graduating
34:00
and being able to see that they have, you know, reached their goal.
34:04
For me, I think it comes in just small doses.
34:07
There’s weeks where I may feel like, okay did I do anything in contributing and
34:11
making a difference in student’s life?
34:13
But the other times, just a small message or they’re just coming by and saying,
34:18
okay I understand why you keep telling me to use time management or why you keep
34:22
telling me to go see my academic advisor.
34:25
And when they have that “ah-ha” moment--and again, that may come
34:30
end of the term, in two years down the road, or four years down the
34:33
road, but that’s my accomplishment.
34:36
And, recently I actually, not too long ago, I actually got an email from one of
34:41
my students that I taught long time ago and worked with, and she was saying, you
34:47
know, the job that she has now, she’s like, I am so glad I took math as a study
34:51
class with you because everything you taught me, I didn’t use it, you know,
34:55
during that term or during that year, but now I’m recalling it, and I see how this
35:02
is important in the job that I’m doing.
35:04
So again, you know, that’s making a difference, and that’s an accomplishment.
35:11
So, we’re doing really really well on time, so I’m just going to leave
35:15
this last part open to you, if there’s anything that we’ve not discussed
35:20
or something that you want to give more information about regarding
35:24
something we already have discussed?
35:27
You know, I think,
35:31
I would say in terms of — I really believe that in terms of, you know, when
35:36
we’re recruiting faculties of colors or students of color on campus, really
35:40
making sure that we are providing the resource services for, again, students
35:46
to be successful or flourishing.
35:49
Because, I think, again, being here for so long, I have really seen a
35:54
lot of the faculties leave--whether it’s not the right fit or whether
35:59
they’re feeling like they’re not getting the support that they need.
36:03
So, one of the things I think in exit interviews with faculties of color,
36:08
just see, okay what are the reasons you left, what would have kept you here?
36:12
So being able to do that—because I think if we don’t know, we’re not
36:16
going to be able to make the changes.
36:17
We can assume and continue, but I don’t think we’ll be able to make the changes
36:22
that is needed so that we can, you know, be able to, not only just recruit but be
36:29
able to retain these faculties of color.
36:30
Because, again, we’re also recruiting students of color on campus, but if
36:36
there isn’t that connection where we can make, you know, with students--whether
36:41
it’s, again, mentoring or just being able to be in class with faculties
36:44
of color in various different areas of, you know, curriculum--if we don’t
36:50
have that, then it’s not, I think it’s a moot point in saying we have these
36:56
resources but we haven’t done much.
36:59
So again, I bring it back to saying, you know, walking the talk then being
37:03
able to not only say come on over we have this, but then really being
37:07
able to demonstrate how we have this.
37:09
So I think, for me, that is--for me, the resource of providing that
37:14
support and providing that nurturing space for faculties to be able to, and
37:20
students, to be able to flourish, I think that’s really, really important.
37:24
What kind of things have you seen faculty members leave for?
37:29
I think a lot of times, sometimes, it may be just the support
37:33
within, or feeling like I’m the only one within that department.
37:37
Yeah.
37:37
So
37:43
it’s been very important to make sure that you have that support within your office?
37:47
Yeah.
37:48
I think that’s one of the things that keeps me here, having that
37:51
support, and having that foundation that’s set within our program to
37:57
being able to—I mean, most of us, we’ve been, you know, over 20 years.
38:04
This is my 20 years, yeah.
38:06
And I think one other thing has been that support and that
38:12
area where I, you know, I know that I have that support and being able to do my work.
38:17
Because one of the things I’ve always said is, you know, if I get up when
38:22
I wake up and I’m dreading going to work, then it’s time to change.
38:25
And that has always been my rule when I first started my job, you know.
38:29
I said, I never thought I would be here in this job for this long, you know.
38:34
I thought this would be my transition into then going to Portland or a
38:38
bigger city doing something different.
38:40
But so, I kept that as a rule of saying, you know, if I get up in the
38:43
morning—whether it’s a beautiful, sunny day or snowing—and I just wake
38:48
up and I dread—you know, like, God, I don’t want to go to work or I’m really
38:52
dreading, then it’s time to change.
38:54
Because again, that means I’m not going to be affective academic counsellor
38:58
or active director for this program.
39:01
Because, you know, I’m not giving my 110% to
39:06
providing that resources services to students.
39:09
And I share that with students too, saying, you know, then
39:13
it’s time to make changes.
39:14
And I haven’t woken up and said that yet.
39:19
Well, we’re glad you’re here at OSU.
39:22
If you have nothing else to touch on, then I think we can leave it here.
39:27
Yeah, thank you so much.
39:28
Thank you.
