00:00
Our names are Karly Rodgers.
00:02
Hayley Pearson.
00:03
San Pail Whitehead.
00:04
We are students in Oregon State University's U-Engage class, “Untold
00:07
Stories: People of Color in Oregon.” Today's date is November 18th, and
00:12
we are conducting an oral history interview with Janet Nishihara.
00:17
Mhm.
00:17
Okay.
00:18
So, please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:21
Oh, Janet Nishihara.
00:23
J-A-N-E-T N-I-S-H-I-H-A-R-A.
00:28
What is your birthdate and birthplace?
00:30
Birthdate, [EDITED OUT] . Birthplace, Ontario, Oregon.
00:34
With which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
00:38
I identify primarily as a third generation Japanese American and
00:42
more generally as Asian American.
00:44
When and where were your parents born and what are their backgrounds?
00:47
Oh, wow.
00:48
Let's see, my dad was born in 1925 in Utah, and my mom was
00:54
born in 1927 in Eastern Idaho.
00:59
Where did you grow up and where were you raised?
01:02
So I was--I've grew up near Ontario area.
01:05
I said Ontario because that's where the hospital is.
01:08
We actually were raised in a small, near a small town nearby town called Veil.
01:13
So we were about 15, 20 miles outside of Ontario, but really out in the country.
01:21
What was your transition from high school to college?
01:24
Oh, what was my transition from high school to college?
01:27
Um, I really, really wanted to go to college.
01:29
Being in a small town--I liked growing up in a small town--I was, I felt a little,
01:33
um, stifled, or held back by not a whole lot of opportunities in high school.
01:41
In fact, I took like two years of typing, which no one needs
01:44
two years of typing, right?
01:46
I took two years of typing because there wasn’t a whole
01:47
lot of other classes to take.
01:48
Um, if they had A.P., I would have taken A.P. So I felt--when I came to
01:52
college, I thought, okay finally, this is my opportunity to try some different
01:55
things I didn't have a chance to try in high school because they didn't
01:58
have it because it was a small school.
02:00
So I was real excited about coming to college, and also scared because, like I
02:04
said, I grew up outside of a small town.
02:06
So, coming to Corvallis was like, wow, big city, there're stop lights
02:09
here and things like that, and elevators, and stuff that we didn't
02:13
have anywhere near where we grew up.
02:15
I remember when we were kids, wanting to go to Boise so we could ride the
02:18
escalator once in a while in the mall because there weren't any where we were.
02:22
So.
02:23
So yeah, it was scary and exciting at the same time.
02:27
Where did you attend school and what did you study?
02:30
Well, I attended Oregon State University.
02:32
So I came here as a freshman right out of high school and I studied - I
02:37
came in as an English education major and graduated as an English education
02:40
major, so I didn't change my mind along the way and really enjoyed the
02:45
classes and things and the people I met.
02:47
So.
02:50
Who were your mentors, personal and professional?
02:53
During college?
02:54
Mhm.
02:54
Okay.
02:56
One of my mentors was my academic advisor.
02:59
So, he was a very, very interesting guy who would gladly spend a lot of time
03:05
just sitting in his office and talking about whatever we wanted to talk about.
03:08
And I had never really had that before, so that was really cool.
03:12
And, luckily, he was the advisor for my major, so he also
03:15
helped me out at the same time.
03:16
So he was one of my mentors.
03:19
There are other people, a lot of my mentors were upper division
03:22
students, juniors and seniors, who were here when I was a
03:24
freshman--they helped me out a lot too.
03:31
What made you decide to come to Corvallis, to Oregon State?
03:36
You know, [laughing] the main reason I came to Oregon State
03:41
was because my dad told me that I couldn't go to University of Oregon.
03:45
Because in Eastern Oregon is relatively conservative.
03:47
And, at that point especially, in the, like, mid to late ‘70s, U of O
03:52
was seen as very liberal and Oregon State was seen as very conservative.
03:56
Which when I got here it didn't seem that different, but that was
03:58
really the reputation that they had.
04:00
And the reputation in Eastern Oregon was that people that went to U of O were all
04:04
hippies and all smoked pot or something.
04:08
And Oregon State, they were all Cowboys and I guess drank beer.
04:11
I don't know.
04:12
When I go here it just was exciting to me, so that's the main reason
04:16
why I came to Oregon State.
04:17
Because if I were, you know, being logical about something, I
04:20
would have picked a school with maybe a bigger English program.
04:24
But I’m really glad I chose what I did because it means the classes were small,
04:28
we got to know the professors really well.
04:29
So, some of the bigger schools, classes had 75, 80 students in each class.
04:35
We had 20, so it’s a lot better in my mind.
04:40
What is your current position?
04:41
My current position for this year is, I’m the Interim Associate Provost
04:45
for Academic Success and Engagement and Director of Advising on campus.
04:49
And that's just for this year basically; I don't know when
04:52
it's going to end, we'll see.
04:54
It's supposed to end by June, it will probably end before that.
04:56
And, usually I am the Director of the Educational Opportunities Program.
05:01
Have you held other positions with OSU?
05:03
Yeah.
05:04
I started here, well I did my undergrad here, and then I came
05:07
back and did graduate school here.
05:08
So, I’ve been a graduate teaching assistant, I’ve been a writing instructor,
05:14
I've been an academic counselor, I've supervised some other people,
05:18
and I’ve been the director of EOP.
05:20
So, most of my positions have been within EOP.
05:25
So, what are your job duties?
05:27
Wow, right now.
05:28
That's a good question.
05:29
My job duties right now are, it seems like they keep changing, or
05:33
somebody will call me and say, "Hey did you realize you are supposed to
05:36
be doing this?" and I'm like, "No!
05:37
No one told me that part.
05:39
So, okay thanks for letting me know." A big part of my job duties are
05:43
coordinating the work that's going on on campus with the first year experience.
05:47
So, sort of, just keeping all that stuff moving and keeping it going until
05:51
a new person comes into the position because I am just doing it for this year.
05:55
So, first year experience.
05:57
As director of advising, a big part of my job is to make sure we’re still
06:01
moving forward on helping the colleges get better and better in the academic
06:05
advising they provide for students.
06:08
So, a lot of the first-year academic advising, and I also oversee, like, the
06:13
EOP and some of the academic support programs for students--academics
06:16
for student athletes, academic success center, so helping those
06:19
units grow and develop also.
06:22
So those are my main areas.
06:25
Who has been important to you here at OSU in terms of your work and position?
06:29
Oh, well, I think several people.
06:34
Let's see who comes to mind first.
06:36
One person definitely is Dr. Larry Roper who, up until recently, was the
06:40
Vice Provost for Student Affairs at Oregon State because my, one of my
06:46
graduate degrees is in Student Affairs.
06:47
And so, I feel real attached to that unit even though we’re
06:51
not currently in that area.
06:53
Another person is Susie Brubaker Cole.
06:55
She held the position I’m in right now before.
06:58
So I’m, sort of, trying to fill in while she takes on another position.
07:03
There’ve been a lot of people who were, like, directors of the EOP
07:06
before who helped me grow a lot.
07:10
And I mean, some of the professors, a lot of the professors on campus,
07:12
too, that I took classes from.
07:14
So, kind of a lot of people.
07:18
How have you seen the OSU community change over time in
07:21
terms of diversity and inclusion?
07:25
You know, I think, it’s sort of this, sort of two answers to
07:29
that, and one is about students.
07:31
I think we’ve gotten a lot better at recruiting and retaining a
07:36
more diverse student population.
07:37
I think it’s gotten a lot better; it’s way better than it was when I was a freshman
07:40
at Oregon State, in terms of diversity.
07:43
I think we haven't done as good of job with faculty and
07:48
administrators and things like that.
07:50
It's a little bit tougher in some ways.
07:53
Students come here and they're committing to four, five, six years, or whatever it
07:56
is at Oregon State, and if they just can't stand it anymore, then they go find a job
08:00
or go to graduate school someplace else.
08:02
Faculty it's different because they’re committing, basically, to setting up
08:06
their life here, and if the campus and the community don't seem like a good place
08:10
to do that, then why would they stay?
08:12
You know, it’s a difficult thing to do.
08:13
So that’s--I think there is big growth in terms of students because there is
08:17
more support services around and the university has been paying attention to.
08:20
I think their next step is to start paying more attention to the faculty of color.
08:25
And then, what about Corvallis in general in terms of diversity and inclusion?
08:29
How has that expanded?
08:30
Boy.
08:33
I don't know if I have an answer to that.
08:35
I don’t--it's just not a very diverse town.
08:40
It's really easy to, sort of, go around town and not see a whole lot of diversity.
08:44
And I’ve been here for so long, it doesn't bug me, but every once in a
08:46
while, I'll be with somebody, we’ll go to the movie theatre and before the lights
08:50
go down somebody will look around and go, "You’re the only person of color
08:53
in this." And I’m just like, "Really?
08:54
Did you have to bring that to my attention?
08:56
Thanks a lot." So I usually, yeah, I usually don’t pay attention, but
09:00
there’s some situations where I am like, "Wow, okay yeah, I’m in Corvallis."
09:05
And, are there any events, initiatives, programs in particular that stand out for
09:09
diversity and inclusion at Oregon State?
09:11
As being good, or?
09:14
I’m assuming, yeah.
09:15
Yeah, probably good.
09:16
There's a couple of pieces.
09:16
One is
09:19
the Difference, Power, and Discrimination Program.
09:22
You guys may not have heard of yet.
09:25
It’s a part of the BACC core.
09:27
You have to take a course that’s in Difference, Power, and Discrimination
09:30
--that means the course has to cover those areas and has to be based in the U.S. and
09:35
it has to deal with difference, basically.
09:38
And not just, “Oh, like, oh, these people eat different food and these
09:42
people dress differently,” not that sort of level but a deeper level where it's
09:45
like so, “what is the discrimination this group has faced and how they
09:48
dealt with it?” So, having—getting that requirement into the general ed.
09:54
requirements at Oregon State, I think, was a big change on campus
09:58
in terms of making it clear that we mean this across the campus.
10:02
It's not just an ethnic study major who has to understand that, or a women's
10:06
study major who has to understand it, everybody needs to have some
10:09
background in that in order to become a fully-thinking American in a lot of ways.
10:14
So, I think that was a big deal.
10:18
I think the, having—there’s a contract that was signed between the administration
10:27
and the different cultural groups on campus that says that the cultural
10:32
centers are here in perpetuities.
10:35
So, they can’t, the university can’t just say, decide we need that
10:39
land, we need that space, we need that building, and kick people out.
10:43
This contract says that any decisions about the cultural centers themselves,
10:48
the physical location, the physical structure, has to be in agreement
10:51
between the communities involved, and that means on-campus and
10:55
off-campus and the administration.
10:57
So that was a pretty big step, I think.
11:00
And that’s something that Larry Roper was real instrumental in setting up.
11:04
And I think it says a lot; it says a lot to me that the university values it so
11:08
much that they’re willing to say—‘cuz it’s valuable, I mean, any piece of
11:12
land in central campus is valuable land.
11:15
Anybody would want to have their, their building there.
11:17
In fact, where the new Asian Pacific Cultural Center is going in, they claimed
11:22
that spot and then the College of Business said, “Oh but we already drew our plans
11:26
up to have Austin Hall at that spot.” And they said, “Could you ask the students
11:30
again to make sure that’s the spot they want?” And so, we got them together and
11:34
sent out this thing, and they all voted, and yeah, that’s the spot they wanted.
11:37
So now, so Austin had to move further down the hill.
11:40
They’re still gigantic.
11:41
And they’ve been real good neighbors so far.
11:43
I think they’re going to be great neighbors for us.
11:44
But, they could have easily said, “but we’re the college of business, you
11:49
know, we’re central to this campus, we need that spot”—but they didn’t.
11:53
So, I think that’s a good sign also.
11:57
And, what do you see as OSU’s role in supporting faculty and staff of color,
12:02
like just in general like you said before?
12:06
I think their role is to, I don’t know, I’ll have to think about this
12:09
more, but—it’s to, to understand
12:16
the different pressures that are on faculty of color
12:19
when they live here in town.
12:21
Years ago, I was at a search committee interview sort of thing, and they’re
12:25
asking the candidate about—‘cuz there’s a candidate, a person of color—he said,
12:30
“What would you do to make Corvallis a more welcoming community?” He’s like,
12:33
“Well, there’s not much you can do to the town, you can’t make the town do
12:36
certain things.” And they said, “Well, wouldn’t it be better if all the faculty
12:39
of color were required to live in town?” And his response was, “Well, as soon
12:45
as you make all faculty live in town then that might be a requirement, but
12:48
you cannot make certain sub-populations required to live in town when it
12:52
costs more to live in town, this may not be where they want to raise their
12:55
children, all those kinds of things.
12:57
So, how could you make a restriction on a certain group of people and not
13:00
on another?” Which I thought was a good response because that would be, kind
13:04
of, scary if we moved to a place where certain groups were required to do
13:07
certain things that other people weren’t.
13:08
That doesn’t seem very American in a lot of ways.
13:11
Backwards.
13:11
Yeah, it seems to be backwards.
13:13
Um.
13:14
But, I think, I think the administration is getting closer
13:21
to—they still don’t listen to faculty of color very much, I don’t think.
13:25
We don’t have a very strong, unified voice.
13:29
So I think they think, okay everyone’s happy, but they’re
13:32
just not listening I don’t think.
13:34
So, I don’t know.
13:36
I don’t know what the answer to that is.
13:38
And then, what do you see is OSU’s role in supporting students
13:42
of color, in addition to that?
13:43
You know, there was somebody who said, “A rising tide floats all boats.”
13:49
Which okay, I go with that to a certain extent, but that’s—you’re assuming
13:52
that everyone’s boat is equally seaworthy, and everyone’s, you know,
13:56
everyone’s got the same cool stuff on the boat, and all that kind of stuff.
14:00
And I think, just talking with students, I know people come
14:03
from very different backgrounds.
14:04
I was just in a meeting with a student from Union--and Union, I don’t know
14:08
how many people they graduate every year, I think it’s like ten, maybe.
14:12
And like two go to college in a given year.
14:14
So that’s a very different student from a student who goes to Lake Oswego
14:17
High School, or to Sunset High, or something like that with big schools
14:21
with lots of money available to them.
14:23
So the idea of a rising tide which floating all boats--which, I’m assuming,
14:29
means making the whole institution better and more supportive--I don’t know if that
14:35
exactly is the way to go about it because I think there are a lot of students who
14:38
come as first generation students who are really, rurally isolated students who need
14:42
a little bit more support than, sort of, the general support that everybody has.
14:46
I think we do need to raise the general level of support for everybody just
14:48
to make sure that everyone feels like they know what’s going on, and how to
14:52
fit in, and all that kind of stuff.
14:53
But I think there are certain populations that we need to pay special attention to.
14:57
So, sort of both of those things.
15:00
And then, what do you see as your role in supporting your
15:03
faculty of color colleagues?
15:05
Oh, wow.
15:09
I’ve been thinking about this one.
15:11
I don’t know right now.
15:14
I think—‘cuz we used to have a fair—relatively strong organization
15:20
that was faculty of color group.
15:22
And sort of, people got real busy, and it sort of hasn’t been very
15:25
active in the past couple of years.
15:28
And there was a women of color group that got started last year,
15:32
year before, that kind of got going and then everyone got busy.
15:37
We sort of haven’t revisited that.
15:38
And I think that’s the one I want to see if we can revisit because there’s
15:41
a lot of things that women faculty of color, in particular, that might be
15:46
something that we can pull together on.
15:48
So, as long as people wanted to get together and just have food
15:50
and stuff, we had a great time.
15:53
We sort of, just, hung out and talked and tried to get together again.
15:58
But it’s just, it’s just harder than ever, it seems like these days, so.
16:02
So, I don’t know what my role is right now, but I’m thinking of trying to nudge
16:08
people to try to get that going again.
16:10
So, yeah.
16:13
And then, in addition to faculty, the students of color as well.
16:18
Um.
16:20
Huh.
16:21
Right now, my main role with students of color—well, I have a couple—one
16:24
is when I go back to EOP, got a big population, big percentage of the
16:29
population in EOP are students of color.
16:31
But I also do a lot of advising for student organizations.
16:34
So I’m the faculty adviser for the Cambodian students, the
16:37
Hmong students, Asian Pacific American student union--those are
16:43
the three main ones right now.
16:44
Just, sort of—and they run fine on their own, so I just, sort of, show
16:48
up in meetings and show my face and hope they remember who I am.
16:50
And go down to the kitchen, that’s, I’m hoping the new kitchen, I can
16:54
cook down there, that’s what is fun, it is so much fun down there.
16:57
‘Cuz one time I showed up down in the kitchen, and I said, “How can I help?”
17:00
And they’re all like, “Oh no, no, we don’t need your help.” And I said,
17:02
“No, I’m here to help.” They said, “Well here’s 20 pounds of onions,
17:05
can you chop them up?” “Well, okay.
17:07
I guess I volunteered for this.
17:09
I think, have you ever heard of this thing called a food processor?
17:11
And you just put the stuff in it and it chops it up?” “Oh that’s not
17:13
traditional.” I’m thinking, “I don’t care, it’s 20 pounds of onions,
17:19
that’s a lot of onions.” So, so it’s a lot of fun because I think you get to
17:21
meet people, and talk about different things, and I think that’s real
17:24
important for me, as a faculty member.
17:26
And also, students just, sort of, hang out together and talk about stuff.
17:29
And you’re doing something that, you know, telling somebody to chop up onions.
17:33
Okay, you can’t mess it up a whole lot, so
17:40
yeah.
17:40
So, I hope that answered your question.
17:41
No, it did.
17:43
What recommendations do you have for OSU to become a more-inclusive campus?
17:48
Oh, gosh.
17:49
Hm.
17:54
For a long time, there’ve been a lot of groups who’ve suggested that we need
17:58
somebody in charge of diversity on campus.
18:03
And I’m always torn ‘cuz I think, I don’t know how that works and I haven’t
18:07
really investigated other institutions to know how it works for them.
18:10
But a lot of other places have, like, a chief diversity
18:12
officer or something like that.
18:16
And we’ve had lots of committees that have met and done research
18:20
and checked on things and they’ve suggested different things.
18:22
A lot of times, those are notorious for being all this work putting in
18:27
and then it gets put on the shelf.
18:29
So, some of it is just—there’s another group going right now that’s
18:33
got more deans and upper, sort of, big-shot, more powerful people.
18:38
I’m hoping that they get listened to, and whatever they come up with becomes
18:42
a decision that changes the university.
18:43
I think the university needs to take some sort of visible step on
18:48
supporting diversity on campus.
18:50
Right now, it’s sort of, you know, there’s a lot of really good people and a lot
18:54
of different places, and if there’s some way to pull us together a little bit
18:57
more, that would be a good thing, so.
19:01
Yeah, right now, it’s pretty, pretty spread out
19:07
all over.
19:07
Could you reflect on the season of change the university is currently in
19:11
and where you see the university heading in the future in terms of diversity?
19:16
Um, tell me more what you mean by season of change do you think?
19:20
Um, well.
19:22
[break]
19:26
What do you think our enrollment now compares to the people, students of
19:32
color video that we discussed in class?
19:35
Oh okay.
19:36
Um, students of color video that we saw was relatively recent.
19:42
So I was also thinking about when I was, when I first came.
19:45
Like I said, the numbers were pretty low.
19:51
But, more recently, the numbers have grown, especially with certain
19:56
groups—Asian-American groups, some of the Pacific Islander groups,
20:00
and Latino groups, the numbers have grown more dramatically.
20:05
I think African-American numbers have stayed pretty stagnant which
20:07
is not, I don’t think, a good thing.
20:09
I think there are more people who should be, we should be recruiting
20:13
and going after and saying, “hey come to Oregon State, it’s a good place to
20:16
be.” Back in the ‘60s, the reason that EOP was created was that there was a
20:22
walk-out of black students in 1968.
20:25
There was a disagreement between a football player and the head coach of
20:29
the football team about whether they could grow facial hair during off-season.
20:33
It sounds like a funny reason to have this huge blow-up, but, I think, it was just
20:39
the tip of the iceberg of students, black students, being on campus being followed
20:42
around by the campus police, being kicked out of fraternities and told they couldn’t
20:47
join, and being, you know, just being discriminated against a lot on campus.
20:51
And this was it, that was like, that was the final straw.
20:54
And it created this situation where, my understanding is, the vast majority
20:59
of black students on campus got together and did a walk-out of campus.
21:04
And some of them literally left campus and gave up scholarships and gave up their
21:10
college plans and never returned college.
21:13
So, this was a huge change in their lives.
21:15
I mean, that—I wouldn’t have the guts to do that kind of thing; I would be like
21:19
staying real low and trying not to make my parents mad at me for doing something
21:23
they thought was wrong or something.
21:25
So, that took a lot of guts to do something like that.
21:27
So the university responded by creating EOP as a means of providing
21:33
support for those students.
21:34
So that was at least a start on the university’s part.
21:37
I think the cultural centers were also the same sort of thing in terms of providing
21:43
some place where students felt like there were staff and faculty who understood
21:47
them, there are peers that they could get together with, and some place where they
21:52
didn’t, didn’t feel like they were sort of the focus of attention all the time.
21:56
Because when I’ve talked to students before, one of the
21:59
big things they’ve said—I had a student several years ago who was
22:02
African-American, male, chemistry major.
22:06
And he said he got to his junior-level classes and here are all these other
22:09
people he’d seen in his freshman classes, his sophomore classes, in the tutoring
22:14
rooms, in the labs, all this stuff—walked into his junior year and they said,
22:18
“Hey you must be in the wrong class.” He’s like, “You know me, you know who
22:21
I am, why would you say that?” They said, “Well, aren’t you an athlete?”
22:24
He’s like, “No, you’ve known me for two years and you know I’m not an athlete,
22:27
why would you assume I was?” They said, “Well that’s what all the black guys
22:30
on campus are, right.” So, you know, sometimes stereotypes really override our
22:34
common sense and stuff we already know.
22:36
So, there’s still a ways to go on some of those things, and I think the more
22:41
numbers that we have on campus, and the more we can mix people together at their
22:44
comfort level, the better off we all are.
22:47
Because I—it still bothers me that we send most of our students, a vast
22:52
majority of our students, graduates out into the world with never having had
22:56
an African-American faculty member in front of them in the classroom because
23:00
we don’t have very many on campus.
23:01
That’s a disservice to you as students to not have had any opportunity
23:07
to develop relationships with any faculty of color for the most part.
23:11
Because you’re probably going to go a part of the world where you’re gonna
23:16
have to know how to work with people.
23:18
And if you go out there with stereotypes in your heads, it’s going to be really
23:21
hard--and we don’t want to send you out there with a hard time, we want to
23:24
make it as easy for you as possible.
23:27
Numbers-wise, I think there’s a huge advantage, and I—also makes people feel
23:31
not as, they don’t stick out as much and so there’s more, there’s more people who
23:35
understand what they’re going through, so.
23:37
How does that influence you as being a mentor to people
23:42
of color here, or any student?
23:43
You know, yeah, yeah.
23:45
I think I’m more—I don’t like to think of myself as a mentor, sounds weird.
23:54
Somebody asked me, “Will you be my mentor?” I’m like, “I
23:56
don’t know what that means.”
23:57
That’s a good thing though.
23:58
Yeah I think so, but it feels weird to me.
24:00
Yeah I’ll hang out with you and I’ll talk with you and stuff,
24:03
just seems a funny title to me.
24:05
Yeah, it doesn’t—I have to figure out what that means in my head.
24:09
But um, I think I—if a student of color asks, certainly yeah.
24:14
Can we just talk about how you got here or what’s going to help me do you think,
24:18
and those kinds of things, certainly.
24:19
And any student, I’m open to that.
24:22
I just tend to hang out more with certain groups, so I think
24:27
they see me as more—they see me more and they recognize me.
24:29
So, I think that happens a little bit more, so.
24:32
Alright.
24:34
And what are some issues of importance with respect to people of color in the
24:38
community that the community’s facing?
24:41
Oh okay.
24:43
I can speak, maybe, more particularly about Asian-Americans, yeah.
24:49
Just there’s so, so many.
24:51
A lot of the issues that the Asian-American community faces
24:59
have to deal with timing, I think.
25:02
‘Cuz
25:05
I was talking with a student a couple years ago who said, “well, I don’t—how
25:08
will you understand” - an Asian-American student whose parents immigrated here,
25:12
they were born here right after their parents immigrated so they were born
25:15
in the United States but their parents were definitely not Americanized yet?
25:19
So, we’re trying to—we’re having this conversation about how could
25:23
I, as a third generation person, understand what their situation is.
25:26
I said, I can’t ‘cuz I’m not in that situation, but we can talk to
25:30
each other and we can try to come closer to each other to understand.
25:33
It’s just like any other culture, too—I can’t understand what it’s like to be
25:36
African-American, but that doesn’t, shouldn’t stop me from wanting to get
25:41
to know people and get to understand what their situation is like better.
25:46
And I hope I don’t come across as saying, no I understand all, what
25:50
all you all are going through.
25:51
I may understand what their children’s children may go through because it
25:55
seems like it’s a similar pattern of acculturation that happens, at least
25:58
within Asian-American communities.
26:02
I forgot what your question was.
26:03
Oh, it was issues of importance in respect to Asian-Americans,
26:10
people of color in general.
26:11
Yeah, you know.
26:12
So there’s the timing thing, the acculturation thing.
26:17
The issues that I see that may not be generally seen within Asian-American
26:22
population in any way, is how do we keep Asian-American college students
26:28
in particular – ‘cuz that’s who I work with--how do we keep them,
26:34
how do we help them become what they want to become, whatever that
26:37
is, and however Americanized that is, or however culturally, whatever
26:42
they retain, whatever that is?
26:44
But also, gain some sort of a political understanding and ways to work together
26:50
to make things better for other people.
26:52
I think that’s the tricky piece, especially if people are relatively
26:56
recent immigrants to the United States or their parents were.
26:59
I think that, a lot of times, a lot of energy’s spent on just surviving.
27:02
So how do you just survive but also do these other things that you have
27:05
to have more than just survival at?
27:08
You have to be able to have time and energy and support to go and
27:13
try to make change in these others ways to, you know, have protests
27:18
and do those kinds of things.
27:19
So, I think part of our job is to help students figure out how to
27:22
do that--how to have them so that they’re not just surviving on campus
27:26
as students but that they’re growing and learning and also feel like
27:29
they’re making this contribution back.
27:31
Because I think that’s what makes—I mean, people feel a lot
27:33
better after things like that too.
27:39
So.
27:40
Could you just talk about, a little bit about your APCC roles
27:44
and how you contributed to that?
27:45
Oh, okay, okay.
27:48
You know, years ago when we were talking—there were the cultural
27:51
centers were being developed along the way, and there was a lot of
27:54
talk amongst the Asian-American students about do we need a center?
27:59
What would—why would we need a center?
28:00
What would we do with a center?
28:01
What does that mean?
28:02
Because the thing is about Asian-Americans, and a lot of the others
28:06
groups too, is that calling somebody Asian-American is this gigantic group.
28:10
There’s like 60 or 70 different ethnicities minimum with there,
28:15
lots of different languages, lots of different backgrounds.
28:18
Until the ‘80s, late ‘70s, the main groups were Japanese-Americans,
28:24
Chinese-Americans, Korean-Americans because the way immigration went
28:27
with from Asia, in particular, into the United States.
28:32
It shut down in 1924 and opened up again in ’53 and still had
28:36
this real tight limit on it.
28:39
So if you were Chinese, we could have ten or something—I don’t know what the
28:42
numbers were, they were really small.
28:43
So the majority of the populations were people who had grown up
28:47
here, which is real different.
28:49
And during that time, also during like the late ‘50s, is when the
28:52
Japanese-American third generation started realizing what camp was because most
28:57
of our parents wouldn’t talk about it.
28:58
They’re like, “Oh camp, camp, camp.” And then they realized, “Oh wait,
29:01
no, these were prison camps, wait now we have pictures, oh.” So this
29:06
political realization plus the ‘60s were happening and all that kind of stuff.
29:10
So there’s that group of people.
29:13
There’s a group of people who are, like me, third generation, fourth
29:15
generation, fifth generation, and very acculturated--grew up in a
29:19
very white neighborhood or whatever.
29:21
And then, all of a sudden, we have people who are coming in who had--just
29:26
were--had refugee status from Southeast Asia because of the war and had been
29:30
really, pretty much, just picked up and dropped in the United States.
29:34
So we have all this--sort of, we’re all trying to figure out who’s who
29:38
and who is Asian and who gets to call themselves what and what qualifies.
29:43
And just talking with each other and realizing we don’t
29:45
know where to start talking.
29:47
So those conversations were really, really, interesting to me between the
29:51
first few Vietnamese students that we had who came because they came,
29:55
those were some of the earlier ones.
29:57
People who were like, especially air-lifted out of Vietnam just as
29:59
the war ended, had educations there but had no credentials, and so came
30:04
to school in the United States.
30:06
Already some of them were doctors already or engineers or something,
30:09
but didn’t have a license for it.
30:11
So, highly educated people in Vietnam and coming here and having to wash
30:17
dishes while they got their night school degree or something like that.
30:20
So all of this really interesting stuff going on, and how do
30:22
we come to some agreement?
30:24
And, the other piece in the mix, were the people from Hawaii.
30:28
And I remember we had an administrator from Hawaii and we sat down with him
30:32
and he said, “I don’t understand, in Hawaii we don’t talk about this
30:35
stuff.” He said, “In Hawaii you’re the majority.” You know, Japanese-Americans
30:38
were 45% of the population in Hawaii, and then you have the Chinese-Americans
30:42
and the Korean-Americans and the Filipino, so the vast majority in Hawaii
30:47
identify as what we would call Asian Pacific Islanders on the mainland.
30:50
And there, it’s like, why even say anything because we’re
30:54
everywhere in everything.
30:56
So, trying to come to some agreement between the third, fourth generation
31:01
Asian-Americans, the recent, the newer immigrants, and then the people of
31:05
Hawaii who had been here, whose families had been here for a long time but had
31:08
a real different sense of identity.
31:10
So that, to me, was a great accomplishment of the APCC is bringing
31:15
those people together and coming to some agreement about why there was a
31:18
need for a cultural center, because there was a lot of disagreement.
31:21
And finally, it came together.
31:24
We got--and we started out in a little room in Snell Hall, which was very small.
31:28
It was like 10 by 10 or something and had two chairs
31:31
and a table and it was about it.
31:33
And it was like, “Oh, oh thanks, we can fit four people in here.” And at that
31:37
time, we had, I don’t know how many, thousand Asian-Americans at least, so.
31:42
So, but we knew we were in line for getting one of the old houses they had
31:47
on campus at that point, where people would—they were rented out to people, I
31:51
think, in some sort of lease agreement where whenever they left, then the
31:56
property would revert back to university.
31:58
And they were probably gonna take down those houses and
32:00
build some other building.
32:02
So, we got in line and we got a choice between an old, green house,
32:08
I think, down where the parking structure is now and then where the
32:13
APCC is now out on 26th and Jackson.
32:16
And we went for that one, partially, because it was close to the BCC and we
32:21
wanted, we knew there was trouble--there had been trouble in the past for vandalism
32:24
at the BCC; somebody had burned a cross in their lawn, yeah some really horrid stuff.
32:29
And we knew with those two being close enough to each other, they would be able
32:33
to provide mutual support to each other.
32:35
And both of them had living facilities, so, at that time, the coordinator at
32:39
the BCC was living upstairs and the coordinator at the APCC lived upstairs.
32:43
They had full—you know there was a bathroom and full living
32:46
because it was a house before.
32:48
So that was the goal at that point with the hope that they
32:51
would work more closely together.
32:55
And now, we have the new building being built, and it’s gonna—it no
32:59
longer has the living facility in there because we don’t need that anymore,
33:04
it’s not on the fringes of campus.
33:05
So, I’m very excited about the new building.
33:07
We got to go on a tour of the inside of it the other day, and it was really, it was
33:11
very cool to see what it’s gonna become.
33:14
It’s going to be open pretty soon too, so yeah.
33:17
I’m excited for the possibilities.
33:19
Cool, looks pretty new.
33:21
I walk past it every Tuesday.
33:22
It changes every week, I swear.
33:25
Yeah.
33:25
Well, it’s supposed to be open--they’re supposed to be
33:27
moving things the end of December.
33:29
So that’s really soon, yeah.
33:30
Oh wow, that’s really soon.
33:32
In fact, we’re supposed to be teaching a U-Engage class there next term.
33:34
I don’t know about that, we’ll see.
33:37
We’ll see if there’s furniture or anything.
33:40
Inside walls would be good too.
33:41
Oh.
33:41
Yeah, insolation.
33:43
Yeah, heat, electricity, that’d be good.
33:48
And then, what about the history of EOP, the services, and roles?
33:52
Oh okay.
33:54
Like I said before, the EOP came about because of the walk-out of black students.
33:59
So we always try to remember that because we owe a lot to the courage
34:04
of those students to take a stand on something on these issues.
34:09
And so, at that point, there were very few students in the program because
34:14
there weren’t near as many—well after the walk-out—there weren’t near as many
34:17
African-American students on campus.
34:19
And, but the people who created it were pretty forward-thinking, and they
34:24
didn’t say, “Oh you have to be a student of color to be in EOP.” And basically
34:27
they said, “You know, we’re looking at groups that we know have, don’t
34:31
have the same access to, or graduation from higher education.” So the main
34:37
criteria were based on what were then TRIO, the TRIO student support services
34:41
criteria—based on that but expanded.
34:43
So, TRIO is first generation students, low income students,
34:47
and students with disabilities.
34:49
And EOP is that plus students of color, really isolated students,
34:53
veterans, older than average students, single parents, sort of that group of
34:58
students that face a few more hurdles in the way of completing college.
35:03
So, EOP, I like the basis of EOP because it’s—the idea is there’s students out
35:09
there if they’re, if they want to apply for the program--because no one’s making
35:12
them apply--if they want to apply for the program, have access to the services,
35:15
then yes, we want you to come on in.
35:17
But you’re also making a commitment because the first term students are
35:21
in the program, they have to commit to working, to meeting with an
35:24
academic counsellor every two weeks.
35:26
So that gives them that person, that sort of mentor person that has
35:30
a lot of knowledge about how the university works, and deadlines, and
35:33
classes, and all that kind of stuff.
35:34
But, more it’s somebody that they can come and say, “You know, day care
35:38
didn’t work out, I had to take my kids to class, you know, how do I, how do I
35:42
figure this stuff out?” Or even, brand new freshmen students who are like, I,
35:48
you know, “I am 415 miles away from home and this is the biggest city I’ve ever
35:52
been in, what am I supposed to do?” So I think there’s a lot of advantages.
35:56
And, you know, and all the research shows that there’s huge
36:00
advantages to people having access to that kind of person on campus.
36:05
So, I think it’s on a good basis in that way—the foundation of it is real solid.
36:14
And then, could you talk a little bit more about the TRIO
36:16
project and what exactly that is?
36:18
Oh, okay.
36:18
TRIO is a federal program through the U.S. Department of Education, and it’s
36:23
been around since the ‘60s, I think, and has a bunch of different levels.
36:28
And it’s called TRIO because it used to be three programs but now there’s
36:31
seven, but they never changed the title.
36:34
So it’s kind of hard to explain, it’s like—but the first main ones were Upward
36:39
Bound, students of Portland—Upward Bound which is for high school students
36:42
and they helped them get into college.
36:46
Educational Talent Search which is also for high school students.
36:49
And then, Student Support Services, which is for students while they’re in college.
36:52
Since then they’ve added some other ones.
36:56
The main one we’re looking to apply for next is called
36:59
the McNair Scholars Program.
37:01
And that’s a program that takes TRIO eligible students, so first
37:05
generation, lower income, students with disability, plus underrepresented
37:09
students of color, and helps prepare them for doctoral programs.
37:12
So not even just aiming at graduate school, it’s like, we’re gonna
37:15
get you into doctoral programs.
37:16
‘Cuz it’s named after Ron McNair who was an astronaut in the Challenger when it
37:20
blew up, and his family worked really hard with a lot of different federal
37:25
agencies to get funding for a program that would encourage more, especially,
37:28
you know, African-American, Latino, Native American students--especially
37:32
because they’re so underrepresented in the science field--to get into doctoral
37:36
programs and hopefully, become your teachers, and professors, and scientists,
37:42
and researchers, and stuff in the future.
37:44
Because we’re losing--we’re crazy as a nation sometimes—we’re losing
37:48
this huge pool of creative ability and intelligence and just energy
37:55
by not tapping into that group, so.
37:58
I think it’s got a huge potential, and we’d really like to get—we had it
38:01
here at one point, the McNair project, but we’d like to get it back again
38:05
‘cuz it fits Oregon State really well.
38:07
I mean we have a lot of STEM majors, we have a lot of students,
38:09
and we have a lot of undergraduate research that could participate, so.
38:16
What were some of your challenges and how did you strive to overcome them?
38:19
Oh, okay.
38:21
Challenges.
38:24
Some of the challenges were just from, you know, growing up in a small town
38:27
and trying to adjust to a bigger city.
38:30
And I don’t remember that being that hard.
38:33
Some of the challenges are—one of the challenges,
38:41
let’s see, let me pick one.
38:42
One of the challenges I think would be
38:49
being a woman of color on this campus.
38:51
And sort of, either being, having people—I would, I don’t want people to
38:55
roll their eyes when I walk in a room and go, “Oh here she comes again, and she’s
38:57
gonna talk about the same thing again.” But, I’m probably going to talk about
39:01
the same thing again [laughter] . So, it’s how do you, how do you, how do I
39:09
keep trying to move things forward without having people go, “We don’t
39:13
want to talk about this anymore?” But we haven’t made enough change.
39:16
So how do you convince people that we still haven’t made enough change,
39:19
we still need to keep working on some of these things, even though
39:21
they’re tired of hearing about it?
39:23
Because, being tired of hearing about it is a luxury.
39:25
You know, if you’re, if you have a position of privilege, you can say--if
39:32
you’re, you know, if you’re a white male and you can say, “I don’t want to hear
39:36
about women’s issues anymore, I don’t really care,” and maybe you don’t have to
39:39
hear about it anymore, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not just as relevant
39:42
or more relevant for women. So it’s how do you, how do we keep the conversation
39:47
going and keep some forward momentum so that change happens for the future?
39:54
And that’s, that’s a long haul.
39:58
And when I look back, I think okay, a lot of change has happened—we have DPD, we
40:01
have an Ethnic Studies Department, we have all the cultural centers, and the four
40:06
that are being rebuilt, and the new one.
40:08
Some changes happened.
40:10
It’s been slow and may not have been want everyone wants, and we always slip back
40:16
a little bit when the blackface happens, we’re like, wait, I thought we—I didn’t
40:21
think we’d have to deal with this anymore.
40:24
And so, how do we do, how do we keep moving forward and how do we keep
40:27
people’s energy up and still being interested in being involved with
40:31
making change happen when it feels like it’s going so slow, especially
40:34
when students cycle through real fast.
40:36
So the good thing about working at a university is that, wow, we get students
40:41
here, they’re all energized, they’re here for like 4 or 5 years, and the
40:44
bad thing is they’re here for like 4 or 5 years and then it cycles through.
40:49
And sometimes we have to back up and start again and say, okay, oh yeah, we
40:52
didn’t educate this piece very well, and so it didn’t stay present in the, sort
40:56
of in the conscience of the student body.
40:59
Yeah.
40:59
That’s awesome, yeah.
41:03
And then, what do you see as some of your greatest accomplishments?
41:06
Oh dear.
41:09
Some of my greatest accomplishments.
41:11
Some of them, I guess, would be being involved with the DPD, creation of the
41:17
DPD, and being involved with the creation of the Ethnic Studies Department,
41:23
being involved with keeping this, the College Students Services Administration
41:27
going as long as possible, being involved with the faculty of color group, just some
41:34
of those organizations and some of those changes that have occurred on campus.
41:37
I think those are pretty important.
41:39
That and those are like secondary to all the students that we have that graduated.
41:43
There’s—we get calls from alum who say, “Hey I got into grad school,”
41:46
or “Oh, did I tell you what I’m doing right now?” Or they come back
41:49
and visit and they bring their kids.
41:50
Sometimes they bring their kids and they go, “Oh, we’re travelling around
41:53
looking at colleges.” So, yeah, just seeing people being successful,
41:56
too, I think that’s pretty major.
41:59
So.
41:59
Great, and then is there anything else that we haven’t talked about that
42:02
you want to add, any other stories?
42:04
Wow.
42:05
No, I think I’m pretty good.
42:08
I got more stories, but I think I’m pretty good right now, so.
42:11
Awesome.
42:12
Thank you so much for coming.
