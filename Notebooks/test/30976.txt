00:01
My name is Natalia Fernández I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian
00:06
a staff member with OSU’s Special Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:11
Today’s date is May 28, 2014 and I am interviewing Ji-Hae Kang a staff member
00:18
of the Asian and Pacific Cultural Center at Oregon State University.
00:24
So, if you could state your name and please spell it out loud.
00:27
My name is Ji-Hae Kang J-I H-A-E last name K-A-N-G
00:35
And what is your home town or where is home for you?
00:39
I was born in South Korea but my home would be Beaverton, Oregon.
00:46
And when did you move there?
00:49
I’ve lived there for almost all my life.
00:51
I moved back and forth so the last time I moved back was since [I was]
00:55
ten years old so fifteen years.
00:59
And what is your age, year in school, and major?
01:03
I am currently 25; a senior; and I am majoring in general
01:08
science with a minor in chemistry.
01:11
And what are your self-identities in terms of race and ethnicity?
01:16
I identify myself as
01:19
an Asian American.
01:23
And in terms of your work at the APCC, what is your position, so
01:27
what do you do and how many years have you worked for the APCC?
01:32
This is my first year working here.
01:34
I am a cultural center coordinator.
01:37
We basically work with the program database where we input the events and
01:43
what we did and evaluations for them.
01:46
We also take care of the scrapbooks so we also have a little history of our center.
01:52
We also have our own events that we hold, once per term at least.
01:56
And we just, and for the most part everyone in the staff
02:02
does housework around the center – that’s about what we do.
02:06
And are there two of you, three of you?
02:09
There are four of us.
02:10
There are four of you, okay.
02:12
So how do you decide how to divide the work?
02:15
Or do you basically have specialized parts of the job that you do?
02:21
So each term our internal coordinator, she will basically kind of pick a
02:30
job for us to do for the entire term.
02:32
So the first term I was in charge of listserve
02:37
and scrapbooking, and the second term I was in charge of database,
02:42
and this term I am in charge of the libraries and scrapbooking.
02:46
It goes around, it rotates, and anything else if we just see
02:51
something that needs to be worked on in the center we’ll do that.
02:54
Or if anyone needs help in the center we just go and help them if we can.
02:59
Great, have you worked for any of the other cultural centers?
03:03
No, this is the only cultural center I’ve worked at.
03:07
So why did you decide to work at the APCC?
03:11
Well, this is the only cultural center I have really been to and
03:16
I started coming here last year.
03:20
I mean I have known about it for a while and last year was when I really started
03:23
utilizing the space and I felt really connected I guess one, because I am of
03:28
Asian ethnicity and the center promotes a lot of Asian cultures and it was
03:34
really fun to learn about the events.
03:36
Just coming here and getting to meet people and the staff and just becoming
03:39
friends with them it was just a really nice experience and I wanted to kind
03:43
of, I guess, spread that and you know, just kind of share my experiences too
03:48
and make other people feel welcome.
03:50
And I guess just continue that.
03:54
So originally did you start coming to the APCC to use their services and
03:59
resources, to attend the events, or both?
04:04
It started off with the resources honestly because, and free printing
04:10
– at the library it costs money - but eventually I started to get to know the
04:14
staff members and we became friends; it just kind of happened in a sequence.
04:21
Eventually it ended up me going to their events as well and just you
04:25
know I just got really involved with the center after a while.
04:31
And so, what were your expectations, hopes for your work, and were they
04:35
matched, surpassed, not matched?
04:40
My expectations, I guess, was to just really get to meet new people
04:46
and I guess promote the diversity of the Asian cultures, or the Asian
04:53
Pacific cultures to be more exact.
04:56
And I would say, at the very least it did match or if anything it surpassed
05:02
it, because I am really introverted so its hard for me to get to meet
05:08
new people unless I am introduced to them by friends there is just a
05:11
limit how much people you can meet.
05:14
But working here I had to put myself out there and get to meet people first and
05:19
it just, it was a lot of new experiences for me which I really appreciate because
05:24
that will help me out in the long run, you know, where I can be confident
05:28
about myself and say, “Hi my name is Ji-Hae Kang, what’s your name?” and “how
05:29
is your day going?” You know, things that are really hard for me to do.
05:34
And, just working here and trying to come up with ideas for events
05:41
and researching and all these, and researching to do a very good job
05:46
at presenting the information we learned for the event in itself.
05:51
It was a really big learning experience and I also learned a lot of about
05:57
micro-aggression, you know just those little things that I didn’t think about
06:01
before working here because racial slurs, jokes, they have been here for as long
06:06
as I have been alive and even longer and for me, like before this I actually
06:11
accepted them as they were but working here I started realizing that they are
06:17
not okay, they do affect people and once I started realizing that I started
06:23
noticing the small, you know, those little things going on all around me.
06:29
And I, it’s really up to someone, someone needs to start,
06:35
someone needs to stand up against it and fight it and so
06:41
I was really glad that the center was working towards that and I also
06:45
became more vocal about it; if someone did that I would be like, “that’s not
06:50
acceptable, that was rude and you need to apologize” you just the little things.
06:55
I feel like small acts can go bigger so definitely it’s been surpassed for
07:02
sure if anything it’s been matched.
07:05
And so can you describe the projects, events, activities during these
07:11
past few terms that were especially meaningful to you that you worked on?
07:16
Fall term, the one that stuck out to me was, what was the name of the
07:23
event?...I think it was our first dead week feast because, I mean, it wasn’t
07:30
just the cultural coordinator that put it together but it was the entire staff
07:34
that came together that put it together.
07:36
Like start from planning to executing, just everything was planned all together.
07:43
Also that was the first time we got to meet our two new coworkers because we
07:49
were missing two staff when we started the year and so the two staff came in
07:56
later in the term and that was the first time we actually had to work together.
07:59
So that was really meaningful to me in that sense and it was
08:02
our first really big, big event.
08:04
And for winter term,
08:11
I don’t really have one for winter term.
08:14
But for spring term the one that was really meaningful to me was the
08:18
migration event that the cultural center had, all four of us had together.
08:26
Because I am considered an immigrant because I was born outside of the country
08:30
and just learning the history and what happened, you know, what’s going on
08:33
right now, just those little things that came to me more personally I feel like.
08:39
And I felt like everyone should know where their origins came from and what their
08:46
ancestors or relatives had to go through for us to get this opportunity right now.
08:53
So that stuck to me and was pretty meaningful.
08:59
So what have been your challenges working at the APCC
09:03
and how have you overcome them?
09:05
This one I actually, I mentioned it earlier - I’m really introverted I have
09:13
the hardest time saying “hi” to new people and one of the biggest challenges, if
09:18
anything, was the events and having to say “hi” to people when they come into
09:22
the center and say, “hi how was your day?
09:24
Do you need any help?” Just that simple phrase was deadly to me, so I think
09:31
that was my greatest challenge and also
09:35
being very aware of all these, you know, micro-aggressions, whatever it was, just
09:43
being very aware of cultural diversity that was, it was really new to me so I
09:48
guess that was a challenge in itself.
09:53
And in terms of overcoming them was it just a matter of practice that
09:57
through your job you were able to work on the things you wanted to work on?
10:03
Yeah, I think it was more of practice at sure, I mean at first I did say “hi” but I
10:10
was just really shy; I would be like [in a low voice] “hi, how are you?” and now it’s
10:16
just [in a louder voice] “hey, welcome!” - You know it’s just, I still have room
10:21
for improvement because I still have trouble doing this outside of work but
10:26
it’s still a big improvement in itself.
10:30
And what have been your successes working at the APCC?
10:37
Being able to, I guess recognize what going on around me in terms of ethnicity
10:46
or sexual orientation just whatever it is, any sort of aggression that I kind
10:51
of used to just push aside and go, “Oh whatever, that happens all the time,
10:56
it was just a joke, they don’t mean any harm from that” but those things are
11:00
what really keeps the racism and those, you know, phobias here so that would be
11:10
my biggest success - being able to be aware of them.
11:16
And what have been your interactions with staff from the other cultural centers?
11:21
This one unfortunately is something that I didn’t get to do much of because
11:28
well one, we try to get the CCCC to
11:35
work on the immigration event with us.
11:38
We felt that it was because the Asians and Southern Americans are
11:43
the biggest immigration group so we thought it was really appreciate for
11:48
them to kind of collaborate with us.
11:50
But what we found was that it was really hard to get communication going and
11:56
responses that were quick enough to get things started so it just never really
12:01
happened .That was kind of sad because I was hoping to get to know the other
12:07
cultural centers more and work with them.
12:10
and with your specific position it’s more internal
12:14
Yeah it’s…
12:15
It’s more based on like your work duties
12:17
And just like, and I don’t know if you remember but I did say that
12:22
there is internal coordinators that gives us our jobs, I don’t know I
12:25
guess things to do for the term.
12:29
So basically we were divided into two groups, ones under the external
12:33
coordinator’s umbrella and one is under the internal the cultural center
12:38
coordinators are the only ones that are what the internal coordinator, meaning
12:42
we are more of the internal, we work with the office for the center specifically and
12:47
the other ones are more outreach based.
12:49
So that’s another reason why I think we haven’t been able to
12:54
work with other centers as much.
12:58
So let’s talk about the new center.
13:01
Were you apart of the process for that, for the creation of the new center?
13:05
Did you take part of the ground breaking ceremony that occurred earlier this term?
13:11
I wasn’t part of the design process because when I found out about it,
13:15
it was after the layouts came out and it was all online and I heard it from
13:21
Aunty Sandy that it was done and what happened behind the scenes basically.
13:27
I was a part of the ground breaking event so I was there supporting our
13:31
staff members and helping plan what should be the little performances
13:36
I guess for the ground breaking.
13:40
That was pretty fun.
13:42
What does the new center mean to you?
13:45
To me it feels like it’s a new start; it’s like a kick off point for the APCC because
13:54
right now we’re on the outskirts of campus where almost nobody knows about it.
13:59
The fact that we are moving to the heart of campus next to the
14:02
MU and Weatherford the two most well know buildings on campus.
14:07
I think, I’m hoping this will be an opportunity to educate more people
14:14
in our community about the diversity of Asian culture and not just, and
14:18
we’re not all Chinese, we’re not all Japanese, we’re not all in the same
14:23
group; each of us is so diverse and we want to be able to emphasize that.
14:29
So I am really excited for the new center.
14:32
It’s a new start for us for sure.
14:36
I assume you plan to graduate this year, will you plan to
14:40
return to see the new center?
14:42
I have been telling the staff members that I will be back, they
14:46
can’t get rid of me quite yet [laughs] I will be visiting often.
14:49
And I am trying to come back for grad school or post doc so hopefully I will be
14:54
back here enough to visit them and if I do come back as a student I will reapply.
15:00
I want to be able to work at the APCC again for sure.
15:05
So in terms of the ideas for the future and the bigger picture, what
15:10
projects, events, or activities would you have liked to have seen or
15:15
would you recommend in the future?
15:19
I don’t know about anything I would have liked to see because we have a
15:23
big diverse, we had a wide range of events that was just social to really
15:31
educational and social justice based.
15:34
What I do recommend is
15:38
trying to, I mean we have a lot of events that talk about polices and just
15:45
histories but I haven’t really seen any events that really talked about
15:50
the diversity of our cultures as much.
15:52
I mean, I know it’s hard there are twenty plus Asian countries, so its hard to
15:57
talk about the diversity of each one, but if there was a way to kind of like
16:02
make that a termly thing where the first term kind of looks at these few groups.
16:09
Just so people can see that were actually not all the same, you know how they say,
16:15
“all Asians look the same” or they call the lunar new year the Chinese new year
16:19
because it’s well-known to the Chinese people but several different countries
16:24
celebrate on the same day; they all have different names for it. It’s just little
16:28
things that we can educate people on.
16:30
We did have a Lunar New Year event this year that, where we tried to bring that
16:36
up but it was kind of hard to do that.
16:39
We just have really short PowerPoint slides with different points but if there
16:42
was a way to make them more interactive and fun I feel like if we really could
16:47
introduce so that you know, every, or at least more people know about the diversity
16:54
that exists in the eastern continent.
17:01
So what advice would you give future APCC staff or OSU
17:06
cultural center staff in general?
17:08
And this could be for your position specifically or
17:11
for anyone who comes to work
17:16
for the CRCs.
17:17
For everyone in general I do want to say that you know, be
17:21
aware of your surroundings, be aware of what people are saying.
17:25
And even if it may look like it’s a really small minor thing like
17:28
the “Indians are better off dead” graffiti we had not that long ago.
17:34
Other people are saying that “it’s a joke, why are you being so serious or
17:37
taking it so far?” At the same time, even it’s a joke it’s there is always
17:42
a line, someone always gets hurt from it no matter how light it may be. So
17:48
really be aware and be ready to kind of,
17:53
I don’t know, talk about it I guess like be able to respond to it appropriately.
17:59
But
18:01
the advice I want to give to APCC staff and everyone else I guess is: if you
18:07
are working for the centers, you are the face of the center for the entire year.
18:13
I mean, yes, your personal life is your personal life, but your still,
18:18
your representing your center so if you’re at the parties please act
18:22
appropriately, don’t do anything that might kind of be like, “Oh, are
18:26
other people at the center like that?
18:27
Is that the type of people they are?”
18:31
You know just, be very mindful of what you say or how you act, how you present
18:36
yourself, and really just like, just because your clocked out doesn’t mean
18:40
you can say the n-word or joke around about being homophobic you know just
18:47
those things because it’s a given you should be aware of those even when
18:54
you’re not working at the center, but if you are really working there
18:56
you really need to act appropriately.
18:59
I think this year the staff has been really good with that.
19:02
But I don’t know who the next year staff is going to be so I just want to make
19:06
sure that they be very mindful of how they act and how they present themselves
19:13
outside of the center because who you are is what people will see the center as.
19:19
That’s my advice I guess.
19:22
And based on working at the APCC, what is the takeaway if you could say
19:28
just one that you have gained that you would like to share with others?
19:35
I would say definitely communication skills, teamwork.
19:42
I guess this is really specific for my position too, we have to do an event
19:48
with all four of us, if we were to do an event, we could do our individual ones
19:52
but we are required to do one as a group.
19:55
And that really taught me a lot because it was first someone needs
20:00
to take initiative to get the group together and set a date and then set
20:06
a meeting times we can all talk about.
20:08
Just, and that all requires communication and during staff meetings we all need
20:13
to voice our opinions and interact with other staff members, and when we are
20:18
working with other people during our shift we have to be able to communicate
20:21
with them to see what’s going on what needs to be done, what has to be done.
20:26
And when people come in we need to communicate with them to see what they
20:30
need if they want to just hang out.
20:32
I think communication is the biggest thing I learned as a takeaway I have gained.
20:40
And in terms of communication, this is a little bit of the tangent,
20:44
I am curious about your work with the scrapbook specifically.
20:50
When you are in charge of the scrapbook do you have others who are at the events
20:56
give you the content or is it your job to go to the events, take photos
21:01
and then put it together, can you talk a little bit about how that works?
21:05
So that one we tried for each of us, it hard for us to go to every event so
21:10
what we tried to do is if someone has an event at the staff meeting we will
21:14
ask if anyone has time available to go and help out and try to see if anyone
21:18
can take pictures during that time.
21:21
And what we tried to do is have them send the photos to whoever is
21:26
in charge of scrapbooking so we can look through the photos, print a
21:29
few out, and make a page out of it.
21:31
And this one also kind ties back to communication because it’s really hard
21:36
to get people to send their photos in because they forget that they have
21:40
the photos or they have the photos and they just don’t send it over.
21:43
So I am constantly nagging people basically to get their photos, and you
21:48
know, to do this I have tried making a table of things like a checklist
21:52
for each event that has been done and as I check it off its been done.
21:56
It reminds them “Oh, I still have to send photos in I should do that” and
22:00
then I have also made Google documents with folders so people can access to
22:05
put the photos in themselves that they want to put in if it’s too hard to
22:07
send it to me each time they can just put it in there and I can look at it
22:11
and print it off myself. But yeah, that’s how we do scrapbooking here.
22:18
So far I have had a few people send in photos so I can get started
22:22
with the pages, have fun with it.
22:26
So what is the biggest issue for you in terms of the purpose of the
22:33
APCC and why is it so important?
22:38
Purpose of the APCC…I think for now, the biggest issue would
22:45
have, is the placement on campus.
22:50
Because we have so much that we can give that, we have so much resources
22:56
that is not being utilized because of lack of, people just don’t know
23:03
about the center, I mean people know about the CCCC and especially the
23:07
Longhouse which is right there everyone knows about the Longhouse and we say,
23:11
“Do you know the APCC?” And they go, “Oh, is that a club?” and we say “Oh,
23:15
we are a resource center too” so I guess that’s my biggest tissue but it’s
23:20
going to be fixed next year so, yay!
23:22
And I feel it is important because the school kind of analyzes each year
23:30
you know the usage of the center and why it needs to be here and how the
23:36
budget should be allocated to us.
23:39
And if we don’t have that many students knowing about it or realizing us then
23:44
the school is going to see us as being useless and you know, and I feel like
23:49
we really need to be around to be able to educate people and provide
23:54
resources and be a place where they can feel at home and just secure and safe.
24:01
So I think that s the biggest issue for the purpose of the APCC; it’s a
24:08
resource center for students that’s not being utilized as a resource.
24:13
So how would you describe the impact of the APCC on Asian Pacific Island students?
24:22
I can’t speak for everyone, but for the students who do come here
24:26
even if its not regularly they know it’s a safe place where they can
24:30
come, they are feeling included.
24:32
Nobody goes, “why are you here?” Nobody
24:38
is judgmental here so I feel like its little home away from home, for me for
24:44
sure it is. I know some people who come here, they are not staff but we see them
24:49
here every single day. It’s where they can feel included where they feel like
24:56
they get the attention when they need one.
24:59
So I feel because a lot I mean there are some students who come from a white
25:05
dominant areas or, because you know there is a very, very, very low like
25:12
percentage of Asians where they come from.
25:15
And when they come here they may feel out of place but we provide a space for
25:20
them where they feel at home and they have friends that’s just like them that
25:25
went through similar problems you know, I feel like that’s what we are able
25:31
to do for the students here that are of Asian and Pacific Islander decent.
25:37
And how would you describe the impact of the APCC on the OSU and local communities?
25:43
For the OSU and the local community
25:52
we collaborate a lot with the API Student Council which is comprised of several
25:58
or multiple Asian and Pacific Islander student leaders from their organizations.
26:04
We put on events where it’s fun and social while know you they get free
26:11
food, but it’s also a chance for people to learn about different cultures
26:16
in Asia and the Pacific Islands.
26:19
And that’s when the OSU and the community around us really get to know about us
26:26
more than us having our own little events because it’s a collaboration of twenty
26:31
some different groups for that one event.
26:34
And so word gets out more we get much more people coming several hundred people
26:39
at a time you know, I feel like by doing that OSU and the local community is able
26:47
to learn more about our cultures but also you know what we like or just what food we
26:54
eat in the most simple scale because its, because there is a stereotype where Asian
27:02
food equals noodles and rice, you know?
27:05
And then with these food events for example we are able to showcase different
27:11
types of food we have it’s not all fried rice it’s not all just chow mein even
27:16
if its noodles we can do this with it or that with that or we have this that comes
27:21
from what we have never even seen before.
27:23
So I feel like the APCC has a really big impact in the sense that we are able to
27:33
I guess the best word of choice would be educate the community
27:37
even if it’s a little bit at a time, it’s still something.
27:41
And I feel that’s what’s important, doesn’t matter if it’s a big impact or a
27:45
small impact, just the fact that someone is taking a message out of it is the
27:50
impact that I like that the APCC has.
27:54
And what suggestions or ideas do you have for continued or future collaboration
28:01
with the OSU and local community?
28:05
I would say take advantage of all the resources you can get.
28:10
Because
28:12
I think this is one of the few times we actually collaborated
28:16
with the MUPC, for mom’s weekend, I mean I think it’s an annual thing
28:22
but it’s the only time we do it.
28:24
But we really noticed the immense amount of help we can get from them.
28:29
And, what ‘s that word?
28:32
publicity I guess, it’s just the MUPC is such a big group on its own and there is
28:38
such a public place that if we’re able to work with them for example we can
28:43
get publicize we have a lot of people
28:45
that didn’t know about the APCC come to our event and get to know what we
28:49
were all about and join the event.
28:52
And I feel like this year we tried to work with a lot of the other cultural
28:59
centers if we were collaborating, I think they should really try and expand that
29:04
and just try to get anybody from around the community to collaborate with us.
29:08
Because that’s going to get exposure on so many different levels than
29:12
what we have so far and it’s going to be a learning experience for both
29:16
parties if we do that; we learn more about school policies and they learn
29:19
something about us and then the public gets to learn about both of us, right?
29:25
So I feel like I would really say
29:30
if there is any chance, just take it, don’t even hesitate, just go for it
29:34
and most likely you’re going to get them to collaborate with you and it’s
29:39
probably going to end up pretty well.
29:44
Can you describe your thoughts on why sharing your stories is
29:48
important to your identity if it is?
29:52
I think that for me it’s more
29:59
of, our voices don’t get heard as much because if we I mean growing up as a
30:06
minority and when people say things, I mean they don’t, it’s just a joke and
30:15
if we react kind of negatively at it then people will go, “why are you being
30:20
so serious?” So I was at least told to keep my mouth shut when it happened
30:26
to just keep quiet and let it go.
30:29
But I feel like it’s really important for people to know the history
30:34
and what’s going on – that this is reality and just to experience you
30:39
know, if you hear it, it might have something , it might spark an idea in
30:43
someone that they didn’t hear before.
30:45
So I feel
30:48
like expressing anything any experience that I have, any thoughts that I have,
30:54
and having a record of it is a really good idea for people to go back and go,
30:58
“Oh, so this happened this time” or “Hey, that was just last year and it’s still
31:03
going on?” or “Hey, that something I never thought of; I can try that.” And
31:08
that’s why I think it’s kind of important.
31:15
So can you talk a little bit about your experiences at OSU pertaining
31:20
to your racial or ethnic identities?
31:23
You mentioned this already a little bit regarding the micro-aggressions
31:27
that you have experienced so can you expand a little bit on that in terms
31:32
of your own personal experiences or the general OSU experiences?
31:38
So I mean I guess I can’t speak for everyone and I don’t know, I
31:43
haven’t seen too many aggression towards others, so I can’t say, and
31:48
for the most part you know it’s been a really positive experience here.
31:53
It’s really diverse and most people are very accepting of diversity so
31:57
I am really happy for that, it’s just that I have noticed that people
32:04
say things without harm that can be harmful to the person that’s taking it.
32:12
I mean I would be walking down the street people say “Oh hey, Ni Hao” and
32:17
I’m just “I’m Korean” and some others “Konichiwa” “I ‘m Korean” – you know,
32:25
they are trying to be really inclusive by saying those things to me but they
32:31
don’t realize that they are categorizing us thinking we all fit into that
32:35
one group if you look a certain way.
32:38
It’s just like how I can look at a Caucasian person and go, “Hey, are you
32:41
British?” but they may be Irish, or you know, from somewhere completely
32:47
different and so luckily that hasn’t happened too much, maybe within my
32:54
ten fingers, less than ten times, but
33:00
for the most part it was really positive but I do think there is room for
33:04
improvement and people need to learn that those things can be offensive because the
33:10
first few times, “Oh, you’re cute” but after a while it just kind of makes you
33:15
think about it, you know, it’s “What am I?
33:18
Am I just any other Asian to these people?
33:21
Because I have my identity and I’m proud of my culture.” But they don’t
33:25
recognize that and they think all of us are Japanese, all of us are
33:29
Chinese, all of us are Vietnamese.
33:31
And then another experience I’ve had was, I
33:36
don’t know if this happens a lot but you know like, I would have guys just driving
33:40
by and they would kind of make noises, so I wasn’t sure if that was supposed
33:47
to be a very good thing or a very bad thing because is it, “Dang, you’re hot?”
33:52
or is it “Oh, yellow monkeys,, go away”?
33:56
I just don’t know which one it is, like are they trying to be
33:59
funny and witty or are they just being really aggressive toward me?
34:03
I really can’t tell.
34:05
So I guess those are my experiences for my ethnic identity.
34:11
And when you, if you did, if you confronted people and tried to educate
34:17
them, did you, do you find that people are responsive and they are positive,
34:23
and they say, “Oh, I’m sorry” or do you find that for the most part they
34:26
don’t do that? What’s the response like?
34:28
For me, at least for me, they’re, they apologize, they don’t realize
34:35
that what they did was really offensive, they were just trying to
34:37
be very inclusive, just done in a very unfortunate, slightly different
34:42
direction than it should have been.
34:44
I don’t even want to say “wrong” because it’s not really “wrong” – they didn’t
34:48
know, you know, so that’s why I feel it’s really important that the APCC
34:52
and we have events where we can educate people so that these things don’t happen
34:56
anymore, where people are educated enough to know that, “Oh, she may look
35:01
this way but that doesn’t mean she is, and I should be more careful” or you
35:05
know, when they ask questions like, “Where are you from?” you know, if you
35:08
are an Asian American who’s grown up here, you’re going to say, “I’m from
35:11
Beaverton” but they go, “No, where are you from?”– “Oh, you mean am I from Korea?
35:18
Yeah, I’m from there.”So it’s just more on the education, it’s just more
35:22
than people trying to be aggressive or being, not aggressive, what’s the word?
35:30
I forgot my word now; it’s offensive, offensive.
35:34
It’s not that they’re trying to be offensive, they’re
35:36
trying to be really friendly.
35:37
That’s why I feel bad even saying anything about it a lot of times but I try to say,
35:42
“Oh, you know” so when they ask, even though I know they’re probably asking
35:45
the other one, I say, “Oh, I’m from Beaverton, but I was born in Korea” or
35:50
“my family’s from Korea” And I kind of try to let people know that, not in a very
35:57
harsh tone, that, “Hey, you know, by the way, that this can cause that?” So it’s
36:03
been a pretty positive response for sure.
36:07
Great, so before we close, is there anything that we have not discussed
36:12
that you would like to talk about or anything that we have discussed
36:15
that you would like to add to?
36:21
I don’t think I have too much.
36:24
I guess I’m just hoping for the new center because next year is the first time we
36:29
are opening up in the center of campus, it’s especially important for the new
36:35
staff members next year to really be mindful of how they present themselves.
36:39
I said this before but I’m really emphasizing it because this is the first
36:44
time we’re getting major exposure to the community and if we don’t present
36:50
ourselves right the first time it will stick around for a while and one mistake
36:57
can lead to detrimental, I don’t know, I don’t want to imagine what’s going
37:03
to happen if we were to do that, so really I just really want to emphasize
37:08
that people need to be very mindful of who they are and what they represent.
37:18
That’s great.
37:18
Okay, well, thank you so much.
37:20
Thank you.
