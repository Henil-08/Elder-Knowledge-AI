00:00
This seat’s really comfortable.
00:04
Okay, um, so I guess I’ll just do one question at a time.
00:10
What is your name, and please spell it out loud?
00:15
We’re going this way.
00:15
Okay, I’ll start.
00:18
My name is Amelia Allee.
00:20
A-M-E-L-I-A, A-L-L-E-E.
00:23
And my name is Shelby Baisden.
00:26
S-H-E-L-B-Y, B-A-I-S-D-E-N
00:31
My name is Soreth Dahri.
00:33
S-O-R-E-T-H, D-A-H-R-I.
00:38
And I am Nicthé Verdugo.
00:39
It’s N-I-C-T-H-E.
00:41
And my last name is V as in Victor, E-R-D-U-G-O.
00:45
Thank you.
00:47
What is your hometown or where is home to you?
00:50
Um, my hometown is Denver, but my home officially is Portland, Oregon.
00:56
My hometown is Gresham, but I will call home Portland and/or Corvallis.
01:02
My hometown is Karachi, Pakistan.
01:08
That’s my home.
01:11
My hometown would be Chandler, Arizona, and I would probably
01:16
call my home Corvallis.
01:20
Nice.
01:20
It’s nice to see so many people are home.
01:22
What is your age, year in school, and major?
01:24
Uh, I’m 20 years old, this is my third year at school, and I’m a
01:28
public health major with a focus in health management and policy, and I’m
01:31
also working on the certificate of food and culture and social justice.
01:36
Age, year, school, and major, yeah?
01:38
Yeah.
01:39
Sorry, I got lost in all that.
01:42
I am, I’m 22.
01:45
I’m a senior this year.
01:49
My school is public health and human sciences, I’m studying human
01:52
development and family sciences.
01:54
Yeah.
01:55
Um, I’m 21, and this my second year, and I’m studying finance
02:01
in the college of business.
02:03
And I’m 22, I’m also a senior, college of liberal arts studying ethnic studies and
02:12
a minor in women, gender, and sexuality studies.
02:15
With which ethnicities and/or races do you identify?
02:22
French, English, and Huron.
02:26
Um.
02:28
I’m not really connected to my ethnic groups quite honestly.
02:31
I most just identify as white, but I do have a lot of German and Dutch in me.
02:36
I identify mostly as Muslim, Pakistani.
02:39
I identify myself as Chicana.
02:44
Um, what is your position at the women’s center, what do you do, and how many years
02:49
have you worked for the women’s center?
02:50
I guess this isn’t really like a dialogue piece.
02:53
But, I’m currently peer facilitator and next year I’ll be a leadership liaison.
02:58
And this is my first year in Corvallis and at OSU and at the women’s center.
03:04
Um, so I’m a communications rep. This is my first year working for the center.
03:10
I worked with the center last year as a part of my other position, and that’s
03:13
how I got connected to the center.
03:20
This is my first year
03:24
work—this is my first year work—sorry--working as a peer
03:25
facilitator at the women’s center.
03:27
And before that, I used to attend the events, but I was not really working,
03:33
so I was connected last year too.
03:37
This is actually my second year working at the women’s center.
03:39
My first year was program coordinator, so creating the events.
03:44
Um, and then this year I am the leadership liaison, so one of the
03:47
mentors, one of the many mentors for the current staff at the women’s center.
03:54
Have you worked for any other cultural resource centers—when and what positions?
03:58
Not on this campus.
04:01
Worked for the women’s resource center at Portland Community College at the
04:03
Sylvania campus as a student advocate.
04:06
I haven’t worked for any other cultural resource centers other
04:10
than just collaborating with them.
04:12
Yeah, same here.
04:13
I haven’t worked with any other cultural resource center.
04:17
Me neither, nope.
04:18
I don’t know what’s going on outside, it’s really starting to irritate me.
04:23
Why did you decide to work at the women’s center?
04:29
Um, I decided to work at the women’s center because I felt
04:33
like it was a safe space where I could really, just, feel myself.
04:39
I hadn’t really felt that many other places on campus, and I felt like it
04:43
was an inclusive space where anyone who walked in could feel comfortable.
04:48
And, I agreed with their mission and I loved, um, their outlook on
04:54
feminism and how important that was.
04:56
And, like, social justice theory that we apply to our work.
05:01
And, that was just really appealing to me.
05:07
Yeah I agree with that.
05:08
My major reason why I started working here or I applied to the women’s
05:13
center was also that when I came here, I felt really comfortable.
05:16
I felt that it was a very safe space for, especially, women,
05:20
although its gender inclusive.
05:23
I felt comfortable sitting here and spending time here.
05:26
Um, and I really liked the environment and the purpose
05:30
and the mission as Shelby said.
05:32
Um, yeah.
05:36
I guess I’ll go.
05:37
I guess for me, I was doing a lot of activist working surrounding,
05:40
like my ethnic background and not really, necessarily,
05:43
recognizing my gender identity.
05:46
And so, I wanted to, like, really push myself to really learn more
05:50
about what feminism meant to me.
05:53
And so, after I got involved, I think that was where I kind of changed my
05:57
perspective about how I identify myself.
06:01
So.
06:01
Um, last year when I worked at the women’s resource center at
06:04
Portland Community College, I grew so much as an adult and as a person.
06:10
And when I was moving on to a four year school, I just
06:13
wasn’t ready to give that up.
06:15
And, honestly, the first day I was on campus, I found the women’s
06:18
center and it was, like, the second to last day to apply for this job.
06:21
And I just thought that, um,
06:27
I could really learn a lot from working here and continuing that legacy.
06:30
Um,
06:34
guess that kind of goes into the next question.
06:40
What have been your challenges working at the women’s center
06:43
and how have you overcome them?
06:48
That’s a hard question.
06:48
Yeah.
06:48
Yeah.
06:49
The challenges?
06:50
Yeah.
06:50
I’ve enjoyed it so much.
06:52
I’m kind of baffled by that question.
06:54
I mean, I think any time you’re a student leader, balance is always an issue.
07:00
I am so dedicated to the work I do here that—and my position is different than the
07:05
peer facilitator’s—but, I’m so dedicated to my job here that I find myself, like,
07:11
I don’t want to do homework I want to do work for the women’s center, you know.
07:15
And, I mean, you have to find, you have to always find that
07:18
balance as a student leader.
07:20
Um, as far as a challenge from working here, I think I, I invite people here
07:25
a lot, and then as soon as they hear the name “women’s center,” immediately
07:30
a label is put on our space. And, depending who I’m talking to, that
07:34
can be positive and/or negative.
07:36
And a lot of times it is negative.
07:37
And, um, I think it’s just something we have to try to overcome, is really
07:42
teaching people what we’re about, our purpose, being like, no, this is
07:45
a safe space where you are welcome.
07:47
Um, I think that’s a challenge, just trying to get people in here.
07:53
I agree.
07:55
Me too.
07:57
Yeah, and like, people are not really sure about our purpose.
08:00
So,
08:03
they perceive feminism as something not positive, and that is not true
08:09
because they’re not really aware of what actually we’re working towards.
08:12
We’re working towards equality and not dominating them, or dominating
08:17
men, or making them feel inferior.
08:21
But, basically, feminism does not mean what they are thinking.
08:25
So, just the lack of knowledge also is a challenge because people do
08:30
not perceive you as a person of, you know, working towards equality,
08:33
rather a person who is trying to get dominated over other populations.
08:38
So, that’s kind of a challenge too, just spreading awareness or keep
08:42
making people realize the truth.
08:45
Um.
08:45
Well
08:52
I think that even though the women’s center’s specifically a female
08:55
focused space, this year I’ve had to challenge my, my white identify and the
09:02
privilege that comes along with that.
09:04
At my last job, I didn’t feel like I had to do that so much, but this
09:10
year I’ve struggled with that.
09:11
But I think that I’ve finally, actually within the last couple weeks, started to
09:14
get over my white guilt, and I’m starting to move into doing something about it.
09:21
And that’s been really powerful for me.
09:23
That’s awesome.
09:24
That’s great.
09:33
Um, what projects, events, activities, etc. would you like to have seen and/or
09:38
would you recommend for the future?
09:41
More about sexual assault awareness.
09:43
Absolutely.
09:44
Not just the month.
09:45
Not just—exactly.
09:46
That’s what I was just going to say, not just a month because it
09:48
doesn’t just happen one month a year.
09:50
I was really kind of astonished when I moved here how little is done about that.
09:56
And that falls on me too because I have the option to do those events.
09:59
But I’d like to see more in the future.
10:01
Definitely,
10:04
yeah.
10:05
Maybe also different perspectives about what feminism means to different
10:08
communities just because we are so used to knowing more about the feminists that
10:14
were upper, you know, white communities.
10:19
And so now, what does it mean to be a person of color within the
10:23
feminist movement, and is the feminist movement still this western ideology
10:30
where we’re trying to fit into?
10:32
And so, it’s kind of just like having that discussion of what it
10:35
looks like to different communities.
10:36
So.
10:38
I think, along with what you just said, like, more events on
10:43
the historical context of it.
10:46
I can’t say it better than the way you said it.
10:48
Like, I think the misconceptions about feminism come from not understanding it.
10:53
And so, we need to not only give the historical reference, but
10:56
analyze it at the same time.
10:58
And events certainly that I think would help, um, and trying to bring people
11:01
in and being like, no, here, listen to us this is really what it’s about.
11:05
And there’s different waves of feminism.
11:07
There’s just so much of it that you just need to break it all
11:10
down so people understand why we stand for what we stand for.
11:14
So many layers.
11:17
Yeah, I think these are two big areas where we really need to focus.
11:21
Like, clarifying the definitions of the terms that we are using as well
11:25
as focusing more on issues like sexual assault, and what’s happening, and what
11:32
we can do about it, and just spreading awareness about it in the community, and
11:36
how they can keep themselves protected.
11:39
Not only women, but also men because the ratio is almost the
11:43
same, it’s actually increasing.
11:45
So it’s really sad to know.
11:50
And, what advance would you give future women’s center staff and/or
11:54
OSU cultural resource center staff?
11:57
Come in with an open mind.
12:00
I agree.
12:00
Absolutely.
12:00
I think—and that’s way easier said than done, but I think that if you work
12:04
in a CRC or you work in the women’s center, hopefully you’re learning.
12:10
And, if you’re not learning, it’s probably because of not being
12:14
open to new experiences you’re being exposed to because there’s
12:17
so much to take in in this work.
12:19
And, so coming in with an open mind and knowing that it’s a
12:23
safe space and that people intend to do well, to do good by you.
12:27
So just…
12:30
I think along with what you said, like, being prepared
12:34
that you will be challenged.
12:36
Like, your, your ways of thinking, your ideas, your—things will be challenged,
12:42
and it’s not in a negative way either.
12:44
It’s meant to make you grow.
12:46
And, um, just being prepared for that because I’ve changed a lot since I’ve
12:51
started here, and I think for the better.
12:55
Um, but it, I mean, you definitely have growing pains, but it’s
12:59
good in the end, at least to me.
13:01
I have a lot more to do.
13:03
I have a lot more to grow in, but
13:10
yeah.
13:11
Oh, okay.
13:11
So I guess for me, it’s like, doing everything with good intentions.
13:15
Being, along with being, you know, open minded and being able to challenge
13:20
yourself and being ready to be challenged, it’s also, it’s work that
13:26
you’re contributing to the community, so do it with good intentions.
13:29
Do it with a purpose.
13:31
And so, I think that will make a bigger impact than just having
13:34
to just throw out events without that, that purpose behind it.
13:37
So.
13:38
Yeah.
13:47
I think that, like, everything is always said.
13:49
I agree with all that she was saying because the work here is not, actually
13:55
I don’t feel like this is work.
13:56
I enjoy doing it, it’s part of real life.
13:59
So, just embracing all that’s happening around.
14:01
And um, yeah.
14:02
Like you said, coming with an open mind and just keeping a positive
14:07
attitude is what is required.
14:09
I think that’s all that is required because if you’re
14:11
here, you’re still learning.
14:13
We are not experts or something, but we’re students and we’re the progress system.
14:19
So, just coming with the mindset of that.
14:27
Um.
14:27
Absolutely.
14:27
Based on working at the women’s center, what is the take away that you gained
14:31
that you would like to share with others?
14:34
Where do we begin?
14:36
I
14:42
guess not being afraid to challenge certain systems that are already set
14:46
in place just because I’ve grown more as an activist in that form in terms
14:50
of what I’ve gained through the center.
14:53
So really, not being afraid of speaking up when need, when it needs to be, to happen.
14:58
And to, even if you are part of the, you know, the workforce, I guess, of
15:03
the university, you still have that voice and to use while you can at
15:10
the university, you can make a change.
15:11
I would say that would be it.
15:12
I think also to not be so afraid to break down barriers in your
15:16
own mind, in your own life.
15:17
To challenge these ideas that we have set in place before we even came to Corvallis.
15:23
Um, I think that’s been a struggle for me, but I think it gets easier the more
15:29
barriers you break down, the easier.
15:30
You’ve got momentum going and you can just keep going and grow.
15:35
Can you read the question one more time?
15:36
Yeah.
15:36
Um, based on working at the women’s center, what is the take
15:39
away that you gained that you would like to share with others?
15:44
I mean, I think it’s just changed my life across all levels, you know.
15:48
A lot of the reasons because of what you two said, like being
15:51
not afraid to challenge something and also challenging yourself.
15:54
But, I think it’s made my relationships a lot better.
15:57
It’s given me a clearer sense of who I am and what I stand for, um, which I, I was
16:04
more lost, I think, before I found that.
16:06
Like, I think I was searching for, kind of, this social justice mentality before
16:10
I came here, I just couldn’t find it.
16:11
I didn’t have those resources.
16:13
And this was my resource.
16:14
And so, I think just like, I don’t know, it’s just changed me overall.
16:20
What I, like, gained from working here was that nobody should ever generalize
16:26
or stereotype because I have faced a lot of difficulties with being in
16:31
the country so far away from home.
16:34
But, I’ve realized that not everyone is the same.
16:38
And, I want people to know that as well.
16:41
That generalizing is the worst thing that a person can do.
16:44
Um, so just be proud of yourself or your identity, and, just, think and
16:49
know that there are people who will support you and who are with you.
16:54
So, just do not think that everyone in any race is the same because there are
17:00
good people and bad people everywhere.
17:02
Um, so that’s something that I realized.
17:05
And I try to tell people that no, not white people, all white people are not
17:10
the same, all black people are not the same, all Muslims are not the same.
17:14
So, just do not generalize.
17:19
Can you describe your thoughts on why sharing your stories
17:21
is important to your identity?
17:25
I don’t want to speak for anybody else, but, um,
17:30
uh, women’s stories aren’t often told.
17:34
And, I think that the people in this room represent different
17:37
identities that aren’t heard from and frequently are omitted from the story.
17:43
So, I think that we need to actively go out there and say we exist, we have a
17:48
voice, it matters, and if you’re willing to listen, we’re willing to teach you.
17:53
Yeah.
18:00
Exactly.
18:00
That’s perfect.
18:04
Is there anything else to say?
18:04
You tell ‘em, honey.
18:13
Alright.
18:14
Next question.
18:17
Ah, I love to laugh.
18:18
Can you—can you describe your experiences at OSU pertaining to
18:23
your identities that have been particularly impactful and/or negative?
18:28
Or both?
18:31
Is impactful positive in this?
18:32
I guess, positive, negative, or impactful.
18:36
Okay.
18:38
I think an identity that I’ve become more aware of, which you talked
18:44
about earlier, is just my white identity and being in a white space
18:48
as a predominantly white university.
18:51
And, I never had to question that before I came here.
18:55
And I wouldn’t have questioned it unless I would’ve gotten involved with the work
18:59
here and the work I’ve done previously.
19:01
Um, and I’m constantly thinking about my interactions with people, and
19:05
the things I’ve internalized and how I impact individuals I work with.
19:10
I think my identity as a woman as well is also very salient to
19:15
me because I feel like I have privilege in my racial identity but
19:21
not so much in my gender identity.
19:23
And I think I relatively feel safe here, but there have been many times
19:29
where it’s apparent that, “okay this is happening because of my gender.”
19:35
Including in classes not being taken seriously by my male classmates, like
19:40
I’m playing a joke on them or something.
19:43
It’s like, well no, I’m trying to do work here.
19:45
Um, or just different things like that.
19:48
I think those are two identities that are really
19:55
salient to me.
19:55
That I think that or my identity I would say—the people that impacted me here
20:00
in the United States were mostly the domestic residents of Corvallis because
20:06
I had come with the mindset that--you know how the media shows, like, people
20:12
are, they don’t like you, they hate Muslims, or they will not respect you.
20:18
So I was, my family, they were concerned about my safety and protection.
20:22
But when I came here, I came across so many nice people.
20:27
They were so welcoming, they were so accepting, that I was like, I told
20:31
my parents that this is not the same.
20:34
And, it totally changed my mindset and the way I thought about U.S.
20:40
Although it is happening in many other places, it still exists here, but
20:44
the good thing is that it’s not on the larger scale as I was thinking.
20:48
So these people really impacted me and it, they changed the way of, the way I
20:52
thought about people in the United States.
20:56
And I’m, like, really positive impacted by them and their ways of
21:00
life, and their attitudes toward other cultures and diverse group
21:03
of peoples, especially students.
21:03
So, yeah.
21:03
Um,
21:19
it’s kind of hard for me to speak to this question because, like I said earlier,
21:22
this is my first year at OSU, and I’ve always worked in the women’s center.
21:27
And I don’t go outside of the women’s center to associate with people a lot.
21:31
I’m kind of a homebody.
21:33
So, my experiences are limited to my interactions with people within
21:38
the CRCs, which I imagine looks very different from out there.
21:45
Yeah.
21:51
I feel like people cat call a lot less here than in Denver.
21:54
Like, I could not walk down the street, I could not leave the,
21:56
my house without being afraid.
21:59
But, here in Oregon in general, that hasn’t happened even a
22:03
fraction as much as where I grew up, which I thought was interesting.
22:08
I have nothing to relate it to because I haven’t lived anywhere else, but I’ve
22:11
been cat called here a couple times.
22:14
But, not to the extent of what you’re describing.
22:24
What issues do you think are most relevant, i.e. in need of
22:26
discussion and/or action to students who identify as females at OSU?
22:30
Can you
22:33
read it one more time?
22:46
Yeah.
22:47
Uh, what issues do you think are most relevant to students
22:50
who identify as female at OSU?
22:57
I think on every campus sexual assault is an issue.
23:00
Yeah.
23:00
Yeah, that’s the first thing that came to my mind.
23:03
But I feel like it, it just, I guess the question wording is, like,
23:08
everything is relevant, so why should we put something above anything else?
23:12
Yeah.
23:12
As most relevant.
23:13
Because it’s something more common I guess, speaking about sexual
23:16
assault and sexual violence.
23:18
But in other communities, what does that look like?
23:22
What other, what’re other salient circumstances that they face?
23:29
I wouldn’t have a specific one for that.
23:30
Because like, yeah, there are many, like, you can relate to.
23:34
And there’s not a single that is greater or more than another one.
23:39
Even gender inequity of women at work, women at different institutions,
23:44
how they’re treated and how they’re perceived, it’s in all matters.
23:49
Transwomen
23:50
Yeah.
23:51
And,
23:57
the thing that happened in Baltimore is a reflection of how, like, what’s
24:00
going on in society, and how unaware the society is of our issues.
24:06
Um,
24:12
so I guess that’s the eternal question for people in this work, right?
24:15
Like, what, what do we need to focus on right now?
24:18
What’s the most pressing?
24:20
And, what can we afford to take care of next week?
24:24
Yeah.
24:26
Only two more questions.
24:28
Is there anything that we have not discussed that you would like to add?
24:31
I
24:36
just want to echo, like, how much--we just have an amazing staff.
24:42
We have amazing people here, and I love you all.
24:45
And um, I really hope that every single year, whoever works here, they’re
24:50
as close as we’ve become this year.
24:53
I’m going to start crying, but.
24:54
But no, seriously, like, I--you all are just great.
25:01
Yeah my experience
25:08
is…
25:08
Continue.
25:08
No, but yeah.
25:09
I can totally relate to that.
25:11
I think all of us can.
25:13
Um, I don’t want to speak for others, but I think all of us
25:16
can because we’re so happy.
25:17
When it’s it time to work, I’m like, I’m going home.
25:22
It gives that feeling, you know.
25:24
It’s not the pressure, it’s not anything that you’re forced to do.
25:28
In fact, we have like this bond and emotional connection.
25:34
It’s great working at the women’s center.
25:36
It’s like a home away from home because I know no one in this
25:42
room has family in Corvallis.
25:45
And, family’s awfully far away for all of us.
25:49
So, especially for some of us.
25:51
So, I mean, just having a group of people that you know care about
25:55
you on shift, off shift, whenever you need somebody, they’re there.
25:59
They’re just a text away.
26:01
That’s true.
26:02
Yeah, someone who understands you, who’s there to listen to you, who
26:04
is there to support you in whatever cause, whatever that you want to do.
26:12
It feels good.
26:15
Someone that will protest alongside of you.
26:17
Someone that will
26:21
laugh at you when you fall.
26:22
Hold a sign.
26:23
It’s happened.
26:24
Yeah.
26:26
And, do you have any closing thoughts that you’d like to share?
26:30
I mean, I felt like that was some.
26:31
Sorry, I jumped ahead.
26:32
No, no, no.
26:34
I think they’re highly related.
26:40
I’m
26:46
lucky to have this place.
26:49
Yeah.
26:50
Any closing remarks, narrator?
26:53
Thank you for participating,
26:56
and I’m going to shut the video off now.
26:59
Watch, the video will have stopped a long time ago.
27:02
No.
