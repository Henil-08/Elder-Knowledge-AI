00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández.
00:03
I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian, a staff member with OSU’s Special
00:08
Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:10
Today’s date is May 13, 2014, and I am interviewing Mohamed Shaker, a staff
00:17
member of the Asian and Pacific Cultural Center at Oregon State University.
00:23
So let’s get started.
00:25
Can you please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:30
My name is Mohamed Shaker.
00:43
What is your hometown, or where is “home” for you?
00:47
I was born in Singapore and a lot of my family on my mother’s side
00:51
still lives in Singapore, so I consider that a kind of home for me.
00:55
But my parents live in Abu Dhabi in the UAE and I went to college there, and
01:02
my immediate family still lives there.
01:04
I would consider that currently home for me.
01:08
What is your age, your year in school, and your major?
01:12
I am currently 19 years old, I’m in my second year at OSU, but I am a junior.
01:19
My major, I am a double major in history and sociology, currently,
01:23
with a minor in Asian studies.
01:26
And what are your self-identities in terms of race and ethnicity?
01:32
In terms of race I would describe myself as a mixed race.
01:34
My father is Middle Eastern and my mother is Asian.
01:38
By ethnicity I am also mixed.
01:39
My father is Arab and my mother
01:45
Malay.
01:45
I identify myself as mixed, I associate myself with both identities equally.
01:51
So in terms of your work with the Asian Pacific Cultural Center, the APCC, what
01:57
is your position and what do you do?
02:00
My current position with the APCC is I am the community outreach coordinator.
02:09
What that entails, to explain, we currently have activities coordinators,
02:15
we have two of them, and those two do events just with the center.
02:23
My job, on the other hand, is to reach out to the other centers and to other
02:26
groups on campus, and I’ll plan events with them and I’ll touch base with them.
02:33
While we have an external coordinator who also does that, my job is to
02:37
reach out to the other community outreach coordinators and we plan
02:40
events, and I plan events with them.
02:43
So my job is really to kind of make those connections that are kind
02:47
of lower, less institutional level than the external coordinator.
02:50
It’s a position that I really like because I’ve gotten the ability to kind of
02:53
interact with all these different people.
02:55
And how long have you worked with the APCC?
02:57
This is my first year with the APCC, but I will be working here next year as well.
03:04
And this position that you have, the community outreach coordinator,
03:08
is it a new position, or has this position existed in the past?
03:12
This position has existed in the past, I don’t know for how long,
03:16
because we do a lot of reorganization and renaming of the positions.
03:20
But this position has existed, to my knowledge, for at
03:23
least the past three years.
03:27
And have you worked for any of the other cultural centers?
03:31
I have not worked for any of the other cultural centers, but I did work as
03:35
an administrative assistant in the main office of Diversity Development.
03:41
That’s the office that oversees all the cultural centers.
03:43
That’s the office that oversees all of us.
03:45
I was an admin.
03:47
assistant where I just did basic office work there.
03:50
Why did you decide to work at the APCC?
03:55
I decided to work at the APCC because, well for a lot of reasons.
04:00
I kind of wanted the chance to work with this center because a big part of it was
04:10
my identity as Asian; I really wanted to make connections with other Asian students
04:17
on campus, and to see what we could build once we made those connections.
04:23
I see my work at,
04:28
my decision to work at the APCC wasn’t just something that I felt
04:32
was natural, like, oh, you know, because I’m Asian I’ll work there.
04:36
It was a deliberate choice that I made because I wanted to build community
04:39
here and I wanted to reach out to all the other cultural centers.
04:42
I think people,
04:46
maybe people who don’t come to the centers often, don’t see the work that
04:49
we do, and don’t see the power that we build here among students on campus.
04:54
It’s important to remember we do have that power, especially because the cultural
04:58
centers are institutions on campus, there not just student organizations.
05:02
I wanted to work within that setting and I wanted to be a
05:05
part of this center, especially in the time of a lot of changes.
05:08
So there were a lot of reasons of why I decided to come work here.
05:11
So you mentioned this a little bit in terms of your expectations and hopes to
05:15
build community, in addition to that and if you expand a little bit on that, what
05:20
were your expectations and hopes, and were they matched, surpassed, not matched?
05:27
So when I was accepted to work here as the community outreach coordinator, a major
05:38
goal I had set for myself was that I wanted to hit, not hit, at least have
05:43
one event with the centers every quarter.
05:46
Unfortunately that wasn’t able happen just because of scheduling difficulties
05:49
and stuff, but I’m glad to say that I did, if not plan events with each
05:53
center, that I did manage to make really close connections with each of the
05:57
other community outreach coordinators, and that’s something that I really
06:02
like about my specific position.
06:05
With the reorganization next year, I don’t know how exactly that’s going
06:08
to work for students, but for me right now, it was such a great opportunity
06:12
to, especially with the current location of the APCC on the outskirts
06:17
of campus, it’s really difficult to have that physical connection.
06:20
So to be able to go to the other centers and be present there on a
06:24
regular basis, that was something that I didn’t expect to have a lot of,
06:28
but it was something that I loved and that I cherished about this position.
06:32
Other than that, I really wanted to build
06:37
community centers; I wanted to make really strong connections with the other people.
06:44
We’re a family here at Diversity Development and I really wanted
06:47
to be a part of that, I think that was definitely surpassed.
06:52
Everyone’s been really great and I think we’ve had a great year and I think we’ll
06:57
have a lot of other great years to come.
07:01
Internally, however, with the APCC, what I wanted to do was
07:04
kind of lay a foundation…maybe that’s the wrong way to put it.
07:09
I wanted to kind of,
07:12
my interest in my event planning, was I wanted to bring a real kind of
07:19
social justice element to the APCC.
07:22
We do a lot of cultural programming, we do a lot of, I don’t want to say
07:26
fun, that’s not the right word, but we do a lot of social events, sort
07:31
of culturally minded events, things that are not fun, but things that are
07:37
more, they engage you on a different level than the kinds of events, on
07:46
a different set of things, the kind that I want to engage in, which I wasn’t seeing.
07:50
I wanted to do that and I’m glad to say that I have been able to, and the other
07:55
staff, our activities coordinators and even our cultural center coordinator who
07:59
only plan one event a quarter, even they have really put in major effort into
08:03
creating a social justice program planning into our general program planning and
08:08
that’s what I thought we really needed and I’m glad to say that’s been surpassed.
08:12
Wonderful, well, this is the perfect lead into the next question.
08:16
Can you describe the projects, events, activities over this past year, the fall
08:23
term, winter term, and now spring term, that were especially meaningful to you?
08:29
Back in fall term
08:33
I had two events back in fall term.
08:35
One of them was a movie screening, and the movie that we screened was Tales of the
08:39
Waria which is a movie about non-western, non-binary gender in Indonesia.
08:46
For that it was a really big challenge because when you purchase a movie
08:52
for screening, it becomes much more expensive than if you were just
08:56
going to buy it for personal use.
08:58
So,
09:02
I had to go check out who could support us, and I’m glad to say
09:07
the Queer Studies program, which is still in its nascent stage here, it
09:12
only just started in the past year.
09:14
They were really supportive of us and the entire department, Women, Gender
09:18
and Sexuality was really supportive of us and they bought the movie for us.
09:22
That was really great just to have that kind of support and to start off my
09:27
year with the feeling that we had that kind of level of institutional support
09:31
behind us - that was really great.
09:35
It was a great success, we had a lot of students, which I was surprised to see
09:39
that many students because the topic is kind of obscure and I was able to make
09:43
a connection with the Pride Center.
09:45
So there were a lot of things that made it really special.
09:47
In
09:50
winter term I had two events also, one of them was about Guantanamo Bay.
09:56
I was really glad to
09:59
have that, not because…I’m
10:04
always weary of my position at the cultural center and I’m always
10:07
kind of critical, not critical, but I’m always thinking about what
10:12
it means to be an institution on campus rather than a student group.
10:16
What kind of strings come attached with that, what
10:21
kind of line we have to tow as an institution on campus that receives
10:27
money from the school, specifically which receives student fees.
10:30
What does that mean, what kinds of programming are we allowed to do, and with
10:34
that I didn’t feel like I was pushing the line, but I felt like this is a topic we
10:40
don’t engage with a lot and I was glad to get institutional support in that.
10:45
My co-workers here were very supportive and I managed to make
10:48
a really close connection with the people at the new cultural center,
10:51
which will be coming online next year at the Ettihad cultural center.
10:54
That meant a lot to me on an institutional level, and it was really great to have
10:58
that conversation, I feel like that was a really important issue to discuss.
11:04
The other event was “Black Power, Yellow Peril” and that was about seeing
11:10
the connections and the histories of solidarity between Asian Americans and
11:14
the Black Liberation Movement and that was really great also for all the reasons
11:18
I already listed you know I got to build a connection with them and we got
11:21
to really explore this hidden history.
11:24
Yeah, so I’ve only just started planning events and stuff for this course nothing
11:28
has really come up yet but I’m sure my events will be significant to me also.
11:34
Wonderful, so you mentioned this a little bit in terms of scheduling
11:39
challenges and sort of finding what the line is in terms of the projects
11:44
you can do being an institution, but can you expand a little bit on that?
11:48
Or share some of your challenges: what they have been and how you overcame them?
11:53
Yeah, a challenge that, like I said before has always been in my
12:00
specific position because I have to work with all these other people.
12:04
Scheduling is a challenge, even emailing is a challenge, I’m sure
12:09
everyone knows this, emailing is a challenge - just getting in contact
12:12
with people just sometimes just isn’t the easiest thing in the world.
12:15
So that was definitely a challenge and the way you overcome it, and I think
12:21
it’s important for future student worker employees to know this, that the way that
12:26
we do it, is, the way that we overcome it I feel is consistency and making, and by
12:35
constancy I mean if you can email reply to it or at least make a note that you
12:42
can reply to it, and don’t, and by and
12:47
by constancy I mean don’t suddenly reply, don’t - one minute you get
12:51
a minute then the next you reply then next you get a reply and
12:53
then for five hours you disappear.
12:55
Like that, you know, the constancy is in, you know, making sure you thought through
12:59
the email and giving yourself enough time to think about it and making that you know
13:03
that contact, and also, I cannot, I cannot stress this enough but physically being
13:09
in the other centers when you are planning events, physically going there and being
13:13
in those spaces, that’s really important.
13:15
We cannot, I cannot emphasis that enough.
13:19
Email and phone calls and weekly meetings those things are great but
13:24
nothing takes the place of just going there touching base, seeing what’s
13:28
up, see maybe why things go wrong.
13:30
I can give an example about this, I had a problem with when I was planning my event
13:35
with the Black Cultural Center during their heritage month there was a mistake
13:38
on the flyer and so someone from Diversity Development called me and said, “You know
13:42
we’re getting conflic-, you know, the, the program plan that you submitted doesn’t
13:47
match up with the information that was on the flyer so we want to know, you know,
13:51
what’s up?” So I knew that I hadn’t made a mistake when I, when I did that but I
13:57
didn’t immediately jump to conclusions and say, “Oh you know, they’re wrong” - No, I
14:00
went I checked my email and made sure that they had received the right information
14:04
then I went to the Black Cultural center and said, “You know I just got this
14:07
call you know what’s going on?” And they actually explained to me that there was
14:10
a mix-up that there was a typo they had gotten two - there were two events one
14:15
was right above the other and the time from the bottom one had just been taken.
14:19
So it’s about stuff like that, it’s about, making sure that you’re there and making
14:22
sure you’re touching base, keeping in touch that’s a very important thing to do.
14:29
But the other, the other, challenges that I have faced here were just, a
14:37
major problem that we always face is how do we get students to come to events
14:40
that aren’t necessarily, like I said before, culturally minded type things.
14:46
So in the past week I had an event, it was called “Queering the API Movement”
14:52
and I did it with the Pride Center. And it was about recognizing our LGBTQ
15:00
API figures where they are in our history and kind of contemplating why
15:04
they’ve been erased from our history.
15:07
And we also had a calligraphy workshop in the same week and you could
15:11
compare the attendance in those.
15:13
We got a lot more people at the calligraphy workshop
15:15
than we did at this one.
15:16
And I don’t, I am afraid that this might come off as condescending, I don’t mean it
15:21
in that way, but how do we get students, because these issues are important so
15:26
how do we engage students how do we meet students at their level you know?
15:32
It’s not that, I, I don’t think that calligraphy workshops aren’t important,
15:35
no, of course, no, of course they are very important for us we are a
15:39
cultural center it is import to us to make sure that students have, have,
15:42
have a veritable material connection with their culture that we provide.
15:47
But also how do we engage students, especially, yeah how do we engage students
15:54
with issues that are different than those?
15:57
How do we engage in issues of social justice?
16:00
I mean how do we do that?
16:01
That’s a major challenge.
16:02
And it’s not just my events, you know, we’ve had events throughout the year
16:05
we had another one about, I think it was about, about a generation?
16:11
Like generational gaps, and even that one you could see the same planners
16:16
the same people who planned that went and planned the calligraphy workshop
16:18
and you could just see the differences in attendance and in audience
16:22
participation in those kind of things.
16:24
So a major challenge has been how do we meet students at their level you know, how
16:27
do we engage the students at their level.
16:28
How do we engage them in these issues and I don’t have the
16:30
answer to that unfortunately.
16:31
But that is a challenge that,
16:35
school wide, country wide, you know it’s an issue that all of use as students,
16:41
as student leaders and employs is something that we have all grappled
16:43
with and it’s something that I hoped that, in my work here next here I
16:49
hope to really kind of work on that.
16:52
Great, so what do you consider your successes working at the APCC?
17:00
My successes…well, like I say I have been able to plan other events with a
17:06
lot of great people who are working in all the other cultural resources centers
17:08
- that will always be a success for me.
17:08
I guess another success is that…another success I would say
17:08
that I was able to get to know a lot of people in the API people in the
17:08
community that I didn’t know before.
17:08
We made a – and not just within the API community - the Oregon State University
17:08
community in general that isn’t specific to the cultural resource centers
17:22
you know, we make a lot of contacts we have or least I have in the past made
17:35
a lot of contacts with the people at ASOSU and the HSIC,
17:42
so it’s just been great to meet all these different people and especially since I
17:45
will be working here next year it’s great have those connections and to know all
17:48
those institutions know those peoples.
17:49
So that’s a major success I think, and I think just, I think everything we,
17:55
as trite as it sounds, I think that everything we do here is a success.
17:58
No matter how well attended our events are, no matter how well our reviews
18:04
are you know, no matter what I think everything we do here, everything we do
18:09
here is a successes in its own right.
18:13
And I feel a lot about my work and feel everything I have done in my work has
18:17
gone well and I am satisfied with it.
18:20
Great, so this next question in terms of your interactions with staff from the
18:25
other culture centers, it’s your job to interact with the other cultural centers.
18:29
Do you mostly interact with the other centers with people
18:33
that are in your same position?
18:34
Or do you go to other events even when you have nothing to do with them or do you
18:39
meet with the other staff members what are those other types of interactions like?
18:42
That’s a good question.
18:44
Mainly my interactions with the other staff are with the
18:47
other community coordinators just by virtue of my position.
18:50
But I do always enjoy attending other centers events.
18:53
I tried to - I was my, my work schedule and my class schedule was a lot friendlier
19:00
at the beginning of the year so I was able to go to a lot back in fall.
19:05
I was not able to go to too many in winter.
19:09
I have been going to more in this term you know, I was just
19:13
at the drag show and I was
19:18
the Ettihad Fair and I have been to some other events and I’ve been to other events
19:22
– APACU over the past month also - APASU is the Asian Pacific American Student Union.
19:28
So that’s all, that’s all been really nice but, I would say that I’ve, I have
19:35
the privilege in my position that I am able to go to those other centers and
19:38
meet those people and you know when you’re there, even though I mainly interact
19:42
with the community outreach coordinator of that specific center, of course there
19:46
are going to be other student employees there, there’s going to be other people
19:50
there, so I have been able to reach out to all these different people just
19:55
because I’ll be physically in a different center and that’s been really nice.
19:59
So yeah, I would say that my interactions with staff from the other centers has
20:05
been high over the past year and that’s been really nice and I hope that, I
20:11
hope that with our reorganization of student positions next year that that
20:15
element doesn’t, doesn’t go away.
20:17
I hope students can still do that because, you know, like I said before we are a
20:23
family here at the Diversity Development and it’s really easy to forget that
20:26
when were all in our separate buildings.
20:28
But it’s really important that we are all connected, we are all under
20:31
the same umbrella, but also we all share the common mission to work with
20:34
students of color on campus and other underprivileged students on campus.
20:37
So I hope that that aspect of my job doesn’t go away but rather gets diluted.
20:45
That’s great; so let’s talk about the new center.
20:52
The APCC had its groundbreaking ceremony earlier this term.
20:57
So can you talk a little about your role in the new center?
21:02
If you had a role and what the new center means to you?
21:06
So for the design process, I was not a part of the process.
21:13
For that I was able, because I was working at Diversity Development, I was able
21:17
to look at the sketches, I was able to kind of see it - not as it was forming
21:24
because I came on the team a little late.
21:25
But I got to see it as the design was being solidified of course in the past
21:30
year we have had the blue prints here so we’ve been able to look at them.
21:34
So I haven’t been a major part of the design process.
21:39
I spoke at ground breaking - that was really nice.
21:41
But other than that, the new center, what the new center means to me.
21:49
That’s a really big question [laughs] . The new center is I think…its, the
21:58
new center is…it’s something that the University, it’s something that
22:07
the University did not give to us but it’s something that the University,
22:12
it’s something that we worked for and something that we were owed.
22:18
Because the University, the University has issued a covenant that has been
22:23
signed by the former president I believe.
22:27
But the University signed to the covenant it commitment to the culture
22:32
resource centers on campus - that’s a commitment to us, it’s a commitment
22:36
to our thriving; it’s a commitment to being a presence on campus.
22:41
So when I think about the new center, the new center is really the
22:44
University honoring the commitment they have already made to us.
22:48
That is a commitment that was made because the University, because
22:51
students and concerned faculty spoke up how about, about problems
22:57
that were going about the cultural resource centers and the University.
23:00
So the University did not give this center to us it is a product
23:04
of a long time of hard work.
23:07
It is a major success for us, it’s like I just said, it’s taken so many
23:13
students and so many faculty that we don’t even know all of their names.
23:17
So
23:19
it’s, it’s all that, it’s the product of their work, so for us especially,
23:26
those of us who are staying on the APCC for next year it’s a really
23:30
big honor to get the center at this time and be able to hopefully be the
23:36
first staff to work at this center.
23:38
That’s so huge.
23:40
I can’t emphasis enough how much, how you know, how blessed we are that we
23:43
are able to work in the new center.
23:46
So the new center is like I said it’s the University honoring its
23:52
commitment but also something that we got and it’s something
23:56
we need to use and because all these students and all these faculty members
24:00
have worked so hard for it, it’s something that we need to use well, so the new
24:05
center is kind of like a trust, you know?
24:09
It is a symbol of the trust that those, that those people have put in us and
24:13
we need to honor that trust by doing our best and working for them, working
24:18
for ourselves, and working for the people who are going to come after us.
24:21
The new center means a lot to me and I am really excited to see it come up next
24:26
year, I am really excited to hopefully be one of the first people to work in it.
24:30
That’s a huge honor.
24:32
So a couple things to follow up.
24:34
Can you talk a little bit about your role in the ground breaking
24:38
ceremony - if you were selected or did you volunteer to speak at that?
24:43
Sure, I was asked to speak at the ground breaking ceremony because in
24:49
the initial, in the planning stages of how the program would look we didn’t
24:54
have a major student voice speaking.
24:57
I am also going to be the student leadership liaison
25:00
which replaces the external and internal coordinator of this year.
25:04
So I will be the student leadership liaison for next year so that’s kind
25:08
of, it’s kind of a big position, it’s a high you know, it’s one of the two
25:12
highest positions at the center so it was a honor to be asked but it was kind
25:18
of like, because I will be taking on a leadership role here next year they also
25:22
wanted my input into what it meant to me.
25:24
So
25:26
yeah, I was asked to speak.
25:29
I did a really short, I think it was only two or three minutes
25:31
long at the very end, yeah.
25:34
Great, and can you talk a little bit about the significance of
25:40
the center moving location.
25:42
Because the other three centers are staying were they originally
25:45
were but the APCC is moving towards the center of campus.
25:50
Can you talk a little bit about that?
25:52
Well like I said it’s the University honoring its commitment
25:55
it already made to students.
25:58
The current location of the APCC is
26:05
really not, it is nowhere near the center of campus.
26:10
We are, we are one of the, I think we are farthest northwest of something you can
26:18
really go on campus; we’re an outlier, we’re on the other side of a parking lot.
26:25
So it’s even really difficult for us to guide people to get here.
26:31
I know the first time I, I was walking here my freshmen
26:33
year I got lost, you know.
26:36
And I know it’s kind of funny but it’s a fact that a lot of the students
26:42
get lost coming here unfortunately it is because we are so far.
26:45
But like I said it’s the community honoring and the University
26:49
honoring its commitment to us by moving us closer to campus.
26:51
It’s, especially where we’ll be located, its right next to the NAL, it will be
26:56
down the road from the four Cs, it’s you know, it’s a really prime position.
27:02
It’s right next to the memorial union and the quad.
27:05
It’s a really good position to be in so
27:09
I am looking forward to having us so close on campus.
27:13
I hope to get, to boost our attendance at events but also to
27:16
boost our traffic just in general.
27:18
I hope that once were more of a presence on campus students, especially
27:21
API students, will see us more and gain that visibly and well get more
27:27
people to come and use our resources.
27:29
So yeah, so
27:33
that’s, the new location is really important and its, and it was
27:38
something that I think a lot of us really appreciated about the move.
27:42
If the university was going to build a new structure here,
27:47
we still would have been, we still would have been appreciative of it,
27:50
but it wouldn’t have meant as much as it would if we were to move towards
27:53
the center of campus were going to be at the heart of what’s going on.
27:59
So this next set of questions is all about ideas for the
28:02
future and the bigger picture.
28:04
Which is wonderful that you are going to continue working here next year.
28:08
So looking back, and also recommending for the future and this can be specific
28:12
to you or it can be ideas in general.
28:16
What projects, events, or activities would you have like to have seen?
28:19
So what would you recommend for the future?
28:25
What I would have liked t see….well, I would have liked for us to have
28:30
collaboration with all the other centers this year that would have been really nice
28:33
so I hope that next year that with the new student positions I hope that they will be
28:42
able to work with all the other centers.
28:44
So I hope that is something that I, I really hope for.
28:49
What I would like to see, what I would like to see more of next year, and
28:55
hopefully I myself can be a part of this is more of a connection between the APCC
29:00
and the API student groups on campus.
29:03
We have a, we have eighteen different API student groups and organizations,
29:09
so that’s a lot and I would just, and we all, all of us regularly meet up
29:17
and you know, so there is connection there but I would like to see more and
29:21
I would like to see closer, I would like to see more you know just some
29:27
more of that connection, just build more of a relationship, solidify the fact.
29:32
I feel like that on our end, we are an institution on campus, it you know, it’s
29:40
undeniable we have paid staff we you know, were a responsible, in we have
29:46
a hierarchy we have people responsible you know within our own institution
29:51
and within the University in general.
29:53
So were very bureaucratic in that way and I understand that’s, and I
29:57
at least that’s what I believe is a major cause of the gap between us.
30:02
Because a lot of individual staff, myself included, have really close friendships
30:06
and relationships with a lot of individual members of clubs but I wonder how we can
30:11
bring that onto an institutional level.
30:13
How can we as the APCC work closely with all these student groups because we are
30:16
really here for them this is our job.
30:18
So next year I would really like to build that relationship.
30:19
I would like to
30:22
see it, as far as events and activates go, we had a lot of really good things
30:27
um, this year unfortunately, unfortunately we didn’t have anything about…oh no, we
30:36
did hit it, so never mind about that.
30:37
But I would like to see, we have done a lot of physical events, that’s the
30:43
wrong way to put it, but we have a lot of, well we have had two, or we will
30:46
have two we have a type 2 workshop and we had a hip-hop workshop back in fall.
30:51
But I would like to see also a kind of a health minded events specifically with
30:58
health disparities within our community.
31:00
We table at the red dress fashion show, which raises money for the cause
31:07
of people suffering with HIV/AIDS.
31:09
So we have that connection there but I would like to see a full fledge
31:13
event about that because health is major concern in our community and is
31:17
something that we need to focus on.
31:21
Other than that, I would also, I would also like to see,
31:30
more events…I don’t want to say that I would like to see more social justice
31:40
type events, but I would like to see our staff kind of integrate those into the
31:44
programming that we regularly do anyway, so no matter what it is, if it’s something
31:49
like a hip hop workshop, you know how can we, there is a history behind hip hop you
31:53
know, there are a lot of issues behind it how can we bring that to the forefront.
31:56
And it was brought to the forefront which is something that I really appreciated
31:58
but how do we do that with all of our activities so that’s something that
32:01
I want to keep in mind for next year.
32:04
So what advice would you give future APCC staff or just other OSU
32:09
cultural center staff in general?
32:12
The advice that I want to give all the future APCC staff specifically and
32:21
that will this be up for next year?
32:23
Ok, at least that over the summer, I
32:29
will send this down to the staff and hopefully listen to it.
32:31
What I want all the APCC staff to remember is that this was not an
32:35
easy year for us as API students.
32:37
We lost two of our, two major faculty members who were the sources of huge
32:44
amounts of institutional advocacy for us.
32:48
We - so that really hit us hard, in terms of our ability to, and that will
32:58
continue to hit us hard into the next year, just in our ability to foster
33:03
like, like those two members, those two faculty members, they supervised
33:08
clubs, one of them was the associated director of the Diversity Development the
33:13
other was the head of the API Education Office, the API student services.
33:17
So these were major positions that were held by Asian women on campus and to lose
33:24
that, and not - those positions won’t be replaced by those same people so we
33:29
don’t have that level of institutional advocacy and support anymore.
33:32
So what I want students to remember for next year, for the next, for the
33:37
coming years also, is that working at the APCC I think a lot of students
33:41
think it’s a lot of fun and it’s been a great time, and I would never say that
33:45
working here has not been fulfilling.
33:47
But it is also a position that comes with a lot, all of the cultural
33:50
centers, it is a position that comes with a lot of responsibility it is a
33:55
position that comes with, yeah that’s the exact way to put it I think, it’s a
33:59
position that comes with responsibility.
33:59
Yeah, that’s how I’d put it, it’s a position that comes with responsibility.
34:01
As I have said multiple times already, we are an institution we have the
34:05
ability to go, you know hopefully we will be getting ASOSU representation
34:11
next year, we have the ability to do a lot of things just because we are a
34:14
recognized part of the campus in the way that student organizations aren’t.
34:19
So that means it’s our responsibility that when issues come up with API students
34:24
or with students of color in general that we are there and we are supporting
34:28
them and that we are at the forefront.
34:31
And what that means also that, that all future staff and what future staff need to
34:36
remember is that we are not just this job working here is not just you know, it’s
34:43
not just a good time and it’s not just for - it’s not just something cool to put
34:48
on your resume it’s not just something to show that you, you know have cultural
34:53
competency it’s not about, this isn’t about, this is a position that means a
34:58
lot to a lot of people and it’s a position that you need to be constantly thinking
35:05
when you’re in this position about what it means to be in this position in general
35:09
and what it means to be a student leader.
35:11
You know what it means to have that power what it means to have
35:16
that ability, those abilities.
35:18
So my recommendation is to, my advice to all future APCC staff is to
35:22
really think about that and when you think about that and make sure that
35:27
becomes a part of the programming that you do and part of the work that
35:30
you do make it apart of your life.
35:31
Because we here at the APCC, you know we are probably never, at least not
35:36
in the short run, were not going to be recuperate the institutional loss
35:40
that we have suffered this year.
35:42
So it’s important for us as student leaders to step up our game and
35:45
to make sure that we are filling in that gap for our students.
35:51
And so just to follow up the two positions that were both women moved
35:58
on to other positions it was Victoria [Nguyen] and Sandy [Tsuneyoshi], correct?
36:02
Yes.
36:03
So can you expand just a little bit more on that, in terms of the significance of
36:09
having API role models and leadership.
36:14
And what happens when you don’t have that?
36:18
Well anyone can tell you Aunty Sandy and Victoria have always
36:22
been there for students of color in general, but they have specifically
36:24
worked with us as the API students.
36:28
Not having…well not having those people there means that a lot of things
36:38
that the University might do that we might be unaware of here, we
36:41
don’t have those people who are in the mix of it at all times.
36:45
So you know, the things you know, things might come up with our budget, things
36:53
might come up with the kind of programing we want to do, things
36:55
might come up with the funding for our student groups you know, just these
36:59
kind of things on an institutional level and I am really speaking at an
37:02
institutional level here because I think that it’s important to remember that
37:04
they were working at a institution.
37:06
You know those things that come up you know, were very insulated
37:10
from them as student workers.
37:11
Losing that means the loss of people who will say, “Wait, you know you can’t do
37:18
that” or “Wait, you forgot about this” you know, in a way that we can’t over here.
37:24
So losing Victoria and Aunty Sandy I mean, that on that level it’s really
37:29
hard but also, of course Aunty Sandy and Victoria are always going to apart of
37:34
the community you know, there still very much involved with everything we do here.
37:39
But just, but losing, losing them as constant physical presences on campus
37:45
and that I have to say that was a little bit demoralizing over the past
37:49
year its, it hasn’t been easy to kind of, it hasn’t been easy to lose that
37:55
to just lose the fact that you know, there were these strong wonderful
38:00
caring API women who were really leading the charge on so many things.
38:04
Victoria was our boss, like it cannot be denied that she was always she
38:10
always fought for us as cultural resource centers in general it can’t,
38:14
we can’t ever forget about that.
38:16
So I mean losing them has physical presences on campus that has really I
38:19
think, at least on a personal level that really hit me hard especially because
38:23
I worked really close with Victoria that that really hit me, but losing
38:28
that I think has kind of, it’s kind of shook all of us especially with all
38:33
the changes that are occurring within the APCC all the changes that are
38:36
going within the Intercultural Student Services and how that affects student
38:40
groups its hit all of us and not to have them there as a kind of stabilizing
38:44
forces that’s been really difficult.
38:46
So
38:48
and its even, it’s been a little bit more difficult knowing that we won’t
38:52
be able to get back people with their experience and their knowledge and their
38:57
just, just their position on campus.
39:01
So that’s been really tough, but I’m optimistic because I think that students
39:06
will rise to the challenge and hopefully in the next year, of course we have
39:11
the new professional staff at the
39:16
APCC and I know that we as a, as a community of cultural resource centers,
39:22
we are going to come out of this better and I am sure within the APCC and all
39:26
the API student groups I already see it you know, people are really taking the
39:31
charge and stepping up and taking on more responsibility so even though it hit us
39:34
hard I am confident in our resilience.
39:40
So based on working here at the APCC, what is the take away if you can’t
39:45
just think of one, you can name more if you like, that you have gained that
39:49
you would like to share with others?
39:53
The
39:55
main takeaway that I have gained in the past year is that, is that we
40:05
really are part of a community here, not just here within specific community
40:14
that we serve or within just the cultural resource centers or even just
40:18
students of color here at Oregon State University, but we really are part a
40:24
larger movement of students of color and people of color across the country.
40:30
This is, it’s really easy to kind of forget about it because you know, for a
40:36
lot of reasons it’s really easy to just forget that were part of a collective
40:41
movement - that were fighting for common goals with a lot of other people.
40:48
And so that has been the biggest takeaway.
40:51
I was able to go three different conferences over the past year and
40:53
just to be in places with all the other students, you’re all working towards the
40:57
same thing it really reminds you that the work were doing here that’s important.
41:01
And that’s the major takeaway and that’s something that you know, if I could go
41:02
back to the last question, it’s something that I want future staff to remember the
41:07
work that we do here is very important it’s not, it’s not work that you know,
41:15
it’s not just what you do here it’s not just done and it vanishes it dissipates
41:23
or something you know the work we do here it lays foundations for future students
41:28
for future people you know in general.
41:30
So it’s been really wonderful to feel a part of that greater community but
41:37
it’s also I think that’s something that we need to keep in mind.
41:41
So in a way you’ve answered this, but what is your biggest issue in
41:47
terms of the purpose of the APCC?
41:49
Why is it important that the University uphold its covenant?
41:54
Why is it important that the APCC be institutional as you have mentioned.
42:01
So the biggest issue in terms of purpose with the APCC, the biggest
42:07
issue, could you explain kind of what you mean about biggest issue?
42:12
Well, why do you think why that APCC should exist, as a physical
42:17
center, as a part of the University on an institutional level as you’ve
42:22
been describing it - why is that?
42:25
So if you had to state your case to someone who said, “Why do we need
42:29
cultural centers?” Maybe someone at a university who doesn’t have them,
42:34
why would you say that you need them?
42:36
Ok, well I think that we have, with the
42:45
construction of all the new centers we have faced that question of “why
42:50
do we need these cultural centers?
42:52
Why do we need new cultural centers?
42:54
Why
42:57
is the University building these cultural centers?” And of course those
43:04
students are also and just people in general are forgetting that at the
43:08
same time the University is building a new APCC we are also receiving a new
43:12
college of business and a new first year experience center and a new student dorm.
43:17
So,
43:19
and we just completed construction on the new international living learning
43:24
center in just the past couple years.
43:27
So the, and
43:31
the biggest issue of that question, and to answer the question that I have gotten
43:36
and I know that a lot of other people have gotten is that its, it speaks from
43:41
a place of ignorance that it seems that the university is just giving this to us
43:46
it seems that we haven’t done anything to receive these, to receive this center
43:52
or the other center it seems that the University is just donating this to us
43:56
and of course that is not the case at all.
43:59
But the biggest reason that we need cultural centers and what I have and what
44:03
I will always say to people who ask this question is that there is no drawback to
44:09
having these cultural centers on campus.
44:12
Everyone has benefited from a diverse campus in which all students
44:16
are respected and all students have the ability to pursue their
44:20
educational, personal, professional goals to their fullest extent.
44:24
Nobody is harmed, everybody benefits from this fact.
44:29
And for the question of why do we specifically need these cultural centers
44:34
you know, that also speaks from a place of ignorance because of course
44:38
students of color, you know when we don’t have these spaces for advocacy,
44:43
when we don’t have committed student employees and committed faculty members
44:47
who are willing to do and are willing to put in the time and effort and energy
44:53
into working for students of color, students of color become marginalized
44:57
I think at a rapid and alarming speed.
45:02
Even with these cultural centers you know, our University is the only one
45:07
in the state that has specific cultural centers for each different racial group.
45:12
So in the whole state usually places just have multicultural centers.
45:16
So even with the presence of all these different cultural centers
45:22
you know, I would say that we are a fairly visible presence even with
45:26
that we still face problems, that not to say that these problems go away.
45:30
In the past five months you know we’ve had to deal with some really awful stuff
45:38
happening, you know racist messages written on the walls, racists messages
45:43
given to other cultural centers, you know these things don’t magically
45:48
disappear because, students of color,
45:54
issues won’t go away just because we have these cultural centers.
45:57
And that makes it even more important to have them here for
46:00
us to be able to respond to them.
46:03
And I would say that also its really important to remember
46:09
that these cultural centers,
46:13
it’s something that people misconstrue a lot, these cultural centers aren’t clubs
46:18
-we are actively working for students, our main goal to retain students you
46:27
know, specifically at the APCC we have a problem, well not a problem, but our
46:33
community is very diverse and so you know, and the dropout rates even in high school
46:41
for Pacific Islander students or Southeast Asian students particularly, and this is
46:46
a general rule, particularly students who are the children or who are themselves
46:53
first generation of immigrants or refugees who come from war torn areas or have
46:58
come from displaced regions of the world.
47:00
That is something that, that is something that we need to work on
47:05
these cultural centers aren’t here so we can have a club house they’re not
47:09
here so that we can have a good time.
47:10
No were here to work for students we need to make sure were serving, were
47:13
here to serve students and were serving them in the best way possible for them.
47:17
So that is a really big answer I think to that question, but there’s a lot
47:21
of issues and there’s a lot of things going into why this center and other
47:26
cultural centers are very important.
47:29
So you’ve touched upon this, with that previous answer, but can you go
47:34
a little bit more in-depth in terms of the impact of the APCC on Asian Pacific
47:40
Islander students here on campus?
47:44
I would say that, API students, at
47:49
least the ones I have been able to make connections with over here,
47:52
I think that they like having this place just because it’s a place that
47:58
recognizes them; it’s a place that gives them visibility that I think
48:05
they would have otherwise been denied.
48:08
I
48:10
think it’s also for a lot of API students, especially other API student leaders on
48:15
campus it’s also just like is, like I have been saying it’s a physical representation
48:20
of a commitment that the University has made to us and it’s really important that
48:24
the University is honoring the commitment and work that our predecessors have made.
48:28
So, and I think on
48:34
a moral level it’s just nice to just come here sometimes you know?
48:39
It’s, even like I said right before this this is not a club house but this
48:42
is a place that students come to meet other students, lounge around and just
48:49
sort of feel at home and feel accepted, feel like it’s a place for them.
48:53
That just a major thing on just like a psychological level I
48:59
think that API students just feel better because we exist.
49:06
So you’ve mentioned that your projects and your events are for the
49:10
greater OSU and local communities.
49:12
So can you describe the impact of the APCC on the larger OSU
49:18
community and perhaps even beyond that the Corvallis area community?
49:23
On the
49:26
greater OSU community I would say that,
49:32
were just, were one of like as a, it’s already known, were one of six official
49:39
cultural resource centers on campus.
49:42
I remember when we had the “I too am OSU” student march you know that was
49:48
organized the centers around moving between the different cultural centers.
49:51
And that was really symbolic to me about what this, this place means like on a
49:56
school level you know, these cultural resource centers, and even the APCC
50:00
this, they are places for us to, to build power and to share experiences
50:07
and to feel you know, just to feel safe and to feel like we can have a
50:12
say and we can, you know we can you now, it’s a place to promote ourselves.
50:19
So on the greater OSU community just to have them, just to have
50:27
the march come all the way out here that’s really symbolic and that’s students
50:30
recognizing that this is a place that they can come and students recognize that
50:33
this is a place serving students of color.
50:35
And that’s the biggest impact I think it’s had on the greater OSU community and
50:40
that’s true, not just for the APCC, but for all the cultural resource centers.
50:45
Within the local community, it’s a little bit difficult to make contact with the
50:49
local community just because, well just because it’s a little bit difficult
50:55
to make contact with them in general.
50:56
It’s just difficult to you know, where do we advertise how do we intentionally
51:02
go about advertising ourselves to them.
51:04
But I would say that some of the events that other cultural groups put on,
51:09
those are really community events for instance the luau we had last month
51:12
that was really well attended, not just by students or faculty of Oregon State
51:18
but the entire Corvallis community.
51:20
So that was something that hit the broader community.
51:25
And do you have any suggestions or ideas in terms of future collaborations
51:29
with the broader OSU and local communities so outside of, in addition
51:35
to working with the cultural centers.
51:38
I would love for us and I think that this is something that I hope;
51:45
this is something I hope to work on.
51:47
I would we have an advisory board here that is of faculty on campus
51:54
and of some community members.
51:56
But what I would like to do is see more of a connection between the
52:00
work that we as students do here at the cultural centers and within
52:04
the cultural groups and faculty.
52:08
Specifically the faculty of programs like ethnic studies,
52:12
women gender sexuality studies, queer studies, anthropology - these
52:18
departments whose work revolves around us.
52:24
I would like to see us have more of a connection with them
52:30
- you know, their work really does,
52:34
especially with ethnic studies with the APCC it’s really wonderful to
52:40
have the ethnics studies program in place and I know a lot of API
52:44
students take ES 231 or 233 which are the Asian American studies courses.
52:49
A lot of them are just, their awareness of our history and our current issues
52:54
are just magnified because of that.
52:56
I would like to see more of a connection built between us and the faculty.
53:01
And I think that through that we get to the greater community because you know,
53:07
like with the example of my collaboration with queer studies back in the fall having
53:12
that connection with the professor in queer studies that brought people to my
53:16
event that got us exposure you know, and
53:21
that gave legitimacy to the work that we do here and that’s really important.
53:24
The faculty I think,
53:30
because their support legitimizes the work that we do and our support
53:33
of them particularly for programs like ethnic studies whose funding
53:37
is always really precarious our support of them is really crucial.
53:41
Ethnic studies programs were only developed because of students of
53:43
color in the 60s and through the third world liberation front we
53:46
fought for ethnic studies programs.
53:48
So we need to continually build and continue to maintain
53:50
building relationships with them and that’s a major thing
53:56
that I see with the OSU community.
53:59
With the local community it’s a little bit difficult to think of what I want
54:04
to do with the local community - like I said they show up to these really
54:10
kind of big events, big cultural shows that we do and that’s really good and
54:17
I think that’s the relationship I would like to have with them at the moment.
54:23
I would like to kind of, you know, if there are any local organizations
54:27
that are working with people of color I would like for us to seek those out
54:33
and see how we can build together.
54:36
For the moment I think that we have the appropriate relationship
54:41
with the local community.
54:44
Can you describe your thoughts on why, if you think this, if you think that
54:49
sharing your stories is an important part of your identity and why you
54:53
think it’s important to share your history and the history of the APCC?
54:58
It’s really important for us to share this story and I think for us to share
55:04
this story of the APCC so that students don’t forget that this was something
55:13
that students fought for and students worked for and you know, when we forget
55:22
the history of the APCC it becomes just another building on campus, just
55:26
something else the University just a little house on the corner on campus that
55:30
the University decided to buy one day.
55:32
Well of course that wasn’t the case; the University was intentionally acquired
55:38
through the deliberate work of students and when we remember that, we remember
55:43
that we need to always be advocating for ourselves and for other students.
55:50
I think there was an example that was just shared with me recently about some money
55:54
that because, of course ISS’s structural change are going on, Intercultural
55:58
Student Services, is going through several structural changes and there was some
56:02
money that we’re looking at to use as just an end of year celebration and we’re
56:08
wondering was going to go at the moment.
56:12
And Aunty Sandy shared this with me right before this and showed me that
56:17
this was something that students really intentionally acquired from, I
56:24
can’t remember his name but he was the president back in 2002 or something,
56:28
but back then after a particularly racist incident had occurred on campus,
56:33
it was in 1996, students went to the
56:36
president and asked for and acquired money so that we could use this for
56:43
general, for programs that are outside just budget that the APCC receives.
56:47
And you know we were just thinking about that money and we were thinking that, “Oh
56:51
it might go away and what are we going to do about the end of year celebration and
56:56
how are we going to have that?” And Aunty Sandy reminded us that that was money that
56:59
the students worked for and that kind of gave a lot of us, it gave me especially
57:04
the motivation that we need to get that money we need to secure that money.
57:07
And that’s just a general thing you know when we remember that
57:11
when students, when we remember the work that students do and why we’re
57:16
here and what we need to fight for.
57:18
On a general level sharing stories, I see a lot of power in sharing stories,
57:24
sharing stories really struggles the hegemonic narratives they really you
57:30
know, it really gives us visibility that
57:36
we want, if that makes sense.
57:38
And not visibility, not the visibility that harms us, visibility
57:42
that we intentionally seek out and provide for ourselves.
57:45
So that’s really important.
57:48
I myself I think that sharing stories
57:55
is something that is really good, like I went to the racial aikido retreat
58:01
back in January and that was a really great time for a lot of students to
58:04
share their experiences being students of color and just being people of
58:07
color and navigating those spaces.
58:10
I remember that I didn’t share many personal stories just because, not
58:13
that I didn’t feel comfortable or safe because that was a really wonderful
58:16
group of people, but because I didn’t really feel like sharing stories was
58:21
a way for me personally to build power but I recognize and I love that it’s
58:27
a way for all these other students to.
58:29
So sharing stores is really important and it’s just a way
58:33
for us to you know, to recognize commonality and build solidarity.
58:38
So you’ve described a couple of incidents that occurred this year pertaining
58:45
to some issues in terms of racial and ethnic identities and unfortunately some
58:55
issues and incidents of racial intolerance.
58:59
So could you describe those experiences?
59:03
Those were more general experiences and if you want to share any
59:07
of your personal experiences?
59:11
Well, I think
59:15
Oregon State University, I think most students at Oregon State University have
59:21
kind of a, I don’t want to say warped, but they have a little bit of skewed
59:28
idea of what the University looks like.
59:32
And I think it’s because the University of course in the past ten years has
59:36
been made a very obvious and deliberate effort to recruit students from out
59:41
of the country and out of the state.
59:43
I think a third of the campus is out of state, something like
59:44
20 to 30 percent of the campus
59:49
is drawn from outside of Oregon.
59:51
And that wasn’t some, that wasn’t; I think that students think
59:55
that was something that just happened because it just happened.
59:58
But no, that was a deliberate effort made by the University.
1:00:01
So when students say things like, “Oh there you know, there are a lot
1:00:06
of Chinese people now, there are a lot of Arab students” - that’s
1:00:11
coming from a place of ignorance because that was something that the
1:00:13
University intentionally set out to do.
1:00:17
Not just because having a diverse campus benefits everyone but because
1:00:21
you know there is greater profit to be made from out of state students.
1:00:26
Because out of state students pay triple tuition, they help fund the
1:00:31
APCC through their tuition money.
1:00:34
This is money that is
1:00:37
just money that the University went out specifically to go get.
1:00:41
So that is a major thing that students often forget that the racial makeup
1:00:47
on campus is still overwhelmingly white and that it just so happens that
1:00:53
because we tend to associate white students with neutral we associate
1:00:58
them with kind of being the default.
1:01:01
These other students, students of color, specifically students of color
1:01:05
who come from out of the country and who because they come from out of the
1:01:10
country tend to just stick together you know, it’s a natural thing to want to do.
1:01:16
That they become, these students become so much more visible, and it’s not
1:01:22
these students’ fault – I’d never say that - it just so happens that because,
1:01:27
it just so happens that they are just more visible and it just becomes this
1:01:32
kind of spiral of, “Oh, there seem to be a lot more students of color on
1:01:35
campus, that must mean that’s why they are building the new cultural centers.
1:01:39
Oh, look at all these things that are being diverted from us.” And it’s like,
1:01:45
and it ignores everything that I have been saying about the intentional work
1:01:49
that students have done and the work, and the specific you know, the specific
1:01:56
goal of the University in recruiting out of state students which has, it’s
1:02:01
a major thing the University has done.
1:02:02
I remember I was remarking to one of my coworkers you know we have a lot
1:02:07
of students from Hawaii here, why does so many students from Hawaii?
1:02:11
It just seems like Oregon, the climate of Oregon is so much different from
1:02:16
Hawaii why would students come here.
1:02:18
Oh, the University goes and makes sure it’s a presence in Hawaii.
1:02:21
So it’s,
1:02:24
its, it come from a place of ignorance and a very dangerous ignorance that
1:02:30
students ask, “Why do we have all these, you know, all these students of color?
1:02:37
Why do we have all these immigrants?” And that, and unfortunately, that
1:02:41
reinforces the racism and phobia that is already present in this country, that’s
1:02:49
a really general thing that I observe.
1:02:53
But on a specific level I think that there’s a tendency among students and
1:03:00
it’s not just a tendency, I think Oregon is a very well, at least western Oregon,
1:03:05
is in its own way a very “liberal” area and unfortunately “liberalism”
1:03:13
I guess comes with its pitfalls.
1:03:17
The University makes a really big effort to promote multiculturalism
1:03:22
and diversity and somehow, in, I think a lot of students’ mindset
1:03:28
that – that becomes equated with anti-racist work - it’s not necessarily.
1:03:37
It’s certainly, it’s certainly advantages but it doesn’t necessarily
1:03:44
mean we’re undoing those structures.
1:03:47
And so when, so like I said when students see all these students of color, the
1:03:52
immediate thought is they’re getting benefits, they’re getting advantages,
1:03:56
they are getting things that we aren’t getting and that’s dangerous way for
1:04:02
a lot of students to think because those, you know, whether or not students
1:04:09
believe it, student have power on this campus you know - students who think
1:04:13
we have too many student of color that influences the hiring processes,
1:04:18
admissions processes, that changes things for us, so that’s what I see a lot of.
1:04:23
There’s a huge emphasis that the University places on multicultural and
1:04:26
diversity and not enough of an emphasis on actually you know working on you know,
1:04:33
working on undoing racism, undoing sexism, and homophobia, and all these things.
1:04:40
So that’s I think that’s a really those are really general points, but I think
1:04:47
they become replicated in the way that a lot of students just go about their day,
1:04:53
“Oh a new” – I remember last year someone was like, “Oh, there’s a new longhouse;
1:04:57
oh, why is there a new longhouse?” And the irony is so prevalent because the
1:05:04
new longhouse is right there but of course the new college of business is
1:05:07
being built right across the street from it, but no one is asking, “Why are
1:05:11
we getting a new college of business?
1:05:12
It seems like there are more college of science students then there
1:05:15
are college of business, right?
1:05:16
And there are more agriculture students, more forestry students - why are we
1:05:20
getting a new college?” No one is asking that question, but everyone’s asking,
1:05:25
“Why are we getting a new longhouse?” And, I would like this to be on the
1:05:29
record [laughs] - you know the longhouse was basically this little trailer thing
1:05:33
on the corner of what was it 26th and Jefferson for what, 30 years or something?
1:05:38
That’s, that’s nothing – that was a pittance – the University – that isn’t
1:05:44
the University honoring commitment to diversity, that’s the University,
1:05:46
you know, superficially honoring, superficially paying lip service to it.
1:05:51
Building the new center is honoring a commitment and that’s just something
1:05:54
that students need to start reflecting on a lot, you know, it’s not alright
1:06:00
to be ignorant of these issues and of – you know, our University looks
1:06:06
the way it does because of really deliberate decisions made by specific
1:06:09
people and specific organizations on campus and so when you think about,
1:06:14
“Oh, why are there so many immigrant students or so many foreign students?
1:06:19
You know, it’s something the University wanted and I think we also need to stop
1:06:23
this idea that students of color – you know it’s an idea that we have a lot
1:06:28
in this country – that when people of color get something, we have only got
1:06:33
it because we took it from the white majority and that’s not the case.
1:06:38
We did not take anything from other students by building a new Asian Pacific
1:06:43
Cultural Center, in fact everyone is going to be benefited because we live
1:06:47
– we go to a university that has an Asian Pacific Cultural Center – everyone
1:06:51
is going to be benefitted because we’re working on undoing these systems
1:06:55
and gaining you know, long – these advantages that have been denied to
1:07:00
students of color for a very long – historically denied to students of color.
1:07:04
So you know, those are, like I said, those are really general things,
1:07:07
but that’s kind of what I see here.
1:07:09
That’s great, thank you.
1:07:11
So, and you mentioned the Solidarity March that took place, that the APCC
1:07:16
was one of the stops on that march – can you talk a little bit about either your
1:07:21
role or the APCC role of that and did you go and participate in the march?
1:07:27
Or can you just talk about your experience with that?
1:07:29
I wasn’t a huge part of the march, but I was able to join for a little
1:07:33
bit, but I had class during that time.
1:07:35
I had a – I think I had a midterm during that time – so I wasn’t a huge
1:07:39
part of that and I would never want to claim any sort of major role in that
1:07:45
because that was done by a lot of other students particularly out community
1:07:48
relations facilitators on campus, you know, they really – and people who work
1:07:54
within housing and dining and people in the other cultural centers – those
1:07:57
were the people who really stepped up.
1:08:01
But with the Solidarity March, that was just really nice to see in general.
1:08:06
It was just nice to see students you know really working together.
1:08:11
And I have to say that that was – there were a lot of things that were really
1:08:18
good about that march but there were some things that – not some
1:08:21
things that I disagree with but some things that I was a little weary of.
1:08:25
So, and I don’t know, this is going to go on the record, so this might sound
1:08:28
bad, but I remember that President Ed Ray showed up to join the march for a
1:08:34
little bit – I wasn’t there during the time he was there, but he was there at the
1:08:36
march for a little bit – and I remember, I remember when I saw the paper, The
1:08:40
Barometer came out the next day with a whole thing about the march and his
1:08:44
picture was there and I said, “Well, hmmm, you know, President Ed Ray has the power
1:08:50
to help us out a lot, you know him going to the march is great, but how, how is he
1:08:55
going to translate his attendance at the march to actual work?” You know, and that
1:08:58
was something that – and of course the march, the march is just, I think people
1:09:03
put a lot of emphasis on marches, you know, because they’re so obvious and so
1:09:10
visible, but the march is just the most visible component, you know “I too am
1:09:15
OSU” has, you know, continued – they built a lot of spaces for community dialogue,
1:09:20
you know, in responding to certain, in responding to the recent, the homophobic
1:09:25
comments made by a candidate who was running for ASOSU president, you know,
1:09:29
they really stepped up, I think within the next day after that article came out
1:09:35
there was already a space for community – that dialogue about what was going
1:09:38
on, you know, “how can we strategize?
1:09:40
What should we do?
1:09:41
How can we help each other heal?” So, you know, obviously the march, the march
1:09:44
is just one part of a broader movement on campus so that’s how I see it and I
1:09:51
hope that, I hope that because I think a lot of, it’s always really lovely
1:09:55
to see people, to see faculty attend.
1:10:00
I remember I saw at the community dialogue after the, after the comments
1:10:04
made by the ASOSU candidate, you know, I saw at the dialogue Dr. Allison Davis
1:10:11
White-Eyes of Intercultural Student Services attending – and it was really
1:10:14
just nice to see her there, you know, she did a lot of great work with us and
1:10:17
that was, it was really empowering just to see her, just to see her be there.
1:10:22
But I always, but I don’t want to say suspicious, but I’m always a little
1:10:25
weary of when people, when faculty especially, when they come out, and
1:10:31
I wonder what, how they’re going to translate that into actual support for us.
1:10:34
And I can give you an example because in the last Solidarity March
1:10:37
and at the, after those comments were made the Department of Women,
1:10:41
Gender, and Sexualities actually issued two statements, one for each
1:10:48
event that, you know, it was a statement of solidarity and it was signed by all the
1:10:53
faculty members of the department and that was a department and that was just amazing
1:10:58
to see that – that is something, you know, that is translating their presence at the
1:11:02
march, their presence at the dialogue into something, you know, something feasible,
1:11:05
that’s power – that’s having faculty who are willing to advocate for us.
1:11:09
So that was wonderful to see.
1:11:13
So is there anything that we have not discussed that you would like
1:11:17
to add or anything that we’ve talked about that you want to expand on?
1:11:24
Not really.
1:11:28
I think I’ve already mentioned this but I’m very excited for the new center.
1:11:31
It’s a wonderful time to be at OSU and it’s a wonderful time to be working
1:11:37
at the center and I just, you know, I just feel like I need to, I really
1:11:42
do need to name and honor the work that all these other students have
1:11:46
done in making it possible for us to even be talking about this new center.
1:11:51
So I’m really excited and really honored to be able to work there and I hope
1:11:58
that everything goes smoothly with it.
1:12:00
And just in general I hope that for next year, you know, I hope that with all
1:12:05
the changes, and with everything that we as an API community have gone though
1:12:09
over the past year, you know, I hope that we can emerge from it stronger.
1:12:12
Yeah.
1:12:13
Wonderful.
1:12:14
Thank you.
1:12:15
Thank you.
