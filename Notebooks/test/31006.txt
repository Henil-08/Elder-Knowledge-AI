00:01
My name is Natalia Fernández, I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian,
00:05
a staff member with OSU Special Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:10
Today’s date is June 3rd, 2013, and I am interviewing Tyler Hogan, a
00:16
staff member of the Native American Longhouse at Oregon State University.
00:21
So we’ll begin with some basic interview questions.
00:23
If you could state your name and spell it out loud.
00:26
My name is Tyler Hogan.
00:28
T-Y-L-E-R H-O-G-A-N.
00:32
And what is your hometown or where do you consider home?
00:35
I consider my hometown to be Junction City, Oregon.
00:38
And what is your age, year in school, and major?
00:41
I’m 23 years old, I’m a senior, and I’m majoring in political
00:44
science, with a pre-law option.
00:46
And are you affiliated with a particular tribe or tribes?
00:49
I’m enrolled with the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.
00:52
This next set of questions will be about your work at the NAL.
00:58
What is your position at the Longhouse, what do you do, and how
01:01
many years have you worked there?
01:03
I’m currently the External Coordinator of the Native American Longhouse.
01:06
That means that I oversee all of the events, all of the activities,
01:09
all of the community outreach, and all of the cultural outreach to
01:14
the tribes within the Longhouse.
01:17
I’ve been doing it for the past two years.
01:18
I also supervise the activities coordinators and the publication
01:22
coordinator, and the community outreach coordinator.
01:26
Have you worked for any of the other cultural centers?
01:29
I have not.
01:29
The Longhouse is my first one.
01:31
So why did you decide to work for the Longhouse?
01:34
I was actually working in ASOSU for a few years directing government relations,
01:39
and then I was working for Oregon State’s government relations office under
01:43
Jacques Mills [spelling?] when I was approached by Victoria Nguyen and she
01:50
mentioned that they needed an external coordinator to handle all of their
01:54
events in the cultural and community outreach here within the Longhouse.
01:57
I had kind of a surprise interview.
01:57
I thought I was
02:02
just meeting the new GTAs because I volunteered at the Longhouse for a while,
02:06
and also that same year sat on the Board of Directors for the United States Student
02:10
Association as the Chair of the First Peoples Caucus on the Board of Directors.
02:16
She knew about that about that and the work I had done with USSA as well as
02:19
sitting on the Board of Directors for OSA at the time, and reached out to me.
02:24
My lunch turned into a surprise interview and then next thing I know, I was here.
02:29
So you volunteered for the Longhouse during your sophomore year?
02:34
Yeah, my freshman and sophomore year I volunteered here.
02:38
I came here actually pretty much immediately.
02:40
The first thing I sought out.
02:43
I was only planning on being here for a year, so I was kind of looking for things
02:47
to do in that year I was going to be here.
02:50
The first thing I sought out was the federal and state
02:52
relations program in ASOSU.
02:54
I knew I wanted to major in political science and I had an
02:56
interest in government and politics, so I was online looking at that.
02:59
Then I drove up here because the small town I’m from is just thirty minutes away.
03:05
So I drove up and was touring the campus, found the Longhouse, had read
03:09
something about the Longhouse online, but couldn’t really find it because it
03:11
was in this tiny little Quonset Hut.
03:13
Eventually I stumbled in, where I believe I met Matt [spelling?] , who
03:18
is now an alumni of this center and has been our MC for the past couple
03:21
of years for our annual salmon bake.
03:23
Just starting volunteering and hanging out from there.
03:25
I did most of my homework in there.
03:26
I met a lot of great people.
03:28
Unfortunately I didn’t apply, because at that time I had already
03:31
been working ASOSU, working on legislative and vote issues.
03:38
And when you were a volunteer did you just help out as needed?
03:41
Did you do any special projects?
03:42
I helped out mostly just with events when they needed people to be there,
03:47
helped out with the camas dig each year.
03:50
Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make the Salmon Bake the first couple of
03:52
years because I was in D.C. leading the
03:57
ASOSU lobby trip.
03:57
But I also worked on a few small projects creating displays and things for the
04:05
center with some of the staff members, worked on a Cherokee language program
04:08
that we tried with one of the staff members for a little while because my
04:12
grandmother, and kind of my grandfather as well, is one of those people that can
04:15
still kind of speak our native language.
04:17
I was hoping to learn pieces from them, but also hoping to do my own
04:21
research and try and learn a little bit of my own language while I was here.
04:25
Great.
04:26
So in terms of when you began your position as External Coordinator,
04:31
were your hopes expectations for your work matched, surpassed, not matched?
04:37
I don’t know if they were matched, surpassed, or not matched.
04:41
It was different than what I had expected, that was for sure.
04:45
Coming from a government relations background and a large student
04:51
organizations background, I wasn’t really sure what the dynamics of
04:56
the center and the staff would look like, how center functions ran,
05:01
because I had never actually worked here, I had only volunteered here.
05:04
And then when you’re kind of thrown into a leadership position as one of
05:07
the external or internal coordinators here, it’s kind of sink or swim.
05:11
So the first few weeks was just basically trying to gather my bearings
05:15
and figure out what is going to be the most successful, positive way I
05:19
can handle or manage this situation.
05:25
So I don’t think that my expectations – it wasn’t that they weren’t met – it
05:28
was just that they were different.
05:31
But it was a really great opportunity and a fun learning experience.
05:35
I think that I grew a lot, particularly as a student leader and as a
05:39
supervisor, learning how to supervise in different ways, learning how to
05:46
co-facilitate in different ways.
05:49
So you have a lot of years that you could draw from.
05:52
Can you describe the projects, events, activities that were
05:56
especially meaningful to you?
05:58
And this could be either from your two years as external coordinator
06:02
or even your volunteer time.
06:05
Anything come to mind?
06:05
Yeah, definitely.
06:07
I would say that the biggest one is the Salmon Bake.
06:10
Obviously, it’s the biggest event that the Longhouse puts on each year.
06:13
But also the importance of the event, and what it really means for not only the
06:16
campus community, but all of the tribes that we work with throughout the year.
06:20
One of the things that I really wanted to do my first year was make
06:24
sure that we had strong outreach to the tribes and they knew
06:27
that if they had students within their tribes that are interested in Oregon
06:31
State at all, that we’re a resource for them, they have someone they can talk
06:34
to, they know our phone number, they know our Facebook page, things like that.
06:40
So building those relationships was really cool, and that led into the Salmon Bake.
06:43
When you go and I wrote up donation request letters similar to when I
06:49
had written grant funding for asking for salmon donations so that we could
06:54
actually put on our Salmon bake.
06:55
It was a really cool opportunity because I had already met with
06:57
a lot of the tribal leaders.
07:00
It was just really cool to see
07:06
the exchange that takes place when it’s a group of people that really,
07:10
really care about the organization and the work we are doing here.
07:13
And that was something that really just stuck out to me: when you saw how much
07:18
some of these tribal leaders – who maybe some of them had never even been to the
07:22
Oregon State campus before – but just the fact that someone would reach out
07:25
and talk to them and say, “Hey look, if you’ve got a student that would like to
07:27
come here, we are a resource for you.” That meant so much that when it came
07:30
time for salmon donations this year and last year, they were really willing.
07:35
But also if they weren’t able to donate, like last year was a really difficult
07:39
year for a lot of the tribes as far as how well the fishing season went and
07:45
just climbing out of the recession, it wasn’t as easy for certain tribes
07:48
to give or donate for the Salmon bake.
07:51
But just their willingness to say, “Hey, anything else we can help you out with,
07:54
let us know. If you need people, we can send people up there or down there
07:57
or whatever.” They just really wanted to be involved, and that was cool.
08:03
I don’t think that you can really get that type of experience, particularly
08:06
with the tribe, anywhere else.
08:08
Especially as an undergrad student employee, it’s a really unique
08:12
opportunity that meant a lot to me.
08:14
Especially when you’re getting to meet these middle school and high
08:17
school aged students that are like, “Hey, I really want to be a Beaver.
08:20
I’m really interested.” Kids talk about Jacoby Ellsbury and stuff like that.
08:24
You know, a famous native athlete here at Oregon State.
08:27
Then get them talking about the Longhouse, and it was just
08:30
a really wonderful experience.
08:35
Any Heritage Month events that you can think of that were meaningful to you?
08:40
I know there were a lot.
08:41
Yeah, there’s so many of them that it gets kind of difficult.
08:44
There was a code-talkers event, just because we were getting to share some
08:50
of the history of native people and how they’ve shaped our country in
08:54
ways that people often times don’t necessarily see, or don’t really remember.
08:57
There was also an event that I put on around the LGBTQIA and Two Spirit
09:05
communities within native culture.
09:08
It worked out well, because it was around the same time that a video and article in
09:16
Indian Country Today came out basically talking about the Two Spirit experience
09:22
with the native people in the Pacific Northwest, which was sponsored by the
09:25
Siletz tribe which was really cool.
09:27
So they have a tribal resource kit for people to use.
09:33
Really, it’s a huge packet, there’s a ton of resources for tribes,
09:36
for universities, for nonprofits, for families, for individuals.
09:40
Really whatever you
09:40
need, it’s this really cool, comprehensive resource packet.
09:43
We got to put on that, and collaborated with some of the other, like with
09:46
the Pride Center and with ASOSU’s Queer Affairs Task Force, in order
09:49
to bring as many people there as possible and share those resources.
09:52
But really just share those stories and voices of those native people
09:55
who have identified as Two Spirit or some who didn’t know that that was
09:59
a way that they could identify until an elder or traditional knowledge
10:02
keeper shared that with them.
10:07
Great.
10:09
So you mentioned this a little bit in terms of when you first started your
10:12
position as External coordinator, but what have been your challenges working at the
10:16
Longhouse, and how have you overcome them?
10:20
I think that when you first jump into a new position with a new organization
10:24
even if you’ve volunteered for a while, there’s always going to be challenges
10:26
to just trying to figure out the lay of the land, for lack of a better term.
10:31
But that kind of smooths over pretty quickly, and you just get to jump
10:34
straight into business, especially with Heritage Month being in November for us,
10:37
you kind of have to jump right into it.
10:40
So I don’t think that was too much of a challenge as much as it just
10:43
was a cool learning opportunity and an opportunity for growth.
10:46
I think some of the challenges though that definitely we faced here at the
10:50
NAL is kind of the intersectionality, the intersecting of various identities,
10:54
and how we come together as a staff and as people of many different
10:59
backgrounds - some of us native, some of us non-native, hardly any of us from the
11:03
same tribe - and try and share pieces or aspects of our culture to the rest
11:08
of the Corvallis community and explain to them why it’s important that why we
11:11
keep these pieces of our culture, or why it’s important that we practice these
11:14
traditions, or we respect these certain ways or customs here on our campus.
11:19
It’s difficult because we all have different traditions; we all have
11:21
different cultures, so trying to find a way to get a unified message
11:26
out of our 500 tribes is difficult.
11:30
I think the other thing is just a lack of awareness on our campus – letting
11:35
people know that we’re here, we exist, we’re doing some really cool work
11:38
engaging our community, and we’re offering cool resources for our students,
11:42
and great fun events for families and the rest of the Corvallis community.
11:46
But letting people know we’re here and we exist and we’re trying to do something
11:51
positive and make some change here.
11:55
So what do you consider your successes working at the Longhouse?
11:58
And this could be both professional or personal.
12:01
I think personally
12:05
I think I was able to chill out a little bit, which was
12:08
really good for me at the time.
12:10
I was a little too, or definitely too “Type A”.
12:14
I really needed to find a place that I could chill out a little bit, learn
12:19
some new management styles, learn some
12:22
new co-facilitation techniques, and just a way to be a better overall employee
12:28
and supervisor by calming down a little bit and not worrying quite as much.
12:36
But I think as far as professional successes we had this past year, one
12:42
of my main things that I do each year is I pretty much plan the Salmon Bake.
12:47
And so this was the biggest Salmon Bake, at least from what I’ve seen, the biggest
12:51
Salmon Bake that the NAL has ever had.
12:53
There were over 2,000 people, over 500 pounds of salmon, we had a drum
12:57
team, we had six traditional fancy dancers, so to me that meant a lot.
13:02
My little brother and my dad got to come up, so that was pretty
13:04
cool too that they got to see that.
13:05
But for me, that was a really big deal because last year, every year
13:08
you want to make that event bigger.
13:10
Last year we had around 1,000 people, and I was pretty happy with that, my goal was
13:14
1,200 this year, so hitting that 2,000 mark, I was really excited about that.
13:18
I also
13:21
brought Sam McCracken, who is the general manger of Nike N7 to campus, and had
13:24
the biggest collegiate event that Nike N7 has ever had in their ten years.
13:29
So we beat out U of O, and Duke, and some other larger
13:31
schools, so that was pretty cool.
13:35
So what have been your interactions with staff from the other cultural
13:41
centers?
13:41
The first interactions that you really have would be the very
13:43
beginning of the year with all staff training, or all staff retreat.
13:46
They’re usually always really positive.
13:49
It’s just kind of sharing our own identities and our own cultures,
13:52
and just getting to know people the way that any college student
13:55
is going to get to know someone.
13:56
But you get to do it in a way that’s really unique, because you are a
13:59
student leader, and you know what you’re doing, you know you have a purpose.
14:03
It’s not just like if you’re a college student and you just meet someone on the
14:07
sidewalk, or at a party, or out playing catch, or at the park or whatever, you
14:14
randomly bump into people.
14:15
When you meet people that have a passion for what they’re doing, and they have a
14:20
purpose, and they know that when they’re in these positions that they have a
14:24
higher standard that they are called to, and they know that when they’re working
14:27
for these centers that they have the ability and the opportunity to enact
14:32
real positive change on our campus.
14:34
It’s a really unique way to meet people and to just have a conversation with
14:37
someone, when everyone thinks that way.
14:39
You just get some really cool, wild, innovative, brilliant conversations
14:44
about, “Hey, let’s change the world. You know, let’s change our campus.
14:47
What can we do to make our centers better?
14:49
What can we do to build our communities?
14:51
What types of additional resources can we add?
14:54
What types of fun campaigns can we run together, what types of events can we
14:57
put on together?” Things like that.
15:01
Those interactions are really unique.
15:02
They’re really fun, and really cool.
15:07
So these next couple questions are about the new Longhouse.
15:11
Considering that you’ve been a part of the Longhouse for the past four
15:15
years now, were you a part of the design process for the new building?
15:21
Yes and no.
15:22
I was on the building planning committee, but the committee was going
15:25
for almost I think ten years now.
15:29
I guess off and on for ten years now.
15:31
So definitely not a part of the original planning committee, but I was able to
15:33
be a part of the more recent stuff.
15:38
The work on setting up these two office spaces in here, and some of
15:41
the equipment that we have in here.
15:43
I was able to be a part of that part of the planning committee, but not
15:46
necessarily the really cool parts where they picked the type of material
15:50
to use or the single pitch roof, some of the really cool aspects of
15:55
the Longhouse that were developed by people long before I got here.
15:59
And was that something that you volunteered or did select you?
16:03
It was a combination of both.
16:04
It’s kind of expected as an External Coordinator that that’s something
16:07
you’ll work on, just because that’s kind of in our job description.
16:12
Pretty much anything that has to do with anything external
16:15
within the center you work on.
16:18
So it was kind of just expected.
16:20
But I was also really excited to be a part of that and to be able to do
16:23
whatever I could to help the process go more smoothly, but also make
16:27
sure that we were providing student input, because students basically
16:31
pay the mortgage on the building.
16:34
So there was student input going into the actual building
16:36
during the planning process.
16:37
So you solicited student input from the current staff?
16:43
Or just external students?
16:43
From the current staff, from external students, from old staff who got on
16:47
Facebook and asked other staff like, “Hey, do you have any inputs, insight
16:51
into this?” I called people and said, “Hey, if you’re ever on campus
16:54
during these months, let us know.
16:55
We’d love to be able to hear from you about what you’d like to see.” I’d also
17:00
been a part of the building committee for the SCC before, so I have a little bit
17:02
of experience in that, so I’ve tried to take a little bit of that knowledge and
17:05
experience and bring it into the current planning process for the Longhouse.
17:12
So what does the new Longhouse mean to you?
17:17
It means so much to me.
17:20
I think the biggest thing is the opportunity that it’s going to
17:22
provide to native students on our campus and for our community here.
17:26
It’s a
17:29
beacon to the rest of campus that native students are here
17:32
and that we have a presence.
17:34
To have a building this big and beautiful, right in the middle of campus
17:39
is a pretty big statement, I think.
17:42
It’s a statement that kind of shows the commitment that the
17:44
university has made to acknowledging
17:51
their respect for native students on campus and the native community here.
17:55
And especially those students who spent thirty-five years in a temporary building,
18:02
and how long they’ve fought, and how hard they’ve fought to get into this place.
18:04
How many tears and sleepless nights, and long work weeks went into
18:10
just trying to get this place built - it’s in their honor, but also for all of
18:16
those other students on the reservations and off the reservation, like the urban
18:20
Indian population that’s looking for a place to go, that want to find a strong
18:23
community at home so they don’t feel lost or alone when they get to campus,
18:27
they can now come to campus and see this.
18:29
This is one of the first things you see.
18:31
I think that’s a really cool opportunity, and that means a lot because it
18:34
means that we hopefully can grow, or
18:38
increase the amount of native students that we recruit to our
18:40
campus, but also make sure that they know that they have a home, and they
18:43
have a place when they are here.
18:47
The next set of questions is all about ideas for the future and the
18:51
bigger picture of the Longhouse.
18:53
So what events, projects, activities, would you have liked to have seen or
18:58
would you recommend for the future?
19:00
The biggest thing I can say is we need to have more personal,
19:04
physical outreach to the tribes.
19:07
Stuff on the phone and e-mail is great, but the times that I was fortunate enough
19:12
to actually go to the reservations, mostly it was for salmon donation pickups,
19:19
getting to meet with people, and talk about the work that we’re doing,
19:22
and look at pictures from old salmon bakes that someone would bring out
19:25
saying, “Hey, we donated this time. This is a funny picture we have.”
19:28
Things like that are really cool.
19:30
But also, every time you go, someone brings a young student out there
19:35
just to meet with you and they say, “Hey, this guy goes to Oregon State.
19:37
I want you to meet my son, or my nephew, or my nice, or my granddaughter, or
19:41
whatever it is.” There’s always someone, and it just makes you realize the
19:46
potential for young native people if they can just realize that they have a home
19:50
and the have a place, and I think that’s just kind of our responsibility now with
19:55
this new, beautiful, awesome building.
19:59
I hate using the cliché Spiderman reference, but “with great power, come
20:04
great responsibility.” It’s like, with this great awesome building, we have an
20:08
added responsibility to ourselves and to our community now, especially as native
20:12
leaders because there’s so few of us here on campus. We owe it to ourselves and our
20:16
community to do whatever we can to get to the reservations to build effective
20:20
outreach tools, to make sure that we’re creating different types of workshops.
20:24
Whatever types of resources possible to let native students know that they
20:30
have a place and home, and that they can succeed here, that we can help
20:33
provide them the resources for them to be successful in their academic
20:36
careers, that they have the potential for professional development and leadership
20:40
growth by working at the Longhouse.
20:42
I think that with all of the positions that they offer here, there is a
20:47
phenomenal opportunity for professional development and leadership growth
20:50
that you probably can’t get in a lot of other places and a lot of
20:52
other student positions on campus.
20:54
So letting them know that they have these opportunities is our responsibility.
20:59
I think that we’ve started to incorporate that during this budgeting
21:02
year to make sure that we can cover travel costs to get people to the
21:07
reservations so that we can actually start performing some of that outreach.
21:12
Great.
21:13
So what advice would you give future Longhouse staff?
21:17
Or potentially OSU cultural staff in general?
21:22
Well, if you’re the External coordinator and you’re listening
21:24
to this or reading this: delegate.
21:27
Because sometimes you forget to delegate or you think, “Oh, it will be faster if
21:31
I do it myself” and next thing you know you’re kind of turning into a crazy person
21:35
in trying to do way too much and it’s just not fair to the people around you
21:39
and it’s just not good, it’s not healthy. You need to find a better way to delegate
21:44
and that’s always been the problem, one of the issues I guess with the
21:50
external/internal coordinators at least.
21:51
That’s what I’ve been told from past external coordinators and
21:54
from Victoria and things like that.
21:56
Finding ways to delegate but also just get out.
22:02
Don’t just stay in the center, don’t just be here as someone who is going to welcome
22:06
people as they come into our building, make sure that you are doing something.
22:09
Like our purpose is so much greater than just being up here to greet people, that
22:14
is important as well and making sure that were friendly and inviting and they
22:18
know that if people want to come in here and gain resources and gain knowledge
22:22
and cultural understanding, that we are there for that but also there is
22:25
the other side, we can’t just do that.
22:27
We have to make sure that we are getting out, like I said to meet with
22:30
other departments on campus, with other native organizations throughout
22:35
the areas, with other tribes.
22:37
Whatever it is, just make sure that we branch out as much
22:40
as possible because we got to
22:43
do it bigger.
22:44
There are so few of us on campus, the only way we are going to
22:47
change that is by reaching out more and trying a little harder.
22:51
Great.
22:53
So based on working at the Longhouse, what is a take away or several takeaways
22:58
if you have more, that you’ve gained that you would like to share with others?
23:06
I think the thing that always strikes me the most is how resilient and how
23:14
passionate and empowered native people are and can be, especially when given
23:18
an opportunity that you see so many people, so many young native people that
23:27
without the right opportunity or without an opportunity or understanding there’s
23:31
an opportunity there, they waste some of their power and their energy and
23:38
their ability to do awesome things.
23:44
But being in a place where we are trying to provide those resources and provide
23:48
those opportunities to native students, know students here on campus and potential
23:53
students, seeing the change that can happen in people and the growth that can
23:58
happen over such a short amount of time when you just share the opportunities
24:02
that we have for native people.
24:04
It’s so unbelievable to see, it’s one of those things that’s like… those
24:09
are the type of things that keep you advocating and fighting for your
24:12
community for the rest of your life.
24:14
Those are the types of little, small
24:15
victories that when you see the change in somebody and when you see the light in
24:19
someone’s eyes when they feel like “I’m going to make it, I have you know whatever
24:24
it is,” that’s the kind of stuff that’s just like… it keeps you going you know?
24:28
It’s like it gets super stressful working in a position like this, especially as
24:33
an undergrad student, trying to find a way to balance school and work and your
24:37
personal life and everything else but those little things are the things that
24:41
really make it worthwhile, especially when you get to work with other groups.
24:44
Like we bring high school and middle school groups here and like seeing those
24:49
kids, it’s like that is one of the best things you can possibly ever take away.
24:54
And for anyone who ever listens to this or reads this, whatever they do,
24:57
do whatever you can to reach out to young people because when you show
25:01
them that they… just show them the opportunity and show them there is
25:04
some kind of hope, its life changing.
25:09
So this could be the next question your answer could be already answered.
25:15
What is the biggest issue in terms of the purpose of the
25:19
Longhouse and why it’s important?
25:21
So I think that the Longhouse serves, in my mind I kind of
25:25
think of three distinct functions.
25:27
The first one as a resource for OSU students, the OSU community,
25:31
Corvallis community, for us to share our culture and our knowledge and our
25:34
identities with people, to hopefully build a more culturally competent
25:38
campus and more inclusive campus.
25:42
And then there is also providing the space and the ability to
25:45
have, you know medium to large scale events and things like that.
25:49
To have community gatherings; to have conferences and dinners and
25:54
ceremonies or whatever it is.
25:57
Being able to do those two things but then, kind of like I’ve been
26:00
harping on I guess probably because I’m the external coordinator so it’s
26:03
what I’ve been working on so to me it’s a little more near and dear is
26:08
the community outreach and cultural outreach aspect.
26:11
Making sure we are really working with native people outside of our campus and
26:17
bringing native people into our campus, whether it’s bringing in a guest speaker,
26:21
partnering with another organization like Nike N7 or with the Native American
26:26
Youth and Family Association in Portland.
26:29
Partnering with those organizations or just getting to a reservation
26:32
and talking to some young people.
26:35
To me that’s where I think we could see the most growth in the NAL and I think
26:39
that’s the biggest opportunity that the NAL and this University has to utilize
26:44
these resources and these passionate, young, native student leaders to increase
26:50
recruitment and potentially retention rates for new students on our campus.
26:56
And how would you describe the impact of the Longhouse on native
27:04
students?
27:04
I would say, we always say were a home away from home but we really are.
27:08
You start to develop a family after you’ve been here long
27:10
enough, these people become such
27:12
close friends that when you don’t see them for a day you’re like
27:14
“oh wait, where is so and so?
27:15
Why are they not here right now and I know they don’t have class right,
27:18
there supposed to be in here” and so it’s really cool building that sense of
27:22
community, especially because most of our communities are relatively small,
27:27
often times it’s just, you know, a family, an extended family or whatever.
27:31
And you get to build that while you are here on campus, only you do it
27:34
with the friends that will become your kind of native OSU family.
27:39
I think that’s pretty cool.
27:41
And how would you describe the impact of the NAL on the OSU and local community?
27:47
I think that the work we do with the Salmon Bake has really kind of shown
27:53
to me the impact that we have with the amount of… one the amount of news coverage
27:58
that the OSU community or Corvallis community loves to do on things like
28:02
that, but just the amount of people that show up with a genuine interest.
28:06
Like a lot of people you know are going to show up because “hey, it’s
28:08
free salmon, that’s awesome” but so many people show up just asking
28:11
questions and wanting to know more.
28:13
I mean literally hundreds of people just coming saying “hey who do I
28:17
talk to? What events do you have going on? Where can I find out more?”
28:20
like “Do you have a Facebook page?
28:22
Hey can we tour your building?” So many people just get so
28:25
interested whenever they see
28:30
the salmon pit or whenever they hear a drum team, whenever they see dancers and
28:34
things like that, that I think that we are having a really positive impact on the
28:40
OSU community, on kind of the culture of OSU in making it basically more inclusive
28:46
and culturally competent and just aware that native people are here and that we
28:50
still hold on to our traditions, even if it’s not every day, like the Salmon
28:57
Bake or Pow wow or whatever it is.
29:00
You know I think when I started here not a lot of people, not a lot of
29:03
people I knew at least, even knew the Longhouse existed, knew that we had a
29:06
Salmon Bake, knew that OSU had Pow wow.
29:09
And now everyone I know and people I’m always talking to or running into are
29:13
finding out about that and I’ve had people talk to me like “hey you’re native right?
29:17
Have you heard about this?” and I was like “yes I have, I helped put that
29:20
on this year but I’m so glad you know about it, like it’s really cool.” So
29:24
seeing that happen just in the few years that I’ve been here has been
29:29
really cool and hopefully that trend will continue forever here on campus.
29:37
Can you describe your thoughts on why sharing your story is
29:41
important to your identity if it is?
29:43
Yeah, I think it’s important.
29:46
One, for me, just like externally processing some of the things that you
29:50
do and go through here in the Longhouse because we really, sometimes it’s hard
29:55
to say like “what are your day to day activities?” and you try to tell someone,
29:58
like walk them through. It’s really hard to kind of go through all those things
30:02
sometimes because often we are doing so much and so many things all at once.
30:07
You really… it can be quite overwhelming so being able to sit down and tell your
30:12
story, it kind of just externalize some of that information, is really important
30:18
because you start to realize just as you’re saying it “oh yeah I did, I did
30:21
that, yeah that was so cool to see that” or you remember certain things and faces
30:25
and different things that just come up.
30:28
You’re like “oh this is really cool, this is part of who I am and I am really
30:33
proud to have done this.” And I think that every time someone asks me about
30:37
the Longhouse and work that I’ve done here, I always am a little more proud
30:42
to have been able to call the Longhouse my home because I just think about it
30:46
more and more and as I tell that story to more people and they start learning
30:50
about and they share it with their friends and then they want to come in here and
30:52
find out what’s going on or they let a native student know and they come in and
30:55
next thing you know it’s there home and their working here and things like that.
30:59
And that it’s a really cool way to kind of reflect on the kind of things that
31:04
you’ve done and worked on but at the same time build aspects of your own
31:08
identity and just through externally processing everything that you do here.
31:15
I think that
31:18
we perhaps focus… maybe we don’t focus enough on personal identity development
31:25
here and I think sometimes we assume that we you come to the University
31:26
that we already, especially if we are
31:32
the types of students that want to be in student leadership positions or want to
31:35
work at the Longhouse that we already kind of have our identity locked so to speak,
31:39
which is not going to be true for anybody but I think that’s why telling our story
31:44
is so important because when we are not focusing… if we don’t focus enough on our
31:48
own identity development personally or as a team or whatever we are doing, the only
31:52
way we develop that is through the work we do in the Longhouse and through the
31:55
events that we put on and the interactions with other people, the conversations with
31:58
native and non-native people on campus.
32:00
And then when you get to tell that story like they get to help
32:03
you kind of shape your identity a little better and helps you kind
32:07
of build that path a little better.
32:10
Great.
32:12
So this last question is about the general atmosphere on campus
32:17
in terms of race relations.
32:19
Can you describe your experiences at OSU pertaining to racial or ethnic identity
32:25
or specifically your tribal affiliation?
32:27
Yeah.
32:30
So, there has been positive and negative things, I think
32:39
a lot of the negative things typically come from people who just don’t really
32:42
understand, people who are just generally ignorant to whatever we are working on
32:49
or straight like bigoted and they’ll say things like “oh you shouldn’t
32:53
have a Longhouse on campus, all those Indians, all they do is like drink.”
33:01
They just come with all sorts crazy stuff.
33:02
I’ve seen people post things on Facebook, on the Longhouse Facebook page, on my
33:07
personal Facebook page, people say things to me about other people working here
33:12
and “oh what can you possibly do there?” Like people that just don’t understand,
33:16
they just perpetuate these stereotypes about native people that they kind of
33:19
see from you know the families that have been passed around are like these really
33:23
terrible Hollywood portrayals of native people in our communities and so you
33:29
get a lot more than you would expect. And it’s pretty crappy, it’s not a fun
33:36
thing deal with especially when some of these people are like talking about or
33:40
referring to it are people that you’ve come to know and love and respect. But
33:45
I think that’s one of the things any native person is going to deal with.
33:48
There is also the positive things though within I think our University
33:55
Leadership does a good job, Alison Davis White Eyes does a great job, and
33:58
President Ray and Dr. Roper have done a really good job of acknowledging the
34:02
important work that native students are doing but also how kind of unique our
34:06
experience is because we are such a small minority population here on campus and
34:10
because the land that this University is on is originally native land.
34:13
And so they do a good job of addressing that and recognizing that and showing
34:17
support for our community on campus.
34:20
Also since the increase with the Nike N7 basketball game,
34:23
that’s a really big thing.
34:25
People have become a lot more excited about just the idea of native culture.
34:32
Who knows what that means to them but they just think it’s really cool and they can
34:34
see a native pattern on a turquoise Nike T-shirt and they come in here and ask us
34:38
about it and we get to kind of tell them the story and especially having one of
34:41
the only native basketball players here has been really cool for kind of the
34:50
experience of a native person on this campus and kind of the sense
34:56
of belonging and the sense of like cultural competency as far as people
35:00
understanding of like native culture.
35:06
Well is there anything that we have not discussed that you would like
35:09
to add or anything that talked about that you would like to go back to
35:14
and talk a little bit more about?
35:16
I don’t think so.
35:18
I just hope that if someone you know that’s an external coordinator in the
35:24
future or a community outreach coordinator who knows what positions will be called
35:27
or look like in the future, they could all be different but if anyone ever has the
35:30
opportunity to do any outreach to young native people in the future, I hope that
35:34
they, if they hear this and listen to it, that they’ll go and do it because we have
35:38
an unbelievable potential at the Longhouse right now, especially with how much energy
35:42
we’re building around this new building.
35:47
We have to really capitalize on it and we owe it to our communities to
35:50
do the best we can in the next few years to just get after it really and
35:54
to recruit as many native people as possible and to build the most inclusive,
35:59
amazing spot for people on campus to learn and share about native culture.
36:06
Great, well thank you very much.
36:07
Thank you.
