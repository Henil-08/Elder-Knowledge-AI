00:03
My name is Natalia Fernández.
00:05
Today’s date is February 23, 2015, and we are conducting an oral history interview
00:11
as part of the Asian Family Center Oral History Project with board members.
00:18
So, if you could please state your name, and spell it out loud.
00:21
Um, my name is Connie Kim Yen Nguyen-Truong.
00:25
It’s C-O-N-N-I-E, K-I-M, Y-E-N, N-G-U-Y-E-N, hyphen, T-R-U-O-N-G.
00:43
Perfect.
00:44
And, what is your birthdate and your birthplace?
00:47
Um, I was born May 26th, 1976 and, actually, here in Portland, Oregon.
00:54
And with which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
00:58
Um, Vietnamese-American.
01:01
And, when and where were your parents born?
01:04
My parents were both born in Vietnam.
01:06
And my mother, in particular, in the northern part of Vietnam and my father
01:12
in the southern part of Vietnam.
01:15
And when did they immigrant over to the United States?
01:18
It was during the fall of the Vietnam Wars, and that I want to say in 1975.
01:27
So you were born here in Portland, and this is where you grew up?
01:31
Yes, and so, part—I did have, like, a few years in Vancouver, but that
01:37
was literally across the bridge.
01:40
And so, I’ve been informed that that’s still very neighboring to Portland.
01:44
But, yes, my upbringing here is in Portland, Oregon, and
01:47
I’ve lived in various parts of Oregon around, like, north
01:57
Portland to southeast Portland to now southwest Portland.
02:01
And where did you go to school?
02:03
Um, do you mean, like, high school or?
02:04
Sure, high school.
02:06
I started out at Benson High School, and they had their health occupations
02:10
programs and that was something that I was very interested in.
02:15
And, I was also interested in vocational and was thinking at that
02:21
time, will I be an engineer like my father or will I go into health care?
02:28
And then, from there, I went to Linfield College, the Samaritan School of
02:34
Nursing, and graduated in 2000 with my baccalaureate of science and nursing.
02:40
And then, practiced for five years, and then I went to and got admitted
02:46
into the doctor of philosophy nursing program in the post baccalaureate,
02:50
PhD in nursing up at Oregon Health and Science University, school of nursing.
02:57
And then, I defended my dissertation in March of 2011, and then in June of
03:04
2011, I had, in terms of, like, sorry, pursued, my postdoctoral fellowship.
03:19
And so, I did that through 2013--trying to remember my own course.
03:26
Wonderful.
03:27
And what was the focus of your dissertation?
03:30
Um, it was particularly in terms of pap-testing practices among
03:34
Vietnamese immigrant women living in the United States and using an
03:38
ecological and collaborative approach.
03:41
Wonderful.
03:41
And so, your research was here in Portland for that?
03:44
Yes.
03:45
Yes, and then, with that, it was really where I got to work really closely with
03:50
IRCO Asian Family Center on the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project that they had.
03:57
And so, from there, I was trying to think of, like, what is it that I
04:02
can do to continue to build on the Vietnamese women’s health Project.
04:07
And so, that’s where the idea and the priority around cervical cancer
04:13
screening among Vietnamese-American and immigrant women came to be.
04:18
So that’s interesting that you bring up IRCO and the Asian Family Center.
04:22
Did they contact you or did you learn about their projects and contact them?
04:28
How did that relationship begin?
04:30
Um, it’s really interesting.
04:32
It was actually, I was—before I even knew about IRCO Asian Family Center,
04:38
I heard in general that there were community organizations that were
04:43
focused in terms of helping the underserved and communities of color.
04:49
And then, I was wondering if there would be any organization that was
04:55
focused on Asian and Pacific Islander and then, in particular, Vietnamese.
05:00
And so, when I had those conversations with Dr. Frances Lee-Lin, who later on
05:07
became one of my dissertation community members, she had informed me of that,
05:12
and has said, “You know, have you heard of IRCO Asian Family Center?” I
05:18
was like, “You know, I don’t believe I have, formally.” And so, then I had
05:26
called to inquire to see if I could
05:33
learn about IRCO AFC,
05:38
and then letting them know what my interest was.
05:41
And then they said that, “Okay, well we’ll keep you in mind.
05:44
And that was Danita Huynh.
05:47
And she’s, she’s so kind.
05:49
And so, that really stayed with me in terms of just that short few minutes
05:54
of interaction, how welcoming she was.
05:57
And, shortly thereafter, they really contacted me.
06:01
And then that’s how I learned about the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project
06:05
and how they were seeing that this was something that I was interested in and
06:11
was wondering if I would be interested in learning more about the positions
06:16
that was going to be within that project.
06:18
So, I was like, woah, I was, like, hoping to learn about IRCO AFC, and
06:23
then here’s a project that is really, like, directly in line with what I’m
06:28
thinking about in general--something about the Vietnamese community.
06:33
And so, I learned more about the research project that was funded
06:37
through the National Cancer Institute of the National Institute of Health.
06:42
And then, with that, at that time, it was Dr. Amy Copus [sp?] , was
06:49
the principle investigator, and then later on it was Dr. Jessica Grey.
06:53
So, there was a transition in the PI, so that was interesting in terms
07:00
of, like, seeing how even just the varied leadership within that project.
07:07
So, that’s how I learned, initially.
07:10
Wonderful.
07:11
So, can you talk a little bit more about the Vietnamese health project?
07:16
It was specific to women or it was the Vietnamese community in general?
07:21
Uh, specific to women.
07:24
But, they did have, like, different phases.
07:25
So, the first phase was really looking at developing a semi-structured interview
07:32
guide and really making sure that there were key informers consisting
07:39
of men and women across different age spectrum and different experiences.
07:45
And so that, I thought, was really informative.
07:49
And, even the community advisory board for the research project was diverse
07:54
too—it was consisting of different experiences, whether, like, medical
08:02
physician or a nurse supervisor from Multnomah County Health Department, and
08:09
we also had a social worker who worked at the Intercultural Psychiatry Clinic.
08:16
So, it was really diverse.
08:18
And, we had community members, so that way the interview guide would be able
08:26
to be language sensitive and appropriate and also culturally appropriate.
08:31
So, that was a patient process; it takes time to do that phase, but it was so
08:36
important to have that engagement piece.
08:39
So, were you a part of the project, when it was in the very beginning stages
08:44
or had it already, pretty much, begun when you were invited to participate?
08:49
Oh it was actually in the beginning.
08:50
And it was because it was a community-based participatory research.
08:54
And so, the way that even how they worked and did the proposal--even though I
09:00
wasn’t a part of the proposal process, but seeing that it was based on a community
09:06
needs assessment of the tri-county area.
09:09
So, there was collaboration with IRCO, with Providence, and also
09:17
PSU, Portland State University.
09:20
And, Providence, what I mean is the Providence Medical—Providence
09:25
Portland Medical Center.
09:27
And so, there was already a collaboration to even do the community needs assessment,
09:33
which identified the need for the cervical, assessing cervical cancer
09:39
screening and beliefs around practices around screening and even how around,
09:47
beliefs around cervical cancer itself.
09:50
And then, from there, based on that needs assessment data, there was engagement
09:56
that, ‘cuz it’s ongoing--and that’s the great thing about IRCO Asian Family Center
10:01
‘cuz I’ve not only been a health educator and research assistant on the project,
10:08
but knowing that there was already, like, continuing engagement, and it’s ongoing.
10:15
Even after the research funding project ended, it was still continuing, and
10:20
that’s that commitment that IRCO AFC has, is that open door policy and
10:27
always looking for ways to engage.
10:30
So, it’s really great.
10:32
I was like, “Wow, this is such a smooth transition.” It’s like, I got to learn
10:36
about this community needs assessment, and here I am getting to be in this piece,
10:41
and it’s still an ongoing engagement cuz the research project itself was making
10:46
sure that it continued to have community member participation, and so, very
10:53
thoughtful and strategic in that way.
10:57
Can you share a little bit about why community-based participatory
11:04
projects are so important compared to projects that aren’t done that way?
11:10
What are some of the benefits and what do you feel is, are some of the
11:16
main reasons why it’s so important to work on projects that way,
11:20
especially with topics such as health?
11:22
Yes.
11:23
And, thank you for that question because that, that’s something
11:26
we’re just so passionate, that I’m really passionate about.
11:29
And so, that ties into really, I, where it becomes where--it’s
11:38
where, with organizations like IRCO AFC doesn’t assume that because we
11:40
are a community organization that we know what the community wants.
11:44
It’s where we’re going to go and outreach, including hard to reach
11:50
places, and so, that way, when it’s more around community-based participatory,
11:56
it’s what is it that the community members, what are they seeing that
12:00
is important, that’s a priority.
12:03
Because there may be, like, several different things, but they’re maybe, like,
12:06
“We really need to focus on this.” And so, there’s that, there’s that part that’s
12:13
the identification of the need. And then, here it’s like IRCO AFC can see where they
12:19
can be like a vehicle for that to help.
12:24
And the other formality piece, because with research funding and applying
12:28
for that, it’s a very rigorous process, but making sure that there’s
12:35
the voice of the community members.
12:36
So, it’s not where we think because it’s important and this is what research says.
12:41
It’s like, well this is what the research is saying, but we are definitely hearing
12:46
that this is a need that the community members and the leaders are talking about.
12:51
And so, that’s what helps to drive.
12:54
And so, that empowerment piece is really important.
12:59
That’s one of the principles in community-based participatory research.
13:02
How is it where community members can feel that they have control in their
13:07
lives and in what they do by being a part of the project, by being, how
13:13
their voices is being heard, and how it’s being, in terms of, like, used to
13:20
facilitate that next step or next project.
13:24
And, Minkler and Wallerstein who are, we like to call them the research
13:30
expert gurus in community-based participatory research, and that they
13:34
even have, like, their addition book on CBPR, good thing for the acronym.
13:41
And so, that was something that they talk about, is that the priority problem, the
13:48
need, is identified by the people that are affected by it, so the community itself.
13:57
And, that it’s community-based versus community-placed.
14:00
So, that’s something that the Minkler and Wallerstein asserts.
14:05
And then, having it where they become active participants in trying to,
14:10
like, identify and see what’s going on with this, so that way—because
14:15
we want to have sustainability, and that’s really important.
14:18
And, that’s something that I see IRCO AFC, like, anything that they’re able
14:22
to do and they make sure is having that commitment and that ongoing engagement
14:33
with the community versus, oh we did this and that was the one time, and that’s it.
14:38
It’s, well we’re doing this, and how can we continue to improve, and what can
14:44
we do so that we, this can continue on?
14:48
Especially, what if the funding ends, how can it continue on and sustain?
14:53
And that’s, that’s how—that’s the question we continue to think about.
14:58
What do we do sustainability wise?
15:03
Well, in doing a project like this, you mentioned interview guides, you mentioned
15:10
a community advisory board, so how, how does an organization and individuals,
15:16
like yourself, how do you start to build that trust with the community?
15:20
How do you, how do you build those relationships in order to,
15:25
then, work with the community?
15:26
So there was, you mentioned there was a needs assessment, so there was
15:29
already some community collaboration and participation there, but, can you
15:33
talk a little bit about that process?
15:35
Yes.
15:36
And trust, trust is very important and huge.
15:41
And, again, it’s, like, ongoing.
15:43
And so, even with the community needs assessment, there was something,
15:47
like, that was written as, like, lessons learned after that.
15:53
And, one of that was which really thinking about the leaders, like the gatekeepers.
16:01
So that way, can help to, like, if there’s the community leaders and gatekeepers
16:09
of, maybe it’s of a congregation, maybe it’s—whether it’s a Catholic church
16:15
or maybe it’s at a Buddhist temple.
16:18
And the reason why I bring that up is because it’s, like, having that, like,
16:23
endorsement from the community leaders who are saying, this is, this is someone or an
16:30
organization that wants to do this because of this, and I am in support of that.
16:40
And that’s something that we found was really important.
16:43
So, the community advisory board for the Vietnamese women’s health project,
16:48
it was really helpful because they were also helping to refer participants.
16:53
And, we’re wanting to be sensitive, you know, like, if
16:57
they don’t want to, they say no.
16:59
And, the potential participants don’t want to participate in the project or
17:03
the study, they have, they need to know they have the right to say no, but making
17:08
sure that they have an informed decision.
17:11
And so, that’s that part where we are, we’re, for example, like, finding ways.
17:17
And, seeing even how we wrote up the invitation script and then that gets
17:24
reviewed by the Internal Review Board, the IRB, to make sure that everything that’s
17:31
being said in there was being truthful in terms of, like, there’s unanticipated
17:36
benefits to participate in this,
17:38
but
17:42
if you participate in this, it may have these kind of benefits.
17:49
And so, what I’m trying to get to is that those conversations that we have
17:56
with the community leaders and community member representatives from different
18:00
community organizations helps to give that insight of how to show that we
18:07
really, sincerely care, and that we’re not just going to come in there and do
18:13
this project and then leave and that’s it.
18:15
It’s, it’s what are we gonna make of the findings once we know
18:20
about it and once we learn about it and then what’s the next step?
18:25
And so, that’s that part of the ongoing commitment-wise
18:28
and the leaders and members.
18:30
I have found when I work with them, they said, “You know, it makes
18:35
sense why we haven’t heard from you, because this is the process that
18:39
seems to be where now you’re getting to share, maybe at a conference.
18:44
And so, this is maybe the dissemination sharing out to the scientific community.
18:50
So, are you going to do something like this here where the community members get
18:55
to learn?” And so, then, we continue that conversation with the leaders in terms of,
19:00
like, what’s the best way to share back what we learned from the study findings?
19:07
And, because we continue to have those conversations and thinking of how we have
19:12
those conversations with the leaders and members, they continue to further support
19:18
and show that endorsement for the project or the program of the, of IRCO AFC.
19:25
And that’s really important, that’s been so important.
19:29
And, I feel so appreciative ‘cuz even as of today, I will have it where if the
19:36
leader member will be like, “Well, you did a project on women, so, at some point,
19:40
will there be something about men?” And so, then they’re like, like, already,
19:43
like wondering what the next step is.
19:45
And I’m like, “Oh that’s right, it’s time for me to communicate to
19:49
them about next steps.” So those are such important conversations,
19:54
and it, continues to build trust.
19:56
And we don’t want any part of that to get severed ‘cuz that’s important.
20:01
So you mentioning that you’ve been going to conferences and disseminating
20:06
information, can you share a little bit how the broader community in your
20:11
field has, has reacted to this project?
20:14
Oh, yes.
20:15
So, in terms of, like, the overall response has been quite positive.
20:21
‘Cuz that other part about the research is that it needs to be rigorous and high
20:26
quality in terms of, like, the methods and how we went about implementing the
20:33
community based participatory and how we adapted those principles and used them.
20:38
And even Minkler and Wallerstein says, you can’t just use, just,
20:43
like, literally here’s the principles, and be like, we’re just gonna
20:47
do everything the way it says.
20:49
It’s supposed to be tailored.
20:51
So because of that and how well we are making sure that it’s still maintaining
20:59
rigor that we’re working with community members versus, versus where it’s the
21:07
other around where the power gets shifted only to the PI or the other investigators.
21:13
And so the—what I have found, for example, the first time I was sharing
21:19
the study proposal and it got accept—the abstract got accepted to be presented
21:24
in a poster presentation format, and by that time, I printed out 50 hard copies
21:32
‘cuz it’s like good to give hard copies.
21:34
And almost, like, half was already, like, taken in that first couple
21:39
of hours, and I was hoping for at least five that gets taken.
21:43
So, to me, the folks who were already, like, drawn into—and they were really
21:49
intrigued ‘cuz they’re like, “Oh, what is this?” You know, “Tell me more
21:53
about how this is really feasible.
21:56
And it sounds like it was a patient process.” And so,
22:00
that part speaks volumes.
22:02
I saw to my fellow colleagues wise that how, how was it feasible?
22:09
What was the timeline, ‘cuz there’s always the timeline to do this.
22:14
And also, how true did we stay to being community based.
22:19
And, because of that, that really, I find, that even through my co-author
22:25
publications that I’m first author on, there was a lot of interest
22:30
from—and, it’s blind peer review.
22:32
That’s another level again, is want it to be rigorous.
22:36
And, they would--the reviewers actually wanted more elaboration
22:42
on the actual community based participatory research, the methods part.
22:48
And they were really intrigued about that, and how the study was still
22:53
able to be able to be rigorous and still stay within the timeline.
22:58
And, doing something to address a health disparity topic.
23:03
And so, that’s been positively received.
23:07
So, both at health conferences, deporting presentations, people say, “This is
23:13
so passionate.” Something about, what was it, logistic regression - logistic
23:18
and also regression analysis, how this sounds so exciting and so passionate.
23:22
I was like, oh good.
23:23
Statistics is good.
23:24
Wonderful.
23:26
So in talking about feasibility, do you think projects like this are doable
23:33
without organizations like IRCO AFC?
23:35
Or, it really is organizations like the AFC that enable
23:41
this type of collaboration?
23:44
For me, because of the experience that I had, it was so important to have that,
23:52
like, the support of endorsement from the organization.
23:55
Because, for the dissertation research, I had partnered with programs that were
24:01
within IRCO AFC, so I had this support overall by the AFC because it was
24:07
building on top of what was being done.
24:11
So, there was that part where they’re like, “You are committed, Connie.
24:15
We see that, and let’s see, let’s see what ways we can help.” And
24:19
so, even by providing the location venue, the conference center place,
24:26
and so, that helped to reduce the issue of travelling up to the hill
24:31
at OHSO and also finding parking.
24:35
I usually hear that from community members is the parking issue, they
24:40
said, “We’re not sure we can find parking, and we got to go up to the
24:44
hill.” And I was like, “Oh.” So that helped to reduce a barrier ‘cuz, since,
24:48
they’re more, IRCO AFC was more, out there in the neighborhood setting wise.
24:56
And then the other part was—and, Dr. Paru Wong [sp?] , she was
25:02
the project coordinator of the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project.
25:06
And so, when that project ended, and because folks were getting to know
25:10
who Dr. Wong is, and so it was really great where I was able to say that
25:18
we’re partnering, and then I’m working also with Dr. Wong for this piece here.
25:24
And she’s where I can ask her questions.
25:27
And that was, that was really great ‘cuz, I know how busy she is, and, yet, she
25:32
was making sure that we had a venue place and that I could also formally announce
25:41
who I was working with in IRCO AFC.
25:43
So, having that continued endorsement and support for the project by
25:50
those who saw the sincerity.
25:54
That’s the thing, it’s not because it was for my own, personal gain.
25:59
And that was really important to demonstrate that this isn’t because
26:03
it’s for my own personal gain, it’s for our, for our community.
26:10
So, I learned so much from those who—from staff at IRCO at AFC--even
26:17
just phrases and what I say.
26:19
And so I was so thankful for that, to have that mentoring.
26:23
And, they’re so, they’re so humble.
26:25
And I say they because there was someone else that worked there, [sp?]
26:34
. And he didn’t see himself as a mentor, and Paru—Dr.
26:39
Wong [sp?] —was like, “Oh Connie, you’re fine.” You know, like, she
26:42
would say that, and I’m like, “You’re so humble.” And I’m learning so much,
26:46
they’re mentoring me, and that’s the part that I’m so grateful for.
26:51
So it helps me to think more than twice about how I’m going to even talk with
26:59
the community leaders, the community members, what my purpose is here.
27:03
And, I hope that answers your question.
27:07
Definitely.
27:08
So, you mentioned being mindful of a timeline, from the time that
27:14
you—when was the year around the time that you began with the project?
27:18
And then, even though you mentioned sustainability and that the project sort
27:22
of ends but the relationship continues, so about how many months or years did
27:28
it take for the project as a whole?
27:31
Um, so, for me, when I first started was in fall of 2008.
27:35
And that was where the project, the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project, it was
27:43
undergoing Internal Review Board review.
27:46
And so, not actively recruiting until the IRB formally approved
27:53
the research study protocol itself.
27:57
But, in the meantime, it was where--I already got to see how they were making
28:02
sure that we could still get started on the engagement and the, the brain
28:10
thinking of how to go about implementing.
28:14
And so, that started 2008.
28:18
And then, I stayed on as a health educator research assistant through the summer.
28:27
And then, I was, and then I transitioned
28:30
as a volunteer.
28:32
And so, I was able to—they invited me to be, now, a community advisory member for
28:40
the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project.
28:41
And so, then, I stayed on through that year 2009, ‘10, ‘cuz then
28:49
they have their dissemination.
28:51
They were done in fall 2010, and then they were working on the manuscript that
28:57
I got to be a co-author on and worked on.
29:00
And so, that, that’s the, we call it the quiet phase.
29:04
It seems like, it’s like you’re on your computer a lot at that time.
29:08
And so, that was that 2000, I want to say 2010, 2011 piece.
29:15
Yeah, the quiet phase is very different, you know.
29:18
And, you mentioned you defended your PhD, your dissertation in 2012, was that?
29:23
Right, March 2011.
29:24
’11, okay.
29:26
And so, I had collected data, and I did a quantitative, descriptive
29:33
community based survey study.
29:35
Since the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project--the first one--was a
29:38
qualitative in-depth interview.
29:41
And then, so then, mine was the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project two,
29:44
the quantitative, statistical piece to it.
29:48
And that was done--that 2010 was when
29:55
I was really focused on the data collection piece.
30:00
And was there a part three or were those the two parts?
30:04
Uh yes.
30:04
In my post-doc, I had built in the Vietnamese Women’s
30:07
Health Project part three.
30:09
And so, then it was where I was like, “Okay, where do we want to go from here?
30:14
Do we need more data or are we ready to do it like a pilot?” And, working with
30:20
the community advisory board members, there were those who were, who worked on
30:25
the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project for prior, stayed on, while others stepped
30:31
back from their role and then there were others that was, were really interested.
30:37
And so, then we had a mixed make-up of a new community advisory board.
30:42
And so, with that, we thought, let’s focus on, what is it that--who
30:47
haven’t we formally heard from?
30:49
And so, we wanted to focus on primary providers—nurse practitioners and medical
30:55
physicians—to also get their perspective because we weren’t quite sure, what
31:00
if we needed to have an intervention study that also included, like,
31:07
intervention or education for providers.
31:11
We weren’t quite sure if that’s where the data would be leading us, but
31:15
we were hoping that it would help to inform to get the primary providers
31:19
perspective around cervical cancer screening and cancer screening in general.
31:25
And then, we try to broaden where, for, maybe, we’ll have providers
31:29
that will be able to speak on their experience around Vietnamese immigrant
31:34
women as well as U.S. born women.
31:36
So, we wanted to build, look at that piece too.
31:40
So, right now, we are in,
31:44
like, manuscript preparation stage, and we’ve presented it at conferences
31:48
too, and it’s been well received.
31:51
So is that part three portion part of the sustainability piece?
31:55
Yes.
31:55
If you train and educate the providers then they can continue to
31:59
work with the community long-term?
32:02
Is that…?
32:02
Oh.
32:03
And, thank you for your clarification ‘cuz--since it’s more exploratory, so, we
32:07
haven’t--it wasn’t an intervention, but it was more of, like, in-depth interview.
32:14
And we kept the questions really broad, too, so that way to see what their
32:20
understanding and their experience with the Vietnamese immigrant and U.S. born
32:25
women in terms of their beliefs around screening, including cervical cancer
32:32
screening, cancer screening, and then timing and decision to seek medical care.
32:38
And so, it was still in an exploratory.
32:42
And we’re hoping to see with this, the data from all three projects, how
32:48
it will inform a pilot intervention.
32:50
So that’s what we’re looking at.
32:51
Oh okay, so the intervention might be the next step, or you’re
32:54
thinking that will be the next step?
32:55
Mm-hm, might be.
32:55
That’s what we’re thinking.
32:56
Okay.
32:57
Wonderful.
33:00
So, during this time, you’ve been--you mentioned working with the community
33:05
advisory board for the health project, specifically, but when did AFC invite
33:11
you to be a board member for AFC in general for that advisory board?
33:17
Oh, yes.
33:18
And so, this was—and it was actually when I was in my post-doc, and I had attended,
33:26
it was, the IRCO AFC celebration.
33:29
And so, they have, like, their holiday potluck that they do
33:35
as, as a community celebrating.
33:39
And so, I was invited to that, and that was when the director of
33:45
IRCO AFC had formally extended a personal invitation for me to apply
33:52
to be an IRCO AFC board member.
33:56
And so, then it was, I want to say, summer of 2012, that was when
34:02
I was formally began my role.
34:08
What is the application process like?
34:12
There’s, there’s one where you’re submitting your resume or your curriculum
34:15
vitae, so that way they can look at your experiences in terms of what, from
34:22
professional, including, like, community experiences and projects that I’ve
34:28
worked on and so—or folks have worked on.
34:32
And then there’s the open-ended questions, so that way they can get a
34:37
sense of who I am and what I’ve done.
34:42
And so, that was really nice that there was, like, this mixed-methods
34:44
approach to the application.
34:46
So, it’s an essay that you write, that they ask you to write?
34:48
Yeah, like, short kind-of essays.
34:51
Interesting.
34:52
And, but I—that was really nice ‘cuz they, it was more where, it was
34:57
where they provided us an option, so then I put it in a cover letter.
35:02
And so, it was nice that this, like, “Oh I get to, they’re like wanting to
35:07
know me on paper as well as what my background experience.” And, but reading
35:16
through the packet, that was where it was where I saw it was like really a living
35:21
process. Like, I got to learn about, more about the board ‘cuz I would hear
35:26
about it, but I was like, I don’t think I personally have, like, interacted, like,
35:32
directly with advisory board for AFC.
35:36
So it was--I was intrigued.
35:39
Definitely.
35:40
So, can you talk a little bit about your duties as a board member?
35:45
So, what is it that you do as part of the AFC advisory board?
35:48
Yes.
35:48
So, this is where—and, it depends, too—like, and I mentioned the word
35:53
“depends” ‘cuz in the beginning, since I was still learning about my role, that
35:59
was the goal I - it’s like, okay what is, what is it that I do, and I hope
36:04
I’m fulfilling what is expected of me.
36:07
That was my main question, too.
36:09
And, because we have, like, like every other month, so like bi-monthly
36:15
meetings; that was that first year when I was formally on the board.
36:22
And I got to provide advisement on, when there was posed questions.
36:29
And so, that was where it was, where I got to really see how my background helped
36:35
to inform how I go about even thinking of engaging in the discussion piece.
36:44
So if, let’s say, Mr. Lee Po Cha would bring up that this is where we’re
36:49
heading and this is where we would like to have discussion with the board
36:55
to seek your inputs on whether it’s, maybe, something that has to do with
36:59
a program, or maybe in general about funding, or, like, where we see IRCO
37:06
AFC in five or ten years from now.
37:09
And so, there’s that visionary piece.
37:12
And, that’s where I find my role is because I, I work as a nurse—so
37:18
I’m a professional nurse—and I’m also an educator up at the school of
37:23
nursing at OHSU, and then I’m also, I also conduct research, and so I
37:29
have those three different main hats.
37:32
And then, I’m also a community member, so that’s like my other hat.
37:38
And being a mother of twins—not at that time, but now I am--something
37:42
in the maternal perspective too.
37:45
But, that’s something that’s really important, is that drawing from one’s
37:52
own background to help inform the input and advisement that I give.
37:58
And so, I really try to be thoughtful, and I would find that that’s
38:04
something that seems to be helpful.
38:09
And so, that’s, that was more of my when I was learning my role.
38:12
And now, I’m elected as the co-chair of IRCO AFC.
38:18
And so, I am still waiting when the formal--I think, the next
38:24
meeting will be when I get to learn more about that leadership role.
38:33
Has being a part of the advisory board enhanced your perspective in
38:39
working with communities or other parts of your job and what you do?
38:45
Yes.
38:45
And so, this is where because I get to work with those who have their other
38:52
professional hats on and the things that they do in the community-wise,
38:57
that has really, I feel like I have, like, more of the enlightening thinking
39:06
and really get to see issues at, like, the trees and also at the grass roots.
39:13
And that, that, to me, has been very humbling.
39:19
And, the reason why I mention the word humbling is because we really get
39:24
to--it’s like really getting to really hear each other and then hearing it from
39:31
those who are, maybe, they have worked with certain communities of color.
39:38
And so, to hear those perspectives that’s being raised by community
39:43
members, and here’s someone who’s an advisory board member that is
39:49
speaking in a representative way, but not, like, speaking where—I want
39:55
to be respectful how I phrase this.
39:58
But, it’s like, we’re not trying to say that we know how the community’s
40:02
feeling, but we’re making sure that we’re trying to bring their voice in
40:07
too as we give input and advisement.
40:10
So, I’m hearing from those who’ve been really have—they are so humble
40:16
histories and have worked so closely with IRCO AFC for several years.
40:25
And, just to see the oozing passion.
40:28
That’s my kind of phrase.
40:29
I’m like, “Oh my gosh, there’s so much work that they have done.” And
40:34
they continue to be so humble, and then they make sure that they’re
40:37
putting the voices of the community.
40:40
And then, there’s things that they’re doing that has been protecting the
40:44
community—maybe it’s in media, or from those who have backgrounds as lawyers,
40:50
others in the education system, or English as a second language programs,
40:55
for example, and then, those where they’re seeing hardships in the community.
41:01
And, to be in a room with others who are professionals and they’re speaking from
41:07
their heart, it just makes me feel that much more engaged, that much more aware.
41:17
And so, it makes, it helps to inform my own practice, so that way, whatever it
41:23
is that I’m doing outside the walls, I’m like, “Okay, this is what I’m seeing.”
41:28
So that part is really wonderful in terms of being a part of the board.
41:35
So, with your expertise being as a health educator and a researcher,
41:44
are there—but, in the board, you talk about many different things and many
41:47
different issues, do you bring that particular perspective to the board?
41:54
Are there—do you have any examples of where, maybe, there was a
41:58
discussion of a certain project and you brought in your perspective as
42:03
a researcher, as a health educator?
42:04
Does anything come to mind?
42:06
Oh.
42:06
Yes.
42:07
So, the other, the other hat that I wear is I’m also on the Steering
42:12
Committee, which is also an advisory board for the Asian Pacific Islander
42:17
Community Leadership Institute, otherwise known as APICLI, A-P-I-C-L-I.
42:24
And that is a program that’s a part of IRCO AFC as well as APANO, the Asian
42:32
Pacific American Network of Oregon.
42:34
And, I was selected as one of the candidates for their year one cohort
42:41
and then, got personally invited by the project coordinator—at
42:45
that time was [sp?] —to apply and be a Steering Committee member.
42:52
So, the nice part is I get to have that other perspective from that board.
42:59
So, when—and, that’s a really important program because it’s, we’re a part
43:04
of the state-wide movement in terms of really looking at empowerment
43:11
within communities and then with, from within ourselves, too.
43:15
And, it’s based on an evidence-based popular education model.
43:21
And so, that’s something where I find that I can bring in that input.
43:27
And, because for that year one I was actually the only person with a healthcare
43:32
perspective, so we, I was like, “Hm, we need more because I’m hearing some of
43:41
the fellows talk about community health needs.” And so, for year two, as part
43:47
of being a Steering Committee member, I was able to, like, delve more into
43:54
depth in terms of the action part and really helping to try to reach out to
44:00
potential candidates for them to apply.
44:05
And, it is competitive, so it’s not where I tell them that’s it
44:08
guaranteed, so it’s not that.
44:11
But, but, but I would make sure that I would voice when the time
44:15
came around, like, decisions.
44:17
And, they wanted to see, you know, why did you think this person is someone
44:21
who had another healthcare background?
44:23
And that’s when I was able to mention, that because from year one, I was the only
44:28
person with a healthcare background and doing the community action project, which
44:33
was focused on health and research, but really finding that this was something
44:39
that was identified from the fellows that they wanted more of something like this.
44:45
So, I think that we should be thoughtful in terms of having a fellow that also,
44:52
that has a healthcare background.
44:55
And so, they were, like, saying, “That makes sense.”
44:58
And then, like--and it’s coming from the fellows.
44:59
So, because I was there for the year one and I was also an advisory board member
45:07
for AFC getting the bigger picture, so when they did program updates, I
45:12
would share back in terms of, like,
45:18
what my perspective.
45:20
And, and that’s that part that my other colleagues in the AFC board is like, “Oh.”
45:28
Because they’re like, “Oh, that’s right, because Connie’s like literally there”
45:32
at the meetings that she’s seeing that.
45:34
So, I felt that helped to create a more in-depth input and advisement.
45:41
And, and for me, I love to try to find ways to give back.
45:46
And so, this was a really great way.
45:49
And then, Mr. Lee Po Cha, he had brought up—because this is the last year for
45:56
the APLICI, the community leadership institute, year three, they’re gonna
45:59
graduate their third cohort in March.
46:02
And, I got to actually be, I attended one of their half, I attended a
46:11
half-day workshop—they do full-day.
46:14
It was, it’s just really inspiring to see the fellows, and what are
46:21
things that they are doing, and what they’re passionate about.
46:24
And so, when I was hearing about the update that this was the last year,
46:28
and that we’re trying to think of, like, what the next step is in terms
46:32
of sustainability and funding-wise.
46:35
And also, challenges—challenges and strategies in terms of continuing
46:41
with trusting partnerships even from within for the institute.
46:47
And so, I was able to provide my input in terms of, like, if things get phrased
46:55
or done in a certain way, this is what might happen and will the funding
47:01
agency may be concerned about something.
47:04
So, I would be describing that.
47:08
And so, I got to bring in my other hat, my research hat, and to show that
47:14
this would be a barrier and what this would mean and I don't know if that’s
47:18
gonna hurt for the future funding.
47:20
And so, that’s where I find that I get to really delve into depth and really
47:26
be in that role of a board member.
47:29
And, because I have the lived experience of being a fellow for the year one
47:34
and then continuing as a Steering Committee and that advisory board
47:38
member role for the APICLI program, which is within IRCO AFC, and APANO,
47:43
and then here, it’s like, okay big picture perspective, IRCO AFC advisory
47:48
board where we’re looking at next step.
47:51
I was, like, able to help with that.
47:54
So, cohort one, was that 2013?
47:57
I’m trying to think.
47:59
Um, it started July of 2012 and then graduated their first year cohort
48:10
one, I want to say, it was December of
48:16
2012.
48:16
But then, as a senior cohort, you can still continue.
48:21
So, there’s funding where it was supporting the seniors and
48:24
the new cohort that’s coming in.
48:26
So, that’s, that’s the part that, where--I was mentioning IRCO AFC--they’re
48:31
always thinking about sustainability and that continuing fostering that
48:36
engagement piece ‘cuz it’s so important.
48:39
So, what was—what is it that you did as part of that cohort?
48:43
Did you have a special project that you worked on?
48:46
Can you share a little bit about that?
48:47
Yes.
48:48
So this is where either as a fellow--either you, yourself,
48:52
or maybe you’re going to, like, work with another fellow.
48:55
So, I was able to work with another fellow for a community action project.
49:03
And so, the great thing is the things that I was learning at the workshops.
49:08
And the workshops are led by the fellows themselves.
49:12
So that was already, like, wow.
49:14
We are not only just—we’re not only learning but we are being active
49:18
participants in our own learning by being the ones putting on the workshop.
49:23
So that was, that was a deep breathing moment for all of us.
49:28
And, and for me, I love public speaking.
49:31
I was like, “Oh,” and I was one of the first that was doing that. And, it
49:37
was around communication and then also dealing with difficult conversations,
49:45
too. And that is such an important piece that helped to inform as I
49:51
was looking at the new remix for the community advisory board for the
49:58
Vietnamese Women’s Health Project three.
49:59
So, things that I was learning concurrently in the APICLI was
50:05
help—directly relevant and informing not only my research, but where I was
50:11
able to co-create the community action project with those who wanted to have
50:17
more hands-on in terms of learning about research by being the ones…
50:23
Also, we put on research workshops.
50:26
And so, that was part of the action project that I did.
50:30
And, one of the fellows, he really—he says, he says, “My background is I’m
50:35
a financial advisor, I don’t have any experience with research, but I have
50:41
people experience.” And he says, “I’m not Vietnamese, I’m not a woman.” And,
50:47
but, I—but, he was saying how he, he thinks health is really important,
50:53
that women’s health is important.
50:55
And so, it was nice to have his, um,
51:02
partnering on this community action project ‘cuz it—when he was there,
51:05
during the advisory meeting, that presence to show that we are doing
51:11
this because of our commitment to the community, it spoke volumes to that, our
51:17
new remix community advisory board for the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project.
51:21
And they, it’s the first time that some of them have ever even
51:24
met the other fellow and myself.
51:27
So, there was already like, we’re building trust.
51:31
And then, I’m like, “This is so great, I get to utilize…” And I even asked,
51:36
“Is it okay if I use some of the tools that I’m learning from the workshop
51:41
in APICLI over to the community action/the research project?” They’re
51:45
like, “Yes, that’s what it’s for.” So that’s where it was really helpful.
51:51
And we did a three series community research workshop.
51:58
And the topics—it was co-created with myself and the community
52:04
members, in particular those who were co-facilitating the workshop.
52:09
So, we were doing it together.
52:11
And I was telling them, if I tell you what the topic is and what we’re going
52:16
to do, then it becomes about myself.
52:19
And this is not about myself, it’s about us and what do you think
52:23
is important for your learning.
52:25
And so, that was the main emphasis of the community action project
52:30
was: how do they become active participants in the research project?
52:36
And how they learn about research is that they’re going to be
52:39
teaching it to each other.
52:41
And then they said—they were asking, “Can we can open it up so that we can
52:45
invite those, maybe, they’re not, like, on the community advisory board for the
52:49
Vietnamese Women’s Health Project but, maybe, that way we can get more community
52:54
members who might be interested?” And so, I was like, “That’s a really great idea.
52:59
Let’s do that.” So, that idea came from the community members
53:04
who was co-facilitating.
53:06
And so, as I learned over on APICLI, I was like, “Oh coalition building, oh.” They
53:12
are like-- look at that, they’re already thinking about community organizing and
53:16
community advocacy, and they feel safe to bring up their ideas, so they were
53:22
feeling empowered. So I was like, that’s a really important principle for CBPR.
53:27
And then, we’re talking about empowerment from within, from the
53:30
popular education model, from APICLI.
53:32
So that’s where it was really nice to have that - being informing.
53:40
Wonderful.
53:41
Well, it sounds like the work that you did was exactly what that leadership institute
53:47
was hoping for, that people in the profession and with the community would
53:53
put into action what they were working on.
53:55
That’s wonderful.
53:57
So, a little bit more about that program.
53:59
How many fellows were in that program, in that cohort with you?
54:03
I’m trying to think.
54:04
I want—I apologize, the number is leaving my mind because we had, like, a
54:11
few fellows, due to life circumstances, had stepped and resigned back.
54:20
So, I think we had 20—I want to say 22.
54:24
But that’s still a really great number, and that—and so, year one
54:33
by far has been, like, the largest of the cohort.
54:38
And, because it was so new, it definitely, we really felt that we were like in
54:44
that co-creating together for that year.
54:49
And that really was such an inspiring—it’s like we were inspiring each other.
54:56
I was just amazed at
55:02
all the work that we’d done.
55:04
And that’s, that’s—we’re like thinking, wow we’re 22, but we
55:08
feel like we’re, like, small but, yet, big--if it makes sense.
55:11
Definitely, with the impact that you have, yes.
55:16
So, you were a Steering Committee member for that for year two.
55:20
For the year three of the program, were you also on the Steering Team?
55:23
You continued on?
55:24
Yes.
55:25
Yes.
55:25
Okay.
55:26
And then, you mentioned that year three, they’re graduating in this spring.
55:32
And then, there are thoughts about move—next steps, or have there
55:36
been discussions about next steps?
55:38
So, so we, we’ve had discussions about next steps in terms of, like,
55:43
where do we go from here in terms of, like, thinking about funding?
55:47
Because, the APICLI’s funded through the, primarily from the Meyer Memorial Trust.
55:54
And, one of the
55:58
parts, from what I understand from Dr. Paru Wong [sp?] –cuz, she’s
56:08
now the evaluator of the APICLI, but she was formerly the director of APICLI.
56:16
So, she was sharing that, that there’s that plan where they—‘cuz Meyer Memorial
56:25
Trust said that, you know, “We’ll fund you through this X amount of years, but
56:31
that it’s important that you think about what you’re next steps are.” And so, that
56:37
part, we’ve been having conversations.
56:41
But I think it’s definitely something that’s still a very important ongoing
56:45
conversation, too, in terms of—so, there’s been, like, discussion from
56:52
among staff from what I understand in terms of like who would be potential
57:00
funders that they would be looking at.
57:02
But, I don’t know if we’re quite at the determination yet in terms of
57:10
where exactly we’re going from here.
57:13
But, that we know that sustainability piece is so important ‘cuz then, now,
57:17
we have three cohorts who are being active and working on community action
57:25
projects and things they’re doing out there in respective communities
57:30
and wanting to make sure to,
57:34
to embrace the energy from the, those, the three cohorts so that way to
57:41
continue with our statewide collective movement in terms of empowerment.
57:48
Well, you mention statewide.
57:50
So, AFC mostly focuses on the Portland area, Multnomah County,
57:57
but, do you, does your project in particular expand to the state, or
58:01
is it also mostly Portland-based—the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project.
58:04
Oh, thank you.
58:04
For the Vietnamese
58:08
Women’s Health Project, so far, it’s been in the Portland,
58:11
Oregon, metropolitan areas.
58:15
So, mostly, like, in terms of from Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas.
58:22
And that mirrors the community needs assessment survey, it
58:26
was that tri-county area too.
58:28
There, there was questions--some community members were wondering
58:33
about, what about—‘cuz there’s a Vietnamese community out in Salem,
58:39
so I’ve heard those questions.
58:42
We haven’t, for the Vietnamese Women’s Health Project, have stemmed into the, in
58:50
Salem or other more distance rural areas.
58:55
And it’s just more, like, trying to think of where—‘cuz we’re still in steps, so
59:00
it’s like wanting to make sure what we’re doing here, and then, and then, if it
59:06
has, like, an effect, then do we move outwards or do we go ahead and do more?
59:11
So we’re always trying to think of, like, transportation and how, if
59:17
it’s an education intervention and that’s what we’re looking at, then
59:21
how do we, do we mobilize ourselves or do we mobilize participants.
59:27
So that’s, that always becomes a really, really hard question.
59:32
But, definitely, that’s something that I know for myself that I need to continue
59:37
to work with the community members on in terms of, like, what are geographic.
59:44
Or, the other one, the APICLI, definitely in terms of, like, fellows for year
59:51
two and year three, even more of a strategic effort and really trying to
59:55
get like out in the rural, like Eugene.
59:58
So, there’s those who are further away.
1:00:02
I think for year one, we only had, like, one.
1:00:06
So, still trying to, like, think of ways so that we can have community members
1:00:11
who are doing very important work out there, that what kind of resources
1:00:17
and what they can have so that when they go back out in the rural area,
1:00:22
that they still have that support.
1:00:24
So, it’s still, it’s still a very challenging question.
1:00:28
How do we stem outside?
1:00:32
But, definitely that, that effort is definitely there.
1:00:36
So that’s a great thing—great thing that APICLI is doing.
1:00:41
So, you’re—the projects that you’re working on pertaining to Vietnamese
1:00:46
women’s health, are similar projects happening with other community groups
1:00:53
within AFC or within IRCO in general?
1:00:57
Is that—are there other women’s groups within the immigrant community that also
1:01:02
are in need of this type of research assistance or not that you know of?
1:01:07
Can you share a little bit about that?
1:01:09
Like, in terms of, like, in general or, like, programs within AFC?
1:01:15
Either.
1:01:16
Oh, okay.
1:01:17
So, based on what I, in general-wise—and this is, like, because of my
1:01:26
being able to meet and talk with other fellows in the
1:01:29
APICLI—there are women groups.
1:01:33
So there’s one that’s, for example, a Pacific Islander group where she would
1:01:39
tell, “My sisters and I, we’re really looking at in terms of how to really think
1:01:48
about, like, women and violence issues.” And so, maybe, like, with that. And then,
1:01:56
I would hear, for example, from another fellow where her background is Filipino,
1:02:02
and so she’s with the Filipino Commerce.
1:02:06
And so, looking at when there are, like, what’s going on in the Philippines.
1:02:13
So, thinking even across seas and doing philanthropy work to help fundraise
1:02:18
when there was a natural disaster.
1:02:21
And so, I’ll hear—so, I’m hearing very really strong advocacy voices for what
1:02:29
they’re doing with their respective communities that’s maybe outside of AFC.
1:02:36
And then, I also—within the AFC, when I first started there—and
1:02:41
I always like to go back to my original roots at AFC—there was like
1:02:45
different projects that were going on.
1:02:47
And, there was one that was called the HAPI project.
1:02:50
And, I think they were using the acronym, H-A-P-I.
1:02:54
And, it was an intervention research study, and it was open up to Asian
1:02:59
and Pacific Islander couples.
1:03:02
And this was really targeting an educational intervention study.
1:03:08
So, that was where the project was really focusing on and, again,
1:03:12
particularly for API couples.
1:03:15
So, that was—there was collaboration with OHSU and IRCO AFC with that.
1:03:20
And then, another one was called the Hepatitis B, HIV
1:03:25
Education Prevention Project.
1:03:27
And so, with that one, they were really honing in in terms of, like, vaccination.
1:03:34
And then, IRCO AFC partnering with the Multnomah County health department,
1:03:39
and so they were working with a nurse supervisor and really trying to, like,
1:03:43
how do we, are able to provide Hepatitis B vaccinations and also doing the
1:03:51
Hepatitis B, like, blood draw screening.
1:03:55
And so, being able to, like, have, recruit nurse volunteers who were registered
1:04:03
nurses and licensed and was able to do the actual vaccination and blood draws.
1:04:10
So that one, they were doing that.
1:04:13
And then we, I remember the Tobacco Prevention Education Project.
1:04:17
And, now we know that’s, like, law here in Oregon.
1:04:20
But, I got to see and hear about the hard work they were doing with, like,
1:04:25
from quantitative and qualitative.
1:04:28
And so, they were interviewing and really getting input from the community members
1:04:33
in terms of around smoking and practices around smoking and thoughts and ideas from
1:04:42
community members in terms of what would be helpful resource for them so that way
1:04:49
they can feel that they can quit smoking.
1:04:51
And so, so that was really great in terms of hearing about that.
1:04:57
So, lots of different projects happening, like, outside and within AFC.
1:05:02
And usually, when I hear of, like, the Tobacco Prevention Education
1:05:07
Project, what I was hearing that they were really trying to, like,
1:05:12
try to minimize the language barrier.
1:05:14
And so, they had, like, I don’t know if it was eight, but there was, like,
1:05:18
a certain number amount of where they were able to translate educational
1:05:22
materials in different languages.
1:05:24
And so, always trying to see how to reduce barriers so that way for those
1:05:31
who are not able to speak English can also, like, receive education.
1:05:40
So, you are soon—you’ve been elected as co-chair of the AFC board and you’ve been
1:05:48
on the Steering Committee for APICLI.
1:05:51
Are there any other community organizations that you have connected
1:05:55
with that you, or, perhaps, that you would like to connect with and be a part of?
1:06:00
Um, I definitely am trying to think of how I can.
1:06:06
‘Cuz, I,--and sometimes, it’s one of those where it’s really
1:06:12
important to be proactive, too.
1:06:14
So this is where, like, talking with other folks helps to
1:06:16
like, oh what’s going on there.
1:06:18
And so, so I remembered when I was talking with Reverend Joseph Santos-Lyons, and
1:06:23
he’s the executive director at APANO.
1:06:27
And we were actually putting together a web—we were prepared for
1:06:34
a webinar about, like, around health disparities issues, for example.
1:06:40
And, that’s when I learned more about, at that time, was the House Bill 2134 really
1:06:48
looking at improved data collection on race, ethnicity, language, and disability
1:06:53
status for Health and Human Services.
1:06:56
So, I got to, like, hear the beginnings of that project.
1:07:03
And, because of that, I was like, “I really want to be part of that, Joseph.”
1:07:06
This just, like, really resonates with what I’ve been doing with research
1:07:11
work with the community members, really trying to show that it’s important that
1:07:16
we are not aggregating Asian Pacific Islanders in one group because there
1:07:22
may be, like—when we think of, like, disparities, certain communities of color
1:07:27
may be experiencing a disproportionate burden of a particular health disease
1:07:33
or illnesses. And so, I was invited to attend and see if it’s something
1:07:42
that I would be able to commit to.
1:07:44
And I was.
1:07:45
And, they make phone conferencing available, helping to reduce a location
1:07:50
barrier so that way that was really nice.
1:07:53
And so, I got to learn about the beginning health policy.
1:07:57
And then, I stayed on as a member of the Oregon Date Equity Coalition and so I
1:08:03
got to help in providing testimonials.
1:08:05
And then, during
1:08:10
the meetings itself, getting to provide advisement and input and
1:08:15
seeing the role model of APANO ‘cuz it was their first time really,
1:08:19
like, looking at developing a bill.
1:08:23
And then, seeing how things gets actions and what’s going on moved on the floor.
1:08:28
And, so I got to go to the capital too and learned a lot.
1:08:33
So I got to have, like, the big picture and saw it from the beginning.
1:08:37
And so, that was really important coalition work.
1:08:41
And now that it’s become law, so I--now I get to hear about the behind
1:08:48
the scenes nuts and bolts of, of how they’re, how they were making the rules
1:08:55
around how it even gets implemented.
1:08:57
I was like, “Woah, this is definitely the sustainability piece.” ‘Cuz, it’s like
1:09:02
wanting to make sure that it continues, and so I get to learn about that.
1:09:07
And how long did that process take?
1:09:10
That one, for the, for the House Bill 2134 was actually where we,
1:09:15
as a group, convened in that fall and by that May, late spring, early
1:09:23
summer, it was able to become law.
1:09:27
So that was actually something for me, I was like, “Woah, I don’t, is that
1:09:33
typical? I….” So it was hard for me to gauge since it was my first time
1:09:37
being involved in learning about health policy and what goes into that process.
1:09:43
And, it was because of the strategies that was being implemented and who to
1:09:51
talk to and thinking about allies, and so it was—they were really making sure
1:09:56
that they were staying on timeline and lobbying efforts who were doing the,
1:10:04
who were the lobbyists for that bill and the hard work that they’ve done, too.
1:10:10
And so, that really helps to move things along.
1:10:12
And, but I was like, “Wow, yes.”
1:10:17
That’s wonderful.
1:10:18
Is that something that interests you—policy and law making?
1:10:23
That does cuz it’s really empowering to, like, know that it, that it’s so important
1:10:27
to have that collective effort and, in particular, because of the research
1:10:32
I’m doing with the community members.
1:10:33
And I was like, this is resonating.
1:10:36
So then, when it became law, the community members were like, “Did you just say
1:10:41
that the research we were a part of in doing, like, helped directly drove health
1:10:47
pol—that health policy change?” I was like, “Yes.” “Woah, that’s so awesome.” Or
1:10:52
like, you know, they’d like tell me this.
1:10:54
So it’s like seeing the fruits of one’s work, and that they were a part
1:11:00
of that and we’re doing it together.
1:11:02
So that, that further was where that empowerment--so they just felt like we
1:11:10
were a part of being a change agent.
1:11:12
So that was what I was hearing from community members.
1:11:16
Wonderful.
1:11:18
Wonderful.
1:11:18
And you mentioned this a little bit, but can you summarize,
1:11:21
briefly, what the law does and how it, how it benefits communities?
1:11:26
So this is where—one of the things that, that was getting concerning
1:11:31
is that, because we hear the word either Asian ethnicity or Asian and
1:11:37
Pacific Islander, but there’s, like, several different subgroups within
1:11:42
that bigger racial, ethnic group.
1:11:45
And, even though sometimes the other way that I would hear the counter-argument
1:11:52
would be, would be the concern of how does one even start to learn
1:11:58
all the differences across cultures.
1:12:01
This is where it was more, more in terms about we can still be strategic
1:12:07
and think about how we even think about health and data collection and
1:12:13
what we’re actually collecting it on.
1:12:16
So, if we’re wanting to try to understand that maybe it’s a particular disease.
1:12:21
If we’re saying heart disease or we’re saying cervical cancer or whatever
1:12:26
that illness, whatever the illness is, and then you are, are making sure that
1:12:31
you’re letting the person be the one to identify what their, what do you
1:12:37
identify as, as racial, ethnic background.
1:12:39
So that’s, to even have that conversation is important.
1:12:44
And so, then, when you’re piecing and having in a data collection quantitative
1:12:49
way, it will help to show patterns.
1:12:53
Gee, you know, why is there, maybe, an increase incidence in, with
1:12:58
this particular racial, ethnic background, and with this illness.
1:13:03
Is there something that we need to be thinking about?
1:13:06
We need to be thinking about what are cultural values or cultural
1:13:10
beliefs around this illness?
1:13:12
So that, so it’s meant to, like, open a door to even know how to have
1:13:18
a conversation and asking—so, like, almost like a guide in that way.
1:13:23
And that’s what we want.
1:13:24
We want it to be where it helps to, like, stimulate to
1:13:28
be, like, “Hmm, I need to ask.
1:13:31
I need to ask my patient or I need to ask the person that I am providing care for.
1:13:36
‘What is their ethnic background?
1:13:38
What is, what are things that they are knowing about this?
1:13:44
And what are things that
1:13:48
maybe being done as a cultural practice that might, might be a barrier?’ ” And,
1:13:53
if I don’t ask the conversation and open it up and even begin that, might
1:13:58
not be able to even get to the part of the treatment or the assessment
1:14:03
procedure until that conversation can even—we need that conversation to begin.
1:14:12
Wonderful.
1:14:14
So, I’m curious about your role at OHSU.
1:14:18
You mentioned that you’re an educator and so, do you teach classes?
1:14:22
Do you mentor other nurses?
1:14:26
Do you work with doctors?
1:14:27
Can you talk a little bit about your role as an educator?
1:14:29
Yes.
1:14:30
And so, I primarily teach in the undergraduate programs, so those
1:14:35
are pre-licensure nursing students.
1:14:38
And also, there are those who are transfers from community
1:14:43
colleges and they already have their registered nursing license.
1:14:48
And I do do guest lecturing in for some of the PhD classes as a guest speaker
1:14:55
in terms around research methods and community-based participatory research.
1:14:59
So I do do that, too.
1:15:01
And so, I,
1:15:04
with teaching-wise, it’s from either health promotions, so, foundations
1:15:12
around even about what is health and there’s certain fundamental skills too.
1:15:22
So that includes, for example, like, vital signs, checking blood pressure,
1:15:26
temperature, your pulse, respirations, to even understanding how to do a whole head
1:15:32
to toe physical assessment on patients.
1:15:37
So, there’s that importance of collecting data and then integrating the importance
1:15:43
of health literacy, plain language, cultural sensitivity, building that trust.
1:15:48
We need them to do that before you even lay hands on your patient.
1:15:52
So, there’s that cultural piece to that.
1:15:55
And then, the other, in terms of understanding, like, sick
1:15:59
medication administration practices.
1:16:03
And all of the things that gets taught, it’s important that—and my other
1:16:10
colleague shared this, this philosophy to us—that it’s evidence based.
1:16:15
It’s not just because, well, we say so, and that’s how we’ve been doing it.
1:16:18
It’s like, oh, well this is what the research is saying, this is what the
1:16:21
evidence is for doing it in a particular way or this is the approach we’re
1:16:26
doing now, which is different from how technology was before and now it’s
1:16:31
advanced, so, therefore, this is, these are things that evidence suggests, and
1:16:36
that helps to inform nursing practice.
1:16:39
And so, that’s a really important part, is that it’s evidence-based practice versus
1:16:46
assuming or that’s how it’s been done.
1:16:49
Other thing is I also teach in the integrated practicum.
1:16:53
And so, that’s usually the last course that students have, and it’s where
1:17:00
they get a certain number of direct precepted patient-care hours as well
1:17:07
as time that helps to supplement and build their learning about
1:17:14
their specialty nursing practice.
1:17:17
So, this is where it’s really close to the time that they’re graduating.
1:17:21
And so, helping to be that bridge in terms of -- ‘cuz they’ll be transitioning into
1:17:29
professional practices, new graduates,
1:17:34
and really looking at their clinical judgment.
1:17:37
I’m not saying we don’t do that in the beginning because that’s very important.
1:17:40
We do that and then we build on it, and then, by this time, we really
1:17:45
hone in in terms of critical thinking, clinical judgment, integrating more
1:17:50
and more in terms of, like, that art of practice and how you communicate
1:17:54
with the patient and what it means to provide holistic care as well.
1:17:59
And that it’s patient centered, family centered, not just about the task
1:18:05
itself or giving someone an IM shot.
1:18:08
How do you got about doing that to make sure that the patient will come back again
1:18:13
versus them remembering that traumatizing, one time, they may not want to come see
1:18:18
a provider until they’re really sick.
1:18:20
And they remember that one moment that was really traumatizing for them.
1:18:26
So it’s like trying to think of the big picture.
1:18:29
So, when, when, you are teaching in your classes, you’re thinking
1:18:33
about framing it within cultural sensitivity and communities’ practices?
1:18:37
Yes.
1:18:37
That’s wonderful that you get to share for up and coming, for future providers that
1:18:43
you’re sharing your knowledge with them.
1:18:47
That’s great.
1:18:47
Yes, yes.
1:18:47
Thank you.
1:18:47
So, in terms of your—coming back to your role as an AFC board member—you’ve
1:18:56
mentioned this a little bit already, you actually have mentioned it quite a bit,
1:18:59
in terms of the role of the AFC within Oregon’s immigrant and refugee community.
1:19:04
But, any, any just general thoughts on that or anything that you’d
1:19:08
like to add in terms of what you feel the AFC’s role is within the
1:19:13
immigrant and refugee community?
1:19:15
In terms of, like, the broader pictures, it’s looking at—‘cuz, this
1:19:21
is what I hear from when we meet too—is
1:19:28
the future.
1:19:30
And so, thinking about the children, the youth.
1:19:36
And so, that’s, that’s a really important piece ‘cuz what I’m hearing, they’ll
1:19:40
be like, for those who are the elders in AFC and the organization itself,
1:19:46
they said, “We’re gonna be looking at retirement in that time.” And also,
1:19:53
also “what legacy do we want to leave behind for our community, our children?”
1:20:00
And, so that’s, that’s that piece.
1:20:04
It’s that knowing that things that they’ve been doing for several, several years and
1:20:09
decades, and they said, “When we’re not here, we’re wondering what, what would we
1:20:17
want to have AFC or the organization be, knowing we’re not here?” So, I feel that
1:20:26
there’s definitely going to be continuing, very important, ongoing conversations
1:20:31
with that to really look at the vision piece and looking at what we think may
1:20:39
be the needs and who needs to be at the table. So, also, there’s going to be a
1:20:48
future recruiting of who we think needs to be at the IRCO AFC advisory board.
1:20:56
Who isn’t being represented here that we need to be thinking about?
1:21:00
So, even that.
1:21:01
So we’re—so there’s the collectiveness of we, where we’re trying to take that step.
1:21:07
And, having those voices with our combined voices and those who are
1:21:14
elders and youngers and thinking about the generation or cross-generation.
1:21:21
We definitely are having conversations about that so that way we can, we got to,
1:21:27
like, see who needs to be at the table.
1:21:29
And then, from there, okay do we feel we have a diverse voice?
1:21:33
Okay, now, what do we think is going to be for the next, you know, that ten,
1:21:38
20 years, or when so-and-so retires or so-and-so is not part of this world?
1:21:45
And,
1:21:48
what’s going to be there?
1:21:50
And that’s, that’s a hard question to, like, even grapple around.
1:21:55
So, at least we know we’re making that step of trying to think of okay, who
1:21:58
needs to be here now that isn’t here?
1:22:01
And then, that way we can start to have, like, that rippling conversation outwards.
1:22:07
And, I’m hoping that we will continue to think about that idea
1:22:13
of what is going to be there for the children, the “youth” in terms of
1:22:21
what we think they’re going to need.
1:22:23
And, health continues to be one of those important things.
1:22:26
And, preventative health so that way it’s not where there’s a decision that becomes
1:22:34
where one doesn’t go into there really sick and so we may not, science may not be
1:22:40
there in terms having treatment that can help in that if you delayed seeking care
1:22:48
and you’re over here on this trajectory.
1:22:50
And so, there’s that part about really thinking about
1:22:53
community preventive health, too.
1:22:55
So that continues to be an important part of the conversation, is that physiological
1:23:02
health and then also psychological health.
1:23:05
That’s another part too because we have those that are coming, whether
1:23:11
they’re older or younger, but the cultural and the language and so just
1:23:17
even trying to think of how they’re navigating that in today’s modern world.
1:23:25
And now, we have, like, more and more technology like texting on
1:23:29
cell phone and media and iPad.
1:23:35
I don’t own an iPad, but I hear others how they are using information
1:23:40
technology to inform their health.
1:23:43
So, for myself, I’m hoping that we’ll be thinking about even folks who have
1:23:49
access and if they’re going to have access to reliable, credible information.
1:23:55
And so, trying to think of that technology piece is important too
1:24:00
because it’s here to stay, and it’s just getting more and more advanced.
1:24:04
And, trying to think of how does that impact the health of the community
1:24:10
overall of what they can have access to?
1:24:14
Some of the board members who are also board members for IRCO board was talking
1:24:20
about the concern about cyber-safety.
1:24:22
So that was a really, big, important topic that was presented at—‘cuz, we
1:24:28
have an annual AFC retreat where it’s the staff and the advisory board.
1:24:34
So, that’s always a wonderful pleasure.
1:24:37
And, we learn from each other and we’re trying to see how to meet the needs of
1:24:40
the staff, and what are some things that they’re needing that the board can help?
1:24:46
And that does come up a—the issue of cyber safety and the youth.
1:24:51
So, it’s like, not only there’s the health and the illness, but then there’s
1:24:54
the violence that impacts health.
1:24:57
So, we’re trying to see that and so I’m really appreciative that
1:25:02
we’re already taking steps to think about that technology piece and
1:25:07
how it’s impacting the community.
1:25:11
So, in a way you started to answer this question, but I think this is
1:25:15
also, potentially, the tough question that you were mentioning in terms of
1:25:19
recommendations that you have for AFC.
1:25:22
And this could be specific to your fields in terms of health or it could be
1:25:28
recommendations in general, sort of, where you would like AFC move in these next
1:25:34
five, ten, 15 years, especially now with your new leadership role as a co-chair.
1:25:41
This is where, like, really trying to think about when, like, this,
1:25:52
in terms of, like, ‘cuz partnerships—so, I’ve mentioned before, like, how even,
1:25:58
like, with the community needs assessment and there was the partnership with IRCO
1:26:02
AFC and Portland State University and Portland Providence Medical Center.
1:26:07
So, even, like, continuing to think about who—‘cuz overtime, what I understand is
1:26:14
that there will be those who will want to partner with IRCO AFC, but it might
1:26:21
be where because of needing to think about, like, the current funding and
1:26:28
there may be limited staff or limited resource to be able to even partner.
1:26:35
So then, it might not feel like it could be an equal distribution of workload
1:26:42
on top of already a busy workload.
1:26:45
And so, one of my recommendations is to, is more of, like, trying to think,
1:26:50
trying to get in that strategic way.
1:26:52
‘Cuz, it’s like we’re having those who want to partner, but maybe we need
1:26:58
to have guidelines of, like, like, if someone is wanting to approach to partner,
1:27:04
what are things that they’re going to bring that are existing resources?
1:27:09
And then, that way, you know, these are—‘cuz, you might bring a great idea,
1:27:15
you may even bring in, you’ve got the funding part, but if it’s like a person
1:27:21
resource part, what are things that can help to minimize that barrier, especially
1:27:27
during a time when, maybe during that part of the season or year for IRCO
1:27:33
AFC, it might be where they have just completed a project and so, therefore,
1:27:39
not able to dovetail this other project unless there’s this staff person now
1:27:46
who may be now stretched across two programs, I’m just saying for example.
1:27:52
So, if the potential partnering organization have thoughts,
1:27:57
have, like, a guideline, things that they’re thinking about.
1:28:00
So, like, even as simple as a list of questions or maybe a table, and they are
1:28:05
proposing what are the things that they know they can do and what the funding
1:28:10
that they’re applying for if they partner, and this is what it would look like.
1:28:15
I think that would help to have some kind of more of a semi-structured way,
1:28:22
so that way on IRCO AFC, they can look at them, be like, “Okay, now you’ve got
1:28:28
5 out of the 6, I think we can, we can see this part. This part is we’ll okay.
1:28:34
Oh, this part, not so much.” We may need just to have to say no.
1:28:39
So, it’s just more of, like, a systematic approach, especially if
1:28:44
it comes to research and health cuz what I understand is since it’s,
1:28:49
since IRCO AFC is not a research based versus like OHSU is a research
1:28:55
based university or Portland State University is a research, has research.
1:29:00
And so, having to think about they may not have that kind of resources when it comes
1:29:06
to that big of a funding and expectations.
1:29:13
So, even knowing what it is on paper, what are things--if it’s research-wise, these
1:29:18
are things that the potential partnering organization would need to be the one.
1:29:26
But, laying that out more concretely, and I think that might
1:29:30
help to open the communication door just to even with partnering.
1:29:37
It’s like, almost like ground rules, expectations.
1:29:40
And I think that’ll help to build a trusting report too.
1:29:46
‘Cuz, if sometimes you’re going into it and it seems like it’s a good idea
1:29:50
and it’s like, “Oh, I thought this way.” And, “I thought this way.” And
1:29:54
there’s--and it’s just different ways of going about caring for the community.
1:30:00
So, it doesn’t mean that one is right and the other’s wrong, they’re
1:30:04
just, maybe, different philosophies.
1:30:07
So that’s where that can, that can have potential for a communication
1:30:13
that might not open up as well.
1:30:16
And we want to be where, how do we have those difficult conversations so when
1:30:22
there’s partnering going into it, it can be a healthy, ongoing partnership with,
1:30:28
like, things laid out and expectations clearly seen what it was that IRCO AFC
1:30:35
can do and what it is the other partnering community organization or university.
1:30:42
So that’s my more broader.
1:30:45
No, that sounds wonderful.
1:30:46
It sounds similar to when institutions have memorandums of understanding and
1:30:53
just something, like you said, so that upfront people know what to expect.
1:30:57
That sounds great, yes.
1:30:59
Yes, yes.
1:31:00
Any other recommendations that you can think of?
1:31:03
I think
1:31:05
that’s my, like, more broad.
1:31:06
That’s your main one?
1:31:07
My main one.
1:31:07
That sounds wonderful, yes.
1:31:10
So, at this point, is there anything throughout the entire interview that
1:31:15
we have not discussed that you would like to share or anything that we have
1:31:20
talked about that you wanted to go back to?...And this could be about, it could
1:31:31
be further discussion on anything that you’ve talked about from the board or
1:31:35
from the health projects you’ve worked on or from your professional position.
1:31:41
Or, if you think we’ve covered everything, then, then we’ve covered everything.
1:31:44
I think
1:31:47
in closing, my one thing that I didn’t touch but is so
1:31:51
important—I touched briefly.
1:31:54
I was mentioning about how I was really appreciative to have mentoring from staff
1:32:01
when I was partnering, and even though it was those few minutes of conversation,
1:32:07
but the lasting impact it had.
1:32:10
So, I carry that with me because then when I am providing mentoring
1:32:16
with community members, I let them know that I’m learning from them and
1:32:20
they’re also, like, mentoring me.
1:32:23
They don’t think of it in that way, but for me, I try to make sure that
1:32:28
they, they know how important that is, us together learning from each other.
1:32:31
And so, what I learn from community members who really wanted to understand
1:32:38
more about, like, the health care.
1:32:40
And especially, if maybe they’re interested in nursing itself as
1:32:43
a specialty and then also the research side to it, they said that
1:32:52
because of how they felt safe, that they can ask questions from me.
1:32:59
And, it could be diverse from personal questions on how to balance, like,
1:33:05
workload and their own work in school and doing the things that they love and
1:33:10
their passions such as the community projects, such as the Vietnamese
1:33:14
Women’s Health Project, and then to more professional questions such as seeking for
1:33:20
a letter of recommendation or reference.
1:33:23
But, they said that when they are working on things that has to do with
1:33:29
the research, they said that it’s the way that I would explain things that
1:33:34
just makes it just so understandable.
1:33:36
And, they know that rigor is important.
1:33:40
And they said that they, they meant they feel intimidated if they themselves
1:33:46
are presenting at a conference.
1:33:47
And they’re like, “Oh my god, I’m presenting.” And so,
1:33:50
they’re, like, practicing.
1:33:51
And so then--but they said that because they think of, like, how it is working
1:33:58
with myself and then the, and the work that they’ve done, and they’re remembering
1:34:03
those discussions and the debriefing, so even though they feel “uhh!” this
1:34:08
way, and they’re like, here’s others who are, like, PhDs and they have like
1:34:13
different specialty fields—maybe they’re neuroscientists, or, you know, maybe
1:34:19
they’re a public health scientist, or a OBGYN scientist, or a provider—that they
1:34:27
feel that they’re still able to speak very clearly and articulate what it was that
1:34:34
we had learned from the study findings while still being rigorous in making sure
1:34:39
that they’re not going beyond that. And so, those conversations and reflections
1:34:47
that I hear from community members is such an important part of that process,
1:34:53
and it feels so rewarding because I’m seeing that empowerment and hearing it.
1:34:59
So, I get to see it and then I’m hearing them reflecting on it,
1:35:03
and it ties all the way back that this is why they feel engaged.
1:35:08
And, I get so touched when I let them know, you know.
1:35:13
And, I remember I was like, “The funding for the Vietnamese Women’s
1:35:15
Health Project will end by this month and this year, I myself will continue
1:35:20
on with the project to stay committed.
1:35:22
As you know, I do not receive an FTE support for this, but I have
1:35:27
my post-doctoral research.” And then they would be like, “Well
1:35:32
that’s--Connie, I will work for free.” You know, and so, I try to, like,
1:35:36
think of ways to protect their time.
1:35:39
And so, that’s something they always know that I’m conscious about
1:35:43
and that we’re doing it together.
1:35:45
And they said that’s what feels really—it’s like they said they feel
1:35:50
like they’re having fun while learning about something really complex and that,
1:35:56
that they said, “We trust you, Connie.
1:35:58
When Connie says she’s there, we’re not left alone to do this all by ourselves.
1:36:02
It’s like we’re doing it in tandem.” And they said that’s been very meaningful.
1:36:08
And that, to me, is really rewarding to have the mentor, mentee
1:36:13
relationship with community members.
1:36:16
That is wonderful.
1:36:17
Any other closing thoughts that you’d like to share at this time?
1:36:22
No, that would be, that would be everything.
1:36:25
Thank you.
1:36:25
Wonderful.
1:36:26
Well, thank you so much for a wonderful interview.
1:36:28
Well, thank
