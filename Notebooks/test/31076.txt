00:50
And what ethic or cultural background do you identify yourself with?
00:55
Well, I am Lao.
00:57
I come from Laos.
01:00
And when and where were your parents born?
01:05
My
01:08
parents was—were born in Laos.
01:10
I think probably
01:15
in—I was born in 1934, so my parent—my mother I think was born in 1908, like
01:26
that, and my father probably born in
01:31
19—no, sorry, my father was born, I think, in
01:40
1908; my mother was born in 1910.
01:44
Okay.
01:46
And did you grow up there in Laos; did you end up moving here at a young age?
01:52
I
01:55
was born, I grew up in Laos.
01:57
I went to school in elementary and secondary school in Savannakhet in
02:03
southern part of Laos, and then I came to Vientiane and finished my school over
02:12
there, and then I came to United States in 1959, to study at University of Miami.
02:20
And then I went back to Laos after graduation in 1964.
02:25
And back
02:30
and forth.
02:31
So you came by yourself, or did you—
02:33
No, yeah, I came - I got a scholarship from US Government,
02:37
you know, for four years to study
02:41
in the United States.
02:43
What did you study?
02:45
I studied what they called school of government of political science.
02:49
And
02:52
did you want to stay, did you want to come back to the United States,
02:55
or were you thinking of going back to Lao and staying there?
02:58
Well, when I graduate I
03:01
start working at State Department as an escort interpreter for three months.
03:08
Escort the Lao visitors to Laos, and then I went back to Laos.
03:13
I
03:16
worked the government in 1975, when
03:19
I was captured by the communist, and then I came a refugee to the
03:22
United in 19-, let me see, 1983, and start working at IRCO in 1984.
03:34
Did you come by yourself when in you came in the 1980s?
03:39
No, we come; we came as refugees with
03:44
my wife, my three boys.
03:46
Okay, so your family was able to come with you?
03:50
Oh yeah, my family was able to.
03:51
Actually, at that time, I was in Washington D.C. for five month and
03:58
when the fall of the country I went to Laos to get my parent and then I was
04:06
captured by the communists for six years.
04:09
So, after six year in the re-education, I came back and brought
04:15
my family to United, as refugee.
04:20
And so you mentioned you came here and you began working for IRCO.
04:23
Did IRCO originally help you when you first arrived?
04:27
Yeah.
04:28
I start working with IRCO
04:33
in 1984 as a business specialist with the economic development project, you know,
04:40
primarily funded by the Ford Foundation.
04:45
So, when you came originally, what services did IRCO
04:49
provide you and your family?
04:52
Well, I work as a staff—what is it?
04:59
When you originally came, what services did IRCO provide you?
05:03
I’m curious what IRCO was like in the 1980s when you arrived, so what services
05:07
did they provide you and your family?
05:11
Well, I worked as a business specialist actually for about—I was supposed to
05:17
be about three month, and then until now, so we worked with the economic
05:24
development project for seven year, that Ford Foundation, and then I
05:30
go on for another program, what they call the resource specialist.
05:36
And then IRCO sent me to Florida to expand the IRCO program in Florida, and
05:44
then I came back, became the director of international language bank, until we
05:55
set up the Asian Family Center, so I was the center coordinator in 1994.
06:05
Okay.
06:06
So, one of the questions is how long have you been with the AFC, so you
06:11
were here in the very beginning.
06:13
What was that like, setting up the AFC?
06:16
Why was it necessary to create the Asian Family Center?
06:22
Well, Asian Family Center, remember Asian community, or Asian refugee is
06:28
the largest community in Oregon.
06:33
Asia, look at the world, Asia is one
06:39
third of the world population, so there are many refugees from Indochina, I
06:44
mean Cambodian, Lao, Vietnam, and then Thai, and then Vietnamese—so there
06:56
are more needs for
07:01
the children who come here, for family, that they have to
07:05
study, how to adjust to system in
07:13
the United States, you know.
07:15
So, were you one of the original people that had the idea to create the AFC?
07:22
Who were some of the people that also—
07:25
Well, I think at that time IRCO, well, Multnomah County asked IRCO to study the
07:33
need of Asian community, and then they had us—the study, the survey and they made
07:34
a - and they had the committee, the Asian
07:43
committee member of many people, different
07:50
groups from the community, had to start Asian Family Center and
07:56
Multnomah County had a budget and they advocate for the Asian Family
08:02
Center so that that’s the need.
08:05
And why I started?
08:08
At
08:10
that time they interviewed me to be the center coordinator, and so I was accepted.
08:19
At that time, I also was the Asian Youth Leadership Club manager,
08:28
funded by United Way, that we are prior to the—and that’s in 1993.
08:34
So, I worked with that for another year,
08:40
so that’s the reason I apply, because I see that Asian community, there are
08:46
many, many organizations, and many many group, so the Asian Family Center had the
08:54
idea to become like one shopping center.
08:58
The Asian Family Center is set up—at that time it was one of the seven family
09:06
centers, so the people from the Asian community would come to the center
09:12
and then we provided the service to them, what we had.
09:18
But if we cannot provide, we refer to all seven family center in Multnomah County.
09:25
That beginning, before there were only two or three program at the beginning.
09:32
So what were some of the services at the very beginning that AFC provided?
09:37
There
09:41
was access to service, I mean that you know, when the community need, the
09:52
children, the youth, the family, they come to us so they know how to access
09:56
the services, whether in a mainstream service, whether in another center, that’s
10:12
another one.
10:13
And then we have a parent education, teaching parent how to raise the
10:13
children in the country, and another one we have, the recreation - recreation
10:17
for the young people and family, and funding by the county, by United Way
10:22
and also support by Nike at that time.
10:25
So, and that’s some of the, the beginning that we have.
10:30
So, over the years, what were your positions with the AFC?
10:35
You were originally the coordinator and then over these last twenty years,
10:39
what have been some of your positions?
10:41
Yeah, I was the center coordinator, actually at that time, I was the center
10:48
coordinator for the, what they call.
10:48
And then there were,
10:51
other than
10:58
coordinator at that time there was Jeff, the director for, associate
11:04
director of the center, he’s in charge of development, but I’m in charge of
11:10
the management of our core programs.
11:16
So,
11:22
after that, the programs in 19…programs for parent-child
11:25
development service was start,
11:54
in 19, let me see, sorry.
11:57
[Pause] Oh yeah, the parent-child development start in—you can talk more
11:57
with Danita on that one, but I think it start in 19, let me see, 1997, parents,
12:01
add to the Asian Family Center, at the beginning was a few, and then they
12:06
expand to another immigrant group.
12:06
And then
12:12
another program, the health department, the tobacco prevention
12:16
start later on, and then comes another program, like emergency program,
12:23
diversity and leadership, you know.
12:27
So, it start from over three hundred thousand, now become over
12:33
three million budget program, or fifty, so Asian Family Center—and I
12:38
was the center coordinator up to 2004.
12:38
And then I retired, and then I came back.
12:39
When did
12:42
you come back?
12:42
One week after that [laughs] . And then when I come back, I assist Lee Po
12:44
Cha, who was director in implementing mainly the health program, and then
12:45
the tobacco prevention, and then the health program, and then came back and
12:54
then I
13:01
coordinate the
13:34
emergency program for three year, 2006, 2007 and 2008.
13:35
Emergency program, this is the one emergency program that after
13:36
I retired, I’m in charge, and I develop a program and the emergency
13:40
for three year, and then came with
13:46
the diversity and leadership program in 2008, so it’s all
13:52
in the past, and at that time
13:57
Polo was the director, and then Joseph and then Pei-ru.
14:04
Okay,
14:06
and so currently, what is your position?
14:08
So, what do you do right
14:11
now?
14:12
[laughs] Now, I am in two program: one is I’m the community organizer of the—I
14:23
was the, diversity and civic leadership project, what they call engagement.
14:27
We outreach to Asian community, my duty,
14:36
we recruit Asian community, and then we have a workshop, the training
14:41
program in the past six years we have trained over hundred-fifty
14:50
community leader and member, and after training we assist them to take a role
14:59
in city, county, commission, in the state, and also in their own community,
15:00
be it in their—you know in different community they have what they call
15:03
an MAA, Mutual Assistant leadership.
15:03
But also, our
15:15
graduate from diversity and leadership is become advisory board
15:20
member, become another different agency, so we had to work with them,
15:26
follow them, you know, feel for future – development of our community.
15:33
My second job is a business
15:39
development specialist, and business development specialist is
15:44
what they call microenterprise, I think 19…I think 2012.
15:54
Now it’s our fourth program.
15:56
We help recruit our business owner
16:02
and train them, we assist them on marketing, we assist them on
16:08
loan fund, if they need a loan fund, so in order that they can
16:16
grow their business and help their business.
16:18
For those people who want to start understand, we ask them to—actually I
16:25
was the business specialist for seven
16:33
years with Ford Foundation and before.
16:35
So, that’s about my duties.
16:37
For the engage project, and for the business development, is it all
16:41
ages, anyone in the community, or is it specific ages or, who are you
16:46
looking for, what types of people?
16:46
Well, I it’s all the business owner or they are owners but, and
16:51
also the leadership program, also
17:01
the community member.
17:04
Do people apply for these programs or do you recruit them, or both?
17:10
We, well the first duty as we develop the program, we have the
17:16
flyer, we outreach to the community.
17:20
Our outreach is, can be individual outreach, talk with them, get in touch
17:27
with the business, also, we also—our staff are coming from different
17:35
community; they can assist us on outreach also.
17:39
Our advisory board also, so if—some of them already know, you know, they call
17:47
them and they put them in the program.
17:51
Okay.
17:53
So, what do you see as your role within—as your role and
17:59
the AFC’s role within Oregon’s immigrant and refugee communities?
18:03
So programs like these, and assisting community members,
18:06
how do you see that functioning?
18:10
You know,
18:13
I think to me that I see the AFC as probably the big, most important role
18:22
play for IRCO’s growth and development.
18:26
You look at history, after the fall of Indochina, they set up here, in
18:37
1976, what they call an ICC, Indochinese Cultural Service Center, provide for the
18:46
Cambodian, Lao, and Vietnamese, that one.
18:51
And then, in
18:56
1983, they have under another program - mainly served the Indochinese, I mean
19:05
it was the, what they call Southeast Asian Refugee Federation, where the
19:12
Ford Foundation give money to Oregon, become the third in the nation to
19:20
develop refugee loan fund for business - you can see all these businesses.
19:25
So, in history actually, the Asian are the biggest and they play a role.
19:29
And then in 1984 they merged the two organizations, so the two organizations
19:29
is mainly to serve Asian community.
19:29
Now it
19:48
becomes International Refugee Center of Oregon, serve all refugee.
19:53
So, if you look at the history, the AFC, people
20:00
who at the beginning, it is people from Indochina.
20:07
Now, another role that AFC brings is in the program; you can look
20:13
at different program that we have.
20:19
Now, Asian Youth Leadership Program, funding by United Way, in 2000—no,
20:29
in 1993, was mainly for the Asian community when I was managing.
20:35
Now the youth activity is spread out throughout IRCO, and the Asian, the
20:39
program, there are many, many, many program by the AFC play a role for IRCO,
20:40
or is that…parent-child development service, start with the AFC here.
20:41
Mainly at that site and for the Asian family, Asian
20:41
community, you know, in 1997.
20:41
Now, now we serve for the Slavic here at IRCO, the African,
20:41
so it start from the AFC,
21:20
the program.
21:21
Even the SUN school, and you can talk with Fritz, now I think there
21:26
are about six SUN schools, and they’re in 2004.
21:30
It’s also started the program that started from the Asian Family and there are many
21:37
some other under the program at IRCO, I think the AFC, when we bring up the
21:43
Asian Family and then become the center,
21:47
that when we bought it, we have the big room, serve many things, or that
21:56
IRCO yeah, some programs, some people here, so that, you know, looking at
22:01
the budget, looking at the program, looking at how many they serve, so Asian
22:04
are the biggest, the Asian population.
22:04
But the
22:10
last one, the most important part that I see that AFC, very important
22:16
role for IRCO, bring IRCO visibility, credibility, reputation, all
22:20
of that and that, we start at the Asian, from Asian Cultural Night - we
22:27
bring on the funder, all the community leader member, all the mainstream, that
22:34
we have now, become, this year at the beginning, we set up the service and we
22:42
bring over five hundred people right now.
22:45
So that, the IRCO is - so that we make alone; reputation, credibility for IRCO.
22:53
I think that is the…
22:55
Great.
22:56
So, you’ve talked a lot about assisting the community and assessing the
23:01
community’s needs, how have you seen, over the years, over these last twenty or so
23:06
years, have you seen that the community’s needs have stayed the same in terms of
23:12
the types of programs you’re providing, or do you see that over the years you’ve
23:16
provided new programs and added new things based on what the community needs?
23:22
Well, I think that we are
23:25
so happy, we are proud of the changing; they are not the same as before.
23:29
We start with very, very small program, a few programs.
23:31
We start
23:35
with
23:38
the few funders, now they are, you know, our funding sources come
23:44
from state, county, city, you know.
23:47
And foundations and more money.
23:50
Now, because of the funding shows that to me, the need of our people, there are
23:56
more program, there are more—people are active in our community,
24:02
they assist their families, they assist their community, you know.
24:10
And also, there are many of other community now to our training, to our
24:19
support, become very active in community, in neighborhood, in city, county.
24:28
I think a lot of changing going in a good direction to become the,
24:35
you know, good citizens here and to get good community for you.
24:42
Well, let’s talk a little bit about some of the specific projects you’ve worked on.
24:48
So, I’m interested in learning more about the Asian Cultural Nights.
24:53
Those began in the mid-nineties and have had happened almost annually.
24:57
Can you talk a little bit about that annual event; how it began and what
25:02
it’s for, what types of things you do?
25:06
Well, that’s probably
25:10
one of the most important part playing in the Asian community and IRCO is
25:15
organizing the Asian Cultural Night.
25:19
Why is we celebrate that at the first, even in 1996, you know,
25:28
one year after—so the idea is to celebrate Asian Heritage Month.
25:40
May is Asian Heritage Month, so to celebrate the accomplishment of the Asian
25:47
community in the state of Oregon, and then also to celebrate our success, to raise
25:50
the visibility, the credibility of our
26:04
programs.
26:05
So that’s why our advisory board, our community, our staff started
26:12
Asian Cultural Night in May.
26:15
So, the first I—at the first one, we invite the governor, Kitzhaber at that
26:21
time, one of advisory board was a member of the Commission of Asian and I was a
26:21
member of the Commission on Asian Affairs.
26:21
So, we invite him to be keynote speaker.
26:21
By bringing the governor
26:48
to be
26:54
keynote speaker, at that time instead of five hundred, there were over seven
26:58
hundred people coming in through the door.
27:02
The community are very happy.
27:04
They have been here, they never see the governor.
27:08
And there
27:13
was so many people come to see him, and the TV, radio, so it’s boom!, then
27:19
everyone know Asian Family Center.
27:24
Beside that,
27:27
Asian Cultural Night is to raise
27:34
the visibility, but also the reputation, the good work that our
27:42
board, our staff have been doing, bring
27:47
the reputation, and then the idea is to bring on the community members,
27:54
community leader, part of that.
27:57
Five hundred people usually, two hundred community member, and also
28:02
best thing is we invite the funder on the funding sources and all the
28:07
mainstream services to work with.
28:10
So, if it’s very good
28:15
for, we have been doing very good.
28:18
And besides, the keynote speaker, each year we invite
28:23
a different keynote speaker.
28:26
I think that’s her second year or third year, or even Ron Wyden that one.
28:31
He is there in Washington D.C. He just flew from Washington, came back, become
28:36
the keynote hour speaker, because he is the one who had the idea to, in 1990, I
28:45
think, what they called Asian Task Force with Ron Wyden then they become our one
28:48
of milestones, and then the commissioner and key people, one each year.
28:48
So that I am happy about.
28:58
But, not only—another one,
29:04
you saw the program, the one that’s on, you know the program, different
29:04
program is so the community is all
29:14
the people.
29:16
In addition to that, what we call, that seeing the Asian Cultural Night
29:24
we have the traditional and then the dance, the show; there’s a show from
29:31
different country - you start from Cambodia, Lao, Hmong, Mien, India,
29:35
Malaysia, Japanese, Chinese, all the Asia.
29:40
So people like to see that one.
29:43
So at the end it’s a very, very success for me.
29:48
And do you take part in coordinating that over the years?
29:52
I start from the beginning and then you know, for the ten year that I was
29:58
center coordinator, I was main one, but each year we have the, each one advisory
30:05
board in the part, they are member, there are staff, they are part of committee.
30:09
We have the coordinator of the—even, usually my - I make all the planning and
30:09
we have a goal, we waited in the staff meeting for different community organize.
30:09
And over the
30:26
years, what was the location of the Asian Cultural Night?
30:30
Was it different each year?
30:34
You know, at the beginning we mostly, one of our Asian Cultural Night at we
30:46
call Legin Restaurant, and it is 82nd and Division from, and then the last few
30:53
year when the Legin and the PCC Portland Community College bought that one, become
31:00
the part of it, oh we don’t have any more.
31:04
So mostly, ninety percent of our evening at—and then one time we do
31:11
it at Holiday Inn at the airport and then last two year we did in what,
31:19
I think in downtown, in a hotel.
31:22
But,
31:24
most of them, a lot of them held at our—at Legin Restaurant.
31:30
At that time, not now.
31:33
Great.
31:34
We
31:37
started at, when we did two time at Holiday Inn, but our committee, they
31:45
really don’t like the way that—they want
31:58
to eat their—the food also, the Asian food, when they have that,
32:00
we even like to come culture to eat their Asian food, and then why
32:02
variety of our food is not so good.
32:06
Well, in terms of serving many different Asian communities, within the Asian
32:12
community there are many different cultures, many different languages,
32:16
what are some of the challenges of working with so many different cultures,
32:21
and how do you find the common themes among the different types of immigrants
32:26
and refugees that need assistance?
32:28
Asian
32:32
Pacific Islander is so diverse, so many different languages, so many
32:41
different countries, you know.
32:44
I think we as the staff have to learn, have to study each one of
32:52
them, not—well you see our staff here, almost twenty, speak twenty languages.
33:03
So the first thing is the staff that speak the language, know the culture,
33:10
know the way, how to communicate with them and deal with them,
33:14
that first most important to see.
33:18
You can see, start from even Sokho here, the Cambodian community, even you know,
33:21
it’s different from Laotian community.
33:21
The Lao also, you have to see, if say you’re going to go into the
33:23
Laotian community, you have to know.
33:24
If
33:29
you go to see
33:36
the Hmong community, you—and then the Hmong, they believe not only
33:43
the mutual assistant association leaders, as they understand our
33:45
leader, but also the clan leader.
33:48
They believe in a clan leader tradition, and I think the Mien also, have
33:54
similar to the Hmong clan leader, and
34:03
the Lao also different parts; southern part of Lao and have
34:04
the northern part of Lao.
34:04
I think the Vietnamese have more diversity - they are so diverse.
34:10
Beside that, they have different church and temple, the Buddhist, Catholic, so I
34:19
think in order to work with each community effectively, you have to know the people,
34:26
know their tradition, know the people.
34:29
And also, our—the information that we send; we send out a letter, we send out
34:35
a program with email, with all of that, but I think the most important part in my
34:42
almost thirty years working with all the community, is through the word of mouth,
34:48
through the person and one on one contact; this is the most important—effective
34:53
way, accept, actually mainly for the older people now, the people who
34:59
don’t read and ones who don’t speak.
35:03
If you don’t go to them individually, they—but for the
35:07
younger generation is different.
35:11
They know the American system; they know the technical, the modern technical, all
35:20
of that, but younger generation.
35:21
Now, another challenge that we have, to me, I work with the Lao community,
35:22
I am the leader in different part of it—formerly, I used to be the
35:23
Lao Buddhist president of the temple, and for over twenty years.
35:23
Now, used to be president of the Lao senior, and now the president of Lao
35:24
association for over twenty years, and one
35:49
of the thing that we’re still working on
35:55
what they call intergeneration gap.
35:58
Intergeneration, we used to have our program here at Asian Family
36:03
one time, now with there being a
36:12
younger generation and older generation, how—the younger generation has grown up
36:14
here, were born here, going to school here, but the parent want them to speak
36:25
their own language, and even in Lao community I see that.
36:29
We have to speak more language now.
36:32
English and our Lao language.
36:34
So that’s the challenge one, also, that I
36:39
can see.
36:41
So, you have to work with them in each community, usually
36:46
they have what they call
36:47
community lead—a mutual assistance association.
36:48
I think the Vietnamese have more.
36:48
I don’t—the
36:59
Lao had about seven mutual assistance association now.
37:03
The Hmong have—the Hmong American community and the Mien, I think are
37:08
another group the same way, but beside the mutual assistance association
37:15
is set up to support each other, to
37:22
work together, to help their community and also to have a
37:28
line in the mainstream service.
37:32
So, you work with a different—but in addition to the mutual assistance
37:39
association is also different of church
37:44
and temple.
37:46
And the Cambodian I think have Buddhist temple, the Lao have Buddhist
37:51
temple, the Vietnamese have different area, so we have to work with
38:01
all of that - different people.
38:02
Right.
38:04
So, the staff here at the AFC, they’re responsible for various programs
38:10
and then you have staff members who speak almost all, if not all of the
38:16
different languages within the Asian Pacific Islander community, correct?
38:20
So that you have someone who can work with someone if they don’t speak
38:24
English, you’ll have someone who can speak that language, is that the goal?
38:28
Well, that’s one of the goal, but we cannot hire all the, you know, all the—we
38:35
don’t have budget to hire very much, all the languages, but most of the, we have
38:38
most of the development, but the staff for the program that they have, working mostly
38:47
with their own,
38:52
but if, for example, I am Lao,
39:00
but the one—Sokho I have working, you know the Cambodian, but if you
39:08
have the clients, the parent, the children with Lao, he can interpret,
39:15
you know, so we support each other.
39:17
You know, even around the, even the board, advisory board.
39:21
So if we could not do it and then we call, we get in touch with those who speak their
39:30
own language, that way we work together.
39:33
That’s great.
39:33
So the staff within—and the advisory board within the AFC is
39:36
very supportive of one another.
39:37
Oh yeah, uh huh.
39:39
That’s wonderful.
39:41
So, let’s talk a little bit about the Coalition of Communities of Color
39:46
project and report, that’s something recent that occurred within the last
39:51
few years, doing research on the Asian Pacific Islander community, were
39:56
a part of that report in some way?
39:58
Can you talk a little bit about that?
40:00
I will talk a little bit, but I would like to leave that for you to interview
40:08
with Lee Po Cha, who is the director of Family Center, who is still, I think he
40:15
is the chair of that one, but you know, I can talk a little bit about that one
40:23
because I am one of the few who start, Lee and I were the—represent IRCO from
40:29
the beginnings, through the forming.
40:29
I think Thach also in the beginning.
40:29
We formed that with, at that time it’s only four community of color, I
40:29
think Asian, Hispanic, Native American and who is it…what they call, Native
40:29
American, and you know, we had four.
40:29
So, after, I think we form in—I
41:01
could not ever actually, in 2001 or 200- like that, and then
41:06
when—so Lee and I usually went to meeting almost every month at
41:16
that time, during the first year to form that, but in 19—in 2004 when the family
41:22
center system, after three year we are working on that, you know, and then
41:34
they were want to eliminate other family center, so except our board and
41:42
our IRCO board maintained Asian Family as a—but then no more longer eight
41:51
family center or eight family center with the mainstream, they become what
41:56
they call a school-based policy system.
42:00
So, the state wanted—
42:01
No, no, Multnomah County.
42:03
Oh, Multnomah County.
42:03
I mean they changed the system, not the same, the program.
42:04
They set them
42:07
as school-based policy.
42:10
I think, well when you talk with Lee he probably can talk more on that
42:17
one.
42:17
A school-based system policy like SUN school, all of that.
42:21
Our staff not only stay at our—here, but also based in the different
42:29
high school, different school.
42:31
So, after that we include, we had the funding,
42:51
acquired the funding, we include Slavic, we include…African refugee,
42:52
and I think become six now.
42:57
So, the goal is then to become the one that speak for,
43:05
work for our different community member together, because, mainly for the voice,
43:12
for the funding source, and to have different program for all minority group.
43:19
So that the, and the goal is
43:25
now is have bring—become a good
43:32
agency that can attract funding sources, like Sokho
43:39
is now working on what they call, an Asian
43:47
Leadership
43:50
Institute, this one is through the Meyer Memorial Trust funds.
43:54
You know, that’s all…and if its, so at that time also, because of the community
44:02
of color, all that minority get more funding from Multnomah County and Asian
44:09
Family, they also get more but mainly the African and Slavic, when they became
44:18
part of that too, we get more funding.
44:22
Okay.
44:23
So this was in the mid-2000s you said?
44:24
I think it’s 2001, that
44:29
I could not remember, actually.
44:31
It took about two years.
44:33
But after I retire in 2004, I worked there but not much, so that’s why I
44:40
would prefer to give you the talk more with Lee, because he is active on that.
44:46
Right.
44:49
Okay, well just a couple more things; so in terms of the types of projects
44:53
you work on, you work on, oh, AFC works a lot with youth and with seniors
44:59
and with, regarding health education.
45:02
Those, I see those as sort of some main topics.
45:05
What other types of things do you work on generally?
45:09
So, job training, business training, just in general what
45:14
other types of work does AFC do?
45:19
Well, beside the youth program, beside the parenting class, the family, the home,
45:27
we add on, we also what we call energy assistant; they provide energy support
45:36
for those from low-income families, it’s
45:40
ongoing, every year, that’s a development become popular one also.
45:46
Another one you can see is the information and reference service; you
45:51
support by—what else do I have…they have a youth program over here.
46:00
I think now they have more parenting and then the school, mentorship program.
46:11
Okay.
46:12
And do your services only provide assistance within Multnomah County,
46:18
or do they go beyond the county?
46:21
If someone needed help outside of the county, would you assist them or is
46:24
it mostly just for Multnomah county?
46:27
Well, it depend on the—most of it is you probably have to—in a program
46:35
that provide by—funding by Multnomah County, we provide for Multnomah County.
46:41
They are most of the program funding, by Multnomah County, and then the
46:46
programs is funding by city of Portland.
46:49
We have a few, city of Portland now funding.
46:52
But, if we had the state funding, some of them have funding and, you know, and
47:01
they are also foundation funding, there
47:06
are no limits, so they provide to—another area is, we have to go
47:09
along with the funding sources that we have, the guidelines, you know.
47:14
It’s not limit, but a majority are the Multnomah County, because Asian Family
47:19
Center start with Multnomah County funding and spending, and then you add
47:25
city, that area, and then you bring some of the state, now we have more from
47:30
foundation now, that helps, you know, you last another last question, you can talk
47:37
about what in the future will be of AFC.
47:40
It had been start from about 350,000, going up to over 3
47:50
million budget, and the staff start with three staff, me and my two staff,
47:57
and now we have over fifty staff in 19 years, and yeah, I think that’s
48:03
good, the stability of the AFC.
48:06
Great.
48:07
So, in closing, what recommendations do you have for AFC?
48:12
So moving forward towards the future, thinking about the work that you
48:17
can continue to do or new things that you can do, what are some
48:21
of your personal recommendations?
48:24
Well, that you know, working at AFC in
48:30
the last twenty year, seeing the AFC grow from a small one to the biggest one,
48:41
you know three that’s a part of all our
48:46
community, receiving all of the support from the city, county, different
48:53
funding sources, we are proud, actually
49:00
I am proud of it, I am proud of the growing, the stability of AFC,
49:07
you know, and I would just say that AFC is the one stop service
49:14
center, that what the idea, is one stop and then people can come here
49:19
to—at the beginning with a few program but there are many need.
49:28
The needs are so many and even we have
49:33
over fifty staff right now, it seems there’s more need.
49:37
So, I would like to see that we, AFC or Asian community, we continually
49:47
expand our program to meet the need of our community.
49:54
There are seeing so many need.
49:56
There are some community that we have to work with them and then another one
50:03
I think we—we should expand our advocacy efforts direct to city, county, state,
50:15
foundation, and also community, to get more additional funding to the meet,
50:27
even for example, economy development project now is only we can serve
50:33
particularly capacity to our community for the whole, not in general, it’s
50:38
only fifty—yeah, no, thirty businesses.
50:41
That’s not enough, I think.
50:44
When I was served seven years with the Ford Foundation and from 2000
50:50
and—from 1984 to 1990, for seven years was over 150 business that was a part.
50:59
Not it’s only we can—so we, we should advocate to look or get more funding.
51:05
Even the youth program, you know, the SUN school or—I
51:12
think another one that I would like to see expand more is the - to work
51:19
with - to coordinate working with our
51:25
- to bring up the community leadership, to be strong and unified, you
51:31
know, become the stronger, stronger the Asian community.
51:31
I’ll probably—we are
51:34
strong,
51:38
we are
51:41
stability, now we need to get more, because you know, ongoing
51:46
needs, ongoing programs, so we should work together in looking for
51:52
that, our future of our community.
51:55
Great.
51:57
So, is there anything that we have not discussed that you’d like to share, or
52:01
anything that you would like to share a little bit more, that we talked about?
52:04
Well, I have one thing that I am proud, I would like to see it coming,
52:13
and when we start up Asian Family Center, we have a small grant.
52:20
Each year we have 10,000 dollar, and in 2004 when
52:29
the economy is down, so the county stopped you know, that program, so they
52:36
can support only direct, indirect, small
52:45
grants got us the indirect funding, so that you know, so and during that period,
52:49
we provide over seventy-six small grant to our community, lending from five
52:57
hundred, the maximum is two thousand.
52:59
So, to all Multnomah community, they did it to give them a
53:07
way of support, become the seed the money, so they can have the train,
53:15
the traditional dancing, recreation,
53:19
any activity to support the community.
53:23
So I would like to see that in the future, maybe looking for
53:27
more funding for the small grant.
53:30
In order to build up, especially now we have trained over one hundred community
53:38
leaders, we should them, continually support them, seed incentive money to
53:44
them, and then they can support AFC or we can work together, because it’s such
53:53
a very good program, that one thing.
54:00
Another one, I’m—during my role
54:08
at the AFC, I have also said that I have, I was appointed by the
54:14
governor Kitzhaber for the three term, for seven year, and that become,
54:25
it’s good for the Asian community, it’s good for the Asian Family Center, become
54:29
part of that one and become reliability, and also the last one I would like to
54:36
say is that we’re happy that you are interviewing me today, because one
54:48
of additional role when working as the AFC center coordinator is I was
54:54
appointed by the president of Oregon State
55:05
University to be board of visitor for almost ten years, and then I make it out.
55:07
So, at that time I work with different, what they call?
55:13
The multicultural.
55:13
The cultural center?
55:13
Cultural center, they meet with the president, with the dean also, with
55:13
a student, so we would like to have a more Asian student in, not only a few,
55:13
that we have, that our recommendation.
55:13
We also would like the university to promote, to maintain the
55:13
professor of ours, so I’m happy that look, I was, almost every
55:13
month for six, seven year at OSU on
55:42
the advisory board so I am happy,
55:47
you know, to see
55:55
you, talk to you today.
55:57
That’s great.
55:58
Well, before we conclude, Sokho, since you’re here, did you want
56:01
to ask anything or follow up?
56:03
I’m good.
56:04
No?
56:04
Okay, so did we, we covered everything?
56:06
I don’t know whether I cover everything.
56:07
Yeah,
56:20
I think I covered everything.
56:21
Okay.
56:22
Well, well, we can add one more?
56:28
Come back to the leadership, diversity and civic leadership program.
56:34
You know, one of our goal beside training, the capacity, achieve for
56:38
them, is our role is the, to keep
56:41
them,
56:47
to work not only with the city of Portland but to work with
56:52
the neighborhood association.
56:54
That’s one of our goal, to work with community.
56:57
I think I am one of them, the first organizer but
57:05
also for other leadership, and right now I am very active on the East
57:11
Portland Action Plan that I made with them, and also economy development
57:17
community of East Portland Action, and also Asian community I’m happy to be
57:27
part of assist the city of Portland to redevelop The Portland Plan, you know, up
57:36
to.
57:37
But there are many other also, like I’d had been working with Slavic community
57:44
and Oleg have been working with Mohammed, so ask them, do you want to work more
57:49
and more to work with our graduates from diversity and to be more active in
57:56
their community and agency, that one I would hope our coordinate in the future.
57:56
We would like to work.
57:57
Okay, sounds good.
57:57
I hope I did
58:10
a good job [laughs]
58:13
. Alright, well thank you very much.
