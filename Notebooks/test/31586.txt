00:01
Today is December 12, 2017.
00:04
We’re at the Valley Library and I’m here with Dr. Dominique Bachelet, a
00:10
professor in the Department of Biological and Ecological Engineering Program.
00:15
Today we’re going to talk about your research as it relates to global
00:19
warming, but I’d like to start with your background: where were you born?
00:23
In Arras, France, north of Paris.
00:26
If you do a triangle between Brussels, London, and Paris my hometown is pretty
00:30
much in the middle of the triangle.
00:32
And that’s where you grew up?
00:34
Mm-hmm [yes]
00:35
. What was it like growing up there, growing up in France?
00:39
[Laughs] It was good food.
00:44
It’s a smallish town.
00:45
It’s about 100,000 people.
00:47
It’s in the middle of agricultural country.
00:50
I had one grandfather who was a blacksmith, for example.
00:53
One was an accountant in town.
00:57
North of my hometown ______ it was the old mine country, because the mines
01:04
were very deep they were about to close.
01:06
Only Polish people were able to or were gutsy enough to go and get the coal
01:11
out and so there were a lot of Polish enclaves in that area with a lot of fun
01:18
musical events and things like that, but also terrible accidents that happened
01:22
when I was a kid, too, so it was, you can tell it was the end of an era.
01:27
What did your parents did?
01:29
My mom was working in the telephone company, so putting the first digital
01:38
list of people who had phones, so that was kind of a fun era going digital.
01:45
France was the first one to have these little mini tele, which
01:50
were a little bit like the old Macs.
01:54
Little boxes with a screen and that was replacing the telephone
01:58
directory, so that was pretty neat.
02:01
That was in the ‘70s, yeah.
02:04
My dad started as a mechanic and became in charge of all the mechanics
02:10
in that local Citroën garage in town.
02:13
He was testing a lot of the new models on the freeway for the Citroën cars.
02:21
Nobody had gone to university.
02:24
I was the first in my family to do that.
02:25
I don’t have any siblings.
02:28
I was the one and only in my family.
02:32
What was your school experience like?
02:35
I went to Catholic school, two different schools in my hometown.
02:40
When I was 7 I went to the secondary school and was there
02:44
until I turned 17, all-girls school and with nuns teaching us.
02:51
There were non-nuns too, but very strict, hard-working, very much so.
02:58
We had the reputation of being really good, so we had to maintain that,
03:02
otherwise the nuns would descend upon us.
03:06
But it was a good time.
03:07
We were a good pack of friends, so it was good.
03:11
Did you have someone who guided you towards university?
03:15
Guided me to the university?
03:17
No, but it was pretty much a given that unless you wanted to do a vocational
03:22
thing like your parents you were pretty much going to the university next.
03:27
So, not really.
03:29
I had really good teachers, but I can’t say that anybody really
03:32
told me to go to the university.
03:33
I was really interested in science and I really wanted to do research, so I went.
03:43
You went to the university in Lille, is
03:48
that correct?
03:48
That’s correct, yeah.
03:49
It’s about a 30-minute train ride from my hometown.
03:53
I would take the train and go over there, and I rented an apartment in
03:57
town over there and yeah went to class every day and came back for the weekend.
04:03
How did you decide to study life science?
04:06
I’ve always been interested in science, from as little as I was insects and
04:12
worms I would bring all sorts of things home, to my mom’s dismay.
04:16
It was pretty obvious from the start that science was the way I was going to go.
04:20
I hesitated with medicine, because I was really interested
04:22
in immunology and surgery.
04:26
I used to open all sorts of mice on the tables, which was already
04:31
problematic for the people
04:36
_______ . Met a lot of people who were doing botany and that was the part of the
04:40
science that I knew the least about.
04:41
I had to write quite a bit about animals, so I thought, well, I should
04:45
learn more about plants, so I went into plant biology for my masters in Lille.
04:52
Why did you decide to pursue higher education?
04:56
Good question.
04:58
Let’s see?
04:59
Why did I do that?
05:01
Obviously, I hadn’t been doing any research when I was doing my masters,
05:04
because you don’t have the opportunity, but as soon as you start your Ph.D.
05:08
you’re given research projects, so I definitely wanted to do that.
05:12
I moved to Paris to do that, to Paris 11, which is the southern suburbs of Paris.
05:17
Met my advisor there who was just back from a stint with the International
05:24
Biological Program in Saskatchewan, and so he was working on grasslands and was
05:30
very interested in modeling and computer science and so we started working
05:34
together and at the time I was working on migratory grasshoppers from Africa and
05:40
how their swarming was determined by the water content of their food, and so did
05:48
a project with three species from Africa and used all sorts of techniques that
05:53
hadn’t been used on that sort of insect.
05:59
Anyway, went on with that for that for the first year.
06:01
It was a pretty small case of research in the lab and then wanted to do a model
06:08
and my advisor said if you really want to do a lot of computer science you should
06:13
finish it in the U.S. and not stay here.
06:15
And so, I packed up my bags and went to the University
06:21
of West Virginia, WVU, which was the cheapest university in
06:27
terms of tuition for foreign students at that U.S. at the time.
06:31
In August ’79 I arrived there with two suitcases and met Ann Bartuska, who was
06:37
doing her Ph.D. there and Ann went up in the stratosphere of the forest service,
06:43
which is always fun to see, a good friend.
06:47
She taught me how to get a card, a Social Security Card, how to
06:53
open a bank account and all that.
06:55
I stayed with her I think for a couple of weeks before I got my own apartment
06:58
and went on my feet and met my advisor, but he’s a person I had corresponded
07:05
to from France, and who was actually Ann’s major advisor and was looking
07:11
at decomposition in tropical forests.
07:15
Then met Bill Hunt, who was a young professor and was doing a lot of
07:19
simulation and so I was really interested in what he was doing, even though
07:24
he was from Texas and I had a heck of a time understanding his accent.
07:30
Started working more closely with him and talking about projects.
07:33
He was leaving.
07:34
I arrived in August in Morgantown and he was leaving the next June
07:40
for Fort Collins and asked me if I wanted to be on his project.
07:44
Of course, I agreed and moved to Colorado and then met another person, Jim Detling,
07:50
who had the project with typical research site at Pawnee Grasslands and studied
07:57
being his graduate assistant and so I had the double advisor and working
08:03
there on the role of grazing on the sort of blue grama grass, so all the
08:10
biogeochemical cycling in the short grass prairie Colorado and it was a lot of fun
08:17
working with all sorts of herbivores.
08:18
I was really interested in the plant-animal interactions.
08:21
The animals is where I had started, the plants I was still learning something
08:24
about but how the two interacted in terms of cycles was really of interest to me.
08:31
Climate was there first and foremost of course from the start.
08:39
Did you speak English before you came to the U.S. and how was it as a
08:42
researcher as non-native English speaker?
08:45
Yeah, so in France we learn English pretty quickly.
08:48
It’s our second language, or at least in Northern France it definitely is.
08:52
My mom was supposed to be an English teacher.
08:55
After World War II there were several soldiers who stayed at
08:58
my grandparents’ house, so she was pretty fluent in English, so
09:01
she always made me speak English.
09:04
We went to England several times.
09:06
I spent 3 summers in England and two summers in the U.S. before I moved
09:11
here, so I would say I was pretty good in English, nothing like I am now, but
09:18
I could understand English, I’d say.
09:21
Only the strong accent I had
09:26
problems with.
09:26
For a non-English speaker, there were ups and downs, but it was okay.
09:31
When I was in West Virginia I made money serving as a translator
09:35
for a group of African students for whom their first language was
09:41
French, so I was helping them.
09:42
They were doing a master’s in agriculture.
09:44
So, I was serving as their translator when they were there.
09:48
So that was fun.
09:50
But anyway, and also to make some extra money I did some translation
09:53
of abstracts for science papers and things like that at the time.
09:58
But to do research is like all the papers are written in English anyway,
10:01
so no matter what you need to at least read English if not speak it fluently.
10:07
In terms of computer modeling language, what were your—
10:10
At the time is was Fortran.
10:13
That was my second language for Colorado State University Ph.D. requirements.
10:17
It was pretty funny.
10:20
Did you enjoy learning that?
10:22
Oh, I love computers and programming at the time, yeah.
10:26
I’ve always liked math and so computers was just translating an equation
10:31
into a code and then running it many times, which was a lot of fun.
10:37
Did you teach while you were in Colorado?
10:39
Yeah, I was a TA for—I forget how many classes I was TA for.
10:45
Some introduction classes and in simulation modeling for Bill Hunt.
10:48
I was his TA for at least 2 semesters.
10:55
What was the cultural environment like at CSU with respect to
10:59
your environmental interests?
11:02
With respect to my environmental interests?
11:04
Well, it was great.
11:04
I mean, the Pawnee Grasslands were right there.
11:08
At the time the natural resource ecology lab was an old building
11:13
on campus that kind of brought people from different departments.
11:17
There was no ecology department.
11:18
There was nothing that was kind of like now that would be ecosystem
11:22
science, so the professors came from different departments: rangeland,
11:27
botany, and plant pathology.
11:28
I ended up getting my degree in botany and plant pathology just because that was the
11:33
easiest way, the way my two advisors were.
11:39
We were a bunch of young grad students.
11:41
There was Dave Schimmel, Beth Holland,
11:46
Jill Baron, Dennis Ojima.
11:50
We all share in the same rooms.
11:52
It was pretty tight.
11:53
When Beth was opening her drawer in her desk, I had to move into my desk,
11:57
so she could get things out of the drawer, but we had great interactions
12:04
between the professors and the students.
12:08
Professors there was Bill Parton and Dave Coleman, so every week we had a brown
12:15
bagger where the students would give 10, 15-minute presentations and there
12:20
were two students and one professor who would prepare something for 30 minutes.
12:24
We had an hour brown bagger to share the science that was being done there.
12:29
I was very dynamic.
12:31
I think the professors were all pretty young, except, well, Dave Coleman
12:34
was not so young anymore, but still.
12:36
It
12:38
was very, very active.
12:40
A lot of really good relationships between students and professors, very
12:45
ongoing all the time and then Friday afternoons there was always a social.
12:51
We had really easy access to the professors doing research,
12:54
so that was really valuable.
12:58
Then you stayed in the U.S. when you were done with your Ph.D.?
13:01
Yeah, so just before I finished I did my defense I went back to France to
13:08
take an exam, the national exam, because my professor in Paris really wanted
13:12
me to come back and work with him.
13:15
It’s a national exam.
13:16
Even now, it’s pretty limited the number of people who are picked.
13:19
The year I took the exam they were picking one person and I finished second, so
13:24
it was like [mouth noise] . So, I went back and did my defense and then moved
13:29
to Thailand for 4 months and then was teaching computer science over there
13:34
and then I applied for postdocs and got two offers and so I went to California.
13:42
The two offers were in California, so that was easy in terms
13:44
of location but picked one.
13:46
Called my advisor in Colorado and said okay, who should I go work for?
13:50
Who’s the best person?
13:51
Who does the best science?
13:52
So that’s who I picked.
13:56
That was desert and ecosystem modeling?
13:58
Yeah, with Wes Jarrell in Riverside, California at UCR.
14:02
I was there for a couple of years working on the nitrogen fixers and mesquite trees
14:10
in Sonoran Desert looking at how is the coupling between the nitrogen fixation at
14:18
the bottom next to the phreatic zone where the mesquite has very deep roots that hits
14:23
the phreatic zone, so the groundwater.
14:26
Then there’s rhizobium nodule next to the water so it’s a very moist zone, picks
14:30
up the nitrogen, natural, I mean gases, nitrogen and moves that into the tissues
14:36
of the plant and the leaves become really high in nitrogen, they fall on the ground
14:40
and there’s accumulation of nitrogen underneath a canopy until there’s a rain.
14:45
Then the fine roots which are dormant during dry times come to life and
14:50
start dealing with the nitrogen that’s going to be leeching from
14:53
the dead leaves underneath the tree.
14:54
But there’s a _____ between their low root system, moist root system,
15:00
and their very dry upper canopy.
15:04
The leaves are so rich in nitrogen that you have a lot of insects that go
15:08
and pick up the moisture and nitrogen that are in the leaves and you can
15:14
be sitting under a mesquite in the middle of a very hot summer and it’s
15:17
going to be raining sugar because the insects are going to pick those leaves.
15:22
It’s a very interesting thing.
15:24
We were in a pretty neat team and we were walking, we worked in Palm Springs
15:29
and found some of the first nodules.
15:32
There was an ____ and so all the floods that was during the monsoon had carved
15:38
out really steep bank and you could see the roots of mesquite and we found
15:43
nodules very, very deep—they were 6 meters deep or something like that.
15:49
We knew that they were there, but we had no real data, so we actually found
15:52
them, which was really interesting.
15:56
Then you went to Man Tech Environmental?
15:59
No, First I went to New Mexico State.
16:04
Because I was working on the nitrogen fixing model.
16:07
Jim Reynolds who was working—I moved to New Mexico State University was in the
16:14
process of putting together a desert model, so I went over there and worked
16:17
2 years over there and worked with Pete Virega, who was a soil scientist,
16:21
now retired, at New Mexico State.
16:23
So, I spent two years there.
16:25
Then I applied for a job with Man Tech in Corvallis at the EPA lab.
16:30
That’s where I started working on UV-B impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.
16:39
So, I started there September ’88 and the Montreal Protocol was
16:42
signed pretty much immediately so we got a phone call from Washington,
16:46
D.C., saying okay forget ozone.
16:49
We got that under control but this climate change thing, can
16:52
you switch to climate change?
16:54
It’s like, okay, we’ll switch to climate change.
16:57
Then of course they told me well, we’re not going to do terrestrial ecosystem
17:01
we’re going to do rice patties in Asia.
17:05
Welcome to the EPA.
17:09
It’s just like suddenly the project theme had changed dramatically,
17:12
but in their mind, I was a grass line ecologist, and rice being a
17:16
grass I was right in my expertise.
17:21
So, worked with that project until ’94.
17:25
Traveled to Asia quite a bit to meet with everybody doing all sorts of experiments.
17:30
The main fieldwork was done in the Philippines.
17:33
We had growth chambers and methane emission chambers.
17:37
Methane part of the project was pretty much instrumented
17:44
and analyzed by a German group and then all the simulation modeling
17:49
that I was working on was also led by Dutch people who had a
17:55
whole suite of agriculture models.
17:58
I was interested in putting an ecosystem model together.
18:00
They were interested in the crop and yield part, so it was a good association.
18:05
Then all sorts of CO2 chambers and it was—oh, I see his face and I can’t
18:11
remember his name, who did all the CO2 work at the Institute of Rice
18:15
Research in the Philippines, but
18:20
we worked with people in China, people in Japan, people in Vietnam
18:25
and then a few scientists here in the U.S. It was a big project.
18:31
How did you feel about working in an agricultural—?
18:34
It was fun.
18:35
Yeah, there’s a lot more data for Ag than it is for natural
18:39
systems, so it was great.
18:40
There was lots of numbers to play with, to do the model with.
18:46
We tried four different models.
18:48
It was a good team with lots of interacting people, so it was a really
18:53
good learning experience and then of course at the end when we wrote the
18:57
final report we gave all the data to an economist who pretty much told us
19:02
that the biology, yeah, sure but what’s the most important thing in terms of
19:07
the future of rice was the price of rice on world markets, and of course
19:12
the social unrest or peace in the countries that produce the most rice.
19:18
That was kind of a sobering thought, but logical.
19:29
What did you think of Corvallis when you arrived here?
19:32
I thought it was a very small town.
19:36
I was used to more I’d say entertainment possibility—I love
19:41
theater and so does my husband.
19:43
We used to go to the theater in Las Cruces, even though it’s a small town
19:48
too, they had a top-notch theater.
19:51
It was a little disappointing coming to Corvallis.
19:54
The theater scene was pretty poor at the time, but the folk scene was pretty neat.
19:59
We pretty much got into the Corvallis Folklore Society, attended
20:03
a lot of their music events.
20:05
We learned a lot about folk singing and folk singers, I should say, but
20:10
anyway it was nice to be able to go to Portland and enjoy the big city.
20:16
But we love the outdoors, so that was good to be close to the
20:20
ocean and close to mountains.
20:22
Of course, it rains a lot so that was after New Mexico and
20:26
California it was really tough to get used to these 9 months of rain.
20:32
That’s always been the down side of Corvallis.
20:38
But very small community.
20:40
Everybody
20:43
knows everybody, so it’s kind of interesting.
20:48
You transitioned to OSU from Man Tech?
20:53
Correct, across the street, yeah.
20:55
What did you think about that transition returning to academia?
20:59
Well, it didn’t make much difference, because I mean it’s
21:01
not like OSU paid my salary.
21:04
I was still on the research project, so what happened was Ryan Neilson was
21:09
working on the EPA and he was looking at climate change, but on terrestrial
21:15
systems, on natural systems, and so I had already worked on the climate
21:20
change models and projections for the rice project, and he was looking at
21:27
climate trends and so he was working with this student Chris Daly at the
21:31
time was designing PRISM at the time.
21:34
Jim Lenihan was a bioclimatologist and so he asked me if I was
21:38
interested in putting together the biogeochemical part of the equation.
21:43
I said sure if you don’t mind _______ . I know _____ which
21:46
was what I had my Ph.D. with.
21:49
The three of us—Jim, Chris, and I—sat down and started designing a model
21:53
that could actually look at climate impacts from a climate perspective
21:58
by the evolution perspective with Jim and soon after with fire.
22:05
So, Jim took Linehan took over the fire bit.
22:08
For me it wasn’t a very big difference, except EPA of course has a lot more
22:12
administrative BS going with it so it was a lot lighter to be at OSU.
22:17
It has its own, but EPA had been transitioning.
22:21
There had been a big shift in their administration, so we had a few waves
22:26
to float over at the time, which were not the most, the most easiest ones to
22:32
deal with but times change and anyway.
22:36
But for me in terms of research I was continuing doing things I liked
22:40
to do, being with a computer and data analysis and equations and yeah
22:45
it was a pretty smooth transition.
22:48
Was the model that you were referring to was that the MC1 Vegetation Model?
22:53
Yeah, MC1, yep.
22:54
My husband got a job in New Hampshire for a year replacing
22:58
somebody and teaching over there.
23:01
I moved over there and worked in John Aber’s lab for a year.
23:04
That was really, really cool to be on the east side and working a bit for
23:08
the folks from the Marion Biological Lab at Woods Hole, and they were
23:12
developing their own model there.
23:15
The east coast influence and what they were doing, and John had a really
23:20
good Ph.D. student, Scott Oliver, who actually took over John’s lab when
23:28
he retired and was very interested in nitrogen and had put together
23:33
a really nice model with John.
23:35
It was interesting to see different aspects of approaching the impacts of
23:39
climate change on terrestrial systems, especially in the east coast forest,
23:43
which I didn’t know too much about.
23:44
I only looked pretty much like on the other side of the Atlantic.
23:49
I’m more familiar with what we have here.
23:54
So, going back to your arrival at OSU, you started out in the
23:59
department of bioresource engineering?
24:01
Ag Engineering at the time.
24:03
Okay.
24:03
It was Agricultural Engineering.
24:05
What was the culture of that program like at that time?
24:09
Has it shifted?
24:12
At the time I was working on rice, so I fit pretty right in.
24:16
Was working with a few people really interested in crops, but the
24:22
department has also been very varied.
24:25
So, you have people with different backgrounds and different interests,
24:28
so it’s always been pretty interesting to see everybody’s vision of a
24:33
particular problem, because you get very different perspectives.
24:37
It’s a great department head and people are very friendly
24:41
and inclusive, so it was nice.
24:45
I never had an office there, mind you.
24:47
My office was in the forestry sciences lab because I was working with
24:50
Neilson and his team, so they had an office space for me over there.
24:54
Is that the Conservation Biology Institute?
24:56
That was separate.
24:56
No.
24:56
The forestry sciences lab on Jefferson Street, where the
25:00
forest service folks are.
25:01
Right.
25:06
Were you teaching when you arrived or just researching?
25:10
When you first arrived at OSU?
25:11
When I first arrived, I taught one class of global ecology with a colleague from
25:15
EPA, Hermann Gucinski, who moved to forest service afterwards and Dave Turner.
25:21
The three of us took one class.
25:25
Then I taught a few classes for the BEE.
25:27
I taught proposal writing and then giving speeches and
25:35
things like that, presentations.
25:37
Those were required classes in the department at the
25:39
time, so I taught those two.
25:44
When did you get involved with Conservation Biology Institute?
25:46
That was in 2009.
25:49
I first went to the Nature Conservancy in 2007, so I left Ron Neilson’s
25:53
team in 2006 and then I joined TNC in 2007, spent a year and a half with
26:00
them, realized quickly they were not interested in supporting science.
26:05
They were interested in outreach and other young businesses, and so I left there to
26:12
continue doing science and research and then I talked to James Strittholt who was
26:17
apparently interested in having me come over and do modeling and climate change.
26:21
CBI did not have climate change research before that, and they had just received
26:26
a grant from the Cressey Foundation to put together a climate center, an online
26:31
climate center, so Jim paid half of my salary the first year to work on that.
26:37
You were affiliated with OSU throughout that whole time?
26:39
Yeah, sure.
26:41
Yep, same department.
26:42
Changed names a couple times.
26:46
You worked on the data basin component as well?
26:49
The data basin as this climate center, so we created the climate center
26:53
within the data basin, so yeah.
26:57
Can you talk about the importance of that in accruing data from I guess across—?
27:05
It’s a pretty lofty goal.
27:06
It’s to be able to centralize spatial data sets that are relevant to people
27:12
who do conservation, mostly, but also anybody who is interested in looking
27:16
at what’s out there and so when it started it really was one of the
27:22
first ones to make all these data sets available with good documentation.
27:26
The goal was also to create a network, so that if you were interested in a
27:30
particular data set, the name of the person who had created the data is
27:33
available and you can contact that person and then you can start interacting.
27:39
The even loftier goal way back when was we were going to have a review panel of
27:45
experts who would actually look at every single new data set coming into data
27:49
basin and give an evaluation, just like when you submit a paper to a journal.
27:56
Unfortunately, that never came to pass, but we put together a couple of groups
28:00
that were supposed to keep an eye on the content of those special data sets
28:05
and not only their relevance but also doing a good QA/QC of value of the data.
28:14
But the data basin separates the special data sets that have been
28:18
published versus those that are not.
28:20
So that gives a clue that some of them have never been checked by peers, but
28:25
that doesn’t mean they’re not useful.
28:26
It would have been nice to have this panel of experts to actually check and comment
28:33
on new data sets but given the fact that at the beginning it was just like pouring
28:37
in, it would have been a tough job.
28:39
But anyway, somebody should have done that.
28:42
Should
28:47
have.
28:48
You also got involved with an intergovernmental panel on climate change?
28:52
Involved.
28:54
Yeah.
28:54
Well, when I was working on rice they asked me to be a coauthor
28:57
on one of the chapters, because our rice models were producing a
29:02
bunch of climate change impacts.
29:05
Cynthia Rosenzweig was doing her work, she was gone.
29:09
She was doing her Ph.D. at the time, so we were the other team working
29:14
on climate change impacts on crops.
29:16
Of course, our crop was just rice.
29:18
She was doing all the other crops wheat and things like that, so she was I believe
29:22
first-named author at the time on the Ag, or somebody working with her, on the
29:26
Ag sector, and so because I was working on that I was coauthor on the chapter.
29:32
Then I volunteered to be reviewers on the next one.
29:36
The first one that I participated in was ’95 and then the rest was recently,
29:42
including the one that we had the Nobel Peace Prize for it, that so
29:47
many people were excited about, even though there’s about 3,000 of us that
29:51
got the prize for that piece of work.
29:58
Do you anticipate continuing to be involved with future—?
30:02
Oh, sure.
30:03
I mean, as far as I still understand what’s being done, yes.
30:08
Sure.
30:09
But this year I focused on the SOCCR report rather than the IPCC report,
30:13
but the IPCC’s coming up anyway.
30:16
I’m always the reviewer, usually, on the terrestrial impacts and
30:20
for the North American chapter.
30:22
Do
30:26
you return to France a couple times, it looks like, as a visiting scientist?
30:32
Oh, yes.
30:33
That’s right.
30:35
I went to Phillipe Ciais’s lab in Paris.
30:39
Phillipe is one of the lead global modelers,
30:44
only publishes in Nature and Science, so that tells you what level he is.
30:48
But super nice guy.
30:49
He asked me if I was interested in coming and working with him on the fire model
30:53
for their dynamic global vegetation model, which is of _____ , and so I
30:59
spent a few months there, three months I think in Paris working with him and then
31:04
what Steve when was doing his postdoc in Toulouse, I was working on a Mediterranean
31:10
model, using actually John Aber’s model.
31:15
Did you ever consider returning to France?
31:17
Oh, yes.
31:18
Especially this year, to be honest.
31:22
Yes.
31:23
I actually still have an email in my inbox, because the French government is
31:27
offering grants for people to go back, so I have an email that says okay when
31:32
do you want to come and for how long?
31:35
I have to deal with that.
31:36
They’re trying to recruit their academics back?
31:38
Yeah, well, if you want to do climate change, they say, you know you can do
31:41
it in France since you can’t do it here.
31:43
Given the fact that all my contacts have told me that they can’t do climate change
31:46
research anymore, it’s like if I want to continue doing what I’ve been doing for
31:49
the last 25 years, I better go somewhere that will let me and fund my research.
32:00
How have your modeling tools changed through your career,
32:04
in terms of coding language?
32:07
Yeah, coding language has evolved tremendously for sure.
32:11
We started with I think it was Fortran III or Fortran IV
32:14
and we are now at Fortran XC?
32:19
It’s still in Fortran but it’s a very different beast from what it was.
32:24
We didn’t have objector-oriented programming at the time,
32:27
so C++ was unknown.
32:29
That has changed quite a bit.
32:30
I remember when I did my Ph.D. I had a deck of cards.
32:35
Because I was a student, we used to do batch jobs in the evening and so we’d
32:40
give the deck of cards to the people at the computer center and you’d go
32:44
back in the morning and you’d have the accordion pages of paper with all the
32:49
results from your model and if you have mistyped a number you could start again
32:54
[laughs] . It was a very slow process.
32:58
Things have dramatically changed,
33:03
which is great.
33:09
You look at a lot of carbon or nutrient cycling through systems.
33:15
How do you incorporate that with vegetation modeling?
33:19
We grow plants and as they grow they accumulate carbon.
33:24
For every atom of carbon there is an associated number of nutrient atoms
33:32
and we’ve been focusing on nitrogen but that’s one of also other of the
33:39
things that are missing in our model.
33:40
We’ve never been able to really calibrate it with real data for the
33:45
nitrogen cycle, the full nitrogen cycle.
33:49
It would be nice if we had global data sets, especially time series of
33:54
nitrogen disposition, nitrogen fixation.
33:56
Those numbers are very difficult to find.
33:58
Deposition you can find because it’s associated with pollution but
34:04
it’s not a very long time series.
34:06
You have to make assumptions.
34:07
We started our models in 1895 and we go to 2100, so there’s a period in the
34:13
past that we don’t have anything about.
34:14
We can make some assumptions but in the future it’s really difficult to
34:19
go that way and really be realistic or believable when you assume a particular
34:25
amount of nitrogen deposition, the pollution level’s difficult to tell.
34:30
It depends on what’s going to happen on the policy level.
34:34
These seem to be changing every 8 years or so, so it’s difficult
34:39
to tell what comes next.
34:42
Anyway, so our model is fully, you
34:47
have vegetation types, we have all the carbon pools and then we have fire that
34:52
modifies the carbon pools and if you change the canopy and the cover you change
34:57
the type of vegetation that is there.
34:59
In other words, we have
35:03
succession after a fire.
35:08
How did your research go back into natural systems and away from
35:12
agricultural systems of rice fields?
35:16
Just, you know when I was doing my graduate study I was looking at grassland,
35:22
native grasslands, short grass prairie.
35:25
It was a matter of learning about how forests grow, and I was in Neilson’s
35:30
team and we just put it together.
35:33
A plant is a plant.
35:34
I know a woody plant from an herbaceous plant, but overall those
35:38
are pretty standard processes.
35:41
If you do any studies in biology, you always learn about these things.
35:45
It’s just a matter of putting it together.
35:48
What are the difficulties associated with modeling, say a natural landscape
35:52
versus an agricultural system?
35:55
Well, an Ag system especially when you do a crop, you plant it, so you
36:00
know when it starts and then you harvest it and you know when it ends.
36:04
Natural systems they grow throughout.
36:07
If you live in Oregon you know perfectly well there’s photosynthesis
36:11
happening in the winter, so you can’t just say in the winter everything
36:14
is dormant nothing happens.
36:15
There are things that are happening.
36:16
The roots are changing.
36:19
People have been monitoring plants, but you always miss something.
36:25
There’s always something you’re not 100% sure about.
36:27
For example, plants have roots and roots exude material but the exudation rate
36:32
from roots is very difficult to measure.
36:35
You can measure it in a lab but it’s not the same as when
36:40
it’s in the soil in real life.
36:44
So, you have this number that you think is an approximately correct.
36:48
You look at the literature.
36:49
You see people who have measured it.
36:51
You can find a few papers, specifically old ones because now it’s very a fine few
36:56
people who want to do that sort of thing.
36:59
If your model fails, you don’t know if that number was wrong and so if you
37:03
can turn that one off it’s something else in your model that you have the
37:07
wrong number for or the wrong process.
37:09
You forgot something.
37:11
The challenge is to really understand the processes and natural systems, because
37:15
they’re the ones that everybody looks at.
37:16
Like photosynthesis, the ________, there are millions of articles about how
37:20
to put together an equation for photosynthesis, but if you stop
37:24
looking at root growth, turnover,
37:28
exudation, those are pretty rare, especially reliable
37:31
papers because it’s hard work.
37:35
There’s nothing easy and the techniques always have flaws and limitations.
37:40
In the old days, in the ‘20s, there were professors who had grad students
37:45
who dug up roots and with carefully with paint brush separated all the
37:50
fine roots to look at cloud of all those roots for a particular plant.
37:55
That’s the kind of thing that nobody will do any more.
37:57
Lidar is supposed to help but it’s not quite the same.
38:04
I’m hoping that the new satellite imagery, but maybe not satellite,
38:08
but the visualization things that can be done from airplanes or
38:13
drones can actually be designed.
38:16
Maybe in 20 years we’d have really good tools to have the level of details
38:20
that will help us understand—maybe not put all the details in the model
38:23
but understand the processes that we might be missing, especially since
38:27
everything is changing these days.
38:30
Everything we’ve known based on what we’ve observed in the 20th century
38:33
needs to be revised, seriously.
38:36
So, lots to do.
38:40
How do you incorporate human decisions on the landscapes.
38:43
Ah, that’s the fun part.
38:47
We just started working with our model with land use a few years ago.
38:51
We had a big project with the USGS and they wanted us to use land use.
38:57
The problem with land use is you can look at an image and it tells
39:00
you where the fields are, where the plantations versus natural forest are.
39:05
But to know how they’re managed, what you need to put in the model: it’s like have
39:10
they been thinned, in terms of forest?
39:13
If they were replanted, were they seeded or was it seedlings and was
39:17
there herbicide, how did that affect the plants that were around it?
39:22
For grasslands, it’s the same.
39:24
Was there prescribed burning?
39:25
How many heads of cattle were there?
39:27
How much of the native ungulates came and grazed with everything else?
39:31
What was the population of
39:35
nematodes or you know root weasels... there’s a lot of things going on.
39:38
Biology’s very complex.
39:39
You’re always going to miss something.
39:41
Of course, the model is not there to represent reality.
39:44
It’s to synthesize the knowledge you have and see if you really
39:48
understand how the processes work.
39:49
If the model doesn’t work, then it’s interesting because
39:52
then you need to dig deeper.
39:53
The problem these days is everybody believes models.
39:59
They’re great tools, and they’re made to stretch your mind.
40:01
The problem is a lot of people are doing these ________ . They’re
40:05
supposed to give you the means to look beyond what your eyes can see.
40:15
Do you find it easier to incorporate fire, natural disturbance, into a
40:18
model compared to say human impact?
40:23
Is it similar?
40:24
I wouldn’t say that.
40:26
Again, if we put agricultural land use, we can actually have calendars of
40:33
crops and we know what crops are going to be planted and things like that.
40:37
At least in the past we had a pretty good idea.
40:39
In the future, it’s total guesswork.
40:41
Obviously, we don’t know anything.
40:43
We don’t have a clue what’s going to happen 20 years from now, what’s going
40:45
to be growing in the Willamette Valley.
40:47
Lots of people have ideas but we don’t know, especially if California has
40:50
a drought they won’t be able to grow any of their fruit and vegetables.
40:55
In terms of wildfires, our fire was the first one that was designed to be dynamic.
41:00
We grow the plant, we grow the pools of carbon.
41:03
We have thresholds of how much fuel there is alive and dead and how moist they are.
41:07
Then we determine the severity of the fire.
41:12
In the future, it will depend a lot on the response of plants to CO2, which
41:16
for some species there’s been enough experiments that we have an idea of
41:21
how that’s going to be responding.
41:22
For others, we don’t have a clue, because we’ve never done the experiment.
41:26
The experiments have been done on a limited number of species.
41:33
Lots of unknowns still on the response to that and of course population density’s
41:39
increasing, so the number of fire ignitions, the timing of the ignitions
41:45
and the location of the ignitions by humans are totally unpredictable.
41:52
Natural fires we know that there’s a season when it’s warm and dry that’s where
41:56
you might get lightening, you can pretty much, there’s good correlations there.
41:59
When it’s a person who makes a fire in the middle of an area where lightning
42:05
cannot reach or whatever and in the middle of a season where things are
42:08
still fairly green but there’s a wind but suddenly the fire will carry.
42:12
We
42:14
can’t predict that.
42:15
In California, the majority of fire are human-started, so it’s really
42:19
difficult to simulate the future of that.
42:22
When Oregon triples its population in 20 years, what’s going to happen?
42:26
Where are the people going?
42:27
Are they going to be smoking in the forests on the coast range?
42:31
Things like that.
42:34
But with the warmer, dryer conditions as projected for the future, I think
42:40
where you’re going to have people there’s going to be a higher fire risk.
42:43
On a global basis, we just published a paper with a bunch of young,
42:47
European students who dedicated their life to document all the
42:52
fire models that are being used.
42:55
We showed that globally, the trend for future fire is down, because there’s more
42:59
urban area, there’s more Ag lands, so less likely possibilities to have fires.
43:04
Of course, the natural land getting warmer and dryer will burn, that’s what
43:07
we’re seeing this year, but it’s just in general more people means it would end up
43:16
being more destroying the natural lands and so admitting the fire risk there.
43:24
Different types of fires.
43:28
How has working with land management agencies influenced
43:31
your research directions?
43:32
Is it primary with funding, because you also do training on using models, right?
43:39
When I joined the Nature Conservancy and then Conservation Biology
43:43
Institute, my goal was really to improve the science communication.
43:47
Because I worked on models, we published the IPCC reports, but the
43:50
managers don’t have time to read.
43:52
They don’t have time to listen to our presentation.
43:55
We use jargon that they don’t get, which I totally understand.
44:00
Especially when I joined TNC that was really, I was hoping to stay a
44:03
lot longer and really work with these people, because they’re the largest
44:06
private landowner in the world.
44:08
Their ownership is just tremendous.
44:11
If you wanted to really interact with people working on the ground,
44:14
this was a good place to be.
44:16
Turns out, it wasn’t, but anyway, at CBI we designed several web tools to actually
44:22
provide the data to the managers hoping that they could use it in their reports.
44:27
Until last year, they could, now it seems very jeopardized.
44:30
I
44:32
worked for forest service people.
44:35
I worked with BLM.
44:35
The forest service is an interesting entity, because they have a research
44:38
branch and a management branch, so you’re pretty much a fifth wheel as a
44:43
researcher coming in the project for the forest service, because they’ve got
44:46
really experts in their research branch, so it’s a little harder to work with
44:50
the managers for the forest service.
44:52
BLM doesn’t have a research grant and it’s been a joy to work with BLM managers who
44:56
are really eager to get the information.
44:59
Super busy people.
45:01
Lots of land, few people to manage this and so very eager to get the information
45:05
from you and get something they can use to improve or just be aware of what
45:11
might be happening soon to their land.
45:15
Worked with the park service.
45:16
Park service works very closely with the USGS, of course.
45:19
USGS
45:22
have some of the best scientists in natural resource management, and so
45:28
it’s really great to work with the USGS people, especially if you find
45:31
a group that kind of meshes with you and we don’t step on any toes, but
45:35
you actually complement each other.
45:37
That’s happened in a couple of projects.
45:39
That was really cool.
45:41
The funding is, of course, depends on what agency you work with.
45:47
It’s been great to work with these people.
45:50
Now it’s getting tougher this year.
45:51
The problem with NSF is
45:54
when you get a grant or some of the grants they don’t want an application.
45:59
I’m very interested in application because I’ve been doing science
46:03
most of my life and science doesn’t getting applied easily.
46:06
It gets misinterpreted and it’s really extremely frustrating after working
46:11
for 25 years in climate change to see how misinterpreted the work of
46:15
all these climate models is just—they work so hard and they try to do such
46:21
a good job and those are fantastic tools and they are really being given
46:28
too much negative advertisement.
46:34
So, from your work with these different land management agencies, particularly
46:39
in the Pacific Northwest, have you formed your own ideas about how
46:44
land could be managed in the future with respect to climate change?
46:47
I’m not a manager.
46:49
I could tell people what to do, but it wouldn’t make much sense.
46:54
Managers know their land.
46:56
I can bring what I know about the processes that I understand,
47:00
and I can show them what the data explains or their limitation of the
47:07
data sets that we’re providing, so they can make their own opinion.
47:11
We learn from them quite a bit.
47:13
They have constraints.
47:14
They have constraints of the amount of funding they have to do the
47:19
things they have to do on their land.
47:21
They have constraints in terms of the number of people
47:23
available to apply whatever techniques they decide to go with.
47:28
Even if they know what to do by listening to our stories, saying oh this is relevant
47:32
to what I would like to do on my land.
47:34
But if they don’t have the resources they can just provide a sheet to their
47:40
supervisor saying well, given this, we would love to be able to do this
47:44
particular treatment, but they may or may not get the resources to do
47:50
it.
47:51
In general, I never tell people what to do on their land.
47:53
I know what to do in my garden, that’s bad enough
47:59
[laughs]
47:59
. I have a final set of questions related to climate change, but I did want to
48:03
ask you about your water color art.
48:07
You’re an artist as well.
48:11
Is that something you’ve been doing your whole life?
48:12
Yes, pretty much.
48:14
Water color, maybe not, but drawing.
48:15
My dad was a very good artist and my great grandfather was an
48:23
artist, a true artist, but anyway.
48:26
That was a turn of the century of the 20th century.
48:30
It’s very relaxing and it’s something that flushes my brain out.
48:34
I don’t think about anything else when I do that.
48:36
It’s very enjoyable.
48:37
It’s quick.
48:39
A lot of people
48:43
are afraid of watercolor because there’s a lot of looseness and when you work
48:46
with water you can have surprises.
48:50
It doesn’t really matter to me.
48:52
I love to play with water, but it’s really fun to see what happens.
48:56
It’s a little bit like a natural system.
48:58
So, you put water and colors together and see the blending and things like that and
49:03
you always get something that’s different from where you think you were going to.
49:08
It’s always exciting to see the results, but yeah for me it’s
49:11
just I need it for sanity’s sake.
49:16
Different kind of modeling.
49:17
Different kind of modeling,
49:21
yes [laughs]
49:23
. So, what were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how have
49:27
those dialogues shifted over time?
49:31
So, I remember in ’88—yeah, so I started in ’88, so maybe in ’89 or
49:37
’90 I put together a paper that was comparing all the GCM projections
49:42
together and my colleague, soon to be team leader, Ron Neilson, reviewed that paper.
49:51
He told me that I was comparing oranges and apples and that this
49:56
was never going to be published and this was not the way to go.
49:59
A few years later everybody was doing it, and that was the
50:02
way he ended up doing it too.
50:05
At first, we were learning what were these GCM, these large climate models, how can
50:11
we deal with it, how can we use them?
50:14
We were learning a lot.
50:16
As biologists, we always wanted to use them for our own purposes, but they
50:20
were designed to look at the globe temperatures, so not at all to look at
50:25
what was happening to a small forest or grassland in a small area of a state.
50:32
The scaling issues has always been a huge, huge problem, a “problem.” As we’ve been
50:39
going through a climate change world,
50:44
the GCM, the General Circulation Models, have actually increased in
50:50
spatial resolution and so they’re getting closer, although how close
50:56
they’re going to get I don’t know, but
51:00
we know a lot more about how to compare models to each other,
51:04
but they’re such complex beasts and it’s really challenging.
51:09
As people start linking the vegetation and the ocean and the atmosphere, these
51:16
models are getting more and more complex.
51:18
I remember at the end of the IBP, the International Biology Program,
51:23
in the ‘70s, one of the things that had happened, and they were very
51:26
complex models, and nobody knew why we got the answers we got because it
51:30
was so complicated to go backwards to figure out what was the real trigger.
51:35
There’s always that danger.
51:36
We always want to put a lot of details, and sometimes the details—they’re
51:41
important at the local scale and for people who are really interested
51:44
in that aspect—but to simulate the future, it may not be so important.
51:49
But then again, butterfly wing on one part of the world...
51:56
anyway, things have changed.
51:59
The biologists have been talking a lot closer with the climate
52:02
modelers, so we actually share information a little bit easier.
52:05
There’s still plenty of jargon we don’t get.
52:08
There’s still a lot of assumption that the biologist and climatologist
52:13
have they don’t necessarily share, not because they don’t want to but
52:16
because they don’t think about it.
52:18
We need to have more conversation to really understand what we each
52:22
assume, each part of each team.
52:26
But at the time, we were scientists.
52:28
We developed all of this and we were trying to do our best, and all this media
52:33
and political thing started on the side and we really didn’t pay attention to it.
52:38
It was just like whatever.
52:39
It just mushroomed into something that’s very unpalatable.
52:43
We don’t quite understand what the big deal is.
52:46
It’s like scientists have always disagreed and will continue to
52:49
disagree, but that’s how we learn.
52:52
But making that to the level of disagreement that we have now and climate
52:57
deniers who believe and not believe.
52:59
It’s just science, we’re just trying to do our best.
53:03
Those models are not perfect.
53:05
Of course, they’re not.
53:06
Again, they’re tools.
53:07
They’re the best tools we have, so it’s kind of stupid to say—you
53:11
know it’s like I have a car, but I do use my bicycle so it’s just
53:14
like I don’t see what the point is.
53:15
It’s just like everything is accused.
53:20
What kind of policy changes would you like to see happen within the U.S.?
53:24
You don’t want me to answer that one
53:27
[laughs] . Let’s say that if we rolled back the time about
53:30
a year ago we were on track.
53:33
I wish we were still—we are signatories of the Paris
53:37
Agreement, no matter what is said.
53:40
This country signed the agreement, so we can’t just walk out by the way.
53:47
I just hope that the next president will pay attention to the future and have a
53:50
vision and line up with the rest of the world, renewables and redistribution
53:56
and conservation of resources.
53:59
That should be first.
54:00
Conservation of resources should be the number one priority in this country.
54:08
What changes to public education do you think can help Americans better understand
54:13
climate change, or change their behavior?
54:16
Yeah, so public education.
54:18
That’s an interesting question, depending at what level you’re talking about.
54:24
There’s been a lot of polls and we’ve seen that science teachers are not
54:28
totally cognizant of the science.
54:30
I think that’s actually what we say _____ gardens, the scientists who do research.
54:35
We’ve been using jargon, we’ve been submitting papers in journals that are not
54:40
read by your average teacher, obviously.
54:43
We haven’t worked with the media very much, and now we’re in a situation
54:47
where we don’t have many scientific journalists for the big newspapers
54:52
and the internet gives you all sorts of not reliable information.
54:57
It’s very difficult to sift through.
54:59
Young people have a tendency to be in social media more in encyclopedias,
55:04
and so I think getting young people involved in observation, in monitoring.
55:10
There’s a lot of talk about citizen science for the last 10 years.
55:14
I think getting the children to pay attention, to keep track of
55:18
what’s been happening through their little lives to see the changes.
55:23
Again, start to get them interested in the outdoors, curious about the
55:28
changes, not afraid but curious so that the understand what’s going on.
55:35
I think the missing bit in the outdoor bit as just as scientists we need more
55:40
data because things are changing, and we don’t know what direction it’s going
55:44
to take, so it’s really important that we pay attention to what’s going on and
55:49
the younger generation is the best way.
55:51
They need to really record what they know, what they see today so
55:55
that when they become adults 20 or 30 years from now they’ll be able
55:58
to understand what has happened.
56:01
Unfortunately, the funding for monitoring is going down the tubes,
56:04
so that’s also a shameful situation, especially in this country.
56:11
Also, translational science is an article that just came out.
56:16
Toni Morelli on the east coast, she seems to be the leader for that.
56:23
There’s a huge lack there.
56:24
We have the scientists and we have the general public, or the managers, and
56:28
there’s very little real communication.
56:31
So, the translation bit is missing.
56:33
It’s something you don’t learn at school, even at OSU there’s no class
56:36
that explains how to do translational science and it’s teaching people to do
56:41
presentations that are not boring, to stop putting bullet points with a gazillion,
56:46
or tables with 15—these are things that we’ve always said but to interact with
56:51
the public and to write letters to the editor is to keep your vocabulary simple,
56:57
to focus on things that are important instead of arguing with people who don’t
57:02
agree with what you think, it’s really showing examples of things that are
57:06
happening, focusing on the positive.
57:09
There’s a lot of happy things that are happening around the world.
57:12
Climate change is always painted as something dramatic that’s going to
57:17
kill species and things like that.
57:18
There’s also going to be opportunities and so focusing on that and also
57:23
the tremendous opportunity for young people to actually have so much to do
57:28
to understand the changes and see how society can deal with the changes.
57:35
The education sector has a lot to—but I think the burden on
57:38
the scientists is tremendous.
57:41
We really need to be cognizant of what we do and being able to
57:45
translate it into clear wording.
57:49
There are a few people who work on that but not enough.
57:53
There’s a person, Peter—what’s his last name?
57:59
He’s a storyteller.
58:00
His father was a professor at UW and he’s an actor.
58:05
He goes on stage and talks about salmon.
58:07
His show is salmon people.
58:10
He tells stories from salmon to the Indian, the salmon people, going
58:16
through all the different animals and plants in the forest and so it’s
58:20
a very charming story about what’s happening from the stream all the
58:24
way to the forest and people love it and get the idea and it’s a story.
58:29
He’s part scientist through his dad, who’s very rigorous, but he designs his stories
58:35
to actually tell people what’s happening.
58:37
Another person in Nevada, in University of Reno, he’s a
58:44
lit teacher and professor there and he tells stories about the
58:47
desert and about the great basin.
58:50
Again, he writes books that are really humorous, but you also
58:53
learn about what’s happening in the desert by reading the whole story.
58:56
You don’t have to antagonize people or bore them to death with numbers
59:01
to actually make them understand how important those natural systems are.
59:07
It’s a huge challenge and I wish OSU would have a program on
59:13
translational science, and I’ll be asking a few people about that.
59:18
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
59:23
I’m very hopeful for the planet itself.
59:25
I think plants and animals, they may not be exactly the same as what we know today,
59:30
but I think they know what they’re doing.
59:32
Nature has a tendency to actually react and survive.
59:38
What our society’s going to do with it is another story, whether we’re going
59:43
to blow up the planet or actually modify genetically every being on this planet
59:49
so there will be only one genome at the end—I’m not a genetically modified
59:56
advocate whatsoever or assisted migration.
1:00:01
I think we are in general what humans have done has not been that successful.
1:00:06
We always have a good intention.
1:00:08
We do things.
1:00:09
We think we’re God and we can change things for the better, but in general
1:00:14
we regret those things like bringing rabbits in Australia or whatever.
1:00:19
I know a lot of people are well-intentioned, but I
1:00:22
don’t trust that very much.
1:00:25
I’ve seen a lot of examples of adaptation that are happening.
1:00:30
I see migrations happening.
1:00:33
But I see fragmentation of the landscape limiting these migrations.
1:00:39
I see pesticides killing a lot more than any rise in temperature.
1:00:44
I think the human impacts are negative in general versus the climate, which
1:00:51
I think gives enough leeway to plants and animals to actually deal with it.
1:00:59
Sure, we have plants that will die and animals that will die but it’s
1:01:03
not something that’s brand new.
1:01:05
I’m very hopeful for the planet as whole, as long as we don’t ruin it.
1:01:11
I think our species is exponential and eventually our species will be
1:01:16
extinct, and the earth will be a lot better as long as we let it.
1:01:24
Well, on that note [laughs]
1:01:26
. [Laughs]
1:01:27
. Thank you for participating in this project.
1:01:29
You’re welcome.
1:01:30
I appreciate your time.
1:01:31
Thank you.
