00:02
Today is Dec. 19th, 2017.
00:05
I’m here at the Valley Library with Dr. Jeff Bethel, a professor in the School of
00:10
Biological and Population Health Sciences.
00:13
Today, we’re gonna talk about his research, as it relates to
00:16
global warming in particular.
00:18
But I’d like to start with your background.
00:21
Where were you born?
00:21
I was born in San Diego, California.
00:24
Is that where you grew up?
00:26
Yeah, I grew up about 30 minutes north of San Diego in Carlsbad, California.
00:30
Lived in the same house till I left for college.
00:33
What did your parents do?
00:35
Both my parents were educators in the middle school and high school levels.
00:39
My dad was a teacher/coach for many years, and athletic director, and
00:43
then became a principal in his last several years before he retired.
00:46
My mom was a middle school counselor, and then a high school counselor
00:50
towards the end of her career.
00:51
So, educators for 35+ years.
00:55
Was there an expectation for you to go to university after school?
00:58
It wasn’t really spoken, but it was what I knew.
01:01
Both my parents had master degrees and my older sister got into college.
01:05
And I was a good student.
01:11
The expectation was more internal—just, I’m going to college.
01:15
What were your interests growing up?
01:18
As a kid, mostly sports.
01:21
[Laughs] I was into playing sports year-round, one after another growing up.
01:27
But I was always good at math and science.
01:31
And I’d always wanted to be a small town physician, growing up.
01:35
That was kind of my goal in life, as a young kid and getting into middle
01:40
school, and early in high school.
01:43
And you ended up going to UC Davis?
01:46
Yeah, I went to UC Davis.
01:48
It was the last school I visited.
01:49
Applied to all UCs.
01:50
You know, I was a California kid and got into all of them.
01:56
But Berkeley and L.A. just felt too big for me, being from a relatively
02:01
small town of 60,000 people.
02:04
Davis just felt perfect.
02:06
And it fit me really well, stronger in the sciences.
02:10
And I just loved my time at Davis so much.
02:13
In fact, I went back for graduate school.
02:16
And your bachelor’s degree is in biochemistry?
02:19
Biochem, yeah.
02:20
And then after undergraduate, I moved back to San Diego and
02:24
worked at a biotech company.
02:26
I was their first employee they ever hired, doing contract research,
02:30
developing rapid diagnostic tests, lateral flow assays.
02:34
I was by myself for months at a time while the two owners were
02:39
out jumping up business—until I got a friend of mine, graduate of
02:43
Davis, several months later a job.
02:45
And there was the two of us, working in the lab.
02:49
Did that for two and a half years.
02:50
And I realized just before that time ended that I did not want to be on
02:54
the bench for the rest of my life.
02:57
And kind of explored—I’m interested in health and medicine, like I mentioned,
03:01
and was very analytical, good at math.
03:04
And I was talking to a friend at a family party who was getting her
03:08
masters in epidemiology at UC Berkeley.
03:12
And I didn’t really know much about epidemiology.
03:14
I knew public health.
03:15
But we were talking and she was describing epi.
03:19
I said, “This is for me.” It’s perfect, conducting studies and
03:23
using my quantitative background in a health related field.
03:27
It was for me.
03:29
Did more research and went back to Davis.
03:32
Had you had exposure to undergraduate research as a student?
03:36
A little.
03:37
Just a basic lab job on campus.
03:40
But that was about it.
03:42
And did you know that you wanted to pursue a Ph.D. as opposed to a
03:45
master’s when you went back to school?
03:47
Initially, when I went back to Davis, I was in the master’s program.
03:52
But they had a unique program.
03:53
I just switched over to the Ph.D. track.
03:55
They have the same requirements the first couple of years so the only difference was
03:59
just continue on to get your dissertation, or, to complete your dissertation.
04:03
So the epidemiology program is in the School of Medicine.
04:08
But it sounds like you had a research focused Ph.D. Is that correct?
04:14
So it was housed, actually, within the School of Veterinary
04:16
Medicine and School of Medicine.
04:18
And I linked up with a professor, Dr. Marc Schenker who’s the—just
04:26
retired—director of the Western Center of Agriculture Health and
04:29
Safety at UC Davis, one of a CDC/NIOSH funded ag, health and safety center.
04:35
And he needed some work done by graduate students.
04:40
And it was really my first big entry into research.
04:49
He was conducting a study, looking
04:53
at the Hispanic paradox that immigrant Latino women had better birth
04:57
outcomes compared to their native-born counterparts, despite lower SCS,
05:02
lower education, less access to care.
05:04
That was the broader goal.
05:07
But I was focused on the agricultural exposures, occupational exposures.
05:13
So we conducted the stats, comparing farming workers to non-farm workers,
05:16
and one who didn’t work, all Latino women, and compared their birth
05:20
outcomes: preterm, low birth weight, deliveries and other birth outcomes.
05:26
And then heat was a big part, working in farm workers in
05:31
Central Valley, California.
05:32
That’s really when I first got into this issue or idea, or interest,
05:37
in climate change—was this workers working in very hot conditions,
05:44
and impact on their health.
05:47
What was the data collection process like?
05:49
I’m assuming it’s survey based?
05:51
And do you speak Spanish?
05:52
So we had about 1,200 women enrolled in the study.
05:57
And they had a baseline interview, very extensive.
06:01
I think it was a three-hour-interview, looking at nutritional background,
06:08
stress and social support, basic demographics, sexual history,
06:13
smoking, drug use, you name it.
06:17
That was the baseline.
06:18
They were recruited out of prenatal clinics in Stockton, California.
06:22
And we followed them through their delivery.
06:25
And then we accessed their medical records and abstracted all the data regarding
06:30
their pregnancy and their delivery.
06:33
And I wouldn’t call myself bilingual.
06:35
But I can speak pretty well.
06:39
And one of my duties was, before we got to analysis phrases, to track down
06:43
the women who—we call “lost the follow up”—moved away or we couldn’t locate.
06:48
Because we spent a lot of time and energy on these baseline interviews in our study,
06:52
we wanted to make sure we capture all the women who we enrolled, get outcome
06:56
data on all of them for efficiency and to make better use of our data.
07:01
Did it seem like climate change was
07:07
becoming relevant to other labs within that program?
07:11
Climate change at that time.
07:13
I was in this ag, health and safety world so within that area, yes.
07:18
Climate change, at that time, thinking back 15+ years now, was
07:25
global warming at the time, I think.
07:26
I’m not sure if the terms are being used at that time.
07:30
But without question, the occupational hazards to these workers were, in part,
07:38
rooted in climate, primarily heat.
07:42
And there were ergonomic issues then, adding to climate change.
07:47
But that’s when I really started this interest in these environmental
07:51
exposures due to climate, among this very vulnerable population who has
07:56
to work outdoors in the most part.
08:00
And they don’t have a lot of power and they typically get paid by
08:04
the piece, how much they pick.
08:06
And they are incentivized to keep working and not taking breaks, taking steps
08:12
that will prevent heat-related illness.
08:14
So that’s where I got my interest in climate and health started there.
08:20
Did you teach while you were in grad school?
08:22
I did not.
08:23
Very different than here in Oregon State, I did not have
08:26
any teaching responsibilities.
08:27
So I was a graduate assistant with Dr. Schenker.
08:31
And then I transitioned to a fellowship I obtained the last three years.
08:36
They gave me a research stipend, a travel stipend, a monthly stipend
08:40
to live on towards admissions.
08:42
So I didn’t have to teach.
08:45
So when you were done with your Ph.D., it looks like you left
08:47
academia and went to the CDC.
08:49
I did.
08:51
I wasn’t sure which route I wanted to go, so I applied for this CDC’s
08:55
CSDE, applied epi fellowship.
08:58
And that’s where I was
09:02
entering the program onto a matching process.
09:04
And I matched with a program in San Diego, part of CDC, the Division
09:09
of Global Migration and Quarantine.
09:12
It was formally a quarantine station.
09:15
But in San Diego—most quarantine stations in the country are based
09:19
in airports, a lot of inspection—we didn’t do any of that in San Diego.
09:24
Their area of interest was the port of entry, the land border.
09:27
And really what it was is binationally surveillance for infectious
09:30
diseases, which is fascinating to me.
09:32
So I did a just-short-of two year applied epi fellowship with CDC there then.
09:37
And that transitioned into a full-time position with CDC.
09:40
And that was an amazing experience.
09:47
I travelled to Morgantown, West Virginia, to do some training with NIOSH.
09:54
I got to do a project in Miami, looking at the transmission of infectious disease
09:58
on cruise ships from crew to passengers.
10:01
Not really climate related at this time.
10:04
And then, of course, my main responsibilities at San Diego,
10:07
looking at the land border—the
10:11
division was tasked with stopping the entrance and spread of
10:14
infectious diseases into the United States, which is impossible.
10:17
So that’s why we took a more binational approach.
10:20
So we worked with our counterparts in Mexico.
10:23
They have a very different system.
10:25
They had to get approval for everything in Mexico City at the federal level,
10:31
while in United States, the county was more used to working more locally.
10:36
But that was an amazing experience working with a foreign country, with city
10:40
officials, health officials in Tijuana.
10:42
It was just a tremendous experience.
10:44
Do you feel like that experience has given you a unique perspective
10:48
on the US-Mexico border outside of the political discussion?
10:52
Oh yeah.
10:52
Actually, it’s a geopolitical border.
10:54
People live in one, work in the other; live in one, their
10:58
kids go to school on the other.
11:00
It goes both ways.
11:02
It’s the busiest port of entry in the world.
11:04
I don’t have the numbers off the top of my head—I used to know those numbers
11:06
of people who go across, just one port of entry in San Ysidro everyday.
11:10
But when pandemic, influenza, hit, there was talk of closing the border.
11:16
And that was just not feasible—you can’t do it.
11:20
But yeah, growing up in San Diego, we used to go down to Rosarito
11:26
Beach for lobster.
11:27
So I was comfortable traveling to Mexico.
11:29
I’m used to it.
11:31
But it’s a different experience,
11:36
working at the border region for the goals of prompt identification of people with
11:43
infectious diseases to stop the spread.
11:45
That’s what we’re trying to do.
11:48
And what did you think of the culture of the CDC and working of that organization?
11:52
I think 90+% of CDC employees are around Atlanta.
11:57
So I was in a field station, so to speak.
12:00
So, it was a different experience for me than workers and employees in Atlanta.
12:04
But I travelled there frequently and we all got together.
12:07
But in my division, it was extremely supportive of what I wanted to do.
12:12
I was unique, I had a Ph.D.—most employees had a master’s in public health.
12:19
So our higher ups are very supportive of me publishing and going to
12:23
conferences, which was pretty rare.
12:25
It was a great experience.
12:27
And my first job in academia really valued that experience I had at CDC.
12:33
Why did you decide to return to academia?
12:39
A couple reasons.
12:40
One, I
12:43
was overqualified for what I was doing.
12:46
A Ph.D. is a research degree and I wasn’t getting those research opportunities.
12:52
But like I said, they encouraged me to publish and go to conferences.
12:55
That
12:57
was one reason.
12:59
I was trained to research.
13:00
I wasn’t really getting those opportunities as much as I hoped.
13:03
The
13:05
red tape, the bureaucracy, was weighing on me a little bit.
13:08
I was working on a influenza surveillance system with a cruise ship.
13:13
Private company so they were ready to go yesterday, and I was dating my proposals.
13:20
In a year, I ticked off.
13:21
And I went, this is amazing, this is kinda hard to do.
13:25
So between those two main reasons, I wanted more independence.
13:29
I knew in academia—there’s still bureaucracy in academia, of
13:32
course—I can have more independence.
13:34
It’s on me to write grants and successfully obtain money.
13:38
So it’s all on me.
13:39
I’m not waiting for someone else to do things.
13:41
I can be more independent.
13:42
And I can better utilize my training.
13:45
So that’s why I jumped back to academia.
13:48
And you ended up at East Carolina University?
13:51
Yeah.
13:51
So the applied epi fellowship I had wasn’t a traditional academic
13:56
postdoc where you do research.
13:58
So, short of that experience, I think I landed in a perfect place at ECU,
14:05
East Carolina University, in the School of Medicine there, Department
14:08
of Public Health, at an MPH program.
14:13
We also have a small faculty with a lot of students, even more than we have here.
14:18
So I was doing a lot.
14:19
That’s where I really learned how to be a grant writer.
14:23
I didn’t have much experience doing that before I went to ECU, and be in
14:28
a tenure-track assistant professor.
14:30
I had to balance the teaching, the research, the service.
14:35
Started learning how to say no to things, which is a very
14:40
important skill for an academic.
14:42
And it was a wonderful experience.
14:44
I was there three years.
14:47
And I still keep in touch with students from that.
14:50
I was
14:52
there, starting nine years ago.
14:55
And left six years ago.
14:56
And I just met a former student of mine at a conference in
15:00
Atlanta a couple weeks ago.
15:02
Great experience.
15:03
It was a good experience for me and my wife at the time.
15:08
We were married and we’re still married now.
15:10
We moved to the South and that was a really great experience,
15:14
living someplace different.
15:17
Not sure I would’ve had that experience otherwise.
15:20
Different environment, different weather.
15:22
That’s when I really learned the humidity.
15:25
[Laughs] I wasn’t used to humidity before I moved to the south.
15:28
And it was just a tremendous experience.
15:30
I met some great people, good friends.
15:33
But then the pull back west was strong.
15:37
It sounds like you were teaching?
15:40
Yeah, teaching graduate students.
15:43
And that’s where I continued further my work in agriculture, health and
15:48
safety, specifically in heat stress.
15:51
And North Carolina has a longer growing season than the West
15:55
Coast, from May through November.
15:58
And, like I mentioned before, their summers are extremely hot and humid,
16:05
and have a very high heat index value which is a combination of
16:09
temperature and relative humidity.
16:11
So their workers were at much greater risk for heat-related illness than workers on
16:18
the West Coast, with that humidity factor.
16:21
So I continued working in that area.
16:22
Then I started incorporating other dimensions of climate change into my
16:26
work, like natural disasters preparedness.
16:30
Really, where those parts of my portfolio started to take off was in North Carolina.
16:36
And how did you end up at Oregon State?
16:39
I saw a position opening, assistant professor epidemiology, here at
16:46
Oregon State University in College of Public Health and Human Sciences.
16:49
The College was expanding from a MPH program to a fully accredited school.
16:55
And with that, they need to hire a lot of faculty.
16:58
And I was happy where I was.
16:59
The plan was to get tenure back there, and then eventually move back west.
17:04
But this was too good to pass up.
17:06
The UC schools, at that time, were under an intense budget restriction.
17:10
They weren’t gonna hire anytime soon.
17:13
So I put my name in the hat, see what happens.
17:17
And my family was very happy.
17:21
I was given an interview, no pressure on the interview or anything.
17:26
[Laughs] And it all worked out.
17:29
And here we are.
17:29
And we were thrilled to be here, to move back west, to be in Oregon State
17:34
University, and to be in Corvallis.
17:36
It’s a wonderful city.
17:38
We have two kids now.
17:38
We moved here with a 9-month-old and have a second daughter.
17:44
Were there people who’re important to getting you settled
17:46
in when you arrived at OSU?
17:49
Yeah.
17:53
Anna Harding was one of the school co-directors at the time.
17:57
She’s since retired.
17:59
She’s in the Environmental and Occupational Health program.
18:03
She was instrumental in getting me here, really solidifying this
18:09
is a great place to me, as well as
18:15
OSU has many different climate science programs.
18:18
So I met with Phil Mote during my interview.
18:20
I requested that.
18:21
And he was open to collaborating.
18:23
His group hadn’t really done much in the health world but he encouraged me
18:28
to come, and to be a part of that group.
18:31
And I’m a funded member of his group, now one of the groups in the
18:34
Climate Impacts Research Consortium.
18:36
So those are the two, among others, that really sold me on
18:40
this is a good place for me.
18:41
Cuz it could be a good fit geographically, but if it’s not a good
18:46
fit professionally, it’s not gonna last.
18:48
So that was always secondary.
18:51
But it had to be a good fit professionally.
18:52
And it was, and it is.
18:55
So, moving more into your research, you referenced disaster preparedness.
19:01
How do you evaluate disaster preparedness within a particular
19:05
community or population?
19:06
A couple different ways to assess preparedness.
19:10
One of my interests is at the household level.
19:11
So I teach a graduate-level disaster epidemiology class.
19:16
And putting it together—it was a new course, I think I’ve taught it four
19:21
times now—I was overly ambitious.
19:25
And I’m glad I was at the time, because I decided to have the students
19:29
conduct a CASPER, Community Assessment for Preparedness Emergency Response.
19:34
It’s a methodology developed by CDC, rooted in immunization coverage
19:39
assessment from WHO, in which you essentially do door-to-door surveys.
19:46
And it has a two-stage sampling scheme—we don’t need to get into that here.
19:49
But the students get the experience using census data, using some GIS
19:53
software to identify a random sample of clusters or block groups in Corvallis—we
19:59
do it in Corvallis every year.
20:01
And at the second stage, we do systematic sampling every tenth
20:06
house, or whatever the interval is.
20:09
We’d develop a questionnaire, using CDC temples and other existing questionnaires.
20:14
And we just ask questions about preparedness.
20:16
And we’ve done that for four times now.
20:19
It’s been a great experience for the students.
20:22
And I’ve also been presenting those data at conferences
20:27
regionally in the Northwest, in Oregon, as well as nationally.
20:31
And like I said, it’s an ambitious project for me to organize it.
20:35
I’ve put more on the students since that first year.
20:38
And the students get an experience doing sampling, doing data
20:42
analysis, writing up the report.
20:45
But that’s just my project.
20:46
But other communities, primarily public health departments, have done CASPERs to
20:51
assess their communities’ preparedness.
20:54
They’ve been done all throughout the country.
20:57
Even here in Washington County, Oregon, did one recently.
21:03
Crook County did one regarding drought.
21:06
They have been done in Michigan, Tennessee, Kentucky—all over the
21:10
country using similar methods—Huston.
21:13
You can use the same methods to assess the impact of a disaster, that same
21:16
sampling scheme to go door to door, to use as a rapid needs assessment for
21:21
affected communities after disasters.
21:23
That’s the primary use of the CASPER.
21:25
But we’ve used it to also assess preparedness.
21:28
Do you try to assess why there are differences in
21:34
preparedness between populations?
21:36
For example, does, say, education around climate change
21:40
affect how someone prepares?
21:43
We haven’t really done much into examining differences between groups or populations.
21:49
It’s a—I’m pretty sure—questionnaire.
21:51
We gotta keep it in ten minutes so it’s one piece of paper, front and back.
21:54
That’s it.
21:54
And we get more at the tangible supplies.
21:57
We have asked them questions, if you were under mandatory evacuation,
22:02
why wouldn’t you evacuate.
22:03
It was very few people.
22:05
We have made some comparisons looking at homeowners versus
22:08
people who rent their homes.
22:10
And this last group did find a big difference in preparedness levels
22:14
between homeowners and renters.
22:16
Homeowners were much more prepared than renters.
22:18
We haven’t brought in the climate piece yet.
22:20
We have asked about what hazard are you most concerned about.
22:25
In the Northwest, it’s earthquake, not climate related.
22:29
But it’s big earthquake and then winter storms, and flooding.
22:38
Do you make recommendations based on how communities could be better prepared?
22:43
So in our project, everybody gets some information that we obtain from
22:48
American Red Cross about how each household can better prepare itself.
22:52
And we found that just administering the questionnaire is an intervention in
22:56
itself, getting people to think about some of them never thought about: “Oh we don’t
23:00
have supplies of food, water, first-aid kit.”—despite the fact that maybe they’re
23:05
not prepared, just asking questions. We haven’t gone back to assess this
23:10
but anecdotally, the feedback from the students is that the respondents have told
23:13
them, “Wow I never thought about this.
23:15
This is something I need to do.”
23:17
Other research, not my own, has looked at—back to your previous
23:21
questions—differences in preparedness.
23:24
People who’ve experienced disasters in the past are more
23:26
prepared for it in the future.
23:30
And there’s different interventions being developed in how to increase preparedness.
23:34
I haven’t gotten into the intervention part yet.
23:37
For that slice, my research’s preparedness assessment.
23:42
So going back to your work with farm laborers, can you talk about
23:48
how you anticipate farm laborers will be affected by climate change?
23:51
You mentioned heat earlier.
23:53
Are there other exposures that you’ve thought about?
23:57
Sure.
23:58
Outdoor workers in general, heat’s the big one.
24:01
The biggest concern is working in hot conditions.
24:06
Air pollution’s the other one, not as much work in that area I think because
24:12
it’s not as big a concern as heat.
24:14
But heat is number one among all outdoor workers, particularly farm workers.
24:18
As I mentioned before, this is a group that are not really
24:23
part of organized labor.
24:24
They’re a vulnerable population.
24:25
They typically get paid by the piece.
24:27
So the incentives aren’t there to take steps to protect themselves.
24:31
So heat is really the big one.
24:34
Okay.
24:35
How do you think they can be better protected against heat related illness?
24:38
Do you think implementing policies or training would help with that?
24:42
Yeah.
24:42
So California and Washington are the two states in the United States that
24:45
have a specific heat rule, addressing outdoor workers, including farm workers.
24:51
And each state’s heat rules are very similar.
24:54
They differ somewhat.
24:55
But they have provisions for portable water, rest breaks in the shade,
25:01
trainings, emergency response protocols.
25:05
Things like that.
25:06
And in California broadly, heat-related illness is now a
25:10
reportable condition in California.
25:11
That’s a big deal so you’d know what the problem is, or the
25:15
magnitude of the problem in this case, heat-related illness.
25:19
But really training, not just of the works but of the supervisors and the
25:23
growers, so everybody’s on the same page about how it’s a preventable condition.
25:29
And growers are different.
25:31
Some are very supportive, some not so much.
25:34
Some, they’ll be aware of the forecast, then they’ll change the work schedule:
25:40
“It’s gonna be heat index value of over 100 today, or over 90. Let’s
25:44
start early, get the work done early.
25:46
And then we can take a long break and do something in thelate afternoon.” So
25:50
there’s plenty of concerned growers, how they want to protect their workers.
25:56
But training is really important.
25:58
And
26:01
the training of the workers is you’d have a buddy system, train the workers
26:06
to have them be aware of the symptoms, cuz they range from profuse sweating—of
26:11
course they’re gonna be doing, cuz they’re working hard—muscle cramps,
26:15
to nausea, dizziness, vomiting, all the way to fainting and perhaps death.
26:21
But having a buddy system and each looking for the symptoms in the
26:25
other is one step that they can take.
26:28
Again, portable water is important.
26:30
These workers, they’re out in the field, getting water to them so they don’t wanna
26:34
feel compelled to take ten minutes to stop work—again, that could affect their pay.
26:40
So water needs to be close.
26:42
Portable shade structures, misters, fans, those kinds of things.
26:48
And put it in, frame it in a way that I think the growers will be
26:53
supportive of it—the ones that’re a little skeptical—that healthy
26:56
workers are more productive workers.
26:57
I think it’s one approach to take.
27:00
You’ve mentioned how they get paid has been a big factor.
27:04
Do you think that if that was changed, if they were paid by the hour,
27:09
that would affect their behavior?
27:11
Possibly.
27:12
Not all are paid by the piece.
27:15
So in my small study I conducted—it wasn’t large enough to compare their
27:19
experiences, those paid by the hours versus the piece—we showed a small
27:24
difference in those paid by the piece, had a greater rate of reporting
27:29
heat-related illness symptoms.
27:31
So, given that—but I think it’s more intuitive, it makes sense that—those
27:36
who are paid by the hour will feel more comfortable taking a break.
27:42
And similarly, I think growers need to insist on breaks, particularly on
27:47
those who are being paid by the piece, like, “You need to take a break.
27:50
It’s getting to a certain heat level.
27:53
You need to take a ten-minute break, drink some water in the shade.” But
27:56
I think paid by the hour would help.
27:59
It’s not the only solution, but it’ll help.
28:04
Are there other issues related to human health and climate change,
28:07
say, with other communities or populations, that you’ve thought of
28:10
maybe studying in the future or that you think needs to be studied further?
28:13
Sure.
28:15
As part of my work with one of Oregon State’s climate groups,
28:20
Climate Impacts Research Consortium, CIRC, I have some funds.
28:23
I’m working with a county up in southwestern Washington, a coastal
28:28
community, to work through this—it’s called the—BRACE framework.
28:32
Also developed by CDC, it’s Building Resilience Against Climate Effects.
28:36
And it’s this interview process by which communities can identify their local
28:40
climate hazards and vulnerabilities.
28:43
And do some projections on the corresponding health outcomes
28:47
to those climate impacts.
28:49
So, what’s it gonna look like 30 years down the line, for heat-related
28:52
illness for example, or air pollution, respiratory disease, things like that.
28:56
And identifying interventions to help prevent the increase in
29:01
those health-related outcomes.
29:03
And all leading towards development of a climate and health adaptation plan.
29:07
That’s what I’m currently doing with the community in Washington.
29:10
We’re not, again, just looking at one climate impact or health outcome.
29:14
It’s being conducted in conjunction with the community side by side.
29:19
So, it’s a collaborative effort.
29:21
“What are they interested in,” because different communities have different
29:26
interests.
29:27
Am I correct in understanding that you work on BRACE with Oregon’s Climate and
29:32
Health Resilience Plan for the state?
29:34
Is that correct?
29:36
Oregon Health Authority received funds from CDC to conduct
29:40
BRACE with counties in Oregon.
29:44
And I was peripherally involved in that process.
29:48
They dispense funds to six or seven counties and work with them to do BRACE.
29:54
Now, I’m doing BRACE with a county in Washington because CIRC wanted
29:57
to expand its work into Washington.
29:59
We were a little Oregon centric.
30:03
Now I’d like to move onto some broader climate change questions.
30:08
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how
30:12
have they shifted over time?
30:14
My earliest, as a young person—probably growing up in a coastal community with
30:22
sea level rise and coastal erosion.
30:26
That’s probably my first exposure to climate change.
30:30
In my town in Carlsbad, they put in this big sea wall to help combat that.
30:35
And it’s still there.
30:37
My parents walk that every day.
30:40
Those are my earliest discussions, or exposure, to climate change.
30:43
It’s really coastal erosion, sea level rise.
30:48
It’s evolved really, I think, consistent with my research of heat-related illness,
30:54
disaster preparedness and impacts of natural disasters, as well as this
31:00
broader approach working with communities.
31:03
One of my main interests is trying to bring something
31:06
tangible that a community can use.
31:09
So it requires a lot of technical expertise to work through BRACE.
31:12
Look at these climate models and disease projections.
31:14
That’s where me and others from CIRC can work with communities to help them.
31:23
Can you speak more about CIRC and the community of climate change
31:26
researchers at OSU, and how the institution facilitates this research?
31:32
Yeah.
31:33
So, again, Oregon State has several climate groups, mostly
31:38
funded by NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
31:42
CIRC’s just one.
31:45
And the main goal of CIRC is to put usable data in the hands
31:51
of users to make decisions.
31:55
Others in CIRC—I’m the only person looking at health—in another group
32:01
are working at the same community I’m working with in Washington state, looking
32:05
at sea level rise, coastal erosion.
32:07
So working with members in that community on doing the projections and giving
32:11
them different scenarios that have different impacts, from do nothing to
32:17
put up a big sea wall, and what are the impacts of those options for them.
32:23
So it’s working with the community, help them make their own decisions.
32:28
That’s always the main goal of
32:32
CIRC.
32:32
And there’s other projects within CIRC, developing some software for
32:39
these projections, called Envision.
32:41
We have a community engagement component to CIRC.
32:45
We have folks working on drought, forest fires—those are the big ones.
32:52
A lot of work with utilities—it’s a big stakeholder for CIRC, because they do
32:58
a lot of work regarding climate because they’re looking at this in the future.
33:04
Are you concerned about diminished funding for climate change research?
33:10
Yes.
33:10
How do you foresee yourself coping with that?
33:12
That’s a very good question.
33:13
I’m right in the middle of that now.
33:19
I really articulated my strategy.
33:23
But I think it has to do with how I brand it, how I present it, short of grant
33:33
proposals or conference proposals coming out, specifically to climate change.
33:37
I mean, they’ll be in there, I can respond to that, but in the
33:42
broadening to environmental health.
33:45
I think, looking at it from the perspective of natural disasters, more
33:51
acute events, you don’t talk about climate change to look at what’s the
33:54
best way, or what are the health impacts of different acute national disasters,
34:03
how do we reduce some morbidity mortality from acute natural disasters.
34:08
Like in the earthquakes too—again, not climate related.
34:10
So I think broadening to an environmental health perspective:
34:18
what’s the impact in spread of infectious diseases from a natural
34:23
disaster, flooding for example.
34:27
It’s still climate related.
34:28
It just got me to think about how I present it, how I brand it.
34:35
That’s the reality that we’re in right now, unfortunately.
34:39
Based on your professional experience, and just your perspective in general,
34:44
what policy changes would you like to see happen within the US, again,
34:49
in the context of climate change?
34:51
What policies to compact climate change?
34:55
Yeah, changes in policy, and again, speaking more to your
35:00
professional line of work.
35:02
That’s a big question.
35:06
I guess into my work, all kinds of policies that we could
35:10
implement to help climate change.
35:13
Everybody could drive hybrids tomorrow.
35:17
That would help but that’s not gonna happen.
35:19
So,
35:24
in terms of the farm workers, there’s many different policies
35:30
that can be implemented there.
35:31
Other states could—and probably should—implement heat rules, like
35:34
California and Washington did, and make heat-related illness reportable.
35:38
I think that would go a long way.
35:39
It
35:42
would explicitly identify farm workers as a population susceptible to this
35:47
climate sensitive health outcome.
35:49
That’d be huge.
35:50
Oregon is considering it.
35:52
There’s some talk a little bit ago.
35:56
It’s early in the discussion, so they might reexamine it at
36:02
a later date.
36:03
But again, only two states have those heat rules.
36:07
So that’d be a very important policy change.
36:13
Others regarding farm workers, again as head-related illnesses the most
36:19
important climate-sensitive health outcome, a heat rule would go a long way.
36:25
Others, regarding preparedness, I’m not sure what kind of
36:28
policy we could put in place.
36:30
Education does not bring about behavior change.
36:34
I’m not a behavioral scientist, but at least I know that.
36:36
So handing somebody a brochure is not gonna get them to store supplies of food
36:41
and water and have alternative heat source and cooking source, things like that.
36:50
I think identifying renters, from my study that came up, working with
36:56
property managers could be a very local, small change of policy that
37:01
could be implemented to help renters.
37:03
Property managers could help renters get prepared.
37:08
More broadly in my work, I think communities coming up with their own
37:14
climate and health adaptation plans.
37:15
Again, that’s the end-product of going through the BRACE framework—is for
37:19
each community to know their own local climate hazards, vulnerabilities,
37:26
and expected health outcomes, to make local decisions, because it’s
37:29
always gonna be a local issue.
37:33
You kind of touched on this, but what changes to public education do you think
37:38
can help Americans better understand climate change, or potentially change of
37:46
behaviors?
37:48
I think an educated citizenry is a really important thing, be it climate
37:52
and science, be it public health.
37:54
There’s a push five, six or seven years ago about getting public
37:59
health and epidemiology curriculum into undergraduate training.
38:04
Similarly, in climate science, I think it needs to start with K-12 education.
38:11
And it is happening now.
38:14
It’s gonna come down to science teachers, teaching climate science, and
38:21
I think environmental health as well.
38:23
I think linking it to health is a natural way to get it to sink into people.
38:30
It’s gonna affect them, moving forward, their kids.
38:34
So I think starting K-12 level is the best approach.
38:41
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet, in the context of climate change?
38:42
Yes, I am.
38:42
I hope
38:50
it doesn’t come down to engineering our way out of this.
38:53
But I think with smart people coming up with effective mitigation
38:59
steps—but adaptation is a reality.
39:03
So, I am very hopeful.
39:07
I think more Americans will come to realize the impacts of a changing
39:13
climate, how it’s gonna impact their health, their security.
39:20
Kind of going off a little bit, but I think—and the military’s already thinking
39:23
about this—they see it as a threat to national security, climate change.
39:28
So between health and national security, I think those are two big motivations
39:35
to do something about climate change.
39:38
And I know I am hopeful.
39:39
There’s a lot of good people, a lot of smart people working on this.
39:44
Well, that concludes the interview.
39:47
Thanks for participating.
39:48
Thank you, it was my pleasure.
