00:01
Today is December 15, 2017.
00:05
I’m here with Dr. Peter Clark, distinguished professor of the College of
00:09
Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.
00:11
We’re at the Valley Library.
00:13
Today we’re going to talk about his research and global warming, but I’d
00:18
like to begin with your background.
00:19
Where were you born?
00:21
I was born in Connecticut.
00:23
Is that where you grew up?
00:24
I lived there the first six years of my life and then we moved to California.
00:29
What did your parents do?
00:31
My father was a schoolteacher and my mom was mostly an at-home
00:37
mother but also a schoolteacher.
00:41
Did you have early interests in science or the outdoors?
00:44
Not in science but my interest in the outdoors began when we moved to California
00:53
and that’s when I started doing a lot of backpacking and things like that.
00:59
What part of California?
01:00
We lived near Carpinteria, which is south of Santa Barbara.
01:05
Okay.
01:05
Which has been in the news recently because that’s where
01:07
the big wildfires have been.
01:11
What was your early school experience like?
01:15
Run of the mill.
01:16
Elementary school, nothing unusual.
01:20
Did you have anyone advising you to go to university?
01:24
Was there an expectation to do so?
01:28
Expectation only in the sense that my family has a long history in
01:36
academics and so my father was a teacher at a prep school it’s called,
01:41
which is private school which usually prepares students for, historically,
01:48
prepares students for colleges
01:52
and then on my father’s side we have family that goes back at universities
01:57
for generations and so forth.
02:02
What influenced your decision to go to St. Lawrence University?
02:05
Because that’s where the university was where a bunch of my family had been,
02:08
played a role from the very beginning of the university where my great, great
02:13
grandfather or great grandfather was the first president of the university.
02:19
You end up getting a bachelor’s of science?
02:22
I did, yeah.
02:23
How did you end up choosing to go that route?
02:26
I started at St. Lawrence as an English major, because in high
02:31
school I developed a big interest in reading and literature and so forth.
02:37
Then I started as an English major with a leaning towards journalism but my
02:44
freshman year I had a couple of friends who were geology majors and they suggested
02:50
I take an intro to geology class which I needed to take a science course.
02:54
I took that class.
02:55
I
02:57
was immediately taken by the slides of mountains where I had
03:05
done a lot of backpacking prior to that and so that’s what first
03:08
captured my interest in geology.
03:11
Did you do any undergraduate research?
03:14
I did.
03:16
I stayed as a double major in English and geology for a couple years thinking
03:20
I might go into textbook publishing, things like that, where I could combine
03:26
the two and then just went full out geology after my junior year and
03:30
then my senior year I did a senior thesis and did research for that.
03:36
What influenced your decision to pursue graduate studies?
03:40
It was just the natural thing that a lot of my friends were doing, fellow majors
03:47
they all were moving on to graduate school and I just followed my interests
03:52
as well and thought this is what I was really interested in doing and so I
03:55
wanted to pursue it at the next level.
03:57
Did you anticipate pursuing a Ph.D.?
04:01
I didn’t really have any long-term plans.
04:03
I just kept pursuing my interests.
04:05
So it wasn’t
04:09
in my long-term plans but it was just something I continued
04:12
to follow that course.
04:15
You ended up at the University of Waterloo in Ontario?
04:18
For my masters.
04:19
I went to Waterloo for my masters.
04:20
I applied to several schools and I visited them and my visit at Waterloo
04:26
was very successful and they were able to put out a really nice show
04:36
for me and also the person I applied to work with was somebody I really
04:41
admired, already knew his work and so it was an easy decision to go there.
04:47
Did it feel any different living north of the border?
04:50
Well, St. Lawrence is within 15 miles of the border so we were in Canada
04:54
frequently anyway, just crossing over to Montreal or Ottawa or something.
04:58
So,
05:00
it didn’t really feel any different being across the border at all.
05:05
You studied late Quaternary History ET:ET:_ New York, is that right?
05:11
Did your homework, yeah.
05:12
So my master’s thesis took me back to St. Lawrence University
05:17
in the St. Lawrence Valley and
05:22
so I studied the glacial history of that area.
05:26
Were you particularly drawn to the glacial history or was that research
05:30
that was available to you at that time?
05:32
It was a combination of
05:36
really liking the area north of the Adirondacks in the St. Lawrence
05:39
Valley and the research question was pretty interesting as well.
05:46
Did you teach as a master’s student?
05:48
I did a little bit of teaching assistantships, teaching as a
05:52
teaching assistant but not very much.
05:54
Mostly I was on a research assistantship.
05:56
Did you enjoy that aspect of it?
05:59
I didn’t really get that much flavor for it, or bunch of experience
06:04
at it so I wasn’t quite sure.
06:07
Then you decided to pursue a Ph.D. at the end of your masters?
06:11
Again, I was just following my interests and I was getting more
06:15
and more interest in the field.
06:19
My initial interests in geology as a freshman at St. Lawrence had been in
06:22
the mountains which there the major discussion was on the role of glaciers
06:28
had had in the formation of the landscapes that we’ve seen in the mountains.
06:32
That sparked my interest in glaciers right from the beginning, so that’s what
06:36
I continued to pursue both at my masters and then on to the next level a Ph.D.
06:41
was following that interest in glaciers.
06:44
You completed that at the University of Colorado?
06:47
I did my Ph.D. at the University of Colorado through the geological sciences
06:51
department but specifically at a separate research facility called the
06:55
Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research.
06:59
Again, while at St. Lawrence one of my student jobs had
07:03
been as the science librarian.
07:04
They have a small science library and mine was the librarian there during certain
07:09
hours of the day and while there I would basically browse the new journals as
07:15
they were coming in and being ready to be shelved, so I’d be browsing through
07:19
the geology journals and specifically the ones that were related to glacier studies.
07:26
One of the journals was called Arctic and Alpine Research, which was produced
07:30
out of this place where I ended up for my Ph.D. and right at that point I was
07:36
intrigued by the arctic from looking at that journal and the photographs
07:40
and so forth and I became very familiar with that topic so then I was ready
07:46
to go there for my Ph.D. for sure.
07:48
What was the culture of that research group like?
07:51
It was outstanding.
07:52
It was at the time I would say among if not the best research groups
07:59
for doing the kind of stuff I was doing, both with regard to the
08:02
faculty and the graduate students.
08:06
How did you like life in Boulder?
08:09
Boulder was good, less expensive than it is now, less crowded than it is now.
08:14
Still, it was a nice place and
08:18
I always was a mountain person and so having the Rocky
08:21
Mountains right there was nice.
08:24
You ended up doing research on the glacial history of southern Baffin Island?
08:29
I started on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic for my Ph.D. but
08:35
then after one field season up there I talked to my advisor and again
08:43
harking back to my days in the science library looking at the journals the
08:48
articles that had always struck my interest was in northern Labrador,
08:53
had to do with northern Labrador.
08:55
In northern Labrador there’s a mountain range called the Torngat
08:59
Mountains and Torngat is an Inuit name for the Lord of Evil Wind.
09:06
I wasn’t quite sure why that was the case at the time, but anyways I loved
09:10
the landscapes and was really interested in the studies that had been going on
09:15
and so talking to my Ph.D. advisor I convinced him to move just south of
09:19
southern Baffin to the northern Labrador and work in the Torngat Mountains and
09:22
that’s where my most of my Ph.D. work was doing in the Torngat Mountains.
09:27
That’s where I learned why he’s called the Lord of the Evil Wind,
09:30
because it’s an extremely windy place.
09:34
So, it sounds like you got to visit there for data collection?
09:37
Can you talk about that
09:40
experience?
09:40
Working the arctic is pretty interesting, because it’s very remote.
09:44
In Baffin
09:48
I flew into a small Inuit village and then hired a local Inuit and I had a
09:53
field assistant with me, a friend from St. Lawrence came along to accompany me in the
09:58
field because you don’t want to go alone.
10:02
We hired a local Inuit person to take us by his canoe, which had an onboard
10:07
motor, down the fjord to the coastline, the main coastline of southern Baffin.
10:13
He dropped us off there for two weeks and then picked us up two weeks later.
10:16
It was pretty remarkable that he did that.
10:20
In Labrador to get to the Torngat Mountains basically you have to fly in
10:23
by a float plane and so we would fly in from either Schefferville, Quebec,
10:31
or another place south of Ungava Bay called Kangiqsualujjuaq,
10:39
or, excuse me, Kuururjuaq, so we would from either of those two places fly in
10:44
by float plane and with six weeks of food and backpacks and they would drop us off
10:51
and then they’d pick us up 6 weeks later and then we’d do our fieldwork while
10:53
we were up there, just the two of us.
10:56
That sounds pretty amazing landscape to be in.
10:59
Yeah.
11:01
Did you teach as a Ph.D.?
11:03
I did not.
11:03
I was always on a research assistantship.
11:07
After you completed your Ph.D. you ended up teaching at the
11:10
University of Illinois in Chicago?
11:11
Mm-hmm [yes]
11:13
. How did you end up at that institution and what was your impression or sense of it?
11:19
Well, I was still six months or nearly a year away from finishing
11:24
my Ph.D., but I thought it’s time to start applying for jobs.
11:29
I applied for the job in Chicago and it was in a field called Sedimentology,
11:36
which I was remotely doing but mostly I was doing glacier stuff, but I was
11:42
invited to interview and I gave a job talk that was glacier sedimentology
11:48
related and they ended up hiring me.
11:52
Before I was done with my Ph.D., even, so they hired me in January and I didn’t
11:57
defend my thesis for another 6 months.
11:59
The first six months I was there I was still working on my Ph.D. and teaching.
12:07
The department chair at the time
12:11
had been a St. Lawrence University alum as well, geology alum from before my
12:15
time, I think he told me that he knew that St. Lawrence produced a lot of good
12:22
geologists and that sort of gave him some good confidence about my abilities,
12:28
even just as an undergrad level.
12:32
That was my first job, just kind of lucked out that the first
12:35
job I applied for I got a job.
12:37
It
12:39
was a nice place to start.
12:44
I’m assuming that you taught while you were there?
12:46
I did teach while I was there.
12:49
I had the usual teaching research service type of tenure-track
12:53
assistant professor position, yep.
12:56
What did you think of living in Chicago?
12:59
Chicago’s a great city.
13:01
It’s a really great city, culturally fantastic.
13:05
It’s culturally diverse.
13:07
Lots of different aspects to it to take advantage of.
13:11
You cross a street and you’re in an entirely different culture.
13:17
There’s little Italy and this ethnicity and this ethnicity and
13:22
this ethnicity, and just crossed.
13:23
They’re very much divided in that regard but you could sample a broad range of
13:31
diversity and the other thing about Chicago is it’s one of the most beautiful
13:35
cities in terms of its architecture.
13:37
It’s spectacular.
13:38
I really enjoyed living there
13:42
for the time I was there.
13:45
Not too many mountains nearby.
13:47
At the time Coors beer had a commercial specifically aimed at Chicago buyers
13:55
which would show the city skyline.
13:58
It’s right on Lake Michigan.
14:00
There’s Lake Michigan and then the city skyline and then as the ad’s
14:04
progressing the Rocky Mountains would pop up behind the skyline.
14:08
I said that’s the only thing missing from here is the mountains.
14:12
Yep.
14:13
What influenced your decision to move to Oregon and work at Oregon State?
14:20
While at Chicago I was happy.
14:22
I had gotten the job there and so forth, but it did not have a Ph.D.
14:25
program and although I love Chicago I was not a city person and it was out
14:32
in the middle of Illinois, so there are several things about it that I was happy
14:39
there but was thinking of moving on.
14:41
I started looking around for other jobs and a job opened up here
14:45
at Oregon State that I applied for and so I got the interview.
14:49
Ended up with the job as well.
14:52
What were your initial impressions of Corvallis?
14:55
You know, nice small town.
14:58
Oregon, all the good things that comes with Oregon.
15:02
It was good.
15:04
Who were people important to getting you settled in?
15:09
Let’s see,
15:14
you mean in terms of colleagues?
15:17
About the time I was hired they were as is often the case with universities
15:23
there’s just through demographics there’s
15:28
a certain age group that’s hired all around the same time and then as they
15:32
age and move on and eventually they’re approaching retirement and so then they
15:35
have to think about replacing them.
15:37
I came in on one of those changeover times that several people had
15:42
retired just before I got there.
15:44
Others were within a certain numbers of years of retiring, so they started hiring
15:48
several young assistant professors.
15:51
I came in at the same time as three or four other assistant professors.
15:55
I was pretty much the last of that hiring group.
16:02
They’d been my colleagues ever since, although they’re now
16:05
starting to retire as well.
16:07
We’re going through the same cycle, basically our slug moving forward
16:11
and now a younger cohort’s coming in.
16:15
They were good colleagues and then the senior faculty
16:18
were very supportive as well.
16:21
When you arrived you were in the Department of
16:23
Geosciences, is that correct?
16:25
AT the time it was the Department of Geology.
16:27
Okay.
16:29
After so many years there was a Department of Geology and a Department of Geography.
16:33
We were all in the same building, Wilkinson Hall, but I don’t remember
16:38
the circumstances that led to it but the university was looking for ways to
16:43
streamline things, so they recommended that we either merge or that geography
16:49
moves to University of Oregon.
16:52
The decision was to merge into
16:56
Geosciences.
16:56
You continued on as a teacher at Oregon State?
16:59
Mm-hmm [yes]
16:59
. How has your role as a teacher evolved over the years?
17:04
I’d say it’s something that although I didn’t have very much experience
17:10
with in graduate school when I started teaching I really loved it and so for
17:16
example the first term that I taught at Chicago after that first term I taught
17:22
at Chicago I received the university’s wide teaching award for that year.
17:31
I must have been doing something right.
17:34
Then I’ve continued to just really enjoy teaching and work hard at doing
17:39
it well and I’ve continued to be recognized for my teaching as well.
17:46
Do you teach undergraduate and graduate students?
17:48
I teach a range from introductory courses to graduate courses, yep.
17:55
Moving more into your research, can you talk about how tools to date ice cores
18:01
or I guess tools that you’ve used through your research have evolved through your
18:06
career and maybe touch on tools you used for predictive climate change modeling?
18:15
I am largely a if you would call a field-based geologist but I’m
18:26
also sort of a synthesizer and then through those two areas of doing the
18:35
fieldwork and also looking at the bigger picture through the synthesizing come
18:41
up with questions and so forth that really need models to investigate.
18:49
So, then
18:52
will reach out to people who run the models.
18:55
I’m not a modeler, but I recognize a good research question and I approach
18:59
modelers with that question and say would you like to collaborate on this?
19:03
That’s kind of how my career has gone is really especially once I moved here
19:08
to Oregon is that sort of collaborative work among colleagues in different
19:15
disciplines, where it be modeling or different aspects of climate change that
19:19
I do but that I’m not an expert in but see an interesting question will reach
19:24
out and ask colleagues to collaborate on.
19:28
So, what’s evolved really is some of the methods we can now use that
19:36
weren’t available at the time to develop the timing of events which
19:42
is critical in terms of understanding climate change because you want to
19:45
know when things change and what that might mean about climate change and
19:50
then the models themselves that I work with that are used by people I work
19:55
with of a variety of sorts have also evolved and improved with time and the
20:01
diversity of models available as well.
20:04
When did your interest in anthropogenic climate change start?
20:12
I’d only been interest in climate change in general had always been out there
20:19
in terms of general interest for me and even when I was at Colorado a research
20:27
scientist there was pretty much thinking about and been involved with some of
20:32
the work in ‘70s and ‘80s on thinking about carbon dioxide emissions in the
20:37
future and forth and ice sheet stability.
20:41
We’d talk a lot about that.
20:45
But again I’d always been working in the geologic time that’s already passed but
20:53
as the evidence if you will of global warming became stronger and its impacts
21:00
on various things that I was studying that had happened in the past, the
21:05
evidence that those things were changing then it became clear that what I was
21:10
studying actually provided important context of how the system had changed
21:15
in the past and what that might mean and inform us about in terms of the future.
21:23
That corollary of using the past to help understand the future was
21:29
evolving through the time I was coming forward and has become a mantra
21:36
but nevertheless there are issues with using past climate change as
21:40
a direct analog for the future.
21:42
It’s not a direct analog.
21:43
It’s an example of how the system behaves but what was causing the system to
21:47
change in the past is not necessarily the same thing that is causing the
21:50
system to change in the future.
21:53
How things change in the future will not necessarily change in the same way because
21:57
what’s causing the change is different.
22:01
But again we continued to develop records of climate change, ice sheets,
22:06
global climate, global temperatures, sea level, and so forth and that all
22:12
nevertheless were telling us something about the system and provided if nothing
22:17
else context for how sensitive the system is to a forcing and so forth
22:24
and as my work broadened I became more involved in national and international
22:30
efforts to think about future change.
22:34
I was involved with the U.S. Global Climate Change Report on abrupt climate
22:38
change and the potential for it occuring in the future a few years ago and then
22:42
in 2012 I was invited to be involved with the intergovernmental panel on climate
22:47
change as the coordinating lead author for the chapter on sea level change.
22:53
It’s just kind of continued to evolve in terms of my interest now moving more into
22:59
the future, in fact, even though I’m a field geologist my thinking is more about
23:06
questions and thoughts about what’s going to happen in the future
23:09
and again working with modelers
23:15
to ask those questions.
23:19
So you kind of touched on this, but
23:23
do you think you have a unique perspective or framing of climate change given
23:28
your work on geologic time scales compared to say the average citizen?
23:34
Well, compared to the average citizen meaning?
23:38
Someone who doesn’t think as frequently about large-scale
23:44
trends with the earth’s history.
23:46
Sure, so I think probably the average citizen and so forth will
23:57
receive information that kinds of limited or just bits of information
24:03
from which they’re trying to understand what’s going on.
24:08
A lot of the information that they’re receiving is coming from we’ll
24:14
just say climate denialists and conservatives and so forth who don’t
24:18
believe in climate change or who don’t think it’s an important issue.
24:22
One of the things that’s often said among that group is that
24:27
well, climate change has always changed, climate has always changed.
24:32
What we’re seeing now is this natural change that the earth has always
24:35
experienced and that’s where it’s obviously a fundamentally wrong
24:39
argument but also it’s a point where with experience of how the earth’s
24:45
climate has changed in the past you can address that by saying, yes, it
24:49
has changed in the past but what’s happening now is very different from that.
24:55
You referenced ice sheets.
24:57
When did you start incorporating ice sheet as a part of your research
25:01
and can you talk about how they play a role in the global climate?
25:06
Well, basically from the beginning of undergrad my research in glacial
25:12
history has largely been on ice sheets, even though my initial
25:16
interest in glacial geology was from mountainous landscapes that had been
25:23
largely formed by glaciers, the small things.
25:27
My research interests were in the line of ice sheets, so that
25:31
was right from the beginning.
25:33
It devolved again from thinking about them in terms of past history
25:38
of ice sheets from small scale like the St. Lawrence Valley and
25:44
in the case of Torngat Mountains that was all getting at the question
25:47
of what was the ice sheet doing in those particular regions to starting
25:51
to think more broadly when I got to Chicago about the whole ice sheet that
25:56
affected North America at the time.
26:00
Then thinking about how those ice sheets had influenced climate when they existed.
26:06
Then also how they played a role in the sea level changes that had occurred and
26:14
so in terms of how ice sheets influence climate, they do so in a variety of ways
26:20
but the most important ways are first
26:27
they have a large white surface and the importance of that is that that
26:32
white surface is highly reflective of sunlight and that’s something
26:36
called albedo, which is a measure of how reflective the surface is.
26:41
If you take for example northern North America today it’s largely trees and
26:46
rocks and so forth which are fairly dark.
26:48
Now just imagine covering that with a big white mask, whether it’s
26:51
snow like we have in the winter or permanently with an ice sheet.
26:55
Now you’ve permanently changed the albedo of that part of the earth’s surface to
26:58
be much more reflective and then what that does is the earth is absorbing
27:04
less solar radiation now because it’s being reflected and that causes
27:07
cooling just through the albedo effect.
27:11
Then the ice sheets are not flat like a snow layer, they’re
27:15
very large and thick and high.
27:17
The ice sheets over North America were on the scale of the ice sheet of Antarctica
27:22
today which means they were on the order of up to 4,000 meters high or 15,000
27:28
feet high at their highest elevation.
27:29
Essentially you’re taking Canada again today, which is largely flat east
27:36
of the Rocky Mountains at sea level and you’re raising that elevation
27:41
up to about 10,000 feet and when an ice sheet grows, 10-15,000 feet.
27:48
The importance of that effect is on the way that it interacts with the atmosphere.
27:53
As the atmosphere is flow, the large Jetstream and major atmospheric
28:00
circulation encounters the ice sheet it’s going to be deflected by the ice
28:04
sheet and influenced by the present physical size of the ice sheet.
28:09
That deflection of the atmospheric circulation affects climate.
28:13
It’s the albedo effect and the elevation effect of ice sheets
28:17
that affects the atmosphere.
28:20
Then ice sheets are also a big reservoir of fresh water, so they are frozen water.
28:25
When that water melts, when that ice melts, it runs off the continent
28:29
and ends up going in the ocean.
28:30
Most of the northern hemisphere ice sheets in North America and Eurasia most
28:37
of their drainage was into the North Atlantic, so you have this fresh water
28:41
coming into the North Atlantic which is much greater than today, for example.
28:46
At times those ice sheets release fresh water in greater
28:50
amounts than at other times.
28:52
The importance of that fresh water going into the North Atlantic is it affects the
28:55
circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean.
28:58
That circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean has global effects.
29:02
If you perturb that circulation, it actually perturbs climate elsewhere around
29:06
the world just from having done that.
29:09
They influence the climate through the ocean circulation as well.
29:11
The atmosphere and the ocean are important in that regard.
29:17
Can you talk about the significance of Greenland ice sheet melting since that
29:22
comes up in the context of climate change?
29:25
So, again, two ways that, well, another factor I didn’t talk about
29:30
in terms of ice sheets, of course, is their effect on sea level.
29:33
Where the moisture comes that goes into an ice sheet is coming
29:36
out of the ocean ultimately.
29:37
If you grow an ice sheet, that means sea level has to fall.
29:39
Melt an ice sheet sea levels rise.
29:42
In the case of Greenland,
29:46
it’s a small ice sheet by comparison to Antarctica today, for example, it’s
29:50
about a tenth of the size of Antarctica
29:55
compared to the North American ice sheets, it’s, again, about
29:58
a tenth of the size of that.
29:59
It’s relatively small, but nevertheless if you were to melt all of Antarctica
30:04
today it was cause global sea level rise on average to rise by about 25 feet.
30:12
That’s still a significant amount of water that’s frozen up in that ice sheet.
30:17
It would have a big impact on sea level, global sea level.
30:20
At the same time because its location is in the north Atlantic region, then,
30:25
and this has been subject to a lot of research and this is where some of the
30:29
paleo work that I do has been relevant to thinking about this question—when
30:34
you melt the Greenland ice sheet and that freshwater goes in the North
30:37
Atlantic, is it going to affect the North Atlantic ocean circulation?
30:40
which has global effects again and so that’s been a big area of research.
30:47
Those are the two major ways in which melt in Greenland could potentially affect,
30:51
or will affect climate and society is through sea level and ocean circulation.
30:58
Earlier you referenced abrupt climate change.
31:00
Can you explain how that differs from say non-abrupt climate change?
31:06
We’re usually pretty careful to define what we mean by abrupt.
31:09
The standard definition is the change in climate occurs much more quickly
31:16
than whatever the process is that’s causing the climate to change.
31:22
You can imagine that you’re taking this glass of water and my first is causing
31:29
the position of that glass to change.
31:31
It’s changing slowly and moving at the same change and at the
31:34
same rate that I’m pushing on it.
31:36
Eventually it hits the edge of the table.
31:38
If I continue to pushing at the same rate, it falls over.
31:41
So, it falls abruptly.
31:43
The rate in which it falls is much faster at the rate in which it was being pushed.
31:48
The same is true for climate, that you’re pushing on the climate
31:50
system with change in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or change in
31:55
solar radiation or what have you.
31:57
The response to the system is to basically be what’s called non-linear
32:01
or have a tipping point type of thing where it changes much more quickly
32:06
than you would have expected from the amount that it was being pushed.
32:13
You referenced your involvement with the IPCC?
32:16
Mm-hmm [yes]
32:16
. You’ve been a coordinating lead author.
32:19
Maybe you could talk a little more about how you got involved in that and what your
32:22
experience has been like as an author.
32:26
The way you get involved is by being nominated and so for the last
32:33
assessment, so prior to the call for nominations, the last assessment,
32:38
they’re called assessments, and so the last one was the fifth assessment.
32:44
Prior to that I had been working with
32:47
a couple of colleagues, one at NASA and one at New York University on organizing
32:54
a workshop that was requested by the National Science Foundation to bring
33:01
together experts to put together a working paper, or white paper for the NSF in
33:06
terms of helping prioritize their funding opportunities with regard to understanding
33:11
ice sheets today and what we need to do better to understand them better.
33:20
We had that workshop and so one of those colleagues that I worked with from NASA
33:29
nominated me for the IPCC and he asked if I’d be willing to be nominated.
33:34
I said sure.
33:36
I was pretty surprised first that given my paleo background a lot of
33:41
my research at that point was on sea level but it was paleo sea level.
33:46
A lot of my other research had been on paleo climate from other ocean
33:50
changes and ice sheets and so forth.
33:53
They have a whole change on paleo climate, so I thought if anything
33:57
I’m going to be with the paleo climate chapter, but I ended up being
34:02
selected for the coordinating lead author for the sea level chapter.
34:06
You never know how those things, you know how the decisions are made—the
34:09
decisions are made by the committees that make those decisions but how I was
34:16
actually selected by them to be in that particular position I’m not quite sure.
34:22
I think they understood that the paleo perspective for sea level was important
34:26
and I think they saw my record as being broad and interdisciplinary and again
34:32
this synthesis type of thing that I could play a role and I think that given
34:37
the activities I’d been playing at the national level that also was a good fit.
34:41
But it was a surprise.
34:42
It seems like from how you’ve talked about it they’re inherently intertwined, but
34:47
the IPCC just breaks it down into sections within the report or working groups?
34:53
Breaks down?
34:53
The sea level and paleo climate.
34:55
Right.
34:56
They have chapters and so there’s three working groups.
35:01
The working group one that I was involved with is the physical basis
35:05
understanding of climate change.
35:08
Understanding the physical basis for climate change.
35:11
The others are mitigation and adaptation and impacts and so
35:14
forth, the other working groups.
35:16
This is working at the physical basis for climate, and so there will be a
35:19
chapter on the atmosphere, observations of the atmosphere, that we have.
35:24
There will be one on observations of the ocean.
35:26
There will be one on biology chemical cycles.
35:29
There will be one on radiative forcing and so forth.
35:34
There was one on paleo climate because again the paleo
35:37
provides this understanding about how the system behaves.
35:40
Now,
35:43
in the previous assessment report, the fourth one, they did not have a
35:46
separate chapter for sea level which was the first time because the previous
35:50
three assessments, the first three assessments did have one for sea level.
35:54
By the time of the fourth one they felt that they understood
35:57
sea level pretty well and
36:01
the basic conclusion is that sea level is going to rise but it’s going to be largely
36:06
due to warming of the ocean which causes the ocean waters to expand but that we
36:12
didn’t really have much to worry about in terms of ice sheets and we understand
36:14
Greenland pretty well and Antartica was pretty much going to be inert.
36:18
It wasn’t going to really do much in the next few centuries and so not
36:21
much of a cause of concern and so they relegated sea level down to within a
36:25
subsection of a chapter on projections.
36:30
Rather than entire chapter on sea level in terms of what’s going to happen
36:33
to it just relegate it to a little discussion about it in the general
36:37
chapter on projections which included projection of global temperature and
36:40
precipitation and everything else.
36:43
But just at basically at the time that the report was coming close the fourth
36:52
assessment report was reaching completion,
36:57
the process lasts several years and it goes through several stages of several
37:03
versions of each chapter that get reviewed and commented on and revised and so forth.
37:07
When they’re approaching the end of that process some things started to happen to
37:12
the Antarctica sheet that basically made people realize that they were probably
37:19
really wrong about thinking that the Antarctica ice sheet was going to be
37:22
inert and not really subject to change.
37:24
In fact it could change much more sooner, much more rapidly than we had thought.
37:29
But it had happened at just such a point in the progress of that preparation
37:36
of report that the way IPCC works is they assess existing literature.
37:42
They don’t do research.
37:43
They assess the literature and look at what the literature is saying about
37:48
our understanding of climate change.
37:51
There was no literature on what was going on in Antarctica.
37:53
It was just happening and so they didn’t have anything to assess it with and that’s
37:56
what the process involves is assessment.
38:00
They had to acknowledge the fact that they couldn’t take that information
38:04
in terms of using it for projections and when that was published basically
38:10
a lot of people pointed to the sea level part of it and said that the IPCC
38:16
had failed because clearly Antarctica was going to be an important player
38:23
and essentially IPCC had punted.
38:25
They had not really said much about it, but the point is they couldn’t
38:29
say anything about it because there wasn’t anything published on it.
38:32
That’s the process.
38:35
So, sea level was elevated to its own chapter again and it was probably
38:41
the most important chapter with regard to getting it right because
38:45
the other aspects certainly there had been progress, substantial progress
38:50
in our understanding about all the other things that were going on.
38:54
But it was relatively gradual, whereas sea level here was something we really need to
39:03
readdress our understanding of and get it right this time because essentially they
39:09
totally got Antarctica wrong previously.
39:12
When they realized that it was too late to do anything about it.
39:16
We were faced with then this pretty high priority thing
39:19
about dealing with sea level.
39:22
So, that was pretty exciting to be amidst all of that and nevertheless the
39:28
research that was being done and papers being published, it’s a graduate process
39:33
to do research and get papers published and so forth so the literature we had to
39:37
work with up to the point of basically the final deadline in May of 2013 or
39:44
even earlier in March of 2013 with the final report being released in September
39:50
2013 was still in its early stages.
39:55
The work that’s come out since then has moved the field along, especially
40:01
with regarding to Antarctica and Greenland to some extent, move the
40:04
field along quite a bit since then.
40:06
But it turns out that even with what we had to work with, what has since come
40:13
out has basically in my opinion just supported what we were able to conclude
40:21
from the existing literature at the time.
40:23
I feel very good about that.
40:25
In other words, while we provided information—although people don’t always
40:28
know how to read these IPCC reports correctly, and that’s not for a lack of
40:34
us making it transparent about what we’re saying it’s just people don’t read it
40:38
carefully enough, but I don’t think we’ve learned anything since then that are going
40:45
to lead us to be in for big surprises.
40:48
So, in
40:52
comparing writing an IPCC report as opposed to your scientific
40:58
research, do you feel like you’re writing for a different audience?
41:02
It sounds like it’s a different process.
41:04
It’s basically a—it’s not just a review paper, but think of it most closely like
41:12
writing a review paper because you’re looking at the existing literature rather
41:16
than collecting new data and interpreting those data and coming up with a new story.
41:22
You are reviewing the literature, but you’re critically reviewing it and
41:25
critically assessing it and you’re assessing the literature for how
41:29
robust the conclusions are and what the nature of the evidence is and how
41:35
robust that evidence is and how much consensus there is in the literature
41:41
with regard to certain conclusions.
41:43
You might have ten papers all basically reaching a very similar conclusion
41:48
and one paper that’s kind of a flyer.
41:50
It’s very, very different.
41:53
Are you going to give that equal weight to what the majority of the
41:57
scientific evidence is pointing towards?
41:59
The answer would be no.
42:01
You’re going to go more with the consensus.
42:03
To some extent IPCC has been criticized for this consensus-type of approach,
42:09
but we address those other studies but then based on the majority of
42:20
the evidence conclude that it’s more unlikely that that will be the case and
42:24
more likely that this will be the case.
42:26
And we put it in this likelihood type of thing.
42:34
I don’t remember exactly where I started from this—
42:38
In terms of who you’re writing for.
42:39
So, who I’m writing for.
42:41
It’s reviewing the literature but critically reviewing
42:43
it, critically assessing it.
42:46
Then in terms of the style of the writing and so forth there’s
42:50
no difference in that regard.
42:53
There are specific things that you need to make sure are covered for the
42:59
audience and those are things like certain language that has to be used to
43:07
reflect the nature of your findings, but otherwise it’s not that much different.
43:13
Do you anticipate being involved in future assessment reports?
43:17
They put out a call for nominations for the sixth assessment report and they
43:21
will be making those selections starting I think in February, so we’ll see.
43:27
I’d be interested in doing it again, probably not at the
43:30
coordinating lead author, though.
43:32
It sounds like a lot of work.
43:34
Yeah, the structure is that each chapter has usually two coordinating lead
43:39
authors and they basically coordinate the chapter and then there will be
43:45
anywhere 10-15 lead authors and they will have been selected because of
43:51
their specialty to cover various aspects of whatever the subject is.
43:56
Then they will write various sections of the chapter and the coordinating lead
44:00
authors will also contribute something in the writing as well, but they will
44:04
more likely be coordinating things to make sure everything is consistent
44:09
and we’re evaluating thousands and thousands of research papers and so
44:13
it’s really important that what we end up with is consistent within the
44:20
chapter and consistent with other chapters in the report and consistent
44:25
with the other working groups.
44:28
Because this is the
44:32
major instrument used for policy at the international level.
44:37
Consistency is critical.
44:38
Coordinating authors are really clued in to making sure everything is correct and
44:43
consistent, and that takes a lot of work.
44:47
How did you get involved with the U.S. Climate Change Science Program?
44:53
Regarding this abrupt climate change report I was involved with, again, I
44:56
was just asked to be involved with that.
45:01
How does that?
45:02
I’d been writing papers about abrupt climate change prior to
45:04
that, so I was on the radar, I
45:08
suspect.
45:08
How does that compare with say working with the IPCC?
45:11
This is a national, domestic—?
45:13
Yeah, this is the, so the U.S. program puts out reports of various sorts.
45:20
In this case there are a series of reports on typical studies.
45:24
This was about climate change.
45:25
They had one on other subjects.
45:27
Then every so few years they release a national assessment.
45:33
The national assessment is more parallel to an IPCC assessment
45:39
but for the nation, but
45:44
otherwise it parallels it with regard to the topics that they cover.
45:48
These more specialty reports are IPCC-like in the sense of assessing the literature
45:56
in terms of what the most robust evidence is and conclusions that you can draw
46:01
from that are with regard to the subject.
46:05
It’s, again, in the mold of IPCC but just narrower.
46:09
Although IPCC does that kind of typical thing as well as their
46:15
major assessment reports they have special reports that they call them
46:18
that they release every so often.
46:23
Now I’m going to move to some broader climate change questions.
46:27
What were your earlier conversations on climate change like and how have
46:30
these dialogues shifted over time?
46:34
So, with colleagues I think that
46:39
in the earliest days so to speak in terms of as I was coming on the scene there was
46:48
certainly a lot of discussion about it but not
46:54
at the level of interest that it’s certainly reached now and certainly
46:59
not at the amount of the number of colleagues that exists now.
47:10
When it was discussed it was more of well, maybe, maybe not, you know this was
47:19
when I got into the game it was before IPCC even the first assessment report in
47:27
1990.
47:27
There were very strong arguments about it before that certainly but still it was you
47:36
know even those studies recognized that
47:45
it wasn’t so much the greenhouse effect that if we continue emitting carbon
47:49
dioxide it’s not going to have an impact, more of the question was has
47:55
global warming started to occur yet?
47:59
I think that was unfortunate that it kind of went in that direction
48:01
because why are we debating whether or not it’s happened this year or not?
48:07
The major question is that as we continue to emit CO2 is that it’s going to happen.
48:11
But there’s a lot of interest in trying to detect whether or not that
48:15
signal of global warming had emerged yet in the temperature records.
48:22
There’s famous stories about people making those claims early on and
48:25
so forth and that maybe diverted a lot of attention to that.
48:29
I think in that regard the discussion was more like we don’t really know yet
48:33
if it’s emerged but certainly if it continues it’s going to become a problem.
48:37
But the scale of the problem, the scope of the problem really hadn’t yet
48:40
either been addressed and that’s when I think IPCC really made a huge impact
48:45
was bringing that future impacts to broader recognition and understanding.
48:54
As time has evolved and as more and more research has come along and
48:59
has things have clearly started to change, it’s become in my opinion
49:03
pretty unequivocal that the signal has emerged and at the rate we’re
49:09
going that the impacts will be large.
49:12
And I think that’s pretty much agreed upon by most of my colleagues and
49:17
as you read the reports studies of scientists who study this stuff who are
49:22
bona fide legitimate climate scientists we’re talking about 97% of the climate
49:26
scientists all have that sort of opinion.
49:31
Can you speak about the community of climate change researchers here
49:34
at OSU and how the institution maybe facilitates that?
49:42
Facilitates?
49:43
The community or collaborative work?
49:49
This is a really great university for studying not just climate
49:54
change but global change that is closely aligned to climate change.
49:59
[00:50:00
50:00
Global changes that are associated with climate change
50:04
or a result of climate change.
50:05
So, if you look at the biological sciences or forestry or engineering or
50:13
economics or policy you know you can find really strong elements of interest
50:20
and research in these aspects of climate change and its impacts on various
50:28
aspects of society and implications for policy and economics and so forth.
50:34
Much of the
50:38
study of climate change strictly speaking is in the College of Earth,
50:42
Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.
50:43
Naturally, that’s where those type of scientists reside and one of the
50:48
reasons I’m still here at OSU is because I feel my colleagues here
50:53
in this area of climate change are,
50:57
the group we have and the variety of disciplines that they
51:00
represent is outstanding and furthermore the collegiality
51:07
among us and the interest in collaboration and so forth is really great.
51:12
We have I think OSU has certainly one of the highest profile groups in the
51:20
country, if not the world, with regard to the broad variety of disciplines
51:24
covered and the expertise and so forth.
51:30
How do you foresee coping with diminished funding to climate change
51:36
during the Trump administration?
51:39
Well, it’s not clear to me that that’s happened yet.
51:44
There are certainly lots of concerns and there were right from the
51:47
beginning that it would happen and I’m not sure that it’s filtered down
51:56
yet or maybe it’s starting to but not in ways that I’ve directly seen.
52:03
It’s interesting, several of us independently got phone calls from a
52:10
reporter at NPR a few weeks ago who they looked at the number of grants
52:17
funded by NSF with climate change in them and found that those numbers have
52:22
dropped significantly since the election.
52:27
Of course they’re wondering whether or not people are trying to either the
52:30
funding’s disappearing or people are trying to hide things and so forth.
52:37
One of the major funding agencies or funding programs I go to at
52:40
NSF is called climate change, so
52:45
I know a colleague here at OSU remarked on that study.
52:49
I just told him I haven’t seen any sign of it.
52:52
Another colleague here says he has seen it.
52:55
I’d be curious to what he has seen.
52:59
It could be just that but it’s coming.
53:02
It just hasn’t really manifested itself yet.
53:04
I think we still need to be very vigilant for that and concerned about that.
53:08
It does take time for the federal process to work its way through the system.
53:13
I think though that it is the way the government is designed is it’s that we do
53:21
have some strong voices who would speak out against that as much as possible from
53:29
happening.
53:30
We’ll see.
53:33
Based on your professional experience, I guess your personal experience as
53:37
well, what policy changes would you like to see happen within the U.S.?
53:42
To address the question of climate change?
53:46
Right, right.
53:46
Well, I think the policy changes are ones of you know doing everything
53:55
possible to encourage investment and research and development in alternative
54:03
sources of energy to reduce emissions but not just to reduce emissions.
54:07
We can’t just reduce emissions, we have to get emissions down to zero because the
54:11
C02 problem, the carbon dioxide problem, and carbon dioxide is the primary just
54:17
because of the amount that we release is the primary contributor to global
54:22
warming of the various greenhouse gases.
54:24
It’s not the most potent greenhouse gas but it’s the primary one because
54:27
of the amount that is released.
54:30
The C02 problem is first of all that it causes global warming but secondly that
54:35
it stays up in the atmosphere for a long time, such that if we put in a pound o C02
54:41
today, which each of us easily does, that in 10,000 years we’ll still have about
54:47
20% of that C02 left in the atmosphere.
54:49
It just doesn’t go away very quickly.
54:52
Which means, the problem doesn’t go away.
54:55
If we reduce emissions we’re still emitting and what we’re
54:58
emitting is still staying up there and is still affecting climate.
55:02
We have to get to zero emissions and in fact preferably go to negative
55:05
emissions, where we’re actually taking C02 out of the atmosphere.
55:09
Now the reason for that is because the understanding of the impacts of global
55:15
warming now is so well-understood
55:19
and we’re starting to see them express, but we’re still
55:22
really early in the game yet,
55:26
but more and more we see those impacts
55:31
affecting people’s day to day living today.
55:35
That will just simply increase in the future and the sooner we can do
55:40
something about it then the less and less of that impact we will see in
55:43
the future, not only in people’s lives but on, well, directly on people’s
55:48
lives but through a variety of ways.
55:52
What changes to public education could help Americans better
55:55
understand climate change or possibly change to their behavior?
55:59
Hmm.
56:02
You know one thing that scientists are encouraged to do more often is get out
56:07
and speak to the public in a way that the public understands and in a way that’s
56:12
not going to scare the public because you can talk about it in ways that are
56:17
like so scary that a natural reaction is to throw their hands up in the air
56:22
and say well, what can we possibly do?
56:26
So you want to come prepared to talk about the nature of the problem and
56:29
solutions to the problem and that message is getting more and more out there and
56:36
I think it’s just at the same there is a source of misinformation that’s
56:41
out there that’s very, very active.
56:43
The public are, it’s well-known, are sort of stuck in a place of trying to
56:50
understand and decide well, who’s right?
56:54
The other side will present it in such a way that it seems exactly as legitimate as
56:59
coming from the more rational, scientific base and so I know just from talking to
57:09
people who are not scientists that that’s,
57:15
that they’re not understanding it or they’re able to
57:22
not appreciate it because they think well, so and so says it’s not a problem.
57:27
More and more of that education is needed
57:33
at a grassroots level.
57:34
It can’t be top down.
57:35
It’s got to be grass roots.
57:39
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
57:42
No.
57:47
Alright, well, that concludes our interview.
57:49
Okay good.
57:50
Thank you for your participation.
57:51
Thank you.
57:51
I appreciate your time.
57:52
Okay.
