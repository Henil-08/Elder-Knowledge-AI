00:01
Today is December 13, 2017.
00:05
I’m here with Dr. William Jaeger, a professor in applied
00:09
economics, at the Valley Library.
00:12
Today we’re going to discuss his research and global warming.
00:16
But I’d like to start out asking about your background.
00:19
Where were you born?
00:21
I was born in Seattle, Washington.
00:23
Is that where you grew up?
00:24
Yep.
00:24
I grew up in Seattle.
00:28
Went to WSU as an undergrad.
00:29
I was in the Peace Corp. In West Africa.
00:32
Went to graduate school at Stanford.
00:36
Worked at the World Bank.
00:40
Just to go back to your childhood, take a step back.
00:45
What were your interests growing up?
00:49
What were my interests?—well, I did a lot of hiking, camping
00:53
in the Cascade Mountains.
00:55
Went fishing, bicycle, a
01:02
little bit in sports but I wasn’t focused on sports that much.
01:11
Playing in the backyard in the woods.
01:14
Did you have any early interests in economics?
01:16
Did you foresee yourself going in to that field?
01:19
No, in fact in college I first declared a major in engineering, but
01:25
I had an opportunity to travel internationally and became really
01:29
interested in developing countries and sort of pointed in the
01:34
direction of economics as a tool for understanding why some countries
01:37
are poor and others are rich.
01:41
What was your school experience like growing up?
01:47
So, public school, basic public school in North Seattle.
01:55
What did you mean?
01:58
Did you foresee yourself attending university?
02:00
Did you have people encouraging you to pursue—?
02:04
Well, none
02:07
of my family had ever gone to college, but you know I was a pretty good
02:14
student and so yeah that seemed to be something that my parents thought
02:21
I should do if I wanted to and so I
02:25
followed that path, went to college but
02:29
I don’t think I really thought about graduate school until
02:36
after being an undergraduate feeling like there are things I wanted
02:39
to do where I needed more school, more skills, more training than
02:47
what I got as an undergraduate.
02:49
That’s when I started thinking about,
02:56
well, at that time I’d already sort of, I’d switched from
02:59
engineering to economics.
03:00
I did really well in economics, but I could see to use economics
03:05
in a professional way would require more than I had at that point.
03:13
That’s when I started thinking about grad school and with a focus on international
03:18
development actually, because I visited Africa and I was curious about
03:26
poverty and food problems in Africa.
03:30
Tell me more about that experience.
03:32
Was that as an undergrad or after?
03:34
As an undergrad this was one of those remarkable things
03:37
that happen almost by chance.
03:41
I had a roommate, a dorm roommate who got a pamphlet about this
03:45
program called world campus afloat.
03:48
I had never traveled anywhere at that point and I got excited about the
03:56
idea that a college student could travel, that could get on a boat
03:59
and sail around the world while they were taking classes, so I did that.
04:05
I came back and changed my major and I became sort of oriented very
04:11
differently oriented after that.
04:16
But visiting developing countries and especially in Africa made me think
04:21
about problems of underdevelopment,
04:26
of what I might be able to do in getting involved in those issues and
04:34
I came to understand that economics was a tool that could be useful in understanding
04:39
why there’s such differences in terms of standards of living around the world and
04:44
how I might in fact be able to work on some issue and contribute to alleviating
04:51
poverty or hunger, that kind of thing.
04:54
That was a motivating force for me.
04:58
Did you join the Peace Corps immediately after your bachelor’s, or was that later?
05:03
Yeah, so after that world campus afloat, I came back, switched majors and I had
05:09
an idea of wanting to go back to Africa and West Africa where they speak French.
05:14
I started taking French classes and right after college I joined the Peace Corps
05:19
and spent two years in Burkina Faso.
05:21
Actually, what’s called Upper Volta back then, but now it’s called Burkina Faso.
05:26
What kind of projects did you work on?
05:29
I worked in a village in the south part of the country which was relatively
05:34
well-endowed in terms of the climate and grew fruit trees and I was assigned
05:41
to manage an agricultural cooperative, mangoes and citrus fruits and I ended
05:46
up doing other agricultural projects as well: bee keeping, gardening,
05:52
growing potatoes to sell in the cold season to the city, that kind of
05:59
thing.
06:00
You know, I think I did some things that were useful but mostly it was a
06:06
great eye-opening experience for a young guy to go live in an African village.
06:12
Had you previously worked in an agricultural setting?
06:15
Was that a familiar environment to you?
06:16
No.
06:17
I just got, you know, I was interested in Africa and interested
06:23
in economic development and they were agricultural economies and so trying
06:30
to understand what goes on in Africa and get involved, I think Peace Corps
06:37
positions at that point in time if it wasn’t related to agriculture it
06:41
was probably working on digging wells or teaching English in the city, and
06:51
I guess some of my economics work on economic development had
06:57
involved looking at agricultural development as part of that.
07:03
So, when you came back to the States did you have a plan at
07:06
that point to return to school?
07:08
Yeah, even before leaving I had taken my GREs and hadn’t applied but had
07:15
talked to people about where to apply.
07:16
That was kind of in the plan at that point that I would come back, so I came back
07:25
and worked and applied but I had to wait until the following Fall,
07:28
so I built airplanes while I was waiting to go to grad school.
07:32
I built 747s, actually.
07:35
Not by myself—I worked at Boeing for a year.
07:44
Did you know that you wanted to pursue a Ph.D. as opposed
07:47
to a master’s at that time?
07:49
No, actually I was really interested in working in developing countries
07:56
and working at the project level, and so initially I did apply for Ph.D.
08:01
programs because that was the way to get more funding, but I had in the back
08:07
of my mind that I might just stop, do a masters and then stop, that that might
08:13
be enough for what I wanted to do.
08:14
But as I got into grad school and took courses and learned more about
08:20
research, I became more interested in the research enterprise and realized
08:27
that the Ph.D. put me in a much better position to do a broader range of things.
08:36
You ended up at Stanford, is that correct?
08:38
Yeah.
08:41
It doesn’t exist anymore, but it was called the Food Research Institute with a
08:47
focus on world food economy, agricultural development, there was demography,
08:55
nutrition were parts of the program.
08:56
It was tied to the economics program.
09:00
What was your initial impression of the institution, especially living outside
09:06
of Washington of Northern California?
09:11
The institution of Stanford?
09:12
Yeah.
09:13
Oh.
09:13
Stanford and just the cultural environment there.
09:16
Oh.
09:18
Well, you know we were so focused.
09:19
We were a group of, a cohort of 8 grad students in this program.
09:23
We were scared to death we were going to fail.
09:26
Stanford was a big, impressive place.
09:34
It was beautiful.
09:34
I mean the climate was different than what I was used to.
09:39
The whole look of the university.
09:44
There was so much going on there for undergrads, but we were in the small
09:47
grad program and the 8 of us were focused on surviving our theory courses.
09:56
Your research was on agricultural mechanization is that correct?
10:00
Yeah, that’s right.
10:02
From my Peace Corps experience in West Africa, there was this puzzle.
10:06
Why
10:09
did farmers in that region seem to reject adoption of animal-draft power, using
10:14
oxen or donkeys to pull implements to help them farm better, more efficient.
10:19
It seemed like a no-brainer.
10:22
The French and many other outsiders had come in and brought the tools
10:25
and the animals and said here and showed them how and for decades
10:30
the farmers had pretty much said thank you that’s really interesting.
10:34
When the foreigners left they went back to farming by hand.
10:38
I was able to collect data and do some analysis and better understand why for
10:45
many of them it didn’t make sense to adopt that technology but for some it did.
10:51
Were you able to return to Africa during your research?
10:55
Yeah, so I was able to very lucky to have an opportunity to join a project that was
11:02
already ongoing, farming systems research project run out of Purdue University.
11:08
My faculty, my program knew some of those people and explained that
11:14
I was looking for a way to do some fieldwork, so I went back and spent
11:20
almost two years on that project.
11:23
I was able to collect data so when I came back I had the data to do my own analysis
11:30
and dissertation, so it worked out well.
11:34
Did you teach while you were in grad school?
11:39
I did not.
11:40
I did not.
11:41
I had a fellowship, so I could focus on the two years of coursework
11:45
and I did not teach at that time.
11:50
Then,
11:53
you graduated Stanford and ended up at the World Bank, is that correct?
11:58
That’s right.
11:58
So, one of my advisors was invited to work on a research project at the World Bank,
12:05
so I worked on a project with him and a large team of researchers also focused
12:11
on agricultural development in Africa for a couple of years and I stayed at
12:15
the World Bank for a couple more years.
12:19
What was your experience like working for that institution?
12:23
Boy, the World Bank, it’s a big place at that time.
12:31
It’s an exciting place to work.
12:33
They have lots of resources.
12:34
They have really smart people, lots of economists working on projects
12:39
and working around the world.
12:44
You walk into an elevator at World Bank and there’s like six
12:47
different languages being spoken.
12:49
I
12:52
was in the research arm of the World Bank.
12:55
The World Bank is criticized and certainly some of that is
13:00
justified in pushing loans.
13:03
They’re there for a reason.
13:05
They’re there to loan money with the idea that those loans will help
13:09
stimulate economic growth and higher standards of living in those countries,
13:13
but it’s the country itself that has to pay back the loan so there’s more
13:19
risk to the country than perhaps to the young economist that thinks they know
13:24
everything when they’re 27 years old.
13:29
So, it was an exciting place to work, but I think I didn’t
13:35
want to work there long-term.
13:36
I didn’t want to stay in Washington, D.C., long term.
13:39
That’s actually why I started thinking about academia as an option because
13:44
I’d have a different lifestyle and more choices of where to live.
13:49
Were you attracted to teaching within academia or was it
13:52
more of a research draw?
13:55
You know, I didn’t really know because I hadn’t done teaching before.
13:59
My first opportunity was at Williams College where I went initially for a
14:02
two-year visiting appointment, but then that turned into a tenure-track position.
14:10
They have high expectations for research and teaching, but especially teaching.
14:15
It’s a top liberal arts college.
14:18
The students are very demanding.
14:19
You have small classes.
14:22
You have to be really prepared to teach in that environment and they
14:26
have some amazing teachers, so that was
14:31
a great introduction to what it’s like to teach
14:38
a college that emphasizes high quality teaching.
14:42
But I continued to do some research, or actually I started to do research.
14:46
I didn’t do a lot of research while I was at the World Bank.
14:49
You write reports but it’s not the kind of research you get published, although I
14:55
think maybe I had one or two publications.
15:01
I was also at that point still working on agricultural
15:07
economics and development economics.
15:09
When I went to Williams College I was asked if I would be interested in teaching
15:13
environmental economics, and that’s what led me to begin a shift toward more
15:19
environmental resource economics and away from focusing on African agriculture.
15:27
I was also a bit burnt out on African agriculture development, because it’s
15:31
kind of a discouraging topic to research.
15:34
There was at that time not a lot of success stories
15:39
and reasons to feel like you
15:44
were moving things in a positive direction.
15:47
They’re
15:49
still poor.
15:55
At Williams when your research started to shift directions, is that when
16:01
climate change started to come into it?
16:03
It did, actually.
16:05
It was interesting because the timing both for me to move to academia
16:10
and have an opportunity to teach environmental resource economics,
16:13
which I was asked if I would teach it.
16:15
I said sure and so they signed me up to teach the course and I had never even
16:19
read an environmental economics textbook.
16:23
I was just keeping ahead of the students.
16:25
I assigned a well-known textbook and I just made sure I stayed a chapter ahead of
16:31
the class, but I went to Williams in 1989.
16:35
That was the year of the Exxon Valez oil spill.
16:39
That
16:41
was the beginning, really, of a lot of things that have changed the field
16:48
of environmental resource economics.
16:50
Now we look back at the Exxon Valez as a watershed moment in the idea of non-market
16:56
evaluation, that there’s an economic value or cost when damage occurs to some natural
17:04
resource even if you don’t personally experience it, but you know about it.
17:08
It harms you when you hear about Prince William Sound being
17:12
damaged and polluted with oil.
17:17
It also was a time when climate change was beginning to be talked about
17:22
as an economic issue, where okay
17:28
if there is global warming, there are costs, but there are costs to
17:31
just trying to do something about it.
17:34
Is the remedy worse than, is the cure worse than the disease?
17:38
How do we or should we think about weighing costs and benefits as we ask
17:44
the question should society do anything?
17:47
What should we do to address climate change?
17:49
It was the early ‘90s when that really began to be a question.
17:54
There were a few people who were onto that topic earlier, but it
17:58
sort of spread within environmental resource economics in the early ‘90s.
18:05
Somewhat more generally in economics, there was an economist at Yale,
18:11
William Nordaus, who was by that time he was sort of a pioneer and
18:16
was well-known for his work on the topic, probably started in the 1980s.
18:20
In 1992 there was
18:23
a book published by an economist called The Economics of Global
18:26
Warming by William Cline.
18:29
I bought that book and read that book and that’s when
18:36
I decided that that was a topic I wanted to be involved in
18:39
because it seemed important.
18:41
It seemed like something economists needed to be engaged in, because as
18:47
we know now—at that time nobody, at that time people didn’t understand
18:52
why economists would be involved and interested in global warming.
18:56
It’s not about economics it’s about atmospheric science.
19:00
And now,
19:05
everyone talks about carbon tax versus cap in trade and international
19:09
agreements and regulatory approaches versus market-based approaches.
19:16
It’s been quite a change in terms of recognition that economics is an important
19:23
part of the discussion, of the debate.
19:30
In 2001, you came to Oregon State?
19:33
That’s right.
19:34
Why did you decide to leave Williams and move back to the West Coast?
19:41
I never warmed up to the northeast, to the east coast.
19:44
I was always from the northwest and always wanted to return and I had come
19:48
back for a 2-year sabbatical and spent to years at the University of Oregon.
19:52
My wife was from New York, so there was a negotiation there.
19:57
But I also came back and spent a year in Seattle at the University of
19:59
Washington on an earlier sabbatical.
20:03
Figuring out how I could come back to the northwest and continue to
20:09
do the kind of professional work I was interested in was a long-term
20:16
strategic planning and this opportunity opened up in 2001 so it
20:21
was great to be able to come back and
20:26
be in the northwest.
20:29
As an environmental resource economist, to me there is no better place in the country
20:33
to do this kind of work, because you have spotted owls and salmon and old growth
20:39
forests and the oceans and the fisheries.
20:42
There’s so many interesting natural resource and environmental issues out here
20:50
compared to some other parts of the country.
20:53
What were your initial impressions of OSU and Corvallis?
21:00
Well, so I spent a couple years in Eugene and I liked Eugene.
21:06
You know, I loved Seattle and wanted to get as close to Seattle as I could,
21:12
but Seattle has grown so much that in fact the Seattle I remember as a
21:17
young person doesn’t exist anymore.
21:18
It’s gotten so big and crowded.
21:20
I like the Willamette Valley.
21:23
I like the access to the outdoors.
21:25
That’s part of why I love the northwest so much is being able to go
21:29
backpacking and go to the coast and go out for a hike and all of that.
21:35
There’s all of that here.
21:38
I knew Washington State quite well and all the things to do and things to see.
21:45
I’ve been here quite a few years now, but there’s still parts of
21:47
Oregon I haven’t seen and so there’s a wonderful natural environment and
21:58
you know I actually live in Eugene and come to Corvallis two, three
22:03
days a week and work at home a couple of days a week, but I really like
22:06
Corvallis and I like Eugene as well.
22:08
I like to get up to Portland once in a while, so it’s a nice place to
22:14
live.
22:14
When you first arrived you were in the Agricultural and Resource
22:17
Economics Department, is that right?
22:19
That’s right.
22:19
What was the state of the department in those years?
22:24
Oh boy, the department has changed including changing its name.
22:28
It was somewhat larger then.
22:30
There was a coordinated university-wide graduate faculty program for economics
22:38
that included economists in the forestry school and the College of
22:42
Liberal Arts and a couple other places.
22:45
But our Ag and Resource Economics department was the biggest.
22:49
It had a very strong reputation going back a number of decades.
22:56
It was known for high-quality research and also producing some top-quality Ph.Ds.
23:06
So, being part of that department was, I was very pleased to join that department.
23:14
There have been some changes since, the breakup of that unified group.
23:21
We’re more on our own.
23:22
Right now, there’s been some ups and downs.
23:24
The program is a little smaller.
23:28
I’m not one of the younger faculty.
23:30
I’m one of the older faculty.
23:32
That’s a change.
23:34
But it’s still a very strong department and it’s a good environment for me.
23:40
Did it feel different coming to a larger school, transitioning
23:46
from a liberal arts school?
23:49
Yeah, there are some big differences.
23:50
Some pluses and minuses.
23:54
Williams College is a small,
23:59
wealthy college.
24:00
More than 200 years old.
24:04
They’ve figured out how to do things really well with a focus on teaching.
24:08
You
24:11
don’t think of it as being bureaucratic.
24:14
It’s small.
24:15
If you need to talk to the dean of faculty, you just go talk to them.
24:20
A large university is a very different environment.
24:33
There’s a large bureaucratic dimension to it, a big university, that I
24:38
didn’t have at a small college.
24:41
Part of that is a range of researchers and faculty doing things in disciplines
24:47
where I can go find someone—if I need to collaborate with someone on a particular
24:54
area fairly narrowly defined specialty, I can probably find that person here.
24:59
I couldn’t have found that person at Williams College.
25:03
Like the Geography Department, or Geoscience Department was six people.
25:11
There are those differences but
25:17
I’m glad I’m here.
25:21
How is your role as a teacher changed?
25:24
I don’t teach nearly as much.
25:26
I don’t teach undergraduates much at all.
25:29
I have a couple of graduate courses I teach.
25:32
My position is actually an unusual mix in terms of research extension with a
25:38
policy focus, which is really unusual.
25:40
It’s sort of a new kind of position that I would do—essentially what I
25:46
do is I do applied economics analysis and research with a focus on the kinds
25:53
of research and analysis that will be useful at a policy level for Oregon.
25:59
It can be water issues, land use issues, energy issues,
26:04
public finances and taxation.
26:07
I get involved in a range of issues that have some current relevance or I’m
26:13
led to believe that the legislature is going to want to have some information
26:18
on a particular topic in the next session that I might be asked or
26:25
volunteer to do some volunteer analysis and write up a document that then
26:31
will be useful to them.
26:34
That is quite different.
26:36
I’m still engaged with, I still engage with students but it’s
26:41
typically graduate students, advising them on thesis or dissertation,
26:46
teaching a couple of courses a year.
26:49
Do you like that policy element to this position?
26:54
Yeah, in fact, so most applied economists think of themselves as policy economists.
27:03
Going back to my interest in Africa and the Peace Corps, economics as a tool for
27:08
solving problems, so you use economics to understand why a problem occurs, why
27:16
we have the tragedy of the commons, why we over-pollute, over-harvest trees,
27:28
why we over-pollute the atmosphere or over-fish the oceans, well, there are
27:33
incentives at work and so economic models help you understand those incentives
27:37
and think about how one could modify or change those incentives in a way
27:42
that that would improve the efficiency of how those resources are used.
27:45
I
27:47
think almost every topic I’ve done work on it’s been where there was
27:53
a policy relevance to the work.
27:55
Yeah, I really like that.
27:57
It’s sort of what motivates me in what I do in thinking this could be helpful
28:03
to some policy maker if I contribute to our understanding of the cause
28:11
of the problem or the way that one might solve or improve the situation.
28:19
In 2007, you were a Fulbright scholar and you went to Italy.
28:23
Yeah.
28:24
What was that experience like and how was it living in Italy
28:29
and—?
28:29
It was great.
28:31
It was partly kind of a family decision.
28:34
I had a chance to go overseas and I had young children.
28:36
Exposing to someplace like Italy that was part of the equation, but I also had a
28:44
contact with a professor at the University of Venice who was well-known among
28:50
Europeans in terms of being an economist working on climate change, so he invited
28:57
me, and I applied for the Fulbright.
28:58
There
29:01
I think one of the reasons I was able to get a Fulbright because they’re very
29:04
competitive for Italy in particular is I talked about my topic of interest
29:10
and why I wanted to go to Italy and I described this visualization of
29:16
Venice, which is out there in the water and with climate change and sea
29:21
level rise we’re going to lose Venice.
29:23
It’s kind of a dramatic example of the importance of climate
29:27
change as a social issue globally.
29:29
I
29:32
lived in Padua, which is a short train ride from Venice and I went in and
29:37
I had this office down the Canal de Cannaregio with a window I could open
29:42
it up and look down on the canal and see the boats going back and forth
29:46
and it was like, it was one of those situations where you feel like you got
29:50
to pinch yourself to make sure it’s real.
29:52
Because it was quite magical to be there.
29:55
Did you teach while you were there?
29:56
I did.
29:57
I taught part of the time I was there to a small graduate—they had a program
30:04
where they taught courses in English.
30:06
There were some Italian but also students from other nations and I taught a course
30:13
on sustainability or sustainable economics or policy, I think, as I recall to a
30:20
small group of graduate students there.
30:27
It was a great
30:27
experience.
30:28
It was a good experience for your family as well?
30:31
Yeah, my kids went to an English international school, one was
30:36
middle school, one was high school.
30:39
They had a great experience.
30:40
In fact, we’ve actually gone back two more times to Italy since then.
30:45
But it was a great experience.
30:49
You’re also, it looks like you’re associated with the Environmental
30:53
Law Alliance worldwide?
30:56
Yeah, that’s a group.
30:58
It’s based in Eugene, Oregon, which only makes sense because the guy who started it
31:05
was from Eugene and his connection with the University of Oregon Law
31:09
School led to it being created there.
31:12
Their activities are focused around the world, providing support to legal advocacy
31:18
on behalf of the environment and also sort of empowering grassroots communities who
31:25
rely on environment and natural resources to protect those resources for their use.
31:32
They do amazing work.
31:34
I’m on the board of directors, which mostly means I sit back and
31:38
watch and hear about all the great things they do around the world.
31:42
How did you decide to get involved with that group?
31:46
I got involved mainly because the guy who’s the executive director,
31:50
Burn Johnson, he went to Williams College, and I got connected with
31:56
him through Williams at one point before I moved back to Oregon.
32:01
Once I was back, I think I was just interested in their work and got to know
32:07
him and got to know the organization and they asked me to be on the board.
32:13
I guess moving more into questions related to your research,
32:19
your book Environmental Economics for Tree Huggers and other Skeptics, do
32:26
you believe that the dialogue between economists and environmentalists has
32:32
improved in recent years, and if so how?
32:35
Yeah, that’s a great question.
32:37
Absolutely it’s improved.
32:38
It’s changed a lot.
32:40
The story behind that book is that those early years at Williams College they had
32:46
a center for Environmental Studies and I was involved in that program and taught
32:52
courses to those undergraduate students.
32:54
Williams also had one, had two small graduate programs, actually.
32:58
One was called the Center for Development Economics.
33:01
The economists come from developing countries for a one-year masters
33:04
program and I taught in that program, taught agricultural
33:07
development, or economic development.
33:09
As environmental issues and sustainability became more of
33:18
a catchphrase, there were some events that led someone to purpose to say we
33:24
need to teach about sustainability, sustainable development and we have
33:29
this Environmental Studies Center, we have this Development Economics Center,
33:32
what’s the connection between the two?
33:34
The connection between the two was I taught in both.
33:37
I was the only connection between the two.
33:40
I started teaching a course,
33:44
but I think what led to the book in addition to that course was at
33:50
that time it was a struggle to get environmentally minded undergrads
33:58
to recognize the importance of economics.
34:01
They were all for advocacy and economists were kind of the enemy.
34:07
The folks coming from poor countries didn’t really understand why the
34:11
environment was something they should think about, care about.
34:16
As I tried to get both of them to see the other side, I began to come up
34:21
with ways to make them understand and it went pretty well, and I started
34:28
writing up notes for those courses and those notes became chapters in a book.
34:34
That’s how that
34:37
evolved.
34:39
Where do you think that dialogue has pursued that—?
34:45
I think now most people get it.
34:47
Most people see that economics is important for the environment, incentives.
34:52
Back in those days there was a very contentious debate about whether
34:57
tradeable permits should be used to control acid rain, SO2 pollution.
35:03
It was a new thing in the early ‘90s.
35:07
Now, tradable permits, cap in trade, even using cap shares or the same kind
35:13
of concept in fisheries was viewed very skeptically and now we have these
35:18
great success stories in Alaska and Australia for how a tradeable permit
35:24
for the right to catch fish in the ocean can be a really important way to move
35:30
toward efficient use of that resource
35:37
instead of depleting it.
35:38
The connection between the economy and the environment, I think
35:40
it’s come really a long way.
35:43
It’s quite something when I think about the skepticism back in the 1990s
35:50
economists like myself faced.
35:53
It’s much, much easier.
35:54
There are still challenges.
35:56
Multidisciplinary
36:00
research has become really important.
36:03
Working with folks in other disciplines in the natural sciences.
36:07
There, there are still challenges.
36:08
The communication between disciplines is tough and sometimes you run into
36:13
some of those same obstacles of not really understanding what economists
36:19
do or why it’s important and how they can work together with us.
36:26
You kind of referenced this earlier, but I was wondering if you could
36:30
talk about cap in trade policy and
36:37
I guess contrast it with the carbon tax system.
36:40
Oh boy.
36:41
So, what the big difference is
36:47
the lesson economists have tried to get across going back to probably starting
36:52
in the 1960s, ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s that an incentive based approached was going
36:59
to be much more efficient, much more cost effective than a regulatory approach
37:04
to reduce pollution of any kind, to achieve some environmental objective.
37:09
In those days, the idea of explaining that, why these decentralized,
37:16
incentive-based approaches would get you the result you wanted in terms of
37:25
reduced air pollution rather than regulating industries,
37:34
that took a long time.
37:35
That was the focus of economists for a long time.
37:40
Whether it’s a pollution tax or a tradeable permit in cap in trade, that was
37:47
a debate that also kind of evolved over the last 20 years on a range of topics.
37:54
There are lots of reasons why in some situations why one may
37:57
have advantages over the other.
37:59
They’re both incentive-based.
38:00
Both of those approaches, those policy mechanisms could, if they’re designed
38:09
in a parallel kind of way, could both be efficient, and both achieve
38:14
the goal you want at a minimum cost.
38:19
It’s interesting how the debate among economists has shifted from I think you
38:25
know a decade ago more economists would say cap in trade is a better way to go.
38:29
I think now most economists say carbon tax is the way to go.
38:33
But the reasons for one versus the other aren’t so much in terms of the underlying
38:37
basic economics about efficiency, they’re about one being more politically
38:42
acceptable, where one self-adjusts to changes, say if there’s inflation or
38:51
other adjustments.
38:53
If there’s uncertainty, sometimes cap in trade—if you’re uncertain about what is
38:57
the optimal level of pollution, you could argue that one is better and one’s better
39:04
for short-term pollution, but for climate change where you have a very long-time
39:08
horizon the other one might be better.
39:11
There are all these kinds of detailed debates about aspects of cap in trade
39:16
versus carbon tax, but it seems like we’ve won over most people in recognizing that
39:28
an incentive-based approach is the way to go as opposed to a regulatory approach.
39:35
There were analyses done 20 years ago comparing a regulatory approach
39:41
where you just told firms how much pollution they could emit or what the
39:48
level of exhaust, or even with fuel efficiency standards and in some cases,
39:56
it was shown that the cost would be ten times as much with the regulatory
40:00
approach to achieve the same goal as with the market-based approach.
40:09
We mostly got that across as a profession.
40:13
People seem to get that now, and that’s a big step because I mean
40:19
there are still things that we still do really inefficiently, biofuels.
40:23
As a way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels or work to try to limit
40:30
carbon emissions, biofuels, corn ethanols, are a really bad idea.
40:35
It’s really inefficient and it will achieve almost nothing
40:38
in terms of those goals.
40:40
There are still inefficient policies out there,
40:45
but public understanding of some of the things that
40:53
nobody understood in the ‘90s, now the majority of people understand
40:57
you when you talk about them and people nod and say oh I’ve heard
41:00
about that, I’ve read about that.
41:03
Do you feel like biofuels are inherently problematic because they’re tied to
41:09
our, they’re trying to substitute our fossil fuel dependency or is it
41:15
dependent on the particular biofuel?
41:18
It varies by biofuels, but there aren’t any that are really good in terms of,
41:23
part of the problem is they were motivated with the idea that if we could grow
41:28
our own energy, ethanol, and if that ethanol if it’s recycled carbon because
41:36
when you plant a corn plant it takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
41:40
When you burn the gasoline, it goes back.
41:42
You could have this idea that it’s a net zero emissions.
41:46
Turns out, it’s not net zero emissions by a long way because of the fertilizers
41:50
you use and the diesel tractors and everything, but also because you use land
41:58
for growing the crops, the corn or the soybeans, that displaces food production.
42:05
That food production has to be grown somewhere else and we have over
42:09
the last 10 years models that show we devote a third of our corn crop
42:16
to ethanol now in this country.
42:18
That has significant effects on added land being cultivated elsewhere around
42:23
the world, which means clearing the land, which means disturbing the
42:27
forest and the grasslands which means lots of carbon emissions indirectly.
42:33
It’s called indirect land use change effects.
42:37
Some of those models suggest that that indirect effect on additional emissions
42:44
because land clearing is greater than what you would be saving by using the
42:49
corn ethanol even over a 30-year period.
42:52
It would take you 30 years to gain back what you lost by having
42:57
that land be disturbed in these other places around the world.
43:02
You know, people talk about second generation biofuels.
43:06
Europe’s very focused on biodiesel.
43:10
But I think over the last decade or so with more research I think most people
43:16
have come to realize that if we don’t gain much in terms of it actually reducing
43:21
carbon emissions and the cost is many times greater than other ways of trying
43:28
to reduce emissions, like raising the gas tax, that’s sort of the comparator.
43:33
That’s an incentive-based approach.
43:36
If you discourage the use of fossil fuels directly with a gas tax or
43:39
a carbon tax, we have estimates of what that would cost, trying to
43:43
achieve the same reduction in carbon emissions with some kind of biofuels,
43:50
ten, twenty times as much the cost.
43:53
It
43:55
really doesn’t make sense, economic sense.
43:59
Is a part of that, too, government subsidies of the biofuel
44:03
industry, would you say that—?
44:07
Yeah let’s see.
44:09
It could make sense.
44:10
If it really worked really well there could be a good argument for subsidizing.
44:15
There are subsidies for processing and there are some issues for the interactions
44:21
between the subsidy for biofuels with the idea of promoting the use of biofuels
44:26
with other trade policies and other subsidies for conventional crops, corn,
44:32
cotton and there’s an interaction between those policies and it’s a complicated
44:38
economic modeling exercise to try to figure out what the net effect is, but
44:47
I don’t think the subsidy, you need the subsidy.
44:51
Otherwise, most growers, most processers wouldn’t be processing ethanol.
45:06
I think the major obstacle is this problem of it not being neutral in
45:11
terms of net carbon emissions and these indirect land use change effects.
45:15
If
45:18
it did make sense, if biofuels did make economic sense on their own
45:24
and you introduced a carbon tax, well the carbon tax would be lower.
45:28
The tax on ethanol fuel would be much lower, maybe zero, than
45:33
the tax on fossil fuel gasoline.
45:36
That would provide the efficient differential that if biofuels were
45:44
a good way to avoid carbon emissions people would voluntarily do that on
45:49
their own if you had properly adjusted differential carbon tax for different
45:56
kinds of fuels it would automatically be
46:03
initiated, the supply and demand would organically grow up.
46:09
Just to clarify, a gas tax would be a form of a carbon tax?
46:14
Right.
46:17
We have gas taxes, but they’re not based on the carbon content of the gasoline.
46:23
So, if we had a true carbon tax, you’d have a different level of
46:27
tax on gasoline versus diesel, versus home heating oil or coal.
46:34
You’d across the different fossil fuels, you’d have different level
46:38
taxes and gasoline would have one level, natural gas would have a lower
46:42
level, coal would have a higher one.
46:47
A gas tax, just a tax on gasoline since such a large share of our carbon
46:52
emissions are related to transportation.
46:55
A gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon would to some degree be a carbon tax.
47:02
It would discourage the use of that particular fossil fuel energy, but you
47:09
wouldn’t want to just do that if your goal was reducing carbon emissions
47:13
because a lot of people would shift to diesel if you did just the gas tax.
47:20
The efficient way to do it would be have different gradations of
47:25
a tax on fuels in proportion to their carbon emissions per unit.
47:33
It seems like there’s that balance between addressing concerns of
47:38
carbon output but also having economically viable options for—?
47:45
Yeah, and that’s where
47:50
the political issue is and the cost issue.
47:54
That’s where the economics of weighing costs and benefits.
47:57
Does a carbon tax, is it justified given that the benefits of slowing
48:03
climate change are mostly aren’t going to occur for a long period of time, but
48:07
the cost to households who now have to pay more, that’s a very immediate cost.
48:16
How do we weigh those things?
48:17
That comes back to the benefit-cost framing of the question.
48:25
Is there an economic argument for
48:30
introducing some policy to slow carbon emissions given that it does
48:36
impose costs on the economy now?
48:44
You’ve also done research on water scarcity in the Pacific Northwest.
48:52
How do you think, or do you think Oregonians should change their
48:56
perception of future water availability?
48:59
Oh boy, perceptions.
49:01
It
49:05
varies a lot across Oregon.
49:06
It’s very dry in one part and very wet in another.
49:12
You know, in western Oregon, in many parts of Oregon water for a long
49:16
time has been thought to be it’s always there and it always comes
49:20
down the river and we just use it.
49:23
Actually, beginning the year I came to OSU in 2001 was the first time they shut
49:28
off the water to the large reclamation project in the upper climate basin.
49:34
It did not go over well.
49:36
There was civil disobedience.
49:38
There were threats to federal employees who shut that off and it had huge
49:44
ramifications and ramifications that extended to a court case that I was
49:48
involved in a few months ago, where the farmers sued the government for
49:55
shutting off their water in 2001 and they’re still fighting that
49:58
court case this many years later.
50:05
My most recent work on water scarcity in the Willamette Basin looked at how
50:09
climate change might affect water and water scarcity with population growth
50:14
and what we found was mostly good news in the sense that even though
50:18
most of the snow pack in the Cascades will not be here by the end of the
50:22
century, it’s still a pretty wet place.
50:24
There’s still rain in the spring.
50:26
For the Willamette Basin, water being available to cities and farms isn’t
50:34
probably going to change that much.
50:37
Water availability in the streams for fish and especially for the
50:40
forests and the stress on forests and diseases and wildfires , those
50:47
are probably going to increasingly be problems in western Oregon.
50:52
Then of course eastern Oregon they do rely—a lot of the institutions,
50:57
the cities and the farms that have built up they rely to a large extent
51:02
on snow that melts in the spring and the summer for that supply of water.
51:09
So, they’re going to face some pretty significant changes in decades ahead.
51:17
How do you think land values will change as a result of water availability?
51:23
How will land values change?
51:26
So,
51:31
you know Oregon’s western water law has this priority system for water rights.
51:37
You have a seniority date based on the year you started using the water.
51:41
So, a more senior water right will get water after the junior
51:45
water right gets shut off.
51:46
If there’s not enough water for both in a stream, the more recent water right gets
51:51
shut off before the water right that has a claim going back, you know, 100 years.
52:00
I don’t think there’s much differentiation in many parts of Oregon right now
52:04
between the value of a land with a senior versus a junior water right,
52:08
certainly not in the Willamette basin.
52:11
I think that’s going to change as places where water some years more
52:18
irrigators are not able to irrigate after some part of the summer goes by.
52:24
In July they might be shut off.
52:27
We’re going to see more value placed on having the senior
52:31
water right, the group that
52:36
can keep irrigating when other people are being shut off.
52:41
Complicating that is the fact that endangered species act biological
52:45
opinions require a lot of water to be left in streams for salmon and steelhead.
52:51
Those in most cases will be senior, will have a priority, over other stream uses.
53:03
Tribal water rights also will have seniority.
53:07
This court case I just mentioned, the ruling that just came out a couple
53:11
months ago was to deny the claims of the irrigators not so much because the
53:18
endangered species act was part of the reason that they were shut off, it was
53:22
the main reason they were shut off.
53:23
There was also a drought.
53:25
But that the tribes had a right to water being left in stream for their traditional
53:30
hunting and fishing uses and that had a seniority that trumped everything else.
53:43
I think some of the changes related to water
53:48
have already occurred but haven’t been occurring over the last few decades.
53:53
A realignment and changes in priorities with growth in population and income
53:59
and the evolution of people’s thinking about protecting the environment,
54:04
we’re seeing more resources
54:09
dedicated to protecting habitat ecosystems, fish
54:17
and that’s a significant change from a long period of time
54:23
where farmers and ranchers
54:28
could do a lot of things more freely than they can now.
54:35
Taking a step back, given your involvement in policy how do you view Oregon’s
54:41
response to climate change, say in comparison to the federal government?
54:47
It seems like the states on the west coast are engaged in trying to move towards
54:52
some kind of climate change policy.
54:54
There’s been active discussions in Oregon.
54:57
Washington state has had some legislation, British Columbia, California.
55:03
Given the Trump administration’s pulling out of the Paris
55:09
Accord for a global agreement,
55:13
having some states, including all the western states
55:19
clearly deciding they’re going to go forward they see that in the long term
55:23
we will have to deal with climate change.
55:24
We will have to find ways to reduce or eliminate carbon emissions, I
55:29
think that’s a very good thing.
55:31
In fact, sort of separate from that there’s a court case where a group
55:38
of children in Eugene have sued the government for not protecting the climate.
55:46
That’s been in the news recently.
55:49
A year ago, there was a court decision in November of last year and a federal judge
55:56
in Eugene made a ruling supporting the validity of the claims of these children.
56:01
That case is going forward.
56:05
There are hearings right now this week on an attempt to block it, but if that
56:10
is unsuccessful it will go forward.
56:14
And the children won in this first round the right to go to the next step in the
56:18
federal courts to sue the government that the environment, the climate is
56:24
part of protecting life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and claiming
56:30
that it’s part of the rights of the constitution and the government’s
56:34
failure to stabilize the climate is a failure to protect their interests.
56:39
That’s a very interesting court case.
56:41
There are a number of other legal actions in other parts of the country and in
56:47
other countries, but I think this one in Oregon may actually be the first one
56:52
that has gotten this far in a federal court, or a national court system.
56:58
It’s very interesting.
57:02
I’ll transition to my final set of questions on climate change.
57:07
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how
57:11
have they shifted over time?
57:13
Boy.
57:15
That’s a great question.
57:16
I’m trying to remember.
57:17
It was a while ago.
57:21
You know as an economist, as I approach it as an economist, and I
57:26
mentioned this a little bit earlier, initial discussions were about putting
57:31
it in a benefit-cost framework.
57:34
Early on the work being done, and William Nordhaus was not the only
57:38
economist doing work that was published.
57:44
I had a real problem with his analysis, as did other people.
57:48
I felt, and others felt, that he was quick to ignore so many other
57:55
things that he couldn’t quantify.
57:57
He said, okay I’m going to—nobody had even approached this issue—I’m going to
58:04
try to evaluate what would be the cost to the U.S. economy of climate change
58:10
and he had some very crude kind of how it would affect agriculture negatively,
58:15
ski resorts, this kind of thing.
58:18
Then to slow climate change if we introduce some kind of carbon tax,
58:23
what would the cost of that be?
58:25
Just focused on the U.S. economy and just focused on those parts of
58:32
the economy that he could measure.
58:35
It was so limited.
58:36
It ignored the rest of the world.
58:37
It ignored poor countries.
58:39
Of course, I early on, climate change the vulnerable people are the people I
58:46
lived with in west Africa, they will die.
58:49
You
58:52
can’t compare that to a 25-cent increase in the price of gasoline
58:56
when you’re evaluating tradeoff.
58:58
I
59:02
felt that the early economic analyses that were done, Nordhaus and maybe
59:06
one or two others, were too willing to take this very crude analysis and
59:13
claim that they conclude that we should not do anything about climate change.
59:18
The cost would be too high.
59:21
I felt strongly that they left out most of the question and answer
59:28
and I still feel that that was true and that he should have been and even later
59:34
on William Cline, I mentioned, wrote this book, Economics of Global Warming, and he
59:40
made stronger efforts to try to include more things and came to a
59:43
more cautious conclusion: well, maybe we should be doing something more
59:47
aggressively to address climate change.
59:52
Through the ‘90s things shifted, and even now Bill Norhaus is still a
59:57
leading economist on this topic, but he has much more sophisticated models.
1:00:02
He’s tried to include, he’s listened I think to other people, other
1:00:05
economists, so he’s not so quick to say we shouldn’t be doing much.
1:00:10
Now there are many other economists.
1:00:14
I guess I’m getting ahead of your question.
1:00:17
But it was a new topic.
1:00:21
These were very crude, simplistic models.
1:00:25
But you needed to start somewhere.
1:00:28
I think it would have been better if we started with these crude models
1:00:32
and then concluded, okay these are really crude models, so we can’t
1:00:36
make any recommendations or declare.
1:00:39
There was one point at which Nordhaus said, my analysis suggests that
1:00:43
$5 a ton is too high price to pay on carbon, the price on carbon.
1:00:52
I just thought there was no adequate basis for him to make such
1:00:57
a strong statement at that time.
1:01:00
We’ve come a long way and many more economists through the ‘90s environmental
1:01:08
resource economists really swarmed toward the climate change topic and
1:01:14
then there was this other work on carbon, on taxation and the use of the
1:01:17
revenues from taxation and called it green taxation of a double dividend.
1:01:22
Climate change and green taxation came together, and it was a lot of work
1:01:30
and so there’s now quite a proliferation.
1:01:33
Any conference of environmental and resource economists some
1:01:41
significant portion of the topics, of the papers being presented,
1:01:47
are connected to climate change.
1:01:53
Because it’s the biggest issue, environmental issue, that we
1:01:57
face as a planet, it makes sense.
1:02:03
You touched on the multidisciplinary environment at OSU—can you speak
1:02:09
about the community of climate change researchers here and how
1:02:12
the institution facilitates that?
1:02:14
Well, on climate change—I think that having the Climate Center that Phil Mote
1:02:22
heads up is a good thing for Oregon State.
1:02:24
I think he seems to be a really good director and he tries to promote
1:02:31
research and information dissemination on the topic because so much, you
1:02:38
know, among developed economies the United States is the only country in
1:02:41
the world that is opposed to doing something aggressively on climate change.
1:02:46
Europe has been waiting for many years for us to get our act together and join
1:02:52
the rest of the high-income economies.
1:02:57
It does seem to be a significant part of it is Americans have been exposed to
1:03:02
a very different set of facts and some misinformation, but there’s a lot of
1:03:11
still hesitancy to believe climate change is really occurring, that it’s caused
1:03:14
by humans, and that it’s going to be a big deal, that it’s going to be costly.
1:03:21
Doing more to get that information out there and to get the science
1:03:26
understood by the general public I think that’s really important and I
1:03:32
know the Climate Center here at OSU is involved in trying to do that.
1:03:39
They are occasionally on the radio talking about the latest
1:03:45
aspect of climate change policy.
1:03:52
They seem to be well-connected with the College of Earth,
1:03:55
Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.
1:03:59
I worked with them on this Willamette Water Project and I’ve gone to present
1:04:04
that work at there’s a Northwest Climate Conference that many people
1:04:08
from OSU are involved in and it was in Tacoma a couple months ago.
1:04:13
It’s an annual conference and Phil Mote used to be at the University of Washington
1:04:17
and much of the climate research is at University of Washington and here at OSU.
1:04:21
I think you have a good critical mass in the region and there are researchers
1:04:27
in Idaho as well who from what I can tell, I’m not a climate scientist,
1:04:32
but they do some of the best work.
1:04:37
Even nationally I think they’re well-recognized
1:04:39
for their climate research.
1:04:42
Are you concerned about funding cuts to climate change research, and if
1:04:48
so how do you anticipate coping, I guess, for the next four years?
1:04:51
Yeah,
1:04:58
I am concerned.
1:04:58
I think it seems like it’s going to be a problem.
1:05:01
I know some people are
1:05:05
strategizing by taking the words climate change out of their grant
1:05:09
proposals and using temperature variability or some other term.
1:05:18
My own research the next couple of years is going to be focused more on water
1:05:22
irritation and a couple of other projects,
1:05:26
but certainly I would expect if
1:05:34
I were to want to get involved in another project that required grant
1:05:39
funds, yeah that’s probably—from what we know about this administration’s plan.
1:05:48
But it’s also true for EPA for interior department funding research, even, I
1:05:54
think the National Academy of Sciences is probably going to be affected.
1:05:57
So, when we’re in an environment which, you know this kind
1:06:04
of thing has happened at
1:06:08
some level this kind of thing comes and goes but I’ve never seen
1:06:14
a situation where there’s such an all-out assault on knowledge.
1:06:19
Facts are the enemy if they lead to a conclusion that is opposed to your
1:06:26
agenda, then facts are the enemy.
1:06:29
By
1:06:32
blurring the distinction between the media and fake news, between science and some
1:06:40
kind of pseudo-science or non-science
1:06:45
it really is a threat to everything we do.
1:06:49
All of us here at the university who teach and do research we’re
1:06:52
in the knowledge business.
1:06:54
So, this is a threat to knowledge, not just about climate change
1:06:58
but at every level it’s a threat.
1:07:02
What kind of policy changes would you like to see happen in the U.S.
1:07:06
with respect to climate change?
1:07:08
With respect to climate change?
1:07:16
Well, I think even if we had a different administration, even if
1:07:20
we had a democratic president, I think getting aggressive carbon tax
1:07:28
legislation and aggressively promote the Paris Climate Treaty I think it
1:07:36
still, because of the dimensions of the climate change problem, because it’s
1:07:43
global, it’s so long-term, the costs
1:07:49
to reduce carbon emissions to stabilize the climate the costs
1:07:53
are now and the benefits are far in the future, most of them,
1:07:59
I think it’s even going to be a challenge if we had a different
1:08:06
administration in this country and to some extent that’s true of
1:08:09
many countries around the world.
1:08:15
One piece of my current research is working on a paper
1:08:18
on climate change policy.
1:08:23
That analysis, which I’ve been working on for a couple of years now and I’m
1:08:27
trying to get it down leads to a pretty pessimistic conclusion about that
1:08:35
policy process through the kind of thing that started with the Kyoto Agreement
1:08:41
and is now sort of the Paris Accord.
1:08:48
There’s theoretical research, there’s empirical research.
1:08:52
There are a lot of ways that you can look at this as an example of a
1:08:55
kind of problem and ask have we ever solved a problem like this before?
1:08:59
Well, we’ve never had a problem quite like this before, but we’ve never
1:09:03
solved one that came anywhere close
1:09:08
given that to stabilize the climate is different than say
1:09:15
reducing air pollution in a city.
1:09:18
If you don’t reduce air pollution in the city this year you can try next year.
1:09:22
You can delay.
1:09:24
Delays don’t necessarily
1:09:30
make the problem go away.
1:09:33
If your solution is delayed, you can still solve it.
1:09:37
You just solve it at a later time.
1:09:39
With climate change, if we don’t get our act together in
1:09:41
the next couple of decades,
1:09:45
stabilizing the climate relatively close to where the climate is now
1:09:51
that goal, there’s a window of opportunity for that goal and if we
1:09:56
end up doing too little too late then that objective can’t be achieved.
1:10:03
It’s gone.
1:10:07
That is pretty pessimistic, but I think that’s a pretty clear-eyed
1:10:11
look at the evidence from the literature that I’m familiar with on
1:10:15
international environmental treaties, on some of the work by Elinor Ostrom
1:10:20
on common pool resource management.
1:10:23
The legal litigation approach that I mentioned with this case in Eugene and
1:10:31
there are some in other countries in Europe and elsewhere I think something’s
1:10:38
going to have to happen there in terms of—and it can be kind of a domino, if
1:10:44
one or more countries makes a ruling that says yes the government has an
1:10:48
obligation to stabilize the climate or work towards stabilizing the climate,
1:10:52
that can have a spillover effect in other countries and I think that’s actually the
1:10:56
way that—that combined with some kind of international treaty like whatever happens
1:11:07
after Paris, I think that’s the way we might be able to stabilize the climate,
1:11:20
introduce aggressive policies over the next 2, 3 decades to do that, but I really
1:11:27
think that that—essentially changing the property rights, having our legal
1:11:37
system say yes you do not have—one group of individuals does not have a right to
1:11:44
change the climate and enforcing that is the duty of government and government
1:11:50
has not upheld their responsibilities.
1:11:55
A judge can make a ruling that can lead to some pretty dramatic
1:12:02
and aggressive changes that would
1:12:09
reduce carbon emissions and we really need to go to zero
1:12:12
carbon emissions pretty quick.
1:12:14
The scenarios that show the trajectories, if we’re going to stay within the
1:12:19
two- or three-degree centigrade rise,
1:12:25
we don’t have much time.
1:12:27
Given that if you look—the first attempt at a climate agreement, Rio
1:12:32
and then Kyoto and then Copenhagen and then Paris, that’s been 25 years
1:12:37
and we have nothing that’s binding.
1:12:39
There’s nothing been achieved except promises.
1:12:42
We don’t have another 25 years.
1:12:48
What changes to public education could help Americans better understand
1:12:54
climate change or change their behavior?
1:12:56
That’s
1:12:59
not my field, education, but
1:13:04
it’s very clear that people believe very different things and I have seen enormous
1:13:13
changes in people’s understand of the importance of the environment, wetlands.
1:13:20
In my youth, wetlands were something you filled in because all they did
1:13:23
was create mosquitoes and I think the general public understands how
1:13:28
important wetlands are and so how
1:13:34
we change people’s understanding, it might have been in elementary
1:13:38
science classes’ fieldtrips.
1:13:40
I think those kinds of things are incredibly influential.
1:13:43
I was involved many years ago I was asked to come out to Oregon
1:13:48
and come to Tillamook with a group that promoted improving pedagogical
1:13:58
tools related, in this case it was related to environment and it was a
1:14:04
2-day workshop and I was asked to go along and talk about economics but we
1:14:11
got on this bus and went out to a stream where we walked and we saw a place with
1:14:16
these steelhead or salmon were spawning.
1:14:19
We could see them.
1:14:19
We could see them arranging the gravel.
1:14:23
They were endangered species.
1:14:24
Those species were on the endangered species list.
1:14:28
I thought wow what an amazing thing if you could teach that kind of stuff
1:14:34
and bring kids out to see something like that, I think that can have a
1:14:39
lifetime effect on kids recognizing and learning about and being interested
1:14:45
in the natural world around them.
1:14:48
I think it has to be done,
1:14:53
not just in elementary school but entire grades and somehow the
1:15:00
general public, the adult population.
1:15:04
I’m
1:15:07
not sure what the way to do it is but efforts to get the general
1:15:15
public to understand science better and to appreciate the role of
1:15:24
the natural environment
1:15:29
and protecting the
1:15:34
system we depend on is pretty important.
1:15:38
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
1:15:44
Am I hopeful?
1:15:55
I’m not hopeful for this international process through
1:15:58
Paris, the Paris Agreement.
1:16:04
I would like to think that if it’s laid out in that sort of legal context that
1:16:10
I described there are enough judges out there who will see themselves as
1:16:17
being in a position to save the planet and they will make the right decision.
1:16:25
I mean, I don’t know how to judge the probability, but if I was going to count
1:16:32
on something happening that’s going to
1:16:38
change the trajectory we’re on, it would be those court cases.
1:16:45
You know, we will do something.
1:16:48
We will slow carbon emissions, I just think we’re going to be
1:16:51
doing it way too—if you look at the Ebola outbreak in Africa.
1:16:57
We finally got our act together to send people over there when
1:17:00
it was already diminishing.
1:17:01
The height of the epidemic was over.
1:17:06
As a society we’re good at too little too late, and in the case
1:17:10
of climate change that means we’re not going to stabilize the climate.
1:17:13
We’re going to just slow its gradual increase in temperature unless either
1:17:20
this sort of litigation approach can be successful and then be leveraged
1:17:25
to a global agreement or there’s some kind of breakthrough in technology
1:17:30
for a non-fossil fuel energy source.
1:17:34
Solar and wind are becoming much cheaper and more widely used.
1:17:40
But we kind of need a breakthrough in the next 10 years if we’re going
1:17:44
to see—if we got a breakthrough, everyone would stop using fossil
1:17:48
fuels if something else was cheaper.
1:17:51
We’ve seen dramatic shifts in the use of technology in the past.
1:17:55
But
1:17:58
there’s no way to know how likely that is.
1:18:05
Well, we’ve reached the conclusion of the interview.
1:18:08
Thank you for your participation.
1:18:10
I appreciate your time.
1:18:11
You’re welcome.
1:18:12
Absolutely.
