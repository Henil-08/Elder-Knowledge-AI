00:01
Today is December 21, 2017.
00:04
I am here with Dr. Andreas Schmittner, a professor in the College of Earth,
00:09
Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at OSU.
00:13
We are in the Valley Library and we’re going to be talking about
00:16
his research, particularly as it pertains to climate change.
00:20
But I like to start with your background—where were you born?
00:24
I was born in Germany.
00:25
That’s where you grew up?
00:27
Yes.
00:28
What was it like growing up in Germany?
00:34
Well, I was growing up in a small village of 1,000 people in the center of Germany
00:43
and you know it was country life there.
00:48
What did your parents do?
00:50
My mom was at home and my dad was working for the German
00:59
telecom, so in the phone company.
01:03
It used to be a government, owned by the state, the company.
01:10
Did you have an early interest in science as a child?
01:14
No, I did not have an early interest.
01:17
In fact, first I wanted to become a musician initially and only later
01:22
changed my mind and studied physics.
01:30
What was your academic experience like growing up as a child, in particular?
01:38
As a child,
01:42
well, I was in Germany at school and then my parents moved to Iran, to Tiran,
01:49
for two years where we lived there.
01:51
I went to German school there and then back again to Germany
01:57
and then I went to high school.
02:01
What was that experience like living in Iran?
02:04
It Iran it was quite an experience.
02:06
We lived in a part of Tiran the capital of Iran that no other foreigners were.
02:16
We were amongst the Iranians there and I learned to speak Farsi, the
02:22
Iranian language, and I played with the kids on the block, but now I
02:30
have forgotten all of my Farsi.
02:34
Did you have any mentors or was there an expectation within your family for
02:39
you go to to university after school?
02:42
No, in fact neither of my parents had gone to university, so I’m the
02:48
first in the family, but there has not been an expectation of that.
02:53
I think they were positively surprised.
02:57
Did you go to university immediately or did you do other things before that?
03:07
I did other things before that.
03:11
I told you that I wanted to become a musician but I did not have any
03:14
formal education or I hadn’t practiced an instrument for a long time, like
03:22
typically students of music do.
03:25
I took a year out after high school for which I wanted to prepare
03:31
for the music admissions program.
03:34
You have to do a test to be admitted to the program.
03:37
But already after a few months it became clear that I could never accomplish it,
03:44
but I still had to take the year off.
03:48
In Germany also at that time we had to do military or civil service,
03:54
and I chose the civil service.
03:55
I was doing that for two years after high school.
04:00
After that this year off and after that I started physics in the physics program.
04:06
What was it about physics that attracted you?
04:10
I don’t know.
04:11
I guess my first thought was I wanted to do what I liked to do, which was music.
04:18
Then my second thought was maybe I should do what I’m good and I was good at school
04:23
and physics and math and I also thought maybe I can do something useful there.
04:35
Did you have any experience with undergraduate research?
04:39
With undergraduate research?
04:40
No, I didn’t.
04:44
What influenced your decision to pursue further studies, or graduate studies?
04:50
Well, maybe I should take that back because I remember
04:55
I went as an undergraduate to the Alfred Wegener Institute.
05:02
At that time I started physics in Giessen near the town where I grew up near
05:10
Frankfurt in the center part of Germany.
05:12
Then I moved to northern Germany to Bremen.
05:18
Then there was the opportunity to do an internship at the Alfred Wegener
05:22
Institute which is in Bremerhaven at the North Sea, and there doing polar
05:29
research and that’s how I got into contact with earth sciences essentially.
05:38
I did a little project there on sea ice modeling and that was
05:43
my first contact with the field.
05:48
You went to the University of Bern is that correct to study your Ph.D.?
05:52
Yes, that’s right.
05:53
In Germany I first did a diploma thesis that involves already kind of a
05:59
scientific research work for one year which was at the Alfred Wegener Institute
06:07
in Bremerhaven on arctic atmospheric processes, in fact, I was working
06:12
there and after that I moved to Bern in Switzerland where I did my Ph.D. That
06:20
Ph.D. was then moving towards the ocean where I’m still working on right now.
06:26
What was it like moving to Switzerland from Germany and what language
06:32
did you take your courses in?
06:35
The Ph.D. program does not have any courses, so essentially it’s
06:42
different from in America where you take classes, but in Switzerland and
06:45
Germany essentially you’re done with your classes and you only do research.
06:50
You write a thesis.
06:52
I didn’t take any classes there but the language is German as well in that part
06:58
of Switzerland where I was in Bern.
07:04
The German that the regular people speak is quite different.
07:09
It’s Swiss German.
07:11
It’s quite different from the regular German.
07:13
It took me about a few months to get used to it and to be able to understand
07:19
everything that people are saying.
07:23
Can you talk about
07:28
what the physics perspective brings to your kind of research studying the ocean
07:34
as opposed to say an oceanographer?
07:39
The physics perspective I think
07:44
is broader than oceanography in the sense that it includes
07:51
atmospheric processes or ice processes as well.
08:03
Your research was on the atmospheric hydrological cycle and influence
08:08
on global ocean circulation?
08:10
Right.
08:11
The waterway transport in the atmosphere and how that
08:15
affects the ocean circulation.
08:19
At that time my Ph.D. thesis was already about the planetary scale, so
08:24
the largest scale ocean circulation.
08:26
That’s sometimes called the great conveyer belt and that involves sinking
08:33
of waters at high latitudes in only certain regions of the world’s oceans
08:39
where this sinking takes place, and then the waters move at depth to
08:43
different places where they up well.
08:45
That sets up this global overturning circulation and
08:49
that has a specific pattern.
08:50
For example, waters sink in the north Atlantic, but they do not sink
08:56
in the north Pacific, even though it’s also similarly cold there.
09:02
The reason that the sinking takes place in the north Atlantic and not in the north
09:06
Pacific is related to the salinity of the surface waters whereas north Atlantic
09:13
waters are salty in the north Pacific.
09:15
They’re fresher and therefore they are less dense, because salinity also
09:18
impacts the density of sea water.
09:22
Sinking only happens in the north Atlantic because the Atlantic is
09:25
salty and the atmospheric hydrological cycles, or the atmospheric water
09:29
cycle, determines the salinity differences between the ocean basis.
09:38
The atmosphere transports water vapors, so water evaporates in the Atlantic and
09:42
then it is transported via the trade winds in the tropics to the Pacific
09:47
where it precipitates and that is one process that makes the Pacific fresher.
09:53
You would expect there’s also water vapor transport at midlatitudes
09:56
from the Pacific to the Atlantic because there we have westerly winds.
10:01
But the Rocky Mountains are in the way so
10:07
the water rains out
10:11
and doesn’t reach the Atlantic and the combination of these processes, water
10:17
vapor transporting the tropics from the Atlantic to the Pacific but this blocking
10:21
of waterway vapor transport from the Pacific to the Atlantic at midlatitudes
10:27
this makes the Atlantic saltier than the Pacific and then that creates,
10:32
that sets up that pattern of deep ocean circulation that we currently have.
10:37
Were you creating of computer simulations or models?
10:43
Yes, that was my work at Bern.
10:45
In my Ph.D. I was working with very simply zonally averaged ocean model that only
10:52
has one good box across the whole basin from east to west and in the Atlantic
10:59
but we had separate grid boxes in the Pacific so we could model the Atlantic
11:04
and Pacific separately from each other.
11:07
Those were very simple models at that time.
11:10
Was anthropogenic climate change a part of your research at that time?
11:16
It was, even though initially when I came into the Ph.D. thesis I had not
11:21
even heard about anthropogenic climate change, so I was doing this out of
11:27
curiosity to learn about the earth system.
11:32
My supervisor there, Thomas Stokkar, he was already aware of climate change
11:38
and that it may impact the ocean circulation and in fact that had
11:42
been an influential paper published earlier by Manabe & Stouffer who said
11:49
that global warming could lead to a slowdown of this overturning circulation
11:56
and we followed up on that with a simple model, so we explored that.
12:04
Did you teach at all as a Ph.D. student or is it just research-based only?
12:09
It was mainly research, although I remember we did some lab
12:16
supervising students that did physics labs.
12:19
I assisted with that.
12:23
After you were done with your degree you took a postdoc position at the University
12:28
of Victoria in Canada, is that correct?
12:30
That’s right.
12:31
How was that transition like moving halfway across the world?
12:36
Well, it was exciting.
12:37
It was great.
12:41
I met my wife in Bern in Switzerland and she also came with me to
12:47
Canada and we really enjoyed it.
12:50
Victoria and British Columbia is a beautiful place.
12:55
Also the research group there was very good and my supervisor he was super.
13:01
He was very generous and also he gave me essentially complete freedom to
13:07
do what I wanted to do, which you know, has happened for a researcher.
13:14
I could explore my own ideas and
13:19
I also worked with a somewhat more complex model, a three-dimensional
13:22
ocean circulation model.
13:24
In fact, the same model I’m working with today so
13:30
that’s kept some continuity from that point of my postdoc years is
13:38
the same model we’re still using.
13:40
Although, we’ve much developed it and improved it from the time
13:46
when I was doing my postdoc there.
13:50
Why did you decide to return to Germany after that postdoc?
13:56
Well, the postdoc ran out.
13:57
A postdoc is temporary.
13:58
At some point
14:02
I had to look for other job opportunities.
14:07
I applied for a few positions, faculty positions, which didn’t work out and
14:11
then I got the offer from Germany, so we went to the Max Planck Institute there.
14:17
Did your research focus shift during your postdoc years?
14:21
Did you take it into a different direction?
14:25
Mm-hmm [yes] . When I was a postdoc in Victoria, I was still
14:33
very much focused on the physics.
14:36
But I became interested in paleoclimate and what happened in the past,
14:42
and the issue became that when we tried to model the past ocean,
14:53
if we have a physics only model that only has temperature, and
14:56
salinity, and velocities in
15:00
it, there’s only very little data that we can use the compare the model to.
15:04
Most of the paleo oceanographic data that there is lots of data that exists, but
15:10
most of it is based on biological proxies.
15:16
For example, carbon isotopes measured on little tiny shells of vermin and
15:22
frill that live on the sea floor.
15:23
That gives us information about the carbon isotopic signature of the water but if
15:31
you have only temperature, salinity, and velocity in your model which is
15:36
the basic physics that is in there, you don’t know how that would affect
15:41
the carbon isotope of the water, so
15:48
I noticed that it is very difficult to compare and validate the model results
15:54
with real data from the sediment even though lots of lots of data exists,
15:58
but just the incompatibility with the kind of data with what we had with
16:03
the physical model was the issue that
16:07
we had.
16:08
When I came to Jena, I came into contact with people who had experience
16:15
more with the biological side of things and this was at the Max
16:20
Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry,
16:26
I started collaborating with them and
16:32
they gave me a code of a simple ecosystem model and I plugged it into the physics
16:39
model of the UVic, the ocean circulation model, and I had very quick success after
16:44
maybe a week or so after a few days it was running and I could produce plots and
16:51
maps of productivity in phytoplankton, which is very exciting to me.
16:58
So that got me fired up and enthusiastic and even though it took many more
17:05
years to really calibrate the model correctly and make sure everything
17:09
was working as good as possible.
17:13
That was a start into the more biological and chemical components.
17:21
Since then we’ve developed the model to include full ocean biogeochemistry
17:28
carbon cycle, oxygen nutrient cycles.
17:31
That was a major part and very important important part of my career to branch
17:41
out into these biogeochemical processes.
17:44
It sounds like you synthesized different models or code from different models.
17:51
Do you write code as well?
17:53
Yes.
17:55
That was a very similar code that we received, just a four tracer:
18:00
nutrient, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, called NPDZ models.
18:06
We’ve built upon them and expanded it.
18:10
Now we have more phytoplankton groups.
18:14
We also have not only one nutrient that we had at that time but we
18:19
have phosphate and nitrate and also iron now included in the model.
18:29
We’ve been developing it to make it more realistic,
18:35
to include more processes that really happen in the real ocean.
18:43
After your time with the Institute of Geosciences with the University of
18:48
Kiel you came to OSU, Oregon State?
18:52
Yes.
18:52
How did you decide to come here?
18:56
What was that decision and transition like?
19:00
Again, my job at Kiel was temporary so I had to look for other opportunities
19:05
and I knew that here at College of
19:12
Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences was at that time they were looking for
19:17
a climate modeler so I met Peter Clark at a meeting and asked him
19:23
are you still looking for somebody.
19:25
He said yes.
19:26
So, I applied and it worked all out.
19:29
I was very happy.
19:31
What were your initial impressions of the university and Corvallis in general?
19:36
Since we were in Victoria before we knew the west coast.
19:40
So, we liked it there and we also like Corvallis for the same reasons.
19:47
It’s
19:49
just the quality of life here, the nature is so close by, lots
19:58
of hiking trails and you’re close to the ocean.
20:01
You’re close to the mountains.
20:02
It’s a wonderful place to live.
20:07
How has your role as a teacher changed through your career?
20:12
Well, I haven’t been teaching very much but when I came here teaching
20:17
is part of my job, even though it’s a relatively small part.
20:21
It’s only about 1/3 of my time teaching, but
20:29
I had to learn and I think I’m still learning.
20:33
I’m still kind of improving my teaching.
20:38
You teach a class on global warming?
20:41
Yes, an undergraduate class.
20:42
How has teaching that class changed from when you first started to now?
20:49
It has changed quite a bit.
20:52
I
20:56
tried to make the class more interactive.
21:00
Initially it was more of a lecture only class.
21:06
Even though it’s still based on lectures, I try to include more interactive
21:11
components to it because I feel like I want to know what the students think so
21:21
getting feedback from students helps me improve my teaching, otherwise I don’t
21:25
know what they learn or what they think.
21:31
I introduced a few things that made the classes more interactive.
21:37
For example, I introduced student summaries in which I asked a few
21:44
students to recapture what we did in the last lecture and so at the
21:50
beginning of each lecture the students recapture what we did last lecture.
21:55
That way we come up to the state where we are, and we remind everybody where
21:59
we are, but I also get the feedback from the students what they understood from
22:03
last lecture and what was not so clear so we can go over things that remain
22:07
unclear from the last lecture again.
22:11
You recently published an open source textbook on climate science.
22:14
Mm-hmm [yes]
22:15
. Why did you choose an open source format?
22:18
Well, I feel textbooks are expensive and
22:24
I just wanted to take that expense away from students that are
22:30
already have high tuitions to pay.
22:32
That was my motivation, and also to make it accessible to
22:38
as many people as possible.
22:40
Open textbook can be accessed by everybody, not only students.
22:49
Now I’ll move more to questions related to your research.
22:54
Can you talk about how you used nutrients to model ocean cycles?
22:57
You kind of touched on it earlier, but
23:02
in bringing nutrients into your models—
23:10
Nutrients in the ocean are required by phytoplankton to grow and
23:20
so the ocean works a little bit different than land.
23:23
Land plants also need nutrients, like you fertilize your plants
23:28
at home to have them grow better.
23:32
But in the ocean it is tricky because the phytoplankton have to
23:36
live at the surface of the ocean because that’s where light is.
23:41
The absorption of light by water essentially makes the deep ocean dark.
23:48
Photosynthesis can only happen at the surface at the top
23:50
essentially 100 meters or so.
23:54
That means in order to do photosynthesis phytoplankton have to be small,
23:59
they have to be floating on top.
24:02
If they were like trees they would sink to the bottom and if there was no
24:05
light they couldn’t do photosynthesis, so that’s why they develop into small
24:13
algae that float near the surface.
24:17
But still there’s a food web.
24:20
The algae are eaten by zoo plankton.
24:22
Zoo plankton get eaten by fish.
24:24
Some of the detrital material, like fetal pellets for example they sink
24:29
in the water column and that leads to removal of nutrients from the surface.
24:35
Nutrients and carbon are removed from the surface and sequestered in the deep ocean.
24:42
If there was no process that bring back those nutrients to the surface,
24:48
the phytoplankton would just starve and they could not grow any more.
24:52
But the circulation, the turbulence in the ocean, so the physics essentially,
24:59
brings some of the nutrients in the subsurface back to the surface and allows
25:05
phytoplankton to grow, productivity, and makes the whole food web possible.
25:13
Why couple
25:17
ocean and climate cycles together?
25:21
Well, the ocean is an important part of the climate system.
25:26
The large heat capacity of the ocean is very important for climate.
25:35
The ocean also transports heat from one region to another region and this global
25:42
overturning circulation that I mentioned at the beginning is part of that.
25:46
It removes heat from the southern hemisphere, puts it into the northern
25:50
hemisphere and it makes the north Atlantic, for example, relatively
25:53
warm compared to the north Pacific.
26:02
From a physical point of view, the ocean is very important for the climate system.
26:06
But the ocean is also important from the biogeochemical point of view because of
26:12
the process that I mentioned earlier, the sinking of organic matter to the deep
26:19
ocean, that is called the biological pump, because it removes carbon from the surface
26:24
and the atmosphere to the deep ocean.
26:27
So it makes the atmosphere have less CO2 than it would have otherwise.
26:35
Essentially it keeps CO2 levels relatively low in the atmosphere and
26:40
because CO2 levels impact climate, through the greenhouse effect,
26:46
that also then impacts climate so the ocean biology and biogeochemistry
26:52
impacts climate through the carbon cycle.
26:57
What are difficulties in coupling these cycles together with respect to making
27:04
projections about future climate?
27:07
Well, the interactions between the biology and the chemistry and the physics is
27:13
one of the difficulties and the biology itself is so complex and diverse.
27:23
There’s so many different kinds of phytoplankton and zoo plankton that
27:27
food webs are complicated, so it is not straightforward to model that
27:34
and put that into a global model,
27:39
but with all models we have to simplify and the way do it currently
27:46
is just we have a few groups that we call phytoplankton functional
27:54
groups, like for example diazotrophs
27:59
that can fix nitrogen or diatoms that require silicone as a
28:06
nutrient or other phytoplankton.
28:11
We try to model these individual groups that are functionally different,
28:18
but we cannot model each individual species of phytoplankton just
28:24
because of computational limitations.
28:29
Even with those plankton functional groups, the ecosystem
28:36
models become quite complex.
28:39
We started as I mentioned earlier in Jena I started with
28:41
four tracers: the NPZD model.
28:44
Those have four prognostic tracers.
28:47
Prognostic is what we call those that we calculate explicitly at each time
28:52
step and each grid point in the model.
28:55
Now we have expanded the model to have 30 prognostic tracers because we not
29:01
only include the biological tracers
29:06
let’s say in terms of carbon or nutrients, we also included isotopes,
29:10
which adds to the total number of traces we keep track of in the model.
29:16
You may imagine that if we have 30 prognostic tracers they are
29:20
all interacting with each other or they’re flux is from one to the other.
29:24
It becomes quite complicated, so the code also becomes quite complicated.
29:31
You mentioned the ocean, or deep ocean, as a carbon sink?
29:35
Mm-hmm [yes]
29:37
. Does human caused increase in carbon or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, does
29:47
that change that carbon cycle between the atmosphere and ocean and does that
29:52
change the deep ocean as an ocean sink?
29:57
It does.
29:58
Since global warming changes the circulation of the ocean, it also changes
30:05
the carbon cycle because the circulation is important for the carbon cycle.
30:10
As I mentioned earlier, the circulation brings up nutrients for the phytoplankton,
30:14
so if you stratify the ocean more, which is what global warming does.
30:22
Global warming warms the surface first.
30:27
That leads to more stable stratification.
30:33
We use that word to indicate that it is more difficult to mix the surface with a
30:38
subsurface, so there will be less mixing of the surface with the subsurface.
30:43
It’s like if you have a bathtub and you just put warm water at the surface,
30:52
then that warm water, because it’s more buoyant it would stay at the
30:55
surface and would not mix with the underlying water unless you stir it up.
31:02
That is the same thing as happening in the ocean.
31:04
The surface warms also at high latitudes it becomes fresher
31:07
because there is more precipitation.
31:11
All of these processes lead to less mixing between the surface and the subsurface and
31:16
that decreases phytoplankton productivity because there’s less nutrient input into
31:21
the photic zone, into the upper ocean, and it also changes how the circulation
31:30
affects the carbon cycle, like this large-scale overturning circulation.
31:33
We know that global warming will slow this circulation down.
31:39
In fact, it is already measured to be slowing down right now.
31:43
There are the first indications that we’re seeing right now
31:45
that early model projects during
31:49
my Ph.D. for example, that Manabe & Stouffer were the first
31:52
who projected that to happen.
31:54
Now we see the first indication that it’s in fact, indeed happening.
31:58
It’s slowing down and that slowdown will affect the carbon cycle.
32:03
There’s no doubt about it.
32:07
How does that slowing down affect the climate, or, climate cycles, I guess?
32:15
Does it have a dramatic impact on weather, for example?
32:22
Well, it can.
32:25
We know that the overturning circulation not only affects climate in the north
32:30
Atlantic, so the movement of near the surface of waters from the tropics
32:37
to the high latitudes in the Atlantic warms the north Atlantic relatively.
32:42
That’s why Europe is relatively warm.
32:45
If you slow that heat transport reduces, so it will affect
32:50
clearly climate near Europe.
32:55
But the overturning also affects the tropics.
32:57
We know that at least for large changes in the overturning that the intertropical
33:03
convergence zone responds currently because of this circulation that makes
33:08
the northern hemisphere a little bit warmer than the southern hemisphere.
33:12
The intertropical convergence zone, which is the band of high precipitation near
33:17
the equator is just north of the equator.
33:19
It’s just a few degrees north of the equator, but if that circulation was
33:24
stopped or reduced dramatically, then that ban would shift to further south.
33:31
Either at the equator or just south of the equator.
33:41
The evidence for this is not only from models but also from paleo data that
33:47
have shown that link between the ocean circulation and the intertropical
33:51
convergence zone in the past.
33:54
We’re pretty sure that this is a robust process and if the ocean circulation was
34:01
to dramatically reduce, we would expect the intertropical convergence to shift.
34:06
That would mean large shift in rain bands in the tropics, which would affect many,
34:10
many people and ecosystems in the tropics.
34:17
As a scientist you have an active public voice on Twitter and the
34:23
Climate Change National Forum.
34:26
Why take on this active role?
34:29
Well, I think the general public needs to be more informed.
34:35
My feeling is that climate science needs to be better
34:40
explained to the general public.
34:44
There is
34:49
what the public thinks about climate change and whether or not it is
34:55
caused by humans, for example, is much different from what scientists think.
35:00
I go to conferences a lot and there is no question.
35:04
It’s a very rare to meet a climate scientist and there are only
35:08
very few that doubt this or that kind of play this role down.
35:16
Essentially almost all of climate scientists agree that climate change
35:21
is caused by humans, the global warming we’re seeing currently.
35:25
Whereas in the popular, the general public only I think half of the general public or
35:31
so or maybe a little more, but much less than the percentage of scientists believe
35:37
that global warming is caused by humans.
35:41
I think it’s important to convey that message to the public because if we don’t
35:49
believe that climate change is caused by humans then we don’t do anything about it.
35:55
If it’s not our fault, we don’t need to do anything about it.
35:59
But it is our fault.
36:01
We are to blame for it and there are also important consequences
36:07
if this goes on in the future.
36:09
It will have dramatic impacts if it goes on unchecked.
36:14
So, in order to avoid this we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
36:20
In
36:22
order to come to that conclusion you first have to understand
36:25
that it’s caused by humans.
36:30
I just want to contribute to reduce this
36:37
discrepancy between what scientists think and what the public thinks.
36:41
I think there’s a lot of, I think, deliberate misinformation in the media
36:49
about that topic and I just want to counter that and try to
36:55
bring the science to the public.
37:00
What has your experience been like communicating scientific
37:04
information to non-scientists?
37:06
Has it made you think about language differently, or—?
37:11
Yes, and the undergraduate class that I’m teaching most of them are
37:15
non-science majors, so that is helpful.
37:20
In fact, the class is also helpful for my research.
37:24
I think there is a nice kind of feedback.
37:28
When you teach or try to explain the big picture you also
37:36
get more aware of the big picture.
37:39
Usually when you do your work you’re focus on the little details.
37:42
Of course the little details are important but the big picture’s also important.
37:46
Sometimes you can lose sight of the big picture when you work on the details.
37:52
Communicating and teaching brings back that broader view, which I think is
37:59
important for a scientist to have.
38:03
I don’t know if I was answering your question or not.
38:06
Yeah, it does.
38:07
I’m going to move to some broader questions on climate change.
38:13
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how
38:17
have they shifted over time?
38:20
The earliest conversations—I
38:25
guess that must have been during my Ph.D. time in Bern.
38:30
I think at that time
38:35
it became clear that climate change is happening and that it
38:40
may have serious consequences.
38:43
It
38:45
was not so much in the public perception yet.
38:51
That changed with for example Al Gore publishing his or making his movie An
38:58
Inconvenient Truth, and other things that brought it more to the public.
39:06
But I was mostly interested in the science so I was not really much interested in
39:12
following the public debates about it, but I know that in Germany or in Switzerland
39:19
at that time there was no doubt that the scientists were not doubted.
39:26
There was not a pushback like in the U.S. When I came to the U.S. I noticed
39:31
that there was so much pushback against science and scientists that I felt
39:38
that was not happening in Europe.
39:41
There may be a little bit of that but it’s much, much worse here.
39:47
Have you thought about why maybe what would influence that
39:50
discrepancy or cultural difference?
39:54
Well, that’s hard to say.
39:56
I think
40:03
there may have been this polarization happening here that
40:07
is partly responsible for that.
40:10
Kind of the group thinking and so that you know if you just only listen
40:15
to a certain kind of news or media that perpetuates these lies, in my
40:24
opinion, or these misinformations
40:27
then you just believe that and that is much less happening in Europe.
40:35
Then maybe in the U.S. there is a larger
40:44
mistrust of authority in general, so that people
40:52
are much more suspicious of
40:59
government and
41:02
authority than maybe in Germany or in Switzerland.
41:08
Can you speak about the community of climate researchers here
41:12
at OSU and how the institution facilitates collaborate environment?
41:19
When I came here I was new to the U.S. system so I didn’t know
41:24
anything about how to write grant proposals and how the system works.
41:30
I was really very fortunate to be
41:34
welcomed into a group of paleoclimate scientists that were working together
41:40
at that time in preparing a large proposal and they immediately trained
41:44
me in the process and helped me with understanding how the system works and
41:52
so
41:55
I was very fortunate in that regard and
42:01
that helped me a lot also to write my own proposals, to get
42:07
started here in a new situation.
42:09
CEOAS also in general is very collaborative.
42:14
People work together rather than against each other and that is just
42:20
a wonderful place to be because if you have a question about something
42:24
you can just knock on people’s doors and say hey, do you know about this?
42:30
Usually as scientists they are happy to help and talk about
42:37
what their interests are.
42:42
How do you foresee, or do you perceive having to deal with or cope with funding
42:50
cuts to climate change research in this particular political environment?
42:58
I hope not, but I think one has to expect
43:07
something like that may be possible.
43:09
So, yeah.
43:12
I mean in past republican administrations funding for climate
43:18
science was not cut, but in the present administration we don’t know.
43:24
Everything seems possible.
43:27
But I hope not.
43:29
Now it is certainly there’s lots of open questions and things we need
43:39
to know about the climate system.
43:43
What kind of policy changes would you like to see happen within the U.S.
43:49
relating to climate change?
43:51
Well, I hope that the U.S. gets back into the Paris Agreement.
43:56
I think that was a positive step by the Obama administration.
44:00
I was really hopeful at that time when that decision was announced.
44:06
Withdrawing from it I think was a mistake.
44:10
We clearly need to reduce carbon emissions.
44:13
The whole earth does it.
44:14
We’re the only country that is not in the Paris Agreement at the moment.
44:19
I hope that we get back to reason and back into that agreement and
44:26
into collaboration with the whole world to try to address this problem.
44:34
You’ve touched on communication earlier, scientific communication, do
44:39
you have any other thoughts on changes to public education that could help
44:44
Americans either better understand climate change or change their behavior?
44:50
Yeah, I don’t know.
44:51
I guess it would be good if the topic was taught not only in the
44:56
university but also already in school.
44:59
I think it’s happening.
45:00
I’m not sure how broadly it is taught in school, but I think it would be important
45:06
to teach about it at all levels.
45:10
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
45:16
I am hopeful.
45:17
My
45:21
hope or despair changes.
45:25
Sometimes I’m more optimistic.
45:26
Other times I’m more depressed.
45:28
It’s an up and down depending on events.
45:34
Well, that concludes our interview.
45:37
Thank you for your time.
45:38
Thank you.
45:38
I appreciate your participation.
