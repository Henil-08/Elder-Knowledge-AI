00:01
Today is January 10, 2018.
00:04
I’m here with Dr. Allen Thompson with the School of History, Philosophy, and
00:08
Religion at Oregon State University.
00:11
We’re at the Valley Library.
00:13
Today we’re going to be talking about his research as it relates
00:16
to global warming, but first I’d like to start with your background.
00:19
Where were you born?
00:22
Elizabeth, I was born in Chicago, Illinois.
00:24
Is that where you grew up?
00:26
I grew up in the suburbs north of the city.
00:29
What did your parents do?
00:31
My dad was a corporate attorney.
00:33
He still is alive but retired, a corporate attorney working on
00:39
international loans for business operations and my mother was largely
00:44
a homemaker, I would say, but she also has done a lot of things: worked
00:47
in a bookstore and took a nursing degree while we were growing up.
00:53
What were your early interests as a child?
00:58
I don’t know.
00:59
Early interests as a child: I did some sports like most kids did.
01:04
I played football and lacrosse.
01:07
I guess when I was really young, sort of pertinent to this, I really did
01:11
imagine when I was probably under 10, it was a lot like war games.
01:15
We built machine guns out of old pieces of lumber and run around in
01:20
the woods, rolling and tumbling and stuff like this and thinking that,
01:25
imagining World War II or Vietnam or something like that, fantasies.
01:28
I guess I was sort of interested in that, wearing camouflage, stuff
01:35
like that.
01:35
Did you spend time outdoors or have a relationship to nature as a child?
01:40
We did a lot of camping as kids outdoors.
01:43
We would go down to—a friend of the family had a farm, a co-op owned farm outside
01:53
of Galax, Virginia, I guess that is southwestern Virginia along the New River,
01:57
and we would ride horses there and do some camping along the Appalachian trail.
02:01
I think Mount Rogers there is the highest point in the Appalachian trail,
02:04
we would do that pretty regularly and went out west and did camping.
02:07
Also we had a pretty big backyard, much of which was forested or the edge of which
02:13
was forested and continues with forested adjacent yards and we would play in there
02:18
and build forts and that sort of thing and then also there were ravines coming down
02:25
in the suburbs there down to Lake Michigan which we were near, which were a nice sort
02:30
of natural areas as far is I could tell.
02:33
You could drop off the road and climb under the bridge and drop
02:36
down into the ravine and find old street signs, or this thing or that.
02:39
There was always a creek at the bottom and we would spend a lot
02:41
of time running around in there.
02:44
What was your school experience like?
02:46
Did you anticipate going to college or have people in your
02:49
life encouraging you to do so?
02:51
Yeah, most definitely.
02:52
The kind of background that I came from everyone was expected to go to college.
03:00
I think 95% of my high school all go to further education, higher
03:06
education of some kind or another.
03:07
Although I was a terrible high school student.
03:10
I tested very well and I was in advanced classes in the sixth, seventh, and
03:17
eighth grade and I suppose it’s puberty somewhere in there that hit and I just
03:20
started wanting nothing to do with school and I just started giving up on doing
03:25
any of the work and I barely graduated high school and I did not get into any
03:30
of the colleges that I had applied to, although I was conditionally accepted
03:36
at this one school I was interested in.
03:38
Perhaps these were your other questions lead to about where did you go to college,
03:42
things like this, at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington which is
03:46
an alternative school founded in 1968 or the late ‘60s, something like this.
03:50
No grades.
03:51
No tests.
03:52
Interdisciplinary—you take one course at a time with 3 or 4 different professors.
03:56
There’s no departments.
03:57
There’s no tenure for the faculty, there’s only a BA or a BS for the undergraduate
04:02
level with as I think I said no majors.
04:06
You’re really allowed to design your own education.
04:08
It was alternative.
04:09
That was good for me.
04:14
At the same time, I was living in a group house with a lot of kids who were far
04:20
more liberal, at least had experiences in liberal lifestyles like following the
04:25
Grateful Dead and big hippies on a farm and stuff like this than I had had from a
04:30
rather conservative, suburban experience.
04:34
There was also a big education going on there in terms of a young
04:37
person growing up and being exposed to a lot of different things.
04:40
Did you have an area of emphasis of study there?
04:46
Kind of along those same lines, did you do any undergraduate research?
04:49
Yeah, I guess to back in some ways I didn’t answer your question.
04:51
We were expected to go to college and I wasn’t admitted
04:54
anywhere but it was conditional.
04:56
It meant I came there that summer and performed well and was also on probation
05:01
during the fall and everything went fine.
05:05
I did a great books program the first year, sort of more traditional thing,
05:10
and I did some art appreciation and then largely I just started
05:13
putting together philosophy areas.
05:16
I knew I wanted to do philosophy.
05:17
As I had been skipping school in high school I was sort of under the
05:23
wing of the Dean of Students at Lake Forest College which was the local
05:28
college I lived a couple blocks from.
05:30
He was a
05:32
sort of a failed Jesuit priest and he’d left that lifestyle but knew a lot
05:40
about religious thinking, interdisciplinary educated,
05:45
cross-religious and philosophical ideas.
05:48
He was a Jesuit and they get a good philosophical education.
05:50
It was kind of a new age without all the crystals and everything and we
05:53
went to these adult evening classes between Highland Park and Lake
05:57
Forest, and Highland Park is largely a Jewish community and Lake Forest is
06:01
largely a Catholic community and so
06:07
well-educated housewives, largely, who were the audience for these adult
06:11
evening classes and I would go and take them with a couple friends when I
06:16
was supposed to be doing homework for math that I wanted nothing to do with.
06:19
We studied Aquinas and Anselm and I learned about meditation
06:23
with him over at the college.
06:26
Then I got interested—I was reading William James and some David Hume
06:33
some things, learning about a number of classic European philosophers with
06:38
him and through one-on-one meetings.
06:41
Then when I went into college I sort of self-identified as a philosopher.
06:44
Like I said I took these great book programs and the door was open there for
06:48
me to say hey you three other students you want to read this book on Descartes
06:54
or something like that and then we’d find an instructor and just do it.
06:59
It was self-guided research, largely, and sometimes programmed around classic
07:05
western philosophical issues and persons.
07:10
You decided to pursue graduate studies after that experience at Evergreen?
07:14
I did.
07:15
I thought at the time I might want to go into anthropology.
07:19
I was pretty interested in the human experience and human beings.
07:23
I was not getting a very rigorous classical training in the different
07:28
disciplines or anything like this.
07:29
It was all this cross-disciplinary stuff.
07:31
I thought it was all philosophy.
07:33
But my philosophical mentor who I’d been working with mostly said you know
07:38
you’re pretty much a philosopher: the questions you ask, the stuff you’ve
07:41
been reading, the stuff you’re into is pretty much philosophy, not anthropology.
07:44
The methods are different there.
07:46
You should think about philosophy more.
07:47
I said I okay.
07:48
He said well you have some talent.
07:50
This was in
07:54
the early ‘90s, ’90
07:57
or ’91.
07:58
He said you have some talent doing this.
08:00
He had come of age in the late ‘60s where there was a tremendous expansion
08:04
in the universities and came out there were a lot of jobs available to him.
08:08
He had a one-year position at MIT and then moved out to this experimental college.
08:12
So, his views on these things were a little out of date and he said you have
08:18
some talent why don’t you apply to the top 10 programs and you’ll probably get into
08:21
one and you’ll go do philosophy there.
08:23
I said that’s great.
08:25
So, I applied Princeton and Harvard and Stanford and like
08:28
Brown I think and University of Pittsburgh and all these places.
08:33
The other part of the plan was go up to the University of Washington 60 miles
08:37
up the road in Seattle immediately as a non-matriculated graduate student,
08:43
which is a limited number of courses.
08:44
You’re not enrolled in a degree-seeking program but
08:47
you’re allowed to take credits.
08:49
I studied that summer and the next fall to get letter grades on my transcript,
08:53
because otherwise I had this 180-pages of written self-evaluations and faculty
08:57
evaluations and stuff like this, get some letter grades, show that you can
09:01
do graduate work in philosophy and get one more letter of recommendation from
09:05
someone who teaches graduate students.
09:08
That was the plan then go apply.
09:10
I applied to the UW, University of Washington, as a back-up plan and
09:14
like getting into other things it was just none of these other places wanted
09:18
someone from the hippy school who had been doing whatever they wanted.
09:21
You know what I mean?
09:23
I didn’t fit the mold.
09:24
I couldn’t write in the same way that I’m sure the—they take
09:27
people with much higher pedigree.
09:29
So, I got in of course to the University of Washington where they’d seen that I
09:33
could perform and took my graduate degree there from the University of Washington.
09:38
I paid for my first year out-of-pocket, didn’t have any funding, but they
09:43
liked what I was doing so they started giving me graduate teaching assistant
09:47
appointments for my second year.
09:49
I had those then throughout the remainder.
09:52
I got a master’s degree in two years in that program there.
09:57
I believe still, but at the time, you didn’t write a master’s thesis.
09:58
You wrote three papers that
10:02
would be publishable in three different areas:
10:07
ethics and value [ethics and aesthetics], mind and
10:16
epistemology, and what was the other one?
10:18
I forget the other—history!
10:19
History of philosophy to show some breadth and they would be scored each
10:24
by three different faculty and you get a certain number of points and
10:27
you have to chart a certain number of parts for different outcomes: released
10:30
with no grade, asked to revise and resubmit, or given a terminal master’s,
10:36
or invited into the Ph.D. program.
10:38
I was one of four of the twelve people that came in with me who
10:41
was then invited to continue as a Ph.D. student there, which I did.
10:46
What did you think of being back in a more formal academic,
10:51
or institution, environment?
10:51
It was pretty good.
10:53
I enjoyed it.
10:54
I think that, like I said, I alluded to earlier, my writing I think was a
10:59
little bit more simplistic in a way.
11:01
There’s styles of academic writing, largely that’s what I do to keep
11:05
my job, that are sort of arcane but they’re very specialized.
11:10
They want a certain kind of voice for a certain kind of audience
11:13
and I was looser than that.
11:16
I had to work hard on doing that.
11:18
I had to get up to speed on a lot of the formal logic to pass the advanced logic
11:22
class, the sort of metalogic stuff, but I very much enjoyed having a bigger group
11:30
of people who were really interested, sort of exclusively, in western philosophy.
11:35
As you know, they were largely diverse hippies at Evergreen
11:40
where I was an undergrad.
11:42
How did you enjoy teaching?
11:46
I liked it a lot.
11:48
I was the teaching assistant.
11:49
Once you pass your preliminary exams for the Ph.D., they can
11:53
give you your own classes where you’re the primary instructor.
11:56
I enjoyed it.
11:58
I taught introductory ethics courses at the primary instructor and I
12:01
taught logic, formal logic, courses and then informal reasoning courses.
12:07
Your research—is that where you started to focus more on environmental ethics at
12:12
that point or environmental philosophy?
12:14
It’s not.
12:17
I was working on a dissertation.
12:19
I was trained in metaethical
12:22
theory and normative ethical theory, largely theoretical considerations
12:28
and I wrote a dissertation defending a particular no-Aristotelian view
12:34
by Phillipa Foot and her 2000 book, Natural Goodness, something or another.
12:38
It was really a very straightforward theoretical sort of things.
12:41
I went on the job market several times looking to just apply to all
12:44
ethics jobs, which is a big category.
12:48
But through the course of my graduate career I had some
12:52
interest in environmental ethics.
12:53
At that time it was not taught regularly, and I worked with one of the faculty
12:57
there, Robert Coburn, metaphysician Robert Coburn, who was on my graduate
13:01
committee designing an environmental ethics course to put on the permanent
13:07
course catalogue, and I was the first person to teach that class and it still
13:12
exists up there under the same name.
13:13
They run it more regularly now.
13:16
In fact, they’ve hired people to do environmental ethics.
13:18
It
13:20
was new at the time and my experience with what I keep calling the hippies
13:27
at Evergreen, as you can imagine involves a lot of considerations about
13:31
vegetarianism, social justice, there’s considerations of environmental justice,
13:37
the well-being of non-human animals, destructive practices of logging in the
13:41
Northwest on the spotted owl, which was all going on then, earth-first activism.
13:46
There was a lot of environmental stuff in the mix.
13:48
We lived on a farm growing organic food.
13:51
I had this sort of stuff in my background.
13:57
Yeah, so actually in ’99
14:01
I was spinning my wheels I thought working on my dissertation and teaching
14:05
for the university but not making a lot of progress in this new Aristotelian
14:08
dissertation, so I had an opportunity because of a strange automobile accident I
14:14
had been the victim of in ’92, I had some resources, some money, and I bought in
14:22
on a piece of land cooperatively owned by old deadhead friends of mine in Southwest
14:26
Colorado, outside of Durango, north of Bayfield near the Weminuche Wilderness
14:31
near Lake Vallecito and surrounded by BLM land you had to go through.
14:36
I lived in a yurt out there from ’99 until 2003,
14:43
left my pursuit of the Ph.D. and thought I would do something else.
14:48
Was off the grid, five miles from a paved road, living in this yurt.
14:52
We had a market garden and we had some well, 7,500 feet [altitude]
15:00
.
15:02
I made a non-profit, an educational non-profit and we thought we would
15:06
bring in Durango area school children for 2 or 3 overnights and show them
15:12
gardening and putting their hands in the dirt and we’d get an ornithologist
15:15
to talk about the birds or wildlife watching and I would give little talks
15:18
in environmental ethics sort of stuff, campfire talks to the little kids.
15:23
But there’s another group in Durango called Durango Nature Studies that already
15:28
had grant writers on staff, you know, and you can imagine I had the greatest
15:33
organizational skills of this group of deadheads with dreadlocks and you know
15:39
doing other things so that we’re swamped.
15:42
We’re out-competed by these guys and I had met the woman who would later
15:46
become my wife and in the interim we got married over the Y2K and into those
15:53
and we’re going to have a baby and I started seeing my only marketable skill
15:58
was doing philosophy and teaching.
15:59
So I finished my dissertation, hustling to do that before our son came.
16:06
We moved off that land and into town in Durango and I was working part-time for
16:12
Fort Lewis College, which was a four-year liberal arts school in the state system.
16:17
Did a couple years just contingent faculty, adjunct stuff, finished my
16:21
Ph.D. They liked me very much and they gave me a full-year appointment.
16:26
With my degree I started calling myself a visiting assistant professor,
16:29
but that’s a little inflated.
16:31
A fellow in political science—a joint appointment between philosophy and
16:37
political science, denied tenure.
16:39
I thought this is where I will get a job.
16:41
You know it’s a tough job market and I’ll stay here.
16:44
But there was no funding to rehire me as an adjunct the next year.
16:48
There was no funding.
16:48
They didn’t do a job search, so I had to go on the job market after that.
16:53
I’m not sure what your next question will be—probably along those lines.
16:56
I’m trying to track how the environmentalism came into it.
17:01
Then I got a one-year appointment at Virginia Commonwealth University doing
17:05
ethics, ethical theory, for them.
17:08
I drove the whole family across the country.
17:09
We just moved.
17:10
We sold our little house and we moved to Richmond, Virginia for a year
17:15
and then next year I went on the job market again and I would apply for
17:18
environmental ethics jobs, which were a small percentage of ethics, normative
17:22
or metaethical theory, so smaller pool.
17:28
I could tell them not only that I put this class together and I could
17:31
speak to the things they wanted.
17:32
Then I would start telling them about these 3 years that I lived
17:35
in the yurt at 7,500 feet altitude off-grid where the bear had tried
17:41
to get in my yurt, a mountain lion jumped over my—all this kind of stuff.
17:45
Their eyes kind of get wider because it sort of screams authenticity in a way and
17:52
sets me apart from the other candidates.
17:55
That landed me a tenure-track job at Clemson University doing environmental
17:59
ethics where I was for six years and then an opportunity came to apply for this
18:07
job at Oregon State University, which I thought honestly at the time I was only
18:12
going to apply—we thought we’re making our stand down in South Carolina at
18:17
Clemson and I thought I would just get an offer and use that as leverage for my
18:22
dean there to get a retention, a raise, because that’s one of few ways to get
18:26
a bump up in your salary in academia.
18:30
But they flew me out here for the on-campus interview.
18:32
Of course, you know, it’s drizzling rain and I’m coming down in the hut shuttle
18:35
from Portland down here you see the mountains and there’s like a rainbow.
18:39
I was like oh, my God.
18:40
The northwest, this is where I spent many formative years in my young adulthood.
18:46
I thought I’ve got to get this job and we have to come here.
18:50
I’m really in.
18:53
They liked the story of living in the yurt too and hired me
18:56
to do environmental ethics.
18:59
The six years and then I’ve been here seven years doing environmental
19:03
ethics but trying to bring all the time my underlying virtue metaethical
19:08
views to bear on the questions regarding the natural environment.
19:13
When did global warming enter your research?
19:16
That’s a good question.
19:17
It was there early on in those early environmental ethics books
19:21
but did not dominate the discussion in the way that it does today.
19:24
There’s a lot more interest just in—we faced a kind of environmental
19:29
crisis after World War II.
19:32
It was recognizable that the human impact was growing much larger and the
19:37
progressive social movements of the baby boomers included environmentalism, but
19:42
the issues really then were framed about species loss and loss of biodiversity
19:45
and pollution and so you get the great pieces of American environmental
19:51
legislation, like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species
19:54
Act all passed almost unanimously by a unified congress to fight these things.
20:00
Then only in I think it was ’98, maybe it was ’88.
20:06
I think it was ’88 famously, I can’t remember, when James Hansen, the chief
20:12
scientist for NASA’s Goddard Institute, very famous climatologist here in the
20:18
U.S., chief climatologist, said he was 99% sure global warming was real.
20:22
We’re seeing the effects of it and that sort of stuff.
20:24
It just trickled.
20:26
Then with the ’92, with the Rio Summit and the initiation of the UNFCCC—early
20:35
‘90s you start getting international political recognition around that
20:38
and it goes very slowly since then, but of course in some ways it swamps
20:41
all these other issues because of the enormity of the problem for all future
20:45
human beings and that sort of thing.
20:48
It trickled then, as it were.
20:52
What were your initial impressions of Oregon State, of the
20:56
institution and your department?
20:59
I am a product of
21:03
state institutes of higher education.
21:05
Evergreen’s the Evergreen State College.
21:07
It’s a public school.
21:09
University of Washington is a public school.
21:11
Clemson is a public school, sort of South Carolina State University, teaching job.
21:16
Virginia Commonwealth is a state school where I taught.
21:18
Fort Lewis College is a state school.
21:21
I’m at home with the nature of the institution.
21:25
It’s a land grant institution.
21:27
Here we have a great resource, a tremendous college of forestry.
21:31
We’ve got good fish and wildlife.
21:33
The oceanography program.
21:35
You have all these atmospheric modelers and scientists here.
21:39
You’ve got all of the kind of people who are making cutting-edge scientific
21:44
work on the natural environment which are wonderful colleagues to have to do
21:49
the kind of interdisciplinary work I was trying to do as an undergraduate.
21:53
But then when you work as a philosopher, really when you get trained to do it,
21:56
largely you write and you think alone.
21:58
You’re engaged with this literature.
22:00
But environmental ethics is really an interdisciplinary program because
22:03
instead of just thinking about
22:07
theoretical questions that only philosophers think and being stuck
22:10
in the literature of philosophy, in a small group of other philosophers, you
22:14
have to find out about the politics of those annual CUP meetings of the UNFCCC
22:19
and atmospheric science and what’s going on in the cutting edge there
22:23
or restoration ecology and issues in changing ecosystems there and so I can
22:28
talk to those people across the campus.
22:30
I had a strong impression and thought it would be a good place to
22:32
continue the work that I am doing.
22:35
How has your role as a teacher evolved through your career?
22:40
I teach environmental ethics regularly.
22:42
That’s a kind of introductory course that talks about its emergence in the
22:46
20th century largely starting as an academic discipline in the early ‘70s,
22:52
thinking about non-human animals, extending traditional theories and
22:58
thinking about species or ecosystems as a whole and then other kind of issues.
23:04
I teach that regularly.
23:05
I teach intro ethical theory and it’s pretty plain teaching that
23:10
I do, which is nice because it allows me a lot of opportunity
23:13
to work on the specialized work.
23:14
I have to read all this other literature I’m not an expert in to begin with
23:18
to do this interdisciplinary work.
23:21
Then to diversify my teaching, I do specialized upper-division courses in
23:25
climate ethics or novel ecosystems that I work on or ecological restoration,
23:33
more as one-offs usually with a small mix of graduate students from these largely
23:41
biological, earth science disciplines and some philosophers and try to have that
23:46
dovetail with things I’m researching and writing on so that it can help support it.
23:52
I guess moving more into your research, how do you frame moral
23:56
responsibility in global warming?
23:59
Now to get to the heart of the matter in some ways, responsibility is a
24:09
complicated concept in the kind of philosophy that I do is interested in
24:13
just doing conceptual analysis like that.
24:15
Our paradigms, paradigm cases, our received notion of responsibility
24:21
largely has to do with liability, would I would call backward-looking,
24:27
holding persons responsible for, or accountable for, actions that they have
24:33
performed which cause harms wrongly in specific cases to specific other
24:40
individuals that are specifiable, right?
24:43
I swing my fist unjustifiably and I hit you and I knock out some
24:47
teeth, or something like this.
24:48
Or I steal your bicycle out from under you and then I’m caught and I’m
24:52
responsible for damages you suffer due to my actions that I alone have
24:57
caused and that’s the kind of notion of responsibility that we have, right?
24:59
We hold our children responsible.
25:02
So this notion moral responsibility designed for making sense of our
25:07
giving praise or blame for actions and then rewarding or punishing and
25:13
fitting in to some sort of story there.
25:17
That’s different than causal responsibility.
25:20
The wind might blow and be what is responsible for the lamps moving from
25:27
the table onto the ground and breaking.
25:28
The wind blows.
25:29
We say well the wind is responsible, but we don’t thereby praise or blame the wind.
25:35
We don’t hold it morally responsible.
25:37
We don’t admonish the wind.
25:38
It doesn’t make any sense, right?
25:40
But other human beings are the kind of entities, the kind of agents that we
25:45
think have a freedom that legitimately are the bearers of responsibility
25:49
constrained in one way or another by youth or other conditions, right?
25:54
Incapacity, insanity, being drunk, being raised by drug
26:00
addicts or under harsh conditions.
26:03
We mitigate the kind of responsibility we hold to them,
26:05
but we hold ourselves responsible.
26:08
With global climate change what we recognize is that the fundamental form
26:13
as a massive collective action problem.
26:17
No one of my actions as an individual—flipping the lights on
26:21
or off conserving energy, setting my thermostat here or there, what kind of
26:24
car I drive, the fuel efficiency it is, drive or bike, what I put on my plate.
26:31
For example a lot of meat eating has a greater impact on my diet, has a greater
26:38
impact on my personal carbon footprint.
26:40
The kind of car I choose to buy.
26:41
Things like that.
26:42
Individual actions and even lifestyle choices, although that broadens
26:46
them in ways, have no measurable effect on global climate change.
26:52
Our consequence—in terms of causal responsibility, almost inconsequential,
26:58
mere drops in the bucket, if not drops in the ocean for what’s going to happen.
27:03
The impacts of climate change are from aggregated actions of largely the release
27:09
of carbon dioxide of the burning of fossil fuels for energy that is produced
27:14
not only from my lifestyle choices but running of the global economy and
27:19
providing all the infrastructure and all the manufactured goods that I partake in,
27:25
so what you get vis-à-vis the notion of moral responsibility is a puzzle.
27:33
We are all each making the contributions through our lifestyle choices and
27:37
those of us in the developed first world with the privilege to exercise
27:42
a lot of power and act as consumers, consume a lot of energy, burn a lot
27:49
more carbon fuel and release a lot more.
27:53
Then plenty of other people.
27:54
They say something like in the U.S. there’s 7 or 8 times, the numbers
27:57
sort of shift, annual carbon emissions compared to people in Bangladesh or in
28:02
sub-Saharan Africa, or something like this, where the population is growing,
28:06
but it takes 7 or 8 of them to equal the carbon footprint of just one of us.
28:10
It looks like we would bear more responsibility with that kind of metric.
28:14
But still the actions of any one first-world person can’t prevent climate
28:20
change from what the outcome will be, what he future will bring vis-à-vis all
28:25
the accumulated CO2 in the atmosphere.
28:28
You have this sort of puzzle about it’s only the result of our actions
28:34
aggregated and how am I responsible, how is the responsibility for praise
28:40
or blame or what I think I should do if I want to be a responsible person,
28:44
how am I to be held accountable for the harmful effects of climate change.
28:50
Another problem—so that’s talking large about the causes being diffuse
28:55
across space and also across time because people have been burning
28:58
carbon since the middle of the 19th century, something like this, right?
29:03
Through the industrial revolution.
29:05
Most of the changes we’re seeing today are the result of carbon emissions emitted
29:09
well before our lifetime and there’s a lag in inertia in the carbon system.
29:16
We have diffusion of the causes over space and over time.
29:19
Most of them are dead, the people who caused extreme weather today.
29:25
It’s a huge conundrum for this notion of responsibility to praise or blame.
29:33
So that’s the agents’ bringing about the harm, you’ve got problems.
29:36
On the other end, those who suffer harms wrongly are largely in the people
29:42
who exist in the future, although some people of course insofar as we
29:49
either the probability or the extremity the strength of the extreme weather
29:54
events like hurricane Maria that hit Puerto Rico and the other ones
29:57
we saw in the Atlantic hurricane season this year, to anthropogenic
30:00
interference with the climate system.
30:03
That’s a nascent and evolving science that I do work in, largely its future
30:08
generations, persons as of yet unborn who will inherit a world that is the result
30:15
of the carbon emitting we’re doing today.
30:18
How do we characterize those harms?
30:22
There’s no identifiable individuals who suffer a harm.
30:26
There are no individuals whose rights are violated or whose pleasures or pains
30:30
are affected wrongly by my actions today.
30:33
So the string from my setting my thermometer or driving my car, 150
30:39
years out to individuals who we know will be migrants, refugees, climate
30:46
refugees suffering food shortages and harmed because of the actions we undertake
30:51
today is so tenuous and undiscoverable that the notion of holding us responsible
30:55
or blaming us for that becomes enormously difficult based on this received
31:00
conception of responsibility that we have.
31:04
That is the kind of problem arena in a way.
31:07
There’s ways to come at this through structures of law to
31:10
think about responsibility, there.
31:12
Litigation is largely the model that’s taken on in the law, but
31:16
there’s other models there, especially for corporate responsibility
31:19
and collective responsibility.
31:22
There’s questions about distributing the cost of the harms that we do in the
31:30
future back onto us because we get all the benefits of burning the fuels today.
31:35
We get all the benefits, but the harms are borne by people in the future.
31:39
Not us, but unique individuals.
31:41
There’s an asymmetry there.
31:43
How can we bear some of the cost for the harms that we’re causing and that’s
31:47
called the social cost of carbon.
31:49
They try to calculate that, figure out what that number is, and then build
31:53
that price into the cost of our burning carbon today as a kind of economic
31:59
strategy for shifting some of the cost of the harms that we’re doing back
32:02
onto those of us who are doing it.
32:04
Not very popular, but there’s a moral agreements there.
32:07
A lot of different ways to come at this.
32:11
Part of my work is to think of a moral responsibility not in terms
32:19
of backwards looking liability,
32:24
not as forward-looking, but not in terms of being accountable for certain states
32:30
of affairs that will be realized in the future, but to think of responsibility
32:36
as a character trait and as a virtue.
32:40
When we think about the roles different people have—this is the virtue ethics that
32:45
came to through my doctoral training in some ways—you know virtues are supposed
32:52
to be character dispositions to act and emotionally respond in situations
32:58
in an appropriate way, in an excellent way or in a way that reveals a proper
33:04
fitting or comprehension of how the good human being would act, doing
33:08
what the good human being would do.
33:09
Those character traits are the product of habituation and practice
33:13
and developments like a skill.
33:15
Through the course of our lives we can become more or less virtuous people or
33:19
develop the vices as a ballast in the ship of our lives to give it stability.
33:26
We develop these character traits.
33:28
The core idea here is that responsibility itself is a kind of character trait.
33:33
To illustrate this I often think about babysitters—having a young family
33:37
myself—it might be the case that two given babysitters, potential babysitters
33:45
both satisfy the duties of the role of babysitter in a checked-box fashion.
33:53
They put the food on the table.
33:54
They turn of the TV at the right time.
33:57
They make sure that the dressers don’t fall over on the kids.
34:01
They read the story to them.
34:03
They tuck them in, something like this.
34:05
Lock the door, wait for you while they chat with their boyfriend on
34:07
the phone or something like this.
34:10
But one of them could still be a better babysitter, a virtuous
34:15
babysitter, a responsible babysitter.
34:18
You think what is the character trait that makes—if someone’s sort of a more
34:22
responsible babysitter than the other, if I’ve granted that they both satisfied
34:26
the list of duties and in that way are equally morally up to the task, I think
34:31
the more responsible babysitter will have a kind of capacity to juggle the variety
34:39
of normative demands that are placed upon them in this role in a right way,
34:46
handle unexpected things with more grace, be on the lookout for things that the
34:52
other one might not have been, might be more caring, perhaps, in a certain kind
34:56
of way, another kind of virtue, right?
34:58
But you start thinking, it’s not duty-bound.
35:01
The excellence of sterile or doing well is not satisfied by doing the
35:05
duties or having certain outcomes—kids are safe when the parents come home.
35:09
It’s doing it in a certain kind of way with a capacity to juggle
35:13
the demands that are on you and satisfying that particular role.
35:17
They’re a responsible babysitter.
35:18
So, this is a characterization of responsibility as a character or virtue.
35:23
A lot of my work is to try to develop the idea of environmental
35:28
responsibility in that same way.
35:34
There’s other work in environmental virtues that try to think about
35:38
character traits that would make us a good environmentalist like which would
35:46
enable us in ways to be habitually disposed to have a lower carbon
35:53
footprint, a certain kind of—I draw a blank on the kind of word I want.
36:00
What’s the word when you use resources very efficiently?
36:03
It
36:08
may come to me in a moment.
36:09
You know, make due with what you have, be resourceful in a certain kind of way.
36:15
These are all character traits which make you a kind of good environmentalist
36:19
in the preservationist sense of having very low impact and needing
36:22
a certain model of an individual who has low impact for a certain kind
36:27
of outcome, lowering your impact.
36:30
But
36:32
we live in times now of changing ecologies as we move into the Anthropocene.
36:38
This is another area of my work in which it looks like the traditional goals of the
36:44
environmental movement in preservation in slowing the human encroachment into wild
36:53
and historic nature, pristine nature—here in North America we’ve got it in big parks
36:57
or protected landscapes, things like this.
36:59
It’s the natural world as much as we can as we have received it through
37:04
the Holocene the last 12,000 years preservation or conservation keep it
37:10
the way it was, keep the humans out, try to hold it in historic conditions,
37:16
in wild and historic compositions or if we’ve done damage restore it where
37:23
our goals for intentional intervention are to put it back the way we found it.
37:27
Something like this.
37:30
Those character traits of the kind of preservationist environmental mold do
37:34
that, minimize the impact on wild nature.
37:37
But if you know enough about the impacts, not only of climate change but a number of
37:44
very large anthropogenic drivers of environmental change: nitrogen deposition.
37:49
We install more nitrogen into soils, and then water ways and then oceans
37:54
than any other natural processes.
37:55
We move more earth by our Caterpillar tractors than any other natural
37:59
processes of earthquakes or landslides or anything like this.
38:02
We’re driving species extinct.
38:04
A lot of it’s connected to climate change, but not all of it: land use
38:07
and planning and all these things, even population pressures and agriculture.
38:15
There is pervasive and directional forces of anthropogenic, human-caused
38:22
environmental change such that it’s very plausible to think the ecological
38:28
future will not resemble the past, even if we get climate change under
38:32
control and hold it at say 2 degrees census as is nominally goal of the
38:42
UNFCCC international climate policy regime.
38:44
Even if we’re successful there, there’s going to be tons and tons of environmental
38:47
change, so what am I getting at?
38:50
The virtue traits that make you a good environmentalist as a preservationist will
38:55
be anachronistic and only befitting a time in the middle of the 20th century where it
39:01
still seemed intelligible to hold onto to nature writ large as we have received it.
39:07
The world will be new for our grandchildren like no other human
39:11
beings have seen, at least in the last 12,000 years when we came out of
39:15
the last ice age in the Pleistocene.
39:25
So, responsibility and climate change that’s the discourse here.
39:33
You might start thinking what is it to be a responsible environmentalist in
39:39
this moment of transition and change when we’re on the cusp of utterly
39:43
unprecedented environmental changes.
39:47
It does not look like we will prevent them.
39:49
Some we can slow, and I do think the preservation and restoration
39:53
in historic ecosystem goals definitely still have their place.
39:58
We should do more of that.
39:59
We should set aside more land for conservation.
40:00
We should reduce the rate at which we’re consuming natural resources.
40:05
None of that will hold the received natural world from the
40:08
Holocene for 200 years hence.
40:11
All of the ecosystems are moving towards the poles, species are migrating towards
40:17
the poles from the equator because of the heat and up mountains and there’s nothing
40:21
we can do about really any of that.
40:24
Novel ecosystems are emerging as a result of human interference of the
40:28
likes we’ve never seen before and no one knows what to do with it.
40:30
That’s a big part of my work, the ethics of novel ecosystems.
40:32
So you think what are the character traits of good—so, I think collectively
40:39
we are responsible for the changes going on in the planet and I’ll try
40:43
to bring this to a bit of a close.
40:45
If the aliens were to come down in a spaceship and say
40:48
what’s going on around here.
40:50
They take a look around and they say who’s in charge and
40:53
who’s responsible and it’s us.
40:54
It’s not the elephants or something.
40:56
They’ll say human beings, here are the closest smart things to us we
41:00
hold you responsible collectively.
41:03
Maybe we’re out of our own control.
41:04
Maybe it’s a fantasy that we can do anything about this but we
41:07
seem to be the responsible party.
41:08
We’re bringing this about.
41:10
So, we’re causally responsible collectively.
41:13
What is it then to be a good human being, an excellent human being
41:17
vis-à-vis the environment for each and every individual insofar as being
41:22
responsible collectively would be to have a kind of virtue of stewardship.
41:26
Since we are collectively responsible for the conditions under which all life on
41:30
the planet will foster or fail, if that it is what it is to be a human being today,
41:39
then I think that provides grounds for thinking what it is and since I am in the
41:44
instance of a human being irrevocably so and a member of that group in a way that
41:49
my identity is bound with it, what it is for me to be a good instance of a human
41:54
being, there will be a set of virtues that can’t be the preservationist virtues only.
42:00
It’s the development of new kind of virtues as being the responsible
42:04
parties for the biosphere.
42:08
You can I can’t causally do it with our light switches but as we are qua
42:12
a member of our species humanity, that is itself the kind of thing
42:17
is responsible for it, what it is to do that in an excellent fashion?
42:21
That’s an open question.
42:22
It’s not clear how to manifest that kind of virtue, to think about the
42:28
virtue of environmental responsibility as it bears upon us as individuals.
42:31
I do some work to try to trace that out with the hope of delivering to
42:40
develop that as a philosophy for my grandchildren to think about what it is
42:45
to be an environmentalist and to love nature when their concept of nature
42:50
can’t be untouched, pristine wilderness.
42:54
I grew up thinking the wild American west where the Indians happened to
42:58
be, was like you know the stuff, God’s country, untouched by humanity.
43:02
That’s the stuff and there’s humans and there’s that, save that, that’s
43:06
nature—that’s not going to be a possible idea of nature for them.
43:09
It will not be coherent.
43:11
But we want to think of there being environmentalism, a
43:13
concept of environmentalism as
43:16
a good and something valuable that today we can’t really form and I see
43:22
us as on the edge of the collapse of the industrial civilization as
43:27
it were, not in my lifetime, not in my grandchildren’s lifetime.
43:31
The culture of consumerism—we will either drive it way into the ground
43:34
but what’s going to happen on the other side of the environmental crisis.
43:37
How will they think of nature?
43:38
To think about what is it to be responsible environmentalists
43:42
in that world then and then trying to backtrack a little bit.
43:46
If we think we’re in a period
43:53
of transition, what are the virtues of transition?
43:54
What are the environmental virtues of this transition period?
43:58
I think it has a lot to do largely with political activism, because it’s only
44:02
through political collective action that we can effect a change in the
44:06
direction of the desires that we might have to reduce the kind of impacts.
44:11
We’re not going to avoid climate change.
44:12
It’s all about the downward curve.
44:14
We’re in climate change now, and so what can we do today.
44:18
We can politically organize.
44:20
We can fight in the face of what appeared to be hopeless battles,
44:25
give up hope of winning the war but develop a kind of courage to go
44:28
on anyway, a kind of radical hope.
44:31
I write about that and these are notions of responsibility and
44:35
virtues in the face of anthropogenic climate change now and in the future.
44:41
Can you talk more about novel ecosystems and I guess compare them to classical
44:47
ecological restoration or that idea?
44:49
Yeah.
44:55
As I alluded to,
44:59
early environmental philosophers—Holmes Rolston, James Callicott, and others—were
45:04
developing ideas that would look in the end to be useful to stem the
45:10
damage done by human impacts on the environment which they were becoming
45:13
aware of in the postwar period in the ‘50s and ‘60s, Rachel Carson’s Silent
45:17
Spring, and all that sort of stuff, think of a theory or value to help us
45:21
in some ways underpin legislation that we got with the Endangered Species Act.
45:24
So, they got these notions of intrinsic value of nature as valuable for its own
45:28
sake, independent of its usefulness to us.
45:32
Intrinsic value of nature is never mentioned in the Endangered Species Act
45:35
and anyway, but that was sort of the goal and what we start to see now is
45:40
preserve and conserve nature and the environmental philosophy is designed
45:43
to explain why that was valuable.
45:46
When we saw that there was impacts of human beings and we saw that instead of
45:50
just having negative impacts we could rebuild nature in some way—the bionic
45:57
man, better, faster, stronger—rebuild the damage that’s been done.
46:03
At first environmental philosophers were largely negative about that.
46:09
Robert Elliot, key among them, and Eric Katz, for different reasons.
46:13
The idea was oh this restoration thesis that we can impact and harm nature but
46:18
don’t worry we can put all the value back by rebuilding it to be just as good
46:22
as it was, would be used for nefarious purposes, would justify developing and
46:31
cutting up new areas of nature on the idea that whatever value is lost there we
46:36
can replace with our restoration here and we’ll have a one-to-one net zero loss.
46:40
When they argued against the value equivalence of restored landscapes
46:44
compared to pristine or historic landscapes, even if they’re
46:49
identical copies, one has a certain kind of history free of human
46:53
intervention and we value that.
46:55
Then we saw there’s more benevolent restorations as well.
46:58
Andrew Light brought out this idea.
47:00
It’s like, look, we know that could go on but those are the purposes it’s put to.
47:04
Also we will be much better if we do restoration here on these
47:08
mine-tailings or this wasted energy site or something like this.
47:12
We can make it better.
47:13
We can get it on its way to natural recovery by doing restoration.
47:18
We start to see we need that also.
47:20
Those goals, though, however, when restoration became available,
47:24
good project still took historic eco-systemic conditions as setting
47:34
the goals for the interventions.
47:36
Study reference, sites which means sites that are undisturbed and what we
47:42
think this site would have been prior to human degradation, measure—take
47:48
a metric of the species composition and the function of the structure of
47:52
that ecosystem and then rebuild that over here, the way it was undisturbed.
47:58
But it turns out that due to a human interference of some kind or another,
48:04
on site or off-site, some kind of human effect, with an e, many ecosystems
48:12
get knocked out of their basin of resilience, the form that they can
48:18
survive different kind of perturbations and re-bounce into a dynamic equilibrium
48:23
that holds an ecosystem together.
48:25
There’s a lot of ecosystem theory here that I don’t want to have to unpack.
48:29
We do damage to ecosystems in particular places and if it’s left alone long enough,
48:36
it starts to rebound but in ways into a new basin of resilience, into a new
48:44
functional ecosystem that itself has functional characteristic composition
48:50
and functional capacity for which there is no analog in the ecological record,
48:55
that we don’t have any analog for.
48:58
It’s not a type that we’ve seen.
49:01
This was first a challenge, when I came to this, for restoration ecologists.
49:05
Well, look at this functioning system here.
49:06
It’s doing things.
49:07
It’s providing not only ecosystem services for human beings, maybe
49:13
with cleaning the water or the air or something or recreationally, it’s
49:17
also providing services for maybe this endangered species in a new habitat.
49:21
Maybe there’s a non-native berry that’s come in, or a non-native animal
49:26
that has integrated itself into the food chain and now plays a role as a
49:31
necessary component for the ongoing existence of this other endangered
49:35
species that’s here in the system.
49:37
You start getting the goals of historic environmentalism pulled
49:40
apart there: get rid of the invasive.
49:43
Put the system back the way it was.
49:45
Take that compositional feature out, because it was not there historically.
49:47
Get rid of the invasive.
49:49
But you have to intervene to do that.
49:51
Then you’d be putting at threat the species you are
49:54
trying to actively conserve.
49:56
What’s going to have priority here?
49:57
That’s a new problem.
49:59
It used to just be set aside the traditional habitat that gives you
50:04
your wild historic ecosystem and what you can do to preserve the species
50:08
therein—they start coming apart.
50:11
Or if we’re going to restore it to what’s historic, you think really?
50:15
Should we wipe out this functioning, new, novel ecosystem here
50:23
that’s wild in its own way?
50:24
That’s nature rebounding?
50:25
For the sake of putting back what was here 100 years ago when we know that
50:32
the ecosystem here in situ that we found here 100, 200 years ago will not, because
50:38
of these background drivers, be able to stay here 200 years in the future?
50:43
That if we want to keep it here the way it is now it will require
50:47
ongoing and intensive human management making it like a little museum piece?
50:51
That’s not nature.
50:52
That’s not the wild nature we want to save.
50:55
There’s a cognitive dissonance.
50:57
Should we be doing this restoration at all?
51:00
What are we restoring when the past fails to give us viable goals for our land
51:06
management practices and our notions of wild nature and historic nature
51:11
come apart and you can’t have both in these principles of non-intervention.
51:17
So this is a big, big problem I think for environmentalism.
51:19
A geographer, Erle Ellis, with Michael Perring has estimated that on the
51:24
terrestrial non-frozen surface of the planet by some measure or another
51:30
about 38% of that is in some novel condition already.
51:33
Most of the ecosystems in Europe are long, deeply cultured ecosystems.
51:39
There’s remnants of historic ones around in the first world, Australia
51:43
and in the U.S., but they’re shrinking and they’re changing.
51:46
We think what do we do with these novel ecosystems?
51:49
How do we value them?
51:50
How do we start to,
51:55
how should we change our land management philosophies which have been conservation
52:00
and restoration of particular sites in the face of these emerging novel
52:05
ecosystems, and there’s a variety of ideas about how to do that, which require
52:10
flexibility, a certain adaptiveness, giving up on cherished old ideals, some
52:15
of which are romantic given the realities that we face, still very alluring.
52:20
I would like the old wild west to be—my fantasy vision of what that was
52:26
or something—to be real and all this, but it’s not, and it’s not going to
52:30
be in the future so we need new values for that, and that’s work that I do
52:36
on the ethics of novel ecosystems.
52:39
What kind of reception do you get from ecologists when you
52:41
talk with them about this?
52:42
That’s a great question, because it used to be when I would go speak at—I
52:47
was brought in on this under a wing of a number of sort of what I think of as
52:52
cutting-edge ecologists, paleo ecologists [a lot of them are], and restoration
52:58
ecologists, and when we would go to this Society for Ecological Restoration, big
53:02
international world meetings and I would talk and talk about some value issues at
53:05
play it’s like being booed off the stage.
53:09
Small venues and
53:13
just the vile from so many people whose career and professional identities
53:17
is preserve or restore the past.
53:20
Don’t give up.
53:21
That’s giving into... it’s a Trojan horse of some kind.
53:26
But over the course of 5 or 6 years you see an evolution of the acceptance of
53:32
the realities that this has to happen.
53:33
You get bigger and bigger audiences.
53:35
You get more people trying to incorporate the new ideas into the toolkit.
53:41
I’ll say we: the group of people working on these novel ecosystems
53:45
are not advocating a wholesale replacement of the tools of traditional
53:50
preservation and conservation.
53:51
There’s plenty of species invasions we want to spend money to push out, but
53:57
accepting some change in some modified ways gives you more flexibility in your
54:01
land management practice and reidentifying some of the goals and recognizing that
54:06
anthropocentrism might play a bigger role in there, even if you have the goals of
54:10
a traditional species conservationist.
54:13
It might require diverging from the history to think in kind of ways.
54:18
That’s becoming more recognized, I believe, so the reception
54:24
becomes more friendly and bigger audiences and when I talk with people
54:31
about it, you get more and more interest from students all the time who are
54:35
not brought up in the same kind of training that their teachers were when
54:39
this wasn’t on the radar, and it was traditionally backward-oriented looking
54:43
ecological preservation and conservation.
54:45
They say change follows the hearse sometimes and I just mean to
54:49
say there’s even more enthusiasm out of today’s graduate students
54:54
than the generation above them.
54:57
Given your collaborative work with people in a variety of disciplines, what has
55:03
your experience been like in communicating with scientists as a philosopher,
55:07
bringing your perspective to the table?
55:10
They very much like to hear it, I think.
55:14
By training and by professional practice, which becomes tied in with their
55:19
sources of funding, scientists who work on government grants for this reason
55:27
represent the public and our model here is that they’re just doing purely descriptive
55:32
science and all the values and moral judgments will be made by the policy
55:38
makers who are elected representatives, most of whom don’t understand the science.
55:42
But doing the science they methodically work to avoid mentioning
55:49
in any case norms or values.
55:52
They try their best to strip it.
55:54
The whole thing is designed to strip values because it just looks like biases
55:57
and it threatens their funding and their legitimacy to objective truth and all this
56:01
sort of stuff, which I really understand.
56:05
But they’re hungry to know how the work they’re doing, I mean as
56:08
citizens and as people largely they are environmentally sympathetic, the
56:12
natural environment ones and even the atmospheric ones, and they’re hungry
56:16
to know how the work they do applies in policy or has value implications.
56:23
A lot of my work is the bridge building in that kind of way.
56:28
I am bright enough to become scientifically literate in the
56:32
particulars of the fields that I stick my nose into and I bring all of this
56:38
language of ethical thinking, normative thinking, policy thinking, value
56:44
thinking to look for the strands and draw out the normative language there.
56:52
I then take on that and I can write articles where I make normative claims
56:57
because that’s what I’m trained to do, whereas they can’t really do that or are
57:02
under pressures not to be doing that.
57:04
The collective work, I haven’t thought of—you know they have to
57:07
say things like when we write things together and there’s normative claims.
57:11
There’s always the disclaimers in the front by the scientists who say
57:14
I write this as Joe Citizen not under the guise of my position as Federally
57:22
Funded Scientist, these sorts of things.
57:25
They like doing it, but there’s a caution there.
57:28
Extremely intelligent people teach me lots of things all the time.
57:37
There’s some limitations to doing the work.
57:41
Sometimes I get a little tired, I’ll say.
57:45
You know, you have a little pet ethical theory.
57:48
Over here with the philosophers I’ve developed my little ethical
57:51
approach to it with a common toolbox but my own special view there.
57:54
I’m not playing in the sandbox of ethical theory all the time what
57:57
those guys, I just have my little tool bag and I come walking over.
58:00
I’m like oh let’s see your problem.
58:02
Ecological restoration?
58:03
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom—I start unpacking my taxonomy about virtue
58:07
and responsibility and I make it fit that and I can say things that are of
58:11
interest to people and they’ll eat it up.
58:14
What the other scientists can’t do largely is say what about the
58:18
deontological approach to this?
58:20
The rights based approach?
58:22
What about the utilitarian maximizing notions of rationality or utilitarianism,
58:30
a naïve consequentialism... they don’t push back on me on that stuff right there
58:35
and usually I’m the token philosopher in a group of a variety of scientists.
58:43
It has its limitations and of course I cannot answer the subtle questions
58:47
that we get involved in conceptually.
58:49
I mean the middle playground is really about the nature of the concepts that are
58:53
emerging, that they’re struggling with.
58:55
They know the angles where I come at the end of my rope in my
59:00
scientific training and they have to go off and talk by themselves.
59:03
Similarly as I explained, they’re coming to the end of their rope when there’s
59:08
certain ethical stuff that it’s the end of the line for that discussion with them.
59:12
But in the middle I think there’s a lot of productivity because you get
59:18
imaginative people who are not then constrained by the dogma of those trained
59:24
in the same way just by the same field.
59:26
So you get the conditions for
59:30
sort of fertile work.
59:35
What has your experience been as a Carson Fellow?
59:39
Oh, at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and
59:43
Society in Munich, Germany.
59:45
That was awesome.
59:47
That is largely that’s sort of an environmental humanities center
59:51
funded by the German government, run under at the present time under
59:58
the Ludwig Maximillian Universität, LMU, or the University of Munich.
1:00:04
It’s in Munich, Germany.
1:00:06
They do environmental humanities, largely it’s environmental history,
1:00:11
and so to have a philosopher there was sort of irregular, but the resources
1:00:15
and the support are just fantastic.
1:00:18
Again, there’s interdisciplinary opportunities there.
1:00:21
There’s a weekly colloquia and engagement and presentations that we do.
1:00:26
I got an office and a lot of time away from teaching and away from
1:00:31
the U.S. and other normal things to focus on the novel ecosystem work.
1:00:36
You get the kind of fertile grounds for that imaginative work that everyone
1:00:42
can get from doing interdisciplinary work—not with other scientists,
1:00:45
as I just finished describing, but across disciplinary perspectives on
1:00:49
environmental issues in the humanities.
1:00:55
What did you think of living in Germany?
1:00:57
That was fantastic.
1:00:58
That was southern Germany, in Munich, Bavaria.
1:01:01
I took my family: my wife and my kids, which I will say was a fantastic
1:01:06
experience for all of us as a family and having young kids there old enough
1:01:10
at the time to remember it and engage.
1:01:13
They went for a while to German-speaking public schools, each to different ones.
1:01:18
Those are going to be very memorable impressions upon them, but not too old
1:01:23
so that they would rather me and my wife go and they might stay at home
1:01:27
and throw some parties or something.
1:01:28
You know, they’re going to be disengaged and more connected with
1:01:30
their peers the older they get.
1:01:31
It was perfect timing for that.
1:01:34
We traveled all over.
1:01:36
I gave many, many different talks.
1:01:37
I would find universities to talk at.
1:01:41
I got some funding or it’d be cheap for them because you don’t
1:01:44
have to do the overseas one.
1:01:45
They would just put me on a train and I would use that as an
1:01:48
excuse, they’d pay for a night or two of a hotel in someplace.
1:01:51
I would bring my family and get another hotel room and then we’d
1:01:54
stay for another day or two and explore Prague or Vienna or Kiel up
1:02:00
in Germany and Homberg along the way.
1:02:05
We went down also to Venice and to Florence, Italy and things like this.
1:02:12
Just fantastic times.
1:02:14
It takes away a little bit from the progress I might have aspired
1:02:17
to when I pitched my program to the Rachel Carson Center, but they
1:02:21
know about those sort of things.
1:02:23
It all goes towards the work at the end.
1:02:27
Now I’ll move on to some broader questions about climate change.
1:02:31
Okay, yeah.
1:02:32
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how
1:02:35
have they shifted over time?
1:02:40
Early ones were involved in, of course especially here in the Americas, in
1:02:48
North America, against the kind of sociopolitical backdrop we have of there
1:02:53
being a class of deniers, or climate change deniers, which is not really
1:02:58
characteristic of any other developed
1:03:02
country in the world, or I should just say in the world, developed
1:03:05
or undeveloped economically.
1:03:08
It was the kind of discourse propped up by ideas about that fair
1:03:14
journalism presents both sides of the story as if they were equally true.
1:03:18
So, you give as much legitimacy to climate deniers who are funded by various kinds
1:03:26
of oil industries or other things like this and think tanks and not having
1:03:32
peer-reviewed science equal weight in the news presentation so you get a public that
1:03:36
says what about these skeptical questions?
1:03:39
What about sunspots?
1:03:40
What about solar fires?
1:03:42
Something like this.
1:03:44
Early on the epistemological and philosophy of science issues to
1:03:49
say what counts as good evidence?
1:03:52
Where should we place our trust?
1:03:53
Unpacking some of that
1:03:58
story of the pressures of journalists to provide it as though it’s a live issue.
1:04:03
It’s not like we say oh slavery pro and con, you know?
1:04:06
There’s a decided issue.
1:04:08
At one time there might have been a moral dispute, but that time is over
1:04:12
and it’s also true with I think a lot of questions about sexual orientation used
1:04:18
to be in the applied ethics books among the sort of drug use, that’s changing.
1:04:24
Homosexuality, affirmative action,
1:04:29
I don’t know what else do you have?
1:04:30
Abortion, euthanasia, these sort of applied ethical questions.
1:04:34
Like I said, slavery’s not on there.
1:04:36
And really the sexual orientation drops off.
1:04:40
A lot of the recreational drug use starts to drop off
1:04:42
because the issues get settled.
1:04:46
Similarly with climate change, people in the know as it were.
1:04:50
Early on it was a lot of that kind of epistemological
1:04:53
philosophy of science stuff.
1:04:55
It changed over the years because, again, with the changing of the guard
1:04:58
you get children who were raised
1:05:02
knowing and accepting more about that and seeing the recalcitrance of the
1:05:06
establishment in propagating a certain denialism and can follow the money on
1:05:11
that and know these sort of stories.
1:05:13
Naomi Klein and others who do this kind of work—analogies with tobacco
1:05:20
and disinformation campaigns, where the funding comes from, from
1:05:23
the idea that it’s not harmful.
1:05:24
All of that has strong parallels in the climate change.
1:05:29
Then what starts to happen people accept that climate change is caused and then
1:05:35
you think well what’s the response?
1:05:38
Lighten your carbon footprint.
1:05:40
Story’s first about what can I do to be a good individual
1:05:44
environmental citizen, how can I?
1:05:46
You get the early Al Gore stuff, The Inconvenient Truth movie.
1:05:50
At the end he’s got these bullet points scrolling: make sure your
1:05:53
tires are inflated properly, make sure your lightbulbs are
1:05:56
CFLs or whatever the, you know.
1:05:59
You think God dammit!
1:06:01
That’s not going to do anything.
1:06:03
But that’s the mode of like—there’s a defense to doing that and it’s a virtue.
1:06:11
Those are virtues.
1:06:12
Do your part.
1:06:14
But consequentially it’s not that important.
1:06:16
Maybe you’ll influence others around you.
1:06:18
That’s the first sort of response.
1:06:20
Okay I accept it.
1:06:21
Tell me how morally I should behave.
1:06:23
I see.
1:06:24
There’s pretty much one lesson: it’s bad
1:06:28
because it’s harmful either to only human beings or to species and other animals
1:06:33
and other ecosystems, whether you’re anthropocentric or not, will be harmful
1:06:36
in the future, we’re responsible, I should act differently, so what should I do?
1:06:41
The technocrats will give me the list, reduce my carbon footprint.
1:06:44
It seems like a pretty simple moral lesson.
1:06:47
It doesn’t seem like a lot of philosophical puzzlement in that.
1:06:52
I think also then a lot of people start straying away from it.
1:06:56
I taught some climate ethics classes where there were 15 people at
1:06:59
first and it went down to 3 people
1:07:02
because I believe, and I may be—that there’s a period of transition where
1:07:09
I project onto students the kind of idea that I already know this is bad.
1:07:15
What, he’s going to tell me it’s wrong?
1:07:17
I know it’s wrong.
1:07:18
I know some of my lifestyles are wrong.
1:07:20
I’m guilty enough.
1:07:22
I don’t want to go to class where we read about the details of why
1:07:26
fingers are rightly wagged at me for buying a new iPhone every
1:07:31
year and a half or whatever it is.
1:07:33
I know I should eat less meat.
1:07:34
They typically won’t say that.
1:07:35
I know I should drive more.
1:07:38
There’s a kind of defensiveness.
1:07:39
It’s going to be guilt-ridden.
1:07:40
They think that’s all that might be.
1:07:44
I think there’s a transition in one way to try to bring this around from
1:07:48
environmental ethics, which in some ways is the development of traditional ethical
1:07:53
theories, the expansion of traditional human ethical theories onto topics about
1:08:00
the environment as an extension, as the project to bring in more things like this.
1:08:04
There was some development of new ways of thinking about intrinsic
1:08:07
value and non-anthropocentric.
1:08:09
Climate change was brought in.
1:08:11
I think now I have an interest in talking more about environmental
1:08:14
philosophy, sort of broadening it.
1:08:17
There are questions about the sciences.
1:08:21
There’s questions about politics and social justice, environmental
1:08:25
justice and human justice, which isn’t just be nice to animals and reduce
1:08:30
pressures on ecosystems sort of stuff.
1:08:34
Future generations we don’t have a good grasp on thinking morally about
1:08:38
our obligations to future generations.
1:08:39
There’s underdevelopment there in theory.
1:08:43
Who am I?
1:08:44
What’s my role here as we move into the Anthropocene?
1:08:47
What is it to be a human?
1:08:49
These are questions of metaphysics.
1:08:51
Who am I as a member of a society that does this?
1:08:55
Or if we fail our first order of ethical obligations to future generations
1:09:00
by not doing what we’re supposed to be doing today, which we seem
1:09:05
to be failing, what should we do?
1:09:08
Morally what should we do?
1:09:09
That’s a puzzling question.
1:09:11
There’s philosophical content there to unpack that is not what is your principle,
1:09:16
tell me what I should be doing given that the things we do collectively
1:09:19
cause damage to the environment.
1:09:22
Of course all the politics, the dynamics, the diplomacy is also of
1:09:26
great interest to political theory and law about climate change and other
1:09:30
impacts of the unfolding Anthropocene.
1:09:34
It’s environmental philosophy for the Anthropocene that’s new.
1:09:38
Those are new ways.
1:09:39
I’m trying to have classes like that.
1:09:41
It’s not just environmental ethics, it’s not just climate ethics as a specialized
1:09:46
version of that but environmental philosophy for the Anthropocene thinking.
1:09:53
You touched on this already, but I was wondering if you could speak
1:09:56
about the community of climate change researchers here at OSU and maybe
1:09:59
how the institution facilitates that.
1:10:04
I always forget the little, this is probably the part you should edit out.
1:10:08
I forget the acronyms of the sub-institutions of my colleagues there.
1:10:12
There’s the CCR, Climate Change Research Institute, that’s a state-mandated
1:10:22
group of climate scientists that have a job for the state of Oregon.
1:10:26
There is here a Pacific Northwest Climate Science Center that is under the USGS,
1:10:33
U.S. Geological Society which is a department of the interior, I believe.
1:10:37
There are seven federal climate science centers.
1:10:43
They have a mission and outreach.
1:10:45
It’s moving now from here.
1:10:48
It was up at the University of Washington.
1:10:50
It’s moved down here for a while and now they rebid and it goes back
1:10:54
up to the University of Washington and their governmental-university
1:10:59
partnerships to do things.
1:11:01
There are climate modelers and atmospheric scientists here who are
1:11:04
doing straightforward research on paleo
1:11:09
atmospheric conditions, paleo oceanography and how the climate was then to try to
1:11:14
figure out climate sensitivity, what a doubling of the CO2 atmospheric equivalent
1:11:21
would be in terms of temperature gradient.
1:11:24
We need a kind of metrics so we can measure and have estimates.
1:11:27
There’s great climate science going on here.
1:11:30
There are a variety of people doing different kinds of political
1:11:33
stuff over in political science.
1:11:34
There are people doing law and there’s people doing communication who is
1:11:40
heavily involved with communication dynamics of something like international
1:11:44
climate negotiations, my colleague Greg Walker does work like that.
1:11:49
The philosopher’s always kind of the fly on the wall in a way.
1:11:54
I will mention all that climate change stuff is largely cast as global
1:11:58
level atmospheric things in terms of atmospheric science, but the impacts
1:12:03
happen in local places, so you get extreme weather stuff and you get
1:12:09
changes to the ecologies because of that.
1:12:11
People who do fish and wildlife and forest ecology and bird migration
1:12:17
and conservation there, it’s the number one thing they think about:
1:12:21
what are the fundamental basic conditions because of climate change?
1:12:23
How are they changing behaviors and all this sort of stuff.
1:12:25
A lot of that goes on over there.
1:12:27
I talk with them about novel ecosystems and restoration and that sort of thing.
1:12:31
I talk with the climate people largely about something I haven’t
1:12:36
mentioned here, really the other major branch of my research, is
1:12:41
this ability that we have now have greater confidence in picking out
1:12:45
the human signal against the noise
1:12:50
of extreme weather events, heat waves and droughts largely, but also hurricanes.
1:12:55
We’re
1:12:59
getting better and better at that through a complicated scientific emerging area of
1:13:04
atmospheric science and to try to figure out how that connects to the policy stuff
1:13:09
going on under the UNFCCC or those comp meetings, the conference of the parties,
1:13:13
of the United Nations Framework on Climate
1:13:18
Change Convention.
1:13:20
It
1:13:22
is fantastic.
1:13:24
I drift a little trying to be exhaustive of all the different
1:13:29
people working on climate change here at OSU and how I engage with them.
1:13:32
I bounce around.
1:13:33
I get to meet a lot of different people you know and they don’t hear a lot about
1:13:37
philosophy and everyone is philosophical in their way, wonders about these things.
1:13:43
It’s a great privilege I think to have the training I have which enables me not
1:13:47
just to talk to other philosophers who know all about philosophical lingo and the
1:13:52
kind of insights philosophers generate, which are appealing and fun in their way,
1:13:57
I mean to belittle it, or enlightening, enriching of our human perspective.
1:14:03
Those guys know all that stuff, all those philosophers.
1:14:05
When I can go over and talk to scientists and show that I’m not just gazing
1:14:10
at my own navel or something, right?
1:14:12
People have ideas about philosophers that they’re full of shit.
1:14:14
They either have a lot of respect for them or they think
1:14:16
it’s just a bunch of baloney.
1:14:19
As soon as they see that I can listen to their science and ask good questions,
1:14:23
they say well what do you have to say?
1:14:24
And I sit there like wow, this is great.
1:14:26
I’m not used to hearing that.
1:14:29
It’s enriching in both directions.
1:14:32
Do you foresee being affected by diminishing funding for climate change
1:14:35
research under the Trump Administration?
1:14:37
I don’t because we in the humanities are largely hard money.
1:14:43
Hard money is state, all my money comes, and we don’t get very
1:14:47
much money, I am paid to teach.
1:14:50
I do research to keep my job and to get promoted.
1:14:52
But I’m paid to teach.
1:14:53
I have a heavier teaching load than my friends in any of the
1:14:56
sciences, my colleagues there.
1:14:59
They have soft money.
1:15:00
They have to make a living applying for grants and being successful
1:15:04
year in and year out in one form or another, which brings in a
1:15:08
lot of money but not permanently for them, reduces their teaching.
1:15:12
They have research that adds to the body of scientific knowledge.
1:15:16
You say what do I anticipate the changes in the current U.S. administration
1:15:21
there affecting my ability to carry on in the climate research that I do, and
1:15:26
fundamentally I say no because all I need is a laptop and a library card.
1:15:30
This
1:15:34
is getting a little boarder, but what kind of policy changes would
1:15:38
you like to see happen within the U.S. with respect to climate change?
1:15:45
I guess it depends on the level.
1:15:48
U.S. policy I would like to see us come in as a good world citizen, as
1:15:54
a nation-state, and rejoin the Paris Accord, or the Paris Agreement—sometimes
1:15:59
called the Paris Accord, which I think that we are the only nation
1:16:03
now that is no longer party to.
1:16:05
I think Sudan and other countries that have low moral standing in the
1:16:11
world community are on board with it and the U.S. is squandering an
1:16:15
opportunity for world leadership that it has long held and is good
1:16:20
for us in the world that it looks to.
1:16:24
China will overtake us in this and many things into the 21st
1:16:27
century, that’s due to mishandling by the president administration.
1:16:33
There’s a whole politics there I guess I won’t go into.
1:16:37
I’d like to see that change.
1:16:38
We’re just foregoing all sorts of wonderful things that we could be
1:16:42
doing in making the world move forward completely backwards to have the
1:16:49
language of climate change stripped from all these federal agencies.
1:16:52
You’ve seen in the paper perhaps recently it’s sort of
1:16:57
really been almost exhaustive, the language of climate change is
1:17:00
being pulled out of everywhere.
1:17:01
I think the head of the EPA, these are not policy changes, but
1:17:05
people in the administrative roles all sorts of professional class,
1:17:11
the bureaucracy of the government in the EPA and other places in
1:17:15
the state department are leaving.
1:17:17
We’re weakening our abilities even once the current administration is
1:17:20
replaced whenever that is, we’ll have a weakened infrastructure to
1:17:23
be able to handle these things.
1:17:24
The head of the EPA of course is just an industry insider
1:17:27
for the oil and gas companies.
1:17:29
All that’s a tremendous disaster.
1:17:33
They’ve just put a new road for the first time into the wilderness up in
1:17:36
ANWR, the Arctic National Refuge with no purpose whatsoever other than as a
1:17:41
precursor to start drilling for oil up there as the arctic continues to melt.
1:17:48
Besides all that sort of background stuff in the fantasy world I would
1:17:52
like to see a price put on carbon.
1:17:56
Whether you call it a carbon tax
1:18:02
or cap in trade, these really are different ways of doing the same thing.
1:18:06
It’s putting a price on carbon.
1:18:08
Carbon tax can do a better job
1:18:15
controlling in certain ways human behavior, but the cap in trade
1:18:21
takes care of market mechanisms.
1:18:23
Any of that exercise to put cap on carbon is absolutely essential and I would
1:18:27
like to see something like that happen.
1:18:30
What about changes to public education that you think maybe could
1:18:34
help Americans better understand climate change or potentially
1:18:37
change their behavior around it?
1:18:39
I don’t know about education.
1:18:44
The easy answer is always improve education, make the elementary school
1:18:50
teachers who have to sell baked goods to buy pencils and stuff for class
1:19:00
for a long time and worse funding under the current administration, you
1:19:05
can’t put it on their backs to do this.
1:19:10
I don’t have—I’ve had a lot to say, I suppose, during this interview but I don’t
1:19:14
think I have much to say on that front.
1:19:17
My last question I typically ask if you’re hopeful about the future of the
1:19:21
planet in the context of climate change, but you’ve written about radical hope.
1:19:24
Right, thank you.
1:19:24
I’m curious if you’ve always felt hopeful?
1:19:29
Maybe you could talk further about radical hope.
1:19:31
Yeah.
1:19:32
To personalize it a little, I guess, or to talk about the motivation as
1:19:37
the question is in some ways directed, it’s not any kind of hope that sort
1:19:41
of some catastrophe will be averted.
1:19:44
There’s certain parallels between the threat of catastrophic, anthropogenic
1:19:50
global climate change and the existential threat through the Cold
1:19:55
War period that I only saw the very tail end of about nuclear annihilation.
1:20:01
The ‘50s and the ‘60s drop and cover under your, you know, and
1:20:04
we would hold certain drills.
1:20:07
They were called earthquake drills or something when I was a kid in elementary
1:20:10
school but we went into these corridors like where the wheelchair ramp went
1:20:15
up which were clearly I think the most bomb-proof area of the whole building.
1:20:20
I think they’re faux nuclear disaster drills: stay away from the
1:20:23
windows and all this kind of stuff.
1:20:26
I mean to draw that parallel, there are a number of them to put on the table,
1:20:30
because there’s a certain kind of say well, look that’s an identifiable event,
1:20:35
thermonuclear war, that’s going to happen or not that we’re on the brink
1:20:39
of or not with your doomsday clock and so far it hasn’t happened but there’s
1:20:44
an identifiable thing to avoid that’s clear, you know, it’s either on, or
1:20:48
it isn’t and everyone struggles and the hope is to avoid that with all
1:20:52
of its environmental destruction.
1:20:53
The existential threat that is to human civilization as we know.
1:20:57
Suppose climate change, arguably, is that kind of existential threat
1:21:00
to human civilization as we know it, but there’s not going to be, there’s
1:21:04
not anything to hold off like that.
1:21:05
It unfolds slowly and continuously so it’s all about just slowly amp-ing
1:21:10
that stuff down, which will happen sooner or later just be attrition.
1:21:15
Could be more or less catastrophic, more or less harm can be done.
1:21:20
There’s not any event to hope that we avoid.
1:21:22
A lot of times people are like can we prevent climate change or not?
1:21:24
You think that’s a bad way to conceptualize it to begin with.
1:21:30
We’re in it.
1:21:31
It’s going to happen.
1:21:32
Don’t hope for that.
1:21:33
You can hope for outcomes that are more progressive if that’s your direction,
1:21:38
better outcome for the sake of the environment or for future generations, for
1:21:43
your own children, for the sake of other biodiversity or whatever it is you want,
1:21:47
minimizing the harms that are forthcoming,
1:21:52
and because we have our nose regularly, you know my Facebook stream, as you can
1:21:58
imagine, is a curated collection of stuff that the algorithm sees I’m interested
1:22:04
in and my people post, and it’s all bleak all the time, pretty much so.
1:22:11
That is harrowing to face every day in its own way.
1:22:17
The novel ecosystem stuff or the ideas of radical hope are to hold on
1:22:22
and say how can we in spite of all this can we make a positive spin?
1:22:28
Here you don’t want the positive spin to be out of,
1:22:34
what do I want, a naïve, romanticism, I guess I’ve set this up enough,
1:22:38
of avoiding big, big problems.
1:22:42
You’re not going to save nature, as you think nature is, the way we’ve
1:22:47
received it in the last 10,000 years.
1:22:49
You better start rethinking what it is you want out of the environment to
1:22:54
save because it’s not going to be that.
1:22:58
Accepting some of those realities but finding a way in which the
1:23:01
wild is emergent all the time in these novel ecosystems.
1:23:06
Some people try to do this.
1:23:07
There’s this book out recently called
1:23:13
Why the Biodiversity Crisis is Not As Bad As You Think, or The Inevitable Rebounding
1:23:18
of Nature, or something like that and it’s hopeful in ways that are way out of
1:23:22
my league because it’s an accomplished ecologist who fundamentally says in the
1:23:28
long run biodiversity will come back.
1:23:32
There’s an asteroid wipes out most of the life on the planet but it all comes
1:23:37
back in millions and millions of years.
1:23:39
Don’t worry humans.
1:23:40
You think I guess so but what about the next 10,000 years in
1:23:46
which humanity might be around.
1:23:51
That doesn’t provide the support for that sort of thing.
1:23:54
I think that is a misdirection to look for hope.
1:23:58
We have to deal with what is forthcoming.
1:24:02
I’m not sure how still do address my children’s concerns about the
1:24:08
environment or as they become educated through the system thinking about real
1:24:15
diminishment of the natural world as we know it and received it that they
1:24:18
will experience more so than I have.
1:24:19
I don’t really know how to broach that with them and not crush.
1:24:26
That’s the puzzle.
1:24:27
I try to do work in which we think about how hope is possible.
1:24:32
Like you said, the radical hope, that’s a complicated notion.
1:24:35
I guess I mentioned it a little bit about it’s really a form of
1:24:37
courage, the good will return in a way that we cannot understand today.
1:24:44
I have confidence that the phoenix will arise.
1:24:47
What can I do to help get between now and then?
1:24:52
How can I help the transition and what might we imagine people will
1:24:56
be armed with to think about, to be good environmentalists and to
1:24:59
love nature as that makes any sense to me conceptually, how will they?
1:25:04
It’s thinking into the future.
1:25:06
That’s sort of hopeful work.
1:25:08
Otherwise, you’re just walking around like they say, I forget who
1:25:12
said it, and people said if you do conservation biology today it’s largely
1:25:21
the taking attendance at a funeral or something like that.
1:25:24
It’s cataloguing death row.
1:25:27
They go out there and they measure and how soon will this be gone?
1:25:30
How quickly is this declining?
1:25:32
That’s the job.
1:25:33
You think, that’s not philosophy, Jesus Christ that is
1:25:38
conditions for hopelessness.
1:25:48
Humanity
1:25:57
is remarkable, is resilient, we don’t know what we’re capable of both good and bad.
1:26:03
It’s a mystery to us.
1:26:04
As history unfolds we see what we do, somehow accidentally, altogether and
1:26:10
some of the things are very admirable.
1:26:12
I think we could be proud from a universal perspective that the hairless
1:26:17
apes that are can organize and respect moral human equality and things like
1:26:22
this, even if we don’t realize it.
1:26:23
That is coming out of the swamp, or whatever, we can stand up and
1:26:29
be beings who understand that kind of stuff and do some of it.
1:26:33
Still, we are horrible to each other.
1:26:35
I guess what I want to say is you never know what we’ll do coming through this.
1:26:40
Maybe the greatest—they talk about the greatest generation getting through World
1:26:43
War II, all the sacrifice of depression and fighting fascism and everything,
1:26:49
maybe you get the greenest generation now.
1:26:51
It looks like we’re going to be the scourge of the future.
1:26:53
They’ll look back and say why did you continue to buy iPods all the time?
1:26:59
But maybe we’ll get it together.
1:27:01
Things might change, and it can happen very quickly.
1:27:04
There’s that.
1:27:05
I’m hopeful for that.
1:27:07
Then you also think about
1:27:10
the people who wake up every day not knowing where their meals are coming from
1:27:15
or who will see their families executed by the other ethnic group that comes
1:27:19
through with machetes or people who lived in Nazi Germany during World War II, you
1:27:25
know are persecuted by acts of genocide and things like that and you think
1:27:30
my life is much, much better than that.
1:27:32
Me, personally, and even all the story about ecological degradation
1:27:38
it’s not a horror like that which is constrained in a way.
1:27:43
As this guy Rob [Nixon] , he’s at Princeton now,
1:27:49
Rob talks about a slow violence.
1:27:51
You get this idea it’s harder to perceive the violence we’re doing to each other
1:27:57
and the natural world because of the nature of the speed at which it unfolds.
1:28:02
It’s not like bombs fall and that sort of stuff.
1:28:07
I’m some ways now from your question about the hope.
1:28:09
I’ve tried to talk about humanity as being a hopeful kind of creature,
1:28:15
and we can sustain the hope.
1:28:17
It’d be different if we were under conditions of yeah well what
1:28:23
time did the bombs fall today?
1:28:24
Where’s the meal coming from?
1:28:26
Many of us a little more secure than that and I think could exercise the
1:28:30
power that we have to gear the ship of humanity in a way that’s not as
1:28:34
utterly disgraceful as it might go.
1:28:39
That’s my hope.
1:28:42
Well, we’ve reached the conclusion of the interview.
1:28:44
Thank you for participating.
1:28:45
I appreciate it.
1:28:45
Okay, thank you.
