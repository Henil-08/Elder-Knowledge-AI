00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández and I am the curator of the Oregon
00:07
Multicultural Archives at Oregon State University and this is an oral history
00:12
interview as part of the IRCO Asian Family Center Oral History Project.
00:17
Today’s date is July 31st, 2015 and we are in Portland, Oregon.
00:22
So we’ll go ahead and begin.
00:23
If you could please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:27
My name is Linda Nguyen.
00:29
That’s L-I-N-D-A, last name is N-G-U-Y-E-N.
00:34
And what is your birthdate and your birthplace?
00:38
October 13, 1966.
00:40
I was born in Vietnam.
00:43
And with, with, with.
00:45
Excuse me, with which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
00:50
I’m Vietnamese.
00:52
And when and where were your parents born?
00:54
In Vietnam.
00:57
And so is that where you grew up for most of your childhood, in Vietnam?
01:00
Yes.
01:02
Can you describe a little bit about your childhood and what your parents did?
01:06
I came here very young.
01:07
I came here when I was only 8 years old.
01:09
So my memories is very little of Vietnam.
01:14
I haven’t been back to Vietnam before, but this is pretty much, I was, you know
01:21
I raised as Vietnamese, but my culture really, I’m between country, you know.
01:29
So your tradition is Vietnamese, but you are Americanized, you know; so, but
01:35
people ask me “what am I?” I, I say, I’m Vietnamese, but if I go somewhere
01:41
different country and they ask me who am I? I say I am United States, I’m American.
01:46
So I guess you can say that I am from two countries, you know.
01:55
I don’t have very much memory of Vietnam, so.
01:59
I came here too young, but I do remember when I left the country, but not childhood
02:06
very much; very, very, very little, yeah.
02:12
And what did your parents do in, in Vietnam?
02:15
My mother is a, she, she sell gold and I guess she, she sell gold and
02:23
she have side job like a little wagon to sell Vietnamese food.
02:28
She’s my mom, that’s what she do, but my father is; he’s, I just know that he’s
02:35
a very powerful man in our country so that’s why, they said that that’s why
02:43
they said we had to flee the country when we left, when the South got invaded.
02:50
So we had to leave.
02:51
So here I am because if we stay when all of us going to; I guess they had to.
03:01
He said we were all going to be executed if we left, if we stay I mean.
03:07
And you had siblings?
03:09
Oh yes, there’s, there’s ten of us.
03:13
There’s seven girls and three boys, yeah.
03:18
And at the time that you and your family left Vietnam, all of your
03:23
siblings were able to leave with you?
03:24
Yes, everyone, everyone had to leave.
03:29
The United States government made sure that we leave, so yeah.
03:34
And this was in the late 1960’s?
03:36
No, 19 where are we?
03:38
1975.
03:39
Oh, ‘75?
03:44
When they took over, the minute they took over Vietnam, yeah.
03:48
And I guess in ‘75 I remember when we left, that when we left that when
03:56
we left I guess the communist was trying to bomb our boat, and yeah,
04:05
that’s I remember very well, yeah.
04:08
So you remember the actual experience of traveling from
04:11
Vietnam to the United States?
04:11
Yeah.
04:13
Oh yeah, I remember all that, every second of it.
04:19
I think that’s, that memory will never leave you.
04:22
It doesn’t matter how old you are.
04:25
You remember that all you can do is, your entire family just frightened
04:31
and scared - and you know because when we left, I guess when the Commies
04:39
come in whoever it is trying to leave any, they invade the ocean, you know.
04:46
They go there first I guess, I don’t know how it work, but all I know is
04:50
that bombs were blown right next to your boat, forward, sideward, all over.
04:56
You know, you don’t know if you’re going to, that bomb is going to hit you or not.
05:03
But you know, and we just had to make it to an American ship, we had to make
05:09
it there and we did and then when we got there we got into Guam and that’s
05:17
where I lived for a while, yeah.
05:20
How long did you and your family live there?
05:23
My parents said we lived there for like two or three years, in Guam.
05:29
I, you know you’re eight years old, you, you just don’t
05:34
remember much of what they say.
05:37
You just remember the bad things.
05:40
So a lot of things here, I learned a lot since I come here to this agency.
05:49
They give me a lot, they give me memories, you know.
05:54
And a lot of culture stuff even though my family are very tradition,
05:59
we are very old fashioned, but its, it’s really nice to see you learn
06:05
more things that’s so different; the culture changed so much, you know.
06:12
And the way your country change.
06:16
So if, I don’t see Vietnam belong to me, do you understand?
06:23
It’s, it doesn’t belong to me because it took away my childhood.
06:29
It took away everything, it took my memories and though, but in another hand
06:37
the United States of America gave me new memories, new childhood, you know
06:42
new happiness, no worries, you know.
06:47
So they give me that, so yeah there’s a lot.
06:53
So your family was in Guam for a few years with the intention of going
06:59
to the United States after those two or three years did you then…?
07:01
I, you know when you’re a kid so I don’t know much.
07:06
I just know what they tell you.
07:08
So I guess when you are in Guam they call it “refugee camp.” So you
07:13
have to live there first and then if someone sponsors you, then you
07:18
get to come to the United States.
07:20
So our family was sponsored by the church and we were the first Vietnamese
07:26
refugee family that came to, to Oregon.
07:30
We were the first ones to step into Oregon.
07:34
Who, what church sponsored you?
07:37
Catholic Church and I don’t remember.
07:39
I just know that the churches in, in Beaverton, it’s a big church.
07:43
I just don’t remember, I, I never asked.
07:47
I just know that the church sponsored us, yeah.
07:50
And do you know if your family was selected because of, of your father’s
07:56
position; you mentioned that he was…
07:58
I don’t think so.
07:59
I don’t think so because at that time, refugees, everybody have a sponsor,
08:05
a church sponsor family, and you know they don’t make it specialty
08:11
that because your dad whatever my dad do they don’t make it special.
08:15
They make, they treat everybody equal, the same, but because depends on what church,
08:22
where, what state sponsored those families to give them a life in the United States.
08:28
So we, when we left Guam, we came to Oregon.
08:31
We stayed maybe like a couple weeks at the church until they find us a home.
08:38
And we lived in Halsey Square; they called it Halsey Square at that time.
08:43
I don’t know what they call it now.
08:46
We were the first family there and when we came here, I remember I,
08:52
I get beat up and get yelled at.
08:55
The American adults tell me, “You go home!” and I can’t go home,
09:02
I’m just a kid. And I get kids throwing rocks and they’ll push you.
09:09
There’s a lot of things that children at that time go through a lot.
09:14
We go through a lot when we came to the United States because they
09:18
blamed you for their children, for their father, for their brother.
09:23
They blame you for killing their family and you’re just a kid.
09:31
You, so my parents doesn’t speak English, I remember that when I was
09:37
in school, I almost every week or every month I’m in the nurses office
09:44
because they beat me up all the time.
09:46
They constantly beat me when I was little.
09:49
I’m really, at that time I was tiny, you know; yeah, I get that now.
09:54
And you and your siblings did, did your siblings as well suffer that?
09:58
Yeah, all of us, all kids does.
10:02
American, at that time, could be very cruel because you don’t speak English,
10:09
you’re helpless, you’re just a kid.
10:13
You are forced to come to this country, but you don’t understand the reason.
10:19
You just know that something happened to your country and you have to
10:23
leave because your parents say so.
10:26
But when you come here, people, different color eyes, different
10:31
color hair - you’re fascinated.
10:33
You thought, it was the most beautiful country you could ever imagine, but
10:40
on the other hand you were being punished by them as a young child.
10:47
And so, you don’t go anywhere, you know, you, you just stay in your house and go
10:55
to the grocery store, you know, because our apartment in Halsey Square, our
11:01
supermarket it use to be a Thrift Way store, some kind of Thrift, grocery store.
11:09
And so they, you know we, that’s how far we go from there to there and
11:17
I use to walk from my, from Halsey Square to the school where 82nd here.
11:27
You walk every day; winter, summer, you have to walk.
11:31
And can you imagine, mother and father doesn’t speak English and
11:36
you have to hurry up and find a job?
11:40
It’s not like now, you get food stamps, you get cash assistance, no.
11:47
The church took care of us until we could help my father find a job.
11:51
And that’s when they do that, they
11:54
give us you know, we, we gotta work and when we came here all, all the children,
12:01
I remember, all ten children that can walk at age of five, we go pick strawberries.
12:08
Strawberry, that’s how my mom and us; that’s how we survived.
12:15
Because of strawberry at that time the law haven’t changed; there’s no labor
12:21
children, children labor, you know all that stuff; we don’t even heard of it.
12:25
That was the fun part of my life.
12:28
Make lots of money, summer money for our family.
12:32
So children, young children, we worked, all of us worked and that’s the way it is.
12:40
When I was young, I and my name used to be, I have a Vietnamese
12:48
name, a very long Vietnamese name.
12:51
And children were so mean they use to make fun of my name and they use to like throw
13:01
shoes at you because they can’t pronounce your name and they use to beat you
13:07
because they can’t pronounce your name.
13:10
And I remember one teacher, her name is Miss Star, she decide, she saw that
13:17
and she decided to change my name.
13:20
She’s the one that give me that name “Linda” and I kept that name
13:26
all my life since I come here. And that was my name, the children they
13:34
begin to start calling me “Linda.”
13:37
Did you appreciate that or was that hard for you because someone
13:41
else changed your name for you?
13:44
It make it easier for me.
13:45
Makes it easier for children, doesn’t pick on you and doesn’t matter.
13:52
You just laugh about it, you just go home and tell your parent, “you
13:56
know I got a name they, they call you this name, call me this name and they
14:03
call me “Linda.” And they don’t even call me my Vietnamese name” - and so
14:10
my parents just go along, it’s okay.
14:13
It wasn’t legal in a paper, just a nickname.
14:17
So that nickname has been with me till now.
14:21
Did your siblings experience something similar?
14:25
No their names are really easy.
14:27
Just my name is so hard to pronounce, don’t know why it is so hard.
14:33
They just make fun of it, you know.
14:37
I, I was really little, I was tiny for an eight year old.
14:43
And my brother, my two older brothers, I mean my two older sisters and my
14:48
older brother don’t have a problem and the little on after me is too tiny and
14:54
they, they don’t do much to them, but as us the older they try, you know.
15:03
You know, but you get over it, you understand and later on you understand
15:08
why, and which, I’m okay with that because I don’t blame them, you know.
15:14
War can bring ugly things to people’s lives and change people’s lives in so many
15:20
different ways, but, but I’m, I’m happy.
15:25
I’m happy and I’m glad that I have that opportunity and it’s done and gone and
15:32
I’m here and this is my country, so yeah.
15:39
And your experience in the refugee camp in Guam, do you have memories
15:45
from, from that experience?
15:47
Or where you also kind, kind of young to have any memory of that experience?
15:49
You have, you don’t, you just remember the only thing you, I remember is I
15:54
hate Guam because you, every time the wind blow when you walk by, they have
16:00
so many coconuts it just hit me in the head all the time, I hate that.
16:07
And people ask me, “do you have memory of Guam?” And I say, “yeah coconut,
16:10
I don’t like coconut.” I get coconut even if you dodge the tree and I still
16:16
get hit by a coconut, it was so bad.
16:19
That’s all I have memories of that, otherwise the beach, children.
16:24
You play, you know, you’re just being an innocent children.
16:28
I, I don’t, I just remember that, but nothing else, yeah.
16:34
So then you and your family came to the United States in the late 1970’s?
16:38
19, beginning in 1975.
16:42
Okay, so then that means that you, if you were in Guam for a few years
16:45
then you left Vietnam in the early
16:50
1970’s?
16:52
Early, no we, we lived in Guam in
16:59
1975, no we came to, to Guam in
17:04
‘75.
17:04
If I remember, I don’t remember the month.
17:07
I just know it’s the earliest year, not, not the latest month, the earliest month.
17:14
I remember that, but we stayed in Guam for like three years after that
17:20
and we came to the United States, or is it we come, I don’t remember.
17:24
We just come to the United States in ‘75, I have no memory.
17:28
It was the 1970’s?
17:29
Yeah.
17:29
That this, that this happened, okay.
17:32
And how long did it take you to, to adapt in terms of feeling that it was
17:42
your home, does that, has that been a lifelong experience or as you were more
17:46
in the school system, after a few years?
17:50
I, when I like I said, it take a long time, but then after, when we came here
17:58
and then a suddenly we Vietnamese month and week people start coming, you know.
18:05
Start coming to the United States.
18:08
And we have the community, everybody lived in Halsey Square; Vietnam was,
18:15
I mean Halsey Square was Vietnam city.
18:18
And we were very close, we were like keeping an eye on each other and like
18:24
this is how we teach each other, you know.
18:28
Our people, we have to tell them, this is what you have to do, show
18:32
them how to go shopping, this is how much it costs, this is what, you know.
18:37
You learn fast, children learn fast, we pick up fast.
18:41
We transfer what we learn to transfer from one family to
18:45
another, we make it close.
18:47
The community was very extremely close, very, very close.
18:53
So I was, you know a children so you must adapt.
18:59
I pretty much in a year, but the beatings the, you know
19:04
prejudice was for a long time.
19:09
I think until, even when I get to high school, the prejudice was still there.
19:17
It was you know, the white American, you get older, but they won’t do anything.
19:23
If you get meaner and you get, learn how to protect yourself and
19:27
by that time we speak English now.
19:31
So at an age of 14, I was starting interpreting already and the
19:37
law wasn’t really strict so I
19:41
already interpreted for doctors, yeah, I do interpreting for doctors.
19:47
By the time I reached 16, I already interpreted for courthouse, lawyers.
19:55
You were working for them?
19:56
Or this was for your, on behalf of your family?
19:58
On behalf, I’m not working, volunteering.
20:01
I don’t get paid for this, you volunteer to help interpret
20:06
for your people, you know.
20:08
And your community.
20:08
So that’s, like I said by the time I reached 16 I already been in a courthouse
20:16
day in day out because American at that time they don’t know our culture
20:21
what we do, you know how we get sick and you do the coin on your skin.
20:27
A lot of that problem, they don’t understand is that they consider
20:32
it abusing our children, you know.
20:35
And a lot of people do things and they don’t understand the laws and so they
20:40
go to court and our family was the first family that came here and all the
20:44
children speak English so they always used our family for interpreting, you know.
20:51
So yeah, I did a lot of that, growing up was fast, but being children was fun too.
20:59
You had that part, but when it comes to, to when you go to
21:05
courthouse, you have to be adult.
21:09
Talk like adult and you realize, you learn that if you tell the
21:14
truth they don’t listen, you know.
21:19
You have to fib and make a little, put more spice on it, you know.
21:24
And there’s a lot of things that people don’t want to listen, just
21:29
because we don’t speak English.
21:31
At that time they, they abused us a lot; we go through a lot,
21:37
our people go through a lot.
21:38
The refugees go through a lot, even now, you know.
21:45
Do you and your family thinking back to that time consider yourself
21:50
pioneers, that you were the first and then you were able to give back to
21:55
your community and, and help them?
21:58
We don’t think that, we don’t, you don’t count when you help someone.
22:03
I don’t believe in that, I think I’m so grateful for that.
22:08
I remember, there was an elder lady and I was interpreting for her and I was
22:16
only thirteen years old and I helped her.
22:22
I don’t
22:22
remember what it was and she broke down and cried and she always tell me, “when
22:30
you ever grow up don’t ever forget where you come from because where you
22:37
come from is really important because it keeps who you are” - and I never
22:44
forget that. And no, I, I don’t think we are pioneers or anything, you know.
22:51
You, I don’t believe in counting what you do for good, you know, count.
22:56
You just, that’s what, we are Christian, I’m Catholic.
23:03
I believe that God bring me here for a reason, you know, yeah.
23:10
And how long was the time period, you mentioned that you and your family
23:14
were the, the first family to be here, within a few months did you
23:19
start seeing more Vietnamese families?
23:21
So it was?
23:21
Yeah, a few months.
23:22
A few months.
23:23
You start seeing people, one family comes, then don’t just come at once, they just
23:28
come one and then sometimes months or it’ll be a month, a couple, one month
23:35
will come twice, two families, you know.
23:39
They start coming in a lot.
23:41
So within a few years it was, was quite a substantial community?
23:43
Oh yeah.
23:44
And then you hear a lot of things.
23:47
A lot of people died, a lot of people, you hear about your country, you know.
23:56
About what’s going on and what the communists did and I think that’s
24:04
the reason why I don’t go back.
24:07
I feel that it’s, it doesn’t, it’s not, and they took it away.
24:13
Vietnam use to be free, you know when we had our own government.
24:18
Now we call it, it’s Ho Chi Minh City and it’s just weird to me.
24:26
To me Vietnam is, it’s just a memory, you know.
24:30
For people that lived and born here it’s a memory, country of your
24:35
ancestors born and I don’t see that.
24:40
I see just a memory for me.
24:44
People ask me why I don’t go back.
24:46
I said I have no memory.
24:50
I just, they took it away from me, we lost the war, you know.
24:57
My uncle died for our war,
25:03
you know there’s nothing.
25:08
And your parents and your siblings?
25:11
Never go back.
25:13
Well, my brother went back because he married a wife over there.
25:18
My brother went back, my father gone back because my grandmother,
25:25
when war was over and the United States come in, establish, then my father
25:33
decide to, my grandmother and grandfather decide to go back home because I still
25:38
have aunt and uncle there, I guess.
25:41
And so they, he went back like twice and that’s it.
25:45
And none of my, none of our sisters go back, none.
25:50
My mom went back once, one time; none of us go back.
25:55
We go somewhere else besides Vietnam, yeah.
25:59
So you mentioned that when, when you came to the United States that
26:04
you really relied on the community support, that you supported the
26:10
community, the community supported you.
26:12
So at the time there were really no options, there were no services
26:17
that were assisting the community?
26:17
No.
26:20
No, there is no like interpreter, none of that.
26:25
There’s none of that, there’s none of like, “oh you go to the welfare,
26:30
you get someone interpret for you” - that’s not going to happen.
26:35
You’re going to go out there and you’re going to try to survive.
26:41
It’s about surviving and there’s hardly anything until later down the road.
26:48
Maybe I would say about three years later we have someone that can, you
26:54
know, older and by then us kids, we know how to speak English by then.
27:00
We can speak English by a year later, you know.
27:04
So we just teach our parents, and my parents, the way my parents
27:10
work at is, like I said we dependent on picking strawberries.
27:15
My mother become a, my mom doesn’t have no education, but she’s the most, I think
27:23
my mother is one of the most intelligent women because she doesn’t have, at
27:29
that time in her time no education, no school, she doesn’t know how to read or
27:34
write, but she’s very good at numbers.
27:38
And my mother use to do janitory work, she finally got a job
27:44
and she worked and worked.
27:46
Every nickel and dime we have we saved in about after a year later,
27:51
maybe over a year, my parents bought a house for very cheap, they said.
27:56
Really, really, really cheap at that time; now it’s different.
28:02
And my parents saved up and bought us the house and yeah and we
28:07
continue to go strawberry picking.
28:10
May I ask where did you pick the strawberries, do you remember,
28:13
was it near here, near…?
28:15
No, they there’s a bus that goes to Halsey Square.
28:20
We go there in the morning, we would walk from our house to Halsey Square and wait
28:26
for a bus there and they would take us.
28:29
In matter of fact it was one
28:35
called Fuji, I still remember that name.
28:36
It’s called Fuji and it’s on Blue Lake.
28:39
It’s not far from Blue Lake and it’s huge, they own blueberry,
28:44
raspberry, strawberry season.
28:46
They have all kinds of berry, Fuji was huge and that’s where we
28:52
picked strawberry every summer.
28:55
We picked strawberry until all the berries being picked.
28:59
You named the berry - each berry has its own season, and
29:03
then apples and all that, yeah.
29:07
And not far we have here and all the way in Hillsboro really far;
29:13
the bus would take us everywhere.
29:15
And at that time, children can, it doesn’t matter what age, you just go pick.
29:20
And you were paid, the children were paid?
29:21
Yeah, oh my gosh, I, the last strawberry picking that I ever, ever
29:29
picked, I made a $150 dollars a day.
29:34
That was my last strawberry and my mom sent me to their friends’
29:41
house and I have to sleep there for Monday through Friday in the summer.
29:46
Then I get to go home on Friday night and then they take me back on Monday.
29:51
And you know Sunday night and we go strawberry picking.
29:54
Whatever money I make, it go to my parents.
29:57
How many years did you do that?
30:00
I don’t know, a long time.
30:02
A long time, very long time - until the law changed, I think.
30:09
Until the law changed that,
30:14
that you can’t pick strawberries anymore because you have to be
30:20
doing tax or something like that.
30:23
I think even when I get, get into high school I still pick strawberries, yeah.
30:29
At that age you can, you have a lot of fun though.
30:33
And in the strawberry picking fields were there other Vietnamese families?
30:38
Oh gosh.
30:38
Was that the majority of the people or were there other groups?
30:40
Oh yeah.
30:42
Yeah, I think there’s more for like refugee people.
30:46
I think more of all of us, all the people all over the world.
30:52
I mean, you know country, the war, Vietnam.
30:56
That’s how we survived, that’s how we get money.
31:00
Yeah, I mean there’s American, but they won’t pick as fast as we do.
31:05
We can pick fast, we pick very fast and I remember my mom’s hand is like
31:11
machine; really, really super-fast.
31:15
She make more money, she always come make fun of us all time for being too slow or
31:21
you know, yeah that was the best memory.
31:26
So you mentioned your, your strawberry picking and the work in the summer
31:31
time and then that you would assist your community in the court system
31:36
and the health system and school was very difficult, but were there
31:41
parts of school that you enjoyed?
31:43
Were there subjects that you enjoyed?
31:45
School I, my, my favorite is science.
31:51
That was my favorite.
31:53
I love science and my other subject was; I love laws.
31:58
I love to learn about laws.
32:00
I remember in high school, I spend a lot of my after school time learn, go
32:05
to courthouses and sit there and listen.
32:09
I spend a lot of my time in the courthouse and at that time our
32:12
family, by then in high school, I still working for my parents.
32:19
My mom she’s a janitor, she, she start getting job a lot of place like
32:24
restaurants; we go clean restaurant.
32:26
I would go clean when I get off
32:29
school.
32:30
I go there and clean, get home at ten, go to sleep, wake up at four
32:35
o’ clock in the morning, go clean up with your mom and then she’ll drop
32:39
you off at school and go to school.
32:41
And we would do that through high school.
32:43
I would do that all high school long and you just; you do
32:51
what you are supposed to do.
32:52
I clean a lot, so many restaurants, American restaurants, fast food that I
32:57
know and Chinese restaurant that I know we clean when I was in high school.
33:02
A lot of cleaning, a lot of cleaning, because that’s the
33:06
only way that we can survive.
33:08
By then we don’t, we’ve never been in the system.
33:11
We didn’t need food, we don’t get on food stamps, we don’t get
33:17
assistance from the government.
33:19
Only if my parents said we didn’t use assistance, only at the church, that
33:26
was it and that was, that’s all we have.
33:31
And we have food stamps, there was like a booklet of food
33:35
stamps, it comes in a book.
33:39
We have it for maybe five or six months and that was it.
33:44
My, my we worked and we make our own money because at that time they make it harder
33:53
because my parents doesn’t speak English.
33:56
How do you fill out paperwork if you don’t, if you don’t pay for the
33:59
paperwork you don’t get food stamps.
34:01
So we worked, that’s what we do, we, you know, work
34:08
like a team.
34:10
And you mentioned your mother’s employment, what
34:12
was your father’s employment?
34:14
My father worked for Techtronic from day one and he was
34:20
assembly, that’s all I know.
34:23
And he’d been working there until he retired or until the company shut
34:28
down, yeah, but my mom is a janitor and then because of her, herself and
34:36
only herself raising all the children and she in a few years later we, my
34:46
parents opened a Chinese restaurant, a Vietnamese woman opened a Chinese,
34:52
a Chinese buffet restaurant downtown by the Old Pioneer Square, we were,
35:00
we were there that’s how I in high school, that’s how I know so many police
35:06
officers because they always come to our restaurant and I end up knowing them.
35:11
So many of them become friends and good, good, good friends to this day and that’s
35:21
why I, I was so fascinated by the law.
35:25
And I used to work for this lawyer and I don’t even remember
35:28
his name, in high school.
35:30
I use to interpret for him in, in high school.
35:34
I interpreted for criminal law.
35:37
Wow.
35:38
Yeah, years ago back in 19, starting 1980 the Vietnamese
35:44
started coming in, but a lot of boys getting bad, gangsters was huge.
35:52
They’re not afraid of nothing, not like now.
35:56
Then, there oh my gosh you go, it doesn’t matter what bar or what
36:02
club you go into you are going to have guns shooting at you.
36:09
There was a Chinese Restaurant called [?] that was like the big thing for us.
36:15
There’s nightclub dancing and everything there, it’s like fighting
36:21
every weekend and, and gangster was huge, gang member was huge even the
36:29
one from Oregon, that one was huge.
36:34
My, my cousin owned [?] a building next to [?] . He opened that thing and it
36:42
didn’t last very long because the gang just come in and destroy everything, yeah.
36:49
They was bad, this is nothing, they said gang here, children
36:55
doesn’t compare to back in 1980.
36:59
It was huge, it was, it was like mafia.
37:03
Everyone, every person, you know carried a gun, everyone, yeah.
37:10
It’s, it’s,
37:13
yeah it’s big.
37:16
And what did you do after High School?
37:22
When I got, when I was in high school I went to community college
37:28
and I finished, I go there.
37:30
And at that time I was interpreting for a lawyer and you know when,
37:38
when you are young they at that time, they don’t check your ID when
37:41
you go to a bar, none of that so.
37:47
Oh god, I hope people don’t know who I am.
37:50
I use to go clubbing a lot at you know 16, I already go clubbing already.
37:57
And a lot of the Asian community gang, they don’t understand that I
38:04
helped, helping them interpreting for them; and so one day I went to
38:09
a club in Gresham and there was one gang member came up to my face and
38:17
he hit me and he pulled a gun on me.
38:21
And he’s calling me a snitch, yeah, and I didn’t understand.
38:27
“What do you mean a snitch?” “That I work for the police department.”
38:33
I said, “I don’t work for the police department.” So I finished
38:37
my school in community, I took off.
38:43
I left for a while and had gone to California and lived because
38:47
I was so scared, you know.
38:50
So I went to school there and worked there, yeah.
38:54
Where in California?
38:55
I live in Hayward, California just a tiny little town, tiny, tiny at the bay area.
39:04
So I lived in Hayward and then I lived in San Leandro.
39:11
I lived in Pino, Pino was my first town.
39:15
And this was in the 1980s?
39:18
Yes, 1980, yeah I left in 1980 after ‘86
39:27
I left, ‘85, ‘86 I left.
39:29
And how long were you away from Oregon?
39:31
I don’t, I didn’t come back until 1989 and then I went back
39:37
again to do interpreting and to.
39:41
For the court system?
39:42
Yeah, I use to do that and that’s, I kept doing it, interpreting.
39:49
And I just helped my family and just I meant to come back in 1989
39:58
just to make peace, you know.
40:04
Had things changed enough that you felt safe coming back?
40:09
That and plus,
40:14
I didn’t tell you the part is that in, in when I was in high school
40:20
I met a boy and he’s American boy
40:26
and
40:34
my parents start, my dad start abusing me
40:41
because Asian don’t go with white boy.
40:48
So then you, you left and you went to California, but then
40:51
your family remained here?
40:54
None of your siblings left, so when you came back they were, they were still here?
41:01
They still here, I come back to make peace with them.
41:07
To ask them why they did what they did to me
41:13
because I go with a white boy.
41:17
That white boy end up to be my husband for a long time and then he become
41:27
Asian, he started hanging out with Asian gangster and he start abusing me too,
41:37
yeah.
41:38
So then in terms of, your, your work and your interpretation then now that
41:45
you were older were you being paid for that, it wasn’t just volunteer work?
41:49
More volunteer.
41:50
It was more volunteer?
41:52
Yeah, I, I have a lot of compassion for people even no matter how bad your life
42:01
is or what obstacle that you go through.
42:06
You, you accept life, you know what I mean?
42:10
You accept life for what it is.
42:14
My parents disowned me for ten years.
42:19
Never spoke to me, never see me.
42:23
For ten years they never talked to me until I have my first daughter
42:29
and you accept all that and you grow up and you just accept everything.
42:35
And giving back to the community is something that you must do because I,
42:42
I’m a very compassion and I love people.
42:47
I love people and I love people - it doesn’t matter who you are.
42:53
You and me, we are blood.
42:57
Your blood and mine all run the same.
43:00
We’re brothers and we’re sisters, and the only thing that is different
43:04
between you and me is our hair our eyes, our skin, but deep inside I love you.
43:11
Even though I just met you and I see that and I’m so grateful for that every day.
43:19
That’s what God give me and what that old lady tell me to do, so
43:28
helping and giving is something you must do because that’s how human.
43:36
Now look at where we are, look how we are now as a society - we are so
43:42
short of humanity because we don’t even look at each other and say,
43:46
“hello, hi, how are you?” because why?
43:49
Just because we dress different or is it because we, we’re poor or is it because
43:57
we don’t speak the same language and that you treat me that way - no, don’t do that.
44:07
We need more, more of that.
44:11
That’s why I’m here, I’m here because I do my job when they tell me my duty, I
44:21
just don’t do my job, but I also protect this agency and I’m so grateful for this
44:29
agency because this agency has given so much to the people and each one of us
44:37
that walk into this door; I have been here nine years, and which each and
44:42
every one of them just incredible what they give to the people.
44:49
It’s just amazing, we don’t judge.
44:51
I know that when they come to AFC, we don’t judge no one.
44:57
When you walk out the door I will make sure that I am one less thing that
45:03
you need to worry about your life.
45:07
And, and I, I’m here because I make a difference in someone’s life and
45:15
I do know that I make a difference.
45:19
AFC give me a duty to do is to help people that are poor and people always said you
45:26
are a case worker, I need to know when you become a case worker, I want you to
45:33
tell me what the definition to you, what is your definition as a case worker?
45:41
Most people tell me it’s to help other people.
45:45
I said no, you are the voice for the people that cannot speak for themselves.
45:53
You are your purpose here, it is not just a job, it’s a duty, it’s a
45:58
calling, it’s the love and compassion that you need to give the people and
46:05
with no judgement, that’s how life is.
46:10
Our life, we are the people that should not have no judgement and
46:18
have to have humanity because we are short of that right now.
46:24
And I,
46:27
I love this agency because this agency gives that to the people.
46:31
There’s a lot of good people here.
46:33
Well let’s talk a little bit about how you became involved with the AFC, did
46:39
you hear about them and reach out to the AFC, did they invite you to join?
46:46
It was a really bizarre way.
46:48
I was, I was divorced by this time and my partner to be honest with you, I was in
46:58
a domestic violence and for a long time I don’t leave my house because of him.
47:07
And I was working; I owned my own business, I use to have
47:12
my own business and because I left, I left everything behind.
47:18
The only thing I took was my children and I start over.
47:23
I went back to school and at that time, you know, you’re getting older, you know.
47:28
You don’t, you can’t afford to go back to get your master’s degree, you
47:33
know your bachelor’s degree, you know.
47:35
You need money, so I go, I go to school and do nails, you know.
47:44
Was this in the early 2000s?
47:46
No this is, yeah, 2004.
47:49
I got divorced in
47:53
2001 or 2002, something like that and I went back to school and I
47:58
become a nail tech six months later.
48:02
And I, I couldn’t do, I couldn’t be in a system because he’s looking.
48:09
I don’t want to get him mad so I have to raise my two children by myself,
48:14
so I needed another part time job.
48:18
Nail tech, you make good money; you make good money at that time.
48:22
And I needed a part time job and my sister told me that IRCO
48:27
was hiring for part time only.
48:31
And I said, “okay, I’ll do it.” It was supposed to be two days a week
48:36
and I guess they loved my work and they asked me to do three days and
48:42
then three days come to five days.
48:43
What was that first position when you started?
48:45
Same thing what I do, energy assistant.
48:48
And, and I just, and I quit my job.
48:55
I quit doing nails and I still do nails on the weekend, you know,
49:00
once in a while I’ll do that.
49:03
But I got, then I got trained by one of the guys from, from Multnomah
49:12
County, his name is Gary, really nice.
49:16
And he showed me the way, how to help people and I was good, I was really good.
49:24
I was very good at what I do.
49:27
I you know, I used, you know, this agency give me an opportunity to do more.
49:35
You know, people come in to see me and you know they said, “Oh I need help,
49:41
my you know, my family, my husband, I lost my job and I have this electric
49:49
bill, could you help me?” And you say, “Okay” - you come in and you help them
49:54
and then they start talking to you.
49:55
They start telling you about your, their life and what they short and
49:59
what they do and I have connections; people I know from the past.
50:05
And I say, “Okay let me help you” - introduce them to another person.
50:10
You see, case worker not just to help someone, but you are their voice.
50:16
You are advocates for them.
50:18
You use that power behind the desk because when you send your
50:24
client out, they go to that place, the people don’t listen, right?
50:30
So who do you need to speak, me.
50:34
I call and I say, “Hey I’m from here please help” - instantly
50:38
I get help for my client.
50:41
I have one story about this one man.
50:47
I think six years ago, maybe.
50:50
No, not six years ago because it happened here, it happened.
50:57
One here and one at old one, but the one here I remember, maybe three years ago.
51:05
There was a gentleman, he walk in and he tell me he was looking for energy
51:12
assistance and he have a, he was bad- he had really, he use to have a really god
51:20
job, professional job, beautiful house, wife and kids, and he was down on his
51:28
luck by, you know, company got laid off.
51:32
Remember that, you know, they have recession.
51:35
Lost his job and then his wife left him, you know and so one day he walk
51:43
into the park and some kid or somebody mugged him and beat him so bad that he
51:50
was in the hospital for like a week.
51:53
A week long, and he come in and he need energy assistance to keep
51:58
his power on, so I give it to him and he broke down and cried.
52:03
And so what do you do?
52:04
You forget you have appointment, when your client sits there, each of my
52:09
clients I will tell you, when they walk in, whatever problem I have,
52:15
whatever issue I have, I’m with you.
52:19
I’m focused on you.
52:22
And I listened to him, thank God I did because he told me I was, we were
52:28
the last hope for him because everyone he go always turned him down because
52:33
you either need your children or you have to have certain things, you know.
52:39
And I said, “Well our agency, we have this, but you are here to see me.
52:44
I will do my best and I am one less thing for you to worry about, but I am here.
52:50
I will be here and I will be sitting right next to you and whatever the
52:55
problem is, let’s talk.” So we talked for like an hour and a half, come
53:01
to find out and I told him later and I told him to do me a big favor.
53:09
In all our life, everything have its meaning, everything
53:15
have its root to survive.
53:17
Water for plants, must have root, you have to have root and
53:22
water to nourish everything.
53:25
And I said, “Okay, now take a deep breathe, do me a big
53:30
favor, walk out of my office, I will take care of your bills.
53:35
I will take care, I will find you someone to help you pay your rent, but you have
53:41
to, before I can do this you have to agree with me, is that you will take a deep
53:48
walk and you promise me you don’t think of nothing and you surrender yourself to
53:55
God.” Whatever you believe, doesn’t matter what religion, you have to have faith,
54:05
you must have hope and you have to have to believe in someone, power than you.
54:12
Surrender to that, promise me to do it and he did.
54:16
He, he wrote me a long letter, he told me that he was going to
54:23
commit suicide if I was the last one, he was going to kill himself.
54:32
He said that he listened to what I said and I asked him to
54:36
do me one thing, is to walk.
54:39
And he walked to the Grotto here, he’s not even a Catholic, and I told him to
54:45
walk there because it’s really beautiful, it gives you peace, it gives you hope.
54:51
And hope that’s all we have, is hope and faith.
54:55
And he did, he walked, he said he walked for hours he said, and he cried and he
55:05
said thank you, thank you for saving him.
55:09
Do you see?
55:11
Working here gives me that and
55:17
that’s who I am.
55:20
I am the woman that speaks for anyone that comes to me; I am the case worker
55:29
that, I am the voice for the people that cannot speak for themselves because
55:35
we are that compassion people here.
55:38
I am really grateful for that.
55:43
And did you know about the AFC before your sister mentioned it?
55:48
You never?
55:49
No, never heard of AFC, don’t even know IRCO nothing because like I said
55:54
IRCO never exist to us, in our family.
55:58
And the building or IRCO building was building here.
56:03
We, I drove by there when it opened back in I don’t remember what year and I
56:09
saw that building and I, we never think of it, you know, never heard of them.
56:14
I, I didn’t know nothing about this agency and I usually don’t, I never speak
56:21
Vietnamese, but I, but I speak Vietnamese fluently, you know and I, I didn’t know.
56:30
I learned a lot here, I learned a lot about, a lot of our culture change
56:36
and the people change, you know.
56:41
And your, your position is within the anti-poverty department, correct?
56:46
Yes, yes.
56:47
Can you explain a little bit about that department and you already mentioned
56:52
what you do, but can you talk a little bit more about how the service works?
56:57
Oh, the way the service works is that it, you have to meet the guidelines.
57:02
There’s guidelines that you have to meet because there’s Federal
57:06
guidelines and state guidelines, but they are both the same, same thing.
57:10
Same amount, you have to reach, meet the income.
57:13
So if you have, you need help with your utility bill and you are getting ready
57:20
to be disconnected, you don’t have no way of paying it so they called in, now
57:26
they use, they have to call in to be on a waiting list because I am by
57:31
myself . I, I do, I scheduling clients; I make sure I monitor my funding.
57:38
I do meetings; you know, not, you just don’t do energy.
57:46
Well you’re supposed to just do energy, but any some reason energy always ends up
57:52
to be counseling other people, you know.
57:56
You just don’t, my job I don’t just give them energy, you just you give
58:01
it to them, but you educate them how to be conserve, how your utility
58:06
works, how your water works, you know.
58:09
When we give you water discounts, how does it work.
58:13
And what they need to do, you know.
58:16
So my entire, my program is that’s what we do.
58:21
We give people, pay their electricity when they are in need,
58:27
when they’re in a bad situation.
58:30
Their electricity is getting disconnected or because they are on oxygen; that’s so
58:38
outrageous, the bill for oxygen, you know their, you know their life depends on it.
58:44
So that’s what we’re here for, it’s to help them.
58:48
And sometimes because we say Asian Family Center, they always think that
58:53
most a lot of American, they call and they go after you schedule them an
58:57
appointment, you go, “You do know I’m a white person.” I say, “Oh my goodness I
59:04
guess we have to find a way to turn you to Asian so I can help you” [laughs].
59:09
I always use that and I say, “No, this is an open door policy, we have no
59:18
judge in what color, what race you are.
59:22
If you need help we’re.” And the way our rules, the way we work is that we
59:30
don’t judge no one and we make sure that we don’t make you feel uncomfortable.
59:36
We make sure that you are, you know.
59:41
You need help and you don’t lecture them, you don’t belittle
59:46
them, you know when they’re down.
59:48
Sometimes people come in and they get so nervous.
59:51
They’re so nervous they’re shaking and because they are so humiliated,
59:56
so embarrassed, but when they come into our agency they feel
1:00:01
very comfortable, they feel so welcome, that’s what you want to do.
1:00:08
So that’s my duty, it’s to help people that can’t pay their utility bills.
1:00:15
And because you help anyone and everyone who, who fits the criteria
1:00:20
in guidelines - though because you are within the Asian Family Center do
1:00:25
you specifically reach out to Asian populations and Asian communities?
1:00:29
No.
1:00:29
No, it’s the program is for?
1:00:31
Everyone.
1:00:33
Everyone.
1:00:33
I don’t, I don’t just.
1:00:39
Well in the beginning when I first started, when I first started they only
1:00:44
Pacific Asian, API, you know and AI.
1:00:49
And like I said there was a gentleman
1:00:52
and he worked with the county and he’s the, he worked at the county.
1:00:56
The state funds them and we contract with them and he told me, he said, I go, “Oh
1:01:03
this is money, who does it belong to?” He said, “It doesn’t belong to anyone”
1:01:08
- it is, he explained to me what it is.
1:01:11
API what is it for, the population, but if you want to help, it’s
1:01:16
there to do whatever, so I start opening it up to everyone.
1:01:23
And he backed me up on funding, the more I do it, I go, “Oh, oh if I
1:01:30
spent this amount we allocate this amount.” One year when I first started
1:01:36
I didn’t understand how it worked.
1:01:39
If you, they give you, for example they give you, they allocate fifty thousand
1:01:42
for six months and you take that fifty thousand, you keep on stretching out your,
1:01:49
you know your hours, your times, you know.
1:01:52
Then you just, you know to last that long.
1:01:57
But when I first started, the person that trained me, she
1:02:00
wasn’t that great, you know.
1:02:03
So I, he trained me, he teach me so he give me seventy five thousand, I said,
1:02:11
“Oh I spent it all.” He go, “Oh do you want more, do you have more people?” I
1:02:14
said, “Please I have a lot of people.” So my first years, I bring in like a hundred
1:02:21
and fifty thousand for one program.
1:02:25
I was like this is good, so I, I did the second years I went over two
1:02:33
hundred some thousand, this is one.
1:02:36
I have three, okay; I have federal, state, PG, and Pacific.
1:02:44
Then my, my, my second years I did two hundred thousand and then my
1:02:51
third year, I made a million myself.
1:02:57
I run this program, pretty, at AFC by myself.
1:03:03
I do scheduling; I work a lot, a lot of hours.
1:03:12
Agency that’s big, agency they come in they want to do how many applications,
1:03:17
maybe ten a day, maybe less.
1:03:23
I do like twenty, twenty two, whatever I can do.
1:03:27
I do that many a day, I see that many families, you know, I’m
1:03:34
you know, you have the money; I have the strength to do it now.
1:03:40
That’s why I’m breathing because right now I have like seventy something
1:03:45
call today and you know if I go, if I stay, now I stay late to schedule
1:03:52
appointments so that way people can get in because a lot of people don’t have
1:03:57
electricity and so that’s what I do.
1:04:00
So has the program, you’ve definitely been able to help more people and spend
1:04:07
more money, do you foresee in the future maybe having an extra person assist you?
1:04:13
That’s always, I would love that.
1:04:16
I would love that, but the problem is, it’s hard because the funding, you know.
1:04:21
And it’s hard for us to, it’s really kind of hard because by the time when they’re
1:04:28
ready to get me an assistant and I’m by myself, I have to train the new employee
1:04:35
and you have to be very, very careful because I’m you know, there’s no time
1:04:44
for you to, to make mistakes because you make a mistake, you that money can be
1:04:50
taken away or the agency have to pay out.
1:04:54
We have to pay out if we made a mistake and we pay, we spend over.
1:04:59
There’s a lot of things that people need to learn, you know documents,
1:05:03
you know that we need from clients.
1:05:07
We don’t just give you the money, we need documents because we do get audited by the
1:05:13
state and the federal and you know this agency comes first, you know, even though
1:05:19
we love to help, but we need to understand that I do work for this agency and
1:05:25
this agency is here to help the people.
1:05:29
I don’t want to make one person to get me in trouble, you know what I mean?
1:05:35
Because I
1:05:36
have to worry about my funding, so in the future I’d love to have someone
1:05:41
to help me because I’m, I’m by myself.
1:05:46
I schedule appointments, I do intake, I go meetings, I have to monitor my funding.
1:05:55
I have to make sure the building is right, I’m the one person that do all that.
1:06:01
And when you call people to schedule appointment, there’s a lot of
1:06:06
things you need to tell them to do and one phone call takes forever,
1:06:11
and yeah, it’s a lot of work.
1:06:14
It’s a lot
1:06:16
of, especially in the winter is when I’m really stressed out, in the summer
1:06:20
I’m just more easier; it’s not as bad, but in the winter it’s what kills me.
1:06:28
And in, in terms of the community seeking your, your services in terms
1:06:36
of barriers do they, you mentioned that some people are nervous or they, they
1:06:41
may not be aware of if you’re able to help them, is that one of the barriers?
1:06:45
Oh, yeah.
1:06:45
When people just come in to ask for help?
1:06:47
Asking for help, a lot of people get nervous it’s because the embarrassment.
1:06:54
They get so embarrassed and then they get nervous.
1:06:57
That’s why my office is very privacy.
1:07:01
People that my coworkers sometimes they just don’t, but then they, they get it.
1:07:05
I explained to them it’s very personal, you know they need to be open with me.
1:07:11
I need to understand them because when I do your application I, after
1:07:16
I’m done, I have to send it to the county and they have to overlook that.
1:07:20
If I make a mistake then they going to deny me, then what happens?
1:07:26
I’m going to, your power is going to be turned off, then
1:07:29
I will feel bad, you know.
1:07:32
Every application I do I try to make it perfect, I want to make sure that
1:07:37
it’s guaranteed that you will get help.
1:07:40
And I’m very careful with that because I overlook at everything.
1:07:44
Energy assistance is one thing that you need to be more careful; you know and
1:07:51
don’t just give it to them and just no.
1:07:55
You, people get nervous is a lot of them are because they’re new at the
1:08:00
program and then, you know the people get nervous it’s because they have children.
1:08:07
They’re scared for their children, they you know, you don’t want your children
1:08:12
to be known that you, you lost your job and you failed their electricity.
1:08:17
You don’t want them to worry that, you want, you don’t want any of that.
1:08:23
And there’s a lot of families, not a lot of clients abuse the system
1:08:27
to, you know I explained to them, you know I do understand your low
1:08:32
income, I understand that, but all of us we have to do our part, you know.
1:08:39
You have money to pay it, why are you not paying it?
1:08:42
You, you live in subsidized housing already, you pay a hundred dollar,
1:08:46
fifty dollar, twelve dollar, and you’re telling me that you can’t
1:08:49
pay something and now your power is disconnected and you’re yelling at me?
1:08:55
They will come and yell at you, or cuss at you.
1:08:58
I get a lot of that and I would tell them, “I’ll turn you on not because of
1:09:04
you; I’ll turn you on because of your children.” They didn’t ask to come to
1:09:10
this world.
1:09:12
We’re adults; they’re my children too, like I said.
1:09:17
You, there’s a lot of people, a lot of people who abuse the system.
1:09:21
A lot of people live in, come in here and a lot of people making
1:09:26
seventy thousand dollars they still want to get assistance, oh yeah.
1:09:30
There’s a lot of that too.
1:09:32
Wow.
1:09:33
Yeah.
1:09:34
So are there other organizations that provide a similar service that you do?
1:09:38
Oh yeah, there’s fifteen different agencies in Multnomah County.
1:09:43
Our agency we have two, AFC and Africa House.
1:09:49
I have another co-ed her name is Salome and she do half that.
1:09:53
She do half and half; half energy assistance and have rental and, but AFC
1:10:01
we do, we do the most here.
1:10:04
Do you work within a certain geographic range of, of people that you assist?
1:10:10
It’s the city of Portland or, or the county?
1:10:13
Only Multnomah County, as a matter, from Multnomah County all the way downtown,
1:10:19
all the way to Troutdale, all the way up.
1:10:23
We don’t rent in Clackamas, we don’t do Washington County, you know.
1:10:27
They have their own funder so we do only Multnomah County.
1:10:33
Multnomah County is huge and there’s twelve of us, yeah.
1:10:38
How do people find out about your service, do you reach out to
1:10:41
them or are they referred to you?
1:10:42
Well there’s a place called 211 Information, my name,
1:10:47
our name is on there.
1:10:48
There’s brochures for Multnomah County and you know 211, most 211
1:10:54
refer to you, to us.
1:10:56
And sometimes one person knows somebody or like a case worker calls from a
1:11:02
hospital for example, I do this a lot.
1:11:05
Hospital at OHSU, okay, case worker at OHSU knows a Vietnamese person and, and
1:11:12
said, “Oh we don’t know where to go” - and they refer to us and that case worker
1:11:17
go, “Do you do anybody else?” and I said, “It’s an open door“ - it doesn’t matter.
1:11:22
And they go, “Can I use?” “Yeah sure” - that’s what your job is.
1:11:25
Your job, you see, you see your client and you understand your client and refer them
1:11:30
to me, email me and see what I can do.
1:11:34
I work a lot with OHSU, Emanuel Hospital, I do few at Providence.
1:11:42
I go to them, I would drive to the hospital because I need their
1:11:48
signature, I need their paperwork because some cannot leave the house.
1:11:52
I do a lot of home visits with seniors that are homebound, that can’t
1:11:58
leave their home and when I have big
1:12:02
quantity of funding I send the application.
1:12:05
If I know that I’m short and I have this distance, I have to run and
1:12:08
get them to help them and hurry and come back because I know that I
1:12:12
need to guarantee that they get out.
1:12:14
So I don’t just, sometimes I sit in the office, no, I go out there too.
1:12:20
You’re out in the community, reaching out to them?
1:12:23
You don’t have to do it, but who’s going to do it for them?
1:12:28
You wanted to make sure they, they feel safe.
1:12:32
That’s your job, that’s our job, that’s the job of IRCO.
1:12:38
This is, who they are, they’re here I don’t know what year, I
1:12:44
should know, they’re going to kill me if they find out [laughs].
1:12:45
Well the AFC
1:12:48
was established in the early to mid-90s, so you’ve been with them for?
1:12:53
For nine years.
1:12:54
For nine years now?
1:12:55
Yeah.
1:12:55
About half the time.
1:12:57
And because IRCO and AFC especially provides so many different services
1:13:03
do you find that within the different programs, the different departments, you
1:13:07
refer each other - so you will listen to someone’s story and then if they
1:13:11
have children, would you maybe refer them to some of your youth programs?
1:13:15
Yes, that’s why we’re here.
1:13:17
Yes, come back to it, we are the voice for the people.
1:13:22
So yes, you, if people go to school to become, they say, “I want to be a social
1:13:31
service” - and I run into a lot of that because I do nails and their children
1:13:37
go, “I’m going to school to become a social worker” - and one thing I will
1:13:42
tell them, “Please when you become a social service, a case worker don’t
1:13:50
forget why you go to school there for.
1:13:54
Don’t think about money, how much they pay you, always remember to be the
1:14:01
voice for the people of the purpose of what you’re going to school for.”
1:14:07
I always tell them that, so if they go to school to become a social worker,
1:14:11
that’s what I always tell them.
1:14:14
Don’t forget where you come from and just because you have the power sitting
1:14:19
behind a desk, don’t use that, don’t use that on them because I see that.
1:14:25
When I see, go to DHS and I see a lot of people do that because it’s a job, it’s
1:14:30
about controlling; no, don’t do that.
1:14:33
I don’t believe in that, don’t use your power to do that to people when they are
1:14:39
down and hit bottom because you don’t know what behind the wall, you know.
1:14:48
I, I, I work here nine years, I save I think four people, that don’t, do stupid
1:14:57
stuff to themselves, that’s a lot.
1:15:03
And over the years that you’ve worked here it sounds like you’ve seen an increase in
1:15:09
the communities need for these services; is it because there has in fact been an
1:15:15
increase or more people are just aware of the service and so more are asking for
1:15:18
help or is it a combination of the two?
1:15:21
Its getting, now
1:15:24
funding is starting, cutting the Federal funding is cutting, you know,
1:15:28
more, you know a lot of funding cutting is shorter than last time, you know.
1:15:38
Yeah they, its, its, its, it’s
1:15:45
pretty sad, I don’t.
1:15:52
It’s sad that you can’t help a lot, you know.
1:15:57
And you always go out there and trying to beg, you know they don’t know what I do.
1:16:03
I always, always call the county, “Can you please, please, please,
1:16:07
please help this family” - you know.
1:16:10
You have to give them a good, good, good story, yeah.
1:16:16
And right now our community is so many people because job wise,
1:16:24
you know a lot of people get laid off, poverty is a lot now, to me.
1:16:33
If you notice, a lot of people are homeless now because why they lose
1:16:37
their house, they can’t pay their mortgage because they lost their job.
1:16:42
They can’t afford to pay their rent, everything is increased, but
1:16:46
minimum is still there, you know.
1:16:49
Food is expensive, everything is expensive, but wages is short, you know.
1:16:58
I see more poverty people now, a lot of poor people now.
1:17:05
Well compared to the, the experience of your family when you first moved
1:17:12
here and there weren’t any services, do you feel that at least new immigrants,
1:17:18
new refuge, refugees, do you think at least the environment is, is a
1:17:23
better, a better community for them and that they have this services?
1:17:25
Oh yeah, and even to me, all the refugees that come now are very lucky
1:17:33
because there’s a lot of service here because American acknowledge
1:17:40
and a lot of poverty people now work in the government, you know.
1:17:46
And they speak out and now we are less more, prejudice, you know.
1:17:55
We, a lot of people because we have one person, you give one they
1:18:02
pass down, you call it, you know.
1:18:04
A lot of, a lot of people caring for each other and a lot of
1:18:10
people speak out for each other.
1:18:13
So yeah, there’s a lot of service out here.
1:18:19
If you’re low income you get what is it, health free, right?
1:18:24
Dentist, doctors, you can go get food stamps, you, you know.
1:18:31
And you can, there’s a lot of things.
1:18:34
You can go to a place and go look for a job to, to what is it, Work Source.
1:18:41
You can get, get help to help you get a job, yeah.
1:18:46
Refugee people right now, they, there’s a lot of service like
1:18:54
AFC; there’s job, looking for jobs for refugees, teach them how to
1:18:59
catch the bus, teach them to learn about how to pay their bills.
1:19:06
IRCO, that’s what they’re here for.
1:19:09
They give them step by step like teaching a newborn to walk again.
1:19:16
We didn’t have that then.
1:19:17
Right.
1:19:19
We have that now.
1:19:21
So, you made me realize something today, you did.
1:19:28
You made me realize that IRCO
1:19:33
is here, they speak and teach a new, teach their children how to
1:19:42
walk again, how to live again.
1:19:45
You just made me realize that, I never think of that, I didn’t see it that way,
1:19:50
but if you really look at it, you really look at it: every refugee that people
1:19:54
come to IRCO, to the main IRCO office, IRCO job is to teach them how to walk,
1:20:00
talk, and learn new things again, yeah.
1:20:06
They do all that…at IRCO.
1:20:10
And then when they learn how to pay their bills, they can’t do it because
1:20:14
they couldn’t find a job because they can’t speak English fast enough and
1:20:19
they have trouble, the case worker over there calls me up and says, “Can you
1:20:23
help this family?” “Okay, no problem.” If I don’t have money, oh believe
1:20:29
me, I’m going to go find it for you and we’ll find somebody to help you.
1:20:35
I won’t stop; people can’t say no to me, I’m good at that.
1:20:40
Well then, looking back at your childhood and now having children
1:20:45
of your own and seeing this younger generation, in your opinion are things
1:20:51
better in the community for them?
1:20:54
Yeah,
1:20:56
in my generation, our parent doesn’t say, “I love you.” I think I’m
1:21:01
almost fifty now and I never heard my dad say, “I love you” or my mom.
1:21:07
My children, this generation, we give them love, we teach them to appreciate,
1:21:16
compassion, mostly love and not to be selfish and we, we teach our children
1:21:25
to be free; then they, years ago, children that from a different country,
1:21:35
parents can be very cold, you know.
1:21:38
Not no more, our children in America now, they have so much freedom and they
1:21:45
know how to express their feelings.
1:21:48
Then they don’t know how, I know how to express my feelings, it’s because why?
1:21:54
First of all, I married to American, now I’m married to a Cuban, but I married
1:22:02
to American and I know that love is not just giving, giving, giving, it’s
1:22:10
also returning and not abusing it.
1:22:15
So I have two kids and I teach my kids values of life and learn how to give
1:22:20
to other people, not just yourself.
1:22:24
And I do tell my children, every day, and my daughter is 23 and I still
1:22:28
tell her “I love you.” In matter of fact, I just tell her just now today,
1:22:31
“I love you, I love you very much.” And, and you know my generation, we
1:22:40
would never hear that from our parents and everyone will tell you that.
1:22:44
We don’t hear that, it’s very rare to hear that and yeah I talk too much [laughs].
1:22:52
Well, that’s wonderful.
1:22:53
Well, do you have any recommendations for the Asian Family Center, any
1:23:01
ideas that you’ve had that you’d love to see implemented in the future?
1:23:09
How can you ask?
1:23:12
I don’t, I just want them to never stop.
1:23:19
Never stop, what, what they do right now is great, it’s beautiful.
1:23:26
I’m so busy with working I didn’t see that until I’m sitting here talking to
1:23:30
you and you, you make me speak it out and I think [laughs], is that not funny?
1:23:37
I just realized that.
1:23:39
I just realized,
1:23:43
this agency is beautiful, it’s incredible.
1:23:47
So I take it you foresee yourself working here for many more years?
1:23:54
Yeah, yeah.
1:23:55
I, I’m good with what I do.
1:23:58
I’m very good with what I do.
1:24:00
Sometimes I don’t know if my boss know that, but it’s not about
1:24:04
that, it’s not about him, it’s not about my boss, and it’s about how
1:24:13
I represent this agency and yeah.
1:24:17
It’s, it’s amazing, I never realized that about
1:24:24
IRCO teaches newborn adult how to read, how to speak, how to walk
1:24:34
into a new country, a newborn.
1:24:40
They teach a newborn adult how to live, how to survive and not be
1:24:46
afraid and learn how to express your feelings, yeah, yeah, they did that.
1:24:54
They have class for adult, they have class for
1:24:59
children, how to communicate with children and how to give,
1:25:03
not to be, how do you say that?
1:25:06
not keep everything inside, you know.
1:25:09
They don’t know how to express their feelings to their children.
1:25:12
Yeah, IRCO did that because I’ve seen them doing it because I have
1:25:16
class for that and I see them teach people how to catch the bus.
1:25:22
They give them ESL, to teach them how to speak.
1:25:25
They have class to show them how to spend their money, how
1:25:30
to value the money, I see that.
1:25:32
I never realized that, but I see that.
1:25:35
And so it, it sounds like several, several decades ago it was very much about
1:25:41
survival, but now it’s more than that.
1:25:43
Now it’s about thriving too, the IRCO helps people thrive not just barely
1:25:49
survive, but really, really thrive.
1:25:53
Yeah, yeah.
1:25:53
You have interviewed all day, right?
1:25:56
How long now?
1:25:57
Ten, a week, a week long?
1:25:59
Overall, I’ve done about ten.
1:26:01
Ten, you did all ten and you, you listened to all of us speak and I see
1:26:08
it in your face that you, you glow, you glow with so much compassion and that you
1:26:17
and I, we learned something about IRCO and I think that’s, isn’t that great?
1:26:24
I think that’s so great.
1:26:26
Yeah, I will be here for a while.
1:26:29
I hope this agency will be here, it will be here.
1:26:32
I know it will be here, yeah.
1:26:35
And when you interview all those people, I hope they realize like I
1:26:40
realized how appreciative it is, yeah.
1:26:46
Well is there anything else that you would like to share, anything that we’ve
1:26:51
talked about that you’d like to share more about or any closing thoughts?
1:26:55
Oh, don’t you think we’ve speaked about everything?
1:26:59
You let me speak so much, I learned so much and you made me see something
1:27:05
I didn’t see and didn’t realize that about my agency [laughs].
1:27:12
We’re not just IRCO, we’re not just AFC, we’re more than that.
1:27:20
We’re more than, we are an agency that I wish we had when my family was here.
1:27:32
That can teach us how to walk and talk and protect us, you know.
1:27:40
That’s what I wish we had, but now we have it so there’s not much.
1:27:49
I’m, I’m really grateful for this interview so thank you, thank
1:27:53
you very much, I appreciate it.
1:27:55
Thank you not only for the interview, but thank you for everything
1:27:57

1:28:00
Oh, thank you.
1:28:01
I hope, I hope what I say is [laughs] I don’t know.
1:28:07

1:28:17
