00:01
Today is March 23, 2018.
00:04
I’m here with Dr. Philip Mote at the College of Earth, Ocean,
00:07
and Atmospheric Sciences.
00:09
Today we’re going to be discussing global warming, particularly as it
00:13
pertains to his research, but I like to start out with your background.
00:17
Where were you born?
00:18
I was born in Colorado.
00:20
Is that where you grew up?
00:21
Lived there until I was 5 and then
00:25
in Provo, Utah, until I was 13 and then moved to California.
00:30
What did your parents do?
00:32
My dad is a Presbyterian minister, well, he’s retired now.
00:35
My mom is a writer.
00:38
Did you have a connection to the outdoors as a child growing up?
00:42
Did your parents spend time outside?
00:44
PM: Our family vacations were usually about camping.
00:47
We did a couple of backpacking trips and yeah a lot of outdoors.
00:53
What was your school experience like growing up?
00:56
Were you engaged particularly through the high school years?
01:01
I didn’t get engaged until I was 24
01:05
[laughs] . No, I was a pretty studious kid all the way through.
01:11
I did sports, but not the marquee sports that get a lot of attention.
01:15
I did cross country and track.
01:20
Those are great sports because the cross country particularly you’re out
01:23
in trails and in the woods sometimes.
01:27
That was fun.
01:28
Then I got more into biking and started doing a lot of bike tours with friends.
01:33
Did you plan on going to college directly after high school?
01:36
Absolutely.
01:38
You ended up at Harvard, is that right?
01:40
Mm-hmm, I went to Harvard.
01:41
What influenced your decision to go there?
01:44
It wasn’t terribly well-informed or thoughtful, at least compared
01:50
with today’s kids who just have access to a lot more information.
01:54
I applied to four colleges and got into all four and I visited Harvard and I
02:02
was quite smitten with the historicity of it, just the red brick and the sense
02:08
that this is where George Washington’s army trained and things like that.
02:12
They’re just very old and growing up in the West where a building
02:18
that was 100 years old considered exceptional, seeing buildings that
02:24
had been around for 300 years or more was a pretty amazing experience.
02:29
It really had less to do with sort of whether I wanted the academic
02:34
programs they had to offer or whether
02:39
I saw it fitting into my career goals, because I didn’t have any at that point.
02:43
It just sort of seemed like a good place to go.
02:46
What did you think of living on the East Coast?
02:49
It was a good thing to do for four years and I was quite
02:53
eager to get back to the west.
02:55
You studied physics?
02:56
Yes.
02:58
What made you choose physics?
03:01
I knew I wanted to do something sort of sciency and Harvard requires you to
03:06
declare what they call a concentration, because it’s a Liberal Arts degree instead
03:10
of a major, it’s sort of a concentration.
03:14
You declare a concentration at the end of your first year and they do it that way so
03:19
that you have some time to think about it.
03:22
I wanted to do some kind of science and physics had the fewest
03:26
course requirements so it left me free to take a lot of electives.
03:30
Of course, what course requirements there were extraordinary difficult
03:34
and I really struggled with some of them, but I managed to squeak
03:40
through and go to graduate school.
03:42
Did you have experience as an undergraduate participating in research?
03:48
Yes.
03:53
I had a physics professor who allowed me to work in his lab
03:58
tinkering with electronics.
03:59
I wasn’t very good at it but he was nice about it anyway and it
04:04
helped me see what it’s like to be a graduate student, because I was
04:08
hanging around graduate students.
04:10
I got more interested in the application of physics to the real world and so
04:16
I took an oceanography class in my junior year and really liked that and
04:23
started just doing a little bit of research for the professor and then
04:28
won a fellowship to spend my summer after my junior year doing research.
04:34
It was aimed at physics majors and pretty much anybody who applied for it got it
04:38
and I said I want to do oceanography.
04:41
I got to spend a summer doing oceanography.
04:42
I was mostly doing programming and analyzing data but I got to go to Sefer
04:47
for 10 days off the coast of California.
04:51
That was a really terrific experience being able to be around professional
04:58
researchers, all oceanographers of course, and spend every waking
05:04
moment with them and hearing how they talked about their work.
05:07
It was pretty exciting.
05:08
That’s when I decided I really wanted to be a scientist.
05:12
That’s also when I decided I wanted to study atmospheric
05:14
sciences and oceanography.
05:18
You mentioned you went back west after your degree.
05:22
Did you wait to go to graduate school?
05:24
I did.
05:25
I took two years off between college and graduate school.
05:27
It was a very good decision.
05:29
I just had a sense as I was approaching graduation every time I prayed about
05:36
my future, don’t just go straight into graduate school and so I taught high
05:43
school for two years and that was a really good way of starting to give back.
05:47
When you’re a student it becomes very self-focused.
05:52
You’re concerned about your grades and your work and that’s important.
05:55
That’s part of how you get motivated, but there’s a natural
06:00
gravitational pull toward the self.
06:02
When you’re a teacher, it’s quite the opposite.
06:04
It always has to be about the kids.
06:06
That was really good for me personally to do that.
06:11
Originally, I was just going to do it for one year, but it turned into two
06:16
but I’d already decided that I wanted to go to graduate school and I’d already
06:19
picked the University of Washington.
06:21
Once the two years were up that’s what I did.
06:24
Did you consider, did you want to continue teaching I suppose after that
06:29
experience in the future, post graduate school or were you pretty focused on—?
06:37
As much as I enjoyed teaching high school, I knew that’s not what I wanted
06:40
to do for a career and I was interested in a faculty position but we had
06:47
geographic constraints and things just didn’t work out for getting a faculty
06:51
position until quite a bit later.
06:55
You went to the University of Washington for your Ph.D.?
06:58
That’s right.
06:59
I did my Ph.D. in a little over four years, accelerated by the fact that we
07:03
had our first kid and I was under pressure to get out and get a job and then I did
07:11
a post-doc in Edenborough, Scotland, and then we moved back to Seattle.
07:16
As a Ph.D. student, you studied stratospheric water vapor models?
07:20
That’s right.
07:24
A very arcane topic that would pretty much end any conversation.
07:30
Can you talk about the importance of understanding phenomena
07:33
occurring in the stratosphere?
07:34
At the time part of the reason I got involved in atmospheric science in the
07:40
mid-‘80s was that the ozone hole had just been discovered in 1985 and it was
07:45
this big mystery and then by 1987 it had been shown that it was because of
07:51
human activity producing these chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons that were wonderful
07:57
for all sorts of purposes but they were accumulating in the stratosphere
08:00
and then a through complicated a set of processes created the ozone
08:05
hole over Antarctica every October.
08:08
I got really interested in this concept that humans could
08:11
reshape the planet on that scale.
08:14
It was just completely baffling to me that we could put stuff into the
08:18
atmosphere in ways that were detectible.
08:23
I got interested in climate change and ozone depletion and my advisor
08:28
assigned me to work on this project with stratospheric water vapor, which
08:31
wasn’t really what I wanted to do but it gave me the opportunity to play
08:34
around with climate models, which turned out to be a good experience.
08:39
It sounds like anthropogenic climate change was already an
08:42
area of interest by that point?
08:43
Yeah, definitely.
08:45
I applied for graduate school in 1987 as I was finishing college and
08:51
summer of ’88 was extraordinarily hot.
08:54
That was when Jim Hansen testified to the senate global warming is here on cover
09:00
stories on all sorts of major magazines.
09:03
I was already interested at that point but that was sort of a
09:05
turning point in the national conversation about climate change.
09:10
I wanted to study that for graduate school and I arrived at UW in the fall
09:13
of ’89 and there weren’t really projects on climate change per se, so I did a
09:21
project on stratospheric water vapor and how that might change with the changing
09:26
climate and it turned out to be very interesting and led to several more
09:30
years of research along those lines.
09:33
How do you think your physics perspective benefited your sturdies,
09:38
or in moving into atmospheric sciences?
09:41
Physics is excellent preparation for atmospheric sciences or physical
09:45
oceanography and many of the entering graduate students with me came from
09:50
physics or applied math backgrounds, so it made it easier to just understand the
09:57
basics of atmospheric physics both on very large scales and very small scales.
10:03
Then you went to University of Edinburgh, as you mentioned, for postdoc?
10:07
Yeah, 2 ½
10:11
years in Scotland.
10:12
It was quite a great experience living overseas and we had our second child
10:17
there and gave her a Scottish name and so we came back with 2 little kids
10:23
who didn’t remember, unfortunately, don’t remember living there but they
10:30
still have an affinity for Scotland.
10:32
You worked on your part of research on the atmospheric tape recorder, is that right?
10:41
Right.
10:41
The atmospheric tape recorder was a name given by a professor at Cambridge
10:46
University to a phenomena of stratospheric water vapor that he postulated would exist
10:51
and then I found it in satellite data and we wrote a couple of papers together
10:59
sort of describing this phenomenon and we gave it the name that he had, so
11:05
we titled the paper “atmospheric tape recorder,” to reflect the fact that
11:10
he had predicted that it would exist.
11:12
Can you talk about the importance of this finding?
11:15
Well, it hoped to clarify a whole lot of aspects of how the air moves
11:21
in the stratosphere, how it enters the stratosphere and what kind of
11:25
restrictions there are in the pathways for air to get into the stratosphere.
11:30
Basically the mechanism is in the tropics at about 10 miles above the
11:36
service, about 10 miles above the surface, 16 kilometers, it’s above
11:39
the tops of the highest thunderstorms, almost all of the highest thunderstorms.
11:46
It turns out that region has an annual cycle in temperature.
11:51
It’s coldest in January because thunderstorms are strongest then.
11:55
It turns out thunderstorms are cooling that region.
11:59
So, what my colleague Michael had pustulated was that because it’s coldest
12:03
in January air entering the stratosphere at that time of year would be dryer,
12:09
because of course temperature controls the amount of water that the air can hold.
12:13
He postulated
12:15
that there would be dryer air entering in January and moister air entering in
12:20
July and that those annually varying amounts would be then be carried up
12:27
into the tropical stratosphere and that you could actually observe the
12:30
waves and that the air was essentially marked the way old fashioned tapes
12:36
would be marked by a tape recorder.
12:39
Indeed, the satellites, by the mid-90s we had a few years of satellite records that
12:45
showed that that was in fact happening.
12:49
Then, you returned to Seattle as a research scientist with
12:56
Northwest Research Associates.
12:58
Yeah.
13:01
Were you associated with the University of Washington at that point?
13:04
No, so Northwest Research Associates is a corporation that’s owned by the
13:09
scientists and exists to do science and it’s a great place to do research.
13:14
There are a few scientists who have some kind affiliate appointment
13:18
at the University of Washington.
13:22
I was there for about a year and a half and then I got a
13:25
job at UW and moved back over
13:31
to UW.
13:31
Why did you decide to join the Climate Impacts Group at UW?
13:37
From the time I entered graduate school I wanted to
13:43
do science that was societally relevant and I wanted to find
13:47
ways to be at the intersection of science and application of science.
13:52
I’d actually applied for a job at the Climate Impacts Group
13:55
earlier and somebody else got it.
13:57
It was somebody in knew.
13:59
He was a friend and I thought he was better qualified and I was glad that
14:04
they hired him because he was terrific.
14:07
They already knew I was interested in doing that kind of work so when
14:10
another position came open a year or two years later, they contacted me to
14:16
see if I’d be interested, and I was.
14:18
It was really exciting to be part of that work for 11 years.
14:22
I spent a lot of time traveling around the Northwest giving talks about climate
14:27
variability and change, El Niño, La Niña, pacific decadal oscillation, global
14:33
warming and its effects in the Northwest.
14:36
I talked to rotary clubs and school groups and gardening clubs and talked
14:42
at scientific conferences about their fields of science, wetland ecology and
14:49
hydrology and all those kinds of things.
14:53
I was doing a lot of kind of explaining climate science to others which in some
14:59
ways was an extension of being a high school teacher in that these folks had
15:05
a level of education that anywhere from 6th grade to post graduate but they
15:12
weren’t experts in that field and so I was explaining the basics in language
15:17
that any educated person could understand.
15:22
Did you anticipate taking on that role when you moved to the Climate Impacts
15:27
Group or is that a role that you enjoyed and cultivated while you were there?
15:32
Yeah, the role was originally described solely as outreach and I wanted to
15:38
maintain a research portfolio, so I said I’ll do this half-time but I
15:42
also need to be doing research and I also maintained the connection to
15:47
Northwest Research Associates and the funding that we had through NASA.
15:51
We spent one day every other week over at NWRA and then the other 9 days out
15:58
of 2 weeks I was at UW mix of doing research on Northwest Climate and
16:05
going out and doing lots of talks.
16:08
Your research was shifting from global circulation models to more regional
16:15
trends in the Pacific Northwest at this time, is that correct?
16:17
Yeah so I started looking at all kinds of observations of things: temperature
16:21
and precipitation, climate data but also stream flow and snow pack and sea level.
16:29
We also got interested in forest fires and the connection of forest fires to the
16:33
climate, which at that time had not been demonstrated, so we were really the first
16:40
group of people to show that in fact when you get a warm dry summer you tend to get
16:47
bigger fires and that seems really obvious but the narrative at the time in the late
16:52
‘90s was that the huge increase in fire area burn that had been observed over the
17:00
last 15-20 years was solely because fires had been suppressed for so long that when
17:06
they did start, they just got bigger.
17:09
Although that’s partly true, the warming trends generally had also
17:15
strongly contributed and we were able to show in fact the biggest
17:20
fires happen with warm, dry summers.
17:21
It led me into a lot of different fields where I didn’t previously
17:25
have any expertise and I got to work with people who were experts in those
17:29
fiends and publish a lot of papers about a lot of different topics.
17:36
How did you end up coming to Oregon State University?
17:40
Well, I had known people down here for a while and when the state legislature
17:47
created the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and OSU started looking for a
17:52
director I thought oh that sounds perfect.
17:55
I applied and got the job and it’s been a really great ride now,
18:00
11 years as director of OCCRI.
18:04
What were you initial impressions of the university and Corvallis?
18:09
Really terrific.
18:11
One of the reasons I was excited about the job was that OSU is a very collaborative
18:16
place and so I remember my first week on the job sitting down with a bunch of
18:20
colleagues who were working in a proposal and there were colleagues from biological
18:26
and ecological engineering, applied economics, liberal arts, and were all
18:33
looking at how we can—I think that was about decision making under uncertainty.
18:39
How do we study the decision process in the ways that science is considered
18:44
or dismissed in the decision process.
18:48
I remember just thinking this is great.
18:51
This is what I want in an academic setting where people from many
18:54
different disciplines can come together.
18:58
Also I really fell for Corvallis.
19:00
I realized that having lived in big cities for a long time I’d forgotten
19:05
how much I like living in a smaller town where I can hop on my bike and
19:09
in a few minutes I’m just out where I can hear nothing but birds, hiking and
19:15
just the smell of the fresh air and the quiet, but yet still things
19:20
to do when we want to do them: theater, arts, music, sports.
19:26
It’s all very accessible and there’s a lot going on here.
19:32
Who was important to getting you settled into this collage particularly?
19:38
OCCRI is a multi-campus institute and although we’re housed in
19:45
what’s now the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences
19:51
we’re physically removed from the main part of the college.
19:55
Although, now several faculty moved over to Strand since the remodel.
20:01
The people who helped me settle into the campus were generally not people in CEOAS.
20:06
I collaborated early and often with Denise Lach
20:12
who’s the director of School of Public Policy now, collaborated a lot with
20:17
Susan Capalbo and Andrew Plantinga in Applied Economics and Lisa Gaines
20:23
the director of the Institute for Natural Resources was a mentor in
20:27
just being director of an institute at
20:33
OSU.
20:33
Most of the people that I interacted with, especially in those early
20:36
years, were outside of CEOAS.
20:38
Now that I’m an associate dean in the college of course I
20:41
have a lot more activity and a lot more ties to the college.
20:46
Can you talk about the formation of OCCRI and its relationship to
20:51
Oregon’s Global Warming Commission?
20:54
I wasn’t here for the early history, but my understanding is that both OSU and
20:59
University of Oregon were interested in creating some institute along these lines
21:02
and they went to the Oregon University System, I forget what it was called
21:08
then, the Board of Higher Education or Research—I don’t remember the name of
21:13
the part of the Oregon Univesrity system, but they started talking to legislators
21:19
and found a couple of sponsors who signed on to write the legislation to
21:26
create both the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and the Oregon Global
21:31
Warming Commission which was tasked with helping Oregon find a pathway to
21:37
meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals.
21:39
The two entities were created in the same legislation house bill—HB
21:44
3543 in case you want to look it up.
21:49
It was specified that it would be at OSU and that was part of the deal that
21:53
they struck with the other universities that it would be here but that it would
21:57
include faculty at the other universities.
22:00
Is
22:03
it correct in assuming that there’s a policy element to this position, then?
22:09
Or do you feel pretty separate from that component?
22:13
There’s an expectation that this institute will serve the Oregon Global
22:18
Warming Commission and state agencies in some kind of science advice capacity.
22:23
We’re not equipped to evaluate policy or recommend policy and
22:29
we’re really about science advice.
22:34
Given your interdisciplinary coordinating role, how is your role as
22:39
a researcher changed with this position?
22:43
Well, I’ve had the opportunity to lead and participate in I think 6 team,
22:50
large interdisciplinary proposals.
22:52
By large I mean several million dollars.
22:55
They weren’t all successful but many were and so I’ve had the
23:01
opportunity to collaborate with lots of colleagues from other colleges
23:05
and even other campuses and usually though in more of a leadership role, so
23:15
it’s meant that I’ve spent a lot more time sort of managing research than
23:19
doing research and usually when my name is on a paper now it’s a graduate
23:25
student or a bunch of colleagues.
23:29
That’s just been one part of transitioning to more of a leadership position.
23:39
What is your relationship to the Climate Impacts Research Consortium?
23:44
The Climate Impacts Research Consortium is one of the OCCRI projects.
23:49
It’s funded by NOAA.
23:50
It’s a regional entity one of 10 around the country that are funded by NOAA and we
23:59
had several universities that participate.
24:01
We engage with agencies, federal and state, local and also with
24:08
tribes doing research with them to understand how climate change is
24:13
reshaping and will reshape their communities and their natural resources.
24:19
We publish original research but more importantly we apply
24:24
science to real-world problems.
24:26
We
24:28
initially won the competition to host the Northwest
24:34
Entity for NOAA in 2009, and then were renewed in 2014 for another 5 years.
24:47
Given your public engagement component, what have you found to
24:52
be effective tools in communicating science to non-scientists?
24:55
Maybe do
24:59
you feel like you interact with people differently when they’re members
25:02
of the public versus policy makers?
25:05
Yeah, with every interaction communication experts say
25:09
consider the audience, that’s #1.
25:13
When I’m going out to od a public talk, whoever’s invited me I’ll ask them what
25:17
can you tell me about the audience.
25:19
What are they interested in?
25:20
What do they already know?
25:23
so that I can hit their interests and meet them on their territory so to speak.
25:31
I probably like most scientists err on the side of presenting too
25:36
much data and not enough story, so that’s something that I recognize is
25:44
part of my evolution as a speaker.
25:46
When I’m engaging with policy makers, depending on their interest and their
25:51
level, there’s usually a question that’s foremost on their minds.
25:56
They don’t usually want to just a general what’s the state
26:00
of science of climate change.
26:02
Although sometimes they do and that’s what I’ll give them.
26:06
Here’s what we know now that we didn’t know 3 or 5 years ago.
26:10
But if they’re concerned about forest management, then I’ll talk to them
26:14
about fires and invasive species and if they’re more interested in agriculture
26:21
then that’s what I’ll talk about.
26:24
Then there’s platforms like Twitter.
26:27
I and many other climate science colleagues spend a little bit of time
26:33
thinking about how to explain the science that we do and that others do in 280
26:40
characters and that’s been an interesting journey as well, recognizing that in this
26:45
world scientists have a role to play in speaking publicly through social media.
26:53
Has your use of Twitter made you think about the language that you
26:58
use differently with communicating climate science since it has to be
27:02
much more concise but at the same time digestible for a general audience?
27:07
When I first started with Twitter I was so extraordinarily concerned about
27:15
misspeaking that I would spend 5 minutes composing a tweet to summarize a paper.
27:22
I was thinking I’ve got one tweet to explain this paper and I would actually
27:28
run it by a colleague who is more adept at Twitter and she coached me on how
27:33
to use hashtags and as I got a little more comfortable and then I started
27:37
looking at how other people do it.
27:40
This was many years ago now.
27:43
People were just firing things off and they didn’t always care whether it was
27:46
correct and in my view as a scientist I want to be known as a reliable source
27:52
that presents the science accurately and I gradually realized that I could
27:58
do that without spending 5 minutes per tweet and occasionally if I
28:04
misspoke, well it’s a platform that is just such high velocity that those
28:11
things tend not to stick very long.
28:13
It’s more important to who you’re engaging with and how you’re generally presenting
28:19
the science and showing its relevance.
28:22
Do you feel like it’s expanded the audience that you can access?
28:28
Yeah, definitely.
28:28
I mean, back when my—I did a lot of work with mainstream media throughout
28:38
my career, both at the Climate Impacts Group and now with OCCRI
28:42
and those are opportunities that just come along fairly randomly.
28:48
Maybe there’s something else happening and they want to get my take on
28:50
it or occasionally we’ve published a paper that’s pretty significant
28:54
and we’ll put out a press release and then that generates interest.
28:57
I’m still doing interviews based on a paper that was published
29:00
three weeks ago, for example.
29:04
But you know, over the years now with Twitter I recognize that since I have
29:11
a direct access to now 1,000 followers, some of whom will promulgate something I
29:18
say and so I do try to be careful in what I’m saying but also recognize that I have
29:25
an opportunity to provide interesting little factoids or perspectives on
29:32
scientific things that are happening.
29:37
Can you talk about how technology has changed over your career,
29:41
especially with your experience with modeling climate change?
29:46
I think back to my first job, my summer internship when I was a junior.
29:55
I had taken a class in high school on programming in basic language,
29:59
which nobody uses anymore but in basic you number each line and
30:04
then you can refer to another line.
30:06
It’s line numbering and so when I switched to Fortran, which is still a
30:13
fairly commonly used language for really large scientific programming problems,
30:19
you don’t need line numbers in Fortran.
30:21
You can use them if you need to—go to line 10—but I remember our computer
30:29
guy just sort of laughing because I was still numbering every line.
30:32
I knew I didn’t need to but it was one of those habits and over the years as I’ve
30:37
used scientific programming for other things I’m well aware that my skill as a
30:43
programmer is spotty and that my practices are atrocious and because we typically
30:54
just want to get the job done and so we’ll throw together some code and make sure
30:59
it works and it gets the right answer and we don’t care about having it follow
31:04
all sorts of programming conventions.
31:07
The language now I look at what our graduate students are using.
31:13
A lot of them are using Python.
31:14
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Python script.
31:17
I have no idea what it looks like.
31:20
I never even got onto the C, C++ bandwagon that started about 20 years ago, so
31:27
I program in something that’s called IDL—Interactive Data Language, which is
31:30
still commonly used among earth scientists along with MATLAB, but I find that it
31:40
takes a chunk of my brain that I almost never use and so when I start working on
31:46
a program it’s almost like heading out to run a 10k when you haven’t been jogging.
31:54
It’s like I just can’t get there.
31:57
I have to train.
31:58
I have to sort of work my way back into programming.
32:04
Then I’ll look at the computers.
32:07
I got into scientific programming just a couple of years after the end
32:12
of the cardstock era where you would have your entire computer program
32:18
would be on these cards, punch cards.
32:25
But we still used reel-to-reel tape for storing data and now of course I
32:31
have more storage on my iPhone than in a whole room full of reel-to-reel
32:36
tapes back when I was in college.
32:39
It’s really remarkable to see how not just the computing technology
32:44
that we use for doing science but the ubiquity of doing technology in the
32:48
ways that a lot of scientists are using
32:53
networks of people to do observations for them.
32:58
Bird watchers uploading their observations or people taking measurements along
33:05
shorelines and uploading their observations for scientists to use.
33:09
It’s really changed the way some people collect data.
33:14
We’ve actually used
33:17
the crowd sourcing to do some more climate modeling now.
33:21
Oxford University, Myles Allen specifically, had the idea back in the
33:26
late ‘90s to write a version of a climate model that could run on a desktop computer
33:32
and then look for volunteers and now that that family of computing projects, known
33:39
as climateprediction.net has over a dozen projects going on so we’re doing one
33:44
modeling the climate of the western U.S. and we’re doing all sorts of fun things.
33:49
We have tons of thousands of volunteers around the world who will run our
33:54
research for us, our research computations and then we can go analyze the data.
33:59
It’s sort of like having a super computer, only it’s a bunch of real people with
34:03
their own machines and their idle time.
34:06
What kind of dta are they collecting?
34:09
We send a complete set of software and data files and they don’t have to
34:19
actually do anything other than sign up.
34:21
It just lands on their computer, runs computations for several
34:24
days, and then returns the data to our server here at OSU.
34:29
What we’re generating is simulations of a year’s worth of climate
34:37
in the real world, so we’re using actual observations of sea surface temperature
34:41
to constrain what the atmosphere does.
34:44
Then we can compare that with what actually happened in that year and
34:49
we’re using a very fine mesh across the landscape so we can compare
34:53
what happens in the valleys and the mountains, can really see how climate
34:59
change is slower right next to the ocean because the ocean is warming slower.
35:05
It’s information like that that we’re using and then trying
35:08
to understand for instance how extreme precipitation is changing.
35:13
Speaking of the ocean, I was wondering if you could talk about your work
35:17
with the Envision projects in the Tillamook and Grace Harbor communities?
35:25
Some of the projects that I’ve been involved with all of which have
35:28
been led by the people have used the Envision model, which John Bolte and
35:32
his group developed many years ago, so one looked at the entire Willamette
35:40
Valley and incorporated all kinds of important factors, like urban expansion.
35:49
Our applied economists
35:53
provided enough information to model where the biggest cities would grow
35:58
and the conversion of ag land into urban, how prices, land prices,
36:03
affected those patterns and then the water demand that goes with that.
36:09
We also incorporated forests and the way forests are changing and will change
36:15
with climate change and then what effect that has on water, agricultural demand
36:21
across a whole bunch of different crops.
36:23
That was a huge, very elaborate project.
36:25
To my knowledge, it’s the biggest application of Envision.
36:29
Then we also used it in the big wood basin in Idaho to work with ranchers
36:35
and also with the cities of Hailey, Ketchum, and Sun Valley to look at
36:41
how water would change in the future.
36:44
Then two coastal projects in Tillamook and Grace Harbor, Washington, looking
36:51
at how shoreline change would interact with built infrastructure and community
36:58
resources like schools and hospitals and how different approaches to shoreline
37:05
management would achieve some objectives and threaten others, so if you build
37:12
a massive sea wall, yes that protects everything on the backside but if
37:18
the sea rises then you essentially no longer have a functional beach.
37:22
If you take a different approach to shoreline management is there a
37:26
way to preserve some of the inward infrastructure and also preserve
37:33
some of the beach functions?
37:35
It’s been a really fascinating tool for putting physical and biophysical
37:41
considerations into a common platform along with social considerations.
37:49
You referenced your recent publication on snowpack in the Western U.S.
37:54
Can you talk about the importance of snowpack to water availability?
37:59
Somewhere around 60-65% of water in the Western U.S. originates as snow.
38:07
It lands in the mountains and then melts sometime later.
38:09
That turns out to be hugely important to life in the west.
38:13
It’s just a fact of life that most of the west is dry in the summer very little
38:18
precipitation and so having water for cities and farms requires a combination
38:25
of reservoirs behind dams and also
38:33
snowpack.
38:34
The texture of the usage of those two types of storage is extremely different
38:40
across the landscape of the west.
38:43
On the Colorado River, Lake Powell and Lake Mead can store about 4
38:48
years’ worth of flow on the Colorado.
38:52
There are also many basins in the Northwest particularly where there’s
38:56
essentially no storage at all and it’s a purely natural river or
39:01
almost completely natural river.
39:05
The degree to which built storage can help mitigate one dry year or one year
39:12
with poor snowpack is quite variable.
39:16
But agriculture itself is a hundreds of billions dollars of year industry across
39:22
th west and a lot of that is irrigated.
39:26
That’s including all of the supporting economic benefits—the
39:36
suppliers and retailers and so on.
39:40
Then the cities of course, many of the biggest cities in the west rely on
39:45
surface water and so having one year with bad snowpack can really affect
39:52
the water supply in that basin in the summer and we saw that in Oregon in 2015.
40:00
Oregon, Washington, and California all had a drought that originated
40:04
because there wasn’t enough snow.
40:06
There wasn’t enough snow in Oregon largely because it was too warm
40:10
to accumulate and it melted early.
40:13
In Washington that was also the case.
40:16
In California it was a combination of very low precipitation and warm winter.
40:22
This illustrates that there’s a very real economic connection between the
40:28
warming climate and the way that we’ve historically used water and relied on
40:34
nature to store it in the form of snow
40:41
in the mountains.
40:42
What human or ecological aspects do you think will be most impacted
40:46
by changes in water availability?
40:47
You mentioned agriculture is that, do you believe that will be the biggest?
40:52
Agriculture
40:56
is a fairly adaptable sector.
40:58
A lot of planting decisions are made year-to-year and even
41:03
perennials, fir trees and other
41:05
things like that,
41:09
can adapt to changes over a long period of time.
41:14
But there are certainly big policy concerns.
41:17
Water policy and water management that are part of the stress for agriculture.
41:23
I think that probably the biggest economic impacts have come from things that we
41:27
haven’t even really anticipated yet.
41:28
I
41:30
look back over the last 30 years and one of the big surprises happened starting
41:38
in the late ‘90s and that was the outbreak of the mountain pine beetle.
41:42
Other bark beetles have devastated forests in the west and the first time
41:49
that happened it was a complete surprise.
41:54
I don’t think anybody saw that coming.
41:57
Biology can be a very surprising
42:02
part of the climate change question.
42:06
We understand the physics pretty well.
42:08
You put more heat trapping gases in the atmosphere, it gets warmer.
42:11
The physics is simple.
42:13
The biology is difficult.
42:15
We have invasive species.
42:16
We have complicated relationships between predator, prey, habitat, resources and
42:23
sometimes you’ll change one thing and it cascades through the whole system
42:28
and you’ll see a top to bottom change across terrific levels of behavior,
42:36
range, distribution, abundance of all kinds of species and so we’ve seen
42:42
this happen in all kinds of different ecosystems, some stressed by climate
42:45
change, some stressed by other reasons.
42:48
We can expect that that kind of thing will happen but it’s really hard to
42:51
predict what the next big change will be.
42:58
What do you see as potential issues that Oregon could face based on the Envision
43:04
project within Willamette Valley?
43:07
I understand that that being said there are different parts of Oregon
43:10
that will be affected differently.
43:16
One of the interesting results of that project was understanding the complexity
43:23
of water demand and farm demand versus urban demand and a lot of it hinges
43:33
on, and this wasn’t all just from that project but from some research at Portland
43:36
State University looked at water demand by neighborhood in Portland and there
43:41
really is a sort of local culture.
43:43
If everybody in your neighborhood lets their laws go brown in the
43:47
summer and that’s okay, then that neighborhood has much lower water
43:52
use than another neighborhood where everybody wants green laws in the summer.
43:57
That kind of thing really affects the water demand.
44:01
In the case of our project, displacing
44:09
farm land with urban land a lot depends on what the patterns of demand
44:18
are.
44:18
Indoor water use, whatever you use, goes back into the plumbing
44:23
and eventually finds its way back in the Willamette River.
44:26
If
44:28
you’re outside of the summer season where people are watering their lawns,
44:35
adding people doesn’t hugely change the total amount of water in the river.
44:40
It does change what the water utilities have to provide but from an aggregate
44:46
system it’s pretty complicated.
44:50
The other big factor, though, that we didn’t really get into
44:52
adequately was there are 13 dams on the Willamette River basin.
44:57
They’re all off the main stem Willamette.
45:01
They’ve helped really reduce the risk of flooding on the Willamette.
45:04
We haven’t had a really big flood since February of 1996.
45:10
In a changing climate at some point we need to reevaluate how
45:15
the spring flood management is done because what we saw in 2015 was very
45:22
poor snowpack and yet to avoid a possible March flood, the reservoirs were drafted
45:30
as normal but there wasn’t enough snow or enough spring precipitation
45:35
to refill the reservoirs so we went into what turned out to be a very
45:39
dry summer with very low reservoirs.
45:42
Everybody was following the rules.
45:43
That’s the way the system was set up.
45:48
The project flagged this is something we’re going to need to figure out.
45:53
It would take another pretty massive study to look at how the risk of
45:59
flooding is changing through time and how the reservoir management might be
46:04
tweaked to have a higher probability of filling the reservoirs in the
46:10
summer for recreation and other uses.
46:17
Can you talk about how you got involved with the inter-governmental
46:20
panel on climate change and what that experience was like?
46:24
The inter-governmental plan on climate change was started in 1998
46:29
to provide independent scientific advice to the international policy
46:32
process around climate change.
46:35
I was aware of it happening when I was in graduate school.
46:40
I got a copy of the first report which was about an inch thick.
46:45
Actually I have it on my shelf here.
46:47
Then in 1996 the second report came out.
46:52
In 2001 a third report came out and that third report was the one that
46:56
finally said humans are doing this.
46:59
It was much more confident than the previous two reports.
47:01
I used the IPC reports as references and to increase my own understanding and then
47:11
I was encouraged to apply to be an author for the fourth assessment report by my
47:20
long-time mentor Susan Solomon who was actually the one who figured out that the
47:26
ozone hole had a primarily human cause.
47:29
She had by that point gotten into climate change.
47:32
Had been appointed as the co-chair of IPCC, the physical science volume,
47:37
and she said we could use you.
47:39
I
47:42
had the opportunity to be an author for that fourth assessment report
47:46
which was released in 2007 and then shared the Nobel peace prize and then
47:53
I reupped for the fifth assessment report which came out in 2013.
47:58
You worked on the cryosphere chapter for that report?
48:00
Yeah, for both the fourth and fifth reports I worked on the chapter on
48:05
what’s called the cryosphere or basically everything frozen: ice, snow, permafrost.
48:14
Did that experience influence your future career objectives or opportunities?
48:19
I think it gave me an understanding of the value of a really rigorous
48:26
report process and also how difficult it could be to really wrap your mind
48:32
around all of the material around a given subject and accurately portray
48:36
what is known and what’s not known.
48:39
The fact that I happened to be on board when the IPCC was
48:44
awarded the Nobel peace prize
48:48
was kind of a good career move.
48:52
Completely inadvertent and unexpected.
48:54
I’m
48:57
always quick to point out I did not win the Nobel peace prize.
49:01
I was part of the IPCC which won the Nobel peace prize.
49:06
They mailed all of the authors a very nice rendition of the actual
49:12
prize recognizing the work of the IPCC rested on the volunteers who did
49:19
the work, even if we didn’t actually show up in Stockholm for the award.
49:23
It was a great opportunity to connect with people internationally and also
49:28
to be part of something that got this really fabulous recognition.
49:33
You’ve also been involved with the National Climate Assessment
49:36
Committee, is that right?
49:38
Yeah, the National Climate Assessment is something that congress requires every
49:44
4 years, requires 11 federal agencies to collaborate on producing a report.
49:52
The U.S. Global Change Research Act passed in 1990.
49:55
It was around the same time that the IPCC got going and the first national
50:00
climate assessment was produced in around 2000, so right around the end
50:08
of the Clinton administration and I was involved as the lead for the Northwest
50:14
report and the Northwest chapter.
50:17
The second report came out during the Bush administration and it was
50:21
a much smaller affair and then the third National Climate Assessment came
50:26
out in 2014 and it was a huge effort and I was involved with that again.
50:31
Now the fourth National Climate Assessment will come out in 2018
50:34
and I’m involved with that as well.
50:34
Now I’m going to move on
50:40
to some broader questions around climate change.
50:44
What were your earlier conversations on climate change like and how
50:47
have they shifted over time?
50:53
You know I remember the very first time I heard of climate change was this
50:59
class that I was taking in college.
51:01
It was really about the dynamics of the atmosphere.
51:05
Why air moves the way it does.
51:08
I remember the professor saying the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
51:12
going up and it’s a heat trapping gas so we expect that someday we’ll find
51:18
out that it’s been warming our planet.
51:20
At that point there had been a little bit of warming observed but it had sort
51:24
of, it was sort of in the noise level.
51:27
It was not what you could say was unusual.
51:29
Of course since then it’s a totally different story.
51:34
In the summer of ’88 it turned into more of a national conversation.
51:38
Then I found myself talking with people more about it,
51:42
you know just in the public.
51:44
Since about 2007 it’s become much more polarized and a lot of that had to
51:50
do simply with the fact that Al Gore took it on as a cause and came out
51:55
with a movie An Inconvenient Truth and he was going around giving talks.
51:59
So he did a lot in the way of public education but it also turned out
52:03
as an unintended consequence that
52:07
republicans and democrats shifted from being fairly similar in degree
52:14
of acceptance of science to having it become almost a tribal thing.
52:18
If you’re a republican you almost can’t get elected if you admit that
52:23
humans are changing the climate, which is a really unfortunate development.
52:27
The conversations that we have with the public now have to be much more nuanced
52:32
and have to recognize that there are political differences that exist and to
52:36
focus more on scientific evidence and on things that we know are happening and
52:43
that people can observe are happening and on solutions and not beating people
52:49
over the head with this is a catastrophe, these are things that are a moral failure
52:59
on our part but rather we want to leave a better planet for our children so what
53:05
role does renewable energy have in that?
53:08
It’s made it a much more difficult conversation to have in the
53:11
general public and even within the scientific community I think
53:19
it’s become a more challenging topic to study in recent years and a lot of
53:27
funding agencies are reluctant to be seen as sponsoring climate research.
53:34
It’s been a challenge.
53:37
Do you think that’s a challenge unique to American scientists in
53:42
the way that climate change has become politicized in our country?
53:47
Yeah, that is unique to the U.S.A. There are other countries where
53:52
there’s a minority of people who are outspoken about no climate change
53:56
isn’t happening or no humans are not responsible it’s all natural.
54:00
They’re a very small percentage of the population in those places and
54:04
more importantly there are no major political parties in those countries
54:10
that espouse the view that basically it’s all natural or we don’t really know.
54:17
Polling indicates that a fairly large majority of Americans
54:22
accept the science, something like
54:27
2/3, but that is not reflected in the halls of congress.
54:31
I should be clear: public statements from members of
54:36
congress don’t line up with that.
54:41
There are indicates that a great many politicians who publicly are ambivalent
54:46
or equivocal about whether humans are causing climate, in private they will
54:51
say yes, we know that this is something we need to be working on solving.
54:54
We know that this is a big issue but everybody learned the lesson of a
54:59
couple of republicans in 2010 who lost primary elections because they were
55:06
seen as a little too far outside the
55:11
party orthodoxy about this subject, which is, again, it’s really unfortunate.
55:18
You’ve already touched on this, but maybe you could speak a little further
55:23
about the community of climate change researchers at OSU and how that
55:26
institute help facilities that community.
55:30
One of the purposes of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute
55:34
is to connect faculty and facilitate research on climate topics.
55:39
We’ve put a lot of effort into finding out who those faculty are, not just at OSU
55:44
but also PSU and U of O on the Bend campus and even Southern Oregon University.
55:51
Reaching out to them and engaging with them, we created an annual conference,
55:56
the Northwest Conference, that rotates among Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.
56:01
It’s a good way for scientists to connect with managers, present
56:05
their own work on the region.
56:08
We’ve also facilitated a lot of proposal development efforts and
56:13
some of those have been successful.
56:17
Then we’ve had campus gatherings of all different sorts.
56:21
We’ve had monthly lunches.
56:23
We’ve had late afternoon get togethers.
56:28
We’ve had lecture series.
56:29
Every
56:32
year we look for ways to connect faculty and get to know what they’re
56:37
doing and see if we can collaborate.
56:44
Do you foresee diminished funding for climate change research during
56:50
the Trump administration and if so, how do you foresee coping with that?
56:58
Over the last several years, not just when Trump was president, the
57:04
congressional directions have been downward for climate research.
57:12
Agencies have tended to move away from being very explicit that it’s climate.
57:20
I think there’s probably some climate research that is ongoing
57:25
but isn’t being presented that way.
57:30
I think the bigger problem isn’t just political.
57:33
It’s the fact that the federal government spends a huge and growing amount
57:38
of money every year on middle class entitlements on servicing the national
57:44
debt and it’s just putting a squeeze on all sorts of discretionary programs.
57:49
I think science, generally, not just climate science, but I think
57:53
science generally is going to feel the squeeze more and more in coming
57:58
decades because of those factors.
58:01
What
58:05
policy changes would you like to see happen in the U.S.
58:08
with regard to climate change.
58:10
Do you have thoughts given your research experience on effective
58:15
changes that you think would help?
58:18
I think the first policy change is just recognizing formally climate
58:22
change is in fact caused by humans and
58:28
that alone would actually be a really huge step.
58:31
It would require the republican party to go back to where it was
58:36
10, 15 years ago on this issue and affirm more generally that science
58:43
has something to tell us about the
58:50
kinds of challenges that we are facing as a species.
58:54
I think there’s a 2-prong approach that’s needed.
58:57
One is to reduce emissions and
59:01
there’s been a policy debate for many years about a cap in trade
59:05
approach to reduce emissions versus a carbon tax approach.
59:09
States have tried both.
59:11
I’m really not qualified to weigh in on which of those approaches is better.
59:16
In Oregon and California because a tax requires a super majority, the cap in
59:24
trade system is the more politically viable, but on a national scale if
59:30
there were some way of incorporating the costs of carbon into the emissions
59:37
activities then economists say that would produce a more efficient economy
59:46
in that we’re currently essentially externalizing the cost of emissions.
59:53
Every negative consequence of climate change is not reflected in
59:58
the price of burning fossil fuels.
1:00:01
Whichever of those approaches is used to... or a third approach.
1:00:07
What the Obama administration attempted to do was simply pick away at it
1:00:11
through regulations, so vehicle fuel efficiency regulations, power plant
1:00:19
regulations, and that piecemeal approach was better than nothing.
1:00:26
I’m not really going to pick a specific federal level policy and say that’s what
1:00:31
I’d like to see, but there’s some very appealing incentives that have helped
1:00:37
individuals make choices to be more carbon neutral, incentives for electric vehicles
1:00:47
and solar panels are two examples.
1:00:51
Again, that’s just picking away at little pieces and really what we
1:00:55
need is some kind of comprehensive approach and energy utilities have
1:00:58
been asking for this for a long time.
1:01:01
They want certainty and it’s hard for business if they’re concerned about
1:01:08
what polices might eventually be enacted but they don’t know yet which kind
1:01:16
or once something is chosen then they can plan and they can act.
1:01:22
Do you have thoughts on changes to public education that could help Americans
1:01:27
better understand climate change or potentially change our behavior?
1:01:31
Wow.
1:01:32
I think more generally
1:01:36
it’s troubling that there are two connected developments in education.
1:01:44
One is this sense that everybody’s entitled to their own facts.
1:01:49
Certainly, everybody’s entitled to their own opinion but facts are facts.
1:01:54
Often facts challenge what we believe or what we want and the sense that you
1:02:04
can go on Goggle and look up your own set of facts and develop your own truth
1:02:10
is an unfortunate byproduct of both the ubiquity of information through
1:02:14
the internet and also the increasing tribalism where people affiliate more
1:02:22
and more with people who think like them and our own little Facebook communities
1:02:30
become these echo chambers where we all believe the same thing and we all get
1:02:33
mad about the same thing and there’s less of a sense that there are universal
1:02:41
norms and universally accepted facts.
1:02:46
Connected to that is a sort of erosion of critical thinking.
1:02:52
I would love it if every graduate of OSU was able to
1:02:58
grapple with the role of facts around a certain issue, whether it’s climate
1:03:04
change or GMOs or vaccinations or fluoride in drinking water.
1:03:11
There’s science around each of these issues.
1:03:13
In some cases the science challenges political beliefs.
1:03:17
If you want to pull a certain political belief in defiance of the facts, at least
1:03:22
be honest that the facts say this, but I choose to believe that in spite of the
1:03:29
facts instead of saying oh well, those 88 studies showing that fluoride is good
1:03:36
for your teeth, those are bad studies and this one over here is the one I
1:03:40
want and gravitate, pick your own facts.
1:03:47
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
1:03:51
It depends on whether I’ve had my coffee [laughs] . I’m
1:03:59
inherently optimistic but I would say over the last couple of years there
1:04:04
have been more and more occasions where I’ve just thought I’ve been at this
1:04:09
for 20 years now talking about climate change in the public and I remember
1:04:13
thinking 20 years ago that solutions were immanent, that we had the technology.
1:04:22
There was enough public interest.
1:04:24
It was so clearly good for us to transition away from fossil fuels for
1:04:28
so many reasons and the clarity of what we were learning back then about
1:04:35
the connection between climate change and wildfire, disappearing snowpack,
1:04:39
rising sea levels, surely would be enough to motivate people to action.
1:04:45
I remember having a conversation in 2004 with a colleague about why
1:04:51
haven’t people in America woken up to this and gotten on board?
1:04:57
What would it take?
1:04:58
I remember him saying a really bad hurricane season.
1:05:02
Later in 2004, four tropical storms or hurricanes crisscrossed Florida
1:05:08
and caused all sorts of damage and yet it didn’t really move the needle.
1:05:13
Then 2005 happened with Katrina, Rita, Wilma—the biggest Atlantic hurricane
1:05:19
season ever as far as we can tell.
1:05:24
What we’re seeing now, and there’s a professor here at OSU who’s done some
1:05:28
interesting research about the way communities react to natural disasters.
1:05:34
In fairly blue communities they’re more likely to blame an event
1:05:42
whether it’s a tornado or a flood or whatever, on climate change, and their
1:05:46
acceptance of doing something goes up.
1:05:49
What she found is in communities that are more conservative, they
1:05:53
actually have the opposite reaction.
1:05:55
Not even natural disasters that we can link to climate change are persuasive.
1:06:01
It
1:06:04
just underscores how polarized the issue has become and that I think
1:06:09
is to me the most discouraging part of this, is that the whole science
1:06:15
enterprise itself is now suspect because of conclusions that we’ve reached.
1:06:23
Well, that concludes our interview.
1:06:26
On that cheery note!
1:06:29
Thank you for your participation.
1:06:30
I appreciate it.
1:06:31
You’re welcome.
