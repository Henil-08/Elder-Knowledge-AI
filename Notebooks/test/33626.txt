With siblings and my brothers and my uncles.
03:58
And...we are all together.
04:04
I mean...we are Christians and we are Seventh-day Adventists.
04:08
My father went to school...finished his college in a Adventist Christian college.
04:17

05:25
What else is there?
05:25
OK, that was it.
05:25
If you wanted to say more, that’s also OK.
05:26
The question is just a starting point.
05:26
So if you have more to say after the question too, you can say that as well.
05:26
So what’s the question?
05:26
The...it’s just, can you tell me about your family?
05:26
Brothers and sisters?
05:26
So we have four children for my parents.
05:30
I’m the oldest.
05:31
Eldest.
05:32
I have two brothers and one sister.
05:34
And they all are...live in India.
05:38
My parents are passed away.
05:41
So...but we are very close family.
05:44
But we have...my mother has ten siblings or boys.
05:50
My mother is only one.
05:52
But two brothers, they have ten boys.
05:55
So my uncles, my aunts, we all live in the same village.
05:59
So then they all, we all...everybody got educated and then they are...you know,
06:07
schoolteachers, some of them are farmers.
06:10
So we are...when
06:15
we go home, then we all meet our cousins and distant cousins and everybody.
06:21
But otherwise, the...my village...my grandfather, my mother’s father, was
06:24
the...what you call...he’s...yeah...no, my village came is...James Patter,
06:43
which is my grandfather’s name.
06:44
And he donated some land to church and then...yeah, so
06:52
that’s the Lutheran church there.
06:54
And then...but otherwise, you know, friends and relatives, all
06:59
my village, all are more...my own people, than someone else.
07:07
So that’s the way you know everybody.
07:10
So we see them...everybody.
07:13
Not only that.
07:13
We are Christians from...you know, from last hundred years.
07:18
You know, my families…
07:19
Yeah.
07:20
...were all Christians, almost hundred years, you can say.
07:25
Yeah.
07:28
We went to all Adventist schools, I mean Christian schools….in
07:33
our colleges and everything.
07:35
I worked in a Christian...in the institution in Bangalore for a while.
07:42
I worked in Pune and Bangalore.
07:45
And Narsapur, where I grew up and
07:49
went to school.
07:49
Then I came to the United States.
07:51
OK.
07:52
In 1980.
07:53
OK.
07:56
So with that...so you talked a little bit about India.
08:02
Can you share a little bit about what your lives in India were like
08:06
or any memories, special memories about what living in India was like?
08:13
Well...our childhood is pretty much normal.
08:20
And then we enjoyed so much outdoors.
08:23
And we have...we have so much farmland.
08:27
We grow lot of rice and then...all vegetables and everything.
08:32
And then we are fortunate, we live very close to river and Bay of Bengal.
08:38
So...so we never had a food problem.
08:43
So...we had very comfortable childhood when we were growing up.
08:49
Then...and we went to schools there, schools and college there.
08:57
Then...but always greenery and nice place, where we came
09:07
from.
09:07
I...I remember when I was eight years old...in India...no,
09:16
when I was three years
09:19
old, we got independence.
09:20
Indian independence.
09:23
After that, after five years, we got...what is that...elections.
09:31
Whole country, we had first elections were took place.
09:36
So I was only eight years old that time.
09:40
I was enjoying because all these parties are come there, slogans, and we used
09:47
to go, meet...see all that things.
09:50
The day they were electing, they brought the...all kinds of vehicles,
09:55
the buses....any kind of vehicle, they used to come home and took the
10:00
people with them to the voting booth.
10:03
And the...the first voting...we were just running around and
10:08
watching this...the people coming and taking them to the elections.
10:11
That was an interesting scene.
10:14
The first elections of India.
10:15
OK.
10:16
What year was that?
10:19
That was 1950.
10:19
I don’t know the month or date.
10:20
I know it was 1950.
10:21
Do--so do you remember...I guess you were way too young to remember independence.
10:21
I was eight-year-old.
10:21
Do you remember independence?
10:21
No.
10:21
Independence night...I don’t remember all that.
10:21
I was only five years.
10:21
We know...we know in high school, my high school, President Kennedy assassinated.
10:26
That time we got the holiday for our school.
10:30
Oh.
10:30
When President Kennedy was assassinated?
10:32
Yeah, that was in 1963, and yes.
10:35
Yeah.
10:35
‘64 or something ‘60.
10:39
‘62.
10:39
I was coming from Pune.
10:41
I was coming on the train when I was coming to Hyderabad.
10:48
That night, it happened, Nehru…when...
10:55
President Kennedy.
10:55
President Kennedy died.
10:56
And I kept my shoes under the bench, you know, where I was sitting.
11:03
The morning when I got up I lost the shoes.
11:06
There’s
11:09
no shoes.
11:09
And then somebody spoke…
11:09
I think that was 1962 when he died.
11:12
No...
11:12
I think ‘63.
11:13
‘63.
11:17
I was in high school
11:20
at that time.
11:20
And then I walked barefoot.
11:20
I went to my friend’s place.
11:25
And then wanted to buy shoes.
11:29
All the stores in the Hyderabad were closed.
11:34
Nothing is open.
11:35
Because of Kennedy’s assassination?
11:37
Yeah, because of Kennedy’s assassination.
11:39
I mean it was very…
11:41
India was so much…
11:44
Respected.
11:44
...fond of Kennedy I think.
11:47
I remember that time.
11:49
The whole school...we went home.
11:51
We were so happy because the school was closed.
11:55
No buses, no trains.
11:57
Nothing that whole day.
12:00
I have to travel some more, another two, three hundred miles.
12:05
I stuck in Hyderabad with a friend’s family.
12:09
I don’t have shoes, I have to borrow my friend’s sister’s shoes, because
12:14
that’s the only thing that fits me.
12:16
You know, but when we were growing up, we have floods a lot.
12:20
Every year we used to get floods.
12:22
Godavari.
12:23
In our home.
12:23
In Godavari, river is just like Willamette...bigger
12:27
than, larger than Willamette
12:31
River.
12:31
Willamette River, where we used to live.
12:33
So every year we used to have floods coming.
12:37
And then we used to go...and fishing.
12:40
And then some of the houses were…
12:46
Floating on the river.
12:47
Floating on the river because of the floods.
12:49
We used to go and collect some of the utensils.
12:53
It was
12:56
lot of fun, I mean, for us.
12:58
The children, we have fun.
12:59
And also rosewood and teak wood, because of the jungles washed away like that.
13:06
They used to come and…
13:06
Yeah, we used to come and collect all those things.
13:09
And also, when we were growing up, no electricity.
13:13
So we used to have that...kerosene lamps.
13:18
Yeah, we are using that one.
13:20
So by eight o’clock, by seven o’clock, we eat and then go to bed.
13:28
But then we get up early in the morning because no, no electricity, you know,
13:34
we used to read on these things...all streetlights we used to have.
13:38
We used to go and read books there sometimes.
13:42
So that’s the way we were...and also,
13:48
we always have the moonlight.
13:51
We used to...all the children...
13:54
Used to play…
13:54
...play...until nine o’clock.
13:55
I mean, until we go to bed, we used to play on the roads.
14:00
So we never had a fear or anything like that.
14:03
We can go anywhere whenever we want, whenever we come.
14:08
Then parents always...the girls should come home before six o’clock.
14:13
Yeah.
14:15
But in our area, we can play until eight, in front of our house.
14:19
So....and also in front of, behind and in front, we used to have canals.
14:27
So the people used to fish with hooks in front of our house.
14:32
Because that’s the flowing water at that time.
14:34
It’s not like a...it’s not like a stagnated water.
14:39
It always flows, the water.
14:41
So...and also, behind our house, it’s full of paddy...rice fields.
14:48
So we always get fresh air.
14:50
And you know, I don’t think we had any fans those days because
14:55
there was no electricity.
14:57
So...and also when we’re growing up, no radio either.
15:00
Yeah.
15:00
So later...then maybe when I was like a ten-year-old, one of my
15:10
uncle, distant uncle, he brought the radio from some country, he
15:17
went there and he brought it there.
15:19
So by three o’clock, we used to have
15:22
storytelling and then movies used to come in the radio.
15:27
So my parents used to tell us, “OK, finish all your work and then by three o’clock,
15:32
you can go. Otherwise you will not go.”
15:36
Yeah, so we used to...we had lot of fun, all of sitting together in front of radio.
15:41
Then we used to listen to the songs and stories and
15:52
things like that.
15:52
And also in our...when Indira Gandhi’s coming to villages in our area, then
15:57
we sat...we went morning eight o’clock until ten o’clock in the night, and
16:06
she couldn’t come, something happened, her helicopter or something like that.
16:10
So all...we all the people in the whole ground, we used to go and sit
16:15
waiting for Indira Gandhi to come.
16:16
She came around midnight.
16:16
Until that time, we were sitting there…
16:16
And no food!
16:16
All the stores are…
16:16
Emptied!
16:16
They sold everything they had.
16:16
Twenties.
16:16
Experienced that one, election.
16:16
Everybody
16:20
likes to go and vote in India.
16:22
From eighteen to all
16:43
the old women until she’s ninety years old.
16:48
Everyone goes and then they take bullock carts.
16:52
And some people go on by buses.
16:54
And some people carry
16:57
them and take them.
16:58
Everybody does.
17:00
That is the greatest in India.
17:07
Everybody likes to vote.
17:08
Elections.
17:09
We have so many parties.
17:10
Not two parties, maybe thirty....maybe ten, fifteen parties are there.
17:12
Everybody, they choose their own.
17:12
When we were there, that’s what, everybody likes to vote.
17:13
Especially the...you know, local mayors, then, what you call…
17:13
Panchayat raj.
17:16
Then who else?
17:17
Oh, Congressmen.
17:19
There lot of people, congresspeople, congressmen.
17:21
Congress, communists, socialists.
17:23
Prajaras.
17:24
See, in our own family, one of my cousins stood for the congressmen.
17:30
Yeah.
17:31
So everybody goes and vote...and telling people to vote for my cousin.
17:38
Did he win?
17:40
He won.
17:40
He won.
17:41
He won.
17:41
Oh.
17:44
So he went to the India parliament or the state?
17:47
State.
17:47
State, state.
17:48
Or city.
17:51
One of my friend,
17:54
very close friend of mine, he stood for elections.
18:02
He stood for
18:06
Panchet Raj.
18:07
That’s--panchet raj means--that’s a congressman here,
18:14
in city.
18:14
Panchet Raj.
18:15
Actually, he
18:19
was elected to be a ward...ward...you know, the wards are there.
18:25
Oh, like a city council?
18:27
Yeah, city council.
18:28
Like that, as soon as he was done, they made him the Panchat president!
18:36
Because the politics was such a way it happened, suddenly
18:40
they had to elect somebody.
18:41
City council, city council.
18:42
Even though he was not ready, he was the first time election.
18:45
They made him--
18:46
And he was young too!
18:47
He’s not that...I think he’s in thirties or twenties?
18:52
Twenties.
18:54
Twenties.
18:57
Interesting Indian
19:03
politics.
19:03
My question is kind of going back to
19:08
how your family was all Christian.
19:11
So my question was how was it like being Christians in a
19:14
majority Hindu-Muslim country?
19:22
In my village, missionaries came to my village.
19:24
Then my grandfather gave the land for the missionaries.
19:29
Then he became a Christian, his name was Golla James.
19:34
Then in our family, his only family, we are Christians than...that village.
19:41
Rest of them are not.
19:43
So my Grandfather James has five brothers and sisters.
19:49
One of his sisters is his [Sam’s] grandmother.
19:54
So we are--Sam and I--second cousins.
19:56
So then all of them...then we started the school there, in Lutheran high school.
20:06
Then...but most of them, majority of people, are our own...my grandfather’s
20:15
cousins, siblings, and all those things.
20:17
So we never come across with any Hindu people.
20:25
So majority of us, whole...my town, my village, is only Christians.
20:30
That’s why we don’t have any other...this thing.
20:34
For me, I grew up...you know, I’m Christian.
20:41
But we have more contact with all the other people.
20:46
The Hindu families, they come and go.
20:49
Doesn’t matter whether...what...what...any caste or anything...or anything.
20:57
They all, whether it is Brahmin, Kamas, or Rajas...
21:02
We don’t know the difference.
21:04
We don’t have any difference.
21:04
They all come to our house.
21:06
They eat with us, we go to their home, their weddings, and their many functions.
21:11
They come to our places.
21:14
Even Muslims.
21:17
We used to go to their Ramzan
21:21
things.
21:21
And they come to our homes and we all...because...especially because
21:26
my family, my parents, they all travel different parts in Andhra.
21:32
We
21:34
lived in Nellore, we lived in Ongole, we...Vijaywada.
21:35
Visakapatnam...
21:35
Hyderabad.
21:35
Hyderabad.
21:35
Nellore.
21:35
All
21:43
these places.
21:44
Because his father was transferring.
21:46
My father was travelling to different places and different
21:50
kinds of people come to our house.
21:51
So we don’t have any...any, “Oh, you’re a Hindu, or you’re a Muslim…”
21:56
We don’t have any of those things.
21:58
We used to go and we all are the same.
22:04
The choice of choosing God, of religion is a personal.
22:08
But there, we always meet with everybody.
22:16
Even Hindu festivals, we used to go.
22:20
And Christmas, they used to come.
22:23
But we don’t celebrate Christmases like a big deal or any other one.
22:29
Diwali, everybody will celebrate, because that’s the festival of lights.
22:33
So then, that’s the reason we don’t...we never felt...tension or
22:44
stressed out for religion things or caste things like that.
22:47
Because we went to same schools.
22:48
You know,
22:52
if you go...but in our school, all, whole communities…
22:57
All communities come.
22:58
All communities come to same school.
23:00
Christian school, many communities come.
23:03
Because mostly Christian school, all
23:05
Hindus come to Christian school.
23:07
I have a couple of interesting experiences I have.
23:13
When we are growing up in high school,
23:28
we
23:31
know one girl, a
23:34
Brahmin girl, come to school and all that.
23:38
We used to speak to her and all that.
23:41
When we went to Pune, I went to Pune, she was married by then, and she
23:47
was...with her husband she came to Pune.
23:51
There we met her in a bus and we became very close friends.
23:56
And she used to come to our school...you know, boarding school, I mean hostels.
24:03
She used to come with her children, she’ll carry and come
24:07
when her husband went to work.
24:09
She used to spend with us all the time.
24:12
We used to go to their home and eat with her family and
24:18
her husband is so beautiful.
24:21
People who are educated, they don’t have any problem.
24:24
The people who are uneducated, they are the one...caste system.
24:29
Otherwise...because we have education, we only associated with educated people.
24:38
Right?
24:39
No--
24:39
So that’s why we don’t have any differences those days.
24:46
But nobody ever pinpointed us so that’s why we never experienced.
24:48
So we don’t have any other misunderstandings or anything like that.
24:48
But the present, we don’t know, because we came here thirty-six years ago.
24:48
But when we were growing up, when we were studying, when we were working,
24:49
we didn’t have any other this thing.
24:50
All our friends...no difference ,we never felt anything.
24:51
Religion is religion, personal,
24:56
nothing to do with our relations.
24:57
It’s the same thing.
24:57
If I...my religion I can’t impose on you.
25:03
That’s a problem.
25:04
But whatever you choose, that’s it.
25:06
I can’t force on my kids, but when they’re growing up, I just plant
25:13
them, this is the way I do things.
25:15
But when you’re growing up, you have your intelligence, and you know...you
25:20
want to...close to God, you worship.
25:23
If you don’t have...but I...even if I want you to do it...but you won’t
25:29
do it because until you choose to do
25:35
it.
25:35
That’s what.
25:35
But many people think...oh, the Christians are coming to...this
25:41
thing...they’re converting people, but conversion is not someone tells.
25:49
Unless you research, you read,
25:53
you know what you are doing.
25:55
This is
25:58
personal.
25:58
Long time ago, Rama and Krishna, they were kings, but still
26:01
people are worshipping him.
26:04
But that’s their choice.
26:06
That’s the way we think.
26:08
Religion is individual.
26:09
That’s the way we’re brought up.
26:10
You want to go to salvation.
26:17
Everybody wants to go to heaven, right?
26:20
That’s only motive.
26:22
Religion is that.
26:25
That’s what we feel like that.
26:29
OK.
26:29
Thank you.
26:34
So now I kind of wanted to talk about the United States.
26:39
So my question is when did you move to the United States and what brought you here?
26:43
We came in 19--
26:44
We came in 1980, in December.
26:44
Before that, I applied a job.
26:44
Before that I was working in a school, residential school.
26:44
I was a dean of girls, there.
26:44
Then I also went to school as a nurse, RN.
26:44
So then when I applied a job, here...The reason I applied a job...lot of
26:44
my friends, Sam’s friends are in…
26:44
United States.
26:52
States.
27:25
They always comes...it will be nice, you come there.
27:29
So, then...but then...
27:31
Nen chepthundi.
27:34
[I will tell.]
27:34
Then...we tried many times, but...one of my...through friend, then I applied a job.
27:45
Then I got a job here, that’s why with my kids, with my older daughter is
27:52
one-and-a-half, then my younger one is six months old, then we came to United States.
27:58
Then when we came here, then I started working in a nursing home.
28:02
And then...it was not...nursing home working...it was very hard for me.
28:10
With small children.
28:12
But the survival...I have to work hard.
28:19
Then he got a job in Hewlett-Packard.
28:22
Then after three years, then I got a job in
28:28
Hewlett-Packard.
28:28
In the beginning, we didn’t like it...the hard work, you
28:32
know, and everything is strange.
28:35
We don’t see that many Indians that time.
28:38
So we...kind of hard.
28:41
But then later on...
28:42
We had a hard
28:45
time.
28:45
And also we are fortunate because our church is
28:49
here.
28:49
And then we used to go to church and we associated with all the members.
28:54
And then we got used to it.
29:00
A problem when we first came...we faced...is to raise children.
29:06
Because they were very small.
29:10
Both of us working.
29:11
Unless we both work, we can’t survive properly.
29:15
So we had hard time...
29:16
I used to work nights and he used to work daytime.
29:19
So that we can take care of the kids.
29:24
Oh, OK.
29:24
We never wanted to put them with babysitter.
29:29
Babysitter, we don’t know them, how they will...
29:31
How they are going to treat our children.
29:33
So we were scared.
29:35
So Auntie used to work in the night.
29:42
Ten or...ten to...ten to morning.
29:45
11 to 7.
29:48
11 to 7.
29:49
And he used to work 7 to 3.
29:49
I started working when I was working, morning 7 to 3 o’clock.
29:53
I come after 3
29:57
o’clock and auntie will go to…
30:00
Work.
30:00
...bed or do something.
30:03
As soon as he comes home, I go to bed, because I have to sleep
30:07
to...in order to go to work.
30:10
So…
30:11
That was a hard time.
30:12
Until the kids
30:15
were twelve year old, I was working nights to take care of them.
30:20
But once they are twelve, then they know, bus comes, to go there.
30:24
But we had a good community.
30:28
Community really helped us.
30:31
Even preschool and kindergarten...and then Corvallis friends, I mean those who are in
30:38
school, the community, they really helped us...to take them to school sometimes.
30:48
We used to have lot of snow, those days.
30:50
So you could come, go, and pick them up, then they used to bring them home.
30:57
The community really helped us here.
30:59
And not only that.
31:02
We have friends who were in Washington D.C. They helped
31:09
us...first phone was given to
31:13
put it in our house.
31:15
A friend of mine, childhood friend...he sent money to install my own phone.
31:24
And then my childhood friend, high school friend who sent money to buy a car.
31:31
Those are the things that helped even when we first came to America.
31:33
You know, but we felt so much homesick, because we haven’t
31:38
seen Indians almost one year.
31:40
Yeah, in Corvallis.
31:42
But you know, the fortunate...because we have no language problem.
31:48
But otherwise...because we never used to have...no rice here those days.
31:55
No spices.
31:57
And then for food we really struggled.
32:01
You know?
32:02
I mean everything we don’t eat...even the cheese...someone gave us a Christmas gift.
32:07
We are not used to eat cheese, this thing.
32:11
We kept it almost two, three months, then I threw it off.
32:16
So like that, food was very hard for us in those days.
32:22
Especially we are vegetarians.
32:24
So we kind of...hard to find food.
32:27
We can’t go to restaurants.
32:29
And when you go to restaurants, they only give potatoes, but not vegetables.
32:33
Except salad, you know.
32:36
Salad also....
32:37
We had very hard time.
32:38
So we used to go to Canada, British Columbia, or Bay Area, San Francisco.
32:45
Every six months we used to drive and bring all the spices and
32:52
rice and dal and everything.
32:53
You had to go all the way to Canada?
32:54
Not even Seattle?
32:55
Not even Seattle.
32:56
Not even Seattle.
32:56
We don’t know Seattle that time.
33:00
Canada means you get everything.
33:02
So six months groceries we used to get.
33:06
We used to go in the seven hours drive to there.
33:10
Then we have friends there, so we used to spend night over there, then the evening
33:16
we used to...next day we used to come.
33:18
Just like we’d go on Friday then we come.
33:20
Whenever we have three-day weekend, week, then we used to
33:24
drive and go and bring that.
33:26
Same thing in Bay Area.
33:29
We struggled, we struggled when we first came.
33:33
But then we worked...we worked hard.
33:36
Never...
33:37
First five years, we were homesick.
33:38
Yeah.
33:41
So then we went home.
33:45
First we think, why we have to stay here, we have jobs there,
33:49
we have our own home there.
33:52
All our relatives are there.
33:53
Why in the world we have to stay here?
33:57
We didn’t come for the food, or job anything because we
34:00
already have jobs there.
34:02
And also, I never put a diaper for my kids there.
34:07
Because I always have some maid come and do that.
34:11
So things like that...and parents are close by.
34:14
They always cook food and send to us.
34:17
So that’s the reason when we first came here, we have from scratch,
34:22
we have to cook, clean, take care of the babies, go to work.
34:25
I never dreamt about working so hard in America.
34:25
We never thought when we were in
34:35
India.
34:36
So then after three months I used to torture...I mean I used to force,
34:40
let’s go home, let’s go home, why in the world we stay here, like that.
34:46
Then he always says, God has a plan.
34:49
Maybe that’s why we are here.
34:52
And you wait for one year, two years, then we’ll go home.
34:56
Then after one to two years, then we got friends and then we got used to it.
35:01
And kids started school.
35:03
Then we accustomed with this culture.
35:05
And not only that.
35:07
First...after five years we stayed, we worked hard, we saved
35:15
some money, after five years.
35:20
On fifth year I had a gall bladder...in the hospital.
35:24
As soon as
35:27
the surgery was over, that’s the time we planned to go to India.
35:31
We saved some money, bought tickets.
35:33
First when we came to America, we came with two tickets.
35:34
Children came free those days.
35:34
Then after we came here, five years, we stayed, we went to India with
35:37
little bit of savings that we had.
35:38
Yeah, we stayed two months there.
35:39
We stayed two months.
35:39
And we came back, then we went to Canada the same year
35:51
and we came back.
35:52
After a year, we bought our first house.
35:56
That was...in six, seven years?
36:00
No...in five years.
36:04
‘95 we bought that one.
36:06
‘96.
36:07
‘86.
36:08
I mean ‘86.
36:08
‘86 we bought the first house.
36:08
‘85, yeah.
36:12
Every time we went to India, came back, we went to Canada, drove and
36:36
came
36:53
back.
36:53
Then we bought the first house.
36:54
My friend’s—my
37:25
friend’s graduation in Canada.
37:25
So my next question is did you ever face prejudice from Americans
37:29
based on the fact that you were Indian or that you were immigrants?
37:33
No.
37:34
No.
37:34
No, we had lot of wonderful friends.
37:36
Friends, and—
37:37
Here, I have made friends
37:41
with all...Americans.
37:42
We are fortunate to come to Corvallis.
37:46
We don’t have—those prejudice or facing
37:50
some problems, like that, we didn’t have.
37:53
We weren’t different culture of people...we blend
37:56
with all the people here.
37:56
We never had any problem.
38:01
We have lot of good friends.
38:06
They treat us good.
38:06
And we treat them good.
38:06
We have blacks, and we have whites and we have...all different...
38:09
They always come to our home.
38:11
Our door is open.
38:13
Anybody can come and eat and a lot of people...they always
38:16
like to come to our home.
38:19
Because—especially church members—and we are involved in the community.
38:26
When our kids were small, we used to work for...what you call...you
38:34
know, elderly people, giving food?
38:36
What you call those things?
38:38
Loving, like a care?
38:39
You know, we used to go door to door, we used to supply
38:43
food for the people like that.
38:44
So many of us, they know us and we know most of them.
38:49
So...but...kids...schoolteachers and
38:56
community, everybody.
38:59
We didn’t have any problem with anyone.
39:01
Not anyone.
39:01
OK.
39:01
Some people that I interviewed previously specifically talked about 9/11.
39:03
So did that impact you in any way?
39:04
No.
39:06
No.
39:06
Is there anything more you want to talk about, specifically the experience
39:09
of moving to the United States?
39:12
Either challenges or anything else?
39:15
Oh.
39:16
Well, see, that’s what I told you in the beginning, we didn’t like it, because of
39:24
hard work.
39:29
Then...before I started working, I wanted to go to school here, but
39:34
because of children are very small, then I didn’t get to go to school.
39:39
I had to work to survive.
39:41
So that’s the reason...but...before I came, I thought, “oh, I can do lot
39:48
of things in America.” That’s what I thought, that’s why I came here.
39:52
After experiencing.
39:53
School
39:59
and then again survive.
40:02
So that’s the reason—
40:04
We are happy.
40:04
But whatever education we had in India, with that, we
40:09
got a job in Hewlett-Packard.
40:11
Before
40:14
that, I worked in Good Sam for three years.
40:18
And then before that, I worked in a nursing home.
40:22
That’s the hardest part for me, working there for three years in
40:28
nursing home as a nurse’s aide.
40:32
Then after I moved to Good Sam, then I felt a little bit better.
40:39
Then moved to HP, then we had a very comfortable...we
40:43
are able to educate our kids.
40:48
They both went to a private school when they are up to ninth grade.
40:52
So then...we were able to educate them here because of HP.
40:59
They both went to high school in Corvallis and Oregon State.
41:05
Both went to engineering, Oregon State University.
41:10
Now they finished their Master’s, they’re working and they became good
41:16
citizens, and we are very happy.
41:18
Soyou
41:26
talked a little bit about the general community of Corvallis,
41:28
so I was wondering what the Indian community was specifically like at
41:32
the time you moved here and how has
41:35
that changed.
41:35
When we first came, one year, we didn’t meet any Indians, because very
41:40
few people are there.. Then Oregon State University, some students came.
41:47
Then we went to that...Indian…
41:53
India Night.
41:53
India Night.
41:54
We met them there.
41:56
Then there are three, four families.
41:59
I mean, not families, single students.
42:03
So after that, we were so happy, because they’re coming to our home, we go there,
42:08
and when our kids are small, they used to come and babysit our kids, like that.
42:14
Then your dad and mom came later.
42:17
Then we are more close families, two, three families that time.
42:25
But now, most of the Indians...we know everybody.
42:32
We always get together.
42:35
And then we call them
42:40
for dinner or lunch or potlucks or something like that.
42:42
Any birthdays, graduation parties, all those things we always attend that one.
42:48
So we have very good relations with every Indian who lives in
42:56
Corvallis.
42:56
The students who graduated from Oregon State, we have connections
43:02
everywhere in United States.
43:04
Everywhere.
43:06
We go there, they come and visit us, and this is like their home.
43:12
So majority of Oregon State University students who attended...who know them,
43:18
so they always come and stay with us.
43:20
Especially in eighties, the students who came from India...and
43:28
they were...
43:30
We used to help them.
43:30
Culturally, they were different.
43:33
Sometimes the language speaking and all that.
43:36
We used to encourage them, if they need any help, go for shopping.
43:41
Yeah, we used to take them.
43:43
To find a room, or something or other.
43:46
We used to go.
43:47
And we used to give furniture for them.
43:48
They used to call us.
43:52
I don’t know how they came to know our phone number.
43:55
They always called us and we used to go to Portland and pick them up.
44:00
Portland…after a while...
44:02
And they come and stay in our home until they find a room.
44:05
And some of the students who got graduated but they didn’t get jobs,
44:10
they came and stayed in our home.
44:10
Then after that, when they get the job,
44:15
they went there.
44:16
So we’re kind of like
44:20
godfathers, things like that.
44:21
They used to come,
44:26
we used to help people.
44:28
Community help.
44:29
That’s really nice.
44:33
So how has Corvallis changed as a whole from when you first moved here to now?
44:40
Well, there’s a lot of population now.
44:44
There are lot of buildings on the ninth street.
44:48
There were no shops, nothing’s like a...small, small trees used to be there.
44:54
Now all shopping center scale.
44:56
And then...Corvallis increased a lot.
45:00
In HP, to go to work, we never used to have that much
45:06
traffic.
45:06
Traffic here...you can see traffic here.
45:10
Even to go from Corvallis to Portland, so much traffic.
45:15
Population is really increased.
45:16
When I first came, the Walnut Street, they planned it,
45:24
to make that road.
45:27
And they connected to the new HP.
45:29
Circle.
45:32
20.
45:33
And there used to be some motels on 9th Street.
45:38
They are all demolished.
45:42
New shops have come up.
45:46
Railway station used to be from this side of downtown, they put it outside.
45:53
And university, there lot of new buildings.
45:56
Yeah, new buildings came.
45:57
And also in Fred Meyer, Waremart used to be there.
46:02
Opposite to Fred Meyer, Waremart
46:07
used to be there.
46:07
Food store.
46:07
Food store, that’s only store.
46:09
Then after that, Winco, and then Walmart, KMart,
46:16
Home Depot...what
46:20
is that...this new one?
46:22
Safeway…
46:22
Market of Choice?
46:23
Yes, Market of Choice.
46:24
Payless.
46:24
And there’s this Natural...this thing All these stores came later.
46:30
Only we used to have Bi-Mart and Rite-Aid.
46:34
And then we used to have Richie’s Market.
46:37
That’s the only three we used to have.
46:39
And Safeway is downtown.
46:41
But now three more Safeways came and two Bi-Marts now.
46:48
Near Philomath.
46:49
Development on the…
46:51
And the Wilson’s Park, all Indian community helped
46:55
to build the Wilson School
47:00
Park.
47:00
The Wildcat Park?
47:01
Not all,
47:04
you know, few.
47:04
Majority, Shankar, Bhaskar, everybody, they did that one.
47:07
Then, that...one more park...Walnut Park?
47:13
I don’t whether that one is there or not.
47:17
Yeah, there are lot of...new developments after we came.
47:19
And new buildings.
47:21
Timberhill, those apartments, you never had in front of your home.
47:27
Those things, never had.
47:29
Then even CH2M Hill built after we came.
47:37
I look at the Good Sam area, those are wild trees and
47:42
everything, now the houses came.
47:45
So much development.
47:46
Lot of development.
47:46
Lot of people.
47:46
They expanded the Corvallis.
47:46
Especially in southern part.
47:46
All the way...Willamette...southern part of Willamette River.
47:46
There also, some houses came.
47:46
And even Lewisberg is developed.
47:47
What else?
47:47
Yeah,
47:59
the next question is just
48:12
how has America as a whole changed from how it was when you arrived?
48:17
Well...there are...I mean...airlines changed a lot because...before, we
48:30
used to go freely and pick them up.
48:32
After 9/11...now, you don’t have that much intimacy of people.
48:43
Everybody is typing on the text message.
48:46
No postal, no letters.
48:51
Before we used to send greeting cards.
48:53
Now they’re sending on iPhone
48:57
or iPad.
48:57
They’re not calling anymore.
48:59
They’re always “how are you” text message.
49:02
That individual...that love connection is gone.
49:09
Everybody is busy with their own lives.
49:12
Churchgoing is reduced.
49:12
Before, everybody used to go to church.
49:18
Lot of their children and all they’re not coming to church anymore.
49:24
That is a sad part.
49:25
So...then...the community itself is changed a lot.
49:35
There is no intimacy, there is no love.
49:40
People want to do themself.
49:43
They want to do their own.
49:45
Before we used to go and visit people, things like that.
49:48
Now we have to call.
49:50
That time no cell phones those days.
49:52
Only land phone.
49:53
Even land phone was very expensive.
49:56
So usually, people used to go or come, we travel a lot to help each other.
50:05
So that’s...the communication is changed.
50:09
The love affection is changed.
50:12
Even the airlines and...you know, things like that changed a lot.
50:21
I kind of wanted to ask Sammy Uncle the same question so I’ll hold off a bit.
50:21
The next question is what change or impact do you think you had
50:25
on Corvallis either in terms of your work or community service?
50:29
What kind of impact do you think you had on the town?
50:34
We do help.
50:36
Before I used to...even on and off, we do hospitality.
50:43
If anyone is sick, we go and provide food and then we go and take them to school or
50:52
hospital or buy things for elderly people.
50:57
Children...I used to go to children to give hot lunches.
51:01
We go every once a week.
51:07
And church especially.
51:10
Cleaning schools, we used to go and clean up and do things like that.
51:18
Then that way, we can help the community.
51:26
Providing homeless people with food.
51:29
We also give shelter to the people who are moving away and then they needed
51:35
help, then we give home and shelter.
51:44
Next thing is...what moments in
51:52
your time...what specific historical events, world or
51:59
American events that happened do you think had an impact on you?
52:05
Not really...I don’t know.
52:09
What...well, 9/11 of course.
52:12
Definitely.
52:13
It was very eye-opening.
52:17
And then also...you know, the wars happened.
52:27
In Iran and Iraq at that time.
52:29
How many of our soldiers gave their life.
52:32
That made me sad because lot of children there under 25...lot of
52:41
them...and then there was 9/11 of course, we lost so many people.
52:49
Things like that.
52:51
That definitely make us sad.
52:53
What the world is going on.
52:56
So we believe that God has...still saved good blessings for America.
53:11
One person is good, God will bless rest of them.
53:17
That’s what I believe in.
53:19
Next,
53:23
I kind of wanted to ask about your children.
53:28
How was it for your children to grow up here?
53:34
For example, they kind of had two identities, being Indian-American
53:36
.How was it growing up Indian-American because of those two cultural identities?
53:41
Actually, my
53:48
kids, both of them, they went to private school.
53:53
That’s a Christian school.
53:55
So they never had any other
54:01
relation with any other children because all Christian children only came.
54:09
Then after that they went to Crescent Valley School.
54:12
So they were witness to many people there.
54:16
So they never had any problem with anybody.
54:19
So they went
54:23
there for good education and then college
54:29
they went to OSU.
54:30
Nothing impacted anything.
54:32
They want them to study hard and good grades and they finished
54:37
their college and went off.
54:40
They’re both got Master’s degrees.
54:44
And one is working for CISCO, other one is working for Johnson and Johnson.
54:53
I kind of want to go back to the other questions.
54:56
I have
54:59
one more question.
55:06
Actually, I have two more questions.
55:10
How do you think you were changed by Corvallis?
55:22
Actually...I don’t think I have
55:32
changed except wearing pants and shirts!
55:34
Not really.
55:36
Nothing much changed.
55:38
Because there also I was working, here also I am working.
55:42
Only thing I worked here harder than there.
55:46
But in the beginning, I had little bit of hard time adjusting here.
55:51
Once you are used to it, you go...I know we have to
55:58
get
56:01
children...to give a
56:05
good education, comfort for my kids.
56:09
That’s only thinking I was thinking here..but then otherwise, I didn’t
56:16
change comparing there and here.
56:21
Did we change anything?
56:22
I don’t think so.
56:24
Because we are...all the time we are working, working.
56:26
We only know how to work.
56:28
And taking care of the kids, taking care of...buy the house.
56:34
Make ourselves comfortable.
56:35
That’s it.
56:36
It depends on ourselves how we are comfortable or not.
56:43
When we are busy and you are getting everything, then it’s
56:47
OK...I didn’t see any difference.
56:51
Only thing, we were young there.
56:54
Here...when you are young, you don’t think anything.
56:59
So you matured, kind of?
57:01
JK.
57:01
Yeah, right.
57:02
We are here more mature than there.
57:05
We lived more here than there.
57:07
We lived more years here than
57:12
there.
57:12
We are more Americanized than Indians.
57:19
Half of our life is here.
57:21
There we are young.
57:24
You know, we wanted to achieve.
57:27
That’s one of the reasons we are here.
57:36
Now we achieved...quite…
57:36
We are retired now.
57:38
We don’t have any aspiration to do something more.
57:41
We are just passing by.
57:41
So my last question for you is do
57:44
you want to share either the best memories you had in Corvallis?
57:44
Either the best memory or the best memories.
57:53
The best memories are...everything is best.
58:05
Best memories...from our church.
58:08
We always go for hikes and then we have good potlucks.
58:15
And then our children...in university, all
58:22
India Nights we used to go.
58:24
India Nights.
58:26
And then we participate, we help them.
58:28
And especially in the beginning, 1980s, we used to go and help OSU
58:33
students to cook, clean, and all those things we used to do for them.
58:41
The best memories...my HP picnics.
58:44
We used to enjoy a lot
58:50
with all our coworkers.
58:51
All those things, that’s HP picnics with children and all, we used to enjoy a lot.
58:56
That’s the best memories for HP.
58:58
We are fortunate HP is in Corvallis.
59:01
That’s my best memories.
59:02
If you want to go, that’s OK.
59:04
I’ll ask the remainder questions.
59:04
My question is how has America as a whole changed from when you arrived
59:07
to the country to how it is now?
59:25
What are you talking about—politically?
59:27
Anything.
59:33
Overall.
59:34
Overall?
59:38
The only...the last thirty years.
59:42
We never...in the beginning, when we came,
59:48
we never had...very, very calm and quiet.
59:51
But slowly the gun shootings...you know, there’s innocent children
1:00:01
who are shot for nothing.
1:00:04
The life...life is...the country
1:00:17
has created fear in everyone.
1:00:20
Your children goes to school, we used to be very comfortable when
1:00:24
they go to school and come back.
1:00:25
Now we are not able to be that safe until they come back home.
1:00:33
This gun control problem
1:00:38
is...I mean, they are not able to do anything.
1:00:41
It’s true some people think...in this
1:00:51
modern world,
1:00:55
why do we need gun?
1:00:55
We don’t need gun.
1:00:55
In the modern world, we don’t need...we don’t want to fight with other people.
1:00:58
What’s the necessity to fight with other people?
1:01:02
In the olden days, we used to live in jungles, less people...some wild
1:01:09
animals come, we need protection.
1:01:11
But now,
1:01:14
we are educated people.
1:01:15
And there is a part of reasoning...that...why
1:01:23
we need to carry guns?
1:01:25
I didn’t understand.
1:01:27
This gun control should be there in this country.
1:01:34
I feel until that is not...this...shootings of children and
1:01:43
other things taking place more and more now in America than when I first came.
1:01:52
That was the biggest problem.
1:01:54
It’s like a cancer.
1:01:55
We are not in a Middle Eastern country
1:02:06
where they always fight...for survival.
1:02:06
Here, what survival do we need for guns.
1:02:07
We don’t need guns for survival.
1:02:10
It’s a peaceful country and a wonderful country.
1:02:16
For everything there’s a law, and if you follow the law, you’ll be peaceful,
1:02:21
happy person, but if you don’t follow the law, you’ll get into some trouble.
1:02:28
Because guns are so prevalent in this country, nobody’s safe.
1:02:36
Guns make them to kill and
1:02:41
just get angry.
1:02:42
In order to kill.
1:02:42
That’s the thing, I don’t like...that
1:02:46
is going to...happening more and more.
1:02:50
And not only that, one more thing I want to add—because lot of
1:02:55
single parents, children don’t have both parents’ guidance.
1:03:04
Mother always goes with work...one parent goes to work, then kids,
1:03:10
no one there to guide them.
1:03:15
But they always talk about teachers has to discipline them.
1:03:19
You cannot control one child at home, how do you expect teacher
1:03:25
will control that many children?
1:03:28
So actually, first five years, first ten years, parents’ guidance are number one.
1:03:36
Then teachers are second.
1:03:39
Their second parents.
1:03:42
They only can help but you cannot...you don’t expect them to do everything.
1:03:49
So that’s why children are not getting education, first thing.
1:03:55
Then the parents don’t have time to raise them.
1:03:59
That’s why we did...our kids, we worked one night and the other day
1:04:06
time, that’s how we take care of kids.
1:04:08
That’s why our children never gave us any problem.
1:04:11
Because every movement, we see them...what they’re doing.
1:04:16
And we always encourage other kids come to our home so that we know what kind
1:04:22
of friends our children are associated.
1:04:24
So that is the thing.
1:04:25
Community has to open their eyes and see that you cannot expect a child
1:04:32
to grow without parents’ guidance.
1:04:34
That’s why they have so many problems.
1:04:42
So...that’s the thing we have seen since we came here.
1:04:48
OK.
1:04:50
So I only have two more questions.
1:04:54
Or actually three more questions—so what change—no, actually two more questions.
1:05:00
What change or impact do you think you had in terms of your work or
1:05:05
Corvallis that you contributed to the town or to your work?
1:05:14
Anything you’re particularly proud of accomplishing or doing?
1:05:22
That’s
1:05:25
really
1:05:35
hard to...helping individually.
1:05:37
But...there’s nothing that extraordinary to tell.
1:05:42
What do
1:05:48
you think are the best memories you’ve had in Corvallis?
1:05:53
Corvallis is a beautiful place.
1:05:54
Very, very calm, quiet.
1:05:57
The
1:05:59
people are all loving people.
1:06:03
I don’t think anything against...people are very, very
1:06:10
nice people, try to help each other.
1:06:13
They want to be a community.
1:06:17
Work together.
1:06:18
I think that’s the main thing about this town.
1:06:23
It’s a very cozy, small...all...we know lot of people.
1:06:30
Not many people, but as much as we come across.
1:06:37
It’s very nice.
1:06:39
No...patriotism or
1:06:46
fighting or theft
1:06:51
or vandalizing.
1:06:53
All those things are not in this town, as far as I know.
1:06:57
I’ve never come across.
1:06:58
It’s a peace-loving city.
1:07:01
And people are good, help when they ask for help.
1:07:08
That’s all.
1:07:09
That is Corvallis.
