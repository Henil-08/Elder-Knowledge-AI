This is an interview by Elise Hargreaves for the Horner Museum.
00:00
On Tuesday, February 26, 1986 I interviewed Dr. Chih Wang, professor
00:00
of nuclear engineering at OSU.
00:01
Where were you born?
00:01
Were you born in this country?
00:03
I was born in Shanghai, which is the seaport in the middle
00:07
of the channel in the Jiangsu
00:15
province.
00:15
Shanghai now is a municipal.
00:19
It's the city of Shanghai.
00:22
It's still called Shanghai, right?
00:24
It's called Shanghai.
00:26
The name hasn't been changed.
00:30
Okay.
00:32
What year were you born?
00:34
I was born in 1917.
00:36
Okay.
00:38
So you were born in Shanghai with your family.
00:41
What was it like back then?
00:43
Well, of course, I don't remember too much of my younger days.
00:48
My father he was working for the railroad as an accountant and my
00:58
mother, beloved mother, died probably something like 2 weeks
01:04
after birth due to infection.
01:07
So I was brought up by a nanny
01:14
and a nursemaid until 4 years old and then my father married again to my stepmother.
01:24
She was the one that brought me up.
01:31
So the only thing I can remember is we lived in a place very close to a
01:37
railroad station because my father's office is close to, it's in a station.
01:45
It's kind of a small place but it's no longer there.
01:49
I went back there in '72
01:52
to look for the place and it's already burned down by the Japanese
01:56
during the Sino-Japanese war.
02:01
Not much I can tell you at that time.
02:03
Do you remember what the city was like back then when you were younger?
02:08
Well, I don't remember so much of the... the only thing I know is that
02:17
because I moved when I was 7 years old, moved to a place called Qingdao,
02:22
it's another seaport up north.
02:26
That was a time when Japanese agreed to return...they
02:32
controlled the city of Qingdao.
02:37
It used to be spelled T-s-i-n-g-t-a-o, and the new spelling now is Q-i-n-g-d-a-o.
02:48
It literally means "green island."
02:52
It's a pretty place.
02:54
When I was 7 years old my father was a member of a team.
03:00
They took over the administration of the railroad from Qingdao
03:08
to Henan, about 500 kilometers.
03:14
So I was there ever since then until I was 21 years old.
03:20
During that time I went to a primary school.
03:25
I was a Boy Scout at one time as I recall.
03:29
I was kind of naughty boy, pretty hard to manage.
03:34
My stepmother took care of me very well and so I was kind
03:40
of spoiled in those days.
03:44
And during the period between I was
03:50
7 years old all the way up to
03:55
20 years old [I graduated from the university at 20 years old],
04:01
I went to a primary school close by to home.
04:06
I remember the home which is still there is the two places that they
04:12
used to be occupied by Germans, and then after the First World War
04:22
was taken over by Japanese and during the '20s return to China, so it has
04:32
a lot of flavor of a European town mixed up with some Japanese flavor.
04:39
So I went to high school there for 6 years.
04:44
I was not a very good student,
04:49
almost flunked out during the second year of my junior high school.
04:56
But I managed to graduate and went to a University of Shandong, which is
05:02
a national university right in town.
05:08
For some reason I did very well.
05:11
I even got a scholarship for the junior and the senior year.
05:21
During that period I recall we left
05:28
Shandong twice, due to crisis.
05:30
Because when the Japanese, especially with China with the invasion and
05:37
the war, you know the Manchuria incident and so on down the line.
05:44
Eventually
05:47
in
05:51
1937 we were forced to evacuate.
05:54
So I took my mother, my half-sister, two of them, and my half-brother
06:02
all the way, using the railroad system, all the way moved west.
06:10
And then turned down south and then eventually get to the town
06:19
which is my step mother's hometown.
06:24
And I went back all by myself to Qingdao again, because at that
06:30
time I was appointed as a teaching assistant, so I had a job, so to speak.
06:38
Before too long I
06:46
couldn't stay there too much because we were just packing ready to move on.
06:50
One day I recall it was in August
06:55
1937 Japanese fleet came into the harbor with [unintellible] , so I followed my
07:03
father's instruction to went to see a
07:08
man in the custom house was his friend.
07:13
I arranged for me to get on board a British ship flying a British flag
07:22
and left that day for Shanghai.
07:27
That was what
07:30
happened during for
07:33
the first 20 years of my life.
07:37
Okay.
07:38
That's interesting.
07:41
Okay, where did you go once you'd left from there?
07:45
How did you get over here?
07:46
That's a very long story.
07:47
[Laughs]
07:49
. I was in Shanghai for
07:53
almost, just about over a month.
07:57
Shanghai at that time was surrounded by Japanese, but
08:00
at Shanghai I was staying with
08:06
my aunt who later on turned out to be my mother-in-law,
08:12
because I married her daughter.
08:19
I was staying in their place, very crowded.
08:22
It's a 3-story apartment-type, also called a flat, three flats.
08:29
But there was a lot of people there and
08:33
not much to do waiting for the situation to improve.
08:39
Before too long it looks like a pretty bad situation, I think it
08:48
was sometime in August, actually, Japanese decide to invade Shanghai
08:57
and from Shanghai go into inland, started a so-called military invasion.
09:02
At that time, just a few days before that there was another critical date.
09:10
I got a word from my father, who worked to the southwest of Shanghai
09:17
who was then promoted to be the highest person of the railroad.
09:24
In those days railroads were owned by the state.
09:30
He told somebody to bring word to me that we have a convoy truck leaving
09:36
Shanghai for his place, for headquarter, would be last evacuation possible.
09:45
So he asked me to decide if I want to take a chance to get out or stay behind.
09:56
I thought about it for quite a while, decided that it's
09:59
no place for me to stay here.
10:00
Before too long we'd be all surrounded by Japanese, even I will be safe
10:07
for that time in the so-called international settlement and French
10:12
Concession, there's two conquests.
10:16
Japanese would not come in at that time because that was before second war.
10:22
When I was there, there was no hope, nothing I could do to find
10:25
a job, to do something useful.
10:29
So that's why I decided to go along with the plan.
10:35
I contacted a truck driver in a convoy of really 6 or 8 trucks
10:43
and he told me we're going to move out the next morning at 2:00 because we
10:53
want to get out from Shanghai as far as possible, otherwise we'll be waiting,
10:58
we will be bombed by Japanese airplane.
11:02
So we did
11:06
leave the depot
11:10
on time
11:12
but by that time the whole city of Shanghai was, the settlement and the
11:18
French Concession, was surrounded by fire.
11:21
They had started a fire all the way just like a ring of fire.
11:28
We had to break through it like a blockade.
11:33
In doing so we did get out, but it slowed us down quite a bit so we didn't get too
11:39
far, maybe about, not even 100 km, which is about 60 miles, when the town broke.
11:49
Right after that of course, bombers started coming and
11:53
we were bombed 3 foot high.
11:57
I was sitting on top of the truck in
12:02
the cab.
12:03
And I had a spot up high, seating on a roof so that the driver could stop the
12:13
truck and everyone'd run like mad to the field and hide yourself underneath
12:19
a bush or something, whatever you have.
12:22
So I was one crew up [?] , the bomb came down just in a straight line
12:32
maybe a few 100 yards, go across our
12:36
path, on the highway.
12:38
That was pretty close but it didn't hurt us.
12:42
We managed to get out by the next of middle of the day.
12:46
The driver was a
12:51
so tired and eyes were all red.
12:55
She was swerving all the time but nonetheless she just keep on going.
13:01
Finally arrived to the place, the small city, just coming off another railroad.
13:11
We united with my father.
13:14
So
13:17
that was a... later on I stayed there for almost 2 or 3 weeks waiting
13:24
to get news about a university.
13:28
We heard the university's moving now [?] , a university will be set up eventually,
13:38
but before too long Japanese army advanced to Nanking, which is very close to the
13:46
place I was staying at that time, so we decided, my father said well, you either
13:54
you'll go with me we'll go back westbound, or you can try to find a university.
14:00
Finally I
14:04
got a word the university had moved to a place not far from where I was staying,
14:11
but it was very tricky to get there.
14:16
I decided not to go with my father, who will... I'll have nothing to do...
14:23
not useful to anybody, so I took the tricky route, took a trail for about
14:32
100 km to the Yangtze River dam, and
14:40
I was supposed to take a ferry boat, go across the river to the
14:45
other side and took another train to another town and doubled back by
14:52
highway to go to this place where my university was at that time.
15:01
Well,
15:03
I got to this place on a...right along the river.
15:12
The Japanese Harbor was only about 30, 40 km away and bombing like
15:17
mad and there were literally tens of thousands of people waiting for
15:23
a ferry to go across the river.
15:26
Pretty desperate.
15:30
Impossible it was to get out of there.
15:34
During that time a siren sounded.
15:36
When the air raid siren sounded everybody, the crowd scattered.
15:41
Everybody's trying to hide.
15:44
I decide, well, it's too late for me to run.
15:48
If they want to bomb I actually couldn't get across anyway.
15:52
I stayed there.
15:54
Only a few of us stayed there.
15:56
When a ferry boat arrived
16:00
the bombing was over, we were the first few on board the ferry
16:05
so we got across safely and
16:11
took a train about 150 km away to meet my
16:17
classmate.
16:18
My classmate was my roommate on the campus.
16:26
So I didn't realize he was from a well-to-do family.
16:31
His family owns quite a few shops and pawn shop and a local bank, so he treat
16:39
me with very good food, having wine at
16:46
every meal.
16:48
But I told him we have to go to university.
16:52
He said, well, I don't want to go because I have no job.
16:54
You have no apartment.
16:57
I said, well, you stay here you won't get anywhere either.
17:01
I decided we would go, but by that time we realized, we learned
17:07
the bus system was not operating anymore, it was not operating.
17:13
So we had to hire a so-called rickshaw to carry our bags, and
17:22
we just walked, which is about
17:27
170 miles far.
17:30
Took us 3 days to get there, but the first day we were in serious
17:34
trouble because the rickshaw man, he was up to no good, you see.
17:41
So the closest, as soon as he stopped there and he wanted
17:51
to simply want
17:54
to do away with that.
17:57
Fortunately I did have a tube of a... a glass tube of a chemical in my
18:09
pocket, which was the only weapon I had.
18:13
It was liquid bromine, which when you put it out in the open
18:18
space kind of a brown fume coming out of there very, very potent.
18:24
So I said well, we have a new choice.
18:27
If you don't do anything, we're going to give you this stuff, throw it on your
18:32
face, then you'll be either blind or dead.
18:35
And he looked at us, he decided, well,
18:43
it's not worth to take the risk so he just dropped everything and left.
18:51
Oh.
18:51
So we had to get some help to getting to a city, a small town, hire another rickshaw.
18:59
Eventually 3 ½ days later we finally arrived at a
19:03
place which was back along the Yangtze River again, but it's about, oh maybe,
19:08
a couple hundred kilometers west of the place I left on a ferry boat.
19:14
At that time there were quite a few professors and students gathered
19:21
there, but it didn't take too long to realize that I could not stay
19:27
there because Japanese coming again.
19:30
So we were
19:34
put on a riverboat and went to Hangzhou, just farther north,
19:40
quite a few hundred kilometers.
19:43
This time more people from the university gathered together there to stay in
19:50
a French Concession in Hangzhou.
19:54
In those days foreign concession all over the place.
19:58
We stayed there, and the Japanese planes could bomb the place all the time.
20:06
Eventually the military at that location at that time arranged to move us out by
20:14
another riverboat and was going westbound and there's a place called Guangzhou.
20:19
It's a few, I think it's about a few, couple hundred
20:25
kilometers away.
20:29
We stayed there for only a couple days and get on a boat, another riverboat.
20:35
This was the type of boat can go out by way of the Yangtze Gorge,
20:39
which has to be high-powered.
20:43
This boat belonged to a British-owned company.
20:50
So we were there, we got on board, but before we finished loading
20:58
the siren sounded again so the captain decided we'll just get out of there
21:05
because he has no protection on a dock.
21:10
So we went straight to the Yangtze
21:16
Gorge, which is only 100 km away.
21:22
At that time the Chinese system for air raid alarm was pretty good.
21:29
So you have about a couple hours of warning.
21:33
They know when they took off and they know where they're going.
21:38
So he was able to get to the Yangtze Gorge just by the gorge,
21:44
miles of the Yangtze Gorge when the Japanese plane finally arrived.
21:49
And we realized down below underneath the deck it was 600
21:54
miles moved up for future use.
22:00
So we were, either you were hit, there
22:06
would be no hope.
22:08
But they managed to get to the gorge.
22:11
The gorge is very, very, even much more steeper slope than the Columbia Gorge.
22:20
So the planes could not, in those days, planes could not dive down so they
22:27
were watching...there were two or three bombs dropped, but they didn't hurt us.
22:33
Eventually after two days we finally arrived in that place which is
22:43
called Chongqing.
22:46
That's the place the military application had managed to get hold of a big
22:53
house, a house that belonged to a
22:58
warlord.
22:58
I would say probably 5-600 rooms in that house way up on a hill.
23:05
You had to walk for 6 miles, not 6 miles, 2 miles, 16 Chinese Li to get there.
23:18
So we were up there for a couple, three months.
23:25
Nothing to do.
23:27
Just wait.
23:28
A student arrived who--what can we do?
23:31
We can't even go to class there couldn't do...depends on the course.
23:39
I think there was 2, 3 months after that the military decided to
23:45
merge us with another university called Central University.
23:50
So we move again westbound to Tonkin, that's the
23:57
capital of the Republic of China during those years, during the war years.
24:08
They didn't have any use for us, so they put us in an institute
24:12
of translation compilation, which means, translate the English word;
24:20
try to devise a dictionary, English-Chinese dictionary of
24:25
chemistry or natural science.
24:27
So I spent a lot of, oh, at least 6 months doing that kind of a job
24:35
getting paid by staying in a small apartment with four people in a room.
24:41
But that was after that point.
24:45
Okay.
24:46
How did you get to the U.S. and to Oregon State?
24:51
After that,
24:56
one day I got a letter from my friend, really a friend of my father, but he
25:01
is quite younger than my father, saying that at that time he was in Hong Kong
25:09
managing an office for purchasing and
25:14
evaluation, technical evaluation for the Minister of Communication.
25:19
So I need help.
25:20
I know you know some English and you can, if you want to
25:26
help me, you come to Hong Kong.
25:30
So I grabbed the opportunity.
25:32
I traveled by bus for 4 or 5 days from Tonkin all the way to Hong Kong, and then
25:39
I got the job there for, let me see now,
25:47
for about a year and a half, almost two years,
25:53
at which time my assignment was
25:58
to purchase trucks,
26:02
well, equipment apparatus, fuel, tire and also oversee the
26:12
transportation move to Haiphong.
26:15
Haiphong is very close to Hanoi, it's in Indochina.
26:19
In fact, there was a travelling between Hong Kong and Haiphong seven times.
26:24
That's a long story.
26:25
I don't want to go into detail, but it was kind of a funny operation there.
26:32
Actually not funny, it was kind of scary because Japanese spy were after us.
26:40
So our office has no sign, it's built inside a barber shop.
26:49
In fact, the sabotage in Indochina was pretty bad.
26:57
They burned about 20,000 tires that were put in
27:05
the storage yard.
27:08
One time we moved 1,000 trucks from Haiphong to inland to China
27:14
with the highway, northbound from
27:22
Hanoi.
27:23
By the time we get to China, to the border line, we lost probably;
27:29
oh, we lost maybe one third.
27:33
Factory stolen, punctured tires, Japanese be hiring a lot of Vietnamese
27:39
to do a job, which at a dime a piece they would puncture tire, take care
27:47
of the sabotage.
27:48
I get the impression Vietnamese was heavily suppressed, very poor.
27:55
But
27:57
that's the reason why later on when we had a war in Vietnam, my statement
28:03
at that time was in part with the wind because people over there
28:08
they had sunk to the bottom now.
28:09
They had nothing to - they don't even care
28:15
about their own life.
28:18
Anyway, after almost a year and a half in Hong Kong, my fiancé taken from Shanghai,
28:30
this was my aunt's daughter, but we don't have any blood relations because
28:34
it was my stepmother's sister's daughter,
28:40
talked to me and also a professor of mine came back from Indonesia-based
28:49
on their advice I decided I'd give up the high-pay job
28:55
to go to a university, called West China Union University, a Christian
29:00
university as a research assistant, which
29:08
wasn't a high paying job.
29:10
I think
29:12
my pay rate was dropped by a factor of eight.
29:20
Oh
29:22
boy.
29:22
At that time my father was not too far away from the university.
29:28
So
29:30
before too long after I took a job, I think it was about a year, not even a
29:36
year later, I got married with my wife.
29:43
So I stayed as a research assistant for about a year.
29:47
I met a chairman by name of Roy C. Spooner [?] . He said, well, I think
29:55
you can do some teaching for us.
29:58
So I will have to teach general chemistry for home economic
30:03
students and pharmacy students.
30:05
I [unintelligible] until next year he promoted me to instructor
30:10
to teach general chemistry for science school, for science student.
30:16
That did not make a lot of people happy, but anyway, but I did have
30:21
a good relationship there which was Spooner and at that time my wife,
30:31
this was my first wife, also was
30:38
teaching at another university on the same campus.
30:43
This is the university called Nanking University, moved from Nanking to
30:49
merge with West China Union University.
30:52
In fact, there was four universities together at that time.
30:57
So my son was born at that time.
31:02
And to make a long story short after five years, after four years,
31:11
Roy Spooner told me one day, he said well, I think it's about time for you
31:17
to get some advanced education, and I'll send out some letters to find out.
31:25
He did send some letters out, and I did get two offers: one from Oregon
31:31
State and one from Penn State.
31:40
Right after we left Hong Kong,
31:44
which was before the second war was declared.
31:53
So of course Japanese took over all the concessions in China.
31:59
There's a number of international French concessions.
32:00
Of
32:03
course after Pearl Harbor...
32:07
no, I need to go back.
32:10
When I was in Hong Kong, war was
32:15
declared between Great Britain and Germany so that
32:25
when doing my studies at West China Union University,
32:31
the Pearl Harbor
32:36
event, or rather the tragedy happened.
32:40
So from there out there were quite a few American, the squadron of
32:47
American bombers were in town.
32:52
The Chinese farmer... 300,000 square feet, four outfield for the B-29 these
33:02
three months, so during that time I think we had as many as 200 B-29s.
33:11
So it's very sad to see the young pilots get drunk because the next
33:17
day or so are dispatched go to fly to Manchuria out of Tokyo to go bombing.
33:28
In
33:30
those days the B-29 was automated, where when
33:35
it took off sometimes the engine would catch fire, so they
33:42
lost quite a few people there.
33:45
It's pretty sad.
33:46
But eventually of course the situation turned better, and the
33:51
U.S. dropped the atom bomb and the Japanese army surrendered so let
33:59
us see.. that would not be '45 yet.
34:04
So
34:07
it was during that time I got an offer as a teaching assistant
34:12
at Oregon State or Penn State.
34:14
I accepted the
34:18
job at Oregon State because it's closer to China on the west coast
34:25
and applied for a passport and foreign change.
34:29
It was a very difficult job.
34:33
He says pure luck I was approved.
34:37
You were supposed to be approved by the highest leader.
34:41
I don't know who he is, but he's only approved about 30
34:45
people out of a few hundred.
34:48
So I took the, I left my wife in Chengdu, and I took my boy, our son, to fly to
34:57
Hong Kong by way of the China Airline, which they have a room with a bucket
35:06
seat, and from Hong Kong took a boat to Shanghai and left my boy with my
35:16
in-laws, and then I got on board an army transport, a U.S.
35:23
army transport, General Scott.
35:33
It took me... the concourse
35:38
left Shanghai I believe it was in 1946, March 21st and arrived in
35:51
Seattle.
35:53
During those 27 days it was very tricky because we really don't understand
36:00
the slang language and we were first time mixed up with a lot of GIs.
36:06
They're pretty rough character.
36:08
They gamble.
36:09
They brag.
36:10
They do other things,
36:13
and they used a lot of slang from back home.
36:16
I remember when we got ready to eat
36:20
and I remember they'd say "six bacon come to a mess hall" that means Cabin 6B.
36:30
Mess hall is a dining area.
36:35
My vocabulary I think is twenty, 5 years older than I am and someone the
36:42
same age as mine, while they_just lost.
36:47
But I had a few years' experience teaching at a Christian university,
36:54
so I was able to make out some things.
36:56
But anyway, finally we got into Seattle and I was very much impressed
37:01
by that Olympic mountain range.
37:05
It happened to be a fine day, so it was impressive.
37:10
And also of course we were shocked by the can-can dancer on board of
37:16
a tug boat who walked some GI home.
37:23
We were taken care dockside by the
37:30
Red Cross people, and they took us up and put up in a hotel.
37:37
It's kind of a pretty, pretty not very good hotel but in
37:44
those days it was pretty good.
37:47
Later on when I went back I had a difference way of looking at it.
37:53
Anyway, then I took a train to Albany, arriving on Oregon State
38:00
campus probably March 23rd.
38:04
Okay.
38:08
I was told the next day I would take a qualified examination.
38:12
It was kind of a... that's how I got to Corvallis.
38:19
Okay, so when you got here you started studying and teaching both?
38:23
I was a teaching assistant.
38:25
I was assigned to take of some laboratories.
38:28
It was pretty easy for me.
38:35
Academically I didn't have any problem, but I certainly did
38:38
have a problem with culture.
38:40
I recall in April sometime one day in the afternoon while guiding chemistry,
38:47
all the people came in, all the students came in dressed very funny, you
38:54
know, so called, the Sadie Hawkins day.
38:57
The girl students wearing hardly any shoe.
39:02
I said well, this will not do to do
39:07
experiments with ether, you're going to catch fire with nothing to protect you.
39:13
No die.
39:14
Of course they all laughed.
39:16
Oh, they said, you just don't understand, you're foreign, you
39:18
don't understand our system.
39:20
I said, well maybe I don't understand the new system but I do understand safety.
39:23
But they went to department head, Dr. Gilbert.
39:28
Gilbert after listening to my case, he said Wang you're right.
39:33
Told me I'm
39:36
right.
39:36
The lab was closed.
39:37
That was my first contact with the American culture.
39:43
Pretty kind of a college in my, in the rooming house and
39:50
I ate at a boy's house, what was called Heckert [?] place.
39:57
That was in '46.
40:00
by '47 I arranged to have my wife arrive here as a teaching assistant in
40:12
a physics department.
40:13
I got my master's degree, she got hers.
40:16
Unfortunately at the stroke of... by 1950 my wife became pretty ill
40:25
and in '51 in May she passed away.
40:30
At that time I was just graduate, and
40:38
China was by that time under the control of the communist regime government.
40:48
So
40:50
not much I could do, so I stay here as an instructor, and that was
40:58
the
41:02
beginning of the long stay for 31 years until I retire from Oregon State.
41:11
Okay.
41:12
Does that do the job for you?
41:15
Why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you do here now?
41:18
Huh?
41:18
Tell me a little bit about what you do here at Oregon State now.
41:23
Well, you see after I got an apprenticeship I taught for one year.
41:29
I started doing research with two professors and
41:35
I started using radioisotope as a research tool.
41:39
And before too long we were able to get grant money from the atomic energy
41:44
commission, so we did very well and then we published a lot of papers.
41:50
I was promoted to assistant professor and then
41:55
associate professor.
41:56
Then I taught a course in an area of how to use radioisotopes that
42:03
was forefront in the country.
42:06
So I also published quite a few papers, so I was promoted,
42:16
in a few more years was promoted associate professors.
42:17
Four more years
42:21
I was promoted full professor.
42:24
In
42:27
1958 I realized that this campus we do not have a facility to the job in teaching or
42:34
research in the area of using radiation.
42:37
So I proposed to get federal money to build a facility and there were
42:46
quite a few friends here, my colleague helped out, we had a committee, and we
42:55
were sending applications to
42:58
the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health,
43:00
and the Atomic Energy Commission.
43:03
We were turned down by either one agency, other agency a couple
43:07
times, but I was kind of stubborn.
43:11
The third time was a charm.
43:13
Finally we got money.
43:16
So we build a radiation center as the one build
43:32
in here now.
43:33
We by '62, we started construction in '64 we moved in.
43:35
So the center began to expand.
43:36
It was simply another application to National Science Foundation getting
43:39
more money to build a reactor, to the Atomic Energy Commission also.
43:44
So we were able to get the money by '67 the second portion of the
43:53
radiation center was complete.
43:54
The reactor was built and the reactor wasn't critical, so it became the
44:01
one of the few radiation center on the university campus in the country.
44:08
So we keep on going through the '70s.
44:13
Nuclear power was very popular.
44:17
In fact, at this point I should, you probably, you may not know, we will have
44:27
about 100 different power plants going on in operation right now.
44:34
In those days were highlight, the highpoint
44:38
of the nuclear power.
44:40
So the College of Engineering, Dean Burgess, talked to me and decide to set up
44:50
a department of engineering so we have a
44:55
department.
44:55
I will have, in Engineering, a radiation center with two operation.
45:01
So that was going on
45:05
in the '70s.
45:06
During the
45:08
second half of '70s
45:12
the environmentalist come and began to cause problem.
45:19
Nuclear power plant
45:23
people just couldn't afford a building, just takes too
45:25
much time and too much money.
45:29
So despite the fact in Oregon we built a treatment plant in early '70s, it
45:39
was a bargain, for only $500,000,000.
45:44
Nowadays it will cost over $2 billion.
45:46
At
45:48
that time also I was serving as the member and the chairman at one time on
45:54
state energy facility siting conference,
45:58
so I was go out to see [unintelligible]
46:04
. So the nuclear power had begun to, nobody can afford to build any
46:13
power plant anymore in the late, by
46:19
'79 all it stopped.
46:22
However, there was still quite a few of course under construction, and of course
46:28
also in this country relies heavily on nuclear submarine in defense program.
46:34
So the student of course could get very good job and enrollment dropped but still
46:42
managed to stay at a steady state now.
46:45
Of
46:48
course the center has many other activities, not only provide a
46:53
space for teaching, research, serve all the different state agency
47:01
and even have a lot of international
47:05
involvement with quite a few foreigners.
47:09
So this wasn't too long until
47:15
1985, by 1984 when I realized that it's about time for
47:21
me to retire, because I was already past 65.
47:26
So I retired in 1985... 1984, December 21st.
47:34
So this is my second year of retirement now.
47:37
It seems like you're still busy.
47:40
Well, I'm not doing too much now but just try to help the American Nuclear Society,
47:50
which
47:53
would [unintelligible] nuclear industry.
47:55
If we have another energy crisis, we will need a nuclear power.
48:00
If we do not continue our effort to have a group of people remain
48:05
to be active, before too long all the people will be scattered.
48:13
If we want to start again, we'll take another 6, 8 years to build up
48:17
industry.
48:19
Currently we're trying to win some foreign market.
48:26
In the open market will not get anywhere because French people
48:31
licensed from the United States they can do on their own now.
48:35
By year 2000 the French people will rely 80% of their electric
48:40
power be nuclear power.
48:45
So currently the U.S. Nuclear Industry is looking for marketing third world
48:50
country and small countries like Taiwan, Korea, and originally go to China and will
49:00
of course face tough competition from
49:04
French, from German outfit.
49:07
Those outfit learn that license from the United States to get technology,
49:14
and in Taiwan they competed with us.
49:19
So that's a pretty good complete story, actually.
49:23
Okay.
49:25
Do you have anything you want to add?
49:28
I don't think so, unless you
49:35
have any questions.
49:35
What are you going to do in the next three years?
49:35
Are you going to stay busy?
49:37
Hmm?
49:37
Are you going to stay busy in the next three years?
49:39
Well, I hope so if my health, right now I'm having hearing problems but
49:44
if that can be stabilized, I suppose I will stay active professionally.
49:53
Okay.
49:55
Okay?
49:56
Thank you.
49:56
Very good.
