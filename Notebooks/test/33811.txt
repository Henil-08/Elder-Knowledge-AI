00:01
Okay, we're gonna start with - her topics are family heritage is the first one.
00:07
-cause I have a little trouble hearing.
00:09
Oh, sorry!
00:10
Family heritage, that's the first one she wanted to start on - talking about.
00:14
Yeah.
00:15
My family heritage?
00:18
Yeah.
00:18
From the Choctaw Nation?
00:20
Uh, I'm not exactly sure what she means.
00:25
I think, as far as inherited.
00:28
Is there anything left from your family?
00:30
Your heritage.
00:31
I'm the last living member of my family.
00:31
In fact, I'm absolutely the last living member, uh
00:36
from a family of medicine people.
00:40
Particularly herbologist.
00:42
I still practice and still utilize Native American medicines, herbal medicines.
00:51
Examples are - use aspirin.
00:53
Aspirin's accumulative to the body so, uh, it is not good for you.
00:59
Where you can use, like catnip.
01:02
And make tea out of that and that acts very similar to an aspirin.
01:06
Only thing is, it's healthful to the body.
01:08
It also helps the blood.
01:09
Can you get that around here?
01:11
Catnip - catnip grow wild.
01:12
It's a member of the mint family.
01:15
Now not - you can't use all mints.
01:18
Cause some mints are poisonous.
01:20
You have to know the how do you use it.
01:23
A lot of herbs, even in a poisonous class, once you know how to use
01:27
them, you can use them safely!
01:30
Now of course, AMA has uh- hair stands up on the back of
01:33
their neck - and that's fine.
01:34
Course AMA is the authority, but they don't turn around and tell ya that
01:38
most of the patent medicines they have right now, in one way or another, came
01:43
directly from Native American resources.
01:46
And this has been proven time and time again!
01:51
Uh
01:55
- I'm from the Bear Clan.
01:58
Bear clan is like a family.
02:00
Your last name is what?
02:01
Mason.
02:02
Mason, okay.
02:03
So you and your family would not marry any of the Masons of your family.
02:08
O.K. - Bear clan means the same thing.
02:10
We do not inner-marry.
02:12
We cannot
02:12
marry into the Bear Clan.
02:13
We have to marry into the Wolf or the Eagle or the Snake.
02:17
But uh, cannot marry into Bear Clan.
02:19
It's forbidden.
02:21
Is it - but it's not related like Bear family is it?
02:25
Oh yes.
02:27
They're all blood related?
02:28
In one way or another.
02:29
I mean right on down to distant cousins and everything else.
02:32
You wouldn't marry your cousin.
02:34
Well this is how we maintain separation.
02:39
And it was formed into clans.
02:41
We adopted the animal that most represented us and our feelings.
02:47
In our case, uh, the Bear.
02:50
The power - the strength - the cunning, and it can eat anything!
02:58
[both laughing]
03:00
Well aren't they vegetarian?
03:00
I thought they were vegetarian.
03:03
Well - I don't know it you can call it vegetarian or not.
03:06
Great-Grandfather now, when I was very small - I, like a lot
03:11
of other kids, you know modern today, throw their nose up at food.
03:16
You know, spinach or something like that.
03:19
Well let me try this one for a diet!
03:22
Great-Grandfather got - he was one that raised me when I was VERY small
03:26
- until the - your government came and took us off reservations, and sent
03:30
us to this nice, Christian schools.
03:33
We'll discuss that later!
03:35
Uh, anyway,
03:38
I guess it's inherent in children - I don't know - for them to throw up their
03:42
nose, and get picky about stuff like that.
03:44
It happens in most of our people to.
03:46
Well Great-Grandfather had a great way of settling these problems.
03:52
Seems that I got a little bit out of hand over the food that was being fed.
03:57
Course you know, we weren't strangers to hamburgers either,
04:00
that particular era, because some of the garbage that was shipped to
04:03
us down on Indian Row in Oklahoma.
04:06
In fact we got to the point you know, we got into candy and things like that.
04:11
Course,
04:13
that's normal.
04:14
And uh, we started getting pretty damn picky.
04:16
I and other kids.
04:18
And then uh,
04:20
well I'm part of a, of seven children, part of a triplet and the only living one.
04:29
Of seven?
04:30
Of
04:32
seven.
04:32
Of seven child I'm the only one living.
04:34
And uh, they used to make a joke about Father - they called him Fertile Turtle,
04:40
'cause he started it at - having his children when he was sixty-three.
04:46
Was - you were only eight years old when he died?
04:47
Weren't you?
04:48
That's right.
04:49
Yep.
04:50
Was your Mother around?
04:52
Mom
04:56
- Well Mom, like me, breed, except that she suffered a much
05:01
heavier hell for being a Breed.
05:03
And the fact that you know, when was out of the Kwakiutl up in Canada - and
05:08
uh, already a Breed, cause it was either her mother or grandmother had
05:12
been married to a Russian fur trapper.
05:16
And uh, that broke the Great Law up there.
05:19
You know, she married outside the people.
05:21
And then, uh my Father was full blood - broke the Law.
05:27
He married her.
05:28
In fact, he was banned from every returning.
05:32
He could never, you know, in fact to this day, we do not
05:34
even know where he's buried.
05:36
How do you feel about that?
05:37
Do you - are you unhappy.
05:39
I mean you're happy that he married your Mom, but would you rather have
05:42
him not being banned - being apart.
05:47
No.
05:47
Well I have to go with the feeling of my people.
05:50
Uh, he broke the law.
05:53
And that was wrong.
05:55
I am not happy about it, unfortunately.
05:59
I don't make a statement of malice or anything else like this but, I think
06:05
he insulted me by giving me the other bloods that are in me, and uh because
06:13
now I have to live with that stigma.
06:17
From you know, my own people, and other Native Americans.
06:21
I'm looked at even as less, and it's bad enough in the white world to be debased,
06:26
but we are debased by our own people.
06:29
Uh, you know, you're a man without a country.
06:33
Are there many full-blooded Indians left?
06:36
It doesn't seem like-
06:36
No - there are not many full bloods left.
06:39
Of any nation?
06:40
Choctaw-
06:42
No, no.
06:44
Uh, I would say under 200,000.
06:48
Under 200,000, and those that are full-blood, are either dying out, some are
06:55
becoming simulated into the system, and have left the traditional aspect - or have
07:00
been forced out of the traditional aspect.
07:05
Or uh, or are totally protected!
07:09
Such as in our people's case, you'll find most of the breeds
07:13
we have are in Oklahoma.
07:16
It's a little game that Jackson played back in the 1830's.
07:19
I think you call it - well you know it as the Trail of Tears.
07:23
Yeah, it was 1832.
07:25
1832,
07:30
or 1836.
07:31
But Mr. Jackson, his liars now, where he made promises to us, and then turned
07:32
right around and invariably turned right around and stuck us in the back.
07:39
By turning around and saying "We want to move all tribes with the letter
07:42
C", how the Seminole got in there I don't know, but I guess it sounded like
07:52
the letter C.
07:52
Uh hum.
07:52
So.
07:52
[chuckles] The Choctaw Nation, well I don't know whether you want to
07:55
call it Nation, we were a Republic.
08:01
Very democratic.
08:01
Agricultural.
08:06
And we were the largest tribe east of the Mississippi.
08:10
And, in fact, were right on the Mississippi.
08:13
We weren't the meanest, but we were the largest, which took care of the meanest!
08:16
And uh, we were responsible for
08:23
teaching the weihoch, the white people and the French and the British,
08:27
stuff like that, to navigate the Mississippi River from the Great
08:29
Lakes all the way down to the gulf.
08:31
What did you call em?
08:32
Wa-ho?
08:32
Weihoch.
08:33
Weihoch.
08:34
White Spiders.
08:36
It's a Cheyenne word.
08:39
My native lived around the Cheyenne and the Sioux, Arapahos, and those,
08:44
and picked up terms like that.
08:47
You know, the stick because we were so invariable strict!
08:52
Not only of our heritage, but our language, our religion, everything.
08:55
Including our names.
08:57
We'll talk about that later.
09:00
But anyway, we were responsible for the teaching of the navigation of the
09:04
Mississippi River, which was passed on, and passed on, and passed on!
09:08
The Choctaw Republic was a kind of a commerce tribe.
09:13
Traded inner-tribally.
09:16
Very much up and down the river.
09:18
Okay.
09:19
And the origin of the Choctaw are the mounds.
09:21
And particularly one specific mound.
09:23
I don't know where it is.
09:24
Great-grandfather told me when I was very small, but uh, like I been pushed
09:30
so far away by, almost beyond my control, that I have never been able to get back.
09:38
Sit down and really learn that, okay - you were asking about the "Bloods".
09:42
Now the Bloods are in Mississippi, still down on the delta.
09:44
There's a small group of em.
09:46
And they're very, very protected.
09:47
I mean I can go down there, and I can visit, but I cannot stay overnight.
09:56
And I do not blame them.
09:58
I figure it's a curse my father left!
10:02
And I know, honor thy Father, honor thy Mother, but that's your white man's book.
10:06
Okay.
10:08
The great comic book.
10:11
As we'll find out later.
10:14
Okay.
10:14
Let's see.
10:15
Well what kind of communities have you lived in?
10:17
While you've been growing up?
10:21
I gave you a paper on one of 'em, the other day, and that was the Indian
10:25
Schools, which were - Okay - born in California, down in Sacramento.
10:34
And I shortly after I was born, Dad, you know back in Oklahoma, his family
10:42
with him, and we were there for a while.
10:49
And then the De-Indianization program, the 1920's and 30's.
10:53
This is a Federal program to take the Indians off the Reservation.
10:58
And make 'em white.
11:00
And uh, you know, it's tragic, as the more I learn about it even today,
11:08
that some of the ways they did it.
11:11
Such as threatening the parents, that uh you will not get your per diem, whatever
11:17
it is the government gives, so called money the government is supposed to give
11:20
us, us if we were not good little Indians.
11:22
You know, and if we didn't relinquish the children.
11:26
Things like this.
11:29
And uh, they took us off the reservations and shipped us a good distance, the
11:37
schools you went to were never close.
11:38
Where you could run away and go home.
11:41
They, most times, shipped you over 2,000 miles.
11:44
They shipped us from there, up into northern Washington.
12:01
How old were you then?
12:01
When they sent you to the schools?
12:01
Oh - [pause] imagine around seven years old.
12:03
And that's - were you living with your Grandfather then?
12:06
Great - well, Great-Grandfather and Dad.
12:08
Dad was killed a year later.
12:10
Mom had already - well Mom was in and out, just put it that way.
12:13
And any time she'd come in, she'd have a baby, and uh - she'd go away!
12:19
[laughing]
12:20
Well it, it, it was a rather tragic thing to see, because uh
12:26
again, it was the blood issue.
12:29
And since she was not Choctaw people, and vice versa you know, I'm treated
12:33
the same way as when I go to Kwakiutl.
12:34
I go up to Kwakiutl - I've been up to the reservation in Vancouver,
12:37
in British Columbia, and uh,
12:44
it's as if the name never even existed up there.
12:47
Her name.
12:49
I can't get any information on her or anything.
12:52
It's just as if she was never born!
12:55
She must have been - I'm here [laughs].
12:59
Do you know anything about her history?
12:59
Very little.
13:00
I know some of the Kwakiutl history.
13:02
I've attended a couple of potlatches.
13:04
Is she still alive?
13:05
No.
13:06
No, no.
13:07
She's dead - as far as I know.
13:09
From what, like I say, it's awful hard to get information when information
13:13
is not as you probably have already found out - that most Native
13:17
American don't even want to talk.
13:20
And I can tell you later why they will not talk.
13:24
But uh, it was based on mainly blood issues.
13:29
In,
13:34
as I was already at the government school about a year when I received
13:38
word that my cousin had killed my Dad.
13:40
My cousin was
13:43
kind of, you know, well, he wasn't playing with a full deck.
13:46
He was typical - atypical - totally debased individual that, uh, suffered
13:55
a very heavy drinking problem.
13:58
And a very very heavy psychological problem.
14:01
And uh, I guess him and Dad got into it one day and the
14:09
cousin decided to go ahead and skin him.
14:15
So - that pretty much left it there.
14:17
Well anyway, the government schools - they still exist.
14:26
They are still, as far as I can determine, what happens at 'em is still suppressed.
14:35
I find them revolting to say the least - debasing - counterproductive.
14:46
Give you an example.
14:46
They sent me there to strip me and make me white.
14:51
Now, in 500 years of fighting, no Indian has turned white!
14:54
Let's fact it - I mean.
14:58
You might shoot a gun and your skin turns white.
14:59
Great!
15:00
Okay.
15:02
You'll find something out about Indians, as you go along here.
15:05
But anyway, the
15:10
government school created a great deal of psychological problems
15:13
when I was young, and uh, there are still lingering elements of it.
15:17
There is a very, very deep inset mistrust of uh,
15:25
of promises.
15:27
More or less, you will hear the term if you've been around Native
15:31
Americans, that uh, "Well when I talk to him, I'm gonna stand sideways." And
15:38
what it means is that,
15:41
that man's honor is hobbling down.
15:43
I'm not gonna face him.
15:45
You know, it's like talking to a liar's mouth.
15:47
It's not good.
15:49
So, you take it with a grain of salt.
15:51
Stand sideways, you know.
15:52
When we went to the native longhouse that's the way - they were real uh,
15:56
leary.
15:57
Most of the people we talked to.
15:58
Well,
16:04
I'm excited that your instructor has sent an individual like you out
16:09
to feel what debasement is like.
16:14
And distrust.
16:17
More or less, you're sitting here - and you're maybe in your mind
16:20
think "Does he trust me? I mean he's gonna talk to me, but does he really
16:25
trust me?" Well that's something that you're gonna have to decide.
16:27
It's something that you have to
16:33
decide.
16:33
You have to earn the trust.
16:37
Your eyes are good.
16:38
See, Mouth talk all it want.
16:40
Eyes talk more.
16:42
Your eyes are good - because if your eyes weren't, I wouldn't - you
16:47
couldn't pay me enough to talk.
16:49
My Mom says my eyes are really expressive, sometimes that's scary.
16:53
Cause sometimes I don't want people to know what I'm thinking.
16:55
That's okay, that's okay, until they turn around and say they're
16:58
bedroom eyes, or something like that.
16:59
But, there's nothing wrong with that either.
17:02
But, anyway - the Government schools were a lesson in horror.
17:11
Absolute horror.
17:14
In this one paragraph, you used "I was trembling so badly I puked. And then
17:18
a white fellow slapped the hell out of me and made me eat the mess that came
17:21
from my fear." That really happened?
17:23
Oh yes!
17:24
Yes.
17:26
Yes, uh I puked, and he made me get down and lick it up.
17:31
Is this when you first went?
17:32
At seven, eight years old?
17:33
I asked to recall everything that happened then, in California when
17:38
I was attending college down there, strange - I hated the individual for
17:45
making me do this, this was an English course, and he gave me an ultimatum.
17:52
That you write about first person, singular, the thing you hated
17:57
the most...or flunk the course.
18:03
But if you wrote the paper, that would be the only paper you
18:06
have to write in in the course.
18:08
It, you know, if it was grammatically correct and everything like that.
18:11
He just wanted to know if you could creatively write first person singular.
18:16
And uh, he kept harping at me, and harping at me and uh, I finally
18:20
reached a point where, you know, I started standing sideways.
18:24
And I turned around and faced him once, and I said
18:28
"Under protest I will write this paper - but if I ever hear of another
18:32
student being forced to write it again, I will advise them that they are
18:36
entitled to their rights of privacy, and this - what I have to say is private."
18:40
Could you have gone around him - I mean could you have done something else?
18:44
Not told him?
18:47
Why?
18:47
And uh, be like the white people?
18:52
I'm sorry.
18:53
You know, but you know, you can't go around and
19:01
practice what you hate!
19:04
We, you know, I have a lot of very, very dear white friends.
19:09
I do not see no color with them.
19:13
And then I know a lot of white people, and I get in trouble every once in a while
19:18
cause somebody'll do something or pull some kind of stunt or something like that.
19:22
And I'll turn around and say "Well that was very white of you."
19:27
And uh, now occasionally you'll hear me call somebody a weihocha.
19:30
And that was not a compliment...
19:33
That is anything but a compliment.
19:34
It is about - see there is no profanity in the Native American languages.
19:39
Profanity is a Latin-based piece of garbage.
19:43
You go to Asia, you know, amongst the Orientals or anything else.
19:47
There is no profanity in their languages.
19:50
Same thing with the Native American languages... There is no profanity!
19:53
But there are references to [chuckles] a wahohotcha is uh, I think probably
19:58
the lowest that that could be called upon other than white person, and then
20:02
you say the person's a White Spider.
20:05
And do you trust spiders?
20:06
No.
20:07
Okay.
20:09
Saying what that means is that the white person spins the web
20:12
that tangles the Indian's feet.
20:13
The Indian is free - or was - and uh, so he cannot move his feet.
20:20
So he cannot dodge the new weapons that the white man is throwing.
20:24
Because he cannot move quick enough.
20:28
So that is the lowest element in Native American language which you could reach.
20:32
Wahoo hotcha.
20:36
And the term is Cheyenne, and a very good - Cheyenne being human being
20:45
- and you'll hear words from a lot of different Native American languages.
20:48
Well I've gone in and worked on Reservations all over the United States.
20:53
Now there are no reservations in Oklahoma - it's now called Indian Row.
20:57
It's just as sure what the government is doing - they have taken everything!
21:01
We have nothing left.
21:03
The last of what we had which was taken, you know, forty years ago.
21:07
And that's it!
21:07
That was shortly, you know, shortly after we went to government school.
21:13
But from the government schools; we were forbidden
21:19
to think Indian; forbidden to practice any part of our language; forbidden
21:25
to speak any part of our language; we were beaten, physically beaten for it.
21:28
We were handcuffed over a bench and beaten.
21:32
To fraternize with other Indians, particularly the opposite sex,
21:37
uh - any time that we were to talk, we were to talk in English.
21:42
Did you learn those rules quickly, or were you kind a rebellious or-
21:46
Well I'll put it this way.
21:50
Now I have been through many of your colleges out here.
21:54
Because I'm tired of being called a dumb you-know-what Indian.
21:57
And uh, the only way I can describe it is - the Pavlov's Dog effect!
22:03
What do you mean by that?
22:03
You know what Pavlov's Dog is?
22:06
It was an experiment done by Pavlov, a psychologist who turned around and
22:14
had a dog respond more or less - you rang a bell, he'd go get some food.
22:20
And then um, but if you didn't want him to go get some food,
22:24
then you would shock him.
22:26
See?
22:27
You'd get him to do things, or get him not to do things.
22:29
Like this, and then after a while, it became that he'd been hurt so
22:33
many times, or rewarded so many times - after a bit, uh, it was not
22:38
so much what happened to the dog, but the secondary effect is that the bell
22:43
would ring - the saliva would come up.
22:46
But what would you so, see?
22:49
So it's, it's total control
22:51
total control of an element, or total control of thought, total control of
22:56
action, for fear of being hurt and the, you know, the anticipation of reward.
23:05
It's all based on the bell.
23:07
How were you rewarded?
23:10
Just by not getting beaten?
23:11
I don't think we were rewarded.
23:18
Beating was so common that I can be hit in the face today,
23:22
and just smile and laugh at you.
23:23
I can be physically slugged and just stand there and smile or laugh at
23:27
ya, then I'll go from there.
23:31
That's what has scared a lot of fellows that I have run into.
23:35
And particularly in is, is that somebody'll punch me, and I'll turn
23:40
around and smile at him, and then clean him up with a beer bottle.
23:46
After a while, you go beyond what they call pain.
23:51
Insult is only so deep, that pain is not even a question!
23:57
How long were you at the Christian boarding school?
24:00
Well it was supposedly run by Christians.
24:06
[deep sigh]
24:06
Doesn't sound like it.
24:09
It's, it was very, very tragic.
24:13
We were there until they were closed.
24:17
And then we were sent to orphanages, but to give you an example: we had the white
24:24
religion crammed down our throat, and were told we were filthy, and we were dirty.
24:28
And we were Godless, and we were this - and in fact some of your religious books
24:31
today even, turn around and say that of another color is, you know, Godless,
24:38
something that I could never understand!
24:41
Which also reminds me about the - Jane and Tom books that we had in the school.
24:48
But uh, it was so tragic, you know, that to say we were Godded this and we were
24:54
Godded that, and God wouldn't accept this, and well we were just totally told
25:02
that we were even less than animals.
25:06
And uh, we were convinced of it.
25:08
I mean, by starvation, by physical beatings, by uh being
25:17
locked outside in the cold.
25:20
Inclement weather, various things.
25:23
We were handcuffed to the bed.
25:26
Things I don't even like to remember.
25:30
Because I cannot believe a human being would do that to another human being!
25:34
I mean killing is okay, you know, don't let him suffer - but this here,
25:38
you wouldn't even do to an animal.
25:40
And uh, the people did - and they were sanctioned to go ahead and do
25:44
it - and in any way that they chose.
25:46
Well the young lady that I had come up with in the Government school, we had
25:51
both wound up in the same orphanage.
25:54
Down in central California, and uh, well - she was I believe
26:07
she was nine years old
26:10
- and the same animal that
26:13
beat hell out of me and everything else, raped her.
26:17
She was nine.
26:18
But see, we had no recourse!
26:20
Had nowhere to go!
26:21
You can't turn around and say "He raped me" cause they'd turn around "Aw..."
26:25
How old were you then?
26:27
I was seven.
26:27
And uh,
26:33
he didn't make any bones about hiding it or anything else - he
26:38
just hauled off and raped her.
26:42
And it was, you know - up to that point, she was pretty, how do you call it,
26:48
pretty fragile as it was, but that took the total, total wind out of her sail.
26:54
Uh, it, it took that spark of life that you see in people.
26:59
Hers died right there.
27:01
And then, when we went down to the orphanage down in central California,
27:05
the person that headed that orphanage turned around and said, after they
27:09
explained everything else to us, he said "And also, you will become Christians"
27:13
And she committed suicide the next day.
27:16
Citing she'd rather be dead than be Christian!
27:20
And we were, she was about - she was twelve years old then.
27:27
So... these are memories that I have to live with.
27:30
And then people ask me "Well, how do you come out here and trust?"
27:37
And the only thing I can say is that
27:41
"I trust - yes -but not like you."
27:47
We cannot be at war forever.
27:51
I think it is time for you people to understand us.
27:56
You have asked, in fact demanded, that we understand you - all the way down to
27:59
the point of total debasement, slavery, anything else that you want to call it.
28:06
It's not right.
28:11
I'm left with a funny taste
28:14
in my mouth.
28:14
And then - I still see it go on today.
28:18
I want to be out here, but now I'm asking myself a lot of questions.
28:23
Maybe I want to go to the hill.
28:26
Go away from you people all together.
28:27
It's um, [sigh] it's
28:33
hard to live out here - and be what I am - or what I'm supposed to be.
28:39
Out here in the N.W.?
28:39
Is that what you mean?
28:41
No.
28:42
In the white world.
28:44
And be what I am.
28:47
When everything you have out here is in total contradiction.
28:52
I
28:55
feel like all of me is missing.
28:58
I have no identity.
29:02
I mean it was just a few years ago that I got my name back.
29:07
Twenty-two years in court to get that name back.
29:11
I was stripped of it, and I, you know, when you were just finding
29:16
out what your name was, you know!
29:19
And uh, I'm not the only one.
29:23
There's thousands and thousands of us that were stripped!
29:28
Stripped of everything, you know, and it's, it's hard to go back
29:32
and think about these things.
29:33
I think now is the time that it should be put down of paper.
29:39
Because, it is a consistent psychological battle.
29:45
I mean, it's discriminatory all the way down to the university level.
29:50
In higher education - I should say all the way up!
29:54
In fact, flagrantly discriminatory!
29:56
Just in requirements at the university.
30:02
In your Bachelor of Arts degree, you're required foreign language
30:08
-and to this day I cannot understand, I cannot understand it, you know
30:13
it does not work upstairs as to why
30:18
I should be forced to go take a language in the name of Humanities,
30:28
you know, Spanish, Latin, French, German - when I was so brutally stripped
30:35
of my Native tongue, thoughts and ideas.
30:43
It's a double standard!
30:44
It's, you know, well what is the word you use when - it's hypocritical.
30:52
I mean, here you've stripped the Indian, indigenous, sacred people of everything
30:57
they have, then you turn around and saying "For one more insult, I'll just let him
31:02
study German - he can become German."
31:06
Did you ever ask a German what they felt about that?
31:11
You ought to talk to a German some time, and ask them what they think about what
31:15
has happened over here and is still happening with the Native Americans.
31:19
You're liable to get an ear full!
31:22
Ask the Japanese.
31:25
Ask the Koreans.
31:27
You travelled all around the world.
31:29
Did you travel in Japan and Korea?
31:31
I spent two and a half years in Japan.
31:35
And uh, have threatened very, very thoroughly frequently, and
31:39
even to this day, of returning.
31:41
Become a "bamboo Yankee".
31:42
I
31:48
learned a lot about life there, and I learned about you
31:52
know, my feelings, in Japan.
31:54
I was collecting what is called Minyo.
31:56
It's Japanese folk music.
31:59
You know, tunes like Hakatubushi [?] all different tunes like this.
32:06
And uh, I, I'm interested in other people.
32:10
Deeply, deeply interested.
32:11
I guess that's the only reason I'm still out here.
32:13
'Cause it's that I can't learn enough.
32:16
I want to know more - I want to know why they act like this.
32:20
As far as the white race is concerned, I don't know if there's any more to learn.
32:25
I think we've seen enough.
32:26
Now it's time to know more about the people.
32:30
About the [unclear] because, you know.
32:35
Sure there have been wars and this stuff like this,
32:40
I see more of a kinship amongst the Japanese, and amongst the Polynesians,
32:47
and the Mexicans, the Greeks and even the east Indians, than I
32:56
would ever find amongst the Waho.
32:59
It's you know,
33:03
if there's a religion I would stand to out here, it probably would be Jewish, but no,
33:08
I belong to the Native American church.
33:10
And of course, right now the hair stands up on the back of their necks, they're
33:13
gonna hear this, "Oh he's another one of those dopers." Well I expect that
33:18
from the white mans' way of thinking.
33:20
That you know, they got their and they, you know, they eat peyote, and
33:24
they, you know, get all fucked up!
33:26
Excuse the expression.
33:29
The white man eats the peyote, and gets messed up.
33:34
To us it is a very, high religious thing, is to go see the vision.
33:39
And there's great preparation for it.
33:40
It is no, we just don't sit down and pop 'em in out mouth and
33:43
say whoopee, here we go again.
33:46
It's not that way.
33:48
Even our religion is treated with dirt.
33:52
A lack of understanding I think would be the thing, the breakdown in communication,
33:56
the break-down in understanding.
33:57
And I can't understand this because your people came to
34:03
this, this great land, because of
34:11
the same problems that you heap upon us today.
34:15
Religion.
34:17
Yours was in persecution.
34:21
But I ask, then why do you come and persecute us?
34:26
Our religion has gone back 25,000 years.
34:31
It hasn't changed.
34:32
It's beautiful!
34:34
It works.
34:38
Yours,
34:40
barely 2,000 years old.
34:42
What does the Government say when, I mean - they're not following in the Constitution,
34:49
you know, as far as Indians are concerned.
34:53
They just ignore it.
34:58
I think this Government is ashamed and when they get ashamed
35:03
of something, what they do is ignore it - maybe it'll go away.
35:09
But uh, what is happening is they are creating even a bigger battle later.
35:16
They are creating their downfall, they are creating their weakness.
35:21
Because another nation will see this weakness
35:26
and they will work on that weakness.
35:28
And you, as a government,
35:33
will cease to be.
35:37
Because your religion, your government,
35:43
your ideas, are based on oneness of greed!
35:47
How much can I get my hands on - you know.
35:50
For me.
35:52
Instead of the total outward,
35:57
the, see...in the Native American world,
36:04
there are two stark differences.
36:07
The first one: is - it is not the individual's need
36:17
- it is the need of the group combined.
36:23
Not the individual's need, it is the group combined.
36:27
What is good for the group - what is good for all
36:32
of it.
36:32
Okay.
36:37
Your government talk,
36:42
and that's all it does.
36:44
It talk.
36:45
It write fancy papers,
36:48
and then I believe it also has amnesia.
36:55
Because you can't get them to honor their paper.
36:59
Their honor has hobbled down.
37:02
It's a disgrace.
37:03
Like I said, it's a liar's mouth.
37:06
I have hard time talking to anybody in the bureaucracy.
37:10
I cannot stand and face 'em.
37:13
Because I know when they open their mouth - it's the same thing that
37:15
comes out the backside of a dog!
37:19
It's the same thing, all the time.
37:22
The other thing: that totally remains baffling to I and most Native
37:28
Americans, is your innate demand
37:35
that we must have a government
37:40
like yours.
37:43
We have to elect leaders, and they make rules and it's by majority vote - or,
37:49
let's take this picture of majority vote.
37:54
In your way, out here, majority vote means that the people will come in and vote.
37:59
They vote "yes" or "no" and the numbers of "yes" or "no's" dominate
38:05
and what is left to the abstentions go to a majority vote - "yes" or "no".
38:16
That is so foreign to us - it's like having teepees and buffalos on a freeway!
38:21
In rush hour traffic.
38:24
It's something we cannot even comprehend.
38:28
We do not have a centralized government!
38:34
There is no such centralized government.
38:36
It was the consensus of all - and we do not do things in a hurry.
38:41
We take our time - go back and think about it -What is good for the all.
38:46
Now, well let's get this piece of paper through and those
38:50
that don't like it can suffer!
38:51
We consider everybody.
38:53
Do you have one leader?
38:54
A Chief?
38:55
We have chiefs.
38:56
In amongst the Choctaws, he's called Mingo.
38:59
M-I-N-G-O.Mingo.
39:01
Yes we have a Chief, but that's - again see, selected by consensus.
39:05
He is an unofficial leader, just like the Medicine Man, is again
39:10
is a form of unofficial leader.
39:12
The Medicine Man, and the Chief are probably two of the loneliest
39:16
of the people amongst the people.
39:19
Because, they are, again, set apart.
39:26
In fact, about the only person that would own his, own his own teepee
39:32
or lodge, would be a Medicine Man.
39:34
Your Grandfather was a Medicine man?
39:36
Yes.
39:37
And my Grandfather, Great-Grandfather, his Grandfathers - uh, as far as
39:43
from what Great-Grandfather says, uh, back all the way to the time
39:50
when we were in the Great North.
39:52
Where the skies were rainbows.
39:56
So he always tells me the borealis - guess so that means back before the time, before
40:02
we became what is called the "Disowned".
40:05
Before we broke the Great Law and came south.
40:07
And to not return.
40:09
See we are Longhouse People, and as lodge tales have it, we had left up
40:17
there and found hunting and comfort and everything else down here - so good that
40:24
our people started migrating down, and staying longer, and longer and longer.
40:28
Eventually did not return, and this broke the Great Law.
40:32
So, uh, we became the Disowned, and later what you call the Five Civilized Tribes.
40:38
The word Civilized Tribes does not mean, you know,
40:44
how do you say it, ran around in Brooks Brothers suits of anything
40:47
- you know - it means agricultural.
40:49
We were farming Indians.
40:50
Were you hunting and gathering before that?
40:52
Have you always been agricultural,
40:58
or were you a hunting and gathering - You just - Choctaw [unclear]
40:59
. Uh
41:02
I am not sure.
41:04
I'm really not sure.
41:08
See, I didn't have enough time with Great-Grandfather.
41:12
Like I said, I'm so sorely hurt by being stripped of so much that I should have
41:18
known - and that I'm trying to learn now.
41:21
In fact, see, I'm going through an inversion of what has been taught!
41:27
To go back and find out where I came from - and why I feel like I feel.
41:34
Why is the taste in my mouth so bad all the time.
41:38
I, you know, I will finish my degree here, and I have hopes-
41:45
At Oregon State?
41:48
I hope to finish my degree at Oregon State, yes.
41:51
Both my baccalaureates and my Masters.
41:56
If I stay out here, it will be for only one reason.
42:01
And that is a problem solver.
42:03
I want to build a bridge
42:08
- solve the problems.
42:09
You know, build a bridge so that the future Native Americans that are
42:13
coming out here do not suffer the culture shock that those up to this
42:18
day have, and are still suffering.
42:21
That I'm suffering.
42:23
I want, I want them to be able to walk equally.
42:29
But I want the people out here to understand to that hey, you know,
42:34
you don't go out and catch a wild bird, and throw him in a cage!
42:37
And turn around and say "Now, you will tweet."
42:41
First off - the bird doesn't know what you're saying.
42:43
Second off, he's in such foreign surroundings
42:47
- you know, the shock - if he survives - you know, well, that's
42:52
one point plus in your favor!
42:54
Maybe.
42:58
If he survives angry that is not a point in your favor.
43:03
That means in time, there will be future trouble.
43:07
And you are starting to see some of these troubles, that you have created already.
43:14
In Wounded Knee,
43:18
when this happened here a few years ago, and at Alcatraz -I was on Alcatraz.
43:23
At the Nisqually fish-in.
43:26
Back in the 60' s. Actually, back in the 50's.
43:31
You're seeing it again right now.
43:33
At Big Mountain, amongst the Diné and the Hopi.
43:37
Diné - Navajo you know.
43:42
I do not understand why, even today, as advanced and educated as you claim to be
43:51
- and as, how do you say the word - Humanitarian - to all
43:57
these nations in the world
44:02
- that you deliberately come in and steal.
44:10
Blatantly, openly steal.
44:15
In the name of greed!
44:16
You know, more money.
44:20
Why -why - why rape the Earth so horribly?!
44:26
Where you gonna go after you get done finishing what you're
44:29
doing to this right now?
44:32
Okay.
44:33
Are there any more Plymouth Rocks?
44:34
No.
44:35
I think they're hoping for space.
44:38
Well the Indian is hoping that you will hurry up your Space Program.
44:41
Yeah - and get out of here!
44:42
Yeah - cause um, that and you guys get done playing cowboys and niggers!
44:46
We'll get my land back.
44:48
See?
44:49
But I don't know if we'd want it then!
44:51
Unless we get those big bull-dozers to go with us so we can push all
44:53
the garbage off into the water!
44:56
Because it's unreal - what is happening!
45:00
And that's, that's where I'm torn, because I'm torn between Earth Mother.
45:05
I'm torn, you know,
45:09
I have this small piece here that I live on.
45:13
Alright.
45:15
I'm nearly fifty years old!
45:19
And I have broke a Law.
45:24
Just so my family can survive, and has already been sanctioned,
45:30
so there's no problem.
45:32
But I can never sell this piece of ground!
45:37
How did you break the law?
45:38
By buying land?
45:40
I prostituted my Mother.
45:43
See
45:45
- I have to play the white game - called ownership - in order to survive
45:52
out here, and that's ironic.
45:56
I was surviving very well back then with my people.
46:01
But you took their land away!
46:04
And then you took everything else they had away.
46:07
And stripped em down to hollow, nameless Indians.
46:12
And then you buried 'em.
46:16
So now, I sit here.
46:17
But see, I cannot, I cannot go back and uh - I do not feel good about this, because we
46:25
never owned - we were here as caretakers!
46:28
Here to protect Mother.
46:31
As she in turn would care for us!
46:34
It was equal exchange.
46:37
Always!
46:37
[first recording ends] . And then White man came and he broke the Great Circle.
46:45
And since the Circle has been broken, there has been nothing but tragedy!
46:50
Wars - Famine - oh just...horrors beyond anything that can even be
46:57
imagined, I mean - total disregard for the Earth, and what it provides.
47:03
By the very chemical that they dump back into it, and then try to hide.
47:10
And then when they get caught
47:21
- they say "Who - me? No - he did it!" They do not even have the guts
47:23
to own up to their own thing, and then go back and solve the problem.
47:23
"NO - who me? No - he did it".
47:23
Pass the buck again.
47:27
Well anyway
47:33
- then I'm asked to come out here and trust.
47:35
You know, I'm asked to continue to trust - you're asking other Native Americans
47:39
to trust - my question to that would be
47:46
"Specifically what?" You know,
47:51
what am I supposed to trust?
47:53
I'm supposed to turn around and say "Oh, great, okay"
47:59
Then why - after sixteen years - when I have all the evidence available
48:07
- and I am still fighting with the Government
48:11
over injuries that I received when I worked for them.
48:14
It hap - now, where were you working and how did you receive your...?
48:18
I, well the work I was doing was classified.
48:21
I can't tell you too much about that.
48:23
Can tell you for the Department of Defense, and I worked for
48:23
the Dept. of Transportation.
48:26
The United Stated Government.
48:27
For the Navy, and the Coast Guard.
48:31
As a radar specialist and an electronics specialist.
48:35
I, my hearing is over 70% damaged, with secondary acoustic trauma.
48:41
That means I have severe tinnitus - and severe recruitment.
48:45
More or less I got a fire bell inside my head that will not turn off.
48:48
Hasn't turned off in sixteen years.
48:52
In sixteen years
48:56
I have fought and fought and fought to get help.
49:01
The government knew the help was available but has ignored it.
49:04
See?
49:04
Here we go again!
49:05
If you ignore it - it will go away.
49:08
I'm not gonna let 'em ignore it too much longer.
49:11
I'll tell you what I've been doing, but I'm,
49:14
will not let them get away with it much longer.
49:18
In fact, you'll probably be hearing about it nationally when I get done
49:21
with it - because I think that this is not only an insult to myself
49:26
but an insult to me as a tax-payer.
49:30
To take,
49:33
like in my case, born red - bring him out here -force him to be white,
49:39
work him like white, and then when he gets injured, play him black.
49:47
"Well, we used him up - throw him on a heap!" The object is that, you know,
49:55
the ears are gone - not the mind.
49:58
The mind is just as good, just as technical just as active,
50:04
but they have authorities.
50:08
People who are not disabled - sitting behind desks.
50:12
They cannot even begin to comprehend what we can or cannot do, making
50:16
the rules, saying "Well he can't do that!" How do they know?
50:21
Ute Indian- Woman's voice in background: I'm going to the store.
50:24
Do you need any - [break in recording]
50:24
. You know, how do they know?
50:24
You did not know I was deaf when you met me.
50:24
I didn't.
50:31
Alright,
50:37
now I have lectured at Universities all over this United States.
50:40
I've lectured before large crowds, up to 63,000 people.
50:47
I have taught for thirty-five years.
50:52
Sixteen of those have been deaf.
50:56
And still, most of my former students, to this day, do not
50:59
know that I could not hear them!
51:01
You taught for thirty-five years?
51:03
Yes.
51:03
Where did you teach at?
51:05
Out of motor homes and vehicles like these.
51:09
Because I wanted to go in and find out.
51:13
You know, it's so strange, [cough]
51:21
the sociologist, I call him an arm-chair sociologist - "arm-chair
51:27
anthropologist" and stuff like this, read a whole bunch of books, form
51:31
an opinion, and then write a book.
51:35
But how many of 'em go out and find out?
51:38
I mean, go there and stay there for any extended length of
51:41
time, and find out just how,
51:47
how good or how bad, or what is really happening.
51:52
How many will go among screw up, among screw up, among screw up, among screw
51:55
up and find out what is creating this.
51:59
Like why are people dropping out of this, or why, you know, why
52:03
is this change that's made nature change - this change in society?
52:09
I read a lot of things that turn around and say - they hypothesize,
52:15
on what they think may be the reason.
52:20
I can say it in one word: bullshit.
52:25
The people that are dropping out today, and in fact since the mid-
52:29
60's - or actually the mid-50's - are so tired of rhetorical bullshit
52:35
that they don't want it any more.
52:39
They're so tired of being,
52:42
having to perform like seals jumping through hoops to get papers,
52:47
which are called degrees, only to find out that they're useless.
52:51
And here's the ironic part of it... In my case, I'm gonna
52:54
be lucky - I have experience.
52:58
But, like you, you get a degree - where you gonna go to work?
53:04
Well I don't have any experience either.
53:05
Hopefully a newspaper.
53:07
No - I say I have experience!
53:09
Well, I don't!
53:10
So, it'll be hard for me too, I think.
53:12
Okay, so you go out there, and you wave this fancy piece of paper
53:16
[rustling sounds] And the first question they're gonna ask you is what?
53:20
Do I have any experience?
53:24
That's my point!
53:27
College paper!
53:29
Big deal, you know.
53:31
I've learned in a few classes, experience is more important to them than the degree.
53:35
Uh huh.
53:36
Yeah, but now - try to go out there and expound any word of authority!
53:42
To be heard - and the first thing they're gonna turn around and say "Well what
53:45
qualifies you to make this statement?
53:49
Where are your credentials?" Life is my credential!
53:54
But I found out that, you see, that's not acceptable.
53:59
That is not acceptable - it's not acceptable that I've
54:02
traveled around the world twice.
54:03
The first time I hitchhiked!
54:05
Singing folk music, and exchanging folk music, for folk music.
54:15
Ah - but see, that is of no value.
54:19
You know, uh - where can they write this down.
54:24
So - well, this'll satisfy this part of the degree.
54:29
So - invariable, it is useless to the academic world.
54:32
Because the academic world is not flexible enough, to take an
54:38
individual, or individuals, that have been further than their back yard.
54:45
That have seen more than say, a great many of the professors
54:48
which they're studying under,
54:52
and have offered to share it.
54:54
I've got to the point where I don't even share it anymore.
54:56
And you feel really frustrated that professors at colleges?
55:02
Ah, not all.
55:03
Some.
55:05
Others turn around and say "Yes, I can understand," but I have
55:10
to fight with the bureaucracy.
55:11
Here we go again, here's this authoritative nucleus that turns
55:16
around and, you know, dictates the element, and they haven't even
55:21
been out of their back yard yet.
55:24
You know.
55:26
How do they know what I had see?!
55:29
I have documentation of everywhere I've been and everything I've seen.
55:34
I have log books,
55:38
but you see, they're not suitable criteria for uh, individuals
55:46
quote, professors, for acceptable
55:52
usage.
55:53
So what they do is, they turn around and say well you must go through this
55:55
mundane experience...to their satisfaction
56:04
so that you can get a little letter on a little piece of paper
56:07
saying "Well you did fair, you did good, or you did excellent." Huh?
56:11
And then that follows you through the rest of your life!
56:13
More or less, He was good in humanities, or he blew Humanities.
56:18
You mean, the only Humanities on Earth are in a book?
56:24
I'll give you a good, good, good - a breakdown of this.
56:32
I have a massive technical background!
56:35
Massive technical background.
56:37
I've been turned down for jobs because I'm overqualified!
56:44
And at three different universities, I will not say what three, and
56:53
it was pretty close to home,
56:58
they have turned around and said
57:02
- here I got all these years working in technical fields -in electronics
57:07
and mechanics and a combination of the both - they turn around and
57:13
say "Oh, we can't accept that."
57:17
Where did you learn this?
57:19
I taught myself, from the very books that you use in school and from
57:24
experience - by doing, by doing.
57:28
You can't learn to hitchhike around the world by book.
57:31
I could write a book on it.
57:33
But it'd be obsolete before it hit the press.
57:36
It was obsolete before I even got back.
57:39
Because what's happening in this world since then - you wouldn't
57:42
want to hitchhike around it!
57:44
See back then, it was very nice.
57:46
But anyway - here they turn around and say "Well, we can't accept your technical
57:50
background, uhm, you're gonna have to pay $400 to take the exams - or - you're
57:56
gonna have to take the courses." You mean an individual that was sixteen years a
58:00
professional in the field of electronics, that had to pass Civil Services exam
58:11
- must go back and take basic electronics to satisfy what is supposedly to
58:17
be a place of "higher education"?
58:24
I mean this, this, this - I mean, look at the futility of it!
58:27
They said to themselves that they're the Gods of the Authorities and yet they
58:34
send the students out there and they can't get a job after they get their
58:37
degree 'cause they got no experience?
58:39
And you come in there with experience and they turn around
58:43
and say "Well, it's not important."
58:48
Is this higher education?
58:49
KM: The places you went to, did you apply at more places before
58:54
you - you found out from them that you had to have a degree, right?
58:58
To work?
58:59
No.
59:00
No?
59:00
No, No.
59:02
I worked for years, and years before-
59:05
Then why did you want to go to the University?
59:06
I'm being retrained because of the injury.
59:09
Into a totally different field.
59:11
More or less I'm going through my second professional occupation in life.
59:13
And that's Journalism?
59:15
Well, communications.
59:17
No Journalism's just a small part of it.
59:19
Very, very small part of it.
59:22
No, I'm interested into, specific media for educational purposes.
59:28
Visual, for hearing impaired.
59:32
I'm looking at three-dimensional teaching devices for those that can't
59:37
hear, but can see - and vice-versa, those that can't see, but hear.
59:41
So that they can physically touch.
59:43
I'm looking for new teaching aids.
59:46
But I'm also looking at another element that is totally untouched, and that it
59:49
is, how do you bring this individual through that form of shock, where
59:56
they - you know, I've lost my wife!
59:59
You know, my home, everything!
1:00:02
After this injury.
1:00:04
It took a Congressional action to even get compensated, and that
1:00:11
was three years after the injury!
1:00:12
And three years - if I hadn't been brought up by Great-Grandfather,
1:00:19
I probably would have been robbing banks!
1:00:22
To survive.
1:00:23
No, I went to the woods.
1:00:25
And I lived in those woods.
1:00:28
I went from commune to commune, to commune, to commune to
1:00:31
organization etcetera, and I'm the historian of two of 'em.
1:00:36
Two of the most well-known, in fact the one that started the total communal
1:00:41
treck - Morning Star, which was down at Sonoma county in California.
1:00:45
Where's the other?
1:00:46
Huh?
1:00:47
What's the other one called?
1:00:48
Wheeler's.
1:00:49
The Ahimsa Church.
1:00:50
Where's that?
1:00:51
That's also in Sonoma County.
1:00:54
One is between Occidental and Graton.
1:00:56
That's Morningstar.
1:00:56
And then the other one is between Graton and uh, what's the name
1:01:02
of the place out on the coast?
1:01:04
Bodega Bay.
1:01:06
It's up on Sheep Ridge.
1:01:09
Lou Gottleib over at Morningstar and gave that to God and Bill Wheeler
1:01:16
owned Wheeler's, which was also known as Ahimsa Church, or Open-Land Church.
1:01:23
And then, in total violation, again, of your loans and your religions - Lou
1:01:33
Gottleib gave his land to God.
1:01:35
State of California turned around and said "well to God under existing California
1:01:38
laws, cannot own land because He's neither real nor artificial, so help you God".
1:01:42
You want to see?
1:01:43
I have it in there.
1:01:44
I have a complete Morningstar case sitting in there.
1:01:45
I'm doing a book on it, called Some Called It Sacred.
1:01:50
Alrighty,
1:01:53
what's that tell you about your religion?
1:01:58
If God is neither real or artificial
1:02:04
- then why in the Hell have they put, you know, such precious people - human
1:02:10
beings - through assorted forms of physical Hell, mental Hell, in
1:02:17
the name of that same individual?
1:02:22
And yet, your laws specifically forbid making such a ruling.
1:02:28
The Federal laws - no law - no Court in this land shall rule of what is, or what
1:02:32
is not a church, what is not divine, or what is or what is not a religion.
1:02:38
And yet, the state of California, and the Superior Court - the
1:02:42
Appellate Court in the state of California - upheld this ruling!
1:02:46
Not so much am I arguing with the element of the land - but what they said.
1:02:54
Now you ask me to go into Court and swear on the Bible?
1:02:57
How do I explain it to the Judge?
1:02:58
"Well, you Honor, I can't do that! Cause California's already
1:03:01
ruled that God doesn't exist! He's neither real nor artificial!"
1:03:07
What year was that?
1:03:08
When did that happen?
1:03:09
That happened in 1972.
1:03:12
1971! Yeah, I have the papers in there.
1:03:18
Yeah, Judge Eiman - of California of Sonoma County - down in Santa Rosa.
1:03:26
I was there when he made that ruling!
1:03:30
I was there to see honor hobbled down again when, in California, it
1:03:34
is mandatory to take judicial notice of English terms and phrases, more or
1:03:38
less the Judge must turn around and interpret the English terms and phrases,
1:03:42
or define - and the Judge blatantly sat right there and told us, when Lou
1:03:48
Gottleib asked the Judge to take judicial notice of the word God - the Judge
1:03:52
turned around and said "Mr. Gottleib,
1:03:57
I refuse to take judicial notice of that term. And I refuse to take judicial
1:03:58
notice of anything else that you ask." This is a flagrant abuse of the laws-
1:04:04
mandatory laws in the State of California.
1:04:10
Now you sit down and you talk about equal protection under the Law!
1:04:17
There's only equal protection if you can afford it!
1:04:21
You're lucky - don't ever work for the Government.
1:04:25
Work for a private firm.
1:04:27
That way, they're a private business.
1:04:29
That way, there if you do get injured, you have help.
1:04:34
The people like me that work for the Government
1:04:38
- there is no help!
1:04:42
Unless we make it public!
1:04:43
Which I intend to do.
1:04:46
Do you think that's just for Indians?
1:04:48
From the Government.
1:04:49
Or for everyone?
1:04:49
Everyone - I don't care who it is.
1:04:51
I don't care who it is.
1:04:51
I think my case it, I do find points of discrimination which are very flagrant
1:04:57
in the case, and which I can prove, but see, no attorney will touch it!
1:05:03
You have to get permission to sue the Government.
1:05:07
Isn't that cute?
1:05:08
They can injure you - but you have to get permission to sue them!
1:05:13
I've spent tens of thousands of dollars pointing out
1:05:18
- legally - the errors in my case.
1:05:22
Which to this day still have not been corrected.
1:05:28
And had to do it at my own expense.
1:05:36
And they - the only thing that I can get from them is "Well we just
1:05:39
have a difference of opinion." You mean, a shortage of $12,000 in
1:05:42
compensation is a difference of opinion?
1:05:46
You got that twelve - when did you get that $12,000?
1:05:48
I got that last April.
1:05:51
That was after sixteen years of finding out that it was missing.
1:05:55
And now we've turned up that there's another $4-6,000 that we know of, readily.
1:06:02
Right now know of, can prove.
1:06:04
And possibly another $30,000
1:06:08
that we have to dig further into.
1:06:13
They arbitrarily turned around and said uh, loss of wage earner capacity
1:06:18
- that means what other job could you do, so we can rate your compensation.
1:06:22
So they turned around and said arbitrarily, went down the book and
1:06:24
selected "Well he can be a guard - and they made recommendations for a guard".
1:06:24
Federal guard must have perfect hearing and vision!
1:06:24
And they turned around and said "Well he can be a
1:06:36
guard".
1:06:37
So they stand on that.
1:06:38
This has been pointed out to 'em time and time again.
1:06:43
So they just arbitrarily said "Well he can be a guard".
1:06:45
That's it!
1:06:46
That's after your accident?
1:06:48
After the accident.
1:06:49
After the injury.
1:06:50
So, I can go to work as a guard.
1:06:53
Now let's put it this way - now would you hire me?
1:06:56
For a guard?
1:06:57
Yeah.
1:06:58
Say if you had a multi-million dollar business.
1:07:02
Not without hearing.
1:07:06
Oh, well the Government says I can do it!
1:07:13
Now who's right?
1:07:13
You or the Government?
1:07:15
Well if I'm the one hiring, then I am.
1:07:17
But if-
1:07:18
But - you explain that to the government!
1:07:22
But the guy can't hear!
1:07:25
He reads lips.
1:07:26
What's he gonna do after dark?
1:07:28
Huh?
1:07:29
Read lips in the dark?
1:07:31
You know, I said that analogy goes like this: it's like asking a blind
1:07:35
person to "view" a silent movie.
1:07:39
And do a book report on it.
1:07:42
It makes about as much it's that ludicrous!
1:07:49
I have severe recruitment.
1:07:50
That means I can't even get around a firearm.
1:07:52
Because if it goes off - if you're anywhere near the area - you're in more
1:07:56
danger than the person, the perpetrator.
1:08:00
Because when a firearm goes off, I have a total involuntary response to noise
1:08:08
- which I have hurt a lot of people already.
1:08:10
Just working there.
1:08:12
When somebody made a loud bang, or something like that.
1:08:16
Okay.
1:08:16
It is excruciating!
1:08:18
The pain is so excruciating you can't believe it.
1:08:20
It's all the way to the bone marrow.
1:08:22
You said when the phone goes off yesterday, that's it's
1:08:25
like an explosion in your head.
1:08:25
You hear telephone ring - I hear an explosion.
1:08:28
What do you hear when I'm - the 30% of you that can hear, me?
1:08:32
Yeah.
1:08:32
What do you hear?
1:08:33
I hear parts of words.
1:08:35
And see, in the context of the conversation, when you're
1:08:38
speaking, the words I can see I can form a sentence mentally
1:08:43
of what you're saying.
1:08:44
Now, I'm about 90% right.
1:08:47
Every once in a while, we'll be talking, and all of a sudden I find
1:08:53
I've missed a word or something.
1:08:55
Or missed an idea.
1:08:57
See, I have to run a theater up here all the time.
1:09:03
And I have to, you know, you're a good looking lady - let's face it
1:09:08
-and I'm not staring at you because you're good looking, you know, I'd
1:09:10
rather stare otherwise, but the thing is - I have to see what you're saying!
1:09:15
Alright, I do hear sound - that's does not mean I hear speech.
1:09:21
See?
1:09:21
People think deafness is, a person cannot hear.
1:09:24
Everything is quiet.
1:09:27
No.
1:09:27
There are a great many forms of deafness!
1:09:30
Mine is one of the worst.
1:09:33
Mine is a noisy deafness.
1:09:36
I have a ring in my head that is as loud as a fire bell!
1:09:40
Right around a 105 DB in both ears that I cannot turn off.
1:09:48
I have not slept a full night in sixteen years.
1:09:54
Right now, I sleep on average maybe from a half hour to an hour-and-a-half
1:09:59
a night, and the rest of the time is, you know, sit up and listen to the ring.
1:10:04
Okay.
1:10:04
Do you take naps during the day?
1:10:05
Huh?
1:10:06
Do you ever take naps?
1:10:07
I took one just before you came in, but I didn't take a nap.
1:10:09
I just laid there, because I am so exhausted - from mentally compensating
1:10:16
for the ring that uh, you know, I'm physically being torn down by it.
1:10:24
It's a living form of hell.
1:10:27
Alright, you have that with recruitment - and nearly a 70%
1:10:31
loss of the ability to hear, a ring louder - let me give you an example.
1:10:38
A ring louder that
1:10:48
this [cranks up loud radio].
1:10:51
I hear something, I'm not sure what it is, cause the ring is still louder than that.
1:10:56
That was even giving me a headache.
1:11:00
That loud.
1:11:04
You ever hear a microphone feedback?
1:11:06
Yeah.
1:11:07
Alright...picture that sound!
1:11:09
Remember that sound.
1:11:12
And not be able to turn it off.
1:11:15
Well, that is what tinnitus is!
1:11:18
It is debilitating as hell, but the Government doesn't recognize it.
1:11:22
"Oh he got a little ring in his head -you know, that ain't gonna hurt him."
1:11:25
Tomorrow you're going up to the Health Science Center in Portland?
1:11:27
Yes I am.
1:11:29
What have they found, you said they've been researching it for years?
1:11:33
The Government has known about the research and everything else, uhm, yeah.
1:11:36
They have found a way to, hopefully, in most tinnitus cases, to "mask" the sound,
1:11:41
by adding "white noise" to, at the same amplitude as the ring is, so that is
1:11:48
cancels out the ring, and then the hearing aid will allow voice to come through.
1:11:54
They are concerned in my case that the ring is so loud, that it is at
1:12:00
the point of, of - okay - eighty-five to ninety DB when you start having,
1:12:08
when you start- that's the danger level, for ear da - hearing damage.
1:12:13
Mine's at 105 decibels and they're gonna try and "mask"
1:12:15
that noise at 105 decibel, no.
1:12:18
That would totally deafen me.
1:12:20
And then all I'd be left with is the ring!
1:12:25
Okay.
1:12:27
So, they were trying to find - I don't know exactly for sure
1:12:30
what all they're gonna do.
1:12:32
I just hope they don't do any more tests like Dr. Conkee just did!
1:12:37
Cause uhm, since that test of two weeks, I have barely slept.
1:12:41
Where's that at?
1:12:42
Up there?
1:12:42
Hildebrandt.
1:12:43
A clinic.
1:12:44
Now he didn't do it intentionally to be evil or anything else.
1:12:47
He wanted to find out something.
1:12:50
Well - he found out!
1:12:53
I have had little or NO sleep in two weeks, 'cause the rings in
1:12:58
the ears are ringing ferociously.
1:13:01
They are slowly settling down, but you know, normally after three
1:13:07
or four days they'll settle down.
1:13:09
What kind of test was it?
1:13:11
They had a white noise test, to match the tinnitus, to find
1:13:15
out loud the tinnitus was.
1:13:16
Here it's 105 decibel and stopped.
1:13:21
Cause I could still hear the ring.
1:13:22
And the noise he was feeding me was excruciating pain!
1:13:27
See - my pain threshold, in hearing, is between seventy and eighty decibels.
1:13:36
My speech threshold is at seventy and eighty decibels.
1:13:44
So, uh, it's, you know, you're dammed if you do and you're dammed if you don't!
1:13:51
Anyway, it's going-
1:13:54
Okay, oh,
1:13:57
I wanted you to talk about your shops here.
1:14:01
Oh, okay.
1:14:02
This is part of what I believe I believe, and believe strongly
1:14:10
that I'm here to be a teacher.
1:14:13
Whether anybody hires me or not.
1:14:15
I have taught for thirty-five years without pay.
1:14:19
And without support!
1:14:23
I'm, right now, you're sitting in what will eventually be a one
1:14:27
part of a two piece mobile unit.
1:14:30
That will be designed, as you can see, I'm building it - benches
1:14:35
and everything else - to teach
1:14:40
woodworking, metal working, crafts, sculpturing, auto mechanics,
1:14:45
the whole shooting match.
1:14:46
The benches are in the shop will hold the basic materials.
1:14:52
The most of it will be done outside this vehicle.
1:14:55
All the equipment rolls out, and we go to work out there.
1:14:58
Will teach em how to build solar equipment, how to build steam
1:15:01
engines - anything that they want.
1:15:03
And we don't charge!
1:15:05
We haven't charged.
1:15:08
Not in all the time that I've had it.
1:15:10
Had the idea.
1:15:14
This is the seventeenth unit or system that I've built to take on the road, and
1:15:22
it's now - what has priority are this.
1:15:27
Rural communities, people that are, you know, to the point of destitution, very
1:15:32
poor, etc. have first call on this,
1:15:37
education has second call on this, and anything left over after that,
1:15:44
I don't care what the price is that they offer - has last call.
1:15:49
Because they are not doing anything now to help those individuals out there.
1:15:56
Then why should they have this there to gawk at, when it could be out there
1:16:00
doing the work it was designed to do!
1:16:02
It
1:16:05
is designed specifically for people, with the idea of helping them
1:16:09
help to become self-sufficient!
1:16:12
More or less, it's a training aid on wheels.
1:16:16
This part here, the shop, which is about thirty feet long, will contain,
1:16:22
well it teaches everything from silk screening, sculpturing, batiking,
1:16:25
anything in the area of arts and crafts.
1:16:28
I'm certified through the state of California.
1:16:30
Do you ever try and work with the arts and crafts from your - from your background?
1:16:34
From when you were a child or that you-
1:16:37
I still do it today.
1:16:38
I sculpture - that's how I've been supporting this insanity on wheels, as the
1:16:43
bonsai sculptures that I do are bronze.
1:16:47
I hand extrude bronze with a torch and make miniature trees that
1:16:51
look like living bonsai trees.
1:16:54
Only difference is, you don't have to water these.
1:16:56
Okay, and they're just as fragile.
1:16:57
The root work and everything else.
1:17:00
And I sell those, you know, just to get fuel and needs
1:17:04
going up and down the highway.
1:17:05
The rest of it is handled by donations on-the-spot.
1:17:09
You might get maybe two dollars in donations for the whole days' work,
1:17:12
or you might get fifty dollars in donations for the whole day's work.
1:17:15
It all goes back into this, and then the little bit of compensation that I get,
1:17:20
a small part of that goes into this.
1:17:23
More or less, I cannot ask those individuals that are out there, that are
1:17:27
in so much trouble now to turn around and say "Pay $500 a day to bring this
1:17:34
thing" to them - because that's what it costs, to turn the key on, these two
1:17:37
vehicles on and move them down the road!
1:17:40
Nearly $500 a day.
1:17:43
I'll bet the gas mileage is horrible!
1:17:45
No, they're not really that bad, not for the size vehicles
1:17:48
and the weight they carry.
1:17:49
This one here carries 18,000,
1:17:53
that one over there carries 22,000 pounds.
1:17:55
Actual
1:17:58
- that's actual weight.
1:18:00
Uh, and they average between eight and a half and nine miles to the gallon.
1:18:06
Now the thing is, how much gas would it take to bring all those people here?
1:18:12
What kind of expense would be involved for all those people to come here?
1:18:17
When it, when a local area or locale - I can bring it
1:18:22
there, and they can come there.
1:18:26
What makes more sense?
1:18:29
Take people that are in Roseburg and make em drive all the way up here?
1:18:33
In that small of a state and not - and do this here?
1:18:36
Or take this to different areas in this state - and teach.
1:18:43
Is that where you plan to use this one?
1:18:44
In Oregon, or-
1:18:45
This one, this, the other chariots that I had, in fact the most famous
1:18:50
one, the Solar Chariot, uh, which is no longer with us, we wore it out.
1:18:55
571,000 miles.
1:18:57
Okay.
1:19:00
Traveled coast to coast, forty-seven round trips.
1:19:03
That's round trips.
1:19:04
The hard way, sig-zag across the United States.
1:19:07
Teaching.
1:19:08
[cough]
1:19:15
Teaching.
1:19:16
Teaching at areas that you've only read about in books!
1:19:20
Or only heard about back in the Appalachian.
1:19:23
Back in the Pennsylvania gold country.
1:19:26
The Smokies,
1:19:28
the Adirondacks, up in the Upper Rockies.
1:19:33
Uh, Sierra Nevadas.
1:19:39
Near my home, all through - up and down through Oklahoma, Missouri, the Ozarks.
1:19:44
Areas like this, into Reservations that
1:19:50
I would dare say that the very person requesting this here would
1:19:53
never even be welcome to enter.
1:19:55
There are areas in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas,
1:20:01
Tennessee & Kentucky, that I can readily go into, and not get shot.
1:20:07
I'm talking about "shiners".
1:20:08
The Government has threatened many a time to arrest m if I didn't
1:20:12
divulge where I was getting the fuels for the Solar Chariot.
1:20:15
And I've turned around and said "It took me thirty years to gain that trust,
1:20:19
and I'll be dammed if I'm gonna, you know, divulge it to you. So that you can
1:20:25
go in and hurt some of those people".
1:20:28
You said - do you make your own alcohol, to-
1:20:29
Oh yes.
1:20:30
Alcohol's simple.
1:20:31
You know, any good country boy can make, tell ya make a
1:20:33
little bit of "shine" Really!
1:20:35
If you can distill water, honey, you can make the alcohol.
1:20:39
I mean, well it's a little bit more involved, let's put it this way.
1:20:42
You gotta get your mash started.
1:20:44
But mash is just another way of forming you know, another form of yogurt.
1:20:48
Do you make it here?
1:20:49
No, no, no, no.
1:20:50
No, no, no, no, we will not discuss where I make it.
1:20:54
Just in case this goes the wrong direction, because there are some twits
1:21:00
out there that are so interested in a couple of bucks, that they would be so
1:21:05
vindictive as to go ahead and use a piece of paper like this, and turn around and
1:21:08
say "Let's get that SOB, man. I want a couple of bucks. Let's turn him in!" Well
1:21:13
- they're in for a real royal surprise.
1:21:16
I have an experimental fuels permit!
1:21:17
Good.
1:21:19
Yeah - Really!
1:21:20
Uh, so, if they want to play that kind of game, that's great!
1:21:25
The thing is, is that I do not make ALL of my own fuel, but I'll be damned
1:21:29
if I'm going to turn around and tell them where in the hell I get it!
1:21:35
Because, you know, the - let's fact it - the Chariot and I
1:21:35
both agree on the same fuel!
1:21:38
And the frequently our argument is whose gonna get the last squeeze!
1:21:41
[chuckles] And the Chariot usually wins!
1:21:43
What percent alcohol is it?
1:21:45
We run 140 to 160 proof.
1:21:48
Now, bushel of corn'll make two and a half gallons of high proof.
1:21:51
That's about 190-
1:21:58
[female voice interrupts] Take the message!
1:22:04
You know, its 140 - 160 proof.
1:22:06
A bushel of corn'll make High Proof.
1:22:08
Two and a half gallons.
1:22:10
You do not dare run 190 proof in a car, cause it's too hot.
1:22:14
See?
1:22:15
So, what you do is add water to the alcohol!
1:22:17
And you get more fuel.
1:22:19
More for you to, huh?
1:22:20
Well - get it watered down, you know, the, the, the proof of the
1:22:26
stuff that goes into vehicles is equivalent to, you know, 151 rum.
1:22:31
Okay?
1:22:32
And you could light a match and it'll burn!
1:22:35
And burn beautifully, you know, if fact, well Wild Turkey'll burn.
1:22:40
But this makes such beautiful flame, you know.
1:22:43
And thing that is beautiful about alcohol fuel in vehicles like this is
1:22:49
that lot of people "Hey, you know, I can't run alcohol in my car".
1:22:51
You can run it in any car that's running around right now, you know, that's
1:22:55
internal combustion gasoline, by enlarging the main jet in the carburetor 40%,
1:23:00
because alcohol's heavier than gasoline.
1:23:04
Not bad - Okay.
1:23:06
So, and the other thing too is, it burns cooler and cleaner!
1:23:13
And the one thing that is does above all is that, it dissolves carbon.
1:23:21
The Chariot, when we finally sent it to Inspiration Point, you
1:23:26
could have taken the head off and eaten off the inside of the head.
1:23:31
There was not an ounce of carbon to be found anywhere in the engine!
1:23:36
We did 250,000 miles just on moonshine.
1:23:41
Then the rest we've done on assorted other fuels, we ran a little while on
1:23:44
methane, ran a little while on pre-heated diesel to gasoline, kerosene, any time
1:23:53
we ran on kerosene, people back in the hills would turn out and you know,
1:23:57
dump their lanterns into the tank.
1:23:59
And we had a variable adjustment on the carburetor, on the main junction
1:24:03
so we can run different fuels.
1:24:05
And the carburetor's no stranger.
1:24:07
It was made during the Second World War.
1:24:08
It's called a Zenith.
1:24:10
In fact, I still have the carburetor.
1:24:12
I took that off the Chariot before we sent it to Inspiration Point.
1:24:15
Will you use it on this one?
1:24:17
I don't know - I may take that carburetor, in case that it's a rather
1:24:27
interesting little carburetor, it's a multi-fuel carburetor, and see,
1:24:32
we, unfortunately during the Second World War we had a tank division shot
1:24:36
to hell because it ran out of gas.
1:24:40
And the advent of that particular incident, this carburetor showed up.
1:24:45
It was made by the Bendix Corporation and it was called a Zenith.
1:24:48
And it started showing up on not only farm vehicles, but on military
1:24:53
vehicles, and the adaption of that still exists today on all military vehicles
1:24:59
that are designed for over-seas use.
1:25:03
To run on kerosene, alcohol, gasoline.
1:25:06
Is it still on farming equipment?
1:25:06
Oh yeah.
1:25:06
You can still find it.
1:25:09
There are two adjustments on the carburetor.
1:25:11
One is for the main valve, the other one is for the air-fuel mixture.
1:25:15
Or main jet.
1:25:15
You
1:25:18
know, it's no big deal, it's just interesting to have.
1:25:22
You
1:25:26
were referring, when you had your accident that you lost your wife because of it?
1:25:32
Yes.
1:25:34
I lost my home, everything!
1:25:36
Virtually everything I owned.
1:25:38
Because of the molasses state of this government, in getting anything done.
1:25:49
Most of it was just you know, hurry up and wait!
1:25:52
Procrastination.
1:25:54
I had no way to support the family or pay the bills, or anything else.
1:25:58
I was totally out work.
1:26:00
I couldn't get unemployment because the case was in litigation
1:26:03
with the government for claim.
1:26:06
I couldn't get welfare.
1:26:07
I couldn't get anything!
1:26:09
So - uh, what do you do?
1:26:13
You know?
1:26:15
You sit there and uh, fight off the bill collectors, and
1:26:18
uh, and give the wife promises.
1:26:23
You can't eat promises.
1:26:25
Was
1:26:30
you wife a Native American?
1:26:30
Huh?
1:26:30
No.
1:26:32
Not her.
1:26:36
She was my second wife, and uh,
1:26:42
it hurt awful, awful, awful deeply to uh, have to separate that.
1:26:48
My first wife died.
1:26:50
Two doctors made a mistake, they turned around and said "Well," she
1:26:54
was pregnant, and they turned around and said "Well, she's pregnant.
1:27:00
There's things that pregnant women have" stuff like that.
1:27:02
Gastric problems.
1:27:04
Turned out to be terminal cancer, so I lost her and the baby both!
1:27:08
And uh, they turned around and kinda "Well, what could we say,
1:27:12
you know? They fooled us too!"
1:27:19
I wish to hell they could a gone to the funeral!
1:27:21
You
1:27:23
couldn't go to the funeral?
1:27:24
I wish they could have.
1:27:26
See?
1:27:29
So - that's, that was,
1:27:34
other than the Government schools nothin would'a matched what
1:27:38
happened at the Government schools!
1:27:39
And the orphanages.
1:27:40
I think that was, and the injury - I think uh, that was probably one of the hardest
1:27:47
things I've ever suffered in my life!
1:27:50
Even to this day, you know.
1:27:52
It's just uh-
1:27:54
You don't have any children?
1:27:55
No.
1:27:56
No children, uh, I
1:28:01
created two, neither one survived.
1:28:05
And uh, I guess it's as Great-Grandfather says - the,
1:28:12
this family, the Eskiyadokas, will end here.
1:28:19
In fact, he prayed to die.
1:28:22
That's how deeply hurt he was!
1:28:25
And as it looks right now, the children you see, coming up here right now, are
1:28:32
my wife's children, from another man, he is also Native American, and a total
1:28:39
[whistles] I mean, he totally flipped out.
1:28:43
And I can understand, you know, to a certain amount, but I cannot
1:28:47
understand his total de-voidance of ever wanting to get around his children.
1:28:53
So, that's not us
1:29:00
- they are so precious!
1:29:01
You know.
1:29:02
I mean, I'm a mid-wife.
1:29:06
I have delivered fifty-five children.
1:29:09
And there's no secret about it - that in news article after news article,
1:29:13
I've been in court several times over it, and my only question to the
1:29:16
doctor is that, you know, I was not practicing medicine without a license.
1:29:21
My only question to you is "Where were you when she was having the baby?"
1:29:26
The last one I delivered was right here is Oregon.
1:29:28
At White Horse Meadows, down is Southern Oregon.
1:29:31
Yeah.
1:29:32
I would say twenty-five miles walk from anyone of any authority.
1:29:40
And I caught my ration of hell for that one.
1:29:43
So - I have my other business now, and am staying out of it.
1:29:46
I figure fifty-five children, they're all living - no complications - no
1:29:52
problems - I do not push the luck.
1:29:55
Okay.
1:29:56
'Cause I don't think I could handle it
1:30:00
this time.
1:30:00
You know, I'm
1:30:02
internally afraid.
1:30:04
Very very
1:30:11
afraid.
1:30:13
So, love the hell up [laughs] . They're so much fun.
1:30:17
How many are here?
1:30:20
Two.
1:30:20
Two?
1:30:20
Yeah.
1:30:20
My daughters now are Danni and Sabrina.
1:30:26
But anyway, you know, like I said, I think you know, I
1:30:32
think the Eskiyadokas end here.
1:30:35
I don't want it that way, but I am so confused about, you know, should
1:30:43
another child have to go through
1:30:48
what I've gone through?
1:30:51
I think that would be an insult to the Great Spirit.
1:30:55
I actually
1:30:58
think that would be an insult.
1:30:59
I think I would rather wait, and let them find a new world.
1:31:06
I'm gonna do what I can about changing this one, but
1:31:12
uh - until then, I don't know.
1:31:15
It's just - you know -try and look forward - try to look optimistically
1:31:20
and try not to,
1:31:25
uh,
1:31:28
remember back, [unclear] still goes on today, which is the greatest
1:31:34
tragedy goin' on right now.
1:31:37
Down in Arizona, in Four Corners, One of the most disgusting too, because it's
1:31:42
not only political, but it's religious.
1:31:45
They are moving over 10,000 people - forcibly removing them from their lands.
1:31:49
The Navajo, the Hopi.
1:31:50
The Navajo Dene.
1:31:51
And relocating 'em!
1:31:56
I mean, the culture shock alone of that!
1:31:58
Cause those are traditional lands.
1:32:00
Those are sacred lands.
1:32:02
Their medicine is there.
1:32:03
It grows, you know.
1:32:04
And they want to throw those people off their land.
1:32:06
And you get -here's another thing - where the government's come
1:32:10
in and set up a council, 'cause we have to have a government you know!
1:32:13
Like your government - which doesn't even exist anywhere, in any form
1:32:18
of our, you know in 25,000 years.
1:32:19
It doesn't even exist.
1:32:21
And even in our thought, and they go vote as to whether we move the people or not.
1:32:30
Now your way of voting is, is those that abstain go with the positive vote.
1:32:36
The Indian way is, is we abstain, that answer is no, 'cause we have not made a
1:32:44
decision yet we are still working on it.
1:32:46
So, what they did is, they set up a little cute vote down there,
1:32:52
with the Traditionals, not the Traditionals but the oh, what we call
1:32:56
the apples [?] the elected council, this government only recognizes, they
1:33:02
do not recognize the non-nucleated
1:33:07
Government in which the Native American has -and then, there
1:33:11
were three votes yes, and one no.
1:33:13
There were only four people voting, so they turned around
1:33:16
and said the three yes's will speak for the rest of the people!
1:33:20
The people don't even recognize the rest of the Council.
1:33:23
But the government's turning around and saying, "Well, we're only going
1:33:25
to recognize the Council." And
1:33:28
again - see, this is in violation of your own laws.
1:33:32
Okay, so here you got this mess going on - What they want the land
1:33:38
for is, so they can strip mine 'em.
1:33:40
It's got coal on it.
1:33:41
Well this is the land they put 'em on, and let 'em stay on, 'cause
1:33:45
it's sacred, back then - and it wasn't of any use to the white man.
1:33:48
This was the Dakotas?
1:33:49
Well the Dakotas - the Dakotas are coming up very shortly.
1:33:52
After you know, this one here, after Big Mountain, I think'll be
1:33:56
pretty much a shoot-'em-up war.
1:33:59
Very, very similar to Wounded Knee, except I think it's gonna be a lot more vicious!
1:34:04
And then - Wounded Knee is gonna crank up again!
1:34:08
I
