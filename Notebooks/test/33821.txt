00:05
This recording was made in Corvallis on August 13, 1991.
00:13
The interviewer is Judith Berlowitz.
00:17
The interviewee is Molly Goheen, Mrs. Harry Goheen.
00:36
When did you and your family come to Corvallis?
00:39
We came in the fall of
00:43
1955, just in time for public school to start, so our
00:46
children would be here in time.
00:49
What brought you here?
00:51
Obviously my husband's job, which was a professor in the mathematics department.
00:57
Did you have a career at that time?
01:00
I had worked, but I was here just a short time and a woman whose
01:05
name was Goheen came to visit us,
01:10
and we went out for lunch and she asked me how I liked Corvallis, and I said I liked
01:15
Corvallis, I had wonderful neighbors, but all we did is have coffee in the
01:18
morning and have tea in the afternoon and I was getting a little bored with that.
01:22
And my youngest child was in nursery school, I mean kindergarten, so I
01:28
got a phone call from the public library asking me if I'd like to
01:30
come work part time, so I did.
01:33
Did you have a degree in
01:35
. . . No I don't, I have a degree in education, I was a teacher.
01:38
Oh, I see.
01:42
Where did you come from?
01:43
Seattle, but we lived all over the United States.
01:46
I was born in Seattle, my husband in Bellingham, and we met in college.
01:51
I see.
01:52
And he had various jobs before you came here of course.
01:56
Who were the members of your immediate family at that time,
02:00
in 1955 when you came here?
02:03
The ones who came with us?
02:04
Well it was my husband Harry, and my oldest son David, and Mitzi, whose
02:10
name is really Miriam, and Mark.
02:15
How old were they?
02:16
David was 15, Mitzi was 13, and Mark was 5.
02:23
What would you say was the approximate population of
02:26
Corvallis when you came here?
02:28
Well I imagine it was around 30,000, counting the students, but I'm not sure.
02:34
So it really hasn't changed in numbers so terribly much between then
02:40
and now.
02:41
Well I think there are about 45,000 now.
02:41
Well that is a considerable change.
02:44
How many Jewish families would you say were here in '55 when you came, roughly?
02:49
Well it would have to be roughly, because some of them didn't
02:53
identify as Jewish, but I'd imagine not more than 10 if that many.
03:01
Would you say they represented diverse approaches to Judaism, that is
03:06
. . . Oh definitely.
03:08
Definitely.
03:09
What would you say your approach was, as a family?
03:13
Well my
03:16
husband decided early on that our children were going to be called Jewish,
03:20
though he isn't Jewish, wasn't Jewish.
03:23
And so they went to,
03:28
he decided they should have a Jewish education.
03:31
So I think our family's approach was cultural rather than anything else.
03:38
We did celebrate things like Hanukkah, and we had a Seder, and taught our
03:44
children the bible stories, and we identified as Jews always, the
03:52
children as well as Harry and I.
03:54
How did you feel about being part of such a small minority in relation
04:00
to the rest of the community?
04:01
Well you see most of my life I lived in a small town when I was a girl, there were
04:05
only about five Jewish families, and then I went to school and lived in a dorm where
04:10
there were no other Jewish people, so I didn't even think about it, really, except
04:16
that I would have liked to have a Sunday school for my children or something, so
04:20
they would learn something about Judaism.
04:23
How did the children feel being among a small number of Jewish kids here?
04:30
I should really have Mark -- well I'll tell you about Mark's bar mitzvah
04:34
later -- Mark decided to have a bar mitzvah, and his speech, which I think
04:38
he has, was on what it means to be a Jewish boy in a non-Jewish community.
04:44
I think that would tell you more than anything what it was like.
04:47
But I didn't have any feeling one way or the other.
04:50
You can tell us the gist of what Mark had to say.
04:53
Well he just said that most of his friends just ignored it, they were one religion
04:58
he was another, and it wasn't until he had a teacher who was anti-Semitic that
05:02
he got interested in having a bar mitzvah.
05:05
He decided that he was going to show that teacher he was really Jewish.
05:08
Although his teacher was never mean to him or
05:12
. . . Could you tell a little bit more about that particular
05:16
situation with the teacher?
05:18
You don't need to mention any names.
05:20
But how did this become evident to him and so on.
05:26
Well he just, he never did tell us exactly what the teacher said, he just would
05:31
come home, he was only in about the sixth grade, and he would come home and say, "My
05:38
teacher's really anti-Semitic." We'd say, "How do you know?" "Well he says things."
05:42
He's a he?
05:42
The teacher?
05:42
The teacher was a he, yes.
05:42
And so
05:48
Mark -- he knew Mark was Jewish, Mark told him he was Jewish, and
05:51
he never discriminated against him.
05:53
And one day he came home and said, "My teacher isn't anti-Semitic, he said some
05:58
of his best friends were Jews," and we all laughed and it hurt his feelings.
06:02
And Ruth Goldberg at the time had a book called, "Some of My Best Friends are
06:05
Jews," so she gave it to him to read.
06:07
And he decided he wanted to have a bar mitzvah.
06:10
We decided that was kind of silly because we didn't belong to a
06:13
congregation, but Ze'ev heard about it and he said, "If he wants a bar
06:16
mitzvah, he'll have one." So we did.
06:21
So that's Mark's story, but my next question would be did you and your husband
06:26
sense any prejudice against Jewish people?
06:29
Not really.
06:30
Not among our friends.
06:33
Or any time during your life here?
06:35
No, not really.
06:37
Did you find the non-Jewish people at all knowledgeable about Judaism?
06:42
No.
06:43
Completely non-knowledgeable.
06:45
They asked questions about, "Is Hanukkah the Jewish Christmas?"
06:49
and they didn't really know.
06:51
Well some of our good friends did, obviously, but many people were
06:55
really ignorant about Judaism.
06:59
Were you or your husband ever asked to speak about Judaism to
07:03
any groups or anything like that?
07:05
Well I had people come and interview me, students, at my work,
07:09
when I worked at the university.
07:11
In the library?
07:12
In the library, yes.
07:16
In connection with their
07:18
. . . Well they had papers to write.
07:22
Ok, well you've already mentioned, I think, something about holiday
07:27
celebrations, but I was going to ask what holiday celebrations
07:32
you celebrated at home.
07:34
You did mention you had a Seder.
07:36
Well we had a Seder with the Orzechs and other people, and
07:39
the Schecters, and sometimes it was here, and sometimes it was at
07:44
Orzechs'.
07:46
And we celebrated, we lit the Hanukkah candles.
07:49
But I'm afraid that's about what we did.
07:54
Where did you go for the high holidays, since I know they
07:57
were not celebrated here.
07:58
No.
07:59
Well we went only once to a high, a Rosh Shoshanna service, and that was in Salem.
08:08
And we were invited there by a student of mine who was Jewish who lived
08:12
in Salem, and the family invited
08:20
us.
08:20
I understand that in 1957, 10 Jewish families in the
08:26
community had a Hanukkah party.
08:28
Were you part of that?
08:29
Oh yes.
08:29
Tell me about it.
08:30
I can't remember exactly -- it's all kind of in together.
08:34
But we had a Hanukkah party for the
08:38
. . . we had a Purim party here one time, we had about 30 people, and they were not
08:44
all identified as Jews, although some of them, one member of the family was Jewish.
08:50
We also had something, well it was before we moved in here, so it must
08:55
have been in about '58, Harry decided that it would be nice to have all
08:59
the Jewish people we knew over and they asked him to give a book review.
09:03
So it was Hanukkah, so he reviewed Howard Fast's "My Glorious Brothers."
09:08
And there were a lot of people there.
09:09
Even the Malamuds came, and the Levines.
09:13
And people who didn't really identify.
09:16
Not that they were trying to hide their Jewishness, it was just that
09:21
they just didn't seem to be involved.
09:28
Let's go back to that Purim party you mentioned a little while ago
09:34
that was held here at your house.
09:35
What were some of the activities you did to celebrate?
09:39
Well, people brought hamantaschen and we had good food, but the most
09:44
fun was the telling of the story of Esther, and we had noisemakers
09:50
and other loud things, and everyone booed every time Haman was mentioned.
09:54
It was all adults, it wasn't a children's party!
09:57
And it was, I think, fun, I think people had fun, I know I did.
10:10
Let's go back to Mark's bar mitzvah.
10:13
You mentioned that
10:18
the situation in school stimulated -- that's not the good word -- caused him
10:24
to want to go through the bar mitzvah ceremony, so let's talk about it -- how
10:30
it was conducted and who was there and all of the elements that relate to that.
10:37
Well I should start earlier, when he learned earlier, so
10:40
he would have a background.
10:42
When Mark was about 10, there were four children who were good friends, their
10:47
families were good friends, and two were Jewish families and two weren't.
10:50
We tried to get someone to teach the children French or German, and we
10:54
couldn't really find anyone, so Ze'ev said, "I'll teach them Hebrew." Well all
10:58
four were interested, but I think Mark and David Katz, who was the other Jewish
11:03
boy, were the only ones who kept on.
11:05
Then when Ze'ev got too busy, he found an Israeli student to teach them Hebrew.
11:10
So Mark actually knew enough Hebrew by the time he was bar mitzvah
11:14
age to be part of the ceremony.
11:19
Well then
11:22
he decided he wanted this bar mitzvah, and Ze'ev said that we could do this.
11:27
So I went to Portland and talked to one rabbi and he was not a bit
11:30
interested, he said that we didn't belong to a synagogue and he wasn't
11:35
going to have anything to do with it.
11:36
Then we went to Rabbi Rose, I think it was, at the reform, and he said "Fine,"
11:40
and he lent us a torah and prayer books.
11:43
And Ze'ev conducted the whole thing.
11:46
It was at the Unitarian Fellowship, the women in the Unitarian Fellowship helped
11:51
us very much, they helped with the food.
11:53
We brought the food, my mother and my sisters from Seattle brought food, and
11:58
people from Portland . . . we knew a lot of people in Portland at that time.
12:05
There was a lot of food, there were about 75 people at the bar mitzvah and
12:08
about a third of them were Jews and the rest of them were our friends here.
12:14
Quite a few of our relatives came from out of town.
12:19
It was I think a very successful . . . Ze'ev conducted the service, my son
12:24
David came up from California and he was part of the service, and Larry
12:30
Schecter helped too, and I can't remember all of them, cause a lot
12:34
of the people were from Portland.
12:36
And we had a big feast afterwards.
12:39
I think it was a very nice ceremony.
12:43
I think it was the first bar mitzvah in
12:45
. . . It was, I read that fact, that it was the first one that was conducted here.
12:52
Well I should tell you how we met all these people in Portland.
12:58
We had some friends who moved here from California, Bob and Rose Sabaroff, and
13:02
they became very good friends of a lot people in town, the Schecters and the
13:06
Orzechs, and they were particularly good friends of ours, and they got
13:11
acquainted with some people at the Jewish Community Center in Portland.
13:15
The Jewish Community Center conducted what they called an egghead weekend every
13:19
year at the coast, and they had a speaker,
13:24
and then there was a lot of fun too, but we had discussion groups and we had
13:28
plays, and we met a whole group of very interesting people from Portland that way.
13:34
And they're still our friends, these people.
13:37
The first year we were there, the president of Portland State talked.
13:41
It didn't have to be a Jewish subject, in fact it rarely was.
13:44
He talked about the street cries of London, which was his specialty.
13:47
One year Harry talked about his specialty and one year Ze'ev talked
13:50
about his specialty in economics.
13:52
And we went up as long as they kept them going.
13:56
They were discontinued after a while, but we met a whole
13:59
group of interesting people.
14:03
A little while ago you mentioned something about wanting Sunday
14:10
school experience for your kids.
14:14
What kind of efforts were made in that direction to establish some
14:19
kind of training for the kids, in the years before there actually was
14:23
. . . Well there was -- my son Mark came home one day when he was in about
14:28
the second grade, and he said he was the only child in his room
14:32
that didn't go to Sunday school.
14:33
Well we had a very good friend who was the superintendent of the Unitarian
14:37
Sunday school, so he said, "I'll take Mark." So Mark went there for about
14:42
two years, and we had a carpool with the Malamud children, we took turns
14:47
taking the children, and then when he was old enough, he went by himself, and
14:50
then he decided he wasn't interested anymore so he just quit going.
14:54
But about that, well it wasn't till a few years later that
14:57
we started the Sunday school.
15:01
We being
15:02
. . . Well the Schecters
15:04
the Orzechs and the Loneys and the Konicks . . . a do-it-ourselves Sunday
15:10
school, and we had it in people's homes.
15:13
And we had it by age group.
15:15
There were about three people Mark's age and then there were younger ones.
15:19
By that time my older two children were in college.
15:23
I see.
15:23
Did all the kids meet at the same place, the same home, wherever that was?
15:28
No, no they didn't.
15:30
The younger ones met one place.
15:32
I think Larry Schecter had Mark's age at his house.
15:36
Yes.
15:36
It was really very nice.
15:38
How did you manage books and other material?
15:41
We bought books.
15:44
I didn't have anything to do with the older ones, but they had
15:47
books, and they had bible stories.
15:50
Did they do crafts too sometimes?
15:52
Well the little ones I think did.
15:53
The older ones didn't.
15:56
But they learned about the holidays.
16:00
So we're still in the years before Hadassah.
16:05
OK.
16:06
I understand that there was a Jewish organization, I should say an organization
16:13
for Jewish students, on campus.
16:15
What can you tell me about that?
16:19
Well Hillel here was run by Joe Ellison, who was a history
16:22
professor, and it was his baby.
16:25
He didn't want outside interference, he didn't want the Jewish professors
16:31
involved, and he kept it pretty much to himself, so I can't tell you too
16:35
much about it until after he left.
16:38
I see.
16:38
So that was back in the '40s, I think I read.
16:42
I think I read that it was established in '46.
16:45
Well I'm sure it was here before we got here.
16:47
So what happened after he left, and about when was that?
16:53
Well it was about,
16:56
I can't remember exactly, dates all run together for me.
17:02
Late '50s perhaps?
17:03
Yes I think the late '50s.
17:04
It was after we got here.
17:06
So then what?
17:08
They had a Hillel and I can't remember who the
17:13
advisor was, but it think it grew.
17:16
And the professors got more involved.
17:20
The other Jewish people in town got more involved.
17:22
Yes that was my question.
17:24
How did Jewish families in the community interact with the students?
17:29
Well, most Jewish families in the community except for the Konicks
17:34
and the Loneys and the Goldbergs were part of the university.
17:38
And there were very few Jewish professors on campus when we came.
17:45
Even in the math dept, which was very unusual.
17:48
Usually there are quite a few Jewish people in the math dept., there were none.
17:53
There was another professor who was married to a Jewish woman, and
17:56
she was laughing, she said, "We're infiltrating." But there were very
18:01
few Jewish people before the 1950s.
18:04
I mean Jewish faculty.
18:06
In
18:08
fact there were very few Jewish people in town.
18:12
So when did that begin to change?
18:14
Well about the time we came.
18:18
About that time, Ze'ev and Larry came -- Ze'ev came right after we did, I think
18:23
Larry came at the same time we did.
18:26
And then there were other Jewish professors, more and more.
18:29
Was there any particular reasons for this increase in
18:32
the number of Jewish professors?
18:33
No, it's just that . . I think the reason for the dearth was gone.
18:39
I think Kerr was the one who kept the Jewish people out.
18:41
Oh I think we haven't mentioned him.
18:43
Kerr
18:44
. . . Kerr is the one the library was named for.
18:46
Now I'm telling you this
18:47
. . What was his position on campus?
18:49
He was president!
18:52
Strand was not anti-Semitic.
18:54
He was
18:56
president when we came.
19:00
Now I'm just telling you this
19:04
-- Sally Friedman, the Friedmans were here -- well I heard it from her.
19:11
And actually her husband came here because at one time they made a shift in which
19:17
departments were with the university [of Oregon] and which were at Oregon State,
19:21
and her husband was sent here because the chemistry department, the science
19:26
and the engineering were here, and
19:30
the liberal arts were there, and he came with the group that came
19:35
from the University of Oregon.
19:39
He was a very well loved professor I guess.
19:41
He died the year before we came here but everyone liked him.
19:45
Often mentioned in what I read about the Jewish community here are the
19:52
13 ladies who were the movers and shakers of this small community.
19:57
You were one of those ladies.
19:59
Now can you tell me anything about how this group evolved, and what
20:04
activities they organized as time went on and there were more of them?
20:09
Well we wanted to have -- the Jewish women, and the men I suppose -- wanted
20:14
to have a Jewish organization, and so we looked into the Council
20:20
of Jewish Women and Hadassah.
20:22
Now my family were never Zionists.
20:25
My mother never belonged to Hadassah, she belonged to the Council of Jewish Women.
20:29
The Council of Jewish Women turned us down because what they do is more like a
20:33
settlement, a group helping poor Jewish people, and there weren't any here.
20:40
I mean everybody was not rich but well off.
20:45
So it was decided we would have Hadassah.
20:47
I didn't really want to join Hadassah but my husband talked me
20:50
into it because he felt I should belong to a Jewish organization.
20:53
I felt so too, and these were all my good friends.
20:57
And I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it very much.
21:00
And I think Mimi was the first president.
21:02
And I was the president in 1967, because that was the year we went to Ireland and
21:10
I told them I could only be here half a year, and they said that was all right.
21:15
So what was the main reason for wanting to belong to a national organization?
21:23
Well because we were doing things hit and miss, sometimes we'd have
21:27
a Seder, sometimes we wouldn't have a Seder, sometimes we'd celebrate
21:30
Hanukah, sometimes we wouldn’t.
21:31
We wanted to have a group that was cohesive and would do
21:35
things in a more organized way.
21:37
And then you could have regular meetings and all that kind of thing.
21:40
Yes, we had speakers.
21:41
And it was a very good group.
21:44
In the days before you were organized, was the Jewish community
21:51
visited by representatives from national Jewish organizations
21:55
or from Jewish congregations?
21:58
Not really.
21:59
Not that I know of.
22:00
They may have been, but I didn't know anything about them.
22:03
I think that people who wanted to belong to something went to Salem.
22:12
I read somewhere that at one time, the 10 Jewish families that lived
22:18
here, or I should say 10 Jewish families that lived here, got together
22:22
and had a latke party for Hanukah.
22:25
What do you remember about that?
22:28
Well I remember that it was at Bob and Rose Sabaroff's house
22:32
and the men did the cooking.
22:34
I don't know if they did the grating of the potatoes, I think they
22:37
may have got them from somebody.
22:38
But he had an indoor grill, and they cooked them, and
22:45
it was really a lot of fun.
22:47
People came that, well Jewish people I think sort of crawled out the woodwork,
22:52
people who . . . but it was really fun.
22:55
It was really not organized at all, except for the food.
22:58
But it was just a very ____________ [sounds like "ga-meet-lish"] crowd.
23:02
How did the Jewish people who crawled out of the woodwork find out about this thing?
23:07
Well they were told.
23:11
They were invited.
23:14
A lot of the Jewish people, when we first came here, a lot of the Jewish
23:17
people, especially mixed marriages, were active in the Unitarian Fellowship.
23:24
But when they found someplace to belong to, they were willing and
23:31
able -- not able but willing -- to become part of the group.
23:41
I can name some names, but that's kind of silly.
23:43
Not at all!
23:44
It's history.
23:44
Well, the Krakauers, the Malamuds, I'm trying to
23:50
think
23:50
. . That is the author you're speaking about?
23:53
I read his book about his life in Corvallis.
23:56
Yes.
23:57
I
23:59
can't remember all of them, but they were part of the Unitarian Fellowship,
24:04
because it was someplace for them to go, it was like a club, really, because
24:07
they didn't have a minister or anything, it was just a fellowship, and they had
24:11
speakers and everything, and some of the children went to the Sunday school.
24:18
But when there was something to go to -- and the Levines, Shep and Gloria
24:24
Levine, were not active in anything Jewish, but they came to these things.
24:28
They came to the one at our house where the book review was,
24:30
they came to the latke party.
24:33
And I can't remember all the people who came.
24:35
I think Nina and Bill Lowry came.
24:42
I can't remember.
24:44
Her mother was Jewish , her mother belonged to Hadassah subsequently.
24:49
Bill was not.
24:51
And I can't remember all the people.
24:53
Maybe Mimi or Larry may be able to.
24:57
The three men, Bob Sabaroff and Larry Schecter and Ze'ev,
25:00
I think were the cooks.
25:03
Well I'll ask about that when I meet with them.
25:08
Very interesting story.
