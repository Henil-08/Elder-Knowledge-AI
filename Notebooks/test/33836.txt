00:01
As a Jewish person who has lived here the longest, I think, having been born
00:07
here, you know more about the years preceding Hadassah than anybody else.
00:14
So let's start before you were born.
00:18
Tell me about your parents.
00:19
What were their names and where did they come from?
00:25
My father was William Konick.
00:28
He came to Corvallis in 1913.
00:32
He opened up a small jewelry store.
00:35
He had come from the east coast, Washington DC or
00:38
Philadelphia, in that area.
00:41
My mother grew up in Portland, although she was born in London, but
00:44
came to the United States as a baby.
00:48
They were married
00:51
1921,
00:54
and I came along in
01:02
1922.
01:03
Incidentally, my father was not the first Jewish person in Corvallis.
01:10
The Reicharts were already here.
01:13
I don't know how old their children were when they moved here.
01:19
Now Bob Reichart, I believe, is still alive, and he might be living with
01:26
his daughter, Muriel Wyatt, here.
01:32
He might.
01:35
I don't believe he kept his Jewish identity.
01:40
He would never come to any of the doings.
01:46
But they had four children, and I think that all four of their children
01:50
at least started at Oregon State University, which was Oregon State
01:57
College, I guess, at that time.
02:01
They had a small dry cleaning establishment at about 15th and Jefferson.
02:11
I think there was another family here, maybe a lawyer who might have come
02:15
before my father, but I never knew him.
02:20
Why did your father decide to settle here in Corvallis?
02:26
I don't know.
02:27
The story that we got, he had a brother in Seattle who was in the grocery
02:34
business, and he wanted to come out West.
02:37
Somebody recommended Philomath to him, but he liked the looks of
02:41
Corvallis better, so he settled here.
02:44
There were already four jewelry stores, and he made the fifth.
02:47
The awning that I see on 3rd Street, that is the same location?
02:55
No.
02:56
I
02:58
don't know where the first store is.
03:01
My sister-in-law has all the pictures also, so you might be
03:04
able to get something from her.
03:08
She
03:13
. . . I don't know where the first store was, it might have been across the street,
03:18
because he owned a little building there.
03:21
It might also have been on 2nd street, because at one time he owned
03:24
a small building there, but sold it.
03:30
It was right in that area.
03:33
What are your recollections -- this is a very broad question -- of
03:37
Corvallis during your early childhood, compared with the Corvallis of today?
03:44
I don't think you can compare it, really.
03:47
We lived on South 7th Street,
03:52
right across from where the Gazette Times is now, and there was a sorority
03:57
house across the street when I grew up.
03:59
We moved into the large house, I understand, when I was six months old.
04:03
Has that house sold since?
04:05
Yes, and it was remodeled in 1940.
04:08
And it was a nice neighborhood at that time.
04:14
My father could walk to work.
04:16
My mother, since she didn't drive, walked downtown to do her shopping,
04:21
and it was a very comfortable life.
04:27
Who were the members of your immediate family?
04:30
There was my mother, Sarah, and my father, and my brother, Alvin, and myself.
04:37
There were just the four of us.
04:40
And my mother's parents lived in Portland, and my father's mother
04:50
later came from Finland to Seattle.
04:56
What was your parents' approach to Judaism?
05:01
Were they very observant?
05:03
They always went to the synagogue for the high holy days.
05:09
Where was that?
05:12
First we used to go up to Portland with my mother's parents.
05:18
My father usually didn't go, because he didn't close the store.
05:23
Then later on,
05:27
when there was a synagogue in Salem, they went there, and were members.
05:32
In fact they were part of the group that helped start that synagogue.
05:38
For Passover we would have a Passover Seder, and many times my mother would ask
05:44
college students who couldn't go home, but we never had the Seder as such, it as
05:50
always a dinner and acknowledging that it was Passover, never reading the service.
06:04
So what kind of Jewish education did you and your brother have as young children?
06:13
Really none.
06:14
I remember that one year, though, that my mother sent away for bible lessons, so
06:18
we took bible lessons by correspondence.
06:21
I liked it, my brother didn't, I remember.
06:25
We were supposed to do them and send them in, and this went on for maybe a year.
06:29
And that's about all we had.
06:34
There was a contact with the family in Portland and Seattle, and I think
06:38
that's what kept the flame alive.
06:41
Incidentally, my mother came from a very orthodox family.
06:45
So
06:48
there was a lot of being at my grandparents' on Friday nights.
06:53
Was
06:56
there a Sunday school in the Salem congregation that
07:03
was in the works back then?
07:05
Not when I was growing up.
07:07
No, there wasn't even a shul there,
07:12
a building itself.
07:12
But
07:15
I do remember as a child, I must have been 10 or 12, when a B'nai
07:24
B'rith chapter was started, including Salem, Albany, and Eugene, and they
07:30
would meet at the different cities.
07:33
And this is how I met Rose Yaillen the first time.
07:39
Her family was an Albany family, and they were in the "ladies ready to wear" there.
07:45
Yes, and if I recall, she is one of the 13 ladies, one of the 13 charter members.
07:56
Yes.
08:02
I was just going to say that the synagogue came later, and I can't remember if it
08:06
was before the war or just after the war.
08:11
I know that my husband and I started going there as soon as we moved to Corvallis,
08:17
or as soon as it was available, if it was the case that it was not organized.
08:24
But it must have been built right after the war, because the buildings right after
08:31
the war didn't have the eaves, because they were conserving the timber and so on
08:38
and so forth, it just wasn't available.
08:42
You mentioned this one Jewish family that preceded the arrival of
08:49
your family -- oh let's talk about
08:54
. . . Well they just adopted my father, this family.
09:00
You know, he was single, and I think they helped him find a place to stay.
09:06
We were very close, she was almost like a grandmother to me.
09:11
They were older than my parents.
09:13
I remember when my brother had scarlet fever I went up there and stayed for three
09:17
weeks or a month so I wouldn't get it.
09:20
The two families were very close.
09:22
Are we talking about the Reicharts?
09:23
Yes.
09:24
I just wanted to be sure.
09:26
So were there other Jewish families moving here during your early childhood years?
09:33
I think we ought to put this into a time frame, a decade, that would be
09:38
. . OK.
09:39
Growing up, there were Jewish faculty here, and I don't know when they came.
09:44
There was Neil Friedman and his wife, and the Ellisons
09:50
. . . What decade are we in?
09:51
Just give us a general time frame.
09:53
Probably the 1930s, somewhere, because they were here when I
09:58
started college in 1940, and
10:03
I remember them having been here.
10:07
Now every once in a while, they would get together for an evening,
10:15
and I know that they would meet at our house or the Ellisons' or the
10:20
Friedmans.
10:20
Seems to me that there were a couple of other couples too.
10:25
There was a Jewish lawyer here,
10:29
but I don't remember him at all, and I don't know when he left.
10:37
So did you have Jewish playmates?
10:41
No, never.
10:48
Did you feel that you were part of a very small minority?
10:54
Did you have any feelings about that, with other children possibly
10:58
going to their churches and so forth?
11:01
Well I definitely knew that I was different, you know.
11:07
They all went to Sunday school and I didn't.
11:13
But we never talked about religion.
11:15
We just never talked about it.
11:17
You didn't have any really negative feelings about this,
11:21
or feeling a great lack because
11:23
. . . I think a lack, yes, and I'd notice this lack when I'd go to Portland and
11:29
be with my cousins, who, most of them were younger than I, but they were
11:36
all going to ______ ___________ or
11:42
some religious groups, and I had nothing.
11:47
Did
11:54
you ever experience, as a young child, any evidence of anti-Semitism?
12:03
Not as a child.
12:04
It wasn't until I graduated high school, and all the other girls were invited
12:11
for the rush weekend on campus, and my grades were just as good as theirs . . . I
12:18
think I felt it for the first time.
12:22
It wasn't an overt sort of thing?
12:23
No.
12:24
Well,
12:26
we got you to college awfully fast there.
12:29
I think we're going to have to backtrack a little bit.
12:32
Let's
12:35
-- tell me something about your school years, your elementary,
12:40
your adolescence and so on.
12:45
They were just like anybody's, growing up in a small town.
12:50
I was part of a group.
12:55
I never thought too much about my girlfriends being Jewish or not Jewish.
13:00
I knew that our home was different and they were always welcome at our house
13:05
and I was always welcome at theirs.
13:09
Did you find that your contemporaries knew very much about Judaism?
13:17
I don’t think that they knew anything.
13:19
And in fact, I was speaking to a friend that I grew up with, I must have met
13:25
her when I was five and she just moved into this complex about a year ago,
13:30
so we've been doing things together.
13:32
And we were talking about religion, and she said, "I always knew that you were
13:36
Jewish but we just never discussed it.
13:38
It was just . . . and we played together day in and day out with
13:43
the paper dolls and our dolls, but we just never talked about it.
13:50
Where did your husband grow up?
13:52
He grew up in Minnesota, in a small town.
13:57
How did you meet?
13:58
The USO in Seattle.
14:06
Was he always in the jewelry business?
14:08
No.
14:09
When I met him he was a journeyman electrician, and
14:17
after we were married and he had a job, and then -- I can't remember what happened
14:25
-- we had our first child, and my father needed somebody else in the store so he
14:30
asked Roy to come down and Roy accepted.
14:33
He was one of these people that had such wonderful hands, he could just do
14:40
anything, and he just fell right into it.
14:45
Let's backtrack a little bit and go to the high school years and the college years.
14:51
Tell me where you went to high school and major events there, and college.
14:57
I
14:59
went to high school, Corvallis High,
15:03
I think we were the second class to graduate from that building.
15:08
And after high school I went to Oregon State.
15:14
Majored in business and industry, I think was what my degree was in, with a minor in
15:23
art.
15:29
While I was in college, the war broke out, and of course Camp Adair
15:33
started, so there was all of a sudden this influx of Jewish fellows.
15:38
So we went to dances and all this type of thing.
15:43
And when I finished college, I went to Seattle to work,
15:52
and there I met my husband.
16:00
Back to Camp Adair for a moment.
16:03
I understand that in 1943, the Corvallis Jewish families hosted a Seder for
16:09
servicemen stationed at Camp Adair.
16:12
Were you a part of that?
16:13
Yes, I remember, very much against my will, because there was a dance
16:19
on that night that I wanted to go to, but I had to go the Seder.
16:27
I don't remember too much about it except that I remember my mother and Ruth
16:31
Goldberg bending over the stove to check the chicken and ladling out the soup, and
16:37
Rabbi, or Chaplain Kravitz, was there, who was the Jewish chaplain at Camp Adair.
16:45
Was this held at Camp Adair?
16:47
It was held at Camp Adair.
16:49
And I don't remember anything about getting the supplies out there or
16:53
where the matzos or anything came from.
16:55
I was still in college and just not at all interested, you know.
17:01
Can you remember approximately what size crowd this was as far as the servicemen?
17:06
I would say probably 50 to 75.
17:10
There were quite a few that had signed up to come.
17:14
I see.
17:16
Well.
17:17
Now let's get back to your career and meeting your husband and all of that.
17:27
Roy and I met at the USO in Seattle.
17:31
And we went together three months, announced our engagement, and got
17:34
married a month and a half later!
17:36
It was during the war, we were married seven days after V-J day, in
17:46
August, and then he got out of the service the following May.
17:52
And we had planned to move back to Minnesota, but changed our
17:55
minds, and stayed in Seattle.
18:00
And then as I said before, my father needed somebody in the store, and
18:05
so asked Roy to join the business.
18:09
Well of course the next chapters have to do with having children,
18:14
which is usually the next development in this sort of arrangement.
18:17
And I know that you had four children, but I don't
18:24
know any more than that, so you can fill in all the details about when
18:29
they arrived, and who they are.
18:33
Lewis Allan, whom we call Butch, arrived in 1947, in March.
18:40
He went through grade school and high school here -- is this what you want?
18:44
Sure!
18:47
Went to University of Oregon in Eugene.
18:52
He is a CPA,
18:55
and right now he is the head of the . . . do you want all this?
19:02
OK, the second child was also a boy, he was born here in Corvallis, and
19:11
he also graduated from the University of Oregon, and he is now living in Israel.
19:17
He has three children, the older boy has two.
19:20
Oh, and the second boy just adopted an Ethiopian baby, so another grandchild.
19:27
The third daughter is in Seattle, and she has her own business,
19:31
which is in Marine sales.
19:33
And
19:38
she isn't married.
19:40
And the younger one lives presently in Enterprise, Oregon,
19:44
and she has two children, and she is still going to school.
19:56
As married adults, did you and your husband feel a strong need for some kind
20:02
of formal congregation organization here?
20:06
Yes, I think we did, but you also have to remember that we were members of the Salem
20:11
synagogue, and that we took our children every Sunday to Sunday school for years.
20:17
When my brother's children got old enough to go, we would alternate Sundays.
20:22
So we would go with seven or eight kids in the car every
20:26
Sunday, or every other Sunday.
20:30
And we went there for all holidays, and so on.
20:34
I realize that there were a lot of Jewish people here who did not particularly
20:41
identify, so when I talk about the group, I'm talking about those people
20:49
who did identify and who became a part of the Jewish community of Corvallis,
20:57
and I wanted to ask, what activities were undertaken by this small group of
21:05
Jewish families a as group -- social, or otherwise, -- since there was no
21:12
. . . OK this is before Beit Am?
21:14
Yes, Also, before Hadassah, before there was any really formal organization.
21:19
OK.
21:20
As I had mentioned before, every once in a while somebody would have an
21:24
evening and have the Jewish group over.
21:26
There was also an active UJA drive every year.
21:35
You know, for the United Jewish Appeal.
21:38
Was there some representative of UJA from elsewhere who came?
21:42
Usually, yes, and then we would meet at somebody's home -- I remember sometimes
21:47
we would meet at my parents', sometimes the Goldbergs', and all this was before.
21:54
That was about as far as it went.
21:56
Socially, right after the war, Ruth Goldberg, Annie Reichart and myself,
22:03
Dolly Friedman and Gertrude Ellison started a sewing group, and you got that.
22:10
1947 I believe.
22:13
And
22:17
we would get together and sew clothing for babies and children, and we would take
22:23
them, I believe, to the Portland Hadassah, and they would send them on to Israel.
22:28
So we were very involved with Israel right from the first.
22:34
When Israel became a state in 1948, was there any special
22:39
celebration here to mark that?
22:41
No, we were all, you know, very happy, and I think -- no Roy and
22:46
I had moved down here by then.
22:51
So your children went to Sunday school and all their religious education
22:57
took place -- and I don't mean all of it, their formal education
23:00
-- Yes, until Hadassah started the Sunday school here.
23:03
Even though there were some efforts here
23:06
. . . And as I remember I think I was the first
23:11
chairman of that
23:15
Sunday school here,
23:19
when it was held in a little house
23:25
on Taylor Street.
23:30
I think that was the first one that we had.
23:34
And then later we had it at another house on 14th, and then we went to Westminster.
23:40
Are we talking at a time period after your children had been
23:44
through the Sunday schools in Salem?
23:49
My oldest son had already had his bar mitzvah.
23:55
I don't know if Dan had.
23:57
So did your children participate in this local
24:00
. . . The girls did.
24:01
And I
24:04
remember when Ze'ev started the little class for a few
24:12
children.
24:13
Hebrew class.
24:14
And both of our boys went.
24:16
Now that must have been about three years before Butch had his bar mitzvah.
24:22
He was born in 47, so I'd say about 57 or thereabouts, once a week at his
24:29
house, Ze'ev had Hebrew classes, and this was sort of the beginning of our
24:34
boys studying for their bar mitzvah.
24:38
Let's talk more about the bar mitzvahs of both of your sons.
24:48
You've just talked about Butch.
24:50
And that bar mitzvah was held
24:53
. . . In Salem.
24:54
And two
24:57
of our friends from Salem led the services, and Ed
25:04
Kogan from Albany instructed both of the boys to get them
25:10
ready for their bar mitzvahs.
25:12
And in both cases we had a luncheon afterwards, and
25:19
that was it.
25:21
It was just very much like the ones they are having in Corvallis now, except
25:28
that they had bimah and everything else.
25:33
But very much, a very homey type thing.
25:39
Records show that -- this is another subject -- 10 Jewish families got
25:45
together for a Hanukah party in 1957.
25:48
Does that ring a bell for you at all?
25:53
Can you tell me where it was?
25:55
No.
25:59
Well I remember one at the
26:07
Goheens'.
26:07
I can't tell you if it was in 1957 or not.
26:10
We had several of them in different years.
26:14
And I remember once we had them at Orzechs, I remember once we had
26:19
it at our place, and I remember we had it at the Gordon's one year.
26:24
So there were several years we had Hanukkah parties for the children.
26:28
And it was always fun and the kids did
26:32
enjoy it.
26:33
It seems to me we started before 1957, but I'm not sure.
26:41
That's just an event that I happened to see on a printed brochure.
26:46
Because I know that we had several of them.
26:49
And I also remember one year when our children were going to Sunday school
26:54
in Salem, that there was a prize for the best decorated house for Hanukah.
27:02
So we made mobiles, and we made a great big start and put real
27:08
tiny little red ornaments on every toothpick that stood out, there must
27:13
have been a couple hundred of them.
27:16
Anyway we won the prize.
27:18
Well was this contest
27:22
-- who participated in this contest?
27:24
People in Corvallis as well as
27:25
. . . Yes, anybody who sent their children to Sunday school in Salem.
27:30
I see.
27:30
And then there must have been judges who went around
27:34
. . . Yes, I think it was probably the head of the Sunday school or something like this.
27:41
But the kids enjoyed making the decorations, and we used
27:44
them for years afterwards.
27:47
What kind of congregation existed in Salem at that time when your children
27:57
were in Sunday school and so on?
28:03
It seems to me there must have been about a hundred families,
28:06
but I'm really not sure on this.
28:09
And most of them were businessmen.
28:14
It was very different from the group in Corvallis.
28:17
Yes, Corvallis is strange in that it never did have a group of Jewish businessmen.
28:24
Well speaking of the Jewish people in Corvallis, it seems that the
28:32
number of Jewish people here stayed about the same for a long period of
28:38
time, and then suddenly there was
28:42
a substantial increase.
28:45
When did those numbers increase, approximately?
28:51
Well I would say about 1952-1954.
28:57
When did the Orzechs come?
28:59
Do you remember, did they tell you?
29:02
Not exactly.
29:03
There was a family that moved here by the name of
29:08
Katz, Doris and I can't remember her husband's name right now.
29:15
They also had three children, and we were expecting our
29:18
fourth, just a few weeks apart.
29:21
And I met them through the
29:26
Orzechs.
29:27
Or I met the Orzechs, I guess, through them.
29:29
So they must have come before the Orzechs.
29:32
And they since have moved up to Seattle.
29:37
They were here just a short time, just a few years, and their last
29:41
child, Peter, was born here.
29:44
And that was kind of the beginning.
29:46
Of the influx?
29:47
Yeah.
29:49
What brought this about, this increase in the numbers?
29:56
Well the war was over and the young men had gone back to school, got their
30:02
teaching credentials, and got jobs in
30:07
Corvallis.
30:08
Cause the influx was definitely faculty, it
30:13
wasn't businessmen.
30:14
It was definitely faculty.
30:17
And then even for a while it kind of stayed the same.
30:20
And then
30:23
again, it began to sort of mushroom, and I am sometimes just amazed at
30:32
the progress that has been made.
30:36
So we have covered a good deal about some of those early years.
30:43
By the early 60s, though, there seems to have been a strong need
30:54
. . . [End of Side]
30:54
[Beginning of Side]
30:54
. . . with some national Jewish organization.
31:01
Why do you think this was?
31:08
Well most of us knew each other just through the Hanukah
31:12
party and things like this.
31:16
And Mimi was really the instigator, and invited somebody down from Hadassah,
31:21
and we became a Hadassah organization.
31:24
We needed 25 people, I remember, we only had 13, but they let us
31:29
become part of their group anyway.
31:32
And that was really the beginning of an organized Jewish community.
31:40
And it wasn't until several years later that we felt the men needed to be
31:47
included too, that Beit Am was started.
31:51
Yes.
31:52
Well Hadassah became established here in
32:01
1964.
32:01
My understanding is that it wasn't a typical Hadassah chapter.
32:07
No it wasn't.
32:09
Would you like to talk about that?
32:12
Well it wasn't typical in the sense that we couldn't donate large sums of money,
32:20
because we were most of us salaried.
32:28
I remember the first year we had to raise, I believe it was $350, and that
32:32
seemed like that an awesome amount to us.
32:36
So we were going to have this latke lunch, and the potatoes
32:40
came to us cooked and grated.
32:42
And I suppose you've heard all about that.
32:47
And then a couple years later we changed it to the blintz brunch, which
32:51
has been going right up until the end.
32:54
But we did pretty much what we wanted no matter what National said.
33:00
We were sort of a maverick group, I think.
33:03
But we almost had to be this way in order to survive.
33:09
In most Hadassah groups, each member is apportioned a certain amount
33:15
that they are responsible for the fundraising, because after all,
33:19
Hadassah is a fundraising organization.
33:22
But in our group we did it all together, and everybody was expected to turn out
33:26
on these couple of work days a year.
33:29
And I think
33:33
it became a very strong group because of that.
33:36
Because we all had a chance to work together and to know each other.
33:40
And I know that it was a very important part of my life, because after having no
33:47
Jewish friends at all, all of a sudden, in my forties, I had Jewish friends.
33:52
And it was a revelation!
33:55
I got in on all the holidays, the jokes, and a bit of Yiddish.
34:00
It was wonderful.
34:01
My parents did speak Yiddish at home, but only when they didn't want
34:05
us to know what they were talking about, so I didn't learn any of it.
34:15
Let's go back a minute to the war years.
34:18
As I understand it, the USO had to have somebody on their board from
34:24
the Catholic charities, from the Jewish and also from the Protestant.
34:29
And my mother was selected to represent the Jewish community.
34:35
So she was on the board of the USO during the war.
34:41
And there was this huge influx of Jewish men from all over United States.
34:51
This was a very busy time for her, besides helping my father in the store, because
34:56
with 90-some thousand men stationed just outside the town, business was booming.
35:05
But they offered classes at the USO in dancing, and also some artwork,
35:13
which I helped to teach occasionally.
35:14
Mostly I just showed up and was another student.
35:17
But
35:20
with my schoolwork, and I was in college at the time, it was a very
35:24
busy but very happy time for me.
