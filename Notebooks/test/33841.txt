00:06
This recording was made in Corvallis on August 7, 1991.
00:13
The interviewer is Judith Berlowitz.
00:17
The interviewee is Susan Philipp,
00:25
Mrs. Kurt Philipp.
00:54
OK.
00:56
When did you and your family come to Corvallis?
01:00
We came September
01:07
1962.
01:08
Oh, that's later than I suspected.
01:10
What brought you here?
01:12
Kurt was offered a job at the university in the history
01:17
department, and that's why we came.
01:21
Like that.
01:21
Where did you come from?
01:27
Immediately, we came from Germany, because Kurt was on a Fulbright
01:35
scholarship for a year, and he got the job while he was in Bonn.
01:43
And before that we were in Kansas and he had just finished with his coursework,
01:50
and we were looking for a job, we had two kids, so we decided we would come here.
01:55
Well that was my next question.
01:57
Who were the members of your immediate family at that time?
02:01
So there was Kurt and myself and Lillian and Michael.
02:08
How old were the children?
02:09
Mike was four and Lillian was two.
02:14
Let's get a little more background.
02:16
Where were you born?
02:18
I was born in Germany, and Kurt was also born in Germany.
02:24
But we both left when we were rather young.
02:27
I left when I was three years old, because our family was deported
02:35
to the camps in France, and Kurt left -- it was a fluke with him.
02:44
Every year his family sent him to Switzerland because he had asthma attacks.
02:48
And that year when he was supposed to return to them from Switzerland,
02:55
his parents had a chance to leave Germany.
02:58
It was, you know, the proverbial "last boat." That's what it was.
03:02
It was in 1938, and it was the last chance they had.
03:07
There wasn't enough time to get him back from Switzerland, so they took off for
03:12
Cuba, and they left him in Switzerland with a family during the entire war years.
03:16
I see.
03:18
How did you two meet?
03:19
Oh we met here in the US.
03:22
Because we arrived, Kurt was 17 when he came to New York, when his parents
03:30
finally came to the US, were finally able to get him over here, and my
03:37
sister and I came after the war.
03:39
And we were still children.
03:41
I was 12 years old when I came to the US.
03:45
Where were you and Kurt married?
03:47
In Denver.
03:49
And when was that?
03:52
1957.
03:54
So you weren't exactly a new bride when you came here.
03:59
No I wasn't a new bride.
04:02
We already had two kids.
04:04
That's right.
04:06
Five years later.
04:08
What would you say was the approximate population of Corvallis
04:13
when you came, do you remember?
04:15
Gosh no, I don't remember.
04:18
Oh, wait a minute.
04:19
No, I really don't, because we always talked about the population
04:24
at OSU and the population -- somehow we always kept them apart.
04:28
We just . . . it was certainly a lot less than it is now.
04:33
Corvallis was much smaller.
04:35
That's what I was going to ask.
04:36
The main difference between Corvallis of yesteryear back there and
04:40
. . . It was a lot smaller
04:43
Geographically as well as
04:44
. . . Geographically, yes, it didn't extend the way it does now.
04:48
It was much much smaller.
04:52
Approximately how many Jewish families were here at the time
04:55
when you arrived, roughly?
04:58
Roughly, I would say the ones that we knew about
05:04
-- there were about 13, 15 families tops.
05:09
Would you say that among them there were diverse approaches to Judaism?
05:16
Yes, very definitely.
05:19
Some very traditional and some not so?
05:21
We were the only ones who were traditional.
05:24
I don't remember anyone else at all.
05:27
Everyone else really was -- I don't think they would have come here otherwise.
05:33
I mean, I
05:35
really don't.
05:36
I think in those days, people, if you were, you tended to remain
05:41
where there were lots of other Jews.
05:44
But we didn't, we were the exception.
05:46
We came here even though . . . But when we got the job offer, and
05:56
this was all over the phone, you know,
06:00
Kurt asked about
06:04
. . . he was talking to George Carson, the head of the department at the time,
06:07
and he asked him, before he even asked what his salary was, "What is the
06:11
situation regarding Jewish life in Corvallis?" There was a long silence.
06:17
Because you know, George didn't expect anything like that.
06:21
And he says, "Well you know, I'll tell you, I really don't think there
06:23
is any. You'll have to find out." We called the rabbis in Portland to
06:29
find out, and indeed there wasn't.
06:31
But there was Portland not too far away, so we thought, we'll just take a chance.
06:35
We'll come here for a year.
06:37
And we'll see how it is.
06:40
But there really wasn't very much here at all.
06:43
So it's been 30 years, just about.
06:47
How did you feel being part of a very small minority here, being Jewish?
06:57
I don't think I gave it very much thought, to tell you the truth.
07:00
Because as
07:04
long as we were able to do what we wanted to do
07:07
. . . Religiously or
07:09
. . . Religiously.
07:09
I'm only talking religiously.
07:11
As long as we
07:14
-- and we were.
07:15
We were.
07:17
We really never had any problems.
07:20
It didn't really affect me very much.
07:22
It affected me to the extent that socially, we couldn't be as close
07:27
as we wanted to because we couldn't eat at anybody else's house.
07:35
But then once we explained, people did accommodate us, very well as a
07:40
matter of fact, but still . . . I
07:43
lacked a little bit in that area.
07:46
But it never bothered Kurt at all.
07:49
Because of observing the dietary laws.
07:51
Well
07:54
what was the most difficult adjustment you had to make to this community?
08:00
The most difficult adjustment?
08:02
I
08:08
really don't
08:14
think I had to make many.
08:15
If I had to, it wasn't a difficulty for me, let's put it that way.
08:19
I did adjust.
08:21
It wasn't really a difficulty, because the community, I felt,
08:26
made quite a few adjustment for me.
08:31
So it was a two-way.
08:35
I see.
08:35
Of course the children were young when they came here, but I was wondering
08:40
how they felt about being a minority,
08:46
such a small one.
08:47
Well once they started going to school, there certainly were -- problems came up.
08:54
I don't know if I'd call them problems or questions.
08:56
Especially since the teachers at that time had never run across Jewish kids.
09:03
Now there were some other Jewish kids, but because they weren't observant in
09:08
any way, they didn't stick out, they didn't have any problems, it was fine.
09:15
So in that sense, the teachers were very taken aback when I came
09:19
suddenly and I said, "My kid can't have this and this, and can we talk
09:23
about substituting certain foods, and
09:27
if you have to take a field trip, how about not on a
09:31
Saturday," or this kind of thing.
09:33
And I must say that the cooperation was absolutely tremendous.
09:37
And not only was it tremendous, the teachers learned a lot.
09:42
They took it as a learning experience.
09:45
So
09:49
we, even though we were pioneers in it, I think that it was a
09:54
very positive thing always.
09:58
And then the kids who came after our kids I think had an easier time because of it.
10:03
Because for the first time the teachers had an awareness
10:06
that there are other kids.
10:08
They told us they had never had that experience before.
10:11
Especially around Christmas time,
10:18
they never realized that kids may feel uncomfortable before that.
10:25
But I must say that we really cooperated, and it was a good experience.
10:30
Did the teachers use this new knowledge as a learning experience
10:36
for the children in their classes?
10:38
Exactly.
10:38
For the children in their classes.
10:38
They asked me to bring things, you know.
10:41
Of course we always thought of Hanukah.
10:42
Hanukah was the big thing because they right away associated it with
10:46
Christmas, so it was very easy.
10:48
And they certainly used it as a learning tool for the kids.
10:54
Did you and Kurt sense any prejudice against Jewish people?
11:00
No, we never did.
11:01
We never did.
11:02
And we never made any bones about it either.
11:05
Everyone knew exactly what we were and where they stood with us.
11:10
Did you find non-Jewish people at all knowledgeable about Judaism?
11:15
Not at all.
11:17
When we first came in, they knew practically nothing, nothing at all.
11:21
Did you and Kurt get asked to speak about Judaism?
11:26
Tell me about that.
11:27
Well I'm not very good at speaking to groups, so I left that to Kurt.
11:32
And he talked to just about every church, every school in the town.
11:37
At their behest?
11:39
At their behest, of course.
11:41
And he was asked very often.
11:43
I remember the first two or three years, oh maybe even longer, when there
11:49
wasn't a week that went by that he didn't talk to some group or another.
11:54
Also I might add, other groups in the town not connected with the
11:59
schools or churches -- civic groups.
12:02
He did.
12:03
And that was very good.
12:12
So you've already spoken about observing the dietary laws, and that requires
12:18
consumption of kosher meat, and I'm wondering how you managed that.
12:23
How did you get kosher meat in those days?
12:26
The kosher meat -- for a number of years we just ordered it either from
12:32
Los Angeles, and it was flown in by air freight, and then we also used to get meat
12:39
from Seattle, and it came the same way, either with a freezer truck and so on.
12:44
And we were the only -- there was one other family in Portland and us.
12:49
And we were the only ones, if you believe it or not, in the entire
12:51
Northwest, who ordered kosher meat.
12:54
So it was -- that aspect of it could be a little hairy.
13:00
But in later years what we've done, there are now something like 60 families
13:05
in Portland who order kosher meat, it's a co-op, so we have joined them.
13:12
And now there are generally in Corvallis maybe three or four families, and
13:19
the meat gets delivered by truck from Chicago into a huge parking lot in
13:27
front of the synagogue of Portland.
13:30
60 families arrive by car, if you can imagine.
13:34
Now in winter, it's really -- it can be pouring, and it's dark, it gets early
13:41
dark, and everybody will leave their lights on outside the cars, the beams, and
13:50
people are scurrying frantically, trying to find their particular meat order.
13:56
Nobody comes as far as we do.
13:58
We have two hours to drive, and one winter I remember Kurt was bringing
14:06
all the meat for the other people, at that time there were eight families,
14:09
and our car was absolutely loaded.
14:12
I didn't go with him because there wasn't enough room for someone else.
14:15
He had chickens on the roof of the car.
14:19
And it was the worst weather that we've ever had, and he was driving on I-5,
14:27
bringing it to Corvallis for all of us.
14:32
He was returning from Portland and in the middle he heard a big thump.
14:37
And there, the chickens that were on top of the car fell down in the
14:43
middle of I-5, cars scooting by like crazy . . . he stopped and he ran back
14:50
and picked up I think 20 packages, dodging traffic, rain pouring down.
14:56
He came back and said, "I don't think I'll ever do it again." Well he did it anyway,
15:00
but it was one of the worst trips we ever had, that was the only bad experience.
15:07
That's the meat business.
15:09
So
15:11
I know at that time there was not a
15:18
rabbi in this community, and I'm wondering who conducted weddings and funerals,
15:24
baby namings, bar and bat mitzvahs?
15:27
OK, the bar mitzvah that I remember, and there was -- no, I don't believe
15:33
there was any rabbi -- that was Ze'ev's oldest son, Danny, had his bar mitzvah.
15:42
And what we did was, by that time we had quite a few more people in the community,
15:51
we rented a room or arranged to have a room at OSU, and that's
15:56
where we had his bar mitzvah.
15:58
And it was a do-it-yourself thing.
16:01
Kurt did something, Ze'ev's father who came from Germany did part of the
16:06
service, and that's how it was done.
16:08
And most of the things that we did were conducted as a
16:13
do-it-yourself kind of thing.
16:15
We didn't have marriages that I can remember.
16:20
You know if anybody did get married, they went out of town or
16:26
they went to Eugene or Portland.
16:29
We had
16:33
brit milahs, you know.
16:34
Our son, our youngest, Howie, came, and the mohel came from Seattle,
16:40
that was the first time, the first bris we ever had in Corvallis.
16:44
The ceremony of circumcision.
16:46
Right.
16:49
What did you do about observing the high holidays?
16:52
Where did you go for those services.
16:53
Well we didn't have Beit Am of course, and there were not services, so we
16:58
went to Portland, because believe it or not, in Portland they needed Kurt,
17:04
because he knows how to read from the torah, and it's a specialized
17:11
thing, not everyone can do it.
17:13
And they needed somebody in Portland to do it.
17:15
So we've been going for the last 30 years, all the time, and
17:23
also, other families here went to Salem for many many years.
17:28
There are some who went to Eugene, but not as many as went to Salem.
17:32
I know for instance the Konicks went, and the Lannys, they did go.
17:37
All right, let's think back in the timeframe that we're talking
17:39
about here now, up to 1964.
17:44
Let's stay behind 1964.
17:46
OK.
17:47
At that time, were lesser holidays observed here?
17:54
Not at all.
17:56
As a matter of fact, when we first came, not even -- with the exception
18:01
of maybe two or three families -- no one knew about Rosh Hashanah or
18:05
Yom Kippur, which are, as you know
18:07
. . . In '62?
18:08
No.
18:09
Nobody knew about that, really they didn't.
18:11
With the exception of two or three families who did.
18:14
But otherwise no one was aware of it, because we didn't have a
18:17
community, there was nothing there.
18:23
We would know, well yes, we know this person is Jewish, but the only time we
18:28
really got together was if there was something going on at Hillel at OSU.
18:33
That was more the center than anything going on here in town.
18:40
Was that a going organization when you arrived?
18:44
When we arrived, Dr.
18:49
Ellison, who was in the history department, and who retired just before
18:52
Kurt [came] -- in fact Kurt took his position, he was the Hillel director.
18:57
And as a matter of fact, Kurt was asked to take his place to be the
19:01
new Hillel director, which he did.
19:07
But there weren't many students at that time either.
19:09
There were perhaps 10.
19:12
Tell me a little bit about Hillel, what its function is and so on.
19:17
Well, Hillel is the student organization, a national student
19:22
organization for Jewish students.
19:25
It's a focus for them to be for social, religious, cultural events.
19:31
That's what it is.
19:32
And
19:37
those were the kinds of events that were planned and carried on?
19:43
Yes.
19:43
Here, they mostly took the form of inviting speakers,
19:50
not for religious holidays or festivals at all.
19:53
It was strictly secular, cultural
19:57
. . . Did members of the Jewish community attend these various lectures?
20:01
They did.
20:01
They did, because it was the only thing that was going on at that time.
20:05
That was really when we met.
20:08
Did non- Jewish people attend these also?
20:10
Very few.
20:11
Some did but I don't even remember a non-Jewish person attending.
20:17
But we're talking of a very small group here.
20:19
We're talking if we got 15 people, we thought this was a great attendance.
20:31
I see.
20:31
I've heard a great deal about a group of 13 women, of whom you were one, who were
20:38
the movers and shakers of the small Jewish community that you've been describing.
20:43
So tell me how the ladies originally got together, what activities they organized.
20:52
OK.
20:54
Well we were all moms at home with very small children.
20:59
And our kids were pretty much of an age.
21:02
Mimi's kids played with our kids, and the Cavistons were
21:07
there, and they were all one age.
21:09
And there were about 20 kids all together.
21:14
And we became concerned that these kids were growing up without any
21:17
kind of Jewish education, and that's what we really thought of first.
21:24
Before we thought of any adult group, we were really concerned with the children.
21:31
Now the educational -- how
21:36
should I say -- the books, the educational material, the curriculum,
21:44
not even curriculum, but all the things that you need to educate kids
21:49
with, materials, were really not available the way they are today.
21:56
There was very very little available.
21:59
What there was available was available in the large cities, but not out west.
22:04
This was really far out.
22:08
And so finally we decided that perhaps what we should do was join a large
22:12
national organization, an organization that focused on education, and in this
22:20
way we could become educated and we could get the material for our kids.
22:26
And
22:36
this is what pushed us
22:40
to get together.
22:43
Excuse me one minute.
22:44
Were you meeting regularly as a group?
22:47
No, this was [casual] . I would talk to Mimi, we would talk to another one.
22:50
We were friends by that time and we got together fairly often.
22:54
We would meet at the
23:01
swimming pool, you know, our kids were taking lessons, and
23:07
on a very informal basis.
23:09
And then - how did we decide on Hadassah?
23:13
We decided on Hadassah because it was a national organization, it was
23:19
not a religious organization per se, it was something, an organization
23:25
that anybody would be comfortable with, and it also had a large amount
23:34
of educational material.
23:38
We did look into B'nai B'rith and other organizations.
23:41
We just thought this would be good because also, it had to do with
23:44
Israel, and some of us were interested in Israel at the time, although
23:47
none of us had been there yet.
23:49
But this seemed to be the right one.
23:51
Well B'nai B'rith is largely a men's organization, isn't it?
23:54
Well they also have women, ladies' B'nai B'rith.
23:58
It was mentioned but we thought, well, we will stick with that.
24:03
Now you asked about something else that I wanted to talk about, and I forgot
24:11
. . . I asked if you had regular meetings.
24:13
Once we got organized, the 13 -- we needed to be 15 women to be organized.
24:21
You fudged a little bit didn't you?
24:22
No, what we did was we took the telephone directory, believe it or not, and
24:27
we started looking up Jewish names.
24:31
We found a couple of Jewish doctors in town.
24:35
We started calling people, not only the Jewish doctors but anybody whose name
24:40
sounded Jewish, and letting them know.
24:42
And it was one of the worst jobs, I'll tell you, that I have ever done.
24:46
And I have done a lot of things for Hadassah, but this was one of
24:49
the most -- I just didn't like it.
24:52
Because once in a while we would get somebody -- "Oh, yes, I'm interested."
24:56
Fine, that's how we got more people in.
24:59
But other times there were obviously Jewish people and they said,
25:05
"If I would have wanted to associate with [unclear] , then I would have
25:11
made it my business to get together with you. Please do not call me
25:14
again." These were doctors, these were people, you know, professionals, and I
25:22
felt very uncomfortable like that.
25:25
But this is what we were driven to.
25:31
It's hard for me to believe that we actually did that, sitting here
25:36
now 30 years later, but we did.
25:38
But it shows the dedication you had, to, well, establishing some education
25:45
for the children and all of that.
25:48
And I remember Ruth was wonderful, because she knew all the medical
25:50
people, and she said, "Among all these medical people, there have got
25:53
to be some Jewish doctors," you know.
25:55
Wonderful.
25:56
And that's what we did.
26:01
Before Hadassah was actually established, did you have representatives from various
26:07
Jewish groups coming here for any purpose whatsoever, fundraising, whatever?
26:13
I don't remember anybody coming for fundraising.
26:16
I do know that Ruth was affiliated with Portland Jewish Bonds.
26:23
You can ask her about it because I think she knows a lot more about it than I do.
26:29
We did have people come.
26:31
We would ask speakers from Portland to come down to talk with us.
26:38
But that was after Hadassah was organized?
26:40
I think even before that, because when Kurt was the Hillel advisor,
26:46
he did get speakers, and I remember him asking Rabbi Geller and Rabbi
26:51
Rose and other speakers that were available to come and talk to us.
26:56
That was before Hadassah.
27:00
: You mentioned earlier, to go back to something you said a long time ago,
27:04
about observing the dietary laws, and being the only family in town
27:10
that actually did that at the time.
27:12
I'm curious to know if there were ever visitors here who wanted to partake
27:20
of a kosher meal, and you were the only one who could provide that.
27:27
Can you remember any of those incidents?
27:32
We had a lot of interesting people because of that.
27:34
We had,
27:38
I don't know if I can remember all their names, but one famous person
27:41
who did come through was Shlomo
27:47
Carlebach.
27:48
He was, this was in the '60s of course, he was a flower child.
27:56
He is a rabbi
28:00
who led a very loose life, you know, was a real hippy, and composed many
28:09
nice songs, folk songs, and he was already quite famous at the time, and
28:15
the university asked him to come, and he
28:20
observed the dietary laws.
28:23
And he came to our house.
28:27
And I'll tell you, I won't say anything more about it because if
28:34
this is taped and might go in the archives, I really don't feel like
28:42
-- We'll save that for after we've finished taping, OK?
28:45
Are
28:48
there any others?
28:49
Then
28:52
there were Israeli officials who were attached
28:57
with the embassy in San Francisco.
29:00
When they came, not all of them but some of them did want to have a kosher meal,
29:07
and then they would stay at our house.
29:09
And other than that, we had many travelers who came through.
29:15
San Francisco at the time had a very very small Jewish community also.
29:20
There wasn't a kosher restaurant between Los Angeles and Seattle.
29:25
So we were sort of like the halfway mark -- halfway house.
29:29
And we had many people come and stay and eat with us.
29:38
Really, I wish now that I had kept a book, or, you know, a journal as to
29:43
who had come, because many people were very very, really, truly fascinating.
29:50
They enriched our lives.
29:53
Well I would like you to fill in anything that you can think of about those years
29:59
between -- although there really aren’t that many since you didn't get here
30:02
till '62, you said -- '62 to '64, when this organization began to keep records.
30:09
Hadassah.
30:11
But I thought we might talk about -- I'll give you a moment to think -- about
30:16
what were the most exciting and fulfilling events of those first few
30:20
years, before there was an organization.
30:23
I know you were a mom and what we would call, a long time ago, a homebody,
30:32
but
30:34
all your early years
30:36
. . . Before there was any organization?
30:41
I don't know.
30:44
I'd have to think about that.
30:52
[break in recording]
30:53
When we arrived to Corvallis, we found a card in our mailbox from
30:59
Ruth and Ben Goldberg inviting us
31:05
to a get-together at their house.
31:08
And I thought that was just really really nice, because it was the
31:12
first Jewish contact that we had.
31:15
And that says how Ruth and Ben were.
31:19
I mean, they were very very hospitable, and they were really the center of
31:26
the Jewish community, if you could call it that at the time, because
31:29
it was so amorphous, it wasn't really together the way it is now.
31:38
But they tried very hard, and they were wonderful to us.
31:43
And this is how we met a lot of the people, the Orzechs and
31:50
the Schechters, who were there at the time, and the Goheens.
31:54
So actually, that's one of your fondest memories.
31:56
And that was my last question then.
31:59
What are your fondest memories of the years leading up to the formal
32:03
organization of Hadassah, those few early years, as you look back?
32:08
Just meeting these people, because Kurt and I had never, from the
32:16
time we were married, we had never lived in a Jewish town.
32:22
Our first experience, when we got married, we moved to Kansas, and you can erase
32:30
this because it may not have anything to do with this, but we lived in a town of
32:35
3,000 people in Winfield, Kansas, where we were the very first Jews in the town.
32:44
They became very liberal because the small Methodist college that hired him also
32:52
hired that year its first black professor.
32:55
And
32:58
so you know I had never had Jewish friends after we were married.
33:05
I never had this idea, you know.
33:10
So when I moved here I thought, well this is going to be another Winfield, I'm not
33:15
going to have any, I'll just get along with my Christian neighbors and that's it.
33:20
So it was really nice to know that there were other Jews, even though they were not
33:24
observant, but they were Jewish, I could talk about Jewish things and they would
33:28
know what I was talking about, I wouldn't have to explain myself all the time.
33:33
So yes, this was nice.
33:35
Are
33:37
there any anecdotes about the children and their life during those early years that
33:43
you remember and would like to talk about?
33:46
Well they were small, before '64, they were small, and Howie was born of
33:53
course in' 65, that was our big event.
33:56
Oh
34:00
yes, as a matter of fact.
34:05
No, that was Howie, that was later.
34:10
But I might tell you anyway, just to give you an idea.
34:12
Howie went to the OSU nursery school,
34:17
they have a special program, early childhood, it was an
34:21
excellent nursery school.
34:23
Let's put this in time a little bit.
34:25
What year was that?
34:27
This was in '67.
34:30
OK.
34:30
We're a little out of our timeframe, but it's interesting material.
34:34
It was even later.
34:36
Probably '68 or '69.
34:38
And the head of that program was Leslie Morris, who is a member of
34:47
Hadassah.
34:47
She's not Jewish but she's a good, good friend.
34:52
And that's how I met her, as a matter of fact.
34:54
And Howie -- well the kids ate lunch there, and so we right away ran up
35:00
against this problem of what are we going to give Howie for lunch.
35:04
Well
35:08
they were just marvelous.
35:10
The cook interviewed me.
35:12
I didn't know, but they had their own cook there, and she interviewed
35:16
me, and I told her exactly what Howie could have and what Howie could not
35:19
have, and they were simply wonderful.
35:24
They arranged special meals for him without ever making him feel that
35:27
he was different in a negative way.
35:31
He was different in a very positive way.
35:34
And Leslie really used Howie as a wonderful way to teach the other kids.
35:40
Another learning experience.
35:42
So people have been absolutely -- whether it was in the public schools or
35:48
. . . And another thing I should say, because you did ask me how our kids felt.
35:52
This is again much later, this was when Lillian was going to high school.
35:57
She loved dramatics, the drama department or the drama club, and one of the things
36:09
that worried her was that the performances were on Friday night and Saturday night,
36:13
which would effectively cut her out.
36:17
And she had been in the drama group about two years when Mr. Malango,
36:22
her teacher, realized, why don't you ever want to take a part?
36:27
She was always on the fringes, she would do the scenery, she would do the costumes.
36:32
And even though she tried out and they wanted her to do it, she said
36:37
she can't because of Friday night.
36:38
He said, "Is that all the problem there is? Don't worry about it. We'll see to
36:43
it that we'll have a performance that you can be in Saturday night, and we'll
36:48
have somebody else taking the Friday night." They had never had that before.
36:50
It had always been if you did it
36:55
on Friday, you had to do it on Saturday.
36:58
When Mike was in high school they wouldn't give an inch for him.
37:06
These are the rules, these are the regulations, that's it, tough.
37:10
But with her they really made an effort, and they saw to it that she
37:14
would be able to take part on Saturday night rather than Friday night.
37:18
Mike preceded her in high school, and he did have a very hard time,
37:24
because he was a chess player, and his team was statewide, because
37:31
they won the state championship.
37:36
And his coach gave him a very very hard time.
37:41
This was only time in Corvallis that I can remember having to go to battle
37:47
because of a religious problem.
37:49
Because the coach would not let him
37:55
partake, would not let him go to Portland, even though all his teammates wanted
37:59
him to, which I found very interesting.
38:04
I don't understand why.
38:06
Because he would have had to, there was a problem because, you
38:12
know, we don't drive on Sabbath.
38:15
And there was a problem with food, but they had worked it all out, there were
38:20
going to see to it that he had his food, they were going to leave earlier
38:25
so they would get to Portland before the Sabbath started, and they were
38:29
supposed to come back then on Saturday night, on Saturday afternoon, and
38:35
Mike wouldn't have been able to come.
38:37
In other words there were a whole bunch of problems associated with
38:40
the fact that he is religious Jew, and the kids had worked it all out.
38:47
But the coach would not go along with it.
38:50
And it was really, we had to finally talk to the principal, we had to go
38:56
through the superintendent of schools.
38:58
Was that Wogaman at that time too?
38:59
Uh huh.
39:00
And Wogaman finally
39:04
talked to the principal and the coach, and finally put it
39:09
through so that he was able to go.
39:11
But it was really a nasty kind of thing, and I had never experienced it before.
39:17
Because we really had been spoiled.
39:19
Everybody had been wonderful so far.
39:21
It's a great record
