00:01
I am not shy as you can probably tell; [laughs] I am not important so what I
00:07
say is only going to be important, but if you don’t believe that, my wife—her
00:11
name is Zeferene—you can call her and she’ll tell you I’m not very important.
00:14
So… But go ahead.
00:17
When and where were you born?
00:21
I have to think my birthday June 19, 1932, in a small town in Greenville, Alabama.
00:30
My mother went there to have me because her grandmother was a nurse
00:35
in the hospital there and so she went there, and that’s where I was born.
00:39
I have never been there [since]; I don’t know what it looks like, but
00:44
that’s where her grandmother lived and that’s where her grandmother
00:48
worked, so that’s why I was born there.
00:50
Subsequent to that, I lived a short time in Montgomery with my grandmother.
00:56
I assume it was because I was a baby and my mother was a pianist
01:00
that had to travel so it was my grandmother who took care of me.
01:09
I don’t know for how long because I was a child, you know, but then my
01:11
mother and my dad moved to Flint, Michigan, and that’s where I grew up.
01:18
I went to school in Flint Schools, graduated from high school there.
01:22
Subsequently I went to college at Wayne State and I got my BS degree in pharmacy,
01:30
and then a PhD in biochemistry—both from Wayne State University.
01:35
Subsequently I was at Cornell [University, New York City] and a post doctorate
01:38
with a dear, a person who became a dear friend of mine name Lemuel Wright
01:42
and then when I retired—you see I’m retired—my wife said I was, when I
01:48
looked for a job, I interviewed with a guy name Vernon Cheldelin for whom the
01:54
high school, oh, the middle school was named after, and that was because he
01:59
was a friend to my mentor in Cornell, which was a guy named Lemuel Wright.
02:02
They both were at the University of Texas in the same laboratory where
02:07
one of them got his PhD and the other got his PhD from here [OSU].
02:10
So that’s how I got to Cornell and then I came here.
02:14
And I’ve been here officially since I’m retired…I officially was retired in 1998.
02:24
Since that time, I’ve been in here working on the research in atherosclerosis.
02:28
So that’s my academic background.
02:32
About
02:34
my parents—my mother’s name was Clara and my father’s name was Layden,
02:43
and they both now are deceased.
02:46
Where were they from?
02:47
They were from Alabama?
02:48
WG: Yes, that’s right.
02:49
My mother was from Montgomery and so was my father.
02:53
My mother went to college at Alabama State; she was a music major—and she
02:59
was a musician until we [children] came along and spoiled her schedules.
03:03
[Laughs] But anyway, there are five of us [siblings].
03:05
So, at any rate that’s how I got here.
03:09
The way I got here was through friends and my mentor at Cornell who was
03:15
a good friend of Vernon Cheldelin.
03:18
They were both at the University of Texas, they were grad students there.
03:22
Could you tell us more about your siblings?
03:24
WG: I have five siblings.
03:26
Three girls and one brother; I’m the oldest.
03:30
There are three girls in between me and my brother who is the
03:34
youngest—very much youngest.
03:36
I was seventeen years old when he was born and we all, of course,
03:39
said, “Mom, you waited too late.
03:42
He should go back.
03:43
We want to send him back.
03:46
It’s too late.” [Laughs] Well, we won’t say what she said,
03:53
will we?
03:54
Now they’re all, none of them are out here.
03:58
My one sister
04:08
also has a PhD. The second sister is a nurse.
04:13
Her name’s Betty and she’s the boss lady.
04:17
She bosses us all around.
04:18
[jokes] And then the third girl is named Caroline, and Caroline
04:23
works for General Motors.
04:25
We give her a hard time because she worked for General Motors as an
04:28
administrator and she’s the only one of us which doesn’t have a graduate degree
04:32
and she makes much more than we make.
04:37
We accuse her of getting a job first because my dad worked for General
04:42
Motors and secondly, the guy whom she worked for liked her since she was a
04:46
kid, so…that’s how she got the job.
04:48
But any rate, the final one is my brother, who as I said is 17 years
04:53
younger than I am and he likes to call himself a sociologist, but I would
05:00
rather refer to him as a politician.
05:01
He doesn’t run for office but he’s always doing something for those
05:04
who are out running for office.
05:06
He is still in Michigan and he is also now retired from General Motors, from
05:18
the business part of it.
05:19
Yeah.
05:20
So that’s my family history.
05:23
The one thing that I didn’t tell you, was that my mother –I mentioned that she
05:27
was a pianist—but the reason she had to retire was because first, not because
05:32
of me but the second and third child and she couldn’t take all those schedules.
05:36
There weren’t enough people to take care of the kids.
05:39
But none of us inherited that musical talent.
05:41
She was a tremendous pianist, and I
05:47
used to say to her I wish I could do what she could do.
05:50
You could play a fifth or a seventh chord, and she’d recognize that and if
05:53
you played the wrong note she could hear.
05:54
So she was very talented.
05:56
But none of us had that talent.
05:58
That’s a fact.
06:00
But I played in bands first E flat tuba, and then B flat tuba and
06:07
finally trumpet and then euphonium.
06:10
I love music and I played a lot so that’s probably I could say
06:13
is the one thing I do for fun.
06:17
Do you play here in Corvallis?
06:19
WG: Well, let me put it this way.
06:21
I did because the director of low brass was a guy named Warren and he
06:28
allowed me to play with the students, so I would go with them and play.
06:32
But along came the trouble with my, what are these things called: teeth.
06:38
So I don’t practice very much anymore.
06:41
And even when I play, it’s for me.
06:42
I put on my earphones—nobody can hear.
06:45
But anyway, I just love music, so… But I was not like my mom.
06:51
She was gifted and so that’s the way she made her living.
06:54
Was she a concert pianist?
06:56
WG: You would say that she was until she started to have children.
07:01
And then she just played for whatever she could do to make some
07:05
money to subsidize our family.
07:08
But she was a gifted musician.
07:10
I’m prejudiced, but I wouldn’t kid you, her talent was unusual and as
07:15
I could say, if you practice and played a bad note, she would come in
07:18
the room and say, “Read the music.”
07:23
It was good and bad having someone who’s that good when you’re not that good.
07:30
What
07:32
were your family’s expectations for what you would do?
07:35
Did they emphasize education?
07:38
They emphasized learning.
07:42
And they never told us that we have to go be X, Y, or Z—my mom or dad or anyone.
07:47
But you couldn’t not be a student.
07:50
Now my brother who is 17 years younger than I am, was quite different
07:57
from me in the sense that he’s very smart, but he did not like school.
08:04
So even when he was a little kid, he would wake up and say, “I can’t go today, mom.
08:09
My stomach is hurting.” Now she knew very well that his stomach wasn’t hurting.
08:21
We were reared in a family in which education was stressed.
08:26
Not to be rich, not to become this or that, but to learn.
08:31
And my great-grandmother insisted that we learn how to think.
08:35
And so she would test you on things—especially about things historical.
08:42
Tell us more about your great-grandmother.
08:43
WG: Her name was Mary Elizabeth Lawrence.
08:48
Her mother’s name was Molly Albritton.
08:51
Molly Albritton—I knew my great-grandmother until she died at 96;
09:00
she lived a long, long time.
09:02
Now her mother, Molly Albritton, was the daughter of a slave.
09:05
I have a picture of her on my wall.
09:12
She died when I was 37 years old, so she lived a long time.
09:16
Now then, there’s my grandmother, who was her daughter,
09:21
she had two children.
09:22
One was my uncle, my granduncle who was killed in the war—they said near
09:30
Paris or somewhere—in World War I.
09:36
He was my grandmother’s brother.
09:38
Yeah.
09:39
And I also have a picture of him.
09:43
Everybody in my family emphasized learning.
09:48
There is a difference between education and learning—they all emphasized that.
09:54
You wouldn’t have to tell my grandmother but once that you didn’t do your
09:59
homework and the steep punishment for me—there was no baseball for a month.
10:05
That’s all she needed to say.
10:10
[Laughs] My family weren’t so much concerned about titles, although my
10:15
I have one sister, the one next to me [in age] is the nurse, and she was very
10:23
good; she became the head nurse—she’s retired now—she was the head nurse
10:29
at General Motors Tech in Flint.
10:31
I used to kid her—she was very bright, but I used to kid her and
10:36
say that’s because my dad knows [someone at General Motors], who
10:44
knew Mr. C. P. Mott, who had more stock in General Motors than
10:49
anyone, and he also lived in Flint.
10:53
He supported the Flint School systems.
10:54
So she was the
11:08
head nurse of General Motors Institute, which was for
11:11
engineers and that sort of thing.
11:15
The youngest sister is an educator.
11:16
She
11:22
has a PhD in education and now, though, she runs her own business.
11:28
And
11:31
the one in between is Caroline,
11:38
earned a BS degree, but the others of us had advanced degrees.
11:42
And she made, I won’t say how much more, she made much more money than I ever
11:46
made if I added it up for a long time.
11:48
And I kid her too because my dad knew the guy in that part of the company.
11:54
And I said, “That’s how you got that job.
11:56
That’s why you make more money than I do.” [Laughs] But seriously, I didn’t get a PhD
12:04
because I wanted to make money or be brilliant.
12:09
I earned it because I was doing what I liked—biochemistry.
12:13
My dad was more financially oriented that I was.
12:19
When I was about to
12:22
graduate, I took chemistry and earned a degree in pharmacy.
12:32
My dad said “The rule is this: if you are past 18 and are not in school, you will
12:40
either have a job or you will be seeking a profession, or you’ll have your own place.
12:45
You can have 30 days back home if you are sick.
12:48
After that you’re gone.” And he was not joking.
12:52
So that I say that to you because when I graduated
13:10
I decided to get the chemistry degree, but then after my first
13:16
year, I was working in the United States Post Office as a temporary
13:20
hired student, a temporary worker.
13:23
That Christmas I was sitting next to three guys, we were on what is a
13:29
temporary desk where you either sort the mail and get it stamped or you
13:36
sort the mail.
13:36
So these guys, they were a little older.
13:40
Well this is my freshman year and they asked me was I doing, and I said “I’m
13:45
a chemistry major.” And they said, “We’re all chemists!” I said, “Why
13:50
are you sitting here with me on this temporary desk if you’re chemists?”
13:54
And these two guys, who happened to be Black, said, “We are having trouble.
13:57
We couldn’t get jobs right away at Dow and all these places
14:04
just wouldn’t hire us.” That’s why they worked in the post office,
14:06
and I was working there because the post office paid $1.65 and the
14:09
university was paying 50 cents an hour.
14:11
From
14:21
them
14:23
I learned that it wouldn’t be so wise to stop at the bachelor’s degree because they
14:28
were having a hard time, so I decided to go on for the PhD. Besides that, my mentor
14:33
as an undergrad was a guy named Larry Schrader who took me under his wings.
14:36
He was a biochemist who saw that I got a fellowship to go to grad
14:41
school and all those things.
14:42
I tell everybody that my life is filled with angels—that’s what I call them.
14:45
And every time I call him that, he would remind me that he was from Chicago,
14:50
“We don’t produce angels in Chicago,”
14:55
he’d say.
14:56
He was a guy...I like to mention that to you because I don't ever want to give the
14:59
impression that I could get into any of these places without somebody like Larry.
15:04
That's a fact.
15:11
I took the pharmacy degree, and I got the license.
15:14
While I was a grad student, I used to work on weekends, because I made more
15:18
money in Saturday and Sunday than from the fellowships that they gave me.
15:24
I could do this because I could do my experiments in the morning and
15:29
use the instruments and I could go to work at the pharmacy and come
15:31
back after work to check on things.
15:32
I also I had a lot of colleagues so if something went wrong, they would
15:35
just stop the experiment for me.
15:42
By this time, all the siblings underneath me were, except the youngest one, all
15:48
college age and they were all in school.
15:52
I didn't want to depend on my dad or anybody.
16:06
My father
16:08
was a machinist for General Motors.
16:23
My mother
16:29
would offer lessons but never charge any of the people in the neighborhood.
16:42
I was the only one to take up music, but my brother
16:50
took the trumpet up because that's what I started on.
16:52
He wanted to show, that he could do everything
16:57
better than
17:05
me, and he was—he was better [at the trumpet] than I am.
17:08
What was
17:16
your
17:18
early education like—what subjects and teachers did you like?
17:21
I was a guy who liked to learn.
17:23
So nobody had to tell me to do my homework.
17:26
In fact, I used to bug my grandmother until she got my books.
17:29
When I was in school, you had to buy your books; they didn't furnish them,
17:33
they furnished them in my early ages.
17:34
And in the
17:42
Flint School system, you didn’t have to buy books.
17:43
It was the best thing that I could have ever had.
17:50
Mrs. Moody was my sixth grade teacher and we said if you looked
17:55
sad, Mrs. Moody would give you the paper and the pencil and everything.
17:57
But, if
18:02
you didn't produce, you don't want to come in to her classroom.
18:06
She was very stern.
18:07
All
18:10
the guys liked her.
18:12
She was the head of the junior high school’s bachelor's club
18:17
where they taught the guys to cook and all those sort of things.
18:20
I should give it to you straightforward—I don't know how to cook.
18:24
At
18:26
this bachelor's club, the only thing I ever learned how to cook was cream puffs!
18:31
My
18:49
favorite teacher was Eula Benoit.
18:52
Now I'll tell you how I favored her because my daughter when she was
18:55
eight years old, like all children, she liked to go into my office.
18:59
And I'd tell her not to bother my things, but that didn't work so one day she found
19:03
my high school yearbook and was reading it and she ran out so fast, I asked her,
19:05
"Where are you going?" "I got to show this
19:11
to mom."
19:25
So my wife came to me and said, "Do you know what Priscilla brought?
19:28
What your book said?
19:29
She said look what Dad's old girlfriend wrote about him in this book." My wife
19:39
was laughing; she said, "No, no, that's not dad's girlfriend.
19:44
That's his Latin teacher!" I mention that because Mrs.
19:58
Benoit was my favorite teacher of all times.
20:02
And the reason is this: She was my Latin teacher.
20:04
I took Latin from her ninth, tenth, eleventh grades.
20:08
She taught us to read the Iliad and Odyssey and one time I said, "Mrs.
20:12
Benoit, I'm from Flint, Michigan.
20:15
I live in the ghetto and you got me reading the Iliad and Odyssey in Latin.”
20:21
I said, “What is this all about?" She said, “You need to be educated.
20:25
You're a good learner,” she said, “but I want to educate you.
20:34
Once when I
20:37
was in the ninth grade, I had a lot of guys who were friends, and we were
20:45
encased by all these things that you had to have—if you had this, I had that.
20:49
So I walked into her class on the first day and I had on a bright
20:52
yellow shirt—I'll never forget it.
20:54
It zipped up sideways and it had long sleeves.
20:58
It was the pride of every guy in my group not to wear an undershirt.
21:09
I walk into her room and I sit down.
21:11
I was early.
21:21
She was sitting at her desk and so I was sitting back and I was looking at her.
21:25
She wore these half-glasses; she was doing something, and she looked up
21:31
at me and she looked over the top of her glasses, she never said a word.
21:35
Now when I was fourteen, which is when I started in her class, I was four
21:39
feet eleven and a half inches tall.
21:42
And while I was at my desk, she stood up, Mrs. Benoit was 5'11" or 5'12",
21:48
she used to be a basketball player.
21:50
She stood up and she took my shirt, zipped it up, and then she took my hat
21:59
and took it off and put it on her desk.
22:01
We wore baseball caps, ‘course we didn't wear them forward, but we
22:04
were all wearing them backwards.
22:05
She took it and she said, "In this class we are all gentlemen. You will not come in
22:11
this class with your hat on." And she said while she was zipping my shirt up, “No
22:16
one wants to see your little puny chest.
22:18
Keep your shirt zipped up.” I was speechless.
22:23
I never said a word.
22:25
I never said any word.
22:26
I tell you this story because it stuck with me all my life.
22:29
What she taught me was discipline and that how you impress people
22:37
is very important.
22:38
So you come in and you act like a gentleman.
22:42
She would say to me, "Will, we know you're not a gentleman, you're talking again.
22:48
But you will learn that if you behave a certain way, people will draw a
22:54
conclusion which may not be accurate, but you want it to be a good one."
23:05
I didn't take Latin a fourth year because she was trying to convert
23:07
me into a Latin teacher and I said I'm not going to be a Latin teacher.
23:12
She was my favorite teacher.
23:13
Anyway,
23:35
the reason I mention Mrs. Benoit, is because she had the greatest influence
23:38
on me and she taught me things like what I just described to you.
23:44
If I saw her in the school yard or something, I'd take my cap off because
23:50
I didn't want to let her think I didn't learn what she tried to teach me.
23:54
It has helped me all my life because what people think of you, whether it is
23:58
accurate or not, is what they act on.
24:00
That's what she taught me.
24:01
So she's my favorite teacher—both because she taught me that and secondly
24:06
because she taught me to like things which I had never thought about like
24:10
the Iliad and the Odyssey in Latin.
24:18
What lead to your interest in biochemistry?
24:19
Now
24:25
remember, as an undergraduate student, I was a chem major.
24:28
So I already liked chemistry.
24:50
Remember I decided I would do the pharmacy program because I knew if
24:53
I did that I could get a license and I could also go to grad school.
24:56
So I took the pharmacy program and chemistry.
25:15
When I finished my pharmacy degree, I took the state boards, the practical, the
25:23
theoretical, and the licensing ones.
25:25
So from that point on, I was a licensed pharmacist.
25:27
And my classmate was another kid named Willie Flonori.
25:32
His father owned drug stores, so not because I was a great pharmacist, but
25:38
because he knew I needed the money, I could work on weekends in their
25:40
place, and they let me set the hours, and I would also cover for people.
25:44
So in those two days, I
25:51
made enough money that I didn't have to worry about the scholarship money.
25:55
But the scholarship led me through the grad program.
26:01
So that's what I did.
26:04
We still keep in touch, and believe it or
26:11
not, he became a lawyer too.
26:15
[Laughs] I told him he just wanted to maintain that family money, I
26:18
don't think he was interested in law.
26:25
My interest in biochemistry was because I liked chemistry, and I like
26:29
biochemistry because two things: one is I was going through the pharmacy
26:32
program so I had to have it anyway, and then when I finished, I did
26:37
postdoctoral at Cornell with Lem Wright.
26:39
And the way I got here was Lem Wright, who was my mentor at Cornell, and
26:45
Cheldelin—a school in Corvallis is named after him—went to grad school at
26:50
the University of Texas, both of them.
26:53
When I started interviewing for jobs, I interviewed with Cheldelin
26:57
first in a meeting and then I came here and gave a seminar; that's how
26:59
I got the job here at Oregon State.
27:01
I took the job here because the department would let me keep
27:03
up my credentials in pharmacy.
27:06
I did not work here in pharmacy because I was too busy.
27:10
And when I was
27:13
here, the teaching loads were a lot more than what I was accustomed
27:17
to at Cornell or at Wayne State.
27:22
But I kept that license.
27:23
And I took all the tests all the time just in case I needed to [go back to pharmacy].
27:29
And so that's how I was doing a post-doctorate here.
27:34
I need to emphasize that everywhere along in my life, there
27:37
has been, I call them angels.
27:39
There's been somebody like Mrs. Benoit who taught me the meaning of discipline
27:43
and also made me like reading the Iliad and the Odyssey, you know.
27:49
I'm a ghetto kid.
27:51
I couldn't even spell the Odyssey.
27:54
[Laughs] But at any rate, she taught me and I liked it.
28:00
Mrs. Benoit’s husband was an engineer, and a very kind person; he also tried to
28:05
convince me to do some engineering and I said “No, I have to do something that
28:09
I know I can get a license in.” And I knew I could in the state of Michigan.
28:13
Also my dad was still alive and I knew I could get a job.
28:20
About your time at OSU—why did you come here?
28:25
I came here because Lemuel Wright was a friend of Vernon Cheldelin, who was
28:30
a dean, and he and Vernon had been graduate students at University of Texas.
28:38
I had met Vernon at meetings, but I never talked to him about a job or anything.
28:46
I was interviewing at various places and Vernon invited me here
28:51
and he offered me a position in 1962 in the chemistry department.
29:17
I had lots of helpers in industry, not because I was brilliant, but like
29:24
Lemuel Wright, and he knew people.
29:28
I interviewed at Mead Johnson.
29:30
Well, they were colleagues like if you two are colleagues somewhere, so they
29:36
all knew each other and so I got these invites to go to places to interview like
29:42
DuPont, and to interview at Mead Johnson.
29:46
Everything that I got to do was not dependent on my being brilliant
29:54
per se, because the guys who were introducing me and said I was good,
29:58
were the ones who got me in the doors.
30:00
Now I'll give you an example, I'll tell you what the times were like.
30:05
Mead Johnson is in Evansville, Indiana, and Mead Johnson was located in
30:10
Evansville and when I went there, the schools had just been desegregated.
30:16
But when I arrived at the airport, and walked inside there on the pavement,
30:21
there was the public address system saying—listen to this now, for me,
30:25
you got a little kid from Flint and this is the first time I've had my
30:28
name on a PA system saying, "Dr.
30:31
Gamble, you are wanted at the white phone desk."
30:37
This is a big airport and I wanted to say, “Which doctor is that?”, but I did
30:43
pick up the phone and there was one of the administrators at Mead Johnson welcoming
30:49
me, telling me where my hotel was, and that there would be a taxi outside,
30:58
waiting to take me to the hotel, and, if I needed to run an errand or so some
31:03
shopping, a taxi would come back for me.
31:06
And I said I wanted to pinch myself.
31:08
Are you kidding?
31:10
But it was because the man who was a big man at Mead Johnson was a
31:16
classmate of my mentor at Cornell.
31:18
And he's a tremendous human being.
31:21
Now Mead Johnson at
31:25
Evansville had only desegregated the schools maybe three or four years before.
31:31
And so I decided we called the neighborhood.
31:33
So I decided I'd better find a neighborhood and find out
31:35
what this place is really like.
31:36
That means I want to find out where Blacks live, so I went
31:39
into this small restaurant.
31:41
The guy I was talking to said, when I told him where I was from, I said,
31:44
"I'm not from there, I'm from Flint." And so I got to talk to one of the
31:52
managers and owners of the restaurant and he asks me why I was there.
31:55
And I said I'm coming to Mead Johnson to interview.
31:59
And he said, "You're going to interview at Mean Johnson?" I said yes.
32:02
He said, "Are you still Black?" [Laughs] I
32:06
said, "I hope so.
32:07
My phenotype is so obvious I don't think you have to worry too much." But then I
32:12
told him who invited me. He said, "Wow!
32:15
He's the number one man!" And it was true.
32:18
He was a really very smart biochemist, and a very nice guy.
32:24
So that night he invites me to his home and about six or seven administrators
32:29
at the high level about six or seven.
32:31
So it was they and I. They never asked me any questions or anything.
32:37
They treated me as if I were one of their guys.
32:41
The next day I go to meet a friend of mine named Bob Harkins, we were grad
32:45
students together, and I met him earlier that morning before he started to work.
32:50
And I said, “I have my own taxi." He said, "Will, how did you get us a taxi?" I said,
33:01
“The boss man said there would be a taxi for me again." Bob said, "Will,
33:11
now I ought to warn you: Mead Johnson only has one Black
33:14
person working in this unit here.
33:16
Only one, and he is the boss man's chauffeur!" And
33:22
so I went round and they gave me a badge and they said, "You go wherever you like!"
33:27
People were speaking to me like they had seen thousands of Blacks, you know.
33:31
They saw this badge on me and then I had a little pin that they gave me.
33:36
I didn't know what the pin was about; I didn't care, but they said
33:39
“That's a priority pin.” That meant I can go anywhere in the place.
33:44
Anyway, so that's the way he treated me and that's how I
33:47
interviewed at Mead Johnson.
33:49
But I ended up coming here.
33:50
That's where I got here because there was a chemistry department; I'm a chemist
33:55
and I could still be a biochemist.
33:57
So that's why I came here.
33:59
And besides I knew Vernon way before; I knew I met him first when I was a
34:03
first-year graduate student because they all come to the meetings and
34:06
my mentor at Wayne State wanted to make sure that I am there.
34:11
He said they'll notice you because in the circles he traveled in,
34:16
there was some other Black guys—a couple of them from Harvard—but
34:19
he said there won't be that many!
34:20
So you get people to remember that they saw you, the guys that they hang out with.
34:25
And I literally mean, hang out with, you got to see them
34:27
when their meetings are over.
34:30
Then we'd go to dinner and they become real guys just like we are.
34:33
So anyway, that's what happened.
34:34
But that was thanks to him.
34:35
When
34:42
I came to OSU, they had more teaching load than I had ever experienced in my life.
34:49
By that, I mean at Cornell, nobody taught as much as they taught here.
34:54
And I was the little guy in the department.
34:56
All these guys were senior guys.
34:57
I knew a lot of them because I’d see them at meetings, but
35:00
I didn't know them personally.
35:01
So in that department, just me and one other guy were the youngest ones
35:04
and then finally a third guy came.
35:06
We were in the disciplines: I was in biochemistry, one was in analytical,
35:10
and the other one was in physical.
35:12
The one in physical was named from India.
35:16
He wasn't born in America.
35:19
He was a physical chemist and he was so used to a different type
35:25
of assignment, that it was really hard for him those first years.
35:28
In fact, after the second year, he had a lot of trouble.
35:32
We had to ask him to take some paid leave.
35:36
For example, he was Brahmin Indian and he'd never washed a dish in his life.
35:41
And he didn't know what a dish was, he said, "What is a dish called?"
35:45
We got to be friends, you know, but I said these are the two extremes.
35:49
We're like polar distances, you know?
35:51
And it was hard for him because we were doing things as the junior
35:55
guys that he was not used to doing.
35:57
And he really couldn't take it for awhile, but the chairman was very cognizant of
36:05
that, so he told him, he took him away from assignments like we had and let
36:09
him concentrate on his classes, and then till he get his feet in, and then
36:15
the chairman said to me, “Will, you stay with him because you're our ghetto
36:19
kid. You can bring him down to where you are, so he'll learn to deal with
36:24
a little dirt!" And that's what I did.
36:26
He's a really nice guy.
36:27
He's brilliant though, very smart.
36:28
But that was hard for him—just really hard and to think that
36:32
it was hard for him here.
36:33
And I said, "If you lived in Flint," you know, I said, "I'm
36:37
not going to take you to Flint.
36:38
You got to be finished before I take you there because these
36:41
people will be speaking a language you never heard before.
36:45
And they are my friends.” But you know,
36:49
he finished the year, he went down to Cal Tech.
36:52
He was a great guy.
36:54
At any rate, that was my first-year experience.
37:01
I still took time to do my research and also I had all my connections.
37:05
But
37:07
most guys were not used to doing that much teaching that we did
37:10
here, but myself, because of my undergraduate training, I had quote
37:19
"taught students" in the laboratory.
37:21
Schrader, the guy who got me all these jobs, he would take me into the lab and
37:27
sit me with one of the graduate students.
37:29
So I knew something about things, I knew how to do a teaching
37:32
lab—there was no problem for me.
37:34
But for my Indian friend, to have to do that teaching job, and then you got all
37:37
your classes and all that too, was hard.
37:39
But he finally came around.
37:46
The research, for me, was good.
37:51
Would you give us an overview of your work?—most of what we found
37:52
was related to atherosclerosis.
37:54
That's because that's the disease I worked on a long time.
38:11
So I worked in the lab too after my classes with Larry Schrader,
38:16
the guy who eventually got me the scholarship for grad school.
38:21
And Larry is working on steroids.
38:25
Cholesterol, for example, is a steroid.
38:27
So
38:31
I learned all about steroids from Larry.
38:33
I will show you though, I made one statement in my first assignment
38:37
in his lab as a worker just so that you realize how he taught me things.
38:44
There's a disease called porphyria—it's a failure of your
38:47
blood to take the molecules of your porphyrin and make hemoglobin.
38:51
So the porphyrin molecules of your hemoglobin have four of these units.
38:55
They are like this: like you had a rectangle, but they were sitting
38:58
in the middle of each of these lines, and they are linked with
39:03
an iron molecule in the middle.
39:04
They are very critical for synthesis of
39:10
hemoglobin, for example.
39:10
If you don't have hemoglobin, you're in real trouble.
39:12
But in people who have porphyria, one of the steps
39:21
is missing.
39:23
And lots of patients had it, and it's usually manifested when someone becomes
39:30
an alcoholic because they notice this the amount appears larger and so my first
39:35
assignment now— I was still an undergrad student when I was working in the lab,
39:40
I would come in after my classes and work—was to take samples from people
39:46
who are porphyric and one of the places they are where people are alcoholics.
39:52
You know people who go for alcoholic treatment, they have a lot of porphyrins
39:54
in there, and therefore, we could study these things in their excrement.
40:00
So, believe it or
40:03
not, I was very surprised, but one of the best places to get a lot of samples
40:07
in Michigan and the Detroit area was in the beautiful farm area where they had to
40:11
send priests from all over the country who had somehow become dependent on alcohol.
40:18
And so they were there and all their histories were known and that's where we
40:21
got samples from to get the porphyrins.
40:24
Now they weren't drunkards, you know, but they were sick people who they should not
40:30
have been drinking any alcohol at all.
40:32
And they were priests;
40:36
they were sent to this hospital, and that's where we
40:38
could get a lot of samples.
40:40
And my first job was to take, excuse the expression, both urine, that
40:47
was not so bad, and feces, and extract the porphyrins from it.
40:51
And my friend Dupree, we were dear friends for life and he used to say
40:55
to me, "Gamble, if you think [like we used to help each other], he’d say, if
40:59
you think I'm going to come and help you with this work, [he said] you are
41:03
not going to pass a certain sample to me. You will do that one! I will do
41:09
the liquid one." But it wasn't bad.
41:11
They froze it before and then we had a big hood so you don't,
41:14
it can't escape into the room.
41:16
Its equivalent for us is just like a chemical sample, then we just treated it.
41:20
So that's what we did the rest of the time I was an undergrad—both he and I.
41:24
He was also the best man at my wedding.
41:27
And now he calls me up; he called me last year on his birthday, which is March 17.
41:33
I'm telling you the story for a reason.
41:34
He called me up and he said, “Will, we're the same age.
41:37
I'll be 78 this year.” He calls me last year and says, “I made
41:42
it.” I said, “You made what?” He says, “I'm 77 now.” He said,
41:47
“I call you on my birthday to pray for you because yours is in June
41:51
and I don't know if you're going to make it to June!” This is my friend.
41:54
[Laughs] He calls me on his birthday to tell me he's praying for me
41:59
to make it to June.
42:00
He is the craziest person in the world I'm going to tell you.
42:04
So come March, he'll probably call me again and wish me luck,
42:08
but that is the environment I worked as an undergrad student.
42:14
Then finally, I got to be a grad student and I worked there.
42:17
I did not work with Schrader believe it or not, I worked with Dr.
42:19
Warden and I worked on porphyrins.
42:22
And porphyrin chemistry, that is what I did for a part of my PhD degree.
42:28
But I also, when I still got finished with a postdoctoral with Wright at Cornell,
42:34
I had to choose something of my own.
42:36
And so I chose atherosclerosis because it involves a lot of
42:40
chemistry and that's what I like.
42:44
It involved steroid chemistry and that sort of thing.
42:47
So I'm still working, believe it or not I'm retired now, but I'll
42:50
tell you briefly that when I came here, the reason I chose to work on
42:55
atherosclerosis was because more people die of that than any other disease.
43:11
They want to know what I've done and can you be an independent worker.
43:13
So I started working on atherosclerosis, and the Oregon Heart Association
43:17
gave me my first grant for this work.
43:20
Now I'll tell you very briefly and I'm going to give you some propaganda.
43:25
Not right this minute, but I'll give you a little thing that describes
43:29
something I did for people who perhaps don't know much about the disease.
43:34
If I don't have it here, I'll find you and get it to you on campus.
43:37
It's my propaganda.
43:39
Anyway, so atherosclerosis is a disease in which is, forgive me, I
43:44
don't know if you know, of course.
43:46
If you don't watch TV, they say, "Take Zocor, take Lipitor..." and Zocor made
43:54
$7.9 billion two years ago and at the same time Lipitor made $5.9 billion gross.
44:01
Those are the drugs, and I should tell you that they do the same thing.
44:04
There's no magic in either one of them.
44:07
So atherosclerosis, from my point of view, was to study it to try to
44:12
learn what the etiology is and was.
44:15
So to get a system to work with it I chose to use animals, and I chose
44:23
to use first bovine—cows—because they have these huge arteries.
44:28
And I could get samples.
44:32
So what we did, and I'll quit saying “I” because I had a lot of students helping
44:36
me, is to ask yourself the question, "Why does this stuff accumulate in the artery?
44:42
Why do you get cholesterol there?”
44:46
Then you get high blood pressure.
44:49
But if you get an embolism, which floats and gets in your brain, you get a stroke.
44:54
Now this disease was first described in 1500 B.C. by the
45:00
Egyptians in those mummies.
45:03
They described the disease, they described the material.
45:06
Now they didn't describe it in the kind of detail that we now can speak about.
45:11
So what I decided to do was to try to learn why does this cholesterol accumulate
45:17
and what is the nature of, chemically, what is the nature of the disease.
45:23
Now I studied this for a long time, but what I wanted to do was to ask the
45:30
question, "How can we understand [it] and why does this occur?" I go back to the
45:36
fact that it's been known since 1500 B.C., so I'm not suggesting that Will Gamble
45:40
has the answer, but I'm going to give you propaganda before you leave so that you
45:45
can say Will Gamble's crazy, but anyway, so I won't let you leave until you do
46:01
that.
46:03
I say it's a theory because we can write “theory” down on any paper
46:06
we want to and nobody can take it
46:12
off.
46:12
Let me tell you, first, there are certain animals who do not get the disease.
46:17
Bears never get the disease.
46:22
Polar bear, brown bear, sun bear, any of the bears—none of them get the disease.
46:31
They eat berries, you know, but the bears can eat anything, and they
46:34
can eat you if you [get in their way] like with the big taller ones.
46:37
So, that the idea that it’s only due to dietary reasons is probably not correct.
46:46
But animals that hibernate, they don't have it, none of them.
46:48
Cows have
47:00
the disease, deer
47:04
have it, salmon have it, trout have it.
47:09
And people eat them and say they are going to help themselves to
47:13
keep from having the disease.
47:16
Trout, salmon unequivocally have been shown to have it.
47:24
The animals that don't have it all live and hibernate.
47:29
I chose to study the bear because of two reasons: one of my
47:33
colleagues is named Ursula Becker.
47:35
She's a faculty member here and a wildlife veterinarian who
47:41
works with all kinds of animals.
47:43
She's also a consultant for the Wildlife Safari, and so that
47:49
gives us access to the bears.
47:52
And now, the reason we chose the bears is, as I said, they don't have the disease
47:56
but their cholesterol levels are the same as ours—humans—in that same range.
48:00
And they eat whatever they want to eat.
48:05
So this is a simple reason that I give for them not having it.
48:11
When animals that hibernate, you could take the raccoon, an
48:20
animal which can hibernate, and if you look at that animal in the summer when
48:27
he first wakes up from hibernation, it's clear for most of them, and I'm
48:31
talking about now, animals like a wild rat, a marmot, whatever, and they will
48:40
not have any plaques when they wake up.
48:42
A friend of mine in Colorado says he works with them, but when they keep
48:47
them until the fall comes, and they examine the animals, and the normal
48:54
food dies, then they have plaques.
48:57
When they wake up in the spring, the ones they save, none of them have plaques.
49:02
So something happens to them while they are sleeping.
49:05
And what we do is to study the bears through its blood because
49:07
you can't kill the bears.
49:18
So if
49:22
you argue that the bears, when they examine them, in the spring when
49:26
they have no plaques and most of the time they don't have them anyway.
49:29
So my argument is simple: there has to be a reason.
49:33
The
49:38
bears we work with are at the Wildlife Safari.
49:42
We have worked with Washington State because they have 28
49:45
bears that live outside and
49:49
they work with bears all the time.
49:50
We needed large samples to study the blood.
49:53
So the bear can hibernate.
49:59
Brown bears may get to be 1400,
50:03
1600 pounds.
50:05
Now the mother bear will eat and she gets fat and she goes and now the zoologists
50:15
don't call it hibernation, they call it “torpor.” And when a biochemist like
50:19
I says hibernation, they say, "They're not hibernating, it's torpor." Well, let
50:24
me put it this way, they go to sleep.
50:27
[Laughs] They will sleep for that whole period.
50:29
When they start out, they may weigh 1400 to 1600 pounds.
50:30
The mother bear
50:41
is pregnant and neither she, nor any bear goes to the bathroom during the
50:47
time they're in this hibernation.
50:50
She births the cub, wakes up, cleans off the placenta, then goes back to sleep.
50:55
She doesn't take any water, she doesn't eat any food, and she does
51:00
all this in that period of time.
51:02
Now, what
51:05
Gamble’s explanation is that they [the bears] are able to recycle the water.
51:10
So when the bear eats a lot of food first stores it all as fat, the energy as fat.
51:15
Now fat is made of fatty acids and glycerol.
51:19
Everybody knows what glycerol is, it’s a carbohydrate—it’s just carbon, hydrogen;
51:22
it’s like water except it’s glycerol.
51:26
And fatty acids are attached to it in the three positions.
51:29
There are just long , long chain things, I don’t know if you remember
51:33
your chemistry, it doesn’t matter, they have, fatty acids are like this [draws
51:37
a diagram] , they have a lot of carbons [drawing on pad of paper] and these are
51:39
all—I have to do it right, so you can read.
51:42
Students used to stop me in the middle of lecture, “we can’t read what you’re
51:46
writing thank you very much” [laughs] . So, it’s got these carbons but at the
51:50
end of it, it has what we call a carboxyl group. Now it’s more, I’ll just put it
51:55
in because it’s longer than that. Now when this material, and now she stores
52:00
it, and this is glycerol I’ll just put that there, and glycerol looks like this.
52:04
So all it’s made of these two.
52:06
Now,
52:10
here’s my oxygen on this side.
52:12
Glycerol is like
52:17
this, that’s like the stuff you buy or least my wife does sometimes
52:21
and puts it on this and that.
52:22
And this is a fatty acid, let’s see an example, there’s a fatty acid called
52:28
stearic acid, there’s one called palmitic, now the reason I tell you about palmitic
52:34
is because it’s a fatty acid, but soaps are made of base, and fatty acids.
52:42
And palmitic, is the one
52:47
that the brand Palmolive is named for.
52:47
Now,
52:57
what the bear does is eat a lot, gains weight and never eats anymore,
53:02
and what happens in this is when you have a fatty acid, these little
53:06
things [referring to drawing] are all converted to carbon dioxide.
53:09
Now, everybody knows about that now, because they say,
53:10
oh too much CO2 in the air.
53:13
So, the fat converts that to this and the hydrogens become water.
53:17
Everybody knows that H2O, so it’s producing CO2 which is water
53:26
and a gas.
53:26
But the bear never
53:31
wakes up [during hibernation], it sleeps all that time and
53:34
it never goes to the bathroom.
53:36
And that intrigues me, because, you figure, how can
53:40
you not go to the bathroom?
53:41
And you’re doing all of this, now when he produces CO2 he
53:46
exhales that, he gets rid of that.
53:48
When he produces water he just recycles it.
53:52
His kidney will recycle the water and he does not accumulate a lot of
53:57
other things because of this process, what he does is just using fat.
54:01
That’s his energy source.
54:03
And so, he’s only producing CO2 and water, the water the kidney recycles,
54:07
the CO2 of course, he breathes out and maintains acid/base balance.
54:10
They
54:14
just take the fat and convert it to CO2 and water.
54:18
You get energy when you do this.
54:20
The water is stored and they exhale the C02.
54:24
Now, you guys say why doesn’t the fat, the bear get acidic and get an upset stomach?
54:30
Well it’s because the bear can maintain the pH of its blood by doing these things,
54:35
gets rid of the excess CO2, cycles the water and then uses the energy derived
54:41
from these bonds to produce energy.
54:43
Everybody knows about ATP, it produces [indistinct] . This is the
54:44
energy, this is the compound which
54:50
the cells use, adenosine triphosphate, can you see my writing?
54:53
It has
55:10
these bonds in it, so three phosphate bonds.
55:15
Ok, and I’ll just, I’m just doing a little biochemistry, I’ll just write so you can
55:20
see it.
55:20
I should go to the board [indicates white board on wall, moves to white
55:23
board] . Here, this, it has, three of these, phosphate, phosphorous
55:30
derivative, part it’s called a phosphate.
55:46
It has a molecule on the end called adenosine, now, you don’t
55:49
have to know the chemistry.
55:50
But it’s attached here, and when this wants energy, the cell breaks it down.
55:56
It breaks this bond, and it forms, when it’s broken, it’s associated with some
56:03
reaction which drives it, the reaction.
56:06
Then, if you eat food then it stores it back in this, so ATP is
56:09
kind of a thing for storing energy.
56:11
Now, the bear, eats a lot of food and he has therefore a lot of ATP, and
56:17
but when he breaks this down to from carbon dioxide, now that’s acidic.
56:22
They tell you now they don’t want too much in the air, right?
56:24
He breaks the CO2 and he has water, but he cannot excrete the water so,
56:31
he just keeps recycling the water
56:34
and he pushes the CO2 out of his lungs and he controls this process so he doesn’t get
56:39
alkalitic , too much acid or too basic.
56:42
That’s the normal process for a lot of animals, but nobody but hibernating
56:46
animal can go as long as this, a bear will be in there three months, never
56:50
go to the bathroom, and he never gets alkalatic, never gets acidotic.
56:57
And, I tell everyone, I don’t know how the bear does
57:05
it.
57:06
We can’t, that’s for sure!
57:06
But the bear goes all those months without going to the bathroom.
57:09
Now, I told you it was because, when you say what does this have to do
57:13
with the bear not having the disease?
57:15
So, I’ll just make it simple and say, what I’m saying is that bears can hibernate
57:19
and all the animals that I know who hibernate, none of them have the disease.
57:23
Not one.
57:25
And I make a point of saying that they tell you to eat fish, that helps you to
57:30
not to get the disease, and that’s true, but the fish itself gets the disease.
57:35
And, but the bears never get the disease.
57:39
They also will lie in that position, all that time, they move around, and they
57:44
never get osteoporosis or osteopetrosis.
57:47
No soft bones, no hardening.
57:50
And the thing that gets me personally, is that I don’t how or why they were
57:56
made up, but the thing they do is that because they have all this acid
58:00
produced they neutralize it with base.
58:05
So that the keep they maintain the acid.
58:07
They help maintain it by getting rid of the CO2 just like we do,
58:11
if we didn’t breathe in and out the CO2 we end up being acidotic.
58:15
So the bears breathing out but he’s also neutralizing it, and
58:19
then it uses the energy so that he doesn’t have to eat anymore.
58:24
Now, why did I mention that to you?
58:25
Is that, I don’t know why that’s true, but I do know that all the animals
58:31
that we know that don’t have the disease have the capacity to hibernate.
58:37
So I took that argument and said why does that happen, and it’s a simple
58:50
one.
58:52
This paper tells you what we’re doing.
58:54
Yeah, so now what happens they say is that here’s your artery, and you have
58:59
any artery, and you get these plaques inside here and they block off [draws
59:03
on paper] and the plaques have the things that I’ve mentioned in them.
59:07
But you say, “How come the bear doesn’t have this problem?”
59:10
The truth is that I don’t know.
59:12
But I wrote this theory to try and explain what happens.
59:35
I want
1:00:03
to give you an idea
1:00:07
of why we say in our theory of why the bear does not get
1:00:12
this plaque formed in here.
1:00:14
Now the plaque contains the following—protein, and you all will know
1:00:22
what that protein is when I tell you.
1:00:25
It contains albumin, and albumin is the stuff you have in egg white.
1:00:31
So it does have, but it also has cholesterol as a protein, not the
1:00:39
only protein, it has cholesterol, it
1:00:51
has calcium, and it has phosphate.
1:01:02
The normal blood doesn’t have any trouble with any of these things.
1:01:07
But what happens when you get atherosclerosis is that you accumulate
1:01:12
high levels of cholesterol, and you have to be able to maintain that in some kind
1:01:18
of solution otherwise it will fall out.
1:01:21
You have water in the system, you have these types of protein
1:01:26
in the system, albumin, and so these are soluble in water, but
1:01:31
cholesterol is not soluble in water.
1:01:32
Now you also have fat or lipids.
1:01:41
Cholesterol
1:01:44
is a lipid, so it is not soluble in water.
1:01:55
So what happens when you get the disease, for reasons which are
1:01:58
not, in my opinion no one can unequivocally say, this cholesterol
1:02:04
starts to fall out of solution.
1:02:12
If fat stays in solution, it can
1:02:20
emulsify and keep it in solution.
1:02:21
So
1:02:24
there are things that can keep it in solution normally.
1:02:27
Even though the disease was first described in 1500 B.C.,
1:02:32
I’m about to tell you that nobody really knows the etiology to this day.
1:02:36
That’s why they can sell you [cholesterol drugs] and make billions of dollars,
1:02:43
because you want to keep this stuff from falling out of solution.
1:03:34
Cholesterol is not soluble in water, and it’s a big molecule, this is the way
1:03:39
it looks [drawing on board] . Now this
1:03:52
is cholesterol, I have a double bond there.
1:03:54
Now, this is a picture of cholesterol, but it doesn’t like water so it’s insoluble.
1:04:02
That’s OK.
1:04:03
But your body normally keeps it surrounded by protein and fat and it just goes along.
1:04:08
But if you get too high cholesterol, it’s going to fall out of solution.
1:04:13
So,
1:04:15
my argument is that, it’s ok it won’t do any harm there.
1:04:19
But happens is that if it falls out of solution then you get you get these
1:04:23
plaques formed in your blood vessels.
1:04:38
I’ll give you a good example, you take a piece of rope and you cut
1:04:42
it up real fine and you put it in your mouth, it won’t dissolve.
1:04:47
Now, if you swallow it, it will go right down to your digestive tract
1:04:49
and usually you won’t die from it, it’ll be surrounded by things.
1:04:54
So that eating the cholesterol that gets out of you is not the problem.
1:04:58
But in your vessel you have too much cholesterol it starts to be insoluble.
1:05:02
So what happens is that let’s say that you just get these crystals,
1:05:06
they just start falling apart in here.
1:05:08
But normally, they’re usually surrounded by fat and proteins
1:05:14
which keep it in solution.
1:05:15
But in your vessel what happens is that when it precipitates out, when it
1:05:21
falls out, now, all these things which gather around it and encapsulate it
1:05:26
so now it can’t dissolve very easily.
1:05:29
And therefore,
1:05:32
the stuff will start to accumulate.
1:05:34
And pretty soon, if you’ve got too much, it will accumulate and block
1:05:37
and the worst thing that happens, once it gets there and if it’s
1:05:40
encapsulated with calcium carbonate.
1:05:42
Then it’s not ever going to come back into solution.
1:05:45
Now calcium carbonate is what your bones are made of.
1:05:48
So when you’re encapsulated with calcium carbonate, now, I’m
1:05:51
telling you, that’s a problem.
1:05:53
But how does the bear avoid it?
1:05:54
This is Gamble’s prejudice: it’s called a theory [laughs] . The bear avoids it
1:05:59
because the bear has absolute metabolism control over its CO2 metabolism.
1:06:05
It never gets acidotic or too much.
1:06:08
So the bear never gets to this stage.
1:06:10
And the reason it doesn’t get to this stage is because the bear does not allow
1:06:14
the calcium carbonate to stay there.
1:06:17
It keeps the calcium ion which is perfectly happy in the water
1:06:20
and converts it back to CO2 which the bear now exhales out.
1:06:25
That’s what the bear does, he never lets the calcium carbonate and the
1:06:30
other proteins which are present there, he never lets them get big
1:06:34
enough to encapsulate that cholesterol.
1:06:36
So
1:07:01
that’s,
1:07:27
it’s,
1:07:41
that’s the simple argument that I make and then I argue with my colleagues about it.
1:07:48
So what I’m saying is that for some reason bears and animals which can hibernate
1:07:54
which control their carbon dioxide
1:07:59
metabolism don’t have that problem.
1:08:03
Now, you say how come?
1:08:06
Now, if you were to put your head in a paper bag and let that CO2 come in and
1:08:12
you breathe too much you’ll faint because your body is telling you something.
1:08:17
And if you left it too long you probably would have some trouble
1:08:21
with your acid-base balance.
1:08:23
But generally you’re saved because you can’t breathe it too long or you’ll
1:08:25
faint and then you take the bag away from
1:08:45
your
1:08:48
head.
1:08:48
I’ve been studying atherosclerosis
1:08:53
since 1962.
1:08:56
But remember back in
1:09:05
1500 B.C. is when they first wrote about it and nobody knows the theory.
1:09:09
I don’t care what they say, nobody knows the etiology and if they tell you they
1:09:12
do they’re not telling the whole truth.
1:09:15
We still don’t know.
1:09:16
And this, this is what I said this is my theory, a simple theory that the
1:09:20
reason that the bear doesn’t get it is the bear’s metabolism allows it
1:09:24
not to allow the calcium carbonate to trap this cholesterol in it
1:09:33
. If it’s encapsulated you can’t dissolve it, and you can’t, so when it breaks
1:09:39
open it forms plaques all inside of the thing, and now you’ve got
1:09:43
calcium and that’s just like having lime inside of your body, you know.
1:09:46
And they also make crystals, which can be sharp, and then
1:09:46
people start hemorrhaging inside.
1:09:46
So basically, now but that’s a theory, no, as
1:09:55
like I said and I keep repeating, 1500 BC they described it,
1:09:58
the Egyptians knew about it.
1:09:59
Everybody knows about it, but there’ve been several Nobel prizes, but I
1:10:03
can tell nobody knows exactly why.
1:10:10
What people have been the biggest influence for you at OSU, and why?
1:10:15
Now, let’s see, I came here as a junior guy and the person that gave me the
1:10:19
most support was the chairman, when
1:10:23
I got here, Bert Christensen.
1:10:26
Bert Christensen was a personal friend of Lemuel Wright who was
1:10:29
my mentor at Cornell, so I sort of had it made when I applied here.
1:10:37
The person that invited me [to OSU], Vern Cheldelin, he Wright were both graduate
1:10:41
students at University of Texas together and they had been lifelong friends.
1:10:45
So you know I was brilliant to get this job, right?
1:10:48
[laughs] Extremely brilliant!
1:10:50
[laughs] They gave me a job, now remember I came in 1962 this place was
1:10:55
something for a kid from the ghetto, is a kind of strange new environment.
1:11:00
I’d go.
1:11:02
But here people would ask me, why did I come to Oregon, and I’d say I’d come to
1:11:07
Oregon, I’d tell them for this job at OSU.
1:11:13
And they’d ask me do you fish?
1:11:14
I’d say no.
1:11:15
Do you hunt?
1:11:16
No.
1:11:17
Do you ski?
1:11:18
No.
1:11:19
Do you mountain climb?
1:11:20
No.
1:11:21
Do you hike?
1:11:22
No.
1:11:23
[laughs] I said no, I’m an urban person, they’d say well why’d you come to Oregon?
1:11:27
I said, well, my father always told us when you’re 18 you either be in school or
1:11:36
you have a job and you be out on your own.
1:11:40
You have your own place.
1:11:48
My mother did not agree with this.
1:11:52
Now
1:11:55
[for]
1:12:08
the girls, that’s different; they don’t have the same rules for the
1:12:11
girls as they had for us [two sons].
1:12:12
They don’t want them in despair, but my brother and I,
1:12:16
he was 17 years younger than
1:12:27
me.
1:12:30
We’d go visit holidays and all that, and we’d go visit Mom on the weekend.
1:12:35
My dad was trying to teach us a lesson, and later, as I’m
1:12:39
an older man, I appreciate it.
1:12:52
Anyway.
1:12:53
I just said that Vern Cheldelin got me here
1:12:58
and Dr. Christensen was my boss.
1:13:00
Excellent, I mean, he said to me, “Look,
1:13:06
we want you here.” He said, “Lem is a personal friend of mine; he
1:13:12
wouldn’t send anybody who’s not good.
1:13:13
He [Lem] spoke very highly of you, he said, they would even keep you
1:13:17
back at Cornell,” but I told him no, no you don’t want to get a
1:13:21
job where you do your mentoring, people know you in a different way.
1:13:30
The day I came to give my seminar, Vern Cheldelin was there; he was a
1:13:33
professor in chemistry too but he became the Dean of the College of Science.
1:13:36
So you know, I was brilliant, right?
1:13:46
[Laughs] And, I’ve been away many times now, I mean, I go on sabbaticals.
1:13:53
So I was at NIH three times.
1:13:56
How long were you at NIH?
1:13:59
WG: A year each time, I was in the lab
1:14:18
at
1:14:27
NIH.
1:14:27
I also was a Fulbright at Ghana.
1:14:31
I lived in Ghana for twelve months at the University of Science and Technology.
1:14:39
Here’s what happened, I got this information about
1:14:43
Fulbright on my desk one time.
1:14:46
And also, I knew a person at Cornell who was from Ghana, we
1:14:54
were working for the same guy.
1:15:01
So I applied for a Fulbright and I got it.
1:15:05
I’d asked for special permission to be away, ‘cause I wasn’t here
1:15:08
long enough to have a sabbatical.
1:15:10
And so I went to Ghana in 1971 to the University of Science and Technology.
1:15:17
And it turns out that the Chairman of the Biochemistry Department was the guy
1:15:21
I told you I knew from Ghana at Cornell.
1:15:24
He was the chairman there, but in fact when I got the Fulbright
1:15:28
he, he had left to go to Lugan where he was the chairman there!
1:15:34
So he wasn’t there when I got there, but he was a friend.
1:15:42
So I took my family, my wife and my daughter,
1:15:45
and we stayed there a full year on the Fulbright.
1:15:48
I taught biochemistry and enzymology at the University of Science and Technology.
1:15:51
I had a
1:15:58
great time there, of course they speak English.
1:16:01
And so, one of my students from Ghana came to OSU, and was one
1:16:13
the best students we’ve had here.
1:16:19
Eventually she became a dean.
1:16:20
She was a brilliant student, the first student at that university they ever gave
1:16:27
first class honors , you know what I mean?
1:16:29
They’re on the British system.
1:16:31
In, in chemistry, she was the top of her class.
1:16:35
When I got there, she was at that time a student, and she had
1:16:40
already won all kinds of awards.
1:16:42
So, she was in my class, two of my classes while I was there.
1:16:46
And then after, before I left Ghana she wanted to come here, and I said fine, so
1:16:49
we brought her here as a graduate student.
1:17:01
My daughter went to school on the campus in Kumasi, Ghana, the primary school.
1:17:06
And she was 7 years old when she arrived there; by the time she
1:17:11
left she was speaking fluently one of the local native languages.
1:17:15
Where I lived on the campus, they provided faculty housing and for
1:17:21
some reason we were very lucky.
1:17:21
On that campus there was an art school.
1:17:25
You know, Ghana has a lot of art.
1:17:27
And so, it was an art college, but they had moved the college to another
1:17:29
place, so we got to live in the
1:17:34
president’s house, I don’t know why.
1:17:37
But at least ‘cause I knew, remember, I knew the chairman of
1:17:40
the department before I got there.
1:17:48
I wouldn’t take anything for the experience, students were all
1:17:51
very intense and sharp and easy to instruct so I had a good time.
1:17:58
And, my wife had to adjust of course.
1:18:05
So you could get at the stores in Kumasi anything you can
1:18:10
get anywhere because the British were and are still there.
1:18:14
It just cost you more money.
1:18:16
My daughter went to school there, and this was the greatest shock for her.
1:18:21
She was in, they call it, class,
1:18:25
here she was in the first grade, had been.
1:18:30
You know, she finished that year before we left so she was
1:18:32
supposed to be in the second grade.
1:18:34
When she first got her first report, they give you kind of a warning report.
1:18:40
And it says that she didn’t know the math, and the one that got me
1:18:45
the most was that she was getting, was having difficulty with religion.
1:18:50
And I said, how did she get that?
1:18:52
And it turned out that it was a Catholic nun who taught this aspect of religion
1:18:57
to them, it wasn’t against any rules.
1:18:59
But, I asked my daughter Priscilla about it, my wife claims she’s like me.
1:19:04
But at any rate, I asked her; she said, “Dad, this nun said our hands
1:19:13
are from God, we are to use them, use them from God.” I said, “What’s
1:19:18
wrong with that?” She said, these are my hands, they’re not God’s
1:19:22
hands!” [laughs] . But about the math.
1:19:26
So I go to the math teacher and I see that they’re giving them long divisions
1:19:32
and multiplications and everything and she’s in the second grade!
1:19:36
And so, I said “oh my goodness!”
1:19:40
The teachers showed me the test.
1:19:44
So, I told them , “My wife’s pretty good at math.” And I said to her, “You’ve
1:19:48
got to work with her every day, she’s never seen that.” She didn’t even know
1:19:50
what a test was, she’d never had a test!
1:19:54
So, every day my wife had to go over the math with her.
1:19:58
She was a little bit reluctant because she’d never had to do that
1:20:01
before, but we couldn’t afford to let her get poor grades there.
1:20:04
And so by the time she got through, I said how did you like it?
1:20:09
She said, “I’m never going to take second grade math
1:20:13
again!” [laughs] . All the way through, but at any rate she [my daughter]
1:20:17
survived. She’s pretty good at reading she’s pretty good at writing. But
1:20:20
she’d never had any math like that.
1:20:21
And when we came back I went over to her teacher, and she said, “Oh, no
1:20:25
they’ve never had that.” And I said that was like me throwing her into
1:20:29
a fire where she wasn’t prepared.
1:20:31
But she made it and she survived.
1:20:32
The worst part was
1:20:37
though, was that she was failing religion.
1:20:40
And I said no, gosh, I take her to Sunday School every day, every
1:20:43
Sunday here and they teach her about the Bible and all that.
1:20:47
And so, I went there and the nun said, “She’s ok but she just won’t do certain
1:20:54
things.” And I looked at her and I said, I didn’t say anything in the presence of the
1:20:59
nun, I said ok, we’ll make sure, my wife will make sure she knows what she needs to
1:21:05
know. But she was very unhappy, she said, she keeps saying my hands are made for
1:21:11
God [laughs] . She couldn’t get over it.
1:21:16
I said, “Priscilla Ann, you have to do whatever this nun says, we
1:21:20
cannot have you go home, the only class you’re failing is religion.
1:21:24
This is not good.”
1:21:30
Her math teacher’s name was Mrs. Teti, and she had
1:21:54
this bright red hair, freckles, and I looked at her and I said, “You must
1:22:01
be masquerading as a Ghanian,” and she said “I’m a Ghanian.” And then she
1:22:05
said do you want to see my children?
1:22:07
I said yeah, pictures, and she said, “oh they’re here I’m about to take them home.”
1:22:12
She brought them in, there were two of them, a boy and a girl, bright red hair
1:22:18
[laughs] with freckles. Now they weren’t Caucasian freckles, they were more
1:22:23
brown, but they were true freckles.
1:22:26
Now I had a little when I was a kid so I wasn’t so surprised at that.
1:22:28
But, my point is that, I was very surprised.
1:22:32
But then, the longer I lived there, I realized that this
1:22:34
is a very heterogenous place.
1:22:35
These people were absolutely all
1:22:42
Ghanian.
1:22:43
It was a good experience for my daughter, when she got back here.
1:22:47
They were asking me, was she so far advanced?
1:22:49
And I said, are you kidding me?
1:22:52
[laughs] Advanced?
1:22:53
I was teaching her and my wife spending every day trying
1:22:56
to keep her to keep up with
1:23:06
them.
1:23:06
We understand that you were one of the first faculty members to
1:23:10
establish Black fraternities at OSU, would you tell how that came about?
1:23:12
How important do you think they and the Black sororities are for
1:23:14
the students of color on campus?
1:23:17
The guy who was responsible for that was the one who also started the
1:23:22
Black Cultural Center, you know?
1:23:24
And he was a Kappa and so was I. So, and the alumni chapter in Portland,
1:23:32
they have an alumni chapter and they also have undergrad chapters.
1:23:35
And, I knew him and he knew that I was a Kappa.
1:23:39
Now, you should understand that I was Wayne State and
1:23:42
Kappas are a social fraternity,
1:23:53
Kappa Alpha Psi.
1:23:54
When I say it’s a Black [fraternity], it was.
1:23:55
But, two of our members on the campus were of course, Caucasian.
1:24:00
We’ll
1:24:02
say historically it was a Black fraternity.
1:24:05
And most, but here [at OSU], I mean you have about five cents’ worth
1:24:10
of Black students here [laughs] and we going to form a fraternity!
1:24:13
So, but this fraternity’s charter does not indicate any race, but historically,
1:24:21
in the southern states, they were all Blacks.
1:24:23
But when I was at Wayne State, because we knew each other, you know, two of
1:24:28
the guys who joined were Caucasian.
1:24:30
So here, we,
1:24:35
and the guys in Portland would come down because they had alumni,
1:24:38
to teach these kids what to do.
1:24:40
The reason that I was involved, and Lonnie was involved, is because we were Kappas.
1:24:47
I was a Kappa at Wayne State, and Lonnie was a Kappa at, I think, Tennessee State.
1:24:53
So this is
1:24:59
a historical Black
1:25:02
fraternity, but it is not and never has been restricted to Blacks, by the
1:25:08
fraternity . Anybody or any background or race can join the Kappa Alpha Psi.
1:25:15
It’s just historically, when they were in the South, there were hardly anyone else
1:25:19
to join but Blacks, and Blacks couldn’t join the Caucasian [fraternities].
1:25:23
So, the reason Lonnie came to me is ‘cause he knew I was a member.
1:25:28
And the guy in Portland who also knew I was a member.
1:25:32
So, they wanted to form a chapter here and they did because there were
1:25:35
some Black kids down here, some of whom were athletes some were not.
1:25:41
They knew about these fraternities because they were from other
1:25:45
places and we didn’t have any here.
1:25:48
So, Lonnie, myself, and people from the alumni chapter in Portland all, did the
1:25:56
proper things, you have to go through the whole ritual to apply and all of that.
1:26:00
And then, they had, I think, maybe 10 or 12 kids who wanted to be members.
1:26:07
And you go through it, you know, you can see how silly we are as
1:26:10
kids, we call it, the initiation is called the Burning Sands [laughs]
1:26:29
. You know, you think about it, guys are crazy.
1:26:31
Nobody would complain because you supposed to be tough, you know
1:26:34
[laughs] . Listen, I don’t know, if I was to judge by my daughter, I don’t
1:26:38
think the girls have to be that way.
1:26:41
But guys, this is where.
1:26:42
So that’s how it got to be, and I was active as an undergrad
1:26:46
from all the way through.
1:26:47
And, then partially in the grad, because that I went to grad school in biochemistry
1:26:52
after I finished at the med school.
1:26:54
So I was very active and here, when I came there was nothing here.
1:26:58
And once in awhile I’d go and see some guys up in Portland just to hang
1:27:02
out with them, keep in touch with what’s going on with the fraternity.
1:27:04
So this is how that came about.
1:27:07
And, but the fraternity has never had and never will [have] a
1:27:10
restriction on membership from anyone.
1:27:14
Even in the south, but you know none of the Caucasians in the south
1:27:17
were going to join a fraternity associated with Black kids.
1:27:22
Of course, ‘cause you’re too young, you may think, that may sound foreign.
1:27:26
But that it was true, but it’s true, no problem about it.
1:27:29
But we were in Detroit, I was at Wayne State.
1:27:33
And like I said, we had,
1:27:37
two guys that I knew who were Caucasian.
1:27:39
Then we had, there were several more, because, I don’t know about you girls,
1:27:44
but we’d just hang out together.
1:27:46
And we hang out because we have common interests.
1:27:50
And my wife says that interests turn out to be very common, because she,
1:27:55
at one point, was one of those common
1:28:02
interests.
1:28:02
And, no it’s true.
1:28:05
Of course, she had friends too who were not Black, of course but we were.
1:28:08
So, it’s Black because it’s traditionally Black and there are several and they
1:28:12
have big meetings, national meetings and
1:28:24
all of that.
1:28:26
You just hang out with people, it’s a common interest, and sometimes in a
1:28:30
place like Flint, it’s a common defense.
1:28:33
You got to have a group otherwise you gonna get pushed off the…we’d
1:28:37
play basketball you know.
1:28:39
Playground basketball, and if you don’t have some guys on there who are good,
1:28:47
you’re not gonna play very long because every time you lose, you sit down.
1:28:50
And so, on the playground it’s, the guys are chosen by their ability
1:28:55
not about whether they’re Chinese, Japanese, Black or whatever.
1:29:01
And so, you get to hang out with guys who like to play the way
1:29:05
you do and that sort of thing.
1:29:06
So it’s not, it’s not like the structure becomes more acute, I think when
1:29:12
it comes to boy-girl relationships.
1:29:15
Like, you know, if the girl is Asian and her daddy is from thousands of
1:29:19
years back, you show up on the steps.
1:29:22
They won’t say anything but there is a cultural thing.
1:29:28
But for most of my friends we’re working our way through school, we’re saving
1:29:32
money, marriage and seriousness is not a part [laughs] of our thoughts, forget it.
1:29:38
I know my wife because her parents’ family were friends of my dad’s family.
1:29:46
They’re from way back, some went to school together and all that.
1:29:50
But, I didn’t know her, and the only time I saw her was when they’d have a picnic.
1:29:57
She was too much younger than I was.
1:29:58
I’m a teenager and she’s three years younger than I am.
1:30:02
Like she, I’m 18, 19—she’s 16, 15: forget it
1:30:09
[laughs] . But because her family and my family, father’s families from
1:30:15
a long way back, that’s how I got to know her at these family things.
1:30:22
I didn’t marry her until she was in her twenties.
1:30:25
You know, I didn’t even date her until she was in her twenties,
1:30:30
But, she was much younger than I am.
1:30:33
She’d point it out to you all if she were right here [laughs]
1:30:37
. Yeah, so kind of the follow up to that is that, you know, I understand
1:30:44
that historically this was a Black fraternity, and it sounds
1:30:47
like it was the first one at OSU.
1:30:48
WG: Correct.
1:30:49
But now, there are several more.
1:30:50
WG: That’s right.
1:30:51
What do you feel the importance is of those organizations
1:30:54
are for students of color?
1:30:54
WG: Well, the thing is this.
1:31:02
I come from Flint, Michigan.
1:31:03
We weren’t sophisticated, I mean, we were just kids.
1:31:07
We had sports, and all that.
1:31:09
They were just a part of life.
1:31:10
But mine was baseball, they used to claim that I should’ve
1:31:12
become the baseball preacher.
1:31:14
‘Cause that’s all I did, I said you play basketball, I’m 5’9”,
1:31:17
then you go play basketball.
1:31:19
But while you’re on that baseball field, I’m the man.
1:31:21
I don’t care if you’re 6’6,” you can’t hit it any farther than I can.
1:31:27
They played playground ball like you sit and wait and play.
1:31:30
But it’s a cultural thing, these guys will sit on your chest and not apologize,
1:31:35
you know what I mean, it’s just a game.
1:31:37
So now here, the reason that it is important is because if you
1:31:42
are not a strong person and you arrive in a town like Corvallis.
1:31:45
Now when I arrived here, I probably could count when I see some Black
1:31:49
person—no, you weren’t even thought about.
1:31:51
But so,
1:31:54
it helps them to meet someone
1:32:03
where you hang out and do the same kind of things.
1:32:06
You speak the same language, and it’s not the King’s language.
1:32:10
Like, for example, we used all kind of terms when I was growing up.
1:32:20
For example, you never say to another colleague or guy who
1:32:24
hangs out with you what is it?
1:32:25
You say “what it is?”
1:32:31
You never say “what is it?” to him, he’ll look at you; he’ll say you’re
1:32:35
no English professor, get over it.
1:32:42
Because you want to be part of the group you learn the language.
1:32:45
And so, these kids are here now, they come from various places, especially when they
1:32:49
used to come from Los Angeles, they come from Los Angeles and they go to Portland.
1:32:53
I’m talking about Black kids, and see, I was an advisor too.
1:32:56
And I was in the fraternity, so I knew young kids when they’d come.
1:32:59
They’d come from Los Angeles, and people would tell them to go to Portland ‘cause
1:33:03
there’s a Black community up there.
1:33:05
And they’d come back to me and they’d say I didn’t find any Black community.
1:33:11
They said, those people aren’t Black, I don’t know who they are
1:33:18
[laughs] . I thought you told me there were some Black
1:33:20
communities up in Portland.
1:33:22
He said, no, no.
1:33:23
I had one kid, my wife just loved him because he was here from Los Angeles
1:33:27
and he was a street kid, and she knew she had married a street kid.
1:33:30
So, once she met him she’d have him come to the house to eat.
1:33:34
And, but he always complained, he said, I go there and I talk to these people,
1:33:39
there’s nothing Black about them, except their skin, it’s obvious they
1:33:43
have dark skin but they’re not Black.
1:33:46
You know, and I said, well, I grew up in Flint, so if you were to go to
1:33:50
Flint, right now, not now because this place, they’ve made it a ghost town.
1:33:54
When you go from any other town, like, let’s say Saginaw, those little
1:33:59
towns where they do have Blacks.
1:34:01
Then they gonna come to Flint, it’s another world, it’s entirely a different
1:34:05
world, because the kids are all different.
1:34:08
And
1:34:14
they make their own language.
1:34:15
And they speak sometimes and nobody understands what they’re talking
1:34:18
about because it’s in the language.
1:34:20
Now, the reason that I knew both [ways of speaking] was
1:34:23
simple; we’d hang out with guys.
1:34:25
But Mrs. Benoit, I told you my Latin teacher taught me a very important
1:34:30
lesson, and when I walked into her class that , I told you, I was like
1:34:35
every guy that I hang out with.
1:34:37
I didn’t have my shirt zipped up, I had it down.
1:34:41
I didn’t take my cap off, and she was the only person in the room, and I sat down.
1:34:47
Now, my grandmother, great-grandmother, if they knew I did that in the
1:34:50
classroom they’d probably shoot me.
1:34:51
But, but they weren’t there and that was at school, you are in this culture.
1:35:00
They’d have what people call ice cream type parlors and that,
1:35:03
you just go there to hang out.
1:35:05
Now, if you go in there, you go home from school you stop in the parlor for
1:35:09
a few minutes and you still have your books, and you walk in there, you don’t
1:35:15
want to do that, if you’ve got a bike or something, hide ‘em in the bike.
1:35:18
‘Cause when you walk in there, they’ll ask, “What are you trying to prove with
1:35:25
all these books?” you know [laughs] . So there’s a culture, that they keep up
1:35:30
with the language. But, nine out of ten of ‘em are just like in my family:
1:35:35
you don’t do your homework, you don’t get good grades, you’re in a world of
1:35:38
trouble. Because they’re in a place like Flint, they do have the schools are
1:35:42
great, and you have the Mott Foundation.
1:35:44
You don’t have to do anything but go to school and your parents who are
1:35:47
there trying to get out of the hole.
1:35:49
And if you mess up, any and all of the guys I knew and didn’t know, knew if you
1:35:55
mess up that’s a deadly serious thing.
1:35:57
So they still have a subculture though, they still talk this language
1:36:01
and they do things which are stupid.
1:36:03
Including myself, you know, you say things which are stupid.
1:36:07
But, you’re at the college here now and that’s a different place.
1:36:10
So they need to meet guys who can speak their language and still
1:36:14
know that the language is stupid.
1:36:17
You know what I mean?
1:36:18
You have to understand that.
1:36:19
But, if you try to take it away from them precipitously then they’re
1:36:24
not happy; some will even leave.
1:36:26
But Lonnie, who started that program, understood that, he worked with juveniles
1:36:32
from there and all over the country.
1:36:34
And he understood the Black youth culture and that what they have
1:36:39
to understand this is not a Black world, even if you go to Africa.
1:36:43
If you go to Ghana, and you’re speaking like you do from Detroit
1:36:48
they’ll look at you like you’re crazy.
1:36:49
You may have the same or some of the same types of pigments or features,
1:36:53
but they don’t care about that.
1:36:56
They don’t care if you black, white or green, there’s a
1:36:59
strong culture and some of
1:37:05
it’s tribalistic, you know what I mean.
1:37:08
In fact, some kids, when I was there, went to University of Lugan and
1:37:13
they got into a world of trouble.
1:37:15
There was almost a riot there, college kids coming from all over the
1:37:20
United States, but they came there to go to school, a special program.
1:37:27
These people have
1:37:37
been brought up here [in Ghana] all their life, everybody they see mostly is Black.
1:37:40
You know, that is no identifier, they don’t identify with you on
1:37:42
the basis of the fact that you may have pigment or whatever.
1:37:46
So you have to learn that there are cultural differences.
1:37:49
And here, this was a problem because they just didn’t have anyone to identify
1:37:53
with, what I call phenotypically.
1:37:56
But, once they deal with the students, they learn that there’s
1:38:00
no difference, you know, no more than the other group of people.
1:38:04
You find the guys you want to hang out with.
1:38:08
But, even when I came [to OSU], I was the only Black person
1:38:12
in the Chemistry department.
1:38:14
The only other non-white person was the guy I told you from India.
1:38:20
Any rate,
1:38:29
this is a good thing to have some of these [Black fraternities] here.
1:38:31
But they don’t take the place of you’re learning how to deal with anything.
1:38:38
And, I never had any trouble with that because I had a
1:38:40
great-grandmother and grandmother all dealt with all kinds of people.
1:38:44
And even what we call the old country.
1:38:45
My great-grandmother was a nurse in a little town called Greenville
1:38:49
where my mother went to have me.
1:38:51
But
1:38:56
dealing in that Deep South, there were cultural things in some people
1:39:00
who didn’t obey the rules in terms of segregation and that sort of thing—they
1:39:05
were trying to hold Blacks back and that.
1:39:08
Of course my great-grandmother though,
1:39:13
I showed a picture of her mother to a friend of mine who was from who was
1:39:18
actually from Puerto Rico and he looked at my great-grandmother’s mother and he
1:39:29
said, “she has blue eyes!” and I said, “wait a minute, this is a
1:39:33
black-and-white picture,” and look at her eyes, her eyes are really, really
1:39:35
light and she had not typical what I would call African-like features, and
1:39:44
she was my great-grandmother’s mother.
1:39:47
And my great-grandmother didn’t look like her mother.
1:39:50
But she was a fair person, and she had hair like you [indicating an interviewer
1:39:54
with straight, shoulder-length brown hair] , she wore her hair very long.
1:39:57
Now, what I’m saying is that when you live in different places like my family did.
1:40:02
The ones who were my siblings, you would know they are all Black,
1:40:07
they are all African-American, you could tell right away, because none
1:40:10
of us are like those ancestors.
1:40:12
But, what I’m trying to say is that it is not a simple matter.
1:40:19
What you need to do, and I was an advisor, is find a guy, or if you are
1:40:25
a girl, who is like you—forget about everything else and you will be just fine.
1:40:29
And if you tell me you can’t do that you’ve got a problem and
1:40:32
you need to solve that problem.
1:40:33
It’s not a problem.
1:40:34
I mean if that were true, I wouldn’t be sitting here.
1:40:37
Everyone who recommended me for this job, they were Caucasian!
1:40:40
And I had lots of colleagues here, you know, the chairman
1:40:41
of the department—they were
1:40:46
all Caucasian.
1:40:47
I was the only Black person there.
1:40:55
And then we had two superiors, by superior I mean higher
1:41:01
positions [at the university] who were Chinese.
1:41:04
So I guess what I’m saying is, yes these things are real, but they’re just like you
1:41:09
know: should you have a Fred Myers store?
1:41:11
Should you have a K-Mart?
1:41:14
For those kids when they first get here, they feel smart, and they’re intelligent.
1:41:19
You don’t pick your friends by only the guys in the fraternity.
1:41:23
They are what you call your “running buddies.” You can’t survive
1:41:30
with that.
1:41:31
There are things that you do that you are already familiar with that will be
1:41:35
in this group of kids, so you have that and so if someone tries to ostracize you,
1:41:41
you don’t feel that you’re so alone, but
1:41:46
it depends on the person.
1:41:47
It never was a problem for me so I guess because of where I grew up and
1:41:51
the way we were educated and trained.
1:41:54
I don’t meet a stranger—my wife thinks I’m crazy—because I’m sitting in a
1:41:59
restaurant and next to a guy—if I don’t ask him who he is or what and we get
1:42:03
into a conversation pretty soon because I’m just next to another human being.
1:42:11
Do
1:42:13
you have any
1:42:25
opinion
1:42:44
or ideas about
1:43:02
why
1:43:18
the proportion
1:43:32
of minority students has essentially remained unchanged over time?
1:43:35
What could OSU do to attract more minority, particularly
1:43:38
African-American students?
1:43:39
WG: First, they are going to come to a place if they are—and it’s terrible
1:43:48
now because people don’t have any money, they are losing their housing.
1:43:52
If a kid came from there now he’s need a lot of help because he’d
1:43:55
have to make a too many changes.
1:43:58
I don’t know, I have a lot of nephews and they
1:44:03
have good jobs, but even though they can get a transfer,
1:44:07
they can’t sell their houses.
1:44:23
My father worked for General Motors for a long time, so he was quote a
1:44:27
“middle class person.” We lived on
1:44:37
a street which has about eight houses and three of them are boarded up
1:44:40
now—at least they were when I was there last summer. That means because
1:44:47
if they leave them, people just break in, take all the fixtures and
1:44:50
everything and nobody’s going to stop them because these guys are horrible.
1:44:54
They will hurt people.
1:44:55
So all I’m saying, my aunt lives there, who is my mother’s sister
1:44:59
and she is actually the last living person in my mother’s family.
1:45:03
She lives there, but she’s lived there a long time, since she was a girl.
1:45:06
The neighborhood she lives in, it’s still, you know, a lot of people aren’t
1:45:11
moving because these people are old.
1:45:13
They’re in their houses and they are also lucky because they have
1:45:16
retirement and they have social security, just like my aunt.
1:45:20
She’s not going to move because it would take somebody with a bulldozer to get her
1:45:23
out of her house, because, you know, she’s a widow, and her kids are scattered except
1:45:29
a couple of them still live in Flint.
1:45:31
So you’re not going to get her to move out of there.
1:45:33
But it is a tough place to be now; it’s very difficult
1:45:38
because of the economic status.
1:45:40
But your specific question was about like—I think you need to have
1:45:44
someone in your life that a person sees at least once in awhile, with
1:45:48
whom, he typically, he recognizes.
1:45:50
It would be like if you went to visit relatives in a town—you
1:45:55
know all your relatives there.
1:45:56
But you’re not unhappy because when you go to a place you don’t
1:45:59
look to expect to know anyone else.
1:46:04
You don’t want to display ignorance, so will you go to
1:46:07
somebody that knows your family.
1:46:10
Now they’re in the same position—they have to find someone—not,
1:46:16
and it’s not a racial thing.
1:46:18
It’s not even ethnicity.
1:46:19
It’s just someone with the same experience, the same kind of
1:46:23
experience and they can ask questions and they won’t sound, they won’t
1:46:27
feel stupid to ask the question.
1:46:28
So that’s a good thing to have, a good think to have quote “a native from the
1:46:32
city.” It’s good to have people from everywhere whether they’re from America
1:46:37
or not. Now that’s a bias on my part.
1:46:39
But I think it’s good to made to deal with something you don’t
1:46:44
normally have to deal with.
1:46:46
And there are certain things that happen that people are surprised at,
1:46:52
in the culture, like in my family, as I said, there are three girls.
1:46:58
My dad is from the old school.
1:47:00
But he is a guy who would invite anyone to the dinner table.
1:47:04
If they didn’t have a place to stay, my brother would get so upset, because he [my
1:47:07
dad] would make a place for them to stay.
1:47:09
That’s just the way he was, he was just, he didn’t care, see
1:47:11
he worked for General Motors.
1:47:13
They are all kinds of people, they’re from all over the world;
1:47:14
he didn’t care who it was.
1:47:16
So that is not the problem: the problem is that when young kids start to grow
1:47:19
up, as where we used to say, to give you an idea of how it was—I don’t
1:47:23
know how it is now: I’m an old man.
1:47:24
But in Flint, when we grew up, there were people from everywhere.
1:47:27
My street was like the United Nations, because they were all there, most
1:47:31
of them were not rich, like my dad—they were there because they
1:47:34
were working for General Motors.
1:47:36
So what I’m saying to you is that if you come to a place like this [Corvallis] and
1:47:41
you don’t see anybody you know typically that looks like you—you see them on
1:47:46
television—but it would be helpful if you want to have somebody to hang out
1:47:51
with or share with or whatever, because you have something in common, so I
1:47:55
think to have them [Black fraternities] is good, but they are expensive.
1:49:35
What would have done differently, if you could
1:49:46
do anything differently?
1:49:48
What would I have done differently?
1:49:48
To be honest with you, I wouldn’t have done anything differently.
1:49:48
To be honest, well, when I say this, I would like to have had different results.
1:49:51
When I got here, I would like to have had a fraternity of guys.
1:49:58
See, I grew up in a family where
1:50:04
we, like I told you, I had a grandmother, a great-grandmother,
1:50:08
a grandfather, and then I had
1:50:13
all my aunts and uncles—my mother’s family was seven children:
1:50:18
four girls and three boys.
1:50:21
So I grew up in that kind of an environment.
1:50:25
Each one is different.
1:50:26
My uncle, who was the youngest among them, he’s the one I wanted
1:50:30
to be like because he liked to do all these irresponsible things!
1:50:36
[laughs] The rules didn’t mean too much to
1:50:43
me.
1:50:44
Like for example, my wife, she’s not a very vocal person, but she’s also
1:50:49
happy within herself, so it didn’t bother her that she didn’t know
1:50:53
[anybody], but as soon as she got to be in chemistry, she knew the chemistry
1:50:56
wives, then she belonged to, what do you call it, it was like a faculty
1:51:01
club that everybody belonged to.
1:51:03
I’ve forgotten what it was called.
1:51:04
But they still probably have it, and they had a newcomers’ thing.
1:51:08
And she’s not at all what I would call a socially outgoing person.
1:51:14
But she was perfectly happy with being here.
1:51:18
What she did miss was her family who were a long ways away, and when we came
1:51:23
here, her husband was the assistant professor so it was maybe holidays
1:51:27
and summer to go back to Michigan and plane fare then was relatively high.
1:51:32
But she was able to adjust to being here.
1:51:37
Because I grew up in a family within a lot of people and we were accustomed
1:51:43
to dealing with a lot of people.
1:51:45
My uncles, for example, worked in a lot of places where they were the
1:51:49
only African-American there, but like my one uncle, Clarence, they invited
1:51:55
all kinds of people to the house.
1:51:57
Because they already had a house full of people, adding one or two
1:52:01
more didn’t make a difference.
1:52:02
So, but for some people the adjustment is more difficult.
1:52:05
I guess the way they grew up, sort of thing.
1:52:09
And me, I don’t worry about some things because I feel that my experiences
1:52:16
are such that human beings are human beings and I don’t worry about it.
1:52:20
What I do is try to do my own thing and to enjoy people.
1:52:26
I don’t see—the bottom line, when I’m traveling, most of the time if I’m sitting
1:52:31
next to someone, I’ll start a conversation with him even if he doesn’t like to talk.
1:52:35
And my wife, she says, “Will, shut up!” [laughs] But so,
1:52:40
most people aren’t like that.
1:52:42
So the kids who come who are not what I would call aggressively outgoing people;
1:52:48
they need a shoulder, or someone who has at least an experience similar to theirs.
1:52:55
But I’m just very aggressive and I love people, so being here didn’t bother me,
1:52:59
and I was in the chemistry department.
1:53:01
My instruction load the first years, I didn’t have time to worry about
1:53:04
what the place was like, you know getting all those lectures ready and
1:53:08
also looking out on the class there.
1:53:13
I was teaching three professional and one undergrad course, and
1:53:16
it was about 225 students.
1:53:18
I looked out, I didn’t see one Mediterranean head of
1:53:23
hair, you know what I mean?
1:53:25
Nobody with hair even that was brown like yours [refers to the interviewer’s long,
1:53:27
straight, brown hair] . You know so, I say now, like some puzzle we get in the
1:53:36
house, my daughter will say “This is very interesting!” [laughs] And here I am, a
1:53:40
ghetto kid, trying to teach these kids.
1:53:43
They were typical, perfect, you know, Northern European people.
1:53:48
And I had a lot of friends like that because I was at
1:53:50
Cornell, so I was no stranger.
1:53:52
But generally, you know, Cornell because it had Italians, you know,
1:53:56
and a lot of different ethnic groups.
1:53:58
But here, it was pretty homogeneous.
1:54:00
Now here [at OSU], it’s better, you know.
1:54:02
When I say “better” I mean you get to see different people but being here, for me:
1:54:09
I just like people, so it’s no problem.
1:54:11
And also if you have to instruct, some people have to come to you anyway, they’ve
1:54:14
got to get the papers, and you interact with students and especially the kids
1:54:19
like myself, from the ghetto, and they tell me, and I say, “Why did you come
1:54:24
to Oregon State?” And one little girl, she was actually from someplace small,
1:54:29
I forget. She said to me, “I wanted to go to a larger city.” [All laugh] Yes!
1:54:34
I tried not
1:54:37
to smile at this!
1:54:37
But I understood her: it [Corvallis] was large for her.
1:54:40
Tell us about your own family—sons, daughters?
1:54:40
What are they doing?
1:54:40
Did anyone follow in your footsteps?
1:54:40
I have one daughter, her name is Priscilla, and now
1:54:40
I have two grandchildren, one is named Maria [Marya?].
1:54:41
Marya is 14, and the boy is Serell [Cyril?] and he is 11.
1:54:42
He almost cries because I need to [be able to] see them at all
1:54:50
times [when I babysit].
1:54:50
He doesn’t like to stay still.
1:54:50
Now the girl, though, she’s good.
1:54:50
Her father, my son-in-law, he’s an artist.
1:54:50
She’s like my son-in-law, she’s very talented.
1:54:50
She’s a very good artist.
1:54:50
Where do they live?
1:54:50
WG: They live in Seattle, so I don’t see them every day.
1:54:50
What are you the proudest of?
1:54:51
What will others think is your greatest accomplishment?
1:54:54
Well, you know, because of where I grew up, and the way my mother and father
1:55:00
and parents are, the thing that I’m proudest of is that I was able to survive.
1:55:07
That I was able to adjust to things that were uncomfortable, that I
1:55:11
could retain those things which I had been taught all my life.
1:55:14
I didn’t care—people may think I’m stupid—but if somebody uh, chooses
1:55:21
you out and says they don’t like you and they don’t even know you,
1:55:26
they have nothing to base it on, I say that’s part of life.
1:55:29
And it has nothing to do with race per se because when you are in a
1:55:32
place like Flint, there are 20, 30 percent of the people were Black.
1:55:36
Just because they were Black didn’t mean you know, you were admitted by
1:55:39
them because you know some of them are
1:55:41
crooks!
1:55:41
[laughs]
1:55:41
So you know, when I say I came from a large family—and we were a family,
1:55:49
starting with our great-grandmother—and my great-grandmother, my wife is
1:55:55
about five one-and-a-half and she always tried to tell my wife she [my
1:55:59
great-grandmother] was tall as she [my wife] was, and even though she [my
1:56:00
wife] could almost look over her head.
1:56:03
She was about, I would say at the most four-eleven.
1:56:06
But she was like a little soldier and
1:56:11
my uncle is 6’4” now and my other uncle, he weighed two-sixty—when
1:56:14
she spoke, he listened!
1:56:17
So I learned that size and all that doesn’t matter.
1:56:20
Oh, and she was very fair—I must tell you this—she was very fair.
1:56:24
You wouldn’t say she was Caucasian, but she was fair [in complexion].
1:56:29
She was just like Mrs. Teti [in Ghana]; she had red hair.
1:56:31
But she was very fair and she was a tough little cookie and she was just very good.
1:56:36
So basically what I’m saying is that I grew up in a heterogeneous family;
1:56:42
I grew up with people who didn’t care about whether you were rich or poor.
1:56:46
My uncles they’re the ones rich anyway—we were just guys.
1:57:00
Besides I was too short to worry about whether somebody likes you
1:57:09
or not.
1:58:24
What
1:58:33
my dad
1:58:40
taught us was how to survive.
1:58:41
Don’t worry about, don’t choose your friends because somebody looks
1:58:45
like you or doesn’t look like you.
1:58:48
You try to make your way, and so that helped me here.
1:58:50
Because when I got here, I’d be looking around to see how many people looked
1:58:52
like me and when I looked out at my class, there was not one—there was no
1:58:57
Mediterranean, there was no one even with black hair—real black hair, not brown
1:59:01
hair, there was not one among my students!
1:59:04
But that didn’t worry me because I’d been
1:59:08
at Cornell and Cornell was a small town, there was a small Black population, but
1:59:13
there were people from all over the world.
1:59:15
So that’s the way I lived, and I have discovered that it doesn’t
1:59:19
matter who your friends are.
1:59:21
And the problem is I had a slew of angels.
1:59:23
I would not survive I believe, and people are hesitant, and I’m not talking about
1:59:29
spiritual angels, I’m talking about real angels—I wouldn’t be sitting here with
1:59:32
you if all those guys hadn’t reached out.
1:59:34
I was [indistinct] three times, three times, for a month at a time,
1:59:40
working in the lab, having lunch, and sitting at a table with people they
1:59:45
don’t know me but I know them—big prize winners and that sort of thing.
1:59:50
So you don’t get to those things because you are so brilliant and
1:59:53
all; you need someone to help you.
1:59:55
So I’ve got a lot of that—I’m proud of that.
1:59:56
A lot of people helped me.
1:59:57
You know, I’ll give you one example
2:00:03
here—A matter of several years ago, many years ago now
2:00:07
in the 60s, I wanted to go and learn all about computers—back then we were
2:00:12
doing a computer simulation, digital and analog, and I knew a guy, Tim,
2:00:19
they were in the Johnson Research Foundation [Eldridge Reaves Johnson
2:00:25
Foundation] and they were biochemists,
2:00:29
so I wanted to go there and of course I needed support to go.
2:00:34
I tell you that because it’s the best thing at Oregon State I think.
2:00:38
I had
2:00:40
a lot of guys whose reasons were sweet and beyond me that
2:00:43
have helped me to get around.
2:00:45
Now what happened is I applied for a grant to go, an IS grant to go and
2:00:50
do computer simulation at the Johnson Research Foundation at the University
2:00:55
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
2:00:57
And out of the blue this guy calls me and he says, “Look, I see you’re
2:01:02
applying to go and do a computer simulation, and I need to know about
2:01:10
your grant background.” I don’t
2:01:13
know how he knew to call me. And so I went through every math course I’d had
2:01:19
from kindergarten to 4A transformers.
2:01:23
He said, “That’s OK, but I need to have somebody there to verify that
2:01:27
you’ve been at the top of the math and you don’t have to do anything.”
2:01:30
And I didn’t have to do anything. So my friend Harry Goheen [verify] who
2:01:34
was a mathematician who was also into computers and he worked with a relay
2:01:37
[verify] machine, which is not a real computer, it’s just an imaginary computer.
2:01:43
So I called him up and he called the guy.
2:01:45
The next day the guy calls me back and he said, “You have the grant!” I said,
2:01:49
“Thank you!” And I did get the grant, and I did go to the University of
2:01:54
Pennsylvania to learn about computers.
2:01:55
But I tell you that story because 15 years later, after I had been to Penn
2:02:00
and considered myself knowledgeable about these things, I picked up the
2:02:05
Albany newspaper and on the front page was a picture of Harry Goheen who, I
2:02:12
told you, was a mathematician, was being honored as one of the seven founding
2:02:18
persons of the American Computer Society.
2:02:21
So I get a recommendation from the founder!
2:02:25
So
2:02:27
the end of the story is I see this and I say of course, he did give
2:02:34
me all kinds of tips and such, and showed me how to do things.
2:02:37
But I called his wife, Molly, I knew her well.
2:02:44
They both have passed now, but I said, “Molly, I’m looking at this
2:02:48
Democratic-Herald paper and Harry’s picture is on the front page.
2:02:52
It says he was one of the seven founding members of the American Computer
2:02:56
Society and he’s being honored!” I said, “Harry didn’t tell me!” And I tell
2:03:10
that story because I didn’t know he was one of those [founders].
2:03:13
He never told me.
2:03:15
But I have a lot of stories like that.
2:03:19
call them angels because they didn’t have to do that, you know?
2:03:22
And so I guess the NIH, the boss lady here, the lady I’m working with her
2:03:26
husband is the head of the whole unit I’m in—I didn’t know that when I went to work,
2:03:32
because I went to work for a colleague that was in the same unit she was.
2:03:36
And so my point is that I tell everyone the one thing that saved me and got me
2:03:42
a job and all that is always some angel.
2:03:44
I call them angels because they didn’t have to do it, and they are real.
2:03:48
And so when I can, I try to help anybody I can.
2:03:54
When looking back on your life, what were some of the turning points?
2:03:57
What direction did they lead you?
2:03:59
Oh, it’s simple.
2:04:01
“Turning points,” you call them.
2:04:03
Well, the first place, there were five children in my
2:04:06
family and I was the oldest.
2:04:10
The youngest one was 17 but there were in-between and
2:04:13
there was college coming up.
2:04:15
And so I always tried to do some things for myself.
2:04:20
The turning point was, there were several turning points.
2:04:23
One was
2:04:26
that I grew up in a family that stressed family and education.
2:04:35
If you didn’t do your homework, that great-grandmother I talked about
2:04:40
would have a few words with you.
2:04:44
I didn’t even realize the importance of that.
2:04:46
Now, I went to college.
2:04:47
When I went away for the first time in my life, I went from Flint to
2:04:51
Detroit, and I was not going to go home—I couldn’t go home every day.
2:04:56
And the turning point occurred during that period where I was very fortunate.
2:05:02
The first thing that happened to me was that I was going to be a chemistry major.
2:05:11
Only.
2:05:13
And I had to have a job.
2:05:14
Remember my dad said, if you are
2:05:23
sick you can go back home.
2:05:26
You either got to be in school or get a job.
2:05:28
And so I said, “How can I do something?” I loved chemistry, but you know I had
2:05:35
to have a license to get something.
2:05:36
So I decided also to major in the pharmacy program.
2:05:41
So I was a chemistry person—that was my heart—but if you had a
2:05:46
pharmacy degree, you can get a job.
2:05:48
That first Christmas, when I was working at the Post Office
2:05:51
as a temporary clerk, I’m
2:05:55
sitting beside three or four guys; three of them are Black, like me.
2:05:59
There were a lot of other people, a lot of guys were over there.
2:06:02
When I asked what they were going to do, they were all chemists.
2:06:05
They’re here, sitting here with me, making the same hourly wage I am, and
2:06:11
they said, “Well, we’ve been trying” and they’d been out of school a long
2:06:13
time, trying to get jobs, through DuPont and all the big chemistry places; they
2:06:18
just wouldn’t hire them. And so they were doing that until they could find
2:06:23
a spot to land. So I said, I know I’m going to keep my pharmacy [studies].
2:06:27
I went through the pharmacy program; I took
2:06:32
the tests, you know, to pass the state boards, practicum and all that.
2:06:36
I passed them.
2:06:37
I was licensed and then very, very soon Larry Schrader that I told you
2:06:42
about [VERIFY] knew a person that I knew too, but I didn’t know it.
2:06:46
He said to me that [NAME] who was a friend of mine, his father—because
2:06:51
we were always in the same classes, owns a series of drugstores, and if
2:06:55
I wanted to work and earn some money, they would give me a scholarship.
2:06:58
Because I needed extra money, because you know I came from five fellows and my
2:07:01
dad sent all his kids to go to college.
2:07:01
So he said
2:07:07
to talk to Flonori and I did because he was a pharmacy student like me
2:07:12
and he was getting his license, and I said, “Should I go someplace?”
2:07:14
and he said, “No, don’t worry.
2:07:17
My dad will give you a job.
2:07:18
You can work on the weekends—Saturday and Sunday.” That was beautiful for me because
2:07:24
I could set up my [chemistry] experiments on Friday, go in Saturday morning and make
2:07:28
sure it’s all right, then come back at the end of the day and go back to the job.
2:07:33
And I was making more money as a pharmacist than I was
2:07:38
getting from my scholarships.
2:07:39
When
2:07:42
I said that that was a turning point?
2:07:43
Is because I would not have done that—the pharmacy thing—unless
2:07:52
I was able to.
2:07:54
And it was just that Flonori’s parents owned a drug store and
2:07:58
they gave me a job and I worked and I was making pharmacy wages.
2:08:02
I was a licensed pharmacist.
2:08:03
Now I didn’t tell you one important thing.
2:08:08
One was I decided to do the pharmacy.
2:08:10
And then didn’t go and work at it right away.
2:08:15
My dad said to me, “How much does an assistant professor in biochemistry
2:08:20
make?” This is way back before both of you were born—this was in ’55.
2:08:26
And I said, “An assistant professor at Wayne State University in the chemistry
2:08:30
department is making $5,500 a year.” And he said to me—my mom was at the table—he
2:08:36
said, “Look” and he named a guy who was the chief of the hospital pharmacy
2:08:42
and everything in the Hurley Hospital.
2:08:45
My dad was like a politician, so he knew this person, and he had talked to him.
2:08:51
“He told me he would give you a job, because you are finishing up and he
2:08:53
will give you a job and you can do like a residency with him and he will give
2:08:58
you a job permanently.” And he said to me, “You’re going to tell me you
2:09:03
want to go to school four more years and these people are now making $5,500
2:09:08
a year as assistant professors, and you’re going to be a biochemist, and my
2:09:13
friend is going to pay you $6,500 now!
2:09:18
A year, with this license!” I should add, they are starting for $80,000 now—I’ve
2:09:24
never made $80,000 in my life, if I add them all up [laughs] --$80 thousand!
2:09:30
Forget it.
2:09:30
So you see, turning points.
2:09:32
So that was my big turning point.
2:09:35
Otherwise I’d have probably been still in Flint working [as a pharmacist].
2:09:38
Then when I took, got the degree it was a turning point because
2:09:42
it allowed me to do other things other than work at the university.
2:09:46
I could get to NIH three times, and all that.
2:09:49
And they give you
2:09:52
the salary right there.
2:09:54
So those are my turning points.
2:09:56
But I don’t regret any of it.
2:10:00
I don’t look back and say I should have done this or that.
2:10:04
The thing that I am most happy about is that I survived!
2:10:12
I always knew two things—I couldn’t go back home and I kept
2:10:17
that pharmacy license in front of
2:10:22
me [laughs] . I kept it up, I kept taking the tests, I kept paying my fees and that
2:10:29
through all the time through grad school.
2:10:30
Because in grad school I’m doing that because I love it, but when
2:10:34
I got out of here, my salary was, when I came here was what—$6,200.
2:10:42
And the pharmacy guys were making a whole lot more than that.
2:10:45
But this is what I wanted to do.
2:10:47
And fortunately for me, everybody—including my dad—he tries to
2:10:52
be tough, but he means it when he tells you that I’m not going to let you do it.
2:10:56
But he never tried to hold it against me because I went on
2:10:59
and did what I wanted to do.
2:11:01
And what I’m saying is that it made a difference in my life.
2:11:07
You’re not going to be rich anyway—I don’t know anybody in my family who’s
2:11:09
ever gotten rich, and so I just do what I like to do and that’s it.
2:11:13
Do you remember the Henry Gates incident last summer?
2:11:13
WG: Yes, I remember it well.
2:11:13
Yes, I remember it very well.
2:11:13
Do you think they handled that well?
2:11:13
WG: Well, here’s the, I mean I’ll give you my answer.
2:11:13
In the first place, I don’t have the same attitude that Gates does.
2:11:13
I don’t have the same attitude as a lot of people.
2:11:13
Like I said I grew up with people from everywhere.
2:11:13
It was that time, you know.
2:11:13
I was in school.
2:11:13
There were a lot of rules that they made but all the kids
2:11:13
found ways to break those rules.
2:11:13
People from different parts of the world, they like to maintain their
2:11:13
ethnicity, so but the kids don’t care, you know what I mean: we were kids.
2:11:13
So I’m going to tell you about that Gates thing.
2:11:13
See, in the first place, let me tell you a little about myself and then
2:11:13
you’ll see why I have this idea.
2:11:13
Look, if you go around worrying about what the people say and what they do, you, you
2:11:13
are going to be in a world of trouble.
2:11:13
If you go around not liking someone—even, whoever it is, no matter whether
2:11:13
you are green, blue, yellow, white, or black—just because of one thing
2:11:13
they did, that’s crazy, you know.
2:11:13
And so my feeling about his incident is that neither side handled it very well.
2:11:13
But Gates has been Black all of his life!
2:11:13
You know, he wasn’t born Caucasian and people thought he was Black, you know.
2:11:13
[laughs] He has been Black all of his life.
2:11:13
But now he’s a Harvard professor.
2:11:13
Now Harvard, they have this attitude—and rightly so—they are good!
2:11:13
You don’t get there unless you’re good.
2:11:13
But there are people who are good in a lot of places, they may just have
2:11:13
chosen to be in that place, you know.
2:11:13
What happened was, two things that happened: when they came to his
2:11:13
house and accused him of something, he should have just let them speak.
2:11:13
And he should have tried to, carefully, when they asked him questions, simply
2:11:13
say, “You know it is my house, but of course your job is to find out if it’s
2:11:13
really my house. And therefore, I can do whatever you want me to do now, but
2:11:13
I can also call my supervisors, and let you call them and you check and they will
2:11:13
tell you that it really is my house. But if you don’t have time for that, go ahead
2:11:13
with whatever you want me to do now.
2:11:13
We can do it.
2:11:13
I’ll sign anything you want me to sign.”
2:11:13
But what he did was try to remember unnecessarily that he was Black and
2:11:13
secondly that he was a Harvard professor.
2:11:13
So he was upset because, and it wasn’t fair—it was based on something that
2:11:13
somebody who had never seen him did.
2:11:13
You can’t run your life by, if you think you are going to get all fair treatment,
2:11:13
I don’t care if you’re blue, black, or green, you are not going to get it.
2:11:13
So he made that strategic error and the policeman who made the error of trying
2:11:13
to get—now I wasn’t there—but his error was that he should have explained to him.
2:11:13
But both of them were letting their egos show.
2:11:13
Policeman thinks he’s authority and Gates thinks he’s in authority
2:11:13
because he’s a Harvard professor.
2:11:13
But they don’t care if you’re a millionaire, if a policeman stops you in a
2:11:13
car to give you a ticket, keep your mouth shut, take your ticket, and drive off.
2:11:13
Or what I always do, I say for example, I’ll give you an
2:11:13
example of a strategic error.
2:11:13
I was driving down—where was it—Harrison, and I passed 25th there.
2:11:13
The light popped “caution” just as I got to the intersection.
2:11:13
I couldn’t tell if there was anybody, so I just ran on through.
2:11:13
I saw the police car, it was there.
2:11:13
So they came later, and they came there.
2:11:13
I knew they were going to stop me because they were waiting right there.
2:11:13
I just passed through, the light wasn’t red when I started, but then
2:11:13
I could see that it was turning red, but I couldn’t tell for sure—it
2:11:13
was night, so I couldn’t tell.
2:11:14
So anyway, long story short is that they waited to stop me.
2:11:14
I got almost down to King’s and I saw the [blue flashing] light, and I pulled over.
2:11:14
And he said, “You ran through a light,” and I said, “Yes, I did, but I didn’t
2:11:14
have time to see if anybody was behind me.
2:11:14
So I looked up quickly and I couldn’t tell, so I knew that I was running through
2:11:14
that caution light as it turned red.” And I told him that was why I did it.
2:11:14
And I said, “You know what you saw. And would you like to see my license?” And
2:11:14
he said, “Can I see your license?” And I showed him my license. And he looked at
2:11:14
and he gave it back to me, and he looked up and he said to me, he said, “OK,
2:11:14
you can go now.” And so, I did, I left.
2:11:14
But I knew that he wasn’t just going to take my word, that I said that.
2:11:14
He could judge.
2:11:14
He waited until and then I saw they were pulling out.
2:11:14
So from that point on, I drove extremely carefully.
2:11:14
They followed me for awhile from way back—I knew they were following me.
2:11:14
I didn’t even go home, I just drove, and then pretty soon they stopped
2:11:14
following me, and I went home.
2:11:14
Now the reason I give you this example is, what he [Gates] did was to try to
2:11:14
impress a police officer with who he was!
2:11:14
The police officer did not care who he was!
2:11:14
And when he mentioned, he was a Harvard professor, that police officer was
2:11:14
working in Cambridge, so I’m sure that he was not the first Harvard
2:11:14
professor that he had encountered.
2:11:14
You know what I mean?
2:11:14
He’s just a police officer, you’re a Harvard professor?
2:11:14
He’s stopping me, give me a break!
2:11:14
So, that’s what he did.
2:11:14
And he [Gates], he got upset, and he was saying something which you cannot
2:11:14
ever prove—that the policeman treated him that way because he was Black.
2:11:14
See, I don’t know where Gates grew up, but he can never do
2:11:14
that—he can never prove it!
2:11:14
And what, you don’t care if he stops you because you’re Black anyway!
2:11:14
It doesn’t change anything.
2:11:14
What he’s doing is [the policeman], is doing what he wants to do
2:11:14
and what he thinks is right.
2:11:14
I never saw that policeman before or heard about him doing this, but I grew
2:11:14
up around in a city where a lot of police stop you just to check you out.
2:11:14
See if you have got an appropriate driver’s license.
2:11:14
I never argued with them, and fine.
2:11:14
And when they finished, I said, “Is that it? Can I go?” and they would
2:11:14
usually say, “Yeah, you can go now.” You haven’t done anything, and they’re
2:11:14
not looking for you. So he’s projecting.
2:11:14
Now it doesn’t mean that he’s not right in the sense that it was his house.
2:11:14
But if that policeman knew that and believed him, he wouldn’t
2:11:14
have had any trouble at all.
2:11:14
When you see the guy doesn’t believe you, then you just let
2:11:14
him give you a ticket or you say, “Would you like to have my license?
2:11:14
Would you like to check with some people who know that this is my
2:11:14
house?” But he didn’t do that.
2:11:14
He was indignant because the guy was treating him the way he did.
2:11:14
But that’s stupid.
2:11:14
That’s really stupid.
2:11:14
I’m sorry to say, that’s really stupid.
2:11:14
If Rockefeller came in here now, and we didn’t know it was Rockefeller, we would
2:11:14
treat him just like any other student.
2:11:14
You know what I mean?
2:11:14
We wouldn’t make any special allowances.
2:11:14
Now, but if I knew he was Rockefeller, and head of a foundation, and he
2:11:14
came into my class, I’d say, “Come in Mr. or Mrs. Rockefeller! Help
2:11:14
us!” [laughs] You know what I mean?
2:11:14
But if it was anybody, I’d treat them the same way because
2:11:14
I don’t know who they are.
2:11:14
This is a classroom, and we’re not just allowed to let anyone in.
2:11:14
“Would you like to sit?
2:11:14
It’s my lecture, if you’d like to sit, fine, take a seat.” But
2:11:14
my point is: that’s what he did wrong, and he still is not over it!
2:11:14
This is stupid.
2:11:14
I don’t know where he grew up, but sometimes you have a heightened
2:11:14
visibility and the police stop me for that reason—that’s his job.
2:11:14
He didn’t say that I was crook when they stopped me or, he just
2:11:14
said that I ran through the light and I knew it was the truth!
2:11:14
So, I was going to say you saw what you saw.
2:11:14
And that’s fine.
2:11:14
What Gates did wrong.
2:11:14
I don’t care who you are.
2:11:14
It could have been a case like Detroit, and it could have happened with a
2:11:14
Black police officer, because they don’t like you talking back to them
2:11:14
anyway and they don’t care whether you are blue, green, or black—“I’m
2:11:14
the police officer and you can’t do a thing!” So that’s my short, long-winded
2:11:14
answer. But I just know that he made a strategic error and I’m not surprised.
2:11:14
I’ve seen him on TV before; he gives lectures.
2:11:14
He’s living in a pseudo-world.
2:11:14
The only thing that would’ve stopped them is if he’s said he was J.D. Rockefeller.
2:11:14
Of the Rockefeller Foundation.
2:11:14
He might have stopped then, because that’s money.
2:11:14
But if he’d have said he’s Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon at Cambridge Hospital,
2:11:14
they would have respected [him], but they would still do the same thing.
2:11:14
If there were power, they’d have paid attention.
2:11:14
What I do is I overwhelm them with cooperation.
2:11:14
Really, you know he [the police officer] saw me turn around and I didn’t, you
2:11:14
know you have to turn around, I made a mistake by the hospital up on Harrison
2:11:14
and I passed it, then I backed into the driveway and I turned around and went
2:11:14
back to the hospital, so when he [the police officer] came and he stopped
2:11:14
me, and he said, “You made a U-turn.” I said, “Yes, I did make a U-turn but
2:11:14
I did back up,” and he asked me why.
2:11:14
And I told him just what I told you, and I didn’t say anything more.
2:11:14
I said, “I did really make that turn, and I did back up, you probably couldn’t
2:11:14
see it.” And he didn’t say anything and pretty soon he checked in, he said
2:11:14
something to me, he checked my driver’s license and all that and then said, “OK.”
2:11:14
And I said, “Is that it?” And he said, “Yeah, you can go.” So he let me go.
2:11:14
See, you can’t do that all the time but you just can’t win.
2:11:14
You cannot win.
2:11:14
If this guy is a police officer, you think he’s going to drive all
2:11:14
the way and tell you he saw you do something and now do nothing!
2:11:14
[laughs] . He’s at least going to ask you something.
2:11:14
You cannot live in a heterogeneous place and you happen to stick out.
2:11:14
It’s like in the classroom, in the music classroom, I have a loud
2:11:14
voice as you probably can tell.
2:11:14
And the music instructor, she uses the instrument and part of the music
2:11:14
program, and we were playing in there.
2:11:14
But the teacher used to go out—and this is a female teacher—and she comes
2:11:14
back and says, “Mr. Gamble.” When she says “mister” you know you’re
2:11:14
in trouble! [laughs] She said, “Were you talking?” I started to say no.
2:11:15
I said, “Yeah, I was talking, but everybody else was talking.” She
2:11:15
said, “Is your name ‘everybody else’?” [laughs] Then I shut up.
2:11:15
But what I’m saying to you is that just because you think you didn’t
2:11:15
do anything wrong, she [the music teacher] had told us not to play
2:11:15
unless you practicing something.
2:11:15
But I’m hard-headed about that stuff, so before I spoke, I played
2:11:15
a few notes, just ad libbing.
2:11:15
And it was really a part of a song—but what her rule was, was that if she caught
2:11:15
you doing that, she would ask you, “you better write it.” So she didn’t say
2:11:15
that to the other students, but she said, I took this paper of mine, and
2:11:15
you write whatever you were playing.
2:11:15
I had to work on that because I could hardly remember what I was playing.
2:11:15
So I guess my answer to you about that is that it’s not a perfect world.
2:11:15
You just take some lumps, but if they, now if they are serious lumps, then you
2:11:15
have to get someone who has authority to help you get around the lumps.
2:11:15
But other than that, you can’t, you just can’t go around thinking people are
2:11:15
necessarily going to treat you fairly.
2:11:15
And then most people do.
2:11:15
Which is the main thing that I have discovered in my life.
2:11:15
When you are in a certain place and people know you need help, my own
2:11:15
experience is that sometimes almost more than one person will help you!
2:11:15
And if you wait long enough, one person will help you.
2:11:15
I’ve had many times—like if your car is stopped over there in eastern
2:11:15
Oregon, that’s a serious thing.
2:11:15
You know, I’m a city boy and the first time I drove, when I looked at my map,
2:11:15
and I was coming for the first time to live here, I looked and I was in Burns,
2:11:15
and I couldn’t see, I didn’t see anything, let alone if there was a gas station.
2:11:15
And a guy said, “That is a service station but you won’t need it because
2:11:15
I’m going to give you gas.” I said, “But what if your car breaks down
2:11:15
between here and, you know, Bend?
2:11:15
What if your car breaks down?” He said, “Don’t worry, someone will help
2:11:15
you.” I said [laughs] “Are you kidding?
2:11:15
I’m from Flint, Michigan.” He looked at me.
2:11:15
If my car is still able to keep moving, I am not stopping to get any gas.
2:11:15
He said, “Nothing is going to happen: this is Oregon.” I said, “Sir, I appreciate
2:11:15
your instructions and everything, but I cannot stop.” And I didn’t have
2:11:15
even a phone or anything with me.
2:11:15
“I will not stop unless my car stops.” And that’s silly, but that’s the
2:11:15
way we operated in Michigan. Because 99 times out of 10 there are good
2:11:17
people, but sometimes there’s a crook.
2:11:17
And there’s your fatal times, especially in a place like Flint.
2:11:17
Right now I don’t know what they do, I don’t know how people can live
2:11:17
there because this is dangerous.
2:11:17
A lot of people are breaking into houses and all—it is really bad.
2:11:17
Anything you would like to add?
2:11:18
Did we miss anything?
2:11:19
No,
2:11:23
I’ll just say, I’m happy just being with you.
2:11:26
I love people and I hope I didn’t take too much of your time.
2:11:30
But I want to give you something that I did with respect to my area and if
2:11:39
I can have your names now and tell me where I can locate you, I would rather
2:11:44
bring it to you because it’s late now.
2:11:46
I don’t know if I have them here; they may be at home now.
2:11:48
The reason I want you to see this is because it will tell you how it relates
2:11:52
to all I’ve said here and you’ll see what I’m doing now and what I did.
2:11:57
But I think that to have what we were taught, and we had lots of friends—from
2:12:05
every kind of group you want to be with—that all human beings are human.
2:12:10
We all have our flaws.
2:12:12
And you should pick your friends based on people who you have something in
2:12:15
common with and that you like to hang out
2:12:21
with.
2:12:21
The street where I lived was like the United Nations.
2:12:23
We had Armenian people; we had Croatian people [on
2:12:34
our street].
2:12:34
We had someone from Togo, and his parents just were rich, and he happened to be
2:12:39
in Michigan because they were diplomats.
2:12:40
He was a good friend of
2:12:44
mine.
2:12:44
So we had a
2:12:50
time
2:12:58
of
2:13:06
meeting people and I like people.
2:13:09
I don’t regret anything I’ve done with respect to education
2:13:15
or that sort of thing.
2:13:17
Sometimes I open my big mouth and say something I shouldn’t have said, and
2:13:20
I regret those, but other than that
2:13:26
it’s just in our family.
2:13:27
I tell you, when I first took my wife—we met in college and I took her home
2:13:31
to visit, now this is my folks, not my father’s, but my mother’s folks.
2:13:36
She knew because my father’s family, they were in other parts of
2:13:41
Michigan and they knew her family.
2:13:44
That’s how I first met her when they were having some things.
2:13:48
I didn’t, I wasn’t, I was too young to worry about it then—I was trying
2:13:52
to stay alive and go to school.
2:13:53
But anyway, what I’m saying is
2:13:57
that
2:14:00
growing up and coming to a place like this was a great thing for
2:14:05
me because I had to adjust and I had to not worry about whether the
2:14:10
people were what or which or that.
2:14:13
And so far, as I said, we survived.
2:14:17
That’s all you can worry about.
2:14:19
And I will tell you about some of my work and I will get you before you go
2:14:24
and where I can bring it to you, I may have it here but I won’t look for it now.
2:14:29
I’ll just bring it to you.
2:14:30
It’s a couple of papers, and it’s simple.
2:14:33
I think I’ll give you one that I wrote for my children, too.
2:14:36
It’s about what I
2:15:38
do.
