00:03
Alright.
00:04
Today's date is February 6, 2019, and my name is Natalia Fernández.
00:12
This is an oral history interview with Bryant Everett in Corvallis,
00:15
Oregon, for the OSU History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:21
America Oral History Project.
00:23
To begin, please state your name and spell it aloud.
00:27
So my name is Bryant Everett, B-R-Y-A-N-T, and Everett, E-V-E-R-E-T-T.
00:34
And please share which pronouns you use.
00:37
I use or prefer she-her pronouns, but I also accept they-them pronouns.
00:44
So to begin, please share where and when you were born.
00:49
So, I mean, just up the road here in Corvallis, there's Goods American
00:53
Hospital, and on December 6th of 1986, I was born basically up the road.
01:02
From there I grew up mostly in Philomath, which is an itty-bitty
01:06
logging town not too far from here, and just, yeah, that's what that is.
01:13
And can you share a little bit about your family history, your parents?
01:19
I would love to.
01:23
So my parents are very interesting.
01:27
My father is of predominantly German descent.
01:31
He's six foot two and towers above everyone.
01:35
Maybe he's six four.
01:37
Anyways, but then additionally, my mom is Chinese, and she stands
01:41
at about four foot ten or so.
01:45
Just from their varied backgrounds it was very interesting growing up.
01:50
My mom is for, most intents and purposes, she is traditional
01:55
Chinese in a lot of ways.
01:58
Her parents were as well and we've only been on her side of the family has only
02:04
been in the country for, I will be the fourth generation; my mom the third.
02:10
So there's a whole set of very interesting stories that go along with that including
02:18
[name] , my great grandmother, who came over, and if you put two quarters together
02:24
that was the size of her feet when she came over as a full-grown adult female.
02:30
So there's a lot of cultural heritage that goes into that and sort of creates
02:35
sort of a framework for my mother and how we'll discuss her going forward.
02:40
Then my father, born in Eugene, Oregon, made it so that he grew up in kind of the
02:49
culture that's around here as it's evolved as time has gone on and went here to
02:54
Oregon State himself before getting some decent paying jobs over at Hewlett Packard
03:00
and doing all sorts of other things.
03:03
But there are a lot of different factors towards them and their descent that
03:08
sort of flavored my childhood, I suppose is the best way that I could put that.
03:14
Both in the sense of my mom's preconceived ideas of what, for the sake of this
03:21
interview, what gender is, how to interact with it, and how she sees the world.
03:27
And then my father has a much more broad viewpoint and interacts with all sorts of
03:33
different cultures and people and not only ethnicities, but sexualities, et cetera,
03:38
and is, I would say, a very good proponent of some advancements in that way.
03:45
So what was life for you growing up as a child?
03:51
Let's see.
03:53
There are a whole bunch of things that we could touch on, right?
03:58
I’m perfectly willing to expand on any of these points.
04:02
Let's throw them out there quickly and then we'll figure them out from there.
04:07
So there's growing up as a child 12 miles away from here up in the
04:12
forest being relatively secluded and cut off from both social groups
04:17
and cities and people, creating sort of that isolationism situation
04:23
especially as a child is fantastic.
04:27
You spend parts of your summers exploring the woods and just going off and
04:32
adventuring and exploring and doing all these things, but then if you ever want
04:37
to hang out with friends or do anything like that you're kind of limited in who
04:43
you can spend time with and if you've made friends through school etc., they're
04:48
half an hour away by car, which makes things kind of difficult sometimes.
04:55
But
04:57
growing up has a lot of different parts to it, right.
05:04
Besides the early parts that I remember first memories and the family that
05:11
I had, there's parts that have to do with very early beginning to see
05:19
issues between my parents and their relationship kind of falling apart.
05:23
I recall basically around the time that I was eight there being
05:28
some tension there and me not necessarily knowing what that is.
05:31
Around the time that I’m 12, you start sort of understanding what
05:35
that is and there's sort of a blanket and sort of oppressive, just
05:43
latent anger between them and how they interact and what that sort of
05:48
does to you as a child, especially.
05:51
I can look back on these things and I can voice it in this way, but in the time, I
05:56
would say things I was kind of scared when I was eight when my mom would get angry.
06:01
I recall all sorts of different anger explosions when things would happen,
06:08
where she could do something, like I described, she's this four foot
06:12
ten very small petite Chinese lady.
06:16
I recall her in anger picking up my dad's recliner and throwing it and that's just
06:24
like, you're a small kid and you're like, “that's really heavy!” and it's just
06:32
these moments of fear that really stick with you and when you start thinking
06:37
back on your life, you're able to take out these moments and sort of see them.
06:42
I remember going on family trips, and some of them were very nice.
06:47
Some of them were a little weird, and I didn't necessarily know why.
06:53
But as you sort of grow and get a little bit more emotionally cognizant,
06:58
you can start seeing where some of those issues are and what they are.
07:02
And then obviously there's going to school in a relatively small town in general.
07:09
So being a kid growing up in a town of, I think Philomath is like 5,000 people.
07:17
But my high school, as an example, had 600 students total.
07:21
And so the small-town atmosphere of everyone knowing everybody plays a large
07:27
role in how you interact with groups and society as you're going through.
07:32
When that, oh, that person is directly connected to this person who knows
07:39
these people, and you're only a few degrees of separation from your parents
07:43
finding out about anything you do or people talking or seeing what you do.
07:49
And if you stand out in any sort of way in a small-town
07:53
situation, everybody knows it.
07:56
So can you talk a little bit more about your school experience?
08:00
And you've begun to share that a little bit, but did you find support,
08:04
community in school or not as much?
08:07
I was going to say that's it's a half-half, right.
08:12
A lot of the connections that I have from school, I still
08:16
have, and I value very highly.
08:18
I’m able to openly talk to people who were in my high school, friends
08:23
that I’ve had since middle school.
08:24
I’m still in contact with quite a few people that I met in kindergarten.
08:28
On the support side, yes.
08:32
That exists.
08:33
Whether it was the main predominating or the main predominant thing that I
08:37
remember from it, not necessarily, and there's a lot of different parts of that.
08:42
Elementary school when you're just trying to figure yourself out and
08:45
you're going up there, I don't have a lot of memories of that, to be fair.
08:52
For large life events, like I was in, I think it was fourth
08:56
grade, and our house burnt down.
08:59
So living way out in the woods for the entire time that I’m growing
09:03
up in fourth grade which puts us at, what is that ten or so?
09:10
And it burning down and then for most of my middle school career I actually
09:14
got to live in town and be one of those kids on the cul-de-sac that rode their
09:19
bikes and interacted with people in that sort of way and it made it more readily
09:25
accessible that I could do extracurricular activities, sports, different clubs, and
09:30
things that until, of course, in my early high school career we ended up rebuilding
09:37
the house and moving back out there.
09:39
So it's interesting towards what sort of support that I felt, right?
09:48
So in eighth grade, I was part of and always took part in soccer.
09:57
I ended up getting into cheerleading, theater, and all sorts of other
10:02
extracurricular activities because as a general thing for me as a person,
10:07
I really like to learn things.
10:09
And if I am able to put myself out there and be able to learn something through a
10:13
conversation, through doing something that may be a little bit weird, I typically
10:18
take that step and take that leap.
10:21
But it's interesting on the note of support being able to talk about the fact
10:28
that while I was in high school, the GSA,
10:31
the Gay-Straight Alliance, came under attack from the group that held one of
10:41
the largest, I suppose, scholarships that was offered to people who grew up in rural
10:47
communities and that's part of Oregon,
10:51
the Clemens Foundation.
10:53
Every student who graduated from any of the schools, Philomath and I think Kings
10:59
Valley and a lot of other small towns, there was a tuition of OSU equivalent
11:05
scholarship that was offered for every term for four years, which really
11:10
allowed people who were college-minded or wanted to go to college to just be
11:16
able to know financially they could.
11:18
All you had to do was graduate.
11:21
And I thought that that was an amazing thing.
11:23
But then in my high school career, there was a drastic shift in how it was tended
11:32
and how it was seen and who controlled it, that you could no longer go to Oregon
11:38
State [University] , as an example.
11:40
It was prioritized towards the top 10 Christian schools in America and
11:48
the entire thoughts around it changed in such a drastic way that an open letter
11:55
was given by somebody who was directly attached to that foundation that called
12:00
out the teachers who were organizing the GSA and by name named some of the head
12:07
students within the GSA as communist and just this letter full of vitriol and
12:15
negative connotations about they're being terrible people and they're spreading
12:20
these ideas and concepts, especially towards gender and sexuality openness,
12:25
that is corrosive to our society.
12:28
It was such a hit to anybody who existed in the community at the time,
12:35
just because it really made students reticent to join that organization.
12:42
Can you, if you're looking at going to college, can you be a
12:47
part of an organization that that group who holds that scholarship?
12:53
Can you be part of an organization that they hate, and will that negatively
12:57
impact your ability to go to college?
13:01
And then there was just sort of general organizational concern
13:07
raised because there became a little bit of fighting back and forth in
13:11
some form or another, and to see
13:17
teachers, especially some of them, because like I said small community, small
13:20
town, begin to distance themselves from that organization, to see the students
13:26
begin to distance themselves from that organization for whatever reason, sort
13:31
of dwindled that organization into a relative state of non-existence.
13:36
So as an early teen who's trying to figure out for themselves what their
13:42
sexuality is, how they want to present gender-wise, to just have that completely
13:47
fall apart and obliterate in that short period of time was just like,
13:55
“oh”.
13:56
Whether I necessarily thought about it in those terms at that time, no.
14:01
But was I angry?
14:02
Absolutely.
14:04
So taking a step back, in middle school, were you thinking about
14:09
your sense of self and these issues?
14:11
Was there support there?
14:13
Or was it in high school with the GSA that then you began to find community?
14:18
Can you share a little bit about your journey in terms of finding yourself?
14:21
Absolutely.
14:23
So I recall, I think it's the best way to put it, I recall being
14:33
14, I’ll throw this out there as well.
14:36
In late middle school, I was sexually abused by a gentleman who was a
14:43
neighbor way out in the boonies.
14:45
And that really adjusted my sense of me, who I was, because
14:55
of that sexual assault, right?
14:59
I had a lot of questions about sort of the person that I was.
15:04
It shook everything up in a sense of, you have this preconceived notion of
15:08
who you are, and something like this happens that just drastically destroys
15:14
some of the foundational feelings you have, not necessarily towards
15:19
yourself, but maybe security, how secure you are in your gender identity
15:24
and I know from a very real sense as
15:32
part of and looking at sexual assault, there is a lot of problems for the victim
15:41
where you're like, I enjoyed certain parts of this and what does that say about me?
15:46
And so that threw a huge wrench into the concept of I had for myself and
15:53
that was at the time that I was 14 or
15:57
so.
15:57
I began to very actively question who I was, what I was doing, how I
16:03
wanted to be going forward, because the entire conception that I had for
16:07
myself was in a lot of ways shattered
16:12
-- towards the point of the question, right?
16:17
I had an inkling directly at that time that I would have much, or I would
16:23
have much preferred to present female.
16:27
I didn't know that transgender was a thing, especially in that day and age.
16:33
And there wasn't any way to sort of describe or anyone that
16:38
I could really talk to sort of get those thoughts out there.
16:41
And then secondarily, because of the nature of who I am and how I
16:45
view the world, I very much was like, Bryant, you're an idiot.
16:51
You're 14.
16:52
You don't know a goddamn thing.
16:56
That's not a decision that you can make for yourself right now.
17:01
So I started to experiment, both with myself, my gender, my sexuality, how I
17:07
presented and every I think six months to a year until my mid-20s, I would
17:14
drastically reinvent myself: who I was, how I presented, how I dressed, how I
17:21
looked, who I spent time with, what I did, in this longer-term search of, who am I?
17:31
And I will say that that continues even today, as I’m going through different
17:36
things, looking at if I can challenge some of these conceptions of who I am, and what
17:44
can I give up if this isn't helpful to me, is this something that I can do away
17:48
with is, if this is something that I think is positive, can I move towards that?
17:55
But back to your question: Yes, especially in that middle school and early childhood
18:01
area, I was really questioning who I was, how I could present, and what I thought
18:09
my place in the world was, that I, for quite a while, identified as openly gay.
18:19
I did things that I would necessarily say I was doing to try and find an in-group.
18:27
I will say that I pitched up since middle school just for vocal purposes.
18:33
I wanted to be less threatening towards people in general.
18:36
[Everett changes voice pitch to sound deeper] But the reality is when you are
18:41
looking at different ways that you can present, your voice and how you project
18:47
it and how you talk to people directly [Everett returns to using their previous
18:50
voice pitch] can have a huge impact on how you're perceived in any sort of
18:56
just general purpose examination of it.
19:00
So I had a really long period of time of just: no that doesn't fit, no that
19:07
doesn't fit, no that doesn't fit.
19:12
And I definitely took away a lot of positives from all of the groups that I
19:17
actively identified with or worked with or talked to and all these connections
19:22
and people and broaden this scope.
19:26
But at the same time, it wasn't until I basically reached my end of my
19:33
20s into my early 30s when I figured out, hey, transgender is a thing.
19:39
In the conceptions that I have for myself, that much better fits towards
19:44
what I’m feeling and how I want to present to the world in general.
19:49
So you mentioned that you didn't have anyone to speak to.
19:53
So the abuse that you suffered, did you ever share that eventually
19:57
with your parents, with other members of the community, or not?
20:03
So I did, but I will say it wasn't
20:09
a thing that was just me.
20:13
So the person who perpetrated that sexual abuse did so against not only
20:20
myself, but also to a lot of other younger boys in that sort of age
20:26
group and that sort of area, that eventually they got caught and it became
20:34
something that police action was taken.
20:38
So my parents knew.
20:42
And they reacted very differently to what that was and how that was, right.
20:50
So no, I didn't really have a lot of support and even if I put up a decent
20:58
emotional barrier against whatever it was, how it made me feel, and what
21:06
the sexual abuse actually was, right?
21:10
I know that one of my parents was incredibly angry and just like,
21:14
we need to do something we need to press charges this is something
21:17
that we need to do and this is ugh.
21:19
And then I had another parent who was slow down: the thing that matters most is
21:25
how does Bryant want to deal with this?
21:27
How do they see this affecting them going forward and put the focus back
21:33
on me directly, and I’ll be honest as a 14-year-old that's having this
21:39
happen to them, I was incredibly just like, I don't want to think about this.
21:46
I don't want this to be a large part of my life.
21:48
I don't want people to know that this is a large part of what formed who I am.
21:56
I don't know necessarily if that was a mistake, right.
22:01
I think that now it's something that I can openly talk about with people, and I
22:08
found it as an incredibly good connective point with a lot of people who've
22:13
dealt with emotional and sexual trauma
22:18
and to be able to talk about it in honesty about how it made you feel,
22:28
using terms like “being taken advantage of” and “being held
22:32
down” and all of these things.
22:34
There are a lot of visceral imagery that I could use here about what
22:38
that was and finding support from that to deal with that is not
22:44
something that I personally did and
22:50
with one parent being incredibly angry and I want this to be a huge thing.
22:54
We need to make sure that this gets taken care of.
22:58
This person has to be taken to the end of the law.
23:02
That wasn't necessarily what I wanted, right.
23:05
And to have a second parent who was, “okay how can we help you?” This
23:10
is something that happened to you.
23:12
This is something that you're going to have to deal with.
23:17
And really, the second parent was my father, by the way.
23:24
I really liked the way that he handled that, just because it allowed me to have
23:31
some sort of control over the situation that I didn't have while it was happening.
23:36
And I didn't emotionally deal with it until, honestly, into my early
23:43
20s when I was in a much more stable emotional relationship with somebody
23:48
and being able to talk about that openly with them and sort of deal with the
23:52
emotional trauma that that put on me.
23:55
That didn't occur until my 20s,
24:01
but it's a difficult to be able to see and find emotional support
24:07
in that sort of way, especially if you're marginalized just by geography.
24:15
There isn't a lot of people that you can reach out to and there are
24:18
only these small windows where you necessarily feel comfortable being able
24:24
to talk about some of these things.
24:25
It is incredibly difficult to be as emotionally open and to discuss those
24:32
things with people, but I think it is incredibly important, especially at
24:36
the advent of things that are currently going on, especially at the lip of the
24:39
#MeToo Movement and all these things.
24:42
I think that it is incredibly important that we're able to have a
24:46
conversation about these things, but towards your question, no, I didn't
24:50
have a lot of support about it, but that's also partially because I didn't
24:54
necessarily want a lot of support on it.
25:02
So in high school with the GSA did you have a sense of what was
25:09
occurring on the broader state, national level of LGBTQ issues?
25:15
Where did you get your information?
25:16
How did you connect with the broader community?
25:19
Did you or didn't you and why not?
25:23
There's quite a few things that happened while I was in high school.
25:27
I’ll throw it out there.
25:29
September 11th occurred while I was a freshman or sophomore in high school.
25:35
And whether it directly affected me personally, minimally, right?
25:41
But towards, looking at LGBTQ
25:48
issues, no, I really did not know that much.
25:53
I was not all that involved in the community in any sort of way, even
26:00
though I was questioning for myself.
26:04
I saw it as a very, a personal journey and even if I did do some searching
26:10
in the sense of joining the GSA and
26:14
talking to people, something that occurred in my early high school career as well was
26:21
just really gross levels of depression, which shut me down completely as a person.
26:32
So my direct interaction to the LGBTQ community was incredibly
26:39
minimal during that period of time,
26:43
except for some normal outlets I would call them, like theater, people exploring
26:49
themselves, and trying to figure out—theater allows a lot of people to
26:54
explore different ways of dressing and different ways of presenting themselves
26:57
with makeup by playing different characters to see how they connect to
27:03
the broader play, but also how they connect to certain characters to try
27:07
and figure their way through things.
27:10
I think that theater as a general tool has been incredibly helpful to a lot
27:15
of people in the LGBTQ+ community, just because it allows that level of personal
27:24
redefinition and play that doesn't exist in our larger society generally, but
27:32
what I will say is I didn't have any idea when I was in high school,
27:38
when I was in middle school, what was going on how things were going.
27:43
I know that I felt personally incredibly scared towards being gay, right, which
27:51
is how I identified at the time, as a gay male and just looking at that
27:55
and being like, I’m in a small town.
28:01
I don't know what that's going to do if I actually come out, because I have a friend
28:10
who came out openly early in our high school career who, Philomath is known for
28:18
having a very extensive forestry program,
28:23
and along with it there's a lot of connotations towards conservatism and
28:30
certain things that could be drawn there, but what I will say is my
28:34
friend who came out is openly gay.
28:37
The year that he came out he was physically assaulted
28:42
on multiple occasions.
28:44
He did not find good support from the teachers to be able to defend himself.
28:49
He was not able to do anything about it.
28:54
And the rampant bullying to this singular individual, the only person who was
28:58
openly gay in my entire high school at the time, and how inward and viciously
29:08
certain subsets of the community reacted to that, was very telling.
29:14
It instilled a lot of fear in myself.
29:18
Thinking back on that, that is, that's a really heavy thing, is knowing that
29:25
that person got cornered in hallways and got the shit kicked out of him.
29:32
And at a certain point,
29:35
quit school.
29:37
Just 100% quit
29:42
-- ended up themselves having to move to Portland, right, where
29:46
nobody knew who they were.
29:49
Had to distance themselves from all the people that they knew, all
29:53
the friends that they'd had, and all the people that they'd grown
29:55
up with just because they were gay.
30:02
It hurts, right?
30:04
If you're questioning yourself and you see somebody else who's like,
30:09
okay, I’m going to be open about this.
30:12
I’m going to talk about this as an actual thing and to see them get eviscerated
30:18
and nobody there to protect them.
30:24
It hurts.
30:27
The amount of stress that you then look at yourself and you're
30:29
like, maybe I am gay, right?
30:34
Maybe this is something that I have to think about, is if I openly present, am I
30:43
going to be subject to the same violence?
30:45
Am I going to see the larger scope of this, of how much support our
30:55
direct community has for these people?
30:57
When I see a direct, a direct history in this culture of this small town, I see
31:07
how somebody who is openly gay is treated.
31:12
So reflecting on your changing your identity every six months to a year
31:19
you said, would you say that in part that was finding yourself, but in part
31:24
was that to protect yourself as well?
31:27
Absolutely.
31:28
I will say that there's a lot of that.
31:36
Some of it was definitely the journey of finding who I was, how I wanted to
31:42
be, who I wanted to associate with, and then part of it was if during a
31:49
certain period of time I came off as too effeminate, if I lisped or if I talked
31:56
in certain ways, sort of exploring when that would get me into trouble and then
32:05
looking past that and deciding, okay that is going to cause some sort of issue.
32:12
I’m now reaching the point that I’m afraid for myself, right.
32:18
I’m going to pivot some of these things.
32:22
There are some wonderful and heinous pictures from the time period where
32:28
I have things this giant golden afro
32:34
and it is the most bizarre thing that I’ve ever seen, but trying to
32:39
identify with different cultures, both from my parents’ cultures and then
32:44
also to do with my interests, but, yes, to your question, absolutely.
32:52
There's part of it that is personal protection that people, the perception
32:58
of me and the broader scope was, “oh,
33:03
they're just trying to figure out who they are, what they're
33:06
doing. They're not actually that.”
33:10
Yeah, it was partially personal protection.
33:13
Yes.
33:13
It was a lot of self-finding.
33:17
Absolutely it was both.
33:20
So considering all of your experiences and you've mentioned several times
33:25
being in a very isolated community with not a lot of support, while towards
33:31
the end of high school what were your hopes and plans for the future?
33:38
That's rough.
33:42
I didn't personally think that I would survive past 21.
33:46
There were no personal conceptions of me that I had past a certain point.
33:52
There was just a dark curtain.
33:53
I had no idea.
33:56
Due to depression, due to all of these other factors that were going on.
34:04
Not that I was hopeless as a person, but just that I didn't have any sort of idea.
34:10
And I did not, in a very real way, think that I would survive past my early 20s.
34:18
I definitely applied to a bunch of colleges.
34:23
There was definitely the hope of maybe I can do something.
34:27
But there wasn't a real personal connection to what
34:31
that something could be.
34:34
In effect, what ended up happening is
34:39
I,
34:42
without the nomenclature of it, I was a runaway.
34:46
From the time that I was 15 onwards I lived predominantly on my friends’
34:51
couches, on the floor in different places.
34:55
I’ve been homeless for stints, and this is personally chosen homelessness, because
35:03
I don't want to, or I didn't want to deal with some of the social constraints.
35:08
I didn't want to deal with my parents.
35:10
I didn't want to deal with some of those relationships as depressive swings
35:13
happened how much I was able to push away from society and sequester myself.
35:20
I didn't have a lot of hopes towards who I would be or who I would become,
35:26
and I started going to college.
35:30
I went to LBCC [Linn-Benton Community College] , just sort of as general
35:34
explorative studies, trying to figure out
35:39
what is it that I’m interested in that I could do as a job in general.
35:45
I will say, and I mean no negative part of this, I think if I would have
35:51
full-heartedly gone into college at the time that I was getting out of
35:55
high school I may have been a theater major or worked in theater arts,
36:01
which I don't see as a negative thing, but looking back, especially as the
36:05
person that I am now, I know that that wouldn't have been a good fit.
36:11
But I spent quite a few years going to LB [LBCC] , taking small classes
36:15
here and there trying to figure out what it is that I wanted to do.
36:19
And it was rough because I didn't know that what I was
36:25
experiencing was depression.
36:27
But nothing spoke to me in a way that I was like, yeah!, that's what I want to do.
36:33
This is what I’m interested in.
36:37
Which, if you talk to me now, is an incredibly different situation.
36:41
But in my late teens, in my early 20s, I was, for all
36:45
intents and purposes, I was lost,
36:50
and I ended up getting a job at McDonald's.
36:55
That's, I think, 60% of America's first job is fast food.
36:59
So I did the most typical thing,
37:03
and in six months I was a shift supervisor and then a few months after that I was the
37:09
night shift manager and I was like, okay.
37:13
This is this is something that I can do.
37:16
Working has always been something that is very easy to me,
37:23
and I ended up, instead of pursuing school, dropping a lot of things
37:29
and sort of going into work.
37:32
I quit McDonald's.
37:34
After a certain point went back to school for a little bit.
37:35
I was like: maybe I’ll do this.
37:37
No.
37:37
That's not working.
37:38
Maybe I’ll do this?
37:39
No.
37:40
That's not working.
37:44
But I didn't know, and I still, I look at the time of life I’m like,
37:50
yeah there was no direction there.
37:54
I would gallivant.
37:56
I would adventure.
37:56
I would go to parties.
37:58
I would do all these things, but there wasn't any sort of conception or idea
38:03
of me working towards something, of me trying to either become something
38:08
or work towards a goal at all.
38:10
So yeah, in my early teens, I had no idea.
38:16
So then moving on a little bit into your early twenties, you mentioned
38:23
that you found that you were very good at the work that you were doing.
38:28
Can you share a little bit more about that?
38:30
Did you begin to find your footing with employment, something that you
38:33
recognized that you were very good at?
38:35
Yes.
38:37
I’ll put the TLDR [Too Long; Don’t Read] as yes, absolutely.
38:42
But to the much more of that, right?
38:47
I got into relationships with different people, which sort of stabilized
38:52
who I was to a very real extent.
38:56
I moved to different parts of the country.
38:58
I went to New York.
39:00
I went to Washington.
39:05
It was incredibly informative to learn how different parts of the country
39:09
were growing up in a small town.
39:12
But I absolutely took on employment as one of the main things
39:18
that I used to define myself.
39:21
I actually started here at Oregon State [University] as a custodian,
39:26
and similar to the story of McDonald's, and six months I was a lead.
39:33
I was later promoted into a supervisory capacity.
39:37
I became the administrative assistant for the facility services, well,
39:42
the custodial group of this campus.
39:45
From there I promoted into human resources and adult training, which really struck
39:52
sort of a chord with me as something that I could do in the way that I
39:55
talk to people and engage with people.
39:59
And then I was promoted into an assistant account manager
40:03
and of a management position.
40:04
And then eventually that got to the point where I was overseeing two managers
40:11
and 126 people and do the work through an entire stint of basically 10 years.
40:21
I [was] promoted into taking over all of the business in Denver,
40:28
Colorado, for the company and getting accolades as this is going on and
40:35
getting all these connections.
40:37
Then my boss personally deciding to move on, a new boss coming in, and I
40:44
don't get along with this new boss, and because of that, getting directly
40:49
fired and then there's this moment of lull and this is at year six or seven
40:55
being like, “what the shit?” I’ve been riding this momentum train for so long.
41:05
And I say a momentum train, but it was actively things that I was
41:10
doing, people I was talking to, things that I was making happen.
41:14
And a little bit of luck,
41:19
but getting to the point that I’m in Denver, Colorado, which is way,
41:25
way outside of where I grew up, and I don't have a decent support
41:32
network there, and my boss fires me, and I’m just like, well, shit.
41:37
What am I doing now?
41:40
And what year was this?
41:41
About how old were you?
41:43
This was late, mid to late 20s?
41:45
Yeah, this was mid to late 20s at that point.
41:49
The end of my 10th year of working with that company was March of last year.
41:55
So, yeah, that puts us at 2014 at that point.
42:02
But then I had a friend in Eugene, Oregon.
42:05
My father had moved down there.
42:10
I’ll say because he's a wonderful father,
42:14
and we can expand on that a little bit later, so he's moved down to Eugene.
42:23
He divorced my mom when I was 18, and, like I said, very early recognized
42:29
that there were cracks there at about 8 and about 12 being like, this isn't
42:33
a great situation and at the point that I’m 15 not even living with them.
42:37
It was very interesting when I was 18 to hear from them, “oh yeah,
42:41
by the way we were really staying together for you guys.” And we're
42:46
just like, “what, what the shit?”
42:52
At the point that I’m no longer directly engaged with this family
42:55
that can't be a real thing.
42:57
So they split up when I was 18.
42:59
My mother still lives in the area.
43:02
My father moved down to Eugene, like I said, because he's a good
43:04
father, and we'll get to that, but
43:09
all of my support network, all the people that I knew, even though in
43:13
that period of time of working I had cut connections with everybody and
43:17
the only thing that I was doing in a very large, real sense was working.
43:24
I will say there's relationships and some things like that we can go into, that sort
43:29
of color that period of time in my life.
43:30
But cut all those connections and then getting fired and having to reassess
43:36
who I was and what I was doing.
43:38
Moved in with a friend in Eugene and I’ve been living there ever since, basically.
43:42
Yeah,
43:46
and then the previous boss came back to the company, learned that
43:49
they had fired me and was like,
43:52
“what the hell!?” Hired me into the national projects team, and I started
43:56
traveling across the US [United States] dealing mostly with school districts
44:01
and universities and talking to them about facility services and being
44:04
like, hey your program here could be better if we did these things.
44:08
Let's organize this.
44:11
Let's look at the numbers here.
44:12
This isn't adding up.
44:13
Let's figure out what's happening here, and for like a year I would leave every
44:20
Monday, fly out to somewhere in the continental US, and when I say somewhere,
44:26
I’ll get back to that in a second, and then every Friday I would come home
44:31
and it was the most surreal experience, because it really taught me how much we
44:39
view and evaluate our world based on all of these little trappings that we have.
44:44
I no longer had a direct home, I would say, right.
44:52
And so on the weekends, I would show up and be there with my friends, and I had
44:58
a room that I was sharing in their house.
45:02
And that was my only real space.
45:04
But then Monday through Friday I put on my work boots, my button-up
45:09
shirt and said, okay f— all of that.
45:12
I’m doing this other thing, and it got really surreal around
45:19
month four or month five.
45:21
The company had the same hotel that they would always use.
45:25
This is our preferred hotel and so the furniture that you would see
45:30
in your room is exactly the same because, of course it is, chain hotels.
45:37
The layouts of the hotels are radically the same, that at a
45:40
certain point I would wake up.
45:43
I would, you blink, you look around you're like, “fuck, I have no idea where I am!”
45:52
I remember one day waking up, and in 30 minutes, I have to give this
45:57
training to upper management of a certain region, right? And I just
46:03
had no idea where I am in the world.
46:10
I’m talking to team members, we start that training.
46:13
And one of them inevitably asks, “hey, where are you guys?”
46:17
And I just pause and I’m like,
46:22
“I have no idea.” My friend and team member chips in and he's
46:28
like, “we're in Dallas, Texas.
46:31
We're in Dallas, right?” “Yeah, we're in Dallas.” Earlier
46:34
that week I think we were in
46:36
Florida.
46:37
The week before that we were in North Carolina.
46:42
It's incredible
46:46
how much some of those small trappings really affect your life, right.
46:50
And I just had no concept of where I was.
46:53
And I continued to do that for a good, another year, another year and a half.
46:59
And it's just, wow.
47:02
So clearly people, especially your boss that you had a great relationship with
47:07
saw an amazing amount of potential in you.
47:09
So you were on this career high.
47:12
During that time where things were relatively going well in
47:16
your career, professional life?
47:18
Maybe if we could go back a little bit to pre-Colorado, were your relationship
47:23
and your personal life also going well?
47:26
Were things in tandem there or not so much?
47:31
So yes, I will say that.
47:36
I’m going to very quickly touch on because this is sort of how I generally discuss
47:41
and frame my life in a very real way.
47:44
I had three big life stories.
47:47
The first one is don't buy a girl a car.
47:52
Because that happened, and there's an entire arc to that.
47:55
The second one which I think we're going to explain and get into
48:00
here is, don't buy a boy a house,
48:04
which then leads to my third story, which is actually a much nicer story,
48:09
which is movie stars need love, too.
48:13
But to those points, right.
48:17
I was dating a woman back in my 18, 19 and living with them and “don't buy a girl
48:26
a car” is that I’ve always been pretty good about being miserly with my money,
48:33
and the girl that I was dating had her car break down and I may have jointly
48:39
with them purchased a vehicle for them, which they didn't end up taking care of
48:45
and they weren't necessarily able to pay me back and learning the
48:50
lesson of just being like: okay, just because I can help financially
48:56
doesn't necessarily mean that I should.
49:01
There's a lot of fun and weird anecdotes that go with that, but one of the moms
49:06
who adopted me, and I have, I would say six different moms, who are like, “yeah
49:14
you can crash with us anytime you want to. If you need to go out for lunch or
49:19
do something, absolutely do so”, and they're all the mothers of my friends.
49:24
They're mothers of people that I was in relationships with.
49:29
Actually, two of them are my aunts.
49:32
So there's all of that.
49:36
Relationships with me have been a really large part of my life, right?
49:44
I would say that especially in my late teens, early twenties, in a very real
49:51
way, I was kind of a hopeless romantic.
49:54
There
49:57
was, before I moved out to New York, so this is 2006,
50:06
before I moved out to New York I had a friend who also grew up in the same town
50:11
and he was like, “I need to get out of this small town.” So moved over to New
50:16
York and was just having a ball of a time and they at a certain point extended an
50:20
invitation and they're like, “hey, why don't you come out here and experience
50:26
New York and come live with me?” And I was like, “cool, I’ll do that.” But before I
50:31
do, I’m going to help another one of my friends who was engaging in AmeriCorps
50:39
move up to Washington.
50:42
And that was the start of a very long and very tumultuous eight-year relationship,
50:52
but what ended up happening is I helped them move up to Washington, Whidbey
50:57
Island, Washington, in fact, so one of the San Juans and just helping them
51:03
get set up for AmeriCorps and their programs and everything like that.
51:08
We're looking at spending some time with them and just this
51:12
really wonderful one-on-one time.
51:15
We've been friends for a long time, but we hadn't really spent a lot of
51:18
time just alone and together, which
51:26
I will be very blunt and direct and say I was very attracted to them.
51:33
We'd spent this time together, and over that, two-week span,
51:39
I developed feelings for them.
51:41
And one of the things that I was trying to teach myself and still do, this is an
51:46
ongoing challenge of my life, is being open about how I’m feeling and what's
51:52
going on, so I told them I was just like, “hey, I really like you.” They're like
51:59
[makes dismissive noise] . No, no, no, no, no. I really like you and they're
52:01
like, “oh, well, I’m a straight male.
52:07
I’m not into that.” I’m just like, “that's totally cool but I have to tell you this.”
52:14
I have to put this out there just as a thing and also get it off of my chest
52:19
and shoulders and I was, like “cool.” So that's where we left things, right?
52:26
There was also a girl who at the time I thought was incredibly cute,
52:31
and I went on a few dates with while I was up there [welcome to being
52:35
20, well, early 20s, late teens], and I was like, no this is cool.
52:42
So the three of us would hang out for a while and then that two-week
52:48
stint of me being up there, because I had bought a bus ticket to go out
52:52
to New York to live with my friend,
52:56
I was like, “alright guys.
52:58
I’m leaving.” I got on the bus and it drove for three days.
53:05
If you can imagine being stuck on a cramped bus for three
53:07
days, yeah that was my life,
53:11
but so, that gentleman and that lady
53:16
started hanging out just the two of them and they developed
53:19
feelings for each other and were like, “hey we're doing this thing.
53:24
She kissed me.” I’m like, “you know what, that's totally cool.
53:28
I’m absolutely happy that you found something that you're interested in and
53:32
that they're interested in, and I think that'll be good.” So I went off to New
53:37
York with this conception that yeah, this is this is what I’m going to do.
53:43
I will say as just a side note, living in Brooklyn New York versus
53:47
living in a town of 5,000 people is a huge learning experience.
53:52
It was wonderful and amazing and for a short period of time there I sold comedy
53:59
tickets in Times Square, so if any of you have ever been to Times Square, I’m sorry.
54:05
I was one of those obnoxious people who tried to stop you on the sidewalk
54:10
and as a fun flavor to that there was a really, really attractive lady walking
54:17
down the street and at one point at the top of my lungs I was singing stop in
54:21
the name of love because I’m trying to sell for comedy tickets, and also because
54:27
I want to talk to her, and she stops.
54:31
I’m like, what?
54:32
That worked?
54:33
Okay, cool,
54:36
but then her mom stopped and her dad stopped and her little brother
54:41
stopped and I’m just like, “shit.
54:43
I’m in over my head!” But
54:49
during that period of time I was only in New York for a few months.
54:54
I was still in contact with the person in Washington.
54:59
I’m going to call them “Richard”, just because, and this is a little
55:03
bit of foreshadowing, just because I can then call them “Dick”,
55:08
which is great.
55:10
So, Dick
55:15
called me one day and was like, “hey
55:19
I really miss having you out here.
55:21
I really miss you spending time with me and being here with me.
55:28
I love you.” And I’m just like, “what the?”
55:34
But I’m kind of, that struck me, right?
55:39
And that very much was like, “oh, so is this a possibility?”
55:47
Then they followed up by saying, “if I bought you a train ticket
55:52
for next week, would you come back and live with me?” And I
56:00
was flabbergasted.
56:02
I hadn't had somebody do something that to me ever, and
56:06
I was just like: so you love me.
56:08
You want to spend time with me.
56:10
I like you.
56:10
You know this.
56:12
Yeah, absolutely.
56:15
So I’m living in New York with, in this itty-bitty freaking studio apartment with
56:20
four people, and it costs $1,200, and it's
56:27
probably a grand total of
56:31
200, maybe 150 square feet.
56:35
So, it's me and my closest three roommates, one of them being
56:40
one of my best friends, two of them being not my best friends.
56:47
And being like, yeah, okay.
56:50
I absolutely will come and live with you, especially if we're possibly having
56:58
this emotional entanglement, having this relationship actually become something.
57:03
I’m heads over heels interested in you, and you just told me you love me.
57:08
So yeah, I dropped everything in New York, and I was just like, “yeah!”
57:14
And they sent me a train ticket, and I crossed the U.S. again to be with them.
57:20
So you mentioned this was about an eight or so year relationship.
57:24
Do you want to share any overall lessons learned and what you took
57:30
from that relationship, perhaps both negative and positive?
57:34
Yeah.
57:37
I will say that this relationship was incredibly, incredibly
57:43
a big part of my life.
57:47
In moving back, we spent a good year in Washington, and I will say that
57:56
love was a very interesting thing, especially since they were still,
58:00
for all intents and purposes and how they identified, straight, and
58:08
I was a male.
58:10
I was male presenting, and I was assigned male at birth.
58:17
That was very interesting because it was incredibly emotionally supportive and
58:24
incredibly personally enriching, but it was non-sexual and so during that
58:32
relationship, Dick had the girl that we were friends with on the side, also in
58:41
a relationship, and I subsequently also had, as time went on, some very good
58:51
positive female relationships as well.
58:55
I had some incredibly good, open communicative explorations of what sort
59:03
of polyamory was in that sort of extent and the understanding that I cannot
59:10
provide for somebody everything that they need, and it would be arrogant
59:13
for me to think that I could, right?
59:16
And so it was very interesting to be in this relationship with Dick and to
59:22
also very openly be in relationships with women while I was doing that,
59:28
and before that point I very openly was yeah I’m a gay male, but then
59:35
there was a woman who challenged that, and they broadened my perception.
59:44
I was like, “okay maybe I’m more bi” and that's sort of built on itself.
59:50
I would identify personally now as
59:56
pansexual.
59:56
Gender is not necessarily something that I care a whole lot about, and I
1:00:02
know that there's a lot of different labels and terms that we use these
1:00:05
days: demisexuality, being interested sexually only after emotional
1:00:10
connection is made; sapiosexuality, where you're attracted to intelligence.
1:00:15
That, by the way, defines a lot of what I do.
1:00:17
Anyways, so what I learned from that relationship:
1:00:24
so very positively, Dick challenged me as a person.
1:00:28
We had the period of time in Washington.
1:00:32
They were in AmeriCorps and doing all of these things and interacting with
1:00:38
teaching at school groups and trying to make just where we were a better place
1:00:44
right, as is the main conception of what AmeriCorps is, is volunteer groups
1:00:48
that go out and help all these areas.
1:00:50
Moving back down to Corvallis as they started going to school and
1:00:55
then sort of challenging me to push what I could do, push who I was and
1:01:03
learn more and do all these things.
1:01:06
So Dick was incredible as a person and I can still think very
1:01:12
positive things about them, even if things turn very sour for us,
1:01:20
because I do think that they, in that time of their life, they were a fantastic
1:01:24
person in the sense of they were able to emotionally engage with people.
1:01:33
They were able to intellectually challenge people.
1:01:37
Around year six of that relationship,
1:01:43
Dick had always been dealing with some level of depression
1:01:46
themselves, and we were trying to be very open and conversational
1:01:49
about it and deal with parts of it,
1:01:52
but I remember
1:01:55
coming into our shared bedroom one day and there is, at that point,
1:02:03
two other women as part of this relationship on Dick's side and myself
1:02:09
in this house that we're sharing with all of us and a few roommates.
1:02:12
Dick
1:02:17
actively over the span of a few very long, very slow-moving hours, discussed
1:02:27
how they were going to kill themselves
1:02:33
and talked about how they were going to do it and what they were going
1:02:38
to do, and at a certain point in
1:02:43
that event, they took a knife to their own throat
1:02:48
and actively made a cut,
1:02:53
and what that does to you when you see somebody that you care about just
1:02:58
at that brink and feeling powerless to change that situation, that is
1:03:09
huge.
1:03:13
In that moment being powerless to change how they felt about things,
1:03:20
it was so far beyond anything that I could personally do.
1:03:25
They are knife to throat talking about why they're doing this and why
1:03:30
it's important to them and if they don't do this what will they become?
1:03:38
They don't know, and for them to actively
1:03:46
look at the possibility of just ending themselves right there in front of us,
1:03:50
even if we're trying to prevent it.
1:03:55
It's just one of those situations where you look at that and
1:03:58
you're like, this is so fucked.
1:04:03
I wish I had a more eloquent term to put towards that, but that
1:04:08
situation was really fucked up.
1:04:14
How that digressed was that one of our other roommates
1:04:18
came home and they were like,
1:04:25
“I don't want to subject them to this” and they put the knife down,
1:04:34
but that really, really put a pin in the coffin that was that relationship,
1:04:42
because this person who I was so emotionally engaged with, this person
1:04:47
that I was so intellectually engaged with, this non-sexual relationship
1:04:51
that I’ve had with them for many years,
1:04:54
I was powerless to help them.
1:04:58
Who I was couldn't help them, right, and it also was a large downturn
1:05:07
in their mental health in general.
1:05:11
They became more angry as a person.
1:05:13
They lashed out more,
1:05:16
even though I remember calling the cops on that at one point because
1:05:20
they were being suicidal, and we took them up to the hospital and
1:05:25
tried to get them help and that
1:05:29
being sort of a short-term band-aid to the larger thing that was going
1:05:33
on and trying to get them mental help in general, but they became
1:05:38
so much more of an angry person and they acted out and lashed out more.
1:05:44
We actually reached a point, and this is at, I think, about year seven, where they
1:05:50
became incredibly physically abusive.
1:05:55
At this point they're obviously being certain levels of emotionally abusive.
1:06:00
But they kicked the literal crap out of me for quite a few days.
1:06:10
I think back on this, and they never touched me above my shoulders.
1:06:16
They never touched me below where a t-shirt could be, right?
1:06:21
But my entire body was bruised.
1:06:24
My legs at certain points were black and blue, similar to the jeans
1:06:30
that I’m wearing right now, but in bruises and I could not walk.
1:06:38
For multiple days I would go to work, cover up the fact that I was
1:06:45
being terribly beaten at home, and put on that PR face and be like,
1:06:54
“how's your day going?” and talking to people as if it wasn't happening
1:07:00
while in my mind I’m trying to figure out, “okay, this didn't work.
1:07:06
What set them off?
1:07:07
How can I diffuse the situation?
1:07:10
How can I work through this?” And so over the span of quite a few days
1:07:17
after that started becoming physically abusive, I would work, I would go home.
1:07:23
The people that I was around saw that I like, sort of retracted a little
1:07:26
bit, but didn't see any large changes.
1:07:29
And so I was still working full-time, and I would go home.
1:07:33
And every day, we would get into a fight.
1:07:36
We would talk about something, and it would get violent.
1:07:41
And I would get, I could describe all sorts of things, having somebody
1:07:48
kick their knee into my back while I’m lying face down on the ground,
1:07:53
being held down and choked and just beaten and kicked, and just
1:08:02
reaching the point that they stop.
1:08:06
And I’m so thankful that they stop.
1:08:11
Going to bed, waking up, going to work, and then coming home.
1:08:16
That happens again.
1:08:19
And that went on for a little while until I just reached a
1:08:24
breaking point, personally.
1:08:27
And I am so thankful to my father.
1:08:31
I am so thankful to my father.
1:08:37
After one of the days,
1:08:42
Dick had to go do something the next morning.
1:08:44
I didn't have to go to
1:08:47
work.
1:08:48
I am bruised, battered, obviously emotionally, then put through the wringer,
1:08:57
and I’m able to call my father.
1:09:01
I haven't really talked to anybody outside of the house while this is going on.
1:09:06
The only thing that was happening was work, because I
1:09:08
needed to support the house or
1:09:12
at home where I got the shit kicked out of me until either I
1:09:14
was unconscious or they stopped.
1:09:20
But I called my father, and the only thing that I said to him, the only thing that
1:09:25
I said to him was, “I need you to pick me
1:09:33
up.” He was in the middle of work. He was doing whatever he was doing.
1:09:39
And I’m incredibly thankful for the fact that he didn't ask any questions.
1:09:44
He didn't say anything.
1:09:45
The only thing that happened at that very moment was, “I’ll be there in 15.”
1:09:57
And so he did.
1:10:00
He dropped literally everything that he was doing.
1:10:03
He drove from where he was working, out to where I was.
1:10:09
Gave me a hug.
1:10:10
Didn't ask me any questions.
1:10:13
Loaded me up with a basket full of stuff and took me
1:10:24
in.
1:10:24
I say, and I preface this with the fact that this was an eight-year
1:10:31
relationship, and this is at year seven -- I went back, right.
1:10:39
I lived with my father and recuperated and tried to figure out what went wrong,
1:10:43
tried to figure out what had happened, how we'd reached this point, what I
1:10:47
could do, because I put in seven years of my life into this relationship and
1:10:53
it was core to how I saw the world.
1:10:57
It was core to how I motivated myself.
1:10:58
It was core to what I was doing in my life.
1:11:05
And so, I was able to, in a few months of living with my dad and starting
1:11:12
to talk to Dick again, just convinced myself that there was still a chance.
1:11:21
And I went back.
1:11:22
And how we interacted changed considerably.
1:11:28
Because they then knew that I could escape and that some other people were aware
1:11:32
that some of this stuff had happened.
1:11:35
They were,
1:11:38
I will say that it was very nice for a time.
1:11:41
I went back to it and I still had all of the dreams and hopes that we’d had
1:11:48
had previously, all the things that we wanted to do together in our lives as
1:11:52
this background to okay I can't throw this away and we ended up investing
1:11:59
in and buying a house together.
1:12:01
After all of this has happened,
1:12:06
I bought a house with Dick, and there's some other things going on here.
1:12:12
Ostensibly we purchased the house because that friend who I’d met up in Washington
1:12:17
who they were in a relationship with developed Dissociative Identity Disorder,
1:12:25
previously known as Multiple Personality, and the
1:12:30
main thing in getting them some therapy and some help, the main thing that
1:12:34
we could do to assist them was to create a stable environment and so
1:12:42
we were afraid of being kicked out of where we were renting and things
1:12:46
like that, especially as where we were living became more expensive.
1:12:50
We didn't know what that would do to us that we decided collectively
1:12:56
that we would purchase a house
1:13:00
for their care and reality,
1:13:06
and
1:13:10
if you knew my father, my father is a very—my father's kind of an ass, but
1:13:18
he very much has this research mindset of “oh, yeah, we can find how to save
1:13:23
money here and do these things.” He's very miserly, but we created an LLC with
1:13:32
Dick as the CEO and myself as the CFO.
1:13:36
We created an LLC with the entire intent and purpose to purchase a house.
1:13:41
That's all the LLC was built for,
1:13:45
but as a corporation there were a huge number of things that we could do
1:13:51
towards tax returns and all these things.
1:13:53
So we purchased this house together and I invested, besides supporting
1:14:00
this group of people for so many years and all these things, I
1:14:05
invested $25 grand into this house
1:14:12
and, as I’ve already said, this relationship ended and that's because
1:14:17
a year after us buying this house and trying to set this thing up together,
1:14:26
in this last year, Dick, in an effort to try and keep me,
1:14:35
opened the relationship up to being a sexual relationship as well.
1:14:40
I know now much more than I did at that moment in time, because that's
1:14:44
something that I’d always wanted.
1:14:47
that this was a manipulation, that this was sexual abuse.
1:14:53
So that entered into that as well and at the end of that next year things
1:14:59
took another turn, where Dick beat the shit out of me again in a very
1:15:08
real way that moment, I realized that nothing had changed, right.
1:15:16
In this last beating we were arguing over interviews and money
1:15:25
and things like that and then he started kicking the shit out of me.
1:15:30
I didn't know this was possible, but he lifted me by my scrotum and threw
1:15:37
me bodily down onto the kitchen floor.
1:15:42
I didn't know that was possible, but
1:15:46
that tells you
1:15:50
how directly violent this was
1:15:56
and at the end of that beating the person who had Dissociative
1:16:01
Identity Disorder, one of the personalities came over and was like,
1:16:08
“I need you to leave. I need you to take yourself out of here for
1:16:14
your own good. And especially if the main thing that you're looking
1:16:19
at is creating a safe environment for us, this can't keep happening.”
1:16:26
So I left that.
1:16:31
I sold my share in that LLC for, I think, two cents
1:16:42
with no intent to get any of that back.
1:16:46
You just needed to leave.
1:16:47
Yeah.
1:16:48
Was this around the time then that you moved to Colorado?
1:16:52
Did that coincide to get physically, geographically away?
1:16:55
Yeah.
1:16:57
I told my boss, they didn't know why, but I told my boss that I was
1:17:02
interested in moving up in the company and that I needed to, I was finally
1:17:07
ready to get away from where I was.
1:17:10
And they had just sold some accounts out in Denver, Colorado, and they're
1:17:13
like, “hey, I think you'd be a perfect fit here.” And they just,
1:17:18
they promoted me into that position.
1:17:19
And that's when I say that I took over all of the business
1:17:24
in Denver, that was part of why.
1:17:28
I got out of that situation and as I was able to sit down and just think about
1:17:33
some of these things, I finally started to get some groundwork figured out
1:17:39
towards myself and it became a healing and learning about me period of time,
1:17:46
and for the first time I actually saw a psychologist and they were fantastic and
1:17:53
dealing with some of that trauma and some of those issues, which allows me to bring
1:17:56
them up and actually talk about them now.
1:17:58
Whereas a year ago I couldn't.
1:18:01
Two years ago there were parts of it that I did not emotionally
1:18:05
or mentally have any access to.
1:18:09
That's sort of the way with trauma.
1:18:11
You sort of push it down until you can deal with parts of it.
1:18:15
But anyways, the psychologist, we had discussions about all of these things:
1:18:23
about how I felt about the world how I interacted with it and they were very
1:18:26
much you might consider this may be Gender Dysphoria and we discussed it
1:18:35
and talked about some of the things that are related to that and so they
1:18:38
were like, yeah you're pretty much a textbook case of having Gender Dysphoria.
1:18:47
I started exploring the possibility of being trans.
1:18:51
I will say, obviously now I female
1:18:57
present, but I started transitioning and I will say I do not in any way
1:19:05
suggest it for anyone, just in all sorts of reasons but I have personally
1:19:13
gone through puberty four times now.
1:19:17
I transitioned for a year, found out and realized that I
1:19:22
was completely sterile, right,
1:19:26
but at that moment, I, up to that point I thought that I would be a
1:19:31
terrible parent and I wanted nothing to do with having kids or any of these
1:19:35
things and they warn you and they tell you what some of these things are,
1:19:38
and so I’m transitioning for a year
1:19:42
and I’m sterile and I get that prognosis and I just fell to my knees and cried.
1:19:47
It
1:19:50
wasn't necessarily an understanding that I wanted to be a mother or anything
1:19:56
like that, but there's some very core things to that that are really jarring
1:20:01
and really shaking so much so that I learned how much I wanted to nurture
1:20:09
people and what I had been doing in my relationships is sort of taking a
1:20:13
motherly figure role in a lot of people's lives that I wanted that possibility.
1:20:18
So I de-transitioned,
1:20:23
started producing sperm again, froze sperm, and then started re-transitioning.
1:20:29
That is the weirdest thing, by the way, that you can put your body through,
1:20:34
is in your early 30s deciding that you want to go through female puberty,
1:20:41
go through male puberty again, and then go through female puberty again.
1:20:47
But it much more fit who I was and what I was doing and
1:20:51
what I wanted from the world.
1:20:53
And you were doing it with the support of a mental health professional who was
1:20:57
helping you guide through the process?
1:21:00
Yes.
1:21:00
That is including the point of, like I said, at a certain point I
1:21:06
was doing national projects, and I would fly out every Monday, and
1:21:09
I would fly back in every Friday.
1:21:11
Well, Monday through Friday, I would present male: button-up shirt, slacks,
1:21:18
work shoes, and I would lead trainings of 250 people of vice-president-level
1:21:25
and below in our company,
1:21:29
and I would present male.
1:21:31
Then on Friday I would fly home and with the people I was close to and where
1:21:37
I was living I would present female, and so I did not—I started living
1:21:44
two lives in a very real way: how I presented, how I talked, how I dealt
1:21:50
with things, was very different and we reached a point where I was hiding my
1:21:57
transition from work wearing binders, pretending to be just male, even though
1:22:02
my face shape was changing, things like
1:22:06
that.
1:22:07
There became too much cognitive dissonance between who I was in
1:22:10
the weekends and who I was during
1:22:14
the week.
1:22:14
That, having made the connection that I did, I talked to the
1:22:17
head of human resources.
1:22:18
And this was a very fun and weird experience.
1:22:22
The head of human resources is this much older lady and we're
1:22:26
in the middle of Tennessee.
1:22:28
She has grown and lived there her entire life and we're sitting down and I’m like,
1:22:35
“I want to change my gender marker in the company to female. How do I do that?”
1:22:39
And she was just, “you want to do what?
1:22:44
You want to, huh?” I was like, “well, I would to present as female and I would
1:22:49
to have the company recognize that I’m female.” And there was just this moment
1:22:55
where she's taken back, she's like, “hon, what did you say?” This is 2015, 2016,
1:23:08
and she's just like, has no idea.
1:23:13
The company has no idea.
1:23:14
There are no openly trans people and there's only a very, very small amount
1:23:19
of openly gay people within the company and so she's just like, “I don't think
1:23:26
that will be an issue.” I think because I was friends with her and able to talk
1:23:33
to her about it, she was like, “okay,
1:23:38
we can try that, we can see what that
1:23:42
does.” And then I also talked to my direct bosses.
1:23:47
There's a lot of weird anecdotes that go with this one, but I talked to some of my
1:23:50
direct bosses about how they felt about transgenderism and gays or pardon, people
1:23:58
who exist within the LGBTQ+ community.
1:24:02
And they were conversationally positive.
1:24:06
So, at a certain point when we were going to go do a training out in Chicago,
1:24:14
I didn't change.
1:24:15
How I presented on Sunday is how I presented on Monday.
1:24:21
So, they're getting off of their airplane ready to go to work and business as usual,
1:24:28
and they're looking for me in the airport, and I am dressed very differently.
1:24:35
I’m presenting very differently.
1:24:36
They don't really recognize me, and I tug on their shirt
1:24:38
and they're just like, “shit.”
1:24:42
It hadn't occurred to them after our discussion that I would actively do that.
1:24:48
I will say as a quick aside towards that is they, later in the car we're just like,
1:24:57
“I don't think this will be a problem.
1:24:59
You're a very attractive woman” and then they paused and sat back a second and
1:25:04
were like, “I shouldn't have said that.”
1:25:09
But I was able to from there forward openly present female in all of my
1:25:16
workspaces, and especially at the level that I was at in the company, that
1:25:20
very visibly affected the ability of other people to more actively present,
1:25:27
because I get away with Bryant.
1:25:30
Somehow people typically have a moment of cognitive, a bump where
1:25:36
they're “nah your parents named you oddly, you're not assigned male at
1:25:43
birth.” And there's some of that which is very interesting and weird,
1:25:50
but it's also had some incredibly negative effects on, to me professionally, right.
1:26:01
I was used to running these large trainings and to set up these systems
1:26:05
and doing all the mathematical backdrop to all of these systems, and I recall,
1:26:10
so very vividly, working in, shoot, that may have been Kentucky, but
1:26:22
we were doing a small training with 10 people and it's me and one of
1:26:26
my male co-workers who's also on the team and a good friend of mine,
1:26:32
and every time I talked, they would nod and smile like you do and then
1:26:39
they would turn to my male presenting co-worker and be like, “so how does
1:26:43
this work?” How does this system go?
1:26:46
He's just like a deer in the headlights.
1:26:47
He's like, “I don't know. Ask her.” And so they would engage with me for
1:26:52
a second and I would talk about some of the systems or some of the math
1:26:55
behind how we figured these things out.
1:26:56
And they'd be like, “oh, okay.” And then they would turn right
1:26:59
back to him and be like, “so how are we going to implement this?
1:27:02
What do we do from here?” And it was very surreal
1:27:08
to reach a point where I passed enough that I was not seen as a good authority on
1:27:15
scientific and mathematical based things.
1:27:18
That's not great.
1:27:19
But in a certain way, it was kind of personally just like,
1:27:24
oh, this is really a thing.
1:27:28
And then also walking down the street, either getting catcalled, getting any
1:27:34
sort of female typical sexual abuse.
1:27:38
I’m just like, fuck.
1:27:44
In some ways it's personally, I’m like, well cool, I pass.
1:27:49
And that's an entire conversation in itself, the concept of passing
1:27:53
and living stealth that I think is a much more broad conversation
1:27:57
than we may be able to have here,
1:28:01
but just some of those situations where I’m realizing that I
1:28:04
sort of have hit that point.
1:28:08
And in the same way that I’m very openly talking about trauma that I personally
1:28:14
experienced, I’ve started much more working towards being able to give
1:28:19
back to the communities and providing assistance to people who are younger
1:28:24
than myself because I am very readily aware that I could have gone through a
1:28:30
lot less personal trauma if there was more support of these sorts of things.
1:28:37
Well so let's pause right here for a moment and we can come back to that
1:28:41
in just a little bit, but let's go ahead and just pause for a moment.
1:28:50
[change in room locations]
1:28:52
So we paused for a moment, but now we are back, and we're regrouped to continue
1:28:58
on with the oral history interview.
1:29:01
So let's backtrack a little bit and pick up where we left off.
1:29:06
So you were talking about your experience with the transition process and how
1:29:13
people were perceiving you differently and the reactions that you received.
1:29:18
It seems your employee colleagues were relatively supportive, your
1:29:25
company as a whole was supportive.
1:29:27
Is there anything else regarding your employment that you would
1:29:31
like to share in terms of the connection to your experience?
1:29:35
Well, yes, so there's quite a few different points onto that.
1:29:42
I shared for the most part, a lot of the positive experiences, right?
1:29:49
But at the same time, I do wish to voice a little bit more that
1:29:54
my work wasn't necessarily always super positive towards that.
1:30:00
When it was a smaller company before, the original company that I was working
1:30:04
for was kind of a good old boys club,
1:30:09
which made me really reticent to come out as even gay at a certain point, that
1:30:16
I was masking the fact that I was gay
1:30:20
for the possibility of advancing and so that was kind of a weird thing to be
1:30:27
considering, right, is the denial of who you are and how you express yourself and
1:30:33
all these things and about your life so that you have increased opportunity, I
1:30:40
suppose, is the way to say it, or the perceived stability of being perceived
1:30:46
as a straight male versus being perceived as either a gay male or a trans female.
1:30:52
So
1:30:55
there's some different layers to that.
1:30:57
My direct bosses, my direct people that I worked with: fantastic.
1:31:05
But that's what allowed me to come out to a certain extent is I had good connections
1:31:11
with human resources and I would call them every week, every two weeks to a
1:31:18
month, just to make sure I wasn't causing any issues, because I was very aware of
1:31:32
the fact of if I caused a lot of issues, how that may negatively
1:31:39
affect someone else being able to come out in this workforce and
1:31:46
with working with these people.
1:31:47
It was the first time they had interacted with somebody who was trans, whether
1:31:50
they necessarily knew it or not.
1:31:53
And there were a lot of cases where they didn't have any idea, it wasn't
1:31:57
a problem, and it wasn't a thing.
1:31:59
Living in that sort of stealth mentality where it's like, I may not
1:32:03
always openly say, “hey, I’m trans.”
1:32:09
Because not that it's not important, but in certain circumstances maybe it's
1:32:15
not an appropriate conversational time.
1:32:21
The reason that I bring that up is I was on the national projects team and
1:32:28
I can't remember what state I was in, but I was going to go do a walk of a
1:32:36
school, assess what was going on, what was happening, and I suddenly had my
1:32:47
agenda shifted and didn't know why, right?
1:32:54
But it's because somebody that I was working with, after I’d done their
1:33:00
initial overarching training and things that and went and met with
1:33:06
them closer to where they worked and what they were doing, they didn't
1:33:14
want somebody who presented as I do,
1:33:21
they didn't want to be associated with that in their workplace.
1:33:26
And so they canceled a bunch of building walks that I was going to do with them.
1:33:33
Because typically I meet principals and facilities people and talk to
1:33:40
people, get their feelings on what's going on and try and figure out
1:33:42
what culturally is happening there to see how I can fix things, right?
1:33:48
They very consciously were like, “no, this is not happening.” I cannot, and
1:33:55
the words that it was described to me,
1:34:01
because I always asked, “hey, what happened?
1:34:03
How are things going?
1:34:04
Am I causing any issues?
1:34:06
How can I ameliorate or mitigate problems that are coming up?” They had a direct
1:34:15
concern that was brought up they're like, “we can't have a man who's wearing that
1:34:19
much makeup walk through our schools.
1:34:23
We can't have a man do that.” And I was just like [makes facial expression of
1:34:29
exhausted annoyance] . At that point I was openly presenting female, right, and
1:34:36
I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't necessarily
1:34:40
know and they may not have any sort of personal connection to this sort
1:34:45
of thing that would allow them to more openly accept or talk about or deal
1:34:49
with any of that in any sort of way.
1:34:51
But to mitigate and to defer that problem, what they did was they straight up
1:35:00
cancelled any interaction that I had with that group in a professional capacity.
1:35:06
They were just like, nope, and
1:35:12
it was very interesting to me.
1:35:16
I didn't learn about that in the direct -- for all intents and purposes
1:35:21
we had a professional interaction, we talked very professionally, we dealt with
1:35:26
things in a professional manner right.
1:35:29
We came up with plans of how to help out that school district and all these things.
1:35:34
I thought it was weird that instead of us, as we typically do, doing a
1:35:38
building walk during the day seeing how things are operating things, seeing
1:35:42
how things are going, we did a building walk in the middle of the night.
1:35:47
I was just this is weird, but I didn't necessarily know why until after.
1:35:54
But to say that it's all been sunshine and rainbows and positive would be a fallacy.
1:36:02
How did your then team respond to that?
1:36:05
Did they support you afterwards?
1:36:07
Was there any sort of accountability or reparations
1:36:11
to that individual who did that
1:36:13
to you?
1:36:14
No.
1:36:16
That one was, for all intents and purposes, that one was
1:36:19
kind of swept under the rug.
1:36:20
I didn't actually let my team members know that it occurred,
1:36:27
partially because I personally didn't know that it had occurred, but
1:36:30
secondarily because they had been, and they were incredibly supportive
1:36:35
of me, and just glazed over things and the entire discussion on pronouns
1:36:42
and missing pronouns and stuff like that, they were incredibly good.
1:36:48
The president of the company,
1:36:52
in all of my direct interactions with the president of the company or
1:36:57
when the president was talking about me as a person, they didn't drop a
1:37:02
pronoun once, and I was just like, it was sort of awe-inspiring to me.
1:37:10
I always joke that
1:37:15
I’ll give people all of this time and space to figure out
1:37:20
pronouns and I’m not really right
1:37:24
on top of it, right?
1:37:25
I’m like, “guys that's it's fine.
1:37:27
It's a learning thing.
1:37:28
I understand that this is how I identify with female pronouns and I would for
1:37:34
you to use them as sort of a joint sign of respect, but I don't require that
1:37:41
you get it perfect all the time.” And the joke that I always use is, at the
1:37:45
point that my brother can do all the pronoun stuff and be perfectly good
1:37:49
with it, then you guys will be on watch,
1:37:54
but my brother has actually been one of the most positive proponents
1:37:58
of this entire thing in general and helped change the minds of some of
1:38:02
the other people that we work with.
1:38:04
Anyways, to the point that we were talking about,
1:38:11
no reparations really happened, and it was a direct situation where we,
1:38:18
because I didn't find out about it till afterwards, I didn't
1:38:21
necessarily raise an issue, either.
1:38:25
I do very much feel that
1:38:28
this is a change of education that's coming, whether there is a singular person
1:38:34
who doesn't necessarily agree with it or see it, I think, is for the most part
1:38:40
is sort of whatever, because the larger societal movement, how it is presented,
1:38:46
accepted, and talked about has changed drastically in just the few years that
1:38:52
I have been openly trans, not only that but accessibility of different services,
1:38:59
trans services, health, how that's moved forward, health professionals,
1:39:05
insurances, all that has changed in a way that I couldn't initially have thought.
1:39:14
The speed at which it's shifting is just so much faster because there are so
1:39:18
many allies in so many different ways.
1:39:21
And no, no reparations happened.
1:39:25
But I don't think that's,
1:39:28
I don't blame the company for that at all.
1:39:33
So then you spoke about this a little bit, but to explore more,
1:39:38
you mentioned your brother and how supportive your brother is.
1:39:41
Could you share a little bit more about your personal life in terms of the support
1:39:46
or not of this experience, your family and
1:39:50
friends?
1:39:51
So I moved back to Eugene because there was a support network here, because I
1:39:58
had connections to people who knew that I was trans, people who were supportive:
1:40:07
my father, both my father and my stepmom.
1:40:16
It's interesting.
1:40:18
I came back to Eugene from Colorado because there was
1:40:24
so much more support here.
1:40:25
I could have moved anywhere in the country, financially speaking,
1:40:29
I’ve been relatively stable.
1:40:33
When I say that I’ve been miserly with funds, it allowed me to
1:40:37
contemplate moving anywhere that I’d been or staying in Denver.
1:40:43
And the support network part of things was so incredibly important
1:40:46
to me, especially as I was starting to feel out and starting to try and
1:40:51
figure out what it meant to be trans.
1:40:55
How to present female.
1:40:57
I can't even tell you the amount of times that things like going into a
1:41:04
dressing room causes this giant wash of dysphoria because I am not built
1:41:11
in standard female proportions, is the easiest way that I can say that.
1:41:18
Also because I weight lift.
1:41:20
That's partially my fault and I accept that, but
1:41:30
my brother also experienced a certain level of depression and I recognized that
1:41:35
in him after I was relatively well set up in the company that I was working for.
1:41:40
He had lost his job at a certain point and something very, I guess,
1:41:47
beautiful happened towards the rekindling of our relationship.
1:41:52
My brother and I have, we've existed as parallels, not
1:41:58
necessarily crossing over that much.
1:42:01
Our interests didn't usually align and we didn't have a direct brotherly love,
1:42:09
but my brother values family at a huge level that I don't think
1:42:16
most people even in my family do,
1:42:20
and I’ve sort of learned and gotten to see them grow into this wonderful
1:42:27
adult, and partially when they were going through a really bad depressive
1:42:32
cycle: they lost their job, they were living out with my mother way out in
1:42:38
the boonies where we grew up isolated so
1:42:44
that he could make rent.
1:42:46
I made it so that he had to have dinner with me once every week and I would assign
1:42:55
him an essay or a topic or something like that so that he would have an active
1:42:59
engagement outside of just the house and so we started talking and started
1:43:05
dealing with certain things and sort of rekindling our relationship, and then
1:43:08
I had him move in with me for a year.
1:43:11
I helped set him up interacting with people, put them around
1:43:17
people, and then also got him a job
1:43:21
for the same company that I was working for, but yeah, but
1:43:25
helped him: this is what you do.
1:43:29
This is how you do that,
1:43:32
and I got to see over that year’s time him sort of blossom in a
1:43:39
way that I didn't expect, but
1:43:43
in dealing with some of his depressive issues and having somebody to
1:43:46
talk about or talk to about them
1:43:50
just looking at it in that sort of way, he became exposed
1:43:55
to what was going on with me.
1:43:59
I became exposed to what was going on with him.
1:44:02
So we were able to basically, like I keep saying, rekindle this relationship
1:44:08
where we could actually talk some, and we're still, our relationship
1:44:13
is still mostly parallel lives that don't really intersect that much, but
1:44:19
something very beautiful happened when I came out as trans to the company.
1:44:25
He still worked for the place where I started with the
1:44:28
people that I started with, and
1:44:35
they were talking to him over a holiday and they asked him, “hey,
1:44:42
how's your brother doing?” And he just quizzically looked at them and
1:44:46
he's like, “you mean my sister?”
1:44:51
And it was that moment, right, really sort of solidified in my mind, what our
1:44:59
relationship was and how supportive, even if we don't talk a lot, it let me know
1:45:10
where he stood and how he felt about it.
1:45:13
And I think that that was fantastic.
1:45:17
My father is incredibly supportive.
1:45:23
And I go over there to see him and
1:45:29
my stepmom relatively often and just talk, shoot the shit, talk
1:45:34
about things that are going on.
1:45:37
I think as a way to sort of describe our relationship, I have
1:45:42
a wonderful, wonderful little story about this, where my dad has
1:45:46
always been relatively accepting.
1:45:48
He will do a lot of research about anything that I’m interested in
1:45:52
so that he can talk about and get a better feel of something.
1:45:56
He does insane amounts of research just for himself and
1:45:59
for his personal enrichment.
1:46:00
After
1:46:03
I had come out as trans, one of the questions that comes up, and
1:46:07
I will always, always tell people, surgeries, especially for a trans
1:46:15
female, I do get asked by people: “hey, do you still have a dick?”
1:46:25
Not only is that sort of an invasive question, right, what does it matter?
1:46:31
Have you had surgeries?
1:46:32
Have you done these things?
1:46:34
Anyways, so my father had been doing some research and sort of had a general
1:46:39
base understanding of some of these things but I went to have dinner with
1:46:43
them one day and we were talking, because I was telling them directly
1:46:49
that if I decide to do bottom surgery, I may be incapacitated and not able
1:46:55
to take care of myself for a while.
1:46:57
It is major surgery.
1:47:01
Before I could say anything, before my dad could say anything, my stepmom chimed in.
1:47:06
She was just like, “you have a place to stay here. We'll take care of you.”
1:47:12
That was just one of those moments where I was like, oh shit.
1:47:17
This is sort of the maternal interaction that I had always
1:47:22
been looking for and that is sort indicative of my relationship to them.
1:47:27
To describe my relationship with my father of course, in having done
1:47:32
research, he turned to me and he's like, “you know, instead of getting
1:47:38
a vagina you could get a new car”
1:47:42
-- because it's like $20-$25 grand plus, $35 grand, depending on what you do.
1:47:48
All these things.
1:47:49
The expense of it is huge.
1:47:50
And he just says to me, “you know, instead of a vagina, you get a new car.”
1:47:55
Without a pause, I just turned to him.
1:47:57
I was like, “I know which one I’ll get better miles out of.” He fell
1:48:01
out of his chair [laughing] . It is a wonderful moment where I caught
1:48:08
my father in just like a pause.
1:48:12
And my stepmom is laughing and rolling in her chair.
1:48:18
He is just has a pause and then it clicks and then he starts laughing
1:48:22
and it's just, I think that sums up my relationship with them kind of well,
1:48:30
just in understanding of where we stand.
1:48:34
So they are incredibly supportive.
1:48:38
My mother, however, is not, and that's the reason that I bring up
1:48:46
some precepts very early in this interview about traditional Chinese is
1:48:50
I can't, I don't know her very well.
1:48:55
As an adult I don't know her very well.
1:49:01
I have seen and what I’ve observed between depressive issues and mental health
1:49:06
problems and all of these things, they exist there and even though I cannot
1:49:12
professionally diagnose or say anything like that, the way that we interact is
1:49:16
kind of strained and it was—the sexual abuse when I was in middle school,
1:49:25
it caused some sort of schism, some sort of strain.
1:49:28
When I actively presented as gay, that gap seemed to have widened.
1:49:36
In my early 20s, I dated a gentleman who was significantly older than I was,
1:49:45
and we got engaged, and when I told her, that the gap widened even further.
1:49:53
So in a very kind of real way I sort of see coming out as trans to her as
1:50:04
the last thing that broke the camel's back sort of situation.
1:50:07
All these things piling up, piling up, piling up,
1:50:12
that our relationship—to say that we have a relationship would be a fallacy.
1:50:18
I
1:50:21
will say that I very much would value knowing who this woman
1:50:28
who bore me into this world is
1:50:32
in any sort of way just understanding: How did this affect you?
1:50:39
What is this?
1:50:40
Who are you now?
1:50:41
What do you value?
1:50:42
I don't really know any of those things and we can sit down and we
1:50:46
can have dinner once or twice a year
1:50:52
and I still value, I still very much personally want a relationship there,
1:51:00
even though I have a lot of very positive maternal figures in my life,
1:51:03
but just an understanding from her point of view: What was this to you?
1:51:10
Why are we this way?
1:51:13
How do we move past here?
1:51:15
Can we move past here?
1:51:16
Is there a possibility of any sort of relationship here?
1:51:19
At least at the moment, I’m hopeful, but I will say that in reality, at the moment,
1:51:29
no.
1:51:29
She canceled Mother's Day.
1:51:32
I was setting up something with my brother to go and have dinner with
1:51:34
her for Mother's Day, and she canceled that, and I didn't hear from her.
1:51:40
I was a little bit cross.
1:51:41
I wasn't given any sort of explanation anything that, and I will say
1:51:44
that I’m sometimes a little petty
1:51:49
and I’ve been trying to put in effort, and trying to put in effort, trying to
1:51:53
put in effort, and how this came across is we're coming to Mother's Day, something
1:51:59
like that, and I want to celebrate who my mom is and have an opportunity
1:52:02
to talk to her and learn a little bit more about her, and it gets canceled.
1:52:05
I’m just like, fine.
1:52:10
I didn't hear from her.
1:52:12
We didn't talk.
1:52:13
We didn't exchange messages until she wished me a Merry Christmas.
1:52:20
So that's eight or nine months, and to say that we are strangers
1:52:27
in the night would say that we're in the same vicinity and we're not.
1:52:34
So yeah, support of my mother doesn't exist.
1:52:38
Support from my father is fantastic.
1:52:39
My friends are incredible.
1:52:46
The girl who I moved in with helped me through all sorts of trials and
1:52:51
tribulations to do with dressing and presenting and talking about
1:52:56
things, and there's a lot of fun anecdotes to do with that.
1:53:02
I will say
1:53:05
women's clothing sucks,
1:53:09
and you may hear this from all sorts of other people who present as trans
1:53:13
female: Women's clothing is kind of awful in certain ways my wardrobe now
1:53:18
has smalls to triple XLs and they're the same size, the different styles.
1:53:26
As much as I love the ability to do different colors and to dress myself
1:53:31
in very different ways than I was able to presenting masculine, right.
1:53:38
I also see things, like I may not like personally carrying a purse and
1:53:43
none of these things have pockets.
1:53:45
I know that's a very common point of contention.
1:53:50
It's just
1:53:53
there aren't any pockets.
1:53:54
It may look good, right?
1:53:57
A lot of the clothing may look good.
1:53:58
It doesn't necessarily last to the levels that I’m used to clothing lasting.
1:54:03
It costs me more.
1:54:04
I’m just like, man.
1:54:08
So it sounds there were both frustrating but also fun aspects of figuring out
1:54:15
clothes and earrings and accessories?
1:54:18
Oh, yeah.
1:54:19
Friendships that help support you through that.
1:54:22
Absolutely.
1:54:22
I
1:54:26
have a multitude of, a lot of, very good and supportive
1:54:31
people in my life right now.
1:54:35
And
1:54:37
what I was saying about polyamory earlier, also goes towards
1:54:41
interpersonal relationships.
1:54:43
You get different things from different people, different people support you
1:54:47
in different aspects of your life.
1:54:48
So I have certain friends who are really good at supporting this
1:54:53
if I’m feeling this way or really want to go and do things and we
1:54:57
can do these things together.
1:54:58
And then I have some friends who I can just talk to endlessly for hours and it
1:55:04
can be incredibly rewarding to just sit and chat and deal with what's going on
1:55:11
or our thought process, how we're feeling about different, things the emotional
1:55:14
well-being of all of these things, how they interact with all these other things,
1:55:20
but friends are varied.
1:55:22
As I meet new people, I see all of these expertises that all these other
1:55:29
people have, I’m just like, I want to learn a little bit about that.
1:55:32
I want see what that's doing and sort of it broadens and
1:55:36
expands and broadens and expands.
1:55:37
It's great.
1:55:40
But yeah, my friends are genuinely supportive, and I have lost friendships,
1:55:45
I will say, due to coming out as trans and some people don't necessarily
1:55:51
always agree with, I have very different viewpoints on a lot of different topics.
1:55:58
Though we may talk about the conceptual idea of the LGBTQ community, everybody
1:56:07
who's involved in the community, and communities in general, everyone has
1:56:10
different varying points of view on what's important, how to navigate certain things.
1:56:18
I am, outspoken would be the wrong word, but I am more than willing to
1:56:24
put my opinion out there and that causes some friction sometimes.
1:56:28
So, it's a give-and-take sort of situation, especially with friends.
1:56:34
Well, and speaking of how you choose to be outspoken and you're so willing
1:56:38
to share your story, earlier in the interview, you had started to mention
1:56:43
your desire and how you're more active and now speaking with youth and sharing.
1:56:50
Can you share a little bit more about that and what led you to that and the
1:56:54
journey to then being able to be so open and what you're working on now?
1:56:59
Sure.
1:57:00
I would love to, actually.
1:57:02
This ties back to one of the earlier stories that I was talking about.
1:57:05
The moment when I was working with my colleague, and even though I had done all
1:57:12
of the mathematical and setup work for a system that we were putting in place
1:57:16
or a program we were putting in place in a school system, but anyone would
1:57:20
only interact directly with him, right?
1:57:25
It was a moment that exposed, for me especially, the fact that
1:57:34
for all intents and purposes, I hadn't changed, right?
1:57:40
Mentally, I was doing the same things.
1:57:41
Conversationally,
1:57:44
I may have altered some things, but for all intents and purposes, I was the same
1:57:49
exact person, just presenting female.
1:57:54
And whereas when I was presenting male, I had varied levels of success.
1:58:00
The concept of male privilege is a very real thing.
1:58:06
And then, just, I had only changed how I presented and how that directly
1:58:13
affected my ability to navigate the world
1:58:19
made me step back for a second, right?
1:58:24
And think about what does that generally mean?
1:58:29
How does my, our sexuality, how I present my gender, how does that affect
1:58:37
how I can interact with people, right?
1:58:43
In some ways that was a very telling moment where I was able to see, okay,
1:58:51
I’ve heard all of these stories where people have been marginalized due to
1:58:56
different things going on in their life: coming out as gay, talking to queer
1:59:01
youth, and seeing them kicked out of their houses or a violence coming onto
1:59:07
them in the similar way that I shared earlier of my own experience, right?
1:59:13
And I was starting to try and think about: what can I personally do?
1:59:19
And honestly this interview is me just getting my feet wet in this sort of realm.
1:59:25
I’m starting
1:59:28
to try and share my experiences.
1:59:32
Not only with corporate America but also with just my personal journey,
1:59:39
because I found out how important it was to have some form of representation,
1:59:49
to have somebody who was openly trans be able to speak out
1:59:56
when something was going wrong
1:59:59
was super empowering.
2:00:02
Seeing famous people who are trans and their general
2:00:05
acceptance in society is huge.
2:00:10
Most people would probably pull Laverne Cox as an example of somebody who is
2:00:14
very inspiring about being open about being trans and being able to have the
2:00:19
conversation about it, which may help and empower and also protect other
2:00:25
people who are in the community, who are going through some of those things.
2:00:29
So I personally have started doing more direct outreach and working with
2:00:35
different groups to try and provide
2:00:40
more representation in general, but also to push on some of those issues
2:00:46
that I started to experience much more strongly in the last few years and not
2:00:51
necessarily that I didn't experience them earlier, but that my understanding and
2:00:55
consciousness on them has been raised.
2:00:59
Most recently because of my experience working in school districts, I
2:01:07
consulted for a person on the school board for one of the local school groups and
2:01:16
they put together, or they were putting together a needed help understanding
2:01:21
and working through a trans policy.
2:01:26
They identify as a cis white male and they realized in trying to find
2:01:33
a way to do more outreach themselves, they were like, “I have no idea.
2:01:37
I don't know what this community is; I don't know how to interact with it.
2:01:42
What do I do?
2:01:43
I don't know anybody who is openly trans.
2:01:45
I don't know anybody who can talk me through some of these things, can
2:01:50
share a viewpoint on this story.” So
2:01:57
through some of my connections, they reached out to me and were
2:02:01
like, “hey so we're trying to put together some sort of policy.
2:02:05
I think that this is something incredibly important.
2:02:09
Can you help me understand this?
2:02:12
Can you help us put together a policy that is more representative of what
2:02:18
you would like to see in the world?” And that was kind of incredible.
2:02:24
So I sat down and I met with a bunch of people on that school board and we
2:02:29
just talked about my direct experience,
2:02:36
and then they started working together and with the help of some legal assistance
2:02:41
here also helped underwrite and set together an entire transgender and
2:02:48
gender non-conforming policy, and it was, going to those meetings and saying,
2:02:57
being the only trans person there at these meetings and voicing
2:03:04
my opinions on some of those things, that was huge.
2:03:07
Having somebody who in that space was representative, even if I’m not the
2:03:11
best representative, but somebody who identifies as part of that community
2:03:16
being there and being able to have some conversational points about the policy
2:03:21
itself: how it's orchestrated, how it's implemented, and how it interacts with
2:03:27
the students that are coming forward.
2:03:29
Like I said, I think that personally if there had been more information,
2:03:38
more support basically, for LGBTQ
2:03:42
people in my own life, my life may have been less traumatic, more different.
2:03:49
So I was able to help them put together a trans and non-gender conforming policy
2:03:55
and work with them through it and they ratified it in January of this year.
2:04:01
So they implemented a trans and gender or non-conforming gender policy here locally.
2:04:09
And I’m starting conversations, I’m trying to do more outreach on that and
2:04:14
make sure that there's representation out there for other people because just
2:04:20
being able to ask a question, right?
2:04:23
If you are questioning, you don't know, even if you don't agree with
2:04:28
somebody, it's nice to know that there's somebody you can ask about any of these
2:04:33
issues, somebody who may have a similar experience, who may have a similar
2:04:39
viewpoint, or may have experienced something in this sort of vein.
2:04:43
And I think that is incredibly important as we go forward.
2:04:48
My own experience is not representative of the experience of everyone, sure.
2:04:54
But that doesn't mean that I can't talk about it.
2:04:56
That doesn't mean that I can't engage with it.
2:04:59
And so,
2:05:03
in hoping to, and I look forward to interacting with more schools and
2:05:08
push towards them having a readily apparent policy in place, because that
2:05:18
means that people who are questioning or who see that, know that the
2:05:22
administration especially views it as, A] an important issue and B] it's
2:05:28
set out to say, okay, you're covered.
2:05:30
This is okay.
2:05:34
At LCC [Lane Community College] , for an example, something that I’m
2:05:37
starting to work on because I’m trying to get involved with student
2:05:40
government and with some of the LGBTQ+
2:05:44
groups there, they don't have a gender and gender non-conform, or
2:05:51
they don't have a trans or gender non-conforming policy on the books.
2:05:59
And that's kind of weird to me, right?
2:06:03
So, there haven't been any issues.
2:06:06
But I don't know what the administration's stance is.
2:06:08
If I go, as somebody female presenting, who was assigned male at birth, if
2:06:13
I go into a women's restroom, right?
2:06:17
Is that going to cause an issue?
2:06:21
Without any sort of policy there, it opens that door that it could,
2:06:28
and even if it hasn't yet,
2:06:32
because it's not stated in some form or another, I know a lot of other trans and
2:06:38
gender non-conforming people who look at that and it causes that bit of stress.
2:06:43
If I use the restroom that I identify with, could that cause an issue?
2:06:50
Could that cause problems?
2:06:51
So I’m starting to find different ways that I can work to minimize
2:06:56
that stress, to sort of make it much more clear that people in those
2:07:03
marginalized groups are protected.
2:07:05
And that's something that I’m personally working towards.
2:07:09
And yeah, that's my direct involvement right now.
2:07:14
So based on these experiences and your activism, during your lifetime
2:07:21
moving forward, do you foresee, are you optimistic in future systemic
2:07:26
changes, so it's not just about having these conversations but making
2:07:29
real policy changes, administrative support, those types of things.
2:07:35
Is that your one of your hopes and do you think that that
2:07:37
is something that will occur?
2:07:39
Yes.
2:07:41
I’m incredibly helpful towards it, but in my lifetime right there have
2:07:47
already been large systemic changes.
2:07:49
So when I openly identified as a gay male and I was engaged to another
2:07:55
gay male, we can now get married.
2:08:00
That's huge.
2:08:01
Towards societal and systemic changes,
2:08:06
the level of acceptance on that front even in the short time that I’ve been
2:08:10
alive has been huge, and I can only imagine, especially as some of these
2:08:17
voices come much more to the forefront.
2:08:19
We see this also in race issues and in different, other marginalized
2:08:25
groups speaking up and changing some of those cultures, well changing our
2:08:30
current climate and culture, pardon.
2:08:34
But, yes.
2:08:35
I do see some broader wide sweeping societal changes in that facet.
2:08:42
I see non-gendered, unisex,
2:08:48
whomever restrooms, and those are becoming more prevalent and that's something
2:08:54
that's small, but it means that people who are trans or don't feel comfortable
2:09:02
in any sort of way with who they are their body or don't necessarily want
2:09:06
to share that large restroom experience that we have here in the United
2:09:09
States can have that sort of space.
2:09:14
So people who -- I’ve seen a lot of implementation of different policies
2:09:19
already that allow people to use restrooms
2:09:25
for the gender that they are presenting and that is huge.
2:09:31
So, yes.
2:09:34
There's so much that's working towards that and also with health care shifts and
2:09:40
how those things happen, the pipeline for those and especially here
2:09:44
living in Oregon, right, you can put an x on your driver's license.
2:09:49
You can say that you don't identify as male or female on your driver's license.
2:09:55
That is huge.
2:09:57
The pipelines that you can use to change your name, change your gender, both state,
2:10:03
locally, and federally, are becoming more streamlined, especially here in Oregon.
2:10:09
I think that some of the broad swing and systemic changes that are coming
2:10:16
are happening rapidly, and it's
2:10:24
amazing.
2:10:29
So I’m curious, in terms of the LGBTQ+ community, you've discussed
2:10:37
your struggles and tribulations, but are there aspects that bring
2:10:42
you joy that you'd like to share?
2:10:47
So
2:10:53
many.
2:10:54
Just seeing, interacting with more people who identify within the community, seeing
2:11:01
more people who are outspoken about who they are, and being unapologetic
2:11:07
about how they present, and dealing with
2:11:12
things that are really close to their chest, close to their heart,
2:11:17
has been incredible to watch.
2:11:21
Whereas I’m relatively sure that ten years ago, or something like that, these
2:11:27
people wouldn't have a voice, wouldn't be able to talk about any of these things,
2:11:32
couldn't present how they desire to.
2:11:36
They're much more able to now.
2:11:38
And that's not to say necessarily that it's a safe thing to do.
2:11:45
There's still a lot of, there's still violence against people in the community
2:11:51
and especially to the trans community,
2:11:56
but
2:12:06
I see so much growth between connections that I’ve had and that I’ve
2:12:07
forged, even in the last few years.
2:12:07
I see so much growth in them and people's understanding of LGBTQ
2:12:12
issues and the freedom that some people who are in the community,
2:12:20
seeing them open up and be able to just exist with a much lower level of
2:12:25
stress, it's heartwarming in a huge way.
2:12:31
Yes, it absolutely brings me joy.
2:12:35
There's no question.
2:12:36
There's been some radical changes of it, and being involved in the community,
2:12:42
you're dealing with people, and sometimes that's positive and negative.
2:12:46
But absolutely, I’ve had a lot of joyous interactions with people and
2:12:53
seeing the community sort of band together over different things.
2:12:58
The way that
2:13:01
LGBTQ people when something comes up somebody who is non-binary when that
2:13:05
really wasn't a thing, some of the support that that immediately got.
2:13:09
People coming out as trans - some of the support that transgenderism
2:13:14
just got in general when it became more of a mainstream idea.
2:13:18
I mean that's huge
2:13:21
to see.
2:13:24
Of course there are issues here and there, but to just see how the community
2:13:30
sort of is becoming more accepting of new concepts as they come up and
2:13:36
how quickly those are added into the collective, I think is fantastic.
2:13:46
So earlier in sharing when you were talking about being in high school
2:13:56
and looking towards the future and thinking about how you didn't think
2:14:01
you've lived past your early 20s, not having direction in your life.
2:14:05
Now you're in your early 30s.
2:14:09
Can you now share what your hopes and dreams are and a future
2:14:13
direction for your life is?
2:14:15
What do you see for yourself, in this moment, in the future?
2:14:19
So that is a constant changing target, right.
2:14:24
Yeah, in my early 20s I had no idea.
2:14:27
I didn't think I was going to survive that long.
2:14:28
I didn't make long-term plans.
2:14:31
And now I have, and
2:14:40
I throw darts, like if you're playing a dartboard, I throw
2:14:42
a dart way, way out there.
2:14:43
I have a goal that's so far out that I may never get there, but at
2:14:47
least it directs what I’m doing.
2:14:50
Currently, I’m just recently returning to college after working for 10 years.
2:14:59
And getting back into college I’m thinking about what I could
2:15:03
possibly do, and the degree that I gave up was a biochemistry degree.
2:15:08
Honestly, it was a general science degree, but I was going towards
2:15:12
bioresource research and genomics and bioinformatics, but I’ve had some really
2:15:18
inspiring teachers here at Oregon State [University] , talked to them about
2:15:22
the biochemistry program, shifted that and gave that up for 10 years so I
2:15:27
could go work and I’m only now recently picking that back up and being like:
2:15:32
okay, I do want to finish this degree.
2:15:35
I do want to move forward with this now.
2:15:37
I’m in a very different place in my life and I’m like, okay.
2:15:42
My initial plans and thoughts are that I’ll finish my biochemistry degree
2:15:49
and then look towards maybe a master's in like biomedical sciences, which is
2:15:55
something that I’m incredibly interested in and it's a newer technology that's
2:15:59
coming forward, and in this last two months, I’ve really had exposure to
2:16:07
somebody who works in the medical field and being able to pick their brain
2:16:11
on what that pipeline is, I actually
2:16:18
changed some of my focus, and I’m now a double major pre-med, and I’m considering
2:16:24
going for my MD, partially because what I found out through them was that
2:16:32
because I’m able to freely talk about some of these things, because I have
2:16:35
some level of people skills, right, perhaps me going straight into research
2:16:41
is not necessarily the best thing.
2:16:45
So this person who's in the medical field, they see patients as their
2:16:50
standard job, but then they also help run different research groups and help out
2:16:58
with the research end of things as well.
2:17:00
So they're able to do both, and I was just like, I had no idea that
2:17:04
this was a possibility, so now I’m actively thinking about going for my
2:17:13
MD, and even if I don't make it to my MD,
2:17:17
I think through the connections that I make, through what I’ve learned,
2:17:19
how I navigate that course, I’ll at this point, even if I end up in
2:17:25
research, if I end up doing whatever, I think I’ll be in a better place.
2:17:30
So there's a lot of plans and goals.
2:17:34
In student government, looking at how I can help, what sort of outreach I can do.
2:17:41
That that also is just the moving target.
2:17:43
It expands as I give it time.
2:17:46
As you sort of water that it just sort of grows and so, yeah, my early 30s
2:17:52
I’m just like, we're gonna do this.
2:17:55
Okay.
2:17:56
And this.
2:17:57
Okay and this.
2:17:59
This isn't working out, so we'll go here and being more flexible about
2:18:05
where my life is taking me has made it so that I just absolutely have
2:18:12
dreams and plans that are huge and overarching, and I may never get to,
2:18:17
but I think that's part of what life is.
2:18:20
Do you think for the foreseeable future you might stay in this area
2:18:24
locally but potentially do you see yourself living elsewhere?
2:18:28
You've traveled so much.
2:18:30
Do you, kind of, you found your home here?
2:18:33
No.
2:18:36
I would love to say that I’ll be here.
2:18:40
I do like the communities that are here.
2:18:42
I do like the cities that are around here.
2:18:43
I’ve lived here off and on and I’ve returned to Oregon, and especially
2:18:47
the Willamette Valley multiple, multiple times throughout my life.
2:18:53
Do I think this is where I’ll end up?
2:18:55
Not necessarily.
2:18:58
Just looking at the MD part of things, likely I’ll end up going
2:19:04
to get my MD, the actual doctorate part of it, somewhere else.
2:19:11
I’m currently considering and looking at University of Washington,
2:19:18
in Denver, Colorado there's University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus
2:19:24
and they specialize in a lot of those things, and so there are just so many
2:19:32
options that I think it would be,
2:19:40
I don't think that it would be right for me to say, yeah I’m gonna
2:19:43
stay here forever, because I have traveled as much as I have and
2:19:47
because my life has changed as much as
2:19:52
it has.
2:19:52
What I’m going for, what I’m looking at right now is so different, that I
2:19:56
don't think that I’ll end up here, here.
2:20:00
I may return.
2:20:02
I likely will return especially as family happens and looking at
2:20:07
that going forward, I don't know.
2:20:11
So earlier you shared your life lessons that you've gained.
2:20:18
Would you like to talk more about those at all, or would you like to
2:20:23
share other life lessons, things - a typical question, things that you
2:20:26
would share with the youth and if you could talk to yourself back in high
2:20:31
school, anything now in hindsight, now thinking about what you’d like to share?
2:20:38
Yes.
2:20:38
Yes.
2:20:40
So there's a general overarching one, which is
2:20:45
all the mistakes that you've made, all the problems that you've had
2:20:49
in your life, all of them teach you little bits of something that allow
2:20:55
you to become the person that you are.
2:20:57
Cognitively, I know a lot of people who think about what if I had done
2:21:02
something different in the past, right?
2:21:06
You'd be a very different person.
2:21:08
Maybe nothing would change, but maybe everything would change.
2:21:13
I think the good and the bad of all of our lives, all of our experiences, helps
2:21:20
us have a more broad understanding.
2:21:22
And personally speaking, sometimes loads of trauma,
2:21:29
but allow us to have a very a different worldview.
2:21:34
We are the people that we are because of the things that we've experienced,
2:21:38
the people who have touched our lives, the things that we've chosen
2:21:41
to do, both positively and negatively.
2:21:45
We learn from sometimes from hurting people not to do that.
2:21:50
We learn from being hurt to be more vigilant on certain things.
2:21:56
We only learn through failure in a very real sense, and I think that that is
2:22:02
something that I would encourage everyone to do, is I put so many ideas out there.
2:22:11
I take so many steps in all these different directions, and sometimes I
2:22:15
fall, and I think that's okay, because every time you fall and pick yourself
2:22:23
up, you've learned a little bit more.
2:22:26
Maybe you shouldn't be walking down that path.
2:22:29
Maybe you are carrying so many things right now that you need to slow down.
2:22:37
Maybe you need to do invest in some of those things
2:22:41
and it's huge to be able to tell people of all different walks, all different ages,
2:22:49
especially the young, that it feels bad.
2:22:54
It can feel terrible.
2:22:55
It can be soul-crushing.
2:22:57
It can be just the worst to have something happen to you, to fail, to fall, to hurt,
2:23:09
but there's somewhere to go from there, right?
2:23:12
I understand that that's sort of an optimistic viewpoint, but
2:23:20
I’m more able to talk about trauma because I’ve experienced it.
2:23:24
I’m more able to talk about LGBTQ issues because I’ve experienced
2:23:28
positive and negative something.
2:23:30
I can talk about all of these things because sometimes
2:23:36
horrible things happened to me.
2:23:38
I can talk about domestic violence and domestic abuse with people and help them
2:23:44
come out of that, and I’ve helped a few friends who were in abusive relationships
2:23:49
and abusive situations get out of those situations now that I know a little
2:23:52
bit more of what I’m looking for.
2:23:56
It's not always my place to, but that rough understanding and that's
2:24:02
seeing those dangers and those things, you only really get by experiencing
2:24:09
it, experiencing it firsthand or second-hand, seeing your friends
2:24:14
go through it, all these things.
2:24:18
It's terrible sometimes, but absolutely, it sort of paves our way forward.
2:24:29
I would say that I’m an incredibly damaged person, right?
2:24:35
But that's because of the experiences that I’ve had.
2:24:39
And that allows me to be a stronger person in different ways.
2:24:47
And for you, based on your experiences and what you've shared, it sounds like, for
2:24:53
you, self-reflection, getting assistance through mental health issues, and then
2:25:00
for you it seems talking about it and sharing is part of your self-care,
2:25:04
is part of your part of your journey?
2:25:07
Very much.
2:25:09
So I process things in a very verbal sense even when I’m
2:25:14
not in this sort of situation.
2:25:18
I will talk myself through different things.
2:25:21
Sure.
2:25:21
I’ll create giant spreadsheets that lay out all these things and do a cost-benefit
2:25:26
analysis of whatever I’m going through and assign values to all these things,
2:25:31
but then, especially on the note of trauma and some of the darker things in
2:25:37
my life, one of the things that has been the most helpful for me personally is A]
2:25:44
finding other people who've experienced either similar trauma or are emotionally
2:25:49
able -- I always like to ask, especially to my friends because they know some
2:25:54
of the things that I go through, I will stop and I’ll ask, “hey, do you have
2:26:00
do you have the emotional capacity? Do you have the willingness or ability
2:26:05
to deal with this heavy topic or this trauma?” Before I engage with them on it.
2:26:11
Because that's self-care for me cannot be deleterious to somebody else or
2:26:17
should not be part of it, unless they are willing to take that on.
2:26:23
Yes, conversationally, and especially in this sort of capacity, because
2:26:28
I will say you've seen some of my emotional highs and lows in
2:26:31
talking about some of these things,
2:26:34
conversation especially, connection especially, are
2:26:38
large parts of my self-care.
2:26:41
Having people around in general is a large part of my self-care and knowing,
2:26:46
cognitively knowing, in the back of my mind a few people I can go to if something
2:26:53
goes completely tits up allows me to more fervently step forward, to tend to
2:27:03
my own wounds when I need to, to be able to take that moment to pause for myself
2:27:08
and be like: okay, what's going on?
2:27:11
How are you feeling about this?
2:27:13
How are you doing?
2:27:15
And these are tricks that you learn through therapy, through helping other
2:27:19
people out through these sorts of things, and reflecting and seeing what happens
2:27:25
when people don't do a lot of self-care, when they're burning themselves out a
2:27:32
candle from both sides and not taking that moment to be like, okay I need to
2:27:38
make sure that this doesn't burn all the way through that I’m left with nothing.
2:27:42
And part of that is having that support, having those people to talk
2:27:47
to, and having an outside voice to say, “you're doing something really stupid.”
2:27:53
Even if you don't listen to it, that momentary pause can be super helpful.
2:27:58
You may redirect some of your energy or go about it a different way.
2:28:02
So yeah, conversations and especially the connections are absolutely
2:28:08
large parts of my self-care.
2:28:11
So, to conclude, is there anything else that you would to share that we haven't
2:28:18
discussed, or anything that we have discussed that now that we're wrapping up
2:28:24
that you want to share a little bit more?
2:28:30
I’m sure there's like 38 million stories that I could share here, right?
2:28:38
I don't know necessarily what any of them are, as they contextually
2:28:44
come up, would be part of it.
2:28:47
And I would say, yes, there's more that I would want to share.
2:28:55
It doesn't necessarily occur to me right now what those things
2:28:57
should be or what they are.
2:29:01
But it's just been, life is such a weird little journey, and
2:29:10
who I thought I was, what I thought I was doing, every few years have changed.
2:29:17
I think that that is the way it is with a lot of people, whether they reflect
2:29:25
and see that for themselves or not.
2:29:27
Who we are in our 20s.
2:29:28
Who we are in our teens.
2:29:29
Who we are when we're five, that's part of who we are now,
2:29:35
but it's not all of who we are.
2:29:41
Any other concluding thoughts or you're just looking forward to
2:29:45
what comes next in in your life?
2:29:48
I think for my life, yeah, I’m absolutely looking forward to all sorts of things.
2:29:52
Like I said, I don't know necessarily what to share in this moment, because I have
2:29:58
a lot of other things that I could say,
2:30:03
all sorts of different things that could be unpacked in this moment, right.
2:30:09
I generally encourage people to voice the things that come up and especially
2:30:15
people of the LGBTQ community.
2:30:20
It's difficult to be alone.
2:30:24
Even if you're around people, sometimes you feel so very alone,
2:30:31
and that's not necessarily the case.
2:30:35
You may not understand or see how other people are trying to help you until
2:30:41
you're able to take a moment and step back and say, okay, why is this happening?
2:30:46
What's happening here?
2:30:48
Even in my lowest of lows,
2:30:53
in moments that I thought I was absolutely lost, absolutely isolated,
2:31:01
there's always a way forward.
2:31:05
Having survived three personal suicide attempts at different stages of my
2:31:14
life, knowing some people who are incredibly close to me, having them
2:31:22
understand that that is something that is in the back of my mind and knowing
2:31:28
that some of them have also tried at different points in their lives as well.
2:31:35
I guess if we have time I could discuss that entire thing, because
2:31:39
I think that that's a connected point that I can be honest about
2:31:43
that is relatively important, right.
2:31:50
I present as a very strong person, especially in like first
2:31:54
interactions and meeting me and seeing me as a character, right?
2:31:59
But there have been situations and points where I myself have
2:32:03
contemplated and gone through the motions, even, of attempting suicide.
2:32:10
And it is such a prevalent thing in our world, and especially as
2:32:15
people feel, different levels of hopelessness, me personally.
2:32:20
Powerlessness is
2:32:22
something that I hate for myself.
2:32:28
The secondary reason that I put so many options out there for myself is when
2:32:32
a door closes, I would for there to be somewhere else that I could keep going
2:32:37
towards, that I can keep moving forward.
2:32:41
In my personal situation at the end of the entire relationship with Dick,
2:32:48
right, I actively considered suicide.
2:32:52
My entire world was completely
2:32:56
shaken up in a way that is difficult to describe.
2:33:01
Every single thought process that I had, every single motivating thing had been
2:33:07
about, in some way or another, about those people, that relationship, that place.
2:33:12
And I reached a very dark place where I couldn't see a way forward.
2:33:22
I still have a scar from it actually, as a side note.
2:33:27
But I’m not a cutter.
2:33:31
I know quite a few people who are.
2:33:32
I didn't view it as something that, like I wasn't going to use a gun.
2:33:38
I didn't want to use drugs.
2:33:42
I took a knife and I actually inserted it below my ribs and
2:33:50
stabbed myself, and it was a very, it was a very weird experience.
2:33:59
When I say that I’ve tried multiple times, that's very true and I
2:34:05
tried in different ways, different times falling from great heights.
2:34:11
I’ve contemplated in my darkest hours vehicular suicide.
2:34:16
It's a thing, but in this instance,
2:34:22
the personal ability to end yourself is such an emotionally
2:34:30
and personally difficult thing.
2:34:36
To reach there is such a hard thing for me to even personally reflect
2:34:43
on right now I’m starting to get a little emotional about just even
2:34:49
the conversational thought of it, which is why I think it's important.
2:34:54
But I was able to insert a decent sized knife quite a bit into
2:35:00
my rib and abdominal cavity and start cutting myself open and just
2:35:10
to be there.
2:35:13
Society sometimes views suicide as this
2:35:19
this incredibly emotion-fueled thing, but sometimes it's what, it occurs
2:35:27
as the only option perceptively
2:35:32
to yourself.
2:35:36
And I will say I was lucky,
2:35:41
not necessarily that somebody else interrupted the entire thing, but I
2:35:47
didn't choose something that would have killed me quickly, right.
2:35:52
It was something that I actively had to do over a period of time
2:35:59
and so in doing that it was, at a certain point, it was more effort
2:36:07
to end myself than I wanted to put in that I stopped, and I didn't.
2:36:18
Now
2:36:23
if I want to joke about it right, I’ll say it really hurt, but
2:36:29
getting a knife past your flesh a little into your muscular level
2:36:34
and into yourself is such a, to be that hopeless, to be that, to feel
2:36:43
that helpless in your own life,
2:36:48
it's something that I want to share.
2:36:51
I as a person have been to that depth, has been to the darkness.
2:36:56
One of the previous times was I had a really good meal.
2:37:01
I was like, okay I’m done with this.
2:37:05
I’m through with this.
2:37:07
And I took a nap on a railroad,
2:37:13
a very much more passive way out.
2:37:19
And I woke up, and nothing had happened, and I got up and I walked off.
2:37:27
It's incredible,
2:37:31
when we talk about this fact that I was like, yeah I didn't
2:37:35
know where I was going in my 20s.
2:37:37
In some ways it's amazing that I’m still here, especially
2:37:44
when you hit emotional lows,
2:37:49
how important it is to have some of those self-care techniques, to have
2:37:56
some of these other people looking out for you can be a huge way forward,
2:38:02
and I’ve helped some of my friends who have gone through suicidal ideations
2:38:06
in that same sort of way like I described with, Dick, right, [who]
2:38:10
tried to commit suicide in front of us.
2:38:12
There wasn't anything necessarily in that moment besides stopping them
2:38:16
directly that we could have really done.
2:38:20
Reaching that level and that point was just
2:38:27
-- I’m glad that we have some of the help we do out there now.
2:38:31
I don't personally take any sort of medications or
2:38:34
anything for my depression and
2:38:39
I manage pretty well, but that's through getting a little bit of mental help.
2:38:44
That's through making sure that I have some mental
2:38:47
check-ins with a lot of people.
2:38:49
Mental health is not something that you necessarily see, like I described with
2:38:54
when I was suffering from domestic abuse.
2:38:58
It's not something that you necessarily will see unless
2:39:02
you're really paying attention.
2:39:04
And so I will share and I will beseech people to be a little bit
2:39:11
more aware of the people around
2:39:14
you.
2:39:14
I’ve gotten a little bit more depressed here and there.
2:39:17
I currently, I have some people who are hey you're acting differently,
2:39:24
will notice some sort of change, even if it's something minor
2:39:27
and they'll just ask about it.
2:39:29
And part of it is I have to train myself not to hide it,
2:39:37
and that is also something that is it's a mental thing where: I am so strong.
2:39:43
I can deal with these things, but sometimes we deal with them by not
2:39:49
ourselves dealing with them, bringing light to them and talking about some
2:39:55
of the things that are going on.
2:39:56
I can tell you that since that day, have I had some level of a
2:40:04
suicidal thought here and there?
2:40:05
Yeah.
2:40:07
Have I gotten back all the way down to that level where I actively considered it?
2:40:10
No.
2:40:12
But part of that is because
2:40:15
I’m much more open about how I’m doing in those situations.
2:40:21
And so I can deal with them earlier.
2:40:26
And I would just encourage people to be a little bit more open about the
2:40:31
things that are going on in their lives and how to interact with them directly.
2:40:39
Yeah, that's something that I would wish to share.
2:40:43
Well, thank you so much for all that you've shared, and thank you for your
2:40:49
willingness to be so vulnerable and to share your experiences and just
2:40:57
by sharing your story, it's such a powerful thing that you're doing, and
2:41:02
I think it'll help so many people.
2:41:04
So just, thank you so much.
2:41:05
I so appreciate you taking the time, thank you.
2:41:08
I hope it helps somebody
2:41:14
and to know that there are other people going through some of the same
2:41:17
things or who are curious about it and can see some of those strengths.
2:41:21
I think that's, thank you guys for doing what you're doing as well, because I
2:41:25
think getting more voices out there about all these things that are going
2:41:30
on can only help people in general.
2:41:34
Thank you, too.
2:41:35
Thank you so much.
