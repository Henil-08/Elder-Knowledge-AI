00:01
This is the interview with Lynn Burditt taking place on the 3rd of October, 1997.
00:08
Place of the interview is in Max Geier’s office at the
00:13
Corvallis Forestry Sciences Lab.
00:15
The interviewer is Max Geier.
00:18
Time of the interview is 5:00 in the afternoon.
00:20
We don’t have
00:23
a lot of time here because you’ve got to meet with the safety committee,
00:28
so I’d like to get started on this.
00:32
Fred said I could be late.
00:33
He said that was okay.
00:35
Okay, good.
00:36
I understand you took over as Blue River District Ranger in 1989.
00:41
Right.
00:42
Maybe you could start off here by just talking a little bit about
00:44
your personal background, where you came from and those kinds of things.
00:47
Okay.
00:49
I grew up in eastern Tennessee.
00:51
I think I’ve lived in about 17 different states, most of them
00:57
during the first part of my life.
01:00
I went to school at Syracuse College of Forestry, called Environmental
01:04
Sciences Forestry, and finished up at Iowa State with a degree in Forest
01:10
Management, Outdoor Recreation and Resource Management, in the mid-70s.
01:16
From there I worked up in Minnesota a bit.
01:20
It was a time when people couldn’t get on very much with the
01:24
Forest Service and Park Service.
01:25
I had this goal of working for the Park Service at the time.
01:30
I was one of those people who was not going to be a long-term hire.
01:35
I needed a little more security or something in my life.
01:37
So, I wound up working for an aerial survey company down in Houston,
01:41
Texas, doing geomagnetic surveys.
01:45
Basically, we did contour maps, going into the ground, looking at
01:51
the minerals or rock down there.
01:54
Somehow, through all that process,
01:58
people found me through 4 or 8 different addresses, and I got an offer to go to
02:03
the Clearwater National Forest, Palouse Ranger District, over in Idaho, in 1977.
02:11
I figured, “Better take that opportunity.” I’d gone to school, and I wanted to work
02:17
in forestry, so I needed to give it a try.
02:20
So, I moved up to the Moscow/Potlatch area in 1977 and
02:27
worked there for several years.
02:32
We [U.S. Forest Service] have a technical training program in the agency.
02:37
At the time there was one in Forest Engineering over here at Peavy [OSU
02:41
College of Forestry building] . I wound up applying for that program.
02:46
I’d been through a 10-week logging engineering course here.
02:49
Evidently, they didn’t have enough applicants so they were looking
02:54
for some more folks to apply, and outreached to several of us.
02:59
I applied and was selected, and wound up going through that.
03:03
Which was when?
03:04
That was in ‘80 and ‘81.
03:09
Actually, came here in September of ’79, yeah, September of ‘79.
03:15
It was probably one of the best things that I could have done, in two aspects.
03:24
One was that we worked on projects for a variety of forests, and during
03:28
the summer part of it, we went on assignments throughout the country.
03:34
I wound up spending a month down in North Carolina and Virginia country,
03:43
sometime up on the Mt. Hood National Forest, and also, a bit of time down
03:47
on the Shasta-Trinity in California.
03:50
It was a good chance for me to get the exposure that you don’t get the
03:55
same everywhere in the Forest Service.
03:58
The other part that was really
04:01
great learning experience and was part of that, the group of graduate
04:06
students was required to help teach the 10-week engineering institute
04:11
course, or a portion of that.
04:14
That entailed getting up in front of a group of 50 Forest Service
04:19
and BLM employees, and explaining aspects of various logging systems.
04:24
I’m a fairly shy person, and having to stand up in front of a group of 50
04:30
folks, mostly middle-aged men who had worked in the woods a long time, and
04:35
who looked at me and thought, “Who is this whipper-snapper young woman?” This
04:40
was a huge developmental experience, especially when I’m trying to explain
04:45
interlock mechanics, stuff like that.
04:49
It gave me
04:52
experience talking in front of groups and having to think on my feet.
04:56
That was real valuable in the future.
05:05
The other phenomenal thing was being in the right place at the time.
05:07
For me was it was also a time when it was really possible to get jobs back
05:11
out in the [Forest Service] system.
05:14
There was a chance to go on a detail up to Mount St. Helens on a volcano
05:19
recovery project in May of ’81.
05:23
That was the year after the volcano had erupted pretty significantly.
05:28
So, I got to spend from then until the end of August up working on the
05:36
mountain itself, and was involved with projects up on the Green River.
05:43
We flew in everyday by helicopter and then had to fly past the north
05:47
side of the crater, or we flew west of the volcano and, because our work
05:51
site was to the north, we got special dispensation to go next to the volcano
05:56
every day, which was pretty amazing.
06:00
Just being out in that setting,
06:04
where there had been such a powerful event occur, getting a sense of what was
06:09
the natural system, what had happened there, and how recovery was happening,
06:13
and the way in which the effects of the volcano had meandered around, was
06:22
just a pretty phenomenal experience.
06:24
I’ve always kind of viewed it as the highlight of my career, although
06:28
now it’s 16 years ago and it’s hard to even remember, but, emotionally,
06:33
I still have this sense of that.
06:36
From there I went to the Flathead National Forest in Montana, and
06:41
wound up in a variety of jobs.
06:42
I spent a couple of years as the “forest logging engineer,” which
06:47
was quite an interesting experience.
06:50
Being a woman, relatively young, and working for the Forest Service, were all
06:54
considered not necessarily strong sellers to the industry, which was a lot of the
07:01
work I had to do, working with them.
07:03
With a lot of men out in the forests, I got a chance to prove that I know
07:09
something about what I was doing.
07:13
After a couple years, I wound up at one of the districts as a “management
07:19
assistant,” and had responsibility for all the planning, presale, and layout
07:25
timber sale administration work on that district, and all the compliance with the
07:32
National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA].
07:34
I was there for about three years; a pretty controversial place,
07:38
with issues related to the grizzly bear, bull trout, scenic concerns;
07:45
just a wide range of concerns.
07:47
Should be about what, ‘83?
07:49
That was from ‘83 to the end of
07:55
‘86.
07:55
That’s when I first heard about hyporrheic zones.
07:58
Jack Stanford with Yellow Bay was doing a lot of work in that area.
08:04
I was acting District Ranger up at Hungry Horse District on the forest [Flathead
08:11
NF] . Then I was selected as District Ranger at Talley Lake District on the
08:16
forest, which is in Whitefish, Montana.
08:19
So, I was the ranger there from March of ‘87 through May of ‘89, when I
08:26
came to the Blue River District.
08:29
That
08:32
was a pretty good summary.
08:35
I’m going to back up
08:38
just real quick.
08:38
Where are you from originally?
08:39
I was born in Kentucky and grew up in Oakridge, Tennessee.
08:44
You grew up in Oakridge?
08:45
Yeah.
08:48
Okay.
08:48
Which was an interesting place to grow up, if you know anything about it.
08:51
I was going to ask about that.
08:54
Is that the site of
08:57
the Oak Ridge National Laboratories?
08:59
Yeah, the Oak Ridge National Laboratories are there now, but the
09:01
town was actually created during WWII.
09:04
It was one of the sites where they constructed parts for the atom bomb.
09:09
It’s kind of like the Tri-Cities area, Los Alamos, and Livermore.
09:14
So, the town didn’t actually exist before the war.
09:17
I’m
09:21
not sure why the Defense Department or whoever selected it, but they
09:25
came in and basically told the folks who were there, they could stay and
09:29
have a job, or they needed to leave.
09:32
It was
09:35
kind of a town created by bringing in a number of folks to work on that project.
09:41
The Manhattan Project?
09:45
Yeah.
09:45
It was a really an intriguing place, because you had this range of folks,
09:48
from relatively poor people who had lived in the country all their
09:54
life to this large number of Ph.Ds.
09:56
and scientists who were brought in.
09:58
Then it became kind of a science town.
10:05
It had a fairly high level of I.Q. There were fairly high expectations
10:10
on the kids in the schools.
10:12
Were
10:14
your parents involved in any of that?
10:15
My dad worked at one of the plants.
10:18
He was in the Navy and then he wound up working at what’s called Y-12.
10:24
I don’t know what that means.
10:25
That was one of the interesting parts of growing up there, is they
10:29
had Y-12, X-10, and K-25 names, and each plant had different rules.
10:34
In many towns like that, it’s fairly top secret, and so there’s little
10:40
badges and gates to go through and I had no idea what my dad did.
10:45
I just knew we would sometimes take him to work and there was a place we had to
10:49
stop, and he had to go through a number of other gates before he could get in.
10:55
It creates all kinds of unusual things.
10:58
I thought that was normal, growing up.
11:01
Was it high pressure to the students in school and scientific orientation?
11:05
Yeah, there was quite a bit around that, I think.
11:09
Definitely it was a community that had high expectations that way.
11:14
I’d say a large number of people with Ph.D.’s and definitely oriented
11:18
toward science and engineering.
11:20
Those were the basic goals of the town.
11:23
Was that an early interest when you were in school?
11:26
It must have been, because when I actually applied early to
11:30
college and went, I didn’t finish my senior year at high school.
11:35
I started school at the College of Environmental Science and Forestry,
11:39
so I must have wanted to do that.
11:41
I think where that really came from was we spent a lot of time in the
11:44
Smokeys [Great Smokey Mountains of Tennessee/North Carolina] when
11:44
I was a kid, and it was before it got quite as crowded as it is now.
11:50
I have lots of memories of being in the [Great] Smokey Mountains National Park
11:54
and then doing a lot of things on rivers.
11:57
Where
12:00
I decided to get into forestry and those kinds of fields, I couldn’t tell
12:07
you when that happened, but I know I must have wanted to because I picked
12:11
a pretty focused school to go to.
12:13
Sure.
12:14
I was going to ask you about that.
12:16
You said your early goal was to the Park Service, and you
12:19
shifted from that, correct?
12:22
Actually, it was an opportunity for employment.
12:24
I actually was in Forest,
12:30
Outdoor Recreation Resource Management
12:34
[U.S. Forest Service] . At that point in time, there were two ways you
12:36
could get on with the Forest Service.
12:38
It was what they called “The Roster,” and every so often, it
12:41
would open up and you could apply.
12:43
If you weren’t on “The Roster,” you couldn’t get a job.
12:45
With the Park Service, they were in the Department of Interior and they had a
12:49
different thing called the PACE, which was the Professional and Career Exam.
12:54
You had to take this exam, and if you scored a certain number
12:58
of points, and they had a distribution they would go with.
13:06
I believe the maximum you could get, if you weren’t a veteran, was like 100
13:10
points, and then if you were a veteran, of course, you could have points added on.
13:14
This was a time when there a number of veterans in that arena.
13:17
So, even at 100 points, you tended to be fairly low down the list.
13:22
And there wasn’t much hiring going on, so I just basically took the
13:27
first opportunity that came along and wound up heading more into forest
13:32
management then, instead of recreation.
13:34
Although, I have used that recreation background pretty extensively since.
13:45
Maybe you could talk a little bit about when you finished your graduate work.
13:54
What were your professional goals or priorities
13:58
that you had in mind?
13:58
Probably when I finished the graduate work, I was more along the lines of
14:05
seeing myself as a technical person,
14:11
having a skill that I could go out and do things in the field.
14:17
I had a fairly good background in silviculture, and I had this
14:23
goal of doing forest management.
14:25
If you understood how the forest worked and you could understand the operation
14:30
side of it, we could do a better job.
14:34
At the end of my graduate work here, I pretty much anticipated being in
14:39
that kind of technical capacity.
14:41
So,
14:44
I did that for several years as a forester, and actually
14:49
enjoyed it quite a bit.
14:52
I kind of had the luck of the draw, falling into opportunities, like with
14:58
the opportunity to go to St. Helens.
15:03
Then the Flathead [NF] job came up, which was one of the places
15:05
I just really wanted to get to.
15:09
When I was in that position, the forest logging engineer there was a person
15:13
who was on this district who had been in the job that they offered me, and
15:19
basically the ranger talked with my boss who must have said, “Looks like
15:23
a decent person, how about we make something work out?” I had never really
15:29
thought about going that direction,
15:32
I got called into my boss’s office, and he said, “Well, how would you
15:35
like this other job?” And that kind of set me on the path to being more
15:42
in the managerial end of things,
15:49
figuring out how to get a program going as opposed to being a
15:52
technical resource to people.
15:56
It sounds like there were some people that were kind of calling
15:59
your name at certain points.
16:00
Were there any people you would identify as kind of mentors, or even more kind of
16:05
intellectual or academic inspirations?
16:07
That’s a really good question.
16:14
Early on,
16:18
I guess some of what really strikes me in thinking about
16:25
early inspiration was Dr. John Gordon, who was at Iowa State when I was there.
16:31
I took several classes from him, and he was a fairly stimulating
16:36
professor to take classes from.
16:38
He was Head of Forest Science here [Oregon State University] for
16:40
a while, and then went to Yale.
16:56
I just really was stimulated by his way of thinking, and the way in which he
17:01
pushed people to learn and to inquire.
17:06
Found him really, really exciting.
17:08
It was also a time when some of the first kind of integrated
17:13
texts on ecology were coming out.
17:15
Eugene Odum’s book had just come out and
17:21
it was fairly revolutionary, even though it was kind of basic, but it was
17:25
beginning to get that sense of “what is ecology?” out in the thinking world.
17:31
I think those were real influential in terms of how I try to think
17:37
about things, which is a systems approach; what are the conflicts and
17:42
what things are happening within?
17:46
Early on, I would have to say those were things within the agency.
17:52
You know, it’s really hard for me to define a mentor.
17:56
I’ve had a number of people who’ve helped me do things.
18:11
But, I certainly would not have gotten to where I am without that set of
18:15
people who give you advice or coaches.
18:18
There’s
18:21
been a variety of those.
18:23
I’ve had a lot of people give me opportunities to try something
18:29
and either succeed or not.
18:31
That were willing to take risks for me, to give me that chance to either
18:37
demonstrate that I could do the job or that I wasn’t going to cut it.
18:41
When
18:44
I started in Idaho, I was one of the first woman foresters in that region.
18:51
There were two of us who started on the Clearwater [NF] at the same time.
18:55
We were pretty apart, so actually I didn’t have much contact with the other
19:00
woman, but it was in those early days when there weren’t many women in professional
19:07
positions or field-going positions.
19:13
It’s been an interesting experience along the way, and I think there were definitely
19:18
some key people along the way that were willing to take the risk of bucking
19:24
the old tradition of not necessarily
19:31
including women in the work force.
19:32
So, there were people willing to take that risk and try to make some things happen so
19:38
that I could demonstrate what I could do.
19:42
Did you ever encounter the point where there was a place you wanted to go
19:46
but where it seemed to be an obstacle?
19:47
It sounds like there was something helping you pull through.
19:55
This is one of those I probably wouldn’t want to have on a screen, but, when I
20:00
first started out, my sense was that there were, well, I’ll give an example
20:07
from the first party that I went to.
20:09
All the men were on one side and all the women were on the other side.
20:12
I walked in the door, and I didn’t know who to go talk to.
20:15
Because it was the men that I worked with, and they were the husbands of
20:17
the women that were there, and all the wives and the women were over here.
20:22
As for the women in the office, although they were excited to see me
20:27
start an employment, many of them, I started out a higher grade than most
20:33
of them would ever achieve, so there were interesting dynamics there.
20:36
The wives were all kind of nervous about the idea I’d be out in the
20:40
field with their husbands, so
20:43
it was an interesting experience overcoming that.
20:50
There were times when I wasn’t sure it was worth continuing in that vein.
20:58
There was a point during my early work there when I had a supervisor that
21:07
wasn’t real sure what to do with me.
21:09
I remember one of the things he suggested, was that I could type up
21:13
a paper he needed done for something.
21:18
At that point, I kind of said, “this is enough.” I went to the
21:21
ranger’s office and said, “This isn’t what I went to school for.
21:25
I’m not a highly-paid secretary and need to be doing some different things.
21:33
It changed at that point.
21:35
I did have another person on that district who really looked out for giving me good
21:41
training opportunities and experience.
21:43
So, I kind of had both things happen early on.
21:49
What were your outlooks, if you were having difficulties?
21:50
Were there were resources to draw on?
21:51
Yeah.
21:53
Who took the steps that helped me succeed, rather than threw up another barrier?
22:01
When I went to the ranger, he could have just said, “Well, too bad. This is what
22:06
we need to have you do.” In which case, I probably would have left the agency,
22:09
because I figured I had more talents than that particular approach to life.
22:15
But rather than doing that, he said, “Well, no. That’s
22:18
not what you should be doing.
22:20
We’ll head some things in a different way.”
22:23
So, one of these opportunities was you were kind of recruited
22:28
for this program at OSU?
22:29
Yeah.
22:29
What was your understanding of the priorities of the University
22:29
of Washington or Oregon State University and the forestry program
22:32
here that you were getting into?
22:32
Did you have any understanding of
22:55
it before that?
22:57
I probably didn’t have an extensive understanding, in that it, it was
23:01
really through the Forest Service program that I came to this, and
23:05
so I did know what program I was entering, which was Forest Engineering.
23:11
I
23:14
got a Masters in Forest Engineering.
23:18
My exposure to Oregon State University had primarily been during the
23:21
ten-week Forest Engineering Institute the prior winter when I was over
23:29
in Peavy Hall, and so you kind of interacted around a bit.
23:35
It was, of course, a huge forestry school, comparatively, and I knew a bit about the
23:40
mix of things, but my focus during that time was in that forest engineering arena,
23:47
because that’s the program I was in.
23:52
So you, it sounds to me like what you’re saying is that Oregon State University
23:55
and this area wasn’t necessarily your goal in the Forest Service.
23:59
No, it was pretty much opportunistic that I wound up here.
24:05
While you were here, was there anybody on the faculty here
24:08
that you were particularly
24:11
close to?
24:20
Probably the person who was the lead for our program, actually was a
24:23
Forest Service employee, Don Studier.
24:26
He provided kind of career counseling and advice and guidance for us, so he
24:31
probably was really our strongest linkage.
24:35
There was an individual who taught some classes for us, a fellow named Ed Striker.
24:41
He’s not over there any more.
24:46
He was an interesting resource in that he had previously worked for the
24:50
Forest Service and then had left and gone to work for a consulting firm.
24:54
That give
24:56
a good
24:59
sense of the range of opportunities that were out there.
25:02
Really wasn’t involved with this set of folks at all in that regard.
25:08
I do remember I took several classes in the fish and wildlife group, some
25:16
of which Stan Gregory now teaches.
25:18
He didn’t teach them at the time.
25:22
I also took a number of classes in soils.
25:25
I tried to do a minor in soils, and Stuart Childs was the
25:31
professor of a number of those.
25:32
Took soil physics and some things which, if I was in them, I kind of
25:36
questioned my ability to do them.
25:38
They got much more complicated than my mind got, and intriguingly enough, he
25:44
happens to be married to a person who’s now associate regional forester, so, kind
25:49
of an amazing way in which history goes.
25:53
Who was that?
25:54
His name is Stuart Childs.
25:56
Okay, Childs.
25:57
He’s been gone for some time, I believe.
26:01
Let’s see, you went up to
26:07
Mount St. Helens around that time and this group is very active up there
26:11
at that time, as I understand it.
26:11
Right.
26:11
When was your first encounter with the people involved with the Andrews?
26:15
Actually, probably my first encounter, and I didn’t know what it was, was when I took
26:19
a number of the fish and wildlife courses, “Stream Ecology” and some others, because
26:24
we did field work out at the Andrews.
26:29
Okay.
26:32
That’s really where my exposure came to that setting.
26:36
What I remember actually is long drives [Laughter].
26:42
I’m not sure that it really sank in on me, the Andrews Experimental
26:47
Forest, and what it was at the time.
26:49
When I applied for the Blue River [Ranger District] position, I knew
26:52
about the experimental forest and a bit about it, but I didn’t know
26:56
the depth of the program or the mix of activities that were going on.
27:02
So, probably my first exposure was in some of those stream ecology
27:06
classes actually out at the Andrews.
27:10
The exposure that I would have had to the folks up at St. Helens, I wouldn’t
27:13
have connected in the same way.
27:16
Can you recall anything about the Andrews site itself, besides the drive
27:19
down there in that first experience?
27:23
I remember going to Lookout Creek, the setting there and the old-growth
27:30
forest, the different kinds of
27:36
opportunities they were sharing with us, to understand
27:39
“constrained” and “unconstrained” stream reaches, and some of that.
27:45
The memory I have
27:48
of it was of a really neat place, a fairly
27:56
interesting setting.
27:59
It was probably the most time I had spent in an old-growth forest.
28:05
Given other places I had lived, it was a pretty amazing
28:09
experience for me in that regard.
28:12
I know from my own experience, it’s hard to remember people after the fact.
28:16
Were there any people at the Andrews that you know that were in those
28:21
classes?
28:22
That you recall?
28:24
I can’t recall, and I know that I’ve talked with Stan about the name of
28:27
the person who taught the course, and I can’t recall that today.
28:31
I can look it up for you.
28:32
No, that’s okay.
28:33
I’m just curious, because it is the impression that I’m looking for.
28:36
So
28:40
eventually, you are drawn back here to Blue River as the district ranger.
28:47
What was the appeal of that position at that time?
28:53
Well, this won’t be as misty sounding as it might be, but I had been on the
28:59
Flathead for about eight years, I kind of worked my way around and I was a
29:04
district ranger at a really neat place.
29:07
Whitefish is a nice town to live in, managed the biggest ski area
29:12
in the region, that kind of stuff.
29:14
You’ve got the Bob Marshall Wilderness and Glacier Park there, and so, my
29:19
thought was, why would I ever leave here?
29:22
Having been there for that length of time, I was getting a degree of pressure
29:28
to move on and to move up, including
29:34
potential opportunities to move into a regional office and kind of go
29:38
through the fast-track career approach.
29:42
My perspective was that I really liked the district ranger position,
29:46
because you have responsibility for an area of land and what happens
29:51
there, and you’re close to it.
29:54
You affect what happens, and yet you’re also in a role where you can affect, to
29:58
some degree, at least local policies.
30:01
It was a job that I was really enjoying and I didn’t want
30:05
to give it up that quickly.
30:08
At the time, most ranger positions were what we called GS-12’s, and to
30:15
get a 13, which would be a promotion, most of those were located in
30:20
western Oregon and Washington, and maybe some in northern California.
30:24
So, what I had actually done was to go through the book, and make a list of
30:30
the places that I would consider good places to live and interesting places
30:38
to work, that would be a promotion.
30:40
Then I watched as those got advertised, and I figured each
30:44
time one would be filled would be kind of a five-year rotation.
30:49
So, they advertised the Blue River [RD] and the Sweet Home
30:54
[RD] ranger jobs at the same time.
30:56
I had kind of looked at them because certainly the Willamette was one of
31:00
the forests that had popped onto that little highlight list I had made.
31:05
But I wasn’t really
31:09
that motivated to move at that point-in-time.
31:12
And there was a person on the forest [Willamette] who contacted me, and I
31:17
had worked with him in Idaho before.
31:20
So, he called me up to talk to me about the jobs, and
31:22
wouldn’t I want to consider it.
31:25
Who was that?
31:25
His name was Hank Ashton.
31:27
He was the administrative officer at the time.
31:31
I talked with him quite a bit, and it was kind of intriguing.
31:34
I thought, maybe I’ll apply.
31:38
I was going back- and-forth about it because the Flathead Valley
31:42
is a pretty neat place itself.
31:45
Then, one day, our forest supervisor had called the deputy supervisor
31:52
to ask what was going on, because Mike Kerrick, then the Willamette
31:57
supervisor, was with him down at a fire training session in Marana, Arizona.
32:02
Mike had asked him a few questions, and said, “Well, I hear she might apply.”
32:08
So, he called up wanting to know what’s going on, a “You don’t really want
32:13
to do this, do you?,” kind of thing.
32:15
That really intrigued me that Mike knew enough about me to ask
32:18
questions about me doing that.
32:21
So I thought, “Well, it’s a good opportunity to apply for a position.
32:27
I’m in a place that I love.
32:29
If I don’t get this job, I’m great with that, and if I do get it then,
32:35
that’s a good opportunity with the complexity of the program.”
32:40
At that point-in-time, as I mentioned, I had been in the right places at
32:44
the right times for things, and so I figured it would actually be a
32:47
good experience to not get a job.
32:55
That’s how I wound up applying.
32:58
At the time, I think you had to indicate whether you wanted to go to Sweet Home
33:02
or Blue River or would consider both, and I indicated that I would consider both,
33:07
but definitely would prefer Blue River.
33:10
That was geared totally towards the opportunity to work
33:14
with the research community.
33:17
At Tally Lake [Ranger District] , we had done some work with the folks out
33:21
of the Intermountain [Research] Station.
33:23
A fellow named Ray Scherer and others
33:28
worked in an area called Miller Creek where they’d had a fire study that
33:33
had gone in like 20 years before, and there was a number of plots and stuff.
33:40
We had a 20-year revisit kind of thing and it was an area they had
33:46
been looking at different kinds of treatments and regeneration responses.
33:51
In Miller Creek, they had happened to lay out all the plots and then they’d
33:54
had a fire go through unexpectedly.
33:57
So, you actually had a lot of pre-treatment data.
33:59
It wasn’t actually a natural fire, but it wasn’t your treatment, so they got
34:05
quite a bit of interesting material.
34:08
We were working on the 20-year visit, and I had done quite a bit of interacting.
34:16
We set up something we called the Miller Creek Demonstration Forest.
34:21
I was involved with developing the memorandum of understanding for that,
34:25
and how could we set this area aside for perpetuity so there was a way that the
34:32
value to the site could be protected.
34:34
That really got me pretty motivated, and when I had been over at Hungry Horse
34:40
for that short time as acting ranger.
34:42
That district has the Coram Experimental Forest.
34:45
Which one?
34:46
Coram, C-o-r-a-m.
34:48
I’d had a little bit of connection there with the research community, and I just
34:52
found it to be a really positive thing.
34:57
The notion of trying to understand the system and learn from it and being
35:00
involved with that, was really exciting.
35:04
So, one of the key attractions to the Blue River District is the
35:10
presence of the Andrews Experimental Forest, and the opportunity to
35:14
work with the research community.
35:18
It’s a fairly unique experience as I visit with other folks.
35:22
From what you’re saying, it sounds like it wasn’t so much the specific people at the
35:28
Andrews, it was the specific program with the concept of being district ranger where
35:32
there was a large research community.
35:36
Right.
35:40
That’s a little different for me, is not having been real, real
35:45
connected with the western slope [West of Cascade Range crest] . I’d
35:52
been more in the Intermountain area, so I knew of these folks.
35:57
I kind of knew who Jerry Franklin was and that kind of thing, but I’d been more
36:01
focused in a different setting, so it was more of the concept and the opportunity
36:07
to link between management and research.
36:09
That was really stimulating in my mind.
36:13
And I knew, of course, who Fred Swanson is.
36:16
I’d read a lot of his works and different things along the way.
36:21
You had been following the work of many of these people,
36:26
and it sounds like the connection with the Andrews was kind of general?
36:27
Yeah, it was fairly general.
36:29
It wasn’t like I had started out with this goal to get there.
36:34
Maybe you could talk just a little bit about, if you can recall at that
36:38
point-in-time, what your concept might have been of the appropriate
36:43
role for an experimental forest.
36:44
What is the purpose of an experimental forest within the Forest Service?
36:47
That’s a good question.
36:51
Well, at that point-in-time, I probably had a somewhat limited concept in that
36:59
many of the experimental forests I had been associated with or had some
37:04
awareness of, had a slightly or greatly less budget and opportunity for activity
37:12
than what you see at the Andrews.
37:15
I probably saw the role as the opportunity to generate new information.
37:23
I probably had a sense that it was more about scientists
37:27
going and doing their thing.
37:30
I didn’t have a really good understanding of the linkages that happened.
37:36
I was always somewhat intrigued in that people either seemed to really
37:40
like connecting with research.
37:42
Given
37:49
the time constraints here, I do not know if we should jump into this, but
37:53
I was going to ask you if you could think about when you first arrived as
37:57
District Manager in that community.
37:59
How would you characterize the condition of the Andrews in relation to the
38:03
rest of your concerns on the Blue River [Ranger District] at the time?
38:07
Maybe as a starting intro to that, I can say that I actually came a week early.
38:12
The forest supervisor wanted me to come before my official reporting
38:17
date, because there was going to be a big meeting between folks from Pacific
38:22
Northwest Research Station, Pacific Southwest [Research Station] , and
38:24
then, Region 5, and Region 6, and the agency [U.S. Forest Service] , and he
38:28
wanted me to have that opportunity to be involved with that as I came in.
38:34
So my first event, coming to the district, was a week-long meeting at
38:39
the Andrews with all these folks, that were, all these names you know, that I
38:43
had read publications of and all that.
38:46
Yeah.
38:46
It really stuck in my mind.
38:49
They were interacting, kind of trying to see where there might be
38:52
some linkages in the program, and it was just a great way to start out.
38:56
And the forest supervisor [Mike Kerrick] was very clear that part of his criteria
39:02
and selection with this, was somebody who wanted to work in this research thing
39:09
and be a strong partner in that mode.
39:12
Mike Kerrick, I really, really was impressed with his interest in pushing
39:18
that forward, because you could tell that there were times that he was
39:24
a little nervous about where things might go, but he was a major, major
39:27
supporter of the program there.
39:29
He was very clear to me about that.
39:32
So, my sense of how I looked at it, the Andrews and the connection with
39:38
the research-management partnership, was a key element of the job.
39:44
It was a primary focus that I’d be spending a lot of time on.
39:52
Actually, which I spend quite a bit of time with.
39:55
What was your perception at that time with the degree of public
40:00
interest in the Andrews and activities that were going on there?
40:05
When I first got there, I’m not sure that I have a good sense.
40:08
I knew there was a lot of classes that came through.
40:11
I wasn’t real aware of the other kinds of interests.
40:15
However, during that first year, I was just amazed by the number of
40:22
interactions either with political entities, international visitors, national
40:27
media, and others that came through.
40:32
I actually kind of pushed that we start doing a tracking system or
40:36
someway of summarizing who was coming through, because it was really a
40:40
phenomenal set of people that were coming in contact with that place
40:46
and then going out to other places.
40:48
I thought it was very interesting, first of all, to know what all that
40:51
was and then to be able to demonstrate to others the importance of that,
40:56
particularly during that time period.
40:58
This is when the spotted owl, of course, had really risen up, we’re moving into the
41:02
injunction, and I think we got quite a bit of attention during that period of time.
41:11
Within months of my arriving there, we had several different congressmen
41:14
who came out from the east coast and middle part of the country.
41:20
Folks who were looking to be policy-makers, and kind of set the stage.
41:26
I remember a number of different tours that we did, and the effort put into
41:32
how to, in a very short period of time, be able to communicate with them about
41:37
the value of what was going on there.
41:41
Not only what we were learning about, like spotted owls or old-growth
41:45
forests, but also the critical nature of data collection and
41:55
critical nature of having an integrated setting, and having a
42:00
long-term commitment to learning.
42:07
I can remember real vividly, one time we were walking down through Reference
42:11
Stand 2, where we had to open up a trail in there, and Jerry Franklin was walking
42:15
up the hill to meet us and the sun shone through just at the right moment.
42:19
[Trip with Congressman Peter DeFazio and another member of Congress] . It
42:19
was like the mountain had come to talk.
42:26
From my perspective, we immediately went into the fast track of the political
42:32
and national media interest news.
42:35
I don’t have a good sense of what it had been prior to that, but the
42:39
New York Times, the Washington Post, Seattle Times, Discovery Magazine.
42:45
We had folks coming to do a special for public television.
42:51
It just seemed like there was a fairly constant, fairly high
42:56
level of interest, in this place.
43:02
The political interests were coming through.
43:06
High profile position, you
43:12
probably felt then.
43:12
Yes.
43:12
Was that a surprise to you at that point?
43:13
It probably was.
43:14
And if I had realized the degree of the high-profile nature, I would
43:17
have never perceived myself as being one to step into that arena.
43:24
But it kind of developed over time.
43:27
It was sort of like, it’s here, and you gotta do it.
43:32
That had sort of been building because of the concerns about old growth and
43:38
the spotted owl, and the work that Steve Eubanks had been doing with
43:41
folks in terms of thinking about
43:47
how to work with riparian management areas and green tree
43:50
retention and down woody material.
43:55
The stage had been being set for when these became core issues, and this was a
44:00
place that people wanted to come learn.
44:04
What’s your recollection of concerns about facilities and accommodations and the
44:10
structure of the Andrews at that time?
44:12
When I first got here, everything [facilities] was
44:16
roof structures and trailers.
44:18
I believe we had gotten the first grant for the first quad,
44:23
and construction was starting.
44:28
The only facility out there basically was the snow-cat workshop.
44:36
I believe that next summer was when Art’s house got built, so in terms of facilities
44:43
infrastructure, it was fairly limited.
44:46
That was during that phase when the person [northern spotted owl field crew
44:50
member] stepped in the shower and the bathtub fell through the shower floor
44:51
[bathroom floor had rotted] . So, we’ve pretty much gone through a major growth
44:56
in terms of the infrastructure, to support people being able to live in
45:01
that setting and do work right there.
45:05
That’s all pretty much happened since around ‘89 until now, that major
45:12
construction and building occurred.
45:15
I’m also curious about your
45:21
take on the evolution of John Cissel’s role and the liaison role
45:28
[Position created to assist technology transfer and use of science [esp.
45:28
at HJA] in management]
45:28
. I have a take on that since I helped Art and Fred rewrite the position description.
45:34
My knowledge of what originally occurred, was that in the early ‘80s there had
45:41
been some work done that convinced the regional office [Region] that there
45:45
should be a position at Blue River associated with the Andrews that would be
45:50
called the H.J. Andrews Silviculturist.
45:55
Two different people filled that role over time.
45:59
My understanding is that initially, the Portland office [PNW Research Station]
46:02
funded the position, but there became
46:09
some confusion over who was funding what and why.
46:14
Part of that was geared towards the notion that there had been some
46:17
cutting that had gone on in the Andrews, and there was probably a
46:19
need to think about the silvicultural management of the forest over time.
46:27
Two folks who had been in that original position had worked pretty directly
46:31
with Art [McKee] , and helped set up the notebooks for each of the various stands
46:38
or studies that had happened out there.
46:40
The notebooks are in the library.
46:42
It was a fairly focused position really oriented towards the Andrews’ work.
46:49
I arrived in May of ’89, and it was a whirlwind kind of
46:54
situation in those next months.
46:57
The person who was in the role had some personal needs to not be in a commuting
47:04
mode, and so we worked to get him a position in the Eugene [Willamette
47:08
National Forest Supervisor] office.
47:10
As we were getting the opportunity to kind of rethink what we were going to do
47:15
once that placement was made, one of the things that had always stood out for me
47:19
from that first week, was the landscape issues, since that was what was going on.
47:26
One of the first things we had talked about as we stood on an overlook ridge,
47:30
was the Blue River Landscape Study.
47:33
The concept at that time was thinking about putting something that we called
47:41
the Cook-Quentin idea on the ground [Cook and Quentin Creek watersheds in
47:44
upper Blue River watershed] . That is the idea of aggregating cutting units
47:46
versus continuing to disperse them.
47:48
Putting that out there on the ground and learning from it.
47:53
That was sort of an initial concept that had been talked about as we went
47:59
through all the tours and the politics of different things, and started thinking
48:03
about how this stuff fit together.
48:05
It became really clear to me that the position as described, the H.J.
48:12
Andrews Silviculturist, was probably not the appropriate venue to do
48:16
the things we were moving into.
48:18
And so, working with Fred and Art, I rewrote the position description
48:26
in late ‘89, early ‘90, to be more the “research-liaison” approach.
48:34
One primary roles of that position was gonna be to kind of be a lead
48:40
person on getting this Blue River Landscape Study in place and happening.
48:48
Part of that was this notion that we’re not gonna answer all questions
48:52
of the world on this 15,700 acre watershed [Lookout Creek/Andrews
48:56
Forest] . So, we re-described what the position was, broadened its
49:02
roles, and looked at it having a wider range of things, then advertised it.
49:10
It was also an up-graded position.
49:12
The silviculturist job had been a GS-11, this was advertised as a GS-12.
49:18
We advertised it service-wide and got a lot of interest.
49:21
A number of people that were really intrigued by what that role might be.
49:25
When we had the cert [List of qualified people for
49:30
consideration] , Art, Fred, myself and Rolf Anderson, who was then on
49:34
the planning staff in the supervisor’s office, got together, went through
49:39
and made a determination of who we wanted to recommend for selection.
49:45
John’s [Cissel] work with a knowledge and understanding of forest planning
49:49
and modeling, and his interest in ecology, really stood out.
49:57
He’s been developing that role ever since he arrived, and
50:03
kind of broadening what it is.
50:05
He really functions as the day-to-day liaison with the Andrews Forest
50:09
itself, coordinating various projects that we have going on, and kind of
50:13
bridging that gap between the research community and management end of things.
50:19
We’ve been able to develop and implement a number of projects that
50:24
have been concepts for a long time.
50:26
The long-term ecosystem productivity study, the young stand thinning
50:31
and diversity study; all these were things that were sort of ideas out
50:35
there that he’s been able to push forward and help make into a reality.
50:42
I’m just curious, did you have any models of that kind of a position
50:47
that you drew on, or was it just kind of designed uniquely for this case?
50:50
I really didn’t have any models for that kind of position.
50:53
Probably, the only model was the Andrews silviculturist position.
51:02
That would have been the model, because I think when they created it, it might have
51:05
been one of the first with the idea that we’re going to invest dollars into this
51:11
focused person, whose role as a National Forest system employee, to help make
51:17
this happen on an experimental forest.
51:21
I see it as a really key position in helping continue that bridge between
51:26
research and management, because there are different things that drive the
51:31
two kind of thoughts of how the world works, what we’re there to do, and
51:37
there’s always those little opportunities for communication gaps [between land
51:41
managers and research community] and, and that position bridges between that.
51:45
I’d like to say we were really foresighted and knew what we were doing,
51:51
but….
51:52
An important point there is that you were in a lot national forests
51:55
and had a pretty wide- ranging experience before you came here.
51:57
What is your perception of the research-management situation
52:04
here in Region 6 as compared with other places you’ve been?
52:09
My sense is that the Pacific Northwest Research Station is quite a bit
52:15
larger than many of the other ones [research stations] , and much more
52:18
active in terms of what they’re doing.
52:22
Because of that, I think they’ve had access to more
52:25
resources to be more involved.
52:31
My feeling would be, that part of that, at least in this particular setting,
52:35
is that linkage with the long-term ecosystem research network which
52:43
integrates not only Forest Service scientists, but scientists from a
52:48
number of universities with management.
52:50
This place is substantially
52:57
larger and more in-depth in terms of what it’s able to accomplish
53:01
than it is in many other places.
53:03
I also see that’s changing.
53:05
There’s been a real effort since the late ‘80s to build rapport
53:11
between research and management.
53:13
In fact, several task group efforts have come out, one just recently.
53:18
I can send you a little pamphlet about collaborating between
53:21
research and management.
53:23
What they’re trying to do is help researchers understand what management
53:26
is about, and help management understand what researchers are about.
53:32
My sense would be, to make a better connection between those two branches
53:36
of the agency, so we can do better research and get projects implemented,
53:41
and do things in a way managers learn and accept, and that tech transfer
53:48
[technology transfer – communication of lessons from science to users of
53:49
the information] happens more rapidly.
53:50
I think that I see a focus in the agency on really building that connection
53:57
more strongly than it has been.
54:01
Yeah, I’d like to see that.
54:01
I talked a little bit with Cindy Miner about that.
54:03
Okay.
54:05
I can send those up to you.
54:07
I didn’t think to bring them today.
54:12
Kind of a peripheral issue here is, how you would characterize OSU’s role
54:16
in relation to research-management, as compared to other places that
54:19
you might have been when there was university involvement?
54:24
Actually, it’s kind of been different at each place.
54:26
When I was working at the Palouse District and we had that connection with
54:32
the University of Idaho, I was probably in a role where I wasn’t real integrated
54:37
with it; I just knew it was going on.
54:40
I saw there was certainly an active connection, between at least our
54:43
district and the research community and the University of Idaho, because
54:48
the district ranger at the district also had an office in Moscow.
54:53
That was part of his role to be linked up there.
54:56
There was a connection there, although as an employee, I
55:00
wasn’t really linked with it.
55:03
But the school of forestry [Univ.
55:06
of Idaho] was connected up.
55:10
On the Flathead, the University of Montana was one you would
55:13
see much more linked through the school forest and different things.
55:19
I was always aware of some of those connections like the Yellow Bay
55:22
Biological Station with Jack Stanford.
55:24
That was another thing, but that wasn’t forestry, in kind of a different arena.
55:29
What I see with Oregon State University that’s relatively unique in my
55:35
experience, I couldn’t necessarily compare it to others, is the variety
55:42
and depth of involvement throughout the university with the Andrews program.
55:47
The number of folks from different colleges and departments who come together
55:51
and are actually trying to do their own work, and yet also be involved in more
55:56
of an integrated fashion, and try to do value-added work because of that.
56:02
It is an experience that I don’t think you see many places.
56:06
I do think that the LTER grant is probably fairly key to that, having
56:11
seed money that allows people to say it makes sense to them to spend time
56:18
together and really try and push that.
56:23
The number of people who are doing work in this venue and working
56:28
together, is just an order of magnitude
56:34
different than I’ve seen in other places.
56:37
That’s partly due to the size of the school as well.
56:40
Maybe you
56:43
could
56:45
give me your impressions of the LTER meetings as compared to other
56:49
efforts to try to integrate work?
56:52
Well my first experience with an LTER meeting was, whoa,
56:55
this is kind of intriguing.
56:57
People wandered in when they wanted to, and they wandered out, and there’d
57:00
be all kinds of discussion topics.
57:02
It was really an interesting flow of interactions with the idea of figuring
57:10
out how to integrate and do work.
57:12
It was sort of like there were never the same people in the
57:15
room for five minutes, it seemed.
57:19
I see them being sort of that linchpin, a reason that people come together
57:26
and hit on some real core issues.
57:29
I don’t see them, necessarily the meeting itself, really addressing those
57:34
issues so much as trying to identify something we ought to work on together.
57:38
We need a group to go do that.
57:41
I see that as a really effective way of having inclusive involvement.
57:47
They’re open meetings.
57:48
Anybody can come to them.
57:50
There’s been a strong effort to bring in people from other locations, University
57:55
of Oregon, Chemeketa [Community College] , and different places.
57:58
It provides that opportunity for folks to make a connection with someone that
58:02
perhaps they may know who they are, or might know what they’re doing, but may
58:08
have not linked up, and they can make that link in person, or to come together
58:13
around issues of concern to them.
58:15
So, I see the meetings really serving a good purpose in that way.
58:20
I think it’s been really valuable, the science hour that’s been added,
58:26
because it allows us to not get off too much into “just business” kind of
58:30
stuff, and lose track of why are we there. And the focus of the science
58:35
hour and sharing with each other,
58:39
gives people an opportunity to share their work, and for people to really remember
58:44
what this is all about, that it’s not just an administrative kind of structure.
58:49
I
58:58
was curious if, as district ranger, you’ve ever encountered situations
59:01
where those LTER meetings help you resolve or at least identify, problems
59:05
areas that needed to be addressed.
59:09
Relative to the district itself,
59:15
it’d be hard for me to say that the meetings themselves do, although
59:17
we’re fairly integral in them.
59:20
To some degree they do in that a number of the activities that we’re jointly
59:26
involved with, which are not necessarily basic research, but like the “young
59:30
stand thinning and diversity study,” that kind of thing, we’re sharing
59:36
information there that we can learn, who’s got a concern, who wants to be
59:40
involved, and so that’s helped us be able to do things to get things moved
59:44
forward and get implemented. The other kinds of purposes that it served, is as
59:50
an example, concerns about road management on the Andrews. It’s a place where we
59:54
can go and connect with most of the folks that we might need to interact with.
1:00:01
They’ve also been really useful in regard to, like the Blue River Landscape
1:00:10
management and monitoring strategy we’re trying to get implemented.
1:00:13
It’s been a place where we can bring forward concepts we’re working on,
1:00:17
to say here’s what we’re doing.
1:00:19
Needing to have that interaction and get people engaged.
1:00:23
It’s been a way to be able to do that.
1:00:26
It’s helped in all those ways.
1:00:29
The other way that it’s really helped, is I think, that many times, certainly
1:00:34
not every meeting, but many times, it really stimulates some new thinking.
1:00:38
You get a discussion going or somebody’s got a new proposal that they’re making,
1:00:43
and it can help stimulate an idea or put a kernel of thought in that
1:00:49
later comes back in a different way.
1:00:54
Those are things that I can think
1:00:57
of.
1:00:57
What level of involvement is the district expected to have
1:01:03
in these kinds of exchanges?
1:01:05
We have a real mix.
1:01:07
When I first arrived, we had the Andrews’ position, and then, district staff.
1:01:12
We were trying to be involved in different ways, more with
1:01:15
installation kinds of activities, like the log decomposition study.
1:01:21
District staff were really involved in putting together the timber sale
1:01:24
contract and doing the administration that allowed that project to be implemented.
1:01:30
They sort of helped with how the logs got placed.
1:01:34
Mark [Harmon] designed it, and then people had to do that.
1:01:36
Others were involved in the Quartz Creek project with Stan Gregory, with
1:01:42
again the design and implementation, and ways to find funding for that.
1:01:48
What we’ve tried to do since that time is do what we can to more
1:01:54
inculcate it throughout the district.
1:01:58
One of the things that we did, I believe it was in ‘92, because John’s
1:02:05
role was somewhat different than the silviculturist role had been before,
1:02:08
and for several other reasons, we also then created a position under
1:02:12
John, which is a silviculturist.
1:02:15
That’s what Jim Mayo is in, and he has kind of an oddball job, in that he’s
1:02:19
half with what we call the Cascade Center, he does 30% of his work with
1:02:24
our planning and resource group, and 20% of his work with our reforestation
1:02:29
and timber stand and improvement group.
1:02:33
Jim has to report to a lot of different groups.
1:02:36
His role is to do a lot of the silviculture aspects, and as an example,
1:02:42
he’s the project manager for the “young stand thinning and diversity study.” With
1:02:46
our long-term ecosystem productivity site, we found an employee to be the project
1:02:52
manager for that, trying to find people who might take leads on certain individual
1:02:58
projects, and get them more engaged in things and also spread out the work.
1:03:05
Another thing that we did in 1991 when we realized that a lot of the
1:03:10
work we were doing and a lot of the info we were sharing wasn’t just
1:03:13
limited to the Andrews Forest, is we did create the concept of the Cascade
1:03:18
Center for Ecosystem Management.
1:03:22
One of our tasks back then was to kind of inculcate that
1:03:26
concept in different places.
1:03:28
At
1:03:30
the district level, one of the things that we try to do is when we answer the
1:03:34
phone, we say “Blue River Ranger District and Cascade Center.” We’ve got stationary
1:03:39
that has the three entities on it for things that go out under that letterhead.
1:03:46
We also added a position that was really focused on doing the GIS work for the
1:03:52
Cascade Center projects. We’re now moving that one back into the mainstream of
1:03:57
the district, and kind of again trying to integrate all of the work there.
1:04:02
But we’re trying to do what we can to build the notion for folks that this is
1:04:07
all of our jobs, as opposed to people seeing it as they have their jobs to
1:04:11
do, and the Andrews is those folks “over there.” We’ve had mixed success as
1:04:24
you can
1:04:31
imagine.
1:04:31
Would talk a little bit about the evolution of the concept for the
1:04:36
Cascade Center for Ecosystem Management?
1:04:41
I think part of where that came from was, as we were doing a lot of these tours,
1:04:46
one of the things that was really neat about them, is in the morning, we could
1:04:50
go to the Andrews and talk some about streams and long-term data collection.
1:04:55
We’d go to the log decomposition site because that was always
1:04:58
a neat one for people to see.
1:05:01
We could spend a morning on the experimental forest, and then go
1:05:04
out in the afternoon to sites on the district where we were implementing
1:05:08
some of the concepts, and talk about here’s this idea over here, and here
1:05:14
you’re seeing it in action, and really get into discussions with people.
1:05:18
It was starting to be evident that there was more happening outside that
1:05:25
vein, and that we aren’t answering these questions on this small piece of real
1:05:29
estate, that it has certain purposes.
1:05:31
Really, there was a lot going on outside of that.
1:05:35
So, we needed to have a way to communicate to folks that it’s something other
1:05:39
than just the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest program, and how could we do that.
1:05:45
Another thing going on at that time was you had things being generated,
1:05:51
like the Blue Mountains Institute, and the concept of institutes or centers.
1:06:01
As we were looking for how would we name what this entity, and what would
1:06:06
it be like, we had a lot of discussions about it and we came up with Cascade
1:06:11
Center for Ecosystem Management.
1:06:14
The “Center” word kind of came along with the institute thing. But the idea is
1:06:18
that it’s a concept or a program of work.
1:06:21
It’s not a place, it’s not a building that you go to.
1:06:25
I was really thinking more about, at that time, what was
1:06:29
our idea of adaptive management.
1:06:33
In ’91, we had come out with some notions around how we would ask questions.
1:06:38
Based on gathering up what are research questions and management questions
1:06:42
and public questions, it was about how we decide to answer those questions.
1:06:46
Then, what projects do you implement that would help answer it, how
1:06:50
do you learn from that, and then how do you feed that back in?
1:06:54
We were trying to build that kind of system, and
1:06:59
find a way to phrase that for folks, and describe different components of
1:07:04
the program, such as basic research on the Andrews, applied research,
1:07:09
demonstration opportunities, and education opportunities.
1:07:14
As we sorted through that, that’s when we pretty much came up with
1:07:17
this notion of the Cascade Center.
1:07:19
It’s just sort of a way of putting some framework around a larger program.
1:07:25
Who was
1:07:27
the working team on that?
1:07:27
You?
1:07:27
That was pretty much myself, Fred, Art and John Cissel, at the time.
1:07:32
And I know we got a lot of insights from Rolf Anderson.
1:07:39
We really
1:07:42
had come up with this notion prior to Darrel Kenops, the current forest
1:07:46
supervisor arriving, because I remember we had our brochure for a couple things
1:07:51
kind of laid out, and he rewrote the brochures for us when he arrived.
1:07:59
He really bought into the concept, and the Andrews program kind of followed where
1:08:09
Mike Kerrick had left off, with him being a major supporter of this partnership
1:08:14
and the work that’s done there, and he has continued to support us with
1:08:22
the need for John Cissel’s position.
1:08:25
Interestingly, when it was the “Silviculturist” position, we funded
1:08:28
it primarily through silviculture-type dollars. When we went to this broader
1:08:33
concept, one thing we struggled with on the forest [Will NF] , is that it
1:08:38
wasn’t just a silviculture job, and so we had to find a mechanism to how we
1:08:43
compete for funding on the forest level.
1:08:47
That was one thing Rolf Anderson really helped us with.
1:08:50
He was willing to be the staff officer on the forest who would
1:08:53
sponsor this in the budgeting process.
1:08:58
We needed to get funds from all the various “fund code” areas, because of
1:09:03
how we fund as functional areas, we needed somebody who could help say,
1:09:10
we need to pull these little bits from each to fund this Cascade Center.
1:09:16
As we went through downsizing in the early ‘90s and had some really
1:09:21
difficult years, many people in the forest [Willamette] saw the Cascade
1:09:27
Center as perhaps a discretionary item.
1:09:31
And there were several folks who were really supportive that know this is key
1:09:37
and fundamental to our program of work.
1:09:40
Again, Darrel Kenops followed along Mike Kerrick’s footsteps as did the
1:09:45
deputy supervisor then, John Nelson, and then, our new deputy, Rick Stemm,
1:09:50
have all supported that this needs to be part of our program of work.
1:09:54
This is important, as we do need to keep some level of stable funding
1:09:59
going to the Cascade Center program.
1:10:02
Sounds like what you’re saying is that a budget cut was a very possible
1:10:08
threat to John Cissel’s position too.
1:10:11
The potential to have the funding, definitely there were some people to
1:10:14
whom it was hard to see how funding this position helps meet our targets.
1:10:21
We have hard targets to produce fish structures or to produce timber volume
1:10:26
or to produce recreation visitor days, and how does this position of
1:10:30
John’s [Cissel] and the work we’re doing there, help us meet those?
1:10:35
One of the ways that we tried to convey things, is that one of our
1:10:40
roles that John and I have talked about, is to generate information.
1:10:44
That is part of our responsibility, because of this setting that we
1:10:49
have is generating new knowledge, and that is helping over time to
1:10:54
meet those goals and objectives.
1:10:57
But, our forest went from having 770 permanent employees to now having about
1:11:02
410, and we did that very painfully.
1:11:07
When you had to go through the thought process of eliminating positions and
1:11:13
having people find their position on a surplus list, and we also did a
1:11:17
reduction-in-force, it was certainly quite controversial for folks.
1:11:23
What is “necessary work”?
1:11:25
That might be kind of a good way to address this next question I had in mind.
1:11:32
How does your perception of the kinds of management problems that seemed most
1:11:35
urgent in the last decade of your work up there, and the way in which that
1:11:40
might evolve, relate to the kinds of work that scientists at the Andrews do?
1:11:46
That’s a good, good question.
1:11:51
I would start by saying that one of the ways I try to view our role,
1:11:58
or it’s my hope, that to the degree possible, what we’re really trying
1:12:01
to answer the questions that are likely to come up 20 years from now.
1:12:06
You know, 10, 15, 20 years away, as opposed to the urgent questions of today.
1:12:14
Some of the ways in which I think to some degree has been played out in the
1:12:18
Andrews history, thinking back to Eric Forsman and the spotted owl, the early
1:12:24
hooting up at Box Canyon on the south end of the district in the early ‘70s, and
1:12:29
the work that then went into beginning to understand old growth and the relationship
1:12:37
of those old-growth dependent species.
1:12:40
That kind of led up to having some base of information available
1:12:44
when that became a major issue.
1:12:47
Another example of that to me, is the work that was done around riparian
1:12:51
management and the work the [Willamette] Forest had done with the Andrews
1:12:55
group and with Stan Gregory and other folks, to develop a management area
1:13:01
and riparian management guidelines in our forest plan that came out in 1990.
1:13:07
A lot of that work became some of the basis used in the FEMAT Report
1:13:13
and in the Northwest Forest Plan, and then, you know, those guidelines
1:13:17
were recently published in Japanese.
1:13:19
Those are examples to me of things that were fairly critical management
1:13:25
issues on which there was some level of information available to help address.
1:13:33
Other things I think
1:13:37
where the Andrews connection has been an interesting link, happened on a field trip
1:13:43
where we talked about the Cook-Quentin Study and idea of “minimum fragmentation,”
1:13:47
and trying to maintain future options that minimize the impact of today’s practices
1:13:52
on ecologically-significant old-growth [Field trip with staff members of the U.S.
1:13:54
House of Representatives Appropriations Committee] . Then, when section 318
1:13:57
language [House appropriations for Forest Service] was written, it says “minimize
1:14:00
fragmentation,” it’s kind of like, whoa.
1:14:02
It’s not necessarily that this came directly from that field trip, but it
1:14:07
appears very correlated that information we were sharing was, that level of
1:14:14
information, was being used to help set a framework for helping us maintain options.
1:14:22
Actually, as we had a number of tours in the early ‘90s with industry groups
1:14:27
and with environmental groups, one of the questions that came up was,
1:14:36
“How can we be changing the paradigm of forest management when we’ve spent
1:14:40
so many years trying to understand the even-age management system?”
1:14:46
We would have a lot of discussions about that on those trips,
1:14:49
that we didn’t know everything.
1:14:51
[Not enough to make big, proposed changes in management practices]
1:14:51
. We knew some basics, we knew enough to set some frameworks
1:14:58
needed to continue learning, but we probably weren’t going to have all the
1:15:02
answers before we implemented things.
1:15:05
And there were some of those trips where some fairly contentious discussions went
1:15:10
on, particularly around the idea of trying to retain snags or the idea of leaving
1:15:17
large woody debris [on the ground] . It was a very challenging time for people to
1:15:23
understand; what is the value of leaving this large tree out there in the forest
1:15:29
when it might be worth $5,000 at the mill?
1:15:35
I saw us in the exact middle of that debate.
1:15:39
It was one of the roles we played in that transition because of the ability to
1:15:45
look at the research setting and then go out on the rest of the district and show
1:15:49
people here is an application, and then talk about it and have the discussions.
1:15:59
We were put in some pretty challenging positions.
1:16:02
There were a lot of people who didn’t care for what we were
1:16:05
trying to implement at the district level from the research learning.
1:16:10
They felt like we didn’t know enough yet.
1:16:13
One of the ways that I saw our role as a district was carrying forward
1:16:19
some of the legacy Steve Eubanks left.
1:16:22
It was partly our role to take the ideas and concepts and to start thinking about
1:16:29
how do you apply those out on the ground.
1:16:31
Can you operationally do it?
1:16:33
It might be a nice idea to leave large woody material, but
1:16:42
how do you deal with safety issues and that kind of thing.
1:16:45
And so, partly our role was to take those concepts, implement them,
1:16:50
think about what works and what doesn’t, and tweak that a little bit.
1:16:54
One of the good examples of tweaking that happened was from the early work on the
1:16:59
large woody debris in our forest plan [Willamette NF] . There was a standard
1:17:03
guideline that said we would leave eight to 15 pieces of material at least 20
1:17:08
feet long and of a certain diameter.
1:17:10
Well, you get out on the ground and you have your timber sale, and you’ve got a
1:17:15
tree laying there that’s 100 feet long, and the purchaser asks, “So, is that five
1:17:20
pieces or is that one?” Well, depending on who you are affects what your answer is.
1:17:26
Some of our wildlife folks would say, “Well, of course it’s one piece.” Then,
1:17:30
from the purchaser’s viewpoint, they say, “Okay, I’m going to go down that
1:17:33
log and I’m going to cut it into five chunks because it only needs to be 20
1:17:37
feet, so then I’ve got five credits.” So,
1:17:41
one thing we did pretty quickly was put together a team that looked at how
1:17:45
we adapt that guideline to better meet what we really need to do on the ground.
1:17:52
That was a team that Mark [Harmon] participated in.
1:17:55
We had folks from the research community and management out there looking at
1:17:59
it with purchasers, and we actually tried a different approach on one of
1:18:04
our sales where we went back through all our plant association information,
1:18:11
and checked the ranges you would find in different plant associations.
1:18:15
Then we re-described it to say that you would have certain number of lineal
1:18:19
feet of large woody material out there.
1:18:22
So, instead of eight to 15 pieces, well, do I want to leave 15 or eight?
1:18:28
If I’m the purchaser, I want to leave eight, if I’m the wildlife
1:18:30
biologist, I want to leave 15.
1:18:31
Well, instead of doing that, you would say we want 300 lineal
1:18:35
feet per acre, as an example.
1:18:37
And so, the folks worked on how we really meet what we want to do out there and
1:18:43
be fair and clear to the operators.
1:18:49
I think the down woody material was one of the things that was really key.
1:18:53
Young stand management certainly has been a focus for us, recognizing that
1:18:58
we have a lot of areas that were cut 40 to 50 years ago, and a number of stands
1:19:04
throughout the Western Cascades that are in the age class and size class where
1:19:10
they need to be commercially-thinned.
1:19:13
Well, what should we do today that will put them in a position we might
1:19:17
want them in 40 years from now, and how is that different from what
1:19:21
we were thinking ten years ago?
1:19:25
Do we want an even-aged, 80-year old stand out there with the biggest trees possible,
1:19:30
or do we want a stand that’s starting to develop multi-story characteristics.
1:19:35
So, the young stand thinning and diversity project has been geared toward that.
1:19:41
We’re also thinking about the very young stands, the stands under 20 years.
1:19:45
What should we be doing with
1:19:48
those?
1:19:49
Those have probably been some of the real key things.
1:19:52
I think the other
1:19:55
emphasis area we’ve had for John, is this notion about what’s the context
1:20:00
for the management activities we do.
1:20:02
So, from the standpoint of, I’m gonna go out and cut trees from 20 acres out
1:20:09
here, how do I know whether that’s a good thing to do or a bad thing to do.
1:20:15
We heard about this on one of our field trips.
1:20:17
We would go up in the Mona Creek drainage, one of the places we’d go to
1:20:24
show people where we left large, green tree retention, we left snags, and we
1:20:30
had down woody material on the ground.
1:20:32
We would also talk about the notion of landscapes, and
1:20:38
context we put the treatments in.
1:20:41
We were standing up there one day and talking about how at that point-in-time,
1:20:45
this particular area was on trajectory for what you would expect from a regulated
1:20:50
forest, because we were doing an 80-year rotation, and you thought, “Well, how
1:20:54
much of the area would have been treated by now?” It was pretty much right on
1:20:58
track [% clear-cut patches] . So, we’re standing up there talking about the idea
1:21:03
of minimizing fragmentation and what not, one person said, “So this area that we’re
1:21:09
looking at, is it a good landscape or a bad landscape?” That’s a pretty hard
1:21:14
question to answer, because it depends on
1:21:19
your management objective, what context are you looking at, and what scale.
1:21:24
So, we put a lot of focus into this notion of landscape planning and analysis, and
1:21:32
the use of historical disturbance regimes to perhaps see if they can give us some
1:21:39
guidance for how we might want to do management activities in the future.
1:21:45
We’re kind of at that stage now, being able to implement this Blue River
1:21:49
Landscape Management and Monitoring strategy, and hopefully learn about this
1:21:55
approach that will generate information we can use when we’re in the next generation
1:22:00
of large-scale planning, what can we learn from this that will help, and maybe
1:22:05
we ought to head kind of this direction.
1:22:07
Or validate that the Northwest Forest Plan is heading in a good direction, or isn’t.
1:22:14
You mentioned earlier some of these industry and environmental groups
1:22:17
that you took on tours to discuss some of the issues of the early ‘90s.
1:22:24
Are there some groups that you found particularly helpful or
1:22:30
important to have along?
1:22:32
That’s a really good question.
1:22:35
What I noticed was that there were more industry association groups willing to
1:22:40
come on tours and talk about things.
1:22:43
I believe part of that was they were trying to communicate to their membership,
1:22:48
perhaps trying to get their membership to have a better understanding of
1:22:52
what might be coming, for whatever purpose they might have had for that.
1:22:57
On the environmental end, it was actually relatively challenging sometimes to
1:23:01
get people to participate, because we were in this shift of the power.
1:23:06
The power was moving, and for some of the environmental community at that time when
1:23:12
we were operating under an injunction [Dwyer injunction on logging in federal
1:23:13
lands within the range of the northern spotted owl] and different settings,
1:23:15
it wasn’t necessarily in their interest to come along and figure out what are
1:23:19
good ways to manage the forest, because from their perspective, that wasn’t
1:23:25
necessarily what the end result goal was.
1:23:30
What I saw that was particularly valuable, especially those trips where we’d get
1:23:35
people with a mix of interests, and so that you would have people along the
1:23:40
scale of opinions, dialoging together, having that opportunity to question each
1:23:47
other and learn from the questioning.
1:23:49
So, I think that was probably the really key part.
1:23:54
Beyond that, I think some of the key roles were the opportunity for some of
1:23:59
the people in our political policy-making branches to take a chance to come out
1:24:07
and ask their questions and learn from what was going on, and to think about
1:24:12
what their positions might be on this as they went through that debate.
1:24:16
Was
1:24:19
there a recruitment strategy you could use when you were
1:24:23
trying to bring people up there?
1:24:25
Were you trying to balance these groups, in other words?
1:24:26
My sense was that we responded more to requests than that
1:24:31
we tried to generate them.
1:24:33
Okay.
1:24:34
As an example, the Western Forestry and Conservation Association did several
1:24:40
tours for a period of time on the district and on the experimental forest.
1:24:46
They would come to us and ask us to participate or to design something.
1:24:51
Probably the ones that we might generate were opportunities for
1:24:55
elected officials, if they wanted to come out when they were on break, or
1:25:01
we would respond to media requests.
1:25:05
It was probably not a concerted marketing effort on our part to get people out, but
1:25:10
more, these were people who wanted to be talking about this, they wanted a place to
1:25:15
come, and we responded in terms of trying to have an interconnected discussion.
1:25:21
Okay.
1:25:29
I wanted to ask you this question, because I asked Mike Kerrick this also.
1:25:34
How do you go about communicating your management needs to researchers?
1:25:39
What’s the point of contact, and how does that process
1:25:45
tend to flow in your experience?
1:25:45
I think there are a couple of different levels at which that happens.
1:25:52
One example is actually coming up fairly shortly at the regional level, between
1:25:58
the regional forester [Region] and the station director [PNW] . In the middle
1:26:02
of this month, the regional leadership team and the station leadership team
1:26:09
are spending a day together, thinking about where have they come from
1:26:13
and where do they want to go in the future, in terms of the connection
1:26:16
between research and management.
1:26:20
There are formal kinds of approaches where you identify a long-term need
1:26:26
and you can submit it up through channels and discussions go on.
1:26:29
Is it something to work on, or isn’t it?
1:26:33
There are formal processes.
1:26:36
My sense is
1:26:40
we use a lot of informal processes locally, and
1:26:43
communicate what our needs are.
1:26:45
The young stand one is a really good example.
1:26:49
That was something Mike [Kerrick] was really interested in, and our
1:26:51
previous Forest Silviculturist Bob Sanders, was really motivated about.
1:26:58
They kind of saw that coming and said, “We’re gonna need to do some work on
1:27:01
this.” So, we wound up starting a process that way, and it was really through the
1:27:08
LTER meetings, and working with Art and Fred [Swanson], that some of the questions
1:27:13
became, “Well, how do we design this, who needs to be involved, who needs to
1:27:16
participate, what will be the priorities of the study, who can be a lead scientist,
1:27:23
who will be the principle investigator?” I see, more at the local level, probably
1:27:29
more connection with those positions, the project leader and the site director.
1:27:38
We talk back-and-forth quite a bit about what we think is coming up.
1:27:44
There are some opportunities to build that in, either to the basic
1:27:47
program of work that they’re doing, or it becomes an opportunity.
1:27:51
Can
1:27:53
scientists access resources to expand what they’re doing?
1:27:59
What’s going on in larger scale things, such as at the regional network scale?
1:28:04
The long-term ecosystem productivity one is an example that was actually started
1:28:10
out as a nationwide kind of venture.
1:28:14
And it was initially a long-term site productivity venture, and there were
1:28:20
folks in California involved in that.
1:28:23
They added a slightly different focus than happened up here in the Northwest,
1:28:27
but you had folks up in Portland who were kind of making a real push on that.
1:28:33
I know that was kind of coming into the fray when I got here, because
1:28:40
one of the first things I was involved in was several meetings.
1:28:42
They had the station director and the regional forester signed off
1:28:46
that this is an important thing.
1:28:48
I was up at a meeting in Portland, at some point in time, I forget when.
1:28:53
John Butruille was still regional forester at the time.
1:28:57
We had an early morning meeting before that other meeting was
1:29:00
going to occur, for folks that were potentially involved in the long-term
1:29:04
ecosystem productivity thing.
1:29:05
And I remember talking about the need to have an agreement to set
1:29:09
these areas aside in our forest plans, as special management areas.
1:29:13
We needed to dedicate them to the purpose of those sites, or local
1:29:18
district rangers were going to be caught needing to produce timber out of there.
1:29:23
How would that work when we’re trying to have this 200-year study?
1:29:28
So, we had quite a bit of discussion about that.
1:29:30
And out of that did come a whole process for forest plan amendments
1:29:33
and such for those sites.
1:29:35
In that instance, you have a PNW employee who was set up as the site lead.
1:29:42
Then you have
1:29:46
a national forest systems person, Bob Meurisse, who’s a
1:29:49
soils person in the RO [Regional Office] , and he takes that lead.
1:29:53
But, it is kind of that classic example, because you have all the procedures,
1:29:58
you have all the agreements, you’ve got regional foresters and station
1:30:01
directors signing things, and yet, when it came time to fund it and put emphasis
1:30:06
on it, it sort of fell through the cracks because it didn’t have somebody
1:30:12
who was the project leader for it.
1:30:14
There wasn’t anybody in lobbying for the budget.
1:30:17
So, it was really an interesting one to me because it was the classic
1:30:21
example of, we’re saying we need to do these large-scale studies and
1:30:25
big adaptive management plans, and we need to make this all happen.
1:30:29
Yet, where we had so much commitment, we had the agreements and people
1:30:34
on the ground making it happen, it was a tremendous challenge
1:30:39
to keep it in the forefront.
1:30:42
This needs to occur, or doesn’t need to occur.
1:30:47
I don’t know if that answers your question.
1:30:49
That’s pretty good.
1:30:49
I’m curious if there’s any instances you
1:30:53
can recall where the presence of the Andrews and timing of long-term
1:30:59
research you’ve been talking about,
1:31:03
is a drag on your ability to accomplish things and convince people to support
1:31:09
what you’re trying to accomplish?
1:31:12
That’s an interesting question.
1:31:15
What my sense would be
1:31:20
is that to a large degree, people who are from outside of our area tend
1:31:25
to have a whole lot of thirst for knowledge about what we’re doing.
1:31:31
As you get closer to the Willamette National Forest, you
1:31:36
see adjustments to that happening.
1:31:39
It’s kind of like when you’re not in the eye of it, you can
1:31:42
see the value of it externally.
1:31:45
On the forest, on occasion, I’d say, it has actually created jealously on some
1:31:51
units, that we have had the opportunity to do things differently, or to work
1:31:56
with the scientists in a way that other people might not have gotten to.
1:32:01
We find that employees on other districts have more interest
1:32:05
in knowing what we’re doing.
1:32:09
Yet, when we get to the management level, it’s sometimes hard to
1:32:12
get people interested in it.
1:32:14
Sometimes it’s been a challenge to have people see the value of the program.
1:32:20
I see that somewhat depends on our ability to communicate the work in
1:32:25
a way that people can comprehend.
1:32:28
To a large degree, sometimes the message I hear back, is if it’s so valuable,
1:32:32
they should fund it on the regional level or they should fund it nationally.
1:32:36
Because to a large degree, it’s the forest that winds up funding what we do.
1:32:41
So, that’s sometimes a challenge.
1:32:47
In the ‘80s the way our people tended to get funded was based on
1:32:52
unit costs, and they would be rated on how much they could do and how
1:32:56
low they could keep their unit cost.
1:32:58
There was a time when the unit cost, say for silviculture activities,
1:33:02
was pretty high, because there was a lot of work going on in the Andrews,
1:33:05
and it cost more to do things there.
1:33:07
You’re doing it for a different reason, different purposes,
1:33:10
you’re monitoring more.
1:33:12
My understanding is that for some of the folks on the district, they
1:33:15
felt like they could never get a good rating compared to their
1:33:22
compatriots around the forest, because that always drove their costs up.
1:33:26
One of the ways that was resolved was that we actually created a
1:33:29
separate subunit for the H.J. Andrews.
1:33:32
We have a district budget and then we have the Andrews budget.
1:33:35
And the Andrews budget is just for those parts that the forest is
1:33:39
doing, not for the research things.
1:33:39
When was that set up
1:33:43
initially?
1:33:43
It was in the ‘80s at some point-in-time.
1:33:45
I don’t have an exact date.
1:33:46
And that’s a little bit of actual folklore.
1:33:50
I have never confirmed that this is why that really happened.
1:33:51
That’s
1:33:56
part about how much energy they have to really go back and find
1:33:59
out; is that really the history?
1:34:01
Or, did it get set up as a separate code because the region was sending money,
1:34:05
and it was always a separate code unit?
1:34:07
I don’t know the answer to that.
1:34:10
There have been times when there’s been a high level of intensity on the district
1:34:16
for us to produce a lot of work, whether that’s timber sales or other things.
1:34:22
When we have some support to the research activities that needs
1:34:26
to happen, it can kind of get overwhelming for some of the employees.
1:34:31
It can kind of feel like it’s an extra thing.
1:34:36
How can they get everything done?
1:34:38
But my sense is that most of our employees really feel that they get
1:34:44
to be a part of making a difference.
1:34:46
And that it’s only in those really high-stress periods where
1:34:49
it becomes kind of challenging.
1:34:52
Otherwise, it’s actually very stimulating.
1:34:55
We’ve just filled our fisheries biologist position and we are in
1:34:59
the process of selecting someone for our hydrologist position.
1:35:03
One of the things that we find with a lot of the jobs on both the Blue
1:35:07
River District and McKenzie District is the presence of the Andrews and
1:35:10
the opportunity to interact with scientists being a real draw for people
1:35:15
wanting to apply for these positions.
1:35:17
They see it as really a neat opportunity, particularly in those kinds of fields to
1:35:24
be on what they see as the cutting edge.
1:35:26
So, it helps us attract really good candidates for our jobs.
1:35:30
That’s an interesting point because a forest or district office can be a really
1:35:34
important element to the local community.
1:35:37
So, people you bring in there will have an impact on the local community environment.
1:35:39
Right.
1:35:41
Maybe along those lines, how would you characterize your understanding
1:35:45
of how the people of Blue River and the surrounding community there
1:35:50
understand what’s going on in the district, and in general in the Andrews?
1:35:56
I think it’s pretty mixed.
1:35:58
Then, the saw mill left, and the highway bypassed the town of Blue River
1:36:26
in the early ‘60s.
1:36:28
So, it’s been a struggling community in terms of finding its place.
1:36:37
There’s a mix of views, I think, of the agency and the experimental forest.
1:36:46
We’ve had a mix of reactions to the change in forest management and the paradigm.
1:36:51
I think one of the big issues for a number of local folks is access to firewood
1:36:55
and how that’s changed dramatically,
1:37:00
both due to the reduction in the amount of cutting we do, and then
1:37:02
also to the idea that we’re leaving material for other purposes, other than
1:37:07
bringing it into big unmerchantable piles that might go for firewood.
1:37:12
That’s probably one of the more challenging things we deal with,
1:37:15
especially about this time of year.
1:37:17
How do you handle that?
1:37:17
We have a
1:37:20
system we’ve come up with that doesn’t make anybody happy,
1:37:23
but it’s about what we can do.
1:37:25
People get on a waiting list and they’re allowed to get two cords
1:37:29
of wood, and we identify whether there’s available material.
1:37:34
We work our way down through the list.
1:37:38
We generally don’t have enough material we can identify that’s
1:37:42
easily accessible to meet the demand.
1:37:46
This last year, after the February of ‘96 flood, there was a lot of material
1:37:52
in Blue River Reservoir, and we wound up doing a partnership with some folks
1:37:56
from the [Army] Corps of Engineers.
1:37:58
We actually categorized all that material, and some of it, the really valuable wood
1:38:06
for peelers and stuff, went to the mill.
1:38:09
Other material that had root wads and such still attached, we identified
1:38:14
as trees that could be used for aquatic restoration projects, and
1:38:19
those got moved to another project.
1:38:22
And then, we had just a phenomenal amount of material that didn’t
1:38:25
fit either of those groups.
1:38:27
Working with the Corps, we kind of swept the reservoir because
1:38:33
of the operation of the dam, and then also, a safety matter with recreation.
1:38:37
We gathered that all up, the material was loaded into dump trucks, and we took
1:38:42
it over to an area called Stroup Flats.
1:38:45
So, we had these huge piles out around this area.
1:38:48
For the first time in a long time, we were able to meet everybody’s firewood demand.
1:38:55
It is a challenge, and people usually feel like the system isn’t fair.
1:39:01
They almost always feel that way anyways, because somebody gets easier to reach
1:39:05
material or better quality, but in this instance, where we can’t meet the level
1:39:09
of demand, it’s a very challenging thing.
1:39:12
For a lot of people who have lived in the valley a long time, and they
1:39:16
see some of these things as perhaps more restrictive than they’d like to
1:39:19
see, it doesn’t make sense to them.
1:39:22
How can you have money to go do this and that and the other, and you can
1:39:25
cut down trees to send to the mill or you can cut down trees to leave lay
1:39:29
there, and you can’t give me enough firewood to get me through the winter.
1:39:35
That’s a perspective that I think sometimes is challenging.
1:39:38
A lot of folks have a variety of perspectives just about the agency in
1:39:44
general, and about these paradigms.
1:39:47
And I would think that in the local community, they would pretty much mimic
1:39:51
what you see in society in general, all the way from folks who are geared
1:39:55
more towards having the forest being a natural system and not messing
1:40:02
with things, to people who don’t understand why we can’t continue on
1:40:06
the same trajectory we were on before.
1:40:10
Relative to the Andrews, you get kind an interesting mix as well.
1:40:14
There’s a lot of local folks who don’t know it’s there.
1:40:18
I don’t think we’ve tapped into it to the degree that we could.
1:40:22
I’ve heard of a wide range of things from “really neat place up there,”
1:40:27
all the way to, “I don’t want my kids near those wacko, weirdo scientists.”
1:40:34
It certainly has a wide range of perceptions out there.
1:40:40
I think that people who have the best sense of what’s going
1:40:43
on are probably people who know some of the folks who work there.
1:40:46
The people who live in the area and work there, and
1:40:52
what they’re communicating is kind of what perception people have about it.
1:40:57
I think it’s a bit of a hidden gem in terms of the valley.
1:41:02
There’s a lot of people who don’t realize the significant nature of what’s
1:41:08
kind of happening in their backyard.
1:41:09
How
1:41:17
many people there live locally, and how many people commute
1:41:20
in from the Springfield area?
1:41:21
That’s a good question as well.
1:41:24
My sense is that back at least into the middle ‘60s, most everybody who
1:41:29
worked on those two districts lived in the valley, in the general vicinity.
1:41:34
They’ve continuously been working on improving the highway, and
1:41:41
each improvement makes it much easier to commute to the town of Blue
1:41:45
River, or from Blue River to Eugene.
1:41:50
I’ve heard stories, and I don’t know if they’re accurate or not, but in the
1:41:52
early ‘60s, it would be an hour and half to two-hour drive into Eugene.
1:41:57
Now, depending on what traffic’s like and if they’re doing construction,
1:42:01
you can get there in 50 minutes.
1:42:04
It’s not an easy commute, but we do have a number of people who do it.
1:42:08
I couldn’t tell you exact numbers right now, but the proportions
1:42:13
seem to be fairly consistent.
1:42:15
My sense is, there’s about a third of the employees who live in the
1:42:22
Nimrod to McKenzie Bridge area.
1:42:25
Nimrod is at about milepost 34, and Blue River’s at milepost 40, and about a third
1:42:31
of our folks tend to live in that group.
1:42:34
And then from Nimrod down to Leaburg, which is around milepost 18, there’s
1:42:41
another third of our employees.
1:42:43
And then we have a third that live down in Springfield or Eugene.
1:42:46
It’s proportional.
1:42:48
Sometimes it’s a little higher down in the Springfield area.
1:42:52
Part of why some people are able to do that is the access to the bus.
1:42:59
You do have the Lane Transit District buses coming up twice in
1:43:02
the morning and twice in the evening.
1:43:05
Actually, you can get in a ten-hour day with the way the bus schedule
1:43:08
works for Blue River employees.
1:43:11
You can’t quite do it with the McKenzie, but there’s a bus that
1:43:14
will drop you off there, right about six, ten to six or a quarter to six.
1:43:19
And then there’s one that comes and picks people up at 4:10.
1:43:23
There’s another one that comes in at like 9:30, and then it comes back
1:43:26
through something like 7:15 at night.
1:43:29
And so, you can actually commute on the bus if you choose to.
1:43:43
Are there other people?
1:43:43
Go ahead.
1:43:43
One of the frustrations people in the up-river area have is that there’s not a
1:43:47
lot of employment in the up-river area.
1:43:51
So, you see a lot of people who live up the McKenzie commute into Eugene for work.
1:43:55
We kind of have the opposite, where people in the Eugene/Springfield
1:43:59
area are commuting up to our office.
1:44:05
When I first got to the district, we had about
1:44:09
72 permanent employees, and probably about that many seasonals.
1:44:14
Right now, we have right around 40 permanents, and this summer, we were
1:44:20
close to that on seasonals again.
1:44:23
Last year, not counting the young stand study crew, we
1:44:26
probably had ten to 15 seasonals.
1:44:28
You know, when we went into our serious decline, it went way down, but now
1:44:34
we’re fairly stable at right around 40.
1:44:38
And they’re routing from where?
1:44:39
They tend to come from a variety of areas.
1:44:41
We hire local folks, and then, people from different universities.
1:44:46
This summer we had people from Evergreen [College] , OSU, U of O, the University of
1:44:53
Montana and from Idaho, and then, we also had a number of local folks, people who’ve
1:45:00
grown up in the area who worked for us.
1:45:01
It was kind of an interesting mix.
1:45:05
Quite a mix, that’s good.
1:45:06
Should probably ask one more question and let you go here.
1:45:09
In earlier years, there was a logger who did most of the
1:45:14
treatments that they wanted to do on the Andrews, Mike Savelich.
1:45:17
I don’t know if you’ve heard of him?
1:45:19
No.
1:45:19
I was curious about now and between these studies, like the young stands or the
1:45:26
landscape studies, are there particular
1:45:31
groups that are more useful working with research that tend
1:45:34
to do better with the contracting?
1:45:36
How does that work?
1:45:37
That’s a good question.
1:45:39
The way our processes work is there is an open competition for a bid, and whoever
1:45:45
has the high bid, whoever’s going pay us the most money, will get the bid.
1:45:50
What we do try to do is make sure what is in the contract is really clear.
1:45:54
If something, like a research-related activity, and if it’s gonna have
1:45:59
particular restraints on what they can do, we put that in our prospectus
1:46:04
and throughout the contract.
1:46:09
We’ve had a variety of people then, who’ve had those contracts.
1:46:14
My sense is that you get a real mix in terms of who can deal with it the best.
1:46:19
Some people have challenges, but what we have found is that if the sale
1:46:24
administrator or the research folks associated with the project, take the
1:46:29
time to explain to the purchaser rep on the ground what’s going on, and
1:46:34
why we’re doing something, that we’ve had really good luck interacting with
1:46:39
people and having folks who would do their best to make the situation happen.
1:46:46
Part of that becomes a little bit of pride that gets built in the idea
1:46:50
that they’re helping do a study.
1:46:52
If
1:46:54
we don’t take that time, most of the time, it probably seems
1:46:57
pretty confusing to people.
1:46:59
Why do I have to do this?
1:47:01
There are some real hard questions sometimes to answer, like the long-term
1:47:05
ecosystem productivity, one of the treatments, we had them remove all
1:47:09
of the small pieces of material down to a certain size, all the down woody
1:47:14
material that would normally be left behind, they had to take off of the site.
1:47:18
Then we turned around and put down a mulch treatment.
1:47:20
So, for the operator, it’s sort of like it’s hard to get through their
1:47:25
head why that makes sense to do.
1:47:30
Sometimes it’s pretty challenging to explain.
1:47:33
But I think we’ve had really good luck with pretty much every operator.
1:47:38
Of course, you find different levels of interest because the
1:47:43
operators on the ground may not be the people who bought the sale.
1:47:47
They may either work for those people or they may be a subcontractor.
1:47:53
That was one of the things that we saw in 1991 on some of the tours, where we
1:47:58
were leaving down woody material, and trying to leave the green trees and snags.
1:48:03
The subcontractor out there doing the work was pretty clear that in
1:48:06
his mind that he could do just about anything that we wanted to achieve.
1:48:11
He really felt that he could.
1:48:13
However, he didn’t want to be the one who wound up absorbing the cost
1:48:16
[of more complicated and costly logging systems] for all society.
1:48:18
So, his production rates would be lower, or other things would happen,
1:48:22
and he wanted the system to change in some way where he wasn’t the one who
1:48:27
absorbed the costs of doing that, and that either the purchaser or agency
1:48:32
would absorb some of those costs.
1:48:36
There’s some people who probably are more efficient on the ground, and are
1:48:41
kind of sharper at figuring out how to do those things, and also doing
1:48:50
their negotiating with the people they’re going to work for, so
1:48:53
that they get a reasonable price for the work they’re doing.
1:48:57
It sounds like it might be hard to gauge, but I was wondering if
1:48:59
there’s a difference in people who are repeat bidders on the Andrews, as
1:49:05
opposed to elsewhere on the district.
1:49:08
Actually, we haven’t had much timber harvesting on the
1:49:10
Andrews since I’ve been here.
1:49:12
We’ve only sold very small sales.
1:49:18
The sale we’re getting ready to do soon with them will be a look at
1:49:22
some uneven-aged stand trajectories.
1:49:25
It will be the first sale of its size we’ve had on the Andrews,
1:49:29
since I’ve arrived in May of ‘89.
1:49:32
Yeah, I’d forgotten that.
1:49:34
It’s very difficult, actually, to compare because we did have the
1:49:39
[experimental canopy] gaps study that we implemented out there.
1:49:43
Talking to Tom Spies [who led the study] , he was very happy with
1:49:46
the work that those folks did;
1:49:49
that’s my recollection that he was happy with their work.
1:49:53
The young stand thinning and diversity study replications are actually
1:49:57
located on three different districts on the [Willamette National] forest.
1:50:00
None of them are in the Andrews.
1:50:02
The LTEP [Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity Study] site is on the Blue River
1:50:05
District, some distance from the Andrews.
1:50:09
That’s been one of the learning things, I think, for some of our
1:50:12
purchasers, is that a lot of what we offer for sale has some kind of
1:50:19
learning objective associated with it.
1:50:23
It’s not been clear to me if we see a lower bid price with our
1:50:28
sales versus others on the forest.
1:50:31
Sometimes I’ve wanted to look at a comparison, but there are
1:50:34
too many different things, often times to be able to really tell a
1:50:39
difference, and if so, what causes it.
1:50:41
We have pretty steep ground and some challenging things.
1:50:45
But, that’s one of the things that I do want to look at in the next few years,
1:50:51
because that would be one of the indicators that the price they bid for
1:50:55
our sales is lower than other districts because it costs them more to do the work.
1:51:01
I’d be curious how that works out, too.
1:51:03
But, I probably better let you get back there, it’s almost 2:30 now.
1:51:05
Thanks for
1:51:11
your
1:51:26
time.
1:51:42
I was talking
1:51:45
with Fred about this last week when we were down in the Sierras.
1:51:48
I think one of the real key things we did was to switch to the research
1:51:54
liaison position that John is in.
1:51:56
I think there’s a large volume of work that he’s been able to coordinate
1:52:01
that’s not so much on the basic research end, because that’s a whole different
1:52:06
arena, but on the application end of things and demonstrations, and getting
1:52:11
some administrative studies out there.
1:52:13
So, as you’re visiting with him and others, I think a thing to listen for is
1:52:24
how people feel about the amount of applied work that’s working off
1:52:30
of the experimental forest versus the work and the focus that’s on
1:52:35
the experimental forest itself.
1:52:37
Yeah.
1:52:38
You know that there’s really a transition there?
1:52:40
We’ve got a map I could show you sometime if you’re interested.
1:52:43
There’s the map that shows all the studies in the Andrews, but then
1:52:46
we’ve got one that shows where are all these demo sites and different study
1:52:51
areas that are not on the Andrews.
1:52:53
It’s a pretty impressive map.
1:52:55
Yeah, I’d be real interested in that.
1:52:55
It’d be, especially for the book, something like that.
1:52:55
Okay.
1:52:55
One of the ideas we’ve been exploring, is the work beginning with the focus on
1:52:55
the Andrews, and then, the movement off.
1:53:03
It would be kind of interesting if we can graphically show that on
1:53:08
just a local scale.
