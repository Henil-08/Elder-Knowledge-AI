00:00
Please talk a little bit about your background, your personal background.
00:00
With the dinosaurs or pre-Andrews stuff?
00:00
Start at the beginning [Laughter].
00:00
You mean where I grew up and that kind of stuff.
00:00
Any kind of detail you want; mainly where you’re from, your academic
00:00
training, and that kind of stuff.
00:00
I grew up in a little part of Maryland that turned into metropolitan D.C.
00:00
[District of Columbia] . I spent 20 years in Montgomery County, Maryland.
00:00
I lived on small dairy farm that now is probably a housing development, along with
00:00
all the other ones in the area, and then went to college for a couple of years.
00:00
I went to college for a year at the State University of New York,
00:00
and that’s not what I wanted to do, so I transferred over to Michigan
00:00
State, and got a B.S. in Forestry.
00:00
Couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do and was motivated by two things;
00:00
one was trying to see how forestry was practiced, and two was finding a job.
00:00
I went into a graduate program at Penn State and that led me to forest
00:00
planning and operations research.
00:00
Forest planning felt like that’s where I could make a good way
00:00
to quickly influence decisions.
00:00
But, naively I thought that forest planning leads to good development.
00:00
Perhaps it does in some sense, but does not always play a direct role.
00:00
Then I did operations research, because the Forest Service was
00:00
looking for modelers and analysts in research forestry projects.
00:03
I was in a graduate program with an advisor that resulted in degrees in
00:03
forest management and operations research.
00:03
When I got finished with that, I worked with the Allegheny National Forest in a
00:03
forest plan prototype managing project.
00:03
Then, I came out here because I always wanted to be in the Northwest.
00:03
That probably goes back to the pictures of the North Cascades in
00:03
National Geographic and big old forests in the Olympic Mountains.
00:03
Some pictures of hugely-productive, lush forests, and snow covered mountains;
00:03
that lured me to the Northwest.
00:03
I worked a couple summers in the mid ‘70’s in northern Idaho, and took
00:03
some trips into Washington and Oregon.
00:03
I knew that this was the region where I wanted to come.
00:03
I looked at the job listings for graduate-level people, and there happened
00:03
to be a job open for an operations research analyst to work on a forest
00:03
plan at the Richmond National Battlefield Park, I applied for it and got it.
00:03
I got out here in ‘81.
00:03
Worked a few years doing that with an expanding role of responsibilities,
00:03
then, a summer position on the Willamette [National Forest] opened up in ’85,
00:03
and I was hired around ‘86 to continue forest plan modeling and outdoor work.
00:03
I came over here on the provision that I get out on the district, so
00:03
I came out to the Willamette system and was modeling little stuff.
00:03
A person who left the agency, left the forest [Will NF] floundering for
00:03
a long time in the planning process, and soon after this lateral move in my
00:03
career occurred, I wanted to get out on the district and closer to the ground.
00:03
The Willamette people had a lot of opportunities, lots of things happening.
00:04
My end of the deal was to help the whole planning thing for a couple of
00:04
years and get me into a better position.
00:04
We did that and I got out on the Lowell District during the planning process.
00:05
It looked like it was heading towards a conclusion and lots of people
00:08
were interested in the results.
00:09
I headed up a team of people who were interested in the
00:14
forest-type research plan.
00:16
It allows flexibility and freedom to try different things.
00:22
I wound up working on the landscape analysis sale, implementing the plan, and
00:24
developing the kind of questions for the
00:28
first real contact with the Andrews regarding some of the stuff we were
00:31
doing, I think probably through Lynn
00:38
Burditt.
00:38
Lynn must have said something to Fred [Swanson] and Art [McKee] . Now, I can’t
00:40
remember how the connection was made.
00:44
Maybe, I was presenting this stuff we were working on.
00:47
We did
00:50
fairly original stuff with classifying and using a landscape point-of-view, taking
00:57
ecological functions of old growth forests and translating that into a landscape
01:03
scale, to help influence how managers choose when and where to cut or not to
01:09
cut, and identifying more significant blocks and how they are connected.
01:14
We were presenting that, Fred and Art became aware of that,
01:17
and they started talking to me.
01:20
We set up a meeting and identified additional scenarios we might try with
01:26
our team that were similar to some of the things they were interested in
01:32
looking at up at the Andrews, and we agreed it was cool to go ahead with
01:40
the landscape theme.
01:40
I started talking with Fred and Art and the project.
01:46
I think that was simultaneous when the Andrews folk, Fred,
01:53
Art, Lynn, and, who else?
01:55
Gordon [Grant] , I think, was pretty involved in the landscape projects.
02:00
We were realizing they really needed a whole new focus to work
02:07
through this body of work with
02:10
the science group on the Andrews.
02:12
We wanted to get our landscape focus, and I don’t know to what extent exactly their
02:19
advisement, but they ended up saying, “Hey we needed to do this.” So, they
02:23
set up the position that way and that’s how I got there. There’s the five-minute
02:29
version of how I got to the Andrews.
02:34
Do you recall
02:37
who your advisor was for your master’s degree?
02:40
Brian Turner.
02:43
He’s now at the Australian National University.
02:48
You
02:51
didn’t
02:53
have experiences of
02:56
this work before you
03:01
met at him at that time, particularly role models?
03:21
Not really.
03:27
Ralph Henderson comes up in the discussions somewhere.
03:29
Yeah.
03:30
He was our supervisor at one time when I was in the planning group in the
03:36
[Willamette National Forest] supervisor’s office in Eugene.
03:39
And I never thought of him as a mentor, but I got along with him
03:43
and still get along with him.
03:45
I was up there yesterday, BS-ing about Penn State.
03:49
He’s a Penn State graduate, too, and Fred is also,
03:53
BS-ing about that.
03:58
He’s
04:02
in a position of authority on the [Willamette] forest;
04:05
been around a long time.
04:06
Happened to be my supervisor.
04:07
So, I gained some insights on how the forest [Andrews] had developed.
04:13
Could you give me some examples of forest administration, their
04:18
ideas about forest plans, and the kind of work you’d been doing?
04:24
Also, how that evolved into some of your ideas on how they changed.
04:33
Well, it’s hard to say, because it’s been such a synthesis of so many things.
04:39
I don’t know how much you’re aware of the landscape stuff we’ve done the last
04:43
6-8 years, especially in the Augusta Creek and Blue River watersheds.
04:47
Fairly
04:50
unique, really unique in terms of what we have done.
04:53
It’s really sort of a synthesis of the various threads, and a
04:58
little bit of the planning and modeling background that I had.
05:02
Lots of the modeling around forest planning revolved around how timber
05:05
harvest was going to take place; how much, at what rate, spatial
05:09
patterns, that kind of thing.
05:11
Had the sort of timber harvest scheduling over time and spacing-kind of modeling
05:16
concept, and then applied that to more of an ecological point-of-view.
05:23
I think of it in terms of scheduling to meet the sustained flow of
05:27
timber harvest that meets sustained flow of ecosystem conditions, the
05:33
objectives for those conditions.
05:36
That’s where I started lengthening the natural-range-of-variability and
05:42
disturbance-regime kind of thinking.
05:45
Some of those threads, probably some of the strongest influence
05:47
there was Miles Hemstrom.
05:50
Has his name come up?
05:51
Yeah, yeah.
05:53
Miles was instrumental in that Lowell [Ranger District] project.
05:58
That forest planning implementation structure was actually called “The
06:03
Skunkworks.” Have you heard that term before?
06:04
No.
06:05
Pretty sure it came out the time of Tom Peter’s late ‘80’s
06:19
books on reinvention and the “New Age” economy [e.g., In Search of
06:23
Excellence] . What made things click for a successful corporation, the
06:27
“Skunkworks” idea was a notion that
06:31
may or may not be officially-sanctioned.
06:35
It is people who are coming together to do something creative.
06:39
Off-line.
06:40
It’s not a part of day-to-day production.
06:43
These people are working on something, give them resources and support
06:48
and let them do their own thing.
06:50
That’s the way the forest plan thing was set up, the implementation team,
06:54
which is why I was attracted to it.
06:56
That’s the kind of mode I’d like to operate in.
06:59
Give me some support, let me do my own thing.
07:00
And if you trust me, you could get it.
07:01
I feel real fortunate as
07:08
the whole plan of mine worked in the Forest Service.
07:10
I’ve generally had that kind of flexibility and
07:13
support, to be creative and
07:18
bring in the resources and
07:22
bring in different people.
07:22
That’s the way all these different projects I’ve been in really worked,
07:27
including the forest plan stuff that was structured, and the implementation of
07:32
Skunkworks, which was really structured.
07:33
And the way we worked here since I’ve been involved in the last eight
07:38
years, is very loose and unstructured.
07:41
So, that may have its own frustrations, but it allows a
07:45
lot of creativity to blossom.
07:49
Was there some increase in activities of that type as time goes by?
08:04
There’s a lot of lip service to it.
08:05
You kind of dipped into Forest Service bureaucracy and see how it works.
08:08
Yeah.
08:12
In the mid ‘80’s, it was a pilot project and pilot source, and there
08:16
was a lot of hoopla there, then there was Skunkworks and reinvention, and
08:21
the last few years, has been creating teams, and this effort to try and
08:22
keep up with the trends of the day.
08:22
But the reality I’ve seen in the bureaucracy in the last few years, is
08:35
to tighten, tighten, tighten [fiscally] . I still can’t figure out
08:38
the underlying thing driving that, if it’s people in charge at the department
08:44
[Department of Agriculture] levels, or way up above that just feel the need
08:46
to bring the bureaucracy into line.
08:49
But I can see it through purchasing, contracting, computer rules, and our
08:55
agreements, how we move money around.
08:57
All those kinds of things kept getting tighter and tighter in the last few years.
09:01
So, I don’t know if I would say there’s been more recognition of the importance
09:07
of that, but the actual reality is that the bureaucracy hasn’t been there.
09:14
I was just curious to know
09:18
if this isn’t somewhat unique?
09:24
Yeah, I’m not a very good indicator of the Forest Service or even
09:29
the Willamette or even Blue River [Ranger District] for that matter.
09:31
My position is really unique.
09:32
Sort of peerless actually.
09:36
I don’t have a group of peers to relate to.
09:39
There aren’t people in this region, maybe nationally, that
09:45
have a similar job to mine.
09:48
Were you aware of that when you took the job?
09:53
Yeah, someone stationed on a
09:58
ranger district that has a responsibility for coordination, implementation, or
10:05
research, monitoring and education.
10:07
In fact, Lynn told me when I first started, that one of the expectations
10:12
was that it might take a while to get there, but that I‘d develop a
10:20
research-type program of my own interests.
10:23
That’s what I’m working towards and kind of getting there now.
10:28
Most people working on districts have a target.
10:32
You’re supposed to do this amount of trails or timber sale preparation,
10:36
or wildlife projects or whatever.
10:37
It’s a project-specific focus on a year-to-year kind of production mode.
10:44
So does that kind of research includes that kind of support?
10:50
I’m expected to go find the budget myself for the most part.
10:54
There was support in terms of forest processes, things like
10:58
the Blue River [Landscape Plan] project I’m trying to develop and
11:00
get approved as an administrative study at the regional level.
11:04
It has to be according to manuals and procedures.
11:07
The regional forester has to approve it, and when that happens, it’s going
11:11
give me greater access to some funding.
11:15
So, I’ve been gluing together various funds to support
11:20
various projects over the years.
11:22
And the philanthropy front has been building and building.
11:24
I think I’m in a good position now to develop a sustained program.
11:30
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your first positions, what
11:35
you saw as your priorities, and as the others saw it as an officer.
11:40
Well, hardly anybody has used the officer part of it.
11:44
Fred calls me a research liaison.
11:47
I think my research position is called a “research coordinator.”
11:51
I think that might have some implications in the PNW terminology
11:56
somewhere, so Fred prefers liaison.
11:58
I just try to avoid specific titles.
12:02
I’m classified as an “ecologist” in the position description lingo.
12:09
I’ve got graduate degrees in forestry and operations research.
12:12
I
12:15
never did standard work in ecology [in academics] . So, forestry, ecology, and
12:19
modeling, are my academic backgrounds.
12:23
When you moved into this position, which was, as you described, a lateral
12:29
move for you, what were your first impressions of the needs at the district?
12:37
At that time, things were kind of broke because our predecessor had
12:43
been gone for a few months at an extremely chaotic time for the district.
12:48
I don't know if you remember the Section 318 legislation [part of
12:53
a Congressional appropriations bill.] Do you know about that?
12:54
Vaguely.
12:57
There had been an injunction on timber sales in Region 6 in early ‘89.
13:04
So, legislation was passed that lifted the injunction and provided that the national
13:11
forests and BLM in western Oregon and Washington sell about 10 million board
13:15
feet in about a year-and-a-half period.
13:21
Language [appropriations bill [to which Section 318 was attached]
13:21
to fund the agencies] was there as to how that was to be done.
13:23
An advisory board was established, the logging was supposed to minimize
13:26
fragmentation [old-growth forest habitat] , and ecological systems of old-growth were
13:36
to be maintained.
13:37
People were really pushed.
13:38
That’s a lot of timber sales, a lot of preparation that had to be
13:41
done through the advisory board.
13:43
So, I was in the midst of that, the predecessor had gone, and there was a
13:47
surge of research proposals were sitting there that people may or may not review,
13:52
which sort of dispersed out responsibility to profs and different people, and most
13:57
of them were being ignored, waiting for them to pick them up and get them going.
14:01
My first task was to pick up projects, one-by-one, getting them moving again.
14:06
We built a flume.
14:09
You’ve seen the flume out there [U.S. Geological Survey debris flow flume at
14:11
Andrews Forest] . That was one of the very first projects that I worked on.
14:13
I also got the “Gap Study” and Charlie Halpern’s successional study [Starbright]
14:20
, and a mycorrhizal study. There was a whole bunch of them, including Stan Gregory’s
14:26
stream nutrient addition, dripping nitrogen directly into Lookout Creek.
14:32
Sort of an interesting experience for most of us, because it
14:34
generated public concerns.
14:35
It was probably the first time any serious concerns had been expressed
14:38
about what was going on the Andrews.
14:40
I could talk more.
14:43
Yeah, I’d like if you could elaborate on that one.
14:45
Well, the purpose of the project was really basic science.
14:50
It was an effort to understand the trophic response to elevated productivity.
14:55
Add more nitrogen, the algal communities and productivity are
14:58
going to flourish, invertebrates are
15:02
going to feed on that and benefit, so productivity is going to go up, and
15:07
then the fish feed on the invertebrates.
15:10
That’s where the trophic levels enter the deal.
15:12
What they were trying to do is to see how tightly these levels were linked.
15:17
How quickly would an increase in production at the primary level translate
15:23
all the way up through the levels?
15:25
Would there, actually, be a whole lot more algae in the streams, or would
15:28
you not see any difference in the algae and there’d be bigger insects?
15:31
Maybe you wouldn’t see that, you’d see more and bigger fish.
15:36
Everyone is trying to see that.
15:37
People, at least a handful of people, became alarmed,
15:44
because we were dripping known pollutants into the city of Eugene’s drinking water.
15:50
There was
15:58
concern that with elevated nitrogen you’re going to potentially create
16:06
an algal bloom in Blue River Reservoir and in lower Lookout Creek.
16:10
So, we went through all these calculations about the worst-case scenario with EWEB
16:13
[Eugene Water and Electric Board] . We eventually did the project and there
16:18
weren’t any negative effects whatsoever.
16:22
But there was a lesson for a lot of the folks involved in the Andrews programs,
16:27
that not everyone perceives people doing research as always wearing a white hat.
16:32
Was there an organized group setting the opposition?
16:35
There were individuals that participated in groups, but it
16:40
never got beyond individuals.
16:41
I don't even think that the potential environmental stuff was appealed.
16:46
I don't think it was appealable from what I can remember correctly.
16:49
I think they sort got worn out with this and gave up, figured we were going
16:55
to do it anyway, and we really had pretty good answers to their questions.
16:59
I don’t think it meant they liked the project, but they just sort of went away.
17:03
“We” as the [ranger] district?
17:06
We,
17:09
for me, is the Cascade/Andrews Center Team.
17:13
I’m an employee of the Willamette National Forest, but one thing my
17:15
position says is I report to a board of directors: one from PNW, one
17:23
from OSU, one from the Willamette.
17:25
I get my work direction priorities from a quarterly meeting I
17:29
have with Fred, Lynn, and Art.
17:32
So, formally I am an employee of the Willamette National Forest, but I
17:36
really feel like I am an employee of the Andrews Cascade Center [Cascade
17:40
Center for Ecosystem Management].
17:40
I work very closely with Fred and Art as well as Lynn, to make sure
17:45
of our collective priorities.
17:50
The fielding of public concerns in that case, were people coming
17:53
to you individually or was there kind of a group of people involved?
17:59
It was basically
18:02
Stan Gregory and his team, Linda [Ashkenas] especially, and folks from
18:07
the district, that were responsible.
18:09
The district has responsibility for any project that might affect the environment.
18:17
That’s a formal responsibility that Lynn, as line officer, has.
18:24
So, we were collectively doing field trips and public meetings.
18:28
We, the
18:31
Willamette National Forest, wouldn’t do it independently of Stan and Linda.
18:37
The only reason the national forest was evaluating the project, was
18:40
because Stan and Linda wanted to do it.
18:44
Stan had a grant from NSF to get it done.
18:44
So, you
18:47
took people up onto Lookout Creek, to show them where it was being done?
18:52
Yes, before it was done, about where we were gonna do it.
18:56
We did have a couple of follow-up meetings; it was a three-year project.
18:59
So, the first year, here’s the result.
19:00
We took them down, showed where the site was, that it was dripping
19:05
[chuckle] nitrogen into the stream.
19:11
Were there large groups coming up there
19:16
or it was just a few people?
19:16
Three to five people.
19:18
Were they representatives of
19:21
-- ? -- There were two local citizens.
19:25
One, who was at the time on the ONRC [Oregon Natural Resources
19:30
Council] Board of Directors.
19:32
Another local citizen had been involved with the forest [Willamette] for a
19:36
long time, had helped start a group called the McKenzie Guardians, which
19:41
really is no longer an active group.
19:43
In fact, he kind of dropped out of the scene as well.
19:46
And then, a third person,
19:50
who had worked
19:53
in the [Forest Service] Washington office in hydrology.
19:56
He may have even been a national director [or assistant director]
20:00
pretty high up in the Forest Service, but he retired in Eugene.
20:04
And he didn’t support the project.
20:08
It didn’t matter what we said.
20:09
He wasn’t going to change his perspective on that.
20:11
But then, there were a couple people from EWEB that were
20:16
really supportive of the project.
20:17
It was kind of an interesting political situation,
20:24
because they’re the guardians of the water through EWEB.
20:28
They were telling us face-to-face when we talked with them, that
20:34
they were supportive and thought we’d generate good information.
20:37
They’d come out, and they would answer questions that
20:40
the public folks might have.
20:42
There could have been a couple other people involved in this stuff, but
20:49
we don't really think it would have an effect on the water.
20:51
In the worst-case scenario, it’s barely measurable.
20:57
By the time it gets to intake facilities, it’s going to hardly be detectable.
20:59
It’s not going to cost us any money or any problems to deal with this.
21:03
But they would never give us any money or give us a letter or say anything
21:06
formally, like we support this project.
21:09
So, they were guardians of the water quality in the McKenzie.
21:15
They were protecting their own political rear-ends on how we would interpret it.
21:20
The always participated and were generally supportive.
21:25
That strategy, from your perspective, was to bring people out and show them what was
21:29
going to be done, and give an opportunity
21:35
to show them respect and to hear their feelings?
21:35
We went beyond that, because we did a lot of work to address their concerns, either
21:40
in terms of analysis ahead of time to show them what the worst-case scenarios could
21:46
be, what was the relative magnitude, and we went to additional expense to establish
21:53
additional monitoring sites and to monitor additional variables, to provide them a
21:59
higher level of comfort, that we weren’t affecting the reservoir or the watershed.
22:05
We did beef up the monitoring a little bit with more factors beyond what
22:10
were integral to the study itself, in response to those comments.
22:16
I think that did help sway some of their concerns.
22:22
So, they did in some respect make the project better by
22:24
having that level of involvement.
22:26
I think the key thing for a lot of us up here, was that it was just
22:31
a little bit of a wake-up call.
22:34
Just because we’re doing research, we can’t just ignore NEPA, the Endangered
22:41
Species Act, or public concerns.
22:44
What you were saying is that kind of issue reached the public?
22:50
Yeah.
22:51
Well, there really hasn’t been a lot of activity [logging] on the
22:54
Andrews since the early ‘70’s.
22:58
Since I’ve been here in the last eight years, I think
23:01
we’ve cut about ¾ of an acre.
23:06
Not very much harvest activity, and this is the other significant
23:10
project in the last eight years.
23:13
Would you say there is much awareness in the local communities around
23:23
here in the issues of the Andrews?
23:24
I’d say anybody that’s been there any length of time is
23:26
dimly aware that it exists.
23:28
People that are a little more aware and pay attention to what goes on in
23:32
terms of forest management activities, would certainly be aware it exists.
23:36
The number of people that have any sense of its scale or scope or relevance to
23:42
forests or the region, is very small.
23:46
Lynn
23:48
Burditt was saying there was a study in ‘94 that studied the entire
23:54
[McKenzie] Valley population, I was curious of what your perception is
24:01
of your interactions between district staff and people in that region?
24:08
I live in Eugene.
24:13
Again, I work in multiple bases.
24:18
I go up more in the summer field season, and I spend 3, 4 days in
24:23
the Blue River, the Andrews area.
24:25
Up here in
24:28
the summer time, 2, 3 times a month.
24:31
The rest of the time I’m in Eugene or I’m off giving
24:34
presentations or somewhere else.
24:37
In the winter time, I’d flip-flop, so I spend more time up here and
24:40
less time in Blue River, in this facility, because this is where all the
24:44
science people are who work up here.
24:48
Maybe you could talk a little about your perception of the role and
24:54
purpose of the experimental forest at the time you started working there.
24:57
Had you had much experience prior to working at the Andrews
25:01
with experimental forests?
25:02
No, not at all.
25:04
I was certainly aware of the Andrew’s existence and its general role.
25:09
I didn’t really have a good sense of scope, breadth, depth of the
25:13
Andrews program, even though I’d been on the Willamette National
25:16
Forest for three years prior to that.
25:19
I sort of generally knew, but not really.
25:28
What was the question again?
25:29
At the time you started working there,
25:32
how did you perceive the purpose of the experimental forest?
25:40
I can’t really remember.
25:43
It’s hard for me to put that in context eight years ago, but I probably didn’t
25:47
have a whole lot of preconceived ideas, to tell you the truth.
25:49
The Andrews is
25:53
so different from other experimental forests in terms of the breadth
25:57
and scope of the program, and the interaction with a broad segment
26:01
of managers and policy-makers.
26:05
It’s certainly unmatched in the region, as far as I can tell;
26:09
it’s unmatched in the West.
26:12
So, I just didn’t have any sense of that, of the breadth and
26:15
scope of that, before I came.
26:20
I’m struggling because I don’t remember having any real strong emotions about
26:26
the role of the experimental forest.
26:28
One of the things that was kind of interesting, was the way the
26:33
job got going when I got there.
26:35
The way the initial position description was put together, was that I was going
26:38
to do the lead the Blue River Landscape Project, which is what I’m doing now.
26:43
Eight years ago, right after this, I was selected for the position, and there
26:50
was a spotted owl habitat conservation plan that came out with interim
26:54
directions, that said the Blue River watershed was going to be in a Habitat
26:58
Conservation Area where no manipulative activities were going to occur.
27:01
So, as soon as I got the position, I was supposed to develop this landscape
27:04
project which would involve timber harvest, but there was not going to
27:08
be any timber harvest in the area.
27:09
So, I had to basically start from scratch in terms of building a program.
27:12
I remember the forest supervisor telling me, it was in the first couple of weeks
27:17
after I got the job, in a laughing kind of way, “Well the good thing is you have
27:21
this job – now what you going to do? Is there going to be any work load for you?”
27:29
In retrospect, that was just a laughable kind of question, but,
27:33
basically, I had to create a program.
27:35
The Cascade Center was something we created that first year.
27:40
So, I looked around and said, “Well, okay, here’s this regional network of
27:44
sites called the Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity [LTEP] , they’re looking for
27:47
sites, and it seems to me that we have the Andrews here and we have this hub. We
27:50
ought to have a site.” So, I went out and found a site and got the research team.
27:54
This is related to the Andrews program but it’s really another research program.
28:00
It gets confused because it’s called the “LTEP,” which is awfully similar
28:04
to “LTER.” But about these LTEP sites, I said, “That looks like a program of
28:10
research that’s gonna have some stability and funding for a while.” That’s what
28:14
I was looking for initially after my project just disappeared from under my
28:19
feet, so let’s get something together.
28:22
So, we got this LTEP site.
28:23
We said, “Let’s start a “young stand thinning and diversity” project,” because
28:26
the forest seemed really interested in supporting that, and there were
28:29
other people involved from up here.
28:31
So, we built that project up.
28:34
You know, once again, it was a major study that had a fair
28:37
amount of funding coming to it.
28:38
Support for the research program in the Andrews, had some projects which were
28:43
on track by then, so we said, “Well,
28:47
let’s see what we can do with this landscape project, maybe not in
28:50
Blue River, because we got this habitat conservation area there.”
28:53
So, we looked at Augusta Creek, which you may have heard of before.
28:58
Augusta Creek was a place where we said, “Well, let’s start trying to develop
29:01
some new concepts at Augusta Creek.”
29:04
At the same time, the Forest Service had nationally initiated a program
29:09
called “New Perspectives.” I don’t know if you heard that before or not.
29:13
It was a very short-lived program and one of those continuing buzzword
29:17
evolutions, but it was one of the Forest Service’s initiatives to reform itself.
29:20
Somewhere along the way, I think it was the Ouachita National
29:20
Forest, the Chief [Forest Service]
29:31
went down there with Senator [Dale] Bumpers, or some senator from
29:35
Arkansas that had some seniority, and they talked about how we
29:40
should manage that national forest.
29:41
They came back and designated it a demonstration forest.
29:45
When I saw that I started thinking, “Well, you know, we’ve got the Andrews
29:49
and all this stuff going on here.
29:52
Then we’ve got these other research projects scattered all over the
29:54
place, then we have got the LTEP, the young stand thinning and diversity
29:58
study, and we’ve got Augusta Creek.
30:01
The whole district is involved in significant ways in terms of developing
30:05
and applying ecosystems information.
30:09
Maybe we are a “Demonstration District,” or “Blue River
30:12
Demonstration District.” I remember
30:19
we were coming back from a field trip in Augusta Creek; myself and Fred
30:23
and Art and Stan, and maybe Gordon.
30:29
We were talking about some of this stuff, where we should be going.
30:32
This idea of “demonstration district” sort of hit people, and we said “Well,
30:37
that sounds kind of cool.” There might be some handle to that we can grab.
30:42
So, we went back and I remember we started talking about it to Lynn,
30:46
who said, “You know that’s kind of interesting, lots of implications
30:49
there.” That afternoon I happened to be going to the FSL [Forestry Sciences
30:52
Lab - Corvallis] and I went into Rolf’s [Anderson] office [he was still in there],
30:56
and described this to him.
31:00
He said, “Well, that’s sort of interesting.” Mike Kerrick walked
31:02
into his office; he was the forest supervisor at the time.
31:05
I got up and went to the map, gave the same kind of promo and pitched it to Mike,
31:13
and he felt that was really cool, too.
31:15
So, I started writing it up.
31:17
Fred and I together were working on this description of the demonstration district.
31:22
Then I hit a snag.
31:23
Somebody said, “demonstration district,” that sounds like, “You’re gonna maybe
31:29
not cut as much timber or something.
31:33
It doesn’t seem like a good idea.”
31:38
The connotation of “demonstration district” was too much for
31:41
somebody along the way.
31:42
I can’t remember who it was or what happened, but
31:46
the Forest Service was setting up this New Perspectives program at that time.
31:51
They established a coordinator in both the regional office [Region] and [Pacific
31:54
Northwest Research] station level in Portland, and they came out for a visit.
31:59
They recognized our history as a place that was innovating
32:04
and developing new practices.
32:05
So, we laid out this same kind of thing for them and what we were thinking
32:09
about a “demonstration district.” At that stage they were trying to figure
32:13
out what structure the region should have for this New Perspectives program,
32:18
and we said, “This is kind of what we were thinking, but maybe of a different
32:23
title than demonstration district.”
32:25
We must have spent hours filling out different kinds of names and titles,
32:29
and finally we hit upon Cascades Center.
32:33
The “Center” label came from Steve McDonald, the PNW New
32:38
Perspectives manager there.
32:40
He was a fairly quiet kind of guy, but he said, “Well, I think that’s
32:45
got potential.” At that time, the Blue Mountains Natural Resource Institute
32:54
in northeastern Oregon and the Olympic [Natural Resources] Center up in
32:56
Washington were developing, and it was obvious that they were going to be
33:02
major players on the scene. The “Olympic Center” was sort of Jerry Franklin’s
33:08
brain child. I think Steve saw the “Cascade Center” somehow as giving us
33:17
panache, and we could compete in the marketing of the funding realm
33:21
with the some of the other centers.
33:23
In retrospect, it was an unfortunate choice of words, because “center” to most
33:26
people, implies a particular building or place. The Cascade Center really developed
33:33
into a program of activities, a program of work. It’s not really a place, as we
33:38
have activities spread all over the place.
33:40
The Andrews is one place.
33:43
There’s a boundary on a map, there’s a set of buildings.
33:45
That’s
33:48
how we got to Cascade Center.
33:53
We were looking for a better handle to describe our full sweep of research
33:58
management studies; case studies, demonstration areas, education
34:02
programs, than the Andrews program.
34:06
The Andrews program is really that research component
34:10
focused on this specific spot.
34:12
We had stuff spread out all over the forest that were much
34:14
broader programmatically than just the research program.
34:19
I think that’s where we came around to realizing that we ought to be
34:23
talking about and thinking about our whole scope of activities in that
34:26
broader context, and thinking about it as an adaptive management program.
34:31
And that’s the way we’ve been trying to describe our full suite of activities
34:38
[Cascade Center] since ‘91.
34:39
Was there in any input into that planning, from say industry, to try
34:44
and assuage these concerns about cutting or eliminating the funding?
34:50
Not really.
34:52
Well, do you mean that one about the demonstration district?
34:55
Yeah, that you were talking about, because it [resonated] at
34:58
least to the supervisor level.
34:59
Mike [Kerrick] sounded sympathetic, at least.
35:04
He was still wanting us to do it.
35:07
There was just a little blip.
35:08
That really doesn’t deserve a whole lot.
35:10
We just continued on with what we wanted to do and stopped calling
35:14
it a demonstration district, and started calling it the Cascade Center.
35:17
So really it didn’t effect anything we wanted to do.
35:21
That was just sort of a little blip there.
35:25
Industry really wasn’t involved directly in how we set things up.
35:31
In general, there wasn’t really any major concern about designating this as an
35:36
adaptive management district or program?
35:40
No, I don’t think so.
35:43
I think people saw the forest was still thriving on a pretty healthy budget.
35:51
If we were trying to start that now, that be a different story.
35:54
Unfortunately, it’s a much different place now.
35:59
People were generally pretty supportive.
36:01
There were some folks on the forest that would say, “You know, you guys are just
36:04
going to be competing for funding down the line,” but that was a pretty small
36:15
minority.
36:15
I wanted to get your perception when you started out in the position.
36:19
From what you said earlier, it sounded like the reputation and
36:24
accomplishments of people at the Andrews, hadn’t really hit home that much.
36:27
You had some contact, through Lynn, with Fred and Art, but in terms of
36:32
what had been happening at the Andrews, it wasn’t having much impact on you?
36:39
I just sort of took at as a given.
36:42
I’d been to symposiums and listened to Jerry or Tom Spies or Fred
36:48
or Stan, or somebody else talk.
36:50
Those were the kind of people you’d see.
36:52
Back in the ‘80’s, there was a lot of focus on old-growth-wildlife-habitat
36:56
relationships, and spotted owls.
36:58
Those were the things that were talked about a lot.
37:02
I just probably didn’t think about it a lot.
37:05
I certainly wasn’t driven to or attracted to the Andrews because of
37:11
the personalities or individuals.
37:16
Can you recall your first impressions of the Andrews or the people that work there,
37:21
when you began working for the district, and the relationship of district personnel
37:25
with the scientists at the Andrews?
37:26
At that time, the headquarters site was just a collection of old trailers.
37:32
So, one of the first visual images you get is, well, for a place that thinks
37:38
it’s really doing a lot of really great work, it sure looks like a dump.
37:42
Because it did.
37:45
That took me back when I first got there, was somebody showing me where
37:50
my office would be if I wanted to have an office up there, and in back of this
37:54
old tick- and mouse-ridden trailer.
37:56
It seemed just kind of odd.
38:00
So, the facilities have totally changed in the last eight years – for the better.
38:09
One of
38:12
the impressions that probably anybody would get [at least I certainly got]
38:16
was that, to the degree that things were organized, it’s not real apparent.
38:22
There’s a lot of
38:26
chaos.
38:27
It’s not as chaotic as it first appears.
38:32
But it’s a very different mode of operation than standard
38:37
National Forest operations are.
38:43
Much less focus on priorities.
38:45
People have a lot more freedom to split out and do their own things.
38:52
The assumption is by supporting this broad sweep of projects and programs,
39:00
and trying to have good relationships and information sharing, that good things are
39:05
going to result in a collaborative way.
39:07
I think to a significant extent that’s true.
39:11
The converse of that is there’s also a lot of wasted energy and
39:16
relatively unfocused efforts that may not ever result in anything.
39:20
So, that is kind of a converse side of the way things are orchestrated here.
39:25
When you first come on the scene, you see these isolated pieces of activity.
39:31
After a while, you get a bigger picture and you see how there is a
39:36
little bit of a method to the madness.
39:38
But that is, I still perceive as the way, our basic style of operating, so
39:42
at our monthly meetings, we exchange some information and work on our
39:45
relationships by BS-ing afterwards.
39:49
That’s kind of what we’re doing.
39:50
But we rarely say, “Okay, here’s a pressing need and here’s some options
39:58
and let’s sort through and find the best options, and this looks like the
40:02
best option, so you go do it. And then we’re gonna have something produced
40:06
by this amount of time, and here’s the product.” Which might be more the
40:09
way a National Forest might operate. That’s not the way we operate here.
40:16
I’m curious about your position title, “Research Liaison.” When for
40:24
you first started working at the district, was that more of an issue
40:26
of opportunities as opposed to a problem of people not communicating?
40:30
Well there was some of that.
40:37
One of the attitudes I ran into quite a bit at the district, was we have
40:41
our program of work, we have our priorities, we have our targets, and
40:47
we’ll try to do some of this research stuff for them, when we can fit it in.
40:56
We ran into some problems with that right away, because Lynn
40:59
even had some of that attitude.
41:01
For
41:04
the flume project and Charlie Halpern’s project, she was saying, “Well,
41:10
let’s work on that, as long as it doesn’t conflict with anything, and
41:16
we’ll see if we can make it happen.” It didn’t take us to long to figure
41:20
out we can’t operate that way.
41:22
We can’t be telling somebody, “Yes, we’re going to support this project,” and then
41:25
string them along for six months, then don’t find the time and don’t get it done.
41:28
Meanwhile they’ve gone out, got a grant, hired somebody, and collected
41:31
some data, and then we don’t do it?
41:33
We have to decide up front if are going to be committed, and then we’ve got to
41:36
do it all the way through, as if it’s one of our targets like everything else.
41:41
We started focusing on it’s not them or us trying to do their work from a
41:46
National Forest point-of-view, but that this, the Andrews, the Cascade Center
41:51
program, is one of the district’s primary programs and objectives.
41:56
It is an integral part of our collective body at work.
42:01
Lynn was very supportive of that, and worked on trying
42:03
to establish that mentality.
42:06
I don’t think we’ll ever be a hundred percent successful at that, but we’ve been
42:13
pretty successful.
42:14
As a matter of fact, it’s the first time I‘ve thought about it in a few years.
42:17
By and large, I think people do see that what we’re doing is integral
42:21
to the district’s program of work.
42:23
Part of it is something as simple as, you call up the Blue River [Ranger
42:27
District] trying to talk to somebody, but they answer “Blue River Cascade
42:30
Center.” That’s just a small change we made to make it more visible
42:37
as an integral part of our work.
42:41
When you talk about the
42:45
organization of the Andrews Group and implementing their decisions and
42:49
also providing other models for the National Forest system, would you say
42:53
your role is to keep those two kind of parallel to the Blue River District?
42:58
In other words, to make sure that what’s happening at the LTER
43:02
meetings feeds into the decision process at the district level?
43:05
Yeah, exactly.
43:06
That’s one of my roles, and why I’m so schizophrenic, because I have to operate
43:10
in both cultures and make the connections.
43:12
There’s lots of folks up here
43:18
that tend to see me as a down-to-earth, pragmatic, get-it-done kind of
43:22
person, because that’s the role I have play a lot of times.
43:25
If it’s something directly related to the landscape stuff or with just
43:29
trying to support other projects, that’s the kind of role I had to play.
43:33
The district, lots of times, sees me as this airy research person coming
43:38
in with ideas and concepts, not real connected with how you get stuff done.
43:44
That’s the role I try to play; bring both sides closer together
43:49
with what’s reality here.
43:50
Yeah, that’s pretty tough.
43:53
You mentioned the position was kind of open for a while, you’re predecessor.
43:57
Was it the same the role that person was playing?
44:02
Well somewhat.
44:03
I don’t really know for sure.
44:05
He was a silviculturist, and fairly focused on silviculture on the Andrews.
44:15
You know, he was not quite as focused on maybe the broader program,
44:20
but, Lynn or Fred can give you a better perspective than I could.
44:25
Uh
44:26
- Or Art.
44:30
I’ve actually talked to Lynn about it.
44:33
I haven’t talked to Art, and I should probably see him.
44:37
One of other questions I was curious about, as a forest manager when you
44:42
first started working there, how would you characterize your perception of the
44:45
conditions of the Andrews Forest, in terms of the way it had been managed up until
44:50
that point, and potential areas of concern as it related to the rest of the district?
44:59
You’re not talking about the people at the facilities, but the actual ecosystems?
45:01
Yeah, right.
45:06
Well,
45:09
it looked like it had suffered abuses in the fifties,
45:16
but it had been managed with a pretty light touch for the last 20 years,
45:22
and compared to many places on the Willamette National Forest, it had a
45:29
relative wealth of old-growth forest.
45:30
It had some nice old-growth
45:40
forest.
45:43
The Andrews as a place is a nice place, but there’s an awful lot of nice
45:50
places in the western Oregon Cascades.
45:53
I don’t really see it as all that uniquely of a distinctive place.
45:59
It’s what’s been done there that
46:04
makes it distinctive.
46:04
I don’t know if that’s
46:07
what you’re asking.
46:07
Yeah, that’s good.
46:07
I was curious coming in there as a forest manager if you found any problems
46:12
that needed to be addressed or to be managed in comparison to other places you
46:18
managed on before at Willamette Forest?
46:20
No, it was a little disconcerting that there weren’t clear objectives
46:27
for the management of the place.
46:30
But I’ve gotten used to that and it fits with the overall style pretty well
46:38
– multiple things hopefully building together and interacting without much
46:44
top-down kind of structure to it.
46:49
From a National Forest Service point-of-view, people would ordinarily
46:52
think, “Well, okay if we’ve got some objectives for this piece of ground,
46:55
some management objectives for the long-term and short-term, and we want
46:58
to make sure everything here is headed towards something.” In a broad sense,
47:04
the experimental research nature of the Andrews is the objective for the place.
47:10
But in terms of the management type objective for pieces of the Andrews,
47:15
they were trying to maintain as many options and much flexibility
47:19
for research, and we don’t know what direction it’s going to go.
47:21
What kind of options are going to make sense 5 or 10 years from now?
47:24
Just try to maintain as many options as possible.
47:28
People would come up to me on the district and say, “Can I do
47:31
pre-commercial thinning in this plantation?” Or, “Can I do pruning?” I
47:37
would try to go through and say, “Let’s see, what do we want this place to
47:41
look like over time so I can try and see if that makes sense, whether or
47:46
not we want to do that?” Usually, we didn’t have any idea what this place
47:49
would look like over time, because we were managing this whole establishment
47:52
to maximize research flexibility and opportunities for the long-term.
47:56
I don’t know if that makes any sense or not.
47:57
Yeah, it struck me when I was at your presentation on landscape planning,
48:03
that you have this experimental forest in the middle of this district.
48:08
You talk about long-term planning.
48:12
I was wondering if this experimental forest, which you say has as a higher
48:18
proportion of old- growth, has an influence on what you can do on other
48:22
parts of the district [Blue River]
48:26
? I think it does a little bit, because, especially since there hasn’t been
48:29
much manipulative activity in the last 25 years, the Andrews, in some sense,
48:35
it functions as kind of a reserve, which both sets up opportunities for a
48:40
landscape-scale monitoring standpoint in terms of being able to compare
48:43
with what’s happening in other parts of the watershed to the Andrews.
48:47
And also, I think in some people minds, there’s a pretty good size area where
48:52
there isn’t really much disturbance that can function as a refuge for
48:58
some species, like the spotted owl.
49:00
You
49:12
mentioned at the outset you’ve been involved with LTER
49:15
for about eight years now.
49:16
I’m curious in terms of how you make your
49:23
decisions, how you resolve issues that you encounter on a regular basis.
49:32
What functions does the LTER meeting serve in your view for
49:36
dealing with issues as they come up?
49:44
When I first started coming to those [LTER meetings] , I felt that one of
49:48
the purposes to go was to try and help make decisions about various things
49:51
around management of the Andrews, or research projects or whatever.
49:55
But I fairly quickly realized that that’s not the way the group works.
49:59
So, I usually think of the group as a way just to sort of share information.
50:05
You know, float things out there.
50:06
People have the chance to reflect on them, and get back if they have
50:09
any input or thoughts about it.
50:12
That’s kind of the way Fred, Art, and Lynn all look at these, so when we have
50:19
tough issues that actually need a decision of some kind at some point-of-time,
50:24
that decision will usually get made.
50:27
Fred, Art, Lynn, and I meet quarterly, and I put that agenda together
50:31
and facilitate that meeting, and I also put together things I think
50:35
we need to make decisions about.
50:38
We either make the decisions or decide who needs to talk to whom to gather enough
50:42
information and make sure all viewpoints are considered and figure it out.
50:49
That’s the level of decision that would be made at
50:53
with consideration, we’d be getting at the sharing at the LTER meetings?
50:58
Yeah, at least that’d usually be a part of it.
51:00
If it’s of any import to a wider group, we’re gonna get it out, generally
51:03
at one of these Friday meetings.
51:05
If there are people who aren’t there who need to hear about it, then it’s
51:08
in the written notes from the meeting.
51:10
We sort of rely on people who aren’t there to read those notes, because
51:13
it’s a big community of people, and probably only 20 percent or so are
51:16
actually here on any given Friday.
51:24
As far as I can tell, that is about as structured as we get
51:27
in our decision processes.
51:31
The four of us have been working together for about eight years, and you know Art
51:34
and Fred actually go back a lot longer.
51:37
We kind of know who needs to be involved and when it’s okay for one
51:42
of us to make a decision without the other one being involved.
51:46
We’ve got pretty good sense of that.
51:47
Is eight years a long time to be in a position
51:55
like
51:59
this?
52:00
Actually, when I moved at the position from Lowell [Ranger
52:03
District] to Blue River, [Ranger District] it was a promotion for me.
52:09
But eight years in the old Forest Service concept, would have been a long time.
52:18
But in the last ten years, there’s been quite a bit of change.
52:20
People have stayed in place a lot longer.
52:22
It has a lot to do with the downsizing, reduction of budgets, RIFs [reductions
52:24
in force] , and all that stuff.
52:27
People are less inclined to move around to a new job every two or three years.
52:36
For me, personally, this is the only kind of job I could stay in for this
52:41
long, because there’s so much change and so many new things built into it.
52:47
If there were similar job openings year-after-year, I
52:50
would have quit a long time ago.
52:52
You mentioned earlier on you’ve been able to build your own research program.
52:56
Oh yeah.
52:58
I’ve got a lot of flexibility and dealing with new and interesting
53:02
projects and people all the time.
53:05
That sort of fits my desires.
53:08
Do
53:29
you actually transcribe these tapes word-by-word, or do you
53:32
actually have somebody else do it?
53:34
Well, it’s about half-and-half right now for
53:38
stuff like this.
53:39
I’ll probably have someone else transcribe it for me.
53:41
When I do group interviews it’s a lot easier if I do it myself,
53:45
because I can track the interview.
53:47
Yeah, that’s the most time-consuming part of the process, actually.
53:51
Then I take that and I put it on the database where I can
53:56
search the information system.
53:58
What
54:02
I was starting to
54:05
ask is, as you worked with scientists with this group here,
54:12
you identified management issues in the Blue River District and at the Andrews,
54:17
especially on the Blue River District.
54:18
To
54:26
what extent did the scientists at the Andrews test [management
54:44
questions?]
54:48
Well, it’s a tough question to answer for a couple of reasons.
54:52
One is that management questions and needs at that time were in such a
55:01
period of disarray and change because the objectives were changing, and
55:06
you get a lawsuit and injunctions that say you can’t cut anything.
55:08
And then with Section 318 saying you
55:12
must cut 10 billion board feet in two years, then another
55:15
injunction and another plan.
55:17
Tremendous uncertainty and upheaval in 1990s, and right in the midst of it.
55:27
I think there were a significant number of people in the Andrews group
55:33
that were committed then, and are still committed to working on things
55:37
relevant to managers and policy makers and society; beyond just sort of “how
55:41
the system works” kinds of questions.
55:44
And there’s a significant number of people that are sort of interested in that kind
55:48
of stuff, but really would just as soon work on their research and don’t want to
55:51
be bothered by a whole lot, which is cool.
55:54
Who did you find yourself working with most closely
55:56
through that stuff you mentioned?
55:57
Fred and Art and Stan?
55:59
Stan and Gordon [Grant] . We had a tremendous amount of involvement
56:04
in the science group once we got the Augusta Creek project.
56:07
Field trips and camp outs, and there was a broad range of people
56:12
involved, including Steve Garman.
56:14
There were a lot of different people involved in that.
56:20
Andy Hanson when he first got here, was involved quite a bit; he was
56:25
real interested in working with managers.
56:26
He’s at Montana State
56:37
[University] now.
56:37
There are a fair number of people up here who loved to interact with managers,
56:42
and want their stuff to be known.
56:45
I think there are probably multiple motivations.
57:01
Maybe you could talk a little bit about
57:06
logistical concerns that affected the district and something like,
57:12
things like trends of increasing numbers of people coming out there.
57:19
How does that effect your role out there, or your concerns?
57:28
Well, I get lots of different kinds of things.
57:33
Lots of times people are looking for information, or looking
57:35
how to get something done.
57:37
People are looking for data about how to help them find [research] sites,
57:42
particularly on the kind of research projects that maybe we don’t have the
57:45
sites on the Andrews for one reason or
57:49
another.
57:49
People want to do something, so want to know if they need a permit, or what’s the
57:53
deal with the keys [gates/access] . As a site, the facility itself has grown up.
57:59
You know, Greg Downing and other folks working up there, had an increasing
58:04
need to use district facilities for purchasing and procurement
58:10
and personnel kinds of things.
58:14
People will want us to produce a GIS product for them, so I’ve had a GIS person
58:19
working for me since I’ve been there.
58:22
We try to provide that service to people from time-to-time,
58:26
even though the GIS operation up here is a lot more sophisticated.
58:31
Sometimes we have things that district they don’t have.
58:35
So,
58:40
for the most part the people at the district are used to taking
58:44
care of those things, and I don’t have to play much of a role.
58:49
More so in the earlier years when I was here, I would be directly involved, but I
58:52
think most people would just go to people they need to actually get the job done
58:57
for them, rather than going through me.
59:02
So, I think it’s pretty smooth.
59:03
Like
59:08
I say, things have grown in the last few years.
59:11
More people and more things.
59:14
The district in general has gotten more used to working
59:17
directly working with people.
59:19
Greg comes in or someone comes in looking for data, and they
59:24
may send it to me or send them
59:27
directly to whomever.
59:28
If they got a question about streams, maybe I’ll know the answer, but
59:33
probably a hydrologist in the district
59:37
can help better.
59:38
So, after eight years they just became more comfortable working
59:39
with each other it sounds like.
59:40
Have people in the district been fairly constant?
59:45
What’s the turnover like?
59:45
There’s been quite a bit of downsizing.
59:49
I think for a few years when I got here, there were maybe 80 employees,
59:49
and now we’re down to 40 or
59:54
45.
59:55
There’s been quite a bit of shrinkage.
59:57
In just this last year, there’s been turnover in some key positions.
1:00:05
But, there are some threads of continuity.
1:00:09
I’m not sure if I really understand your question,
1:00:14
entirely.
1:00:15
I was going to ask you if there are people who have been there
1:00:18
long-term over that 8-year period,
1:00:22
who have found it easy to deal with scientists at the Andrews without
1:00:25
any problems, and if people have become accustomed to going there.
1:00:25
One component of that question is the complexity of the number
1:00:25
of people working on the Andrews and who are real enmeshed with
1:00:37
it.
1:00:37
It’s not just the scientists
1:00:43
involved in different disciplines and graduate students.
1:00:44
How does
1:00:48
that kind of
1:00:54
complexity affect the job?
1:00:54
To a significant extent the Andrews runs on its own.
1:01:00
Most of the crews are graduate students working up there – OSU employees or
1:01:06
some other university or PNW employees.
1:01:11
And that’s not entirely true.
1:01:13
Sometimes the PNW employees need to use a computer for
1:01:19
paychecks, that kind of stuff.
1:01:20
So, they’ll come down and use that.
1:01:23
Right now, I have a crew of two working on the lichen monitoring project.
1:01:30
They are staying up at the Andrews, but they are Forest Service employees,
1:01:34
and they come down to the district to participate in a district function.
1:01:42
They are hired through the district and the district expects them to be behave
1:01:47
as district employees, and they’ll either be staying up at the Andrews
1:01:50
or working at the Andrews, so we kind of work through that case-by-case.
1:01:57
The safety issue is
1:02:06
big.
1:02:06
Prime case of the complexities is trying to
1:02:14
think about IT [Information Technology] . Here’s the Blue River
1:02:17
District, trying to keep track of its employees, radio call-ins,
1:02:21
check-in procedures, and all that.
1:02:23
There are 40 permanent and 30-40 summer employees.
1:02:27
And there’s the Andrews, a whole other group of 60-80
1:02:31
people there in the summer time.
1:02:33
They are employed by OSU, U of W, PNW, and there’s somebody from UC-Santa
1:02:39
Barbara or Oklahoma University.
1:02:42
Who’s responsible there for basic safety and check in procedures?
1:02:44
A very laissez-faire situation up to now, increasing incidences on safety,
1:02:51
the abduction this summer and all that,
1:02:56
can be kind of problematic for the [Willamette] forest to say,
1:03:00
“Hey, we’re going to be responsible for the 60-80 people who are
1:03:03
employed by the [Andrews] forest.”
1:03:23
How do scientists select sites off the Andrews, and what impact does that
1:03:26
have on what you were trying to do?
1:03:28
That includes the problem of integrating research efforts with management.
1:03:37
We used to get more of somebody from the district coming in and
1:03:40
saying, “That fellow is slacking out here.” “How does that relate
1:03:43
to my pruning project?” “Oh shit,
1:03:49
what pruning project?” It’s kind of overwhelming because we don’t have
1:03:52
an all-inclusive, up-to-the-minute data base, for every project.
1:03:57
What spatial and temporal dimensions, what things are being
1:04:01
sampled for another study going on?
1:04:03
You know, that would be a full-time job for somebody.
1:04:06
I was going to ask that.
1:04:07
Is there any kind of check-in procedure like that there?
1:04:10
Periodically.
1:04:11
The last time I did it was about 2 and 1/2 years ago.
1:04:16
I put it together working with my GIS person at the district.
1:04:22
The data base had a map location for every study underway.
1:04:27
Some people in the district were clamoring for that, saying, “Well, we’ve got to
1:04:30
know that so we can make sure we’re not conflicting.” Nobody ever used it.
1:04:34
So, I spent all this time and energy putting this together, and
1:04:37
it’s just a set of maps sitting in people’s piles somewhere.
1:04:42
[Laughter]
1:04:45
You know, we’re just not organized enough so that when someone says, “Oh, I want
1:04:48
to do a project here, then go to the data base, and pop, pop, pop, everything
1:04:51
that’s going on in that area comes up.”
1:04:56
It doesn’t work that easily. Consequently, if people don’t do it,
1:05:01
they come to me or Jim [Mayo] , and ask.
1:05:05
Would that be a common source of potential conflict?
1:05:10
What
1:05:12
would be the most likely areas of potential conflict between OSU
1:05:15
researchers or other researchers with management on district land?
1:05:22
Well, that’s a potential source.
1:05:24
It’s something that’s done for an activity affecting a research
1:05:27
project because of ignorance.
1:05:35
I can’t think of an example that’s actually been a problem.
1:05:37
I could think of a couple examples where it could have been a problem, but I
1:05:42
found out about it and headed it off.
1:05:46
Somebody came to me and said, “Well, this what we’re going to do and I just want
1:05:49
you to know,” and I said, “Okay, well,
1:05:53
time
1:05:56
out.” I think with those kinds of things,
1:06:00
the general reaction would tend to be more like, “Well, my God, that sounds stupid.
1:06:05
Why did we let that happen?” But probably, no long-term hard feelings.
1:06:09
People probably see that more as we got huge diverse programs.
1:06:13
And we’re not 100% organized about everything, and
1:06:19
shit happens.
1:06:20
That’s the kind of reaction I think for the most part.
1:06:22
The most conflicting kind of stuff comes around
1:06:28
things like
1:06:31
NEPA requirements and Endangered Species Act requirements.
1:06:35
Lynn and the forest [Will.
1:06:37
N.F.] perceive that one of the roles she’s legally bound to
1:06:43
have, is making projects that affect the environment go through the same
1:06:47
kinds of procedures to insure they’re in compliance with the laws, as
1:06:51
other activities on the district are.
1:06:55
People in the Andrews may perceive it as, “Hey, we‘re going to do this real minor
1:06:58
project here, and we’re going to upgrade our meteorological station, so we need
1:07:01
to build this little hundred-foot road.” “Well, hell, hundred-foot road on the
1:07:06
Andrews, that’s totally insignificant, how could that be significant to anything?
1:07:09
You know, we’ve got, hundreds of miles of road out here.” “We’re gonna cut down
1:07:13
four trees, and why do we have to wait for your biologists to come out here and do
1:07:19
a survey for spotted owls and every other species.” Botanists come out here and
1:07:23
check the plants, and archeologists come out here and check for cultural artifacts.
1:07:29
Then, do a NEPA process of public comment on this little teeny project. So, we’ve
1:07:34
had some rubs over that sort of stuff.
1:07:38
How is that usually resolved?
1:07:40
Case-by-case.
1:07:45
Try to get with it and try to do the minimum as quickly as
1:07:50
we can, with a minimum delay.
1:07:51
Try to
1:07:54
get something as detailed as possible.
1:07:56
We’ve had a couple blows on that where it’s taken too long from somebody’s
1:08:01
perspective, and a lot of paper work and the process hasn’t been concluded yet.
1:08:10
But,
1:08:14
relatively minor I’d say, and we really haven’t lost any
1:08:16
sleep over those kind of things.
1:08:19
I was going to ask you if there was any response to that.
1:08:28
There hasn’t been anything significant that, I’d really call it noteworthy.
1:08:32
What
1:08:41
is
1:08:45
your perception about the
1:09:00
significant accomplishments at Blue River District since you’ve been there?
1:09:05
I’m thinking of the area, the district in general, not just the Andrews.
1:09:14
Accomplishments at the Blue River District?
1:09:16
That you were involved in.
1:09:21
Well, I’m [chuckle] highly-biased.
1:09:25
First,
1:09:28
I think the Augusta Creek Project is far and away the most
1:09:32
significant thing that has happened.
1:09:37
Why?
1:09:38
Well, we really pioneered a different way of thinking about how landscape should
1:09:46
be planned to meet multiple integrated, ecological and commercial objectives.
1:09:53
We not only pioneered the concept, we took it to a level which showed the
1:09:59
linkage from the concept at the landscape scale to project implementation.
1:10:08
We were able to link a different way of thinking about and planning management
1:10:13
for a large landscape, and put it in a spatial and temporal context for people
1:10:18
that resulted in specific objectives
1:10:22
people could implement at a project level.
1:10:26
I think that’s real significant.
1:10:29
It’s going to take a while yet for that to play out, because it is a different
1:10:33
approach and it’s not the approach that is embodied in the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:10:38
I don’t know if Fred’s talked at all about that or not.
1:10:40
But, you’ve got the matrix, forest, reserves, and a
1:10:44
corridors-kind-of-conservation-biology-driven approach of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:10:49
We’ve really developed an ecosystem-dynamics approach based on
1:10:52
historical disturbance patterns and landscapes structures, which has some
1:10:58
very different implications for how these ecosystems are going to develop over time.
1:11:05
It results in a different way of managing the land.
1:11:09
Meanwhile, we‘ve got the Northwest Forest Plan with “matrix” and “riparian
1:11:12
reserves” all over the landscape.
1:11:15
We’ve spent years now developing and implementing this alternative
1:11:20
[disturbance-based] approach.
1:11:21
And through the landscape study we’re really going to implement
1:11:26
it and monitor over time to really be able to say anything with
1:11:29
substance about the consequences.
1:11:31
Augusta Creek is really where we developed all those concepts.
1:11:35
That was a really fertile time for integrating diverging or
1:11:44
different threads of research interests as well as management interests.
1:11:50
I think that’s really significant and the lessons we’re going learn out of
1:11:55
actually monitoring what’s happening on the ground in the Blue River Watershed,
1:11:59
are going to be really important for the next public policy spasm that comes around
1:12:04
and the windows and doors open again, for changing the way we are doing things.
1:12:09
I’m already seeing some cracks in the Northwest Forest Plan opening
1:12:13
up various places in the region.
1:12:15
People are just up against the wall for
1:12:20
a variety of issues, whether it’s listed coho salmon or municipal
1:12:25
water quality in the Salem watershed.
1:12:28
These things push people to say, “We’ve got to come up with something better in
1:12:31
the matrix riparian reserves.” In the approach we developed for the matrix
1:12:39
riparian reserves, we said, “Okay, we’re going to set aside these lands
1:12:41
and manage these lands intensively for timber.” And we’re taking a broader
1:12:45
perspective, “Let’s look at the function of the whole landscape and manage it on
1:12:49
a more integrated basis, so we’re not really managing any place with maximum
1:12:56
timber production as a primary goal.”
1:12:59
You’ve mentioned the Augusta Creek project several times.
1:13:05
Please talk about how that project originated and evolved.
1:13:10
It sounds like it became a model
1:13:17
in the timber planning process.
1:13:17
It took us years to get the Augusta Creek project and landscape plan tuned up to the
1:13:24
point where we felt pretty good about it.
1:13:26
Then we took those concepts and developed the landscape plan for the Blue River
1:13:30
watershed, which is about three times the size of Augusta Creek, in two weeks.
1:13:35
So, Augusta Creek is where all this stuff really developed.
1:13:39
Who was working with you at Augusta Creek?
1:13:41
Well, dozens of people.
1:13:47
The landscape work we did at Blue River prior to my arrival and the Lowell
1:13:57
“Skunkworks” project I was talking about, were really in sort of a mitigation
1:14:04
mode, maintaining some options in the short-term, by identifying more
1:14:08
significant blocks of old forest, and harvesting it somewhere else. It really
1:14:11
didn’t establish any broader objectives for what rates should we be harvesting and
1:14:16
at what intensity we should be harvesting.
1:14:17
It was more of a spatial pattern, to maintain some sort of options approach.
1:14:21
We got thinking about this shortly after I got to Blue River, and said, “Well,
1:14:26
we’ve got to do something with the landscapes.” My job, my mission here,
1:14:30
was to develop a landscape project.
1:14:31
It’s right here in my job description, and we started thinking, “Let’s
1:14:35
step back and be a little bit more
1:14:40
objective-driven from a broader perspective, then think about how do we
1:14:44
set objectives for landscape pattern and structure over a long period of time.”
1:14:48
So, we said, “One way we can do that is using historical patterns as a guide.
1:14:54
Let’s get a fire history study together which will examine historical patterns
1:14:58
by looking at the rates and intensity and spatial patterns of past fire
1:15:02
regimes, because fire has been the major disturbance agent that’s really set-up
1:15:05
landscape patterns.” Distribution of habitat is really what we were talking
1:15:08
about in landscape patterns; it’s the distribution of habitat types available.
1:15:10
There
1:15:16
were three of us, really, that
1:15:19
got that project started with the fire history; it was Miles
1:15:22
[Hemstrom] , Fred, and myself.
1:15:25
Then Jane Kertis
1:15:33
is the ecologist here with the Willamette [and Siuslaw National Forest], who
1:15:38
was working with Miles at that time and had a background of fire history.
1:15:43
She became very involved in setting up the field study and doing the
1:15:47
subsequent analysis of fire history data,
1:15:52
once the fire history data were compiled.
1:15:56
Then
1:16:05
I would get the information, and would make a stab at translating
1:16:09
it into a landscape management strategy, then describe it.
1:16:15
Maybe I‘d work with some people at the Blue River District that had
1:16:21
the information and expertise to give me piece of the story, and I
1:16:24
would try to put the story together.
1:16:26
Then I’d take it around and show it to people, whether it was one person or many.
1:16:31
We had many meetings and presentations up here in Corvallis.
1:16:35
In Friday afternoon meetings after our monthly meetings here, we’d look
1:16:41
at it and get people’s comments, like, “Oh, that’s interesting, but
1:16:44
you really need to…How about this?
1:16:45
You haven’t thought through this….” Some of that was at the broad conceptual
1:16:50
level, where people were saying, “Well, the historical pattern model is cool,
1:16:54
but here’s another concept…” So, we would debate the merits of those concepts.
1:16:59
We actually took those some of the concepts and developed them into landscape
1:17:02
strategies, and then modeled them out over time, compared them [alternative future
1:17:05
scenarios of landscape change] . A variety of work has gone into this over time.
1:17:10
As I mentioned earlier, we had field trips and overnight campouts, and
1:17:14
we’d sit around the campfire and
1:17:19
discuss the use of fire history data and how it would fit in with
1:17:22
landslides and habitats of this species or that species, and about carbon
1:17:31
cycles and storage of carbon and lots of different concepts and ideas.
1:17:37
That’s kind of the mode we operated in.
1:17:41
There’s been a change in some of the players,
1:17:45
maybe some of the same principle people you’re dealing with now were involved
1:17:50
in a lot of those early discussions and reviews and commenting on in reviews.
1:17:56
I’d could give you a list of names.
1:17:58
One indicator is that we got a publication on the Augusta plan published [PNW Station
1:18:03
General Technical Report] , with about 15 authors; the primary people up here,
1:18:07
with names I’ve already mentioned, Fred, Gordon, Stan, Steve, and Dede Olson.
1:18:13
I do not know if you know Dede, but she’s at PNW, an amphibian specialist.
1:18:13
Linda Ashkenas, and there’s three or
1:18:19
four people with the district.
1:18:21
Matt Hunter, I don’t know if you’ve met Matt or not.
1:18:24
He’s a grad student up here involved in a bunch of
1:18:32
other work.
1:18:32
And Cindy McCain and Jane.
1:18:33
Cindy works with Jane as the two ecologists for the Willamette
1:18:36
and Siuslaw National Forests.
1:18:37
They’ve both been instrumental.
1:18:40
When I would put something together, and say, “Well, I want to bounce
1:18:44
it off somebody,” I could always go talk to Jane and Cindy, and
1:18:47
they’d give me some feedback.
1:18:49
I thought, if I’d get enough ideas crystallized on what the next iteration
1:18:53
should look like, I’d take it back and put the plan together again.
1:18:58
The plan consists of a map of different zones representing different ways
1:19:03
things are done, forming a landscape mixing some reserves and different
1:19:07
rotation ages and retention levels and spatial patterns, where timber
1:19:11
harvest and prescribed fire were done.
1:19:14
Then I would actually map out more specific blocks in the ground, project
1:19:18
patterns out over time, basically showing how these activities would occur.
1:19:21
We would have these maps of landscape structure over time.
1:19:24
Then we eventually developed this for several scenarios, and compared the
1:19:29
scenarios in terms of spotted owl habitat or woodpecker habitat or whatever.
1:19:36
That’s kind of what the document of the Augusta Creek landscape plan paper is, the
1:19:39
results of comparing those two scenarios.
1:19:44
[Northwest Forest Plan and the disturbance-history-based plan]
1:19:45
When did that come out in publication?
1:19:47
Well it’s been in press, sitting in Portland for about six months now.
1:19:52
It’s supposedly got a ‘97 date on it.
1:19:54
So, it’s in press.
1:19:58
Do you have a draft copy that I can get?
1:20:00
Yeah, sure.
1:20:05
Fred’s got it.
1:20:07
Okay, I’ll check with him.
1:20:09
I’m sure Gordon and Steve and several other people up here, have it too.
1:20:20
We finally got to the point where it was pretty well tuned up, pretty
1:20:24
close to getting towards prime time.
1:20:27
The district was ready to do a timber sale down there, and was
1:20:29
using the guidelines in the paper.
1:20:33
The problem is that it’s a different strategy than the Northwest Forest
1:20:37
Plan, with riparian reserves and pretty intensive timber management in the matrix.
1:20:44
We got to the point where we said, “Well, what are we going implement with this
1:20:47
timber sale?” Wildlife biologists and others are trying to evaluate this timber
1:20:53
sale and they’re saying, “Well, if it’s going to be implemented in the context
1:20:57
of this broader landscape plan, then I think this about the risk to the species.
1:21:01
But, if it’s going to be implemented in the context of matrix and riparian
1:21:04
reserves [of Northwest Forest Plan] , then I think this about the project.” We
1:21:07
had to come to a fundamental decision.
1:21:09
We ended up getting in a discussion with the forest supervisor, and
1:21:11
eventually the regional forester [John Lowe] , and Tom Tuchmann.
1:21:14
I don’t know if you know that name, but he’s the White House Rep [Tuchman]
1:21:17
for the Northwest Forest Plan, and he was supposed to provide the White
1:21:20
House connection to the plan here.
1:21:24
We presented this to him, and he said, “This is really cool, this is great
1:21:29
I’m glad you guys are working on this. Should have been working on this a
1:21:31
long time ago, in fact it’s so good.
1:21:33
You should go ahead on this and implement it full speed ahead and monitor.
1:21:38
But, do it in the AMA [Central Cascades Adaptive Management Area] . Or, if you
1:21:40
want, amend it in the Northwest Forest Plan, so Augusta Creek in the AMA.”
1:21:44
That was the only thing I have been surprised about in this interview;
1:21:46
you haven’t asked about the Adaptive Management Area [AMA] . That’s
1:21:49
a fairly significant evolution in our program of activities.
1:21:58
We said, “We are
1:22:03
not going to amend the Northwest Forest Plan to include Augusta Creek in an AMA.
1:22:05
That will take too long, too much hassle.
1:22:07
We can develop this same strategy for the Blue River watershed, which is in the
1:22:11
AMA, which includes the Andrews, which has this long history of data sets, and
1:22:15
which has a variety of long term projects.
1:22:17
It’s a better place
1:22:21
for monitoring, and we can implement it without all these hassles and all
1:22:23
these questions because we’ve got more flexibility in the AMA to do different
1:22:26
things.” So, that’s how we got to the Blue River Project from Augusta Creek.
1:22:33
So now the district [Blue River] has sold one sale and is getting ready
1:22:36
to sell another sale implementing the guidelines of the landscape project.
1:22:41
We have multiple monitoring projects under way.
1:22:46
That’s what we’ve set up.
1:22:47
That’s what I’m trying to set-up specifically, and putting the energy
1:22:49
into getting this thing established as an administrative study, to get
1:22:53
the resources to really get the monitoring done at multiple scales.
1:22:57
There are going to be plenty of other places where matrix
1:22:59
and riparian reserves are being applied so we can compare to them.
1:23:03
There’s the wilderness areas where nothing is really happening.
1:23:05
There’s the Andrews, which is kind of a reserve and compare it at a certain scale.
1:23:09
Then, at the larger scale we can compare it to the industrial landscapes.
1:23:13
Remote sensing data can give us a broad look, at least at how habitats
1:23:17
are developed and distributed across large parts of the watershed.
1:23:21
The Augusta Creek study set the stage for the Blue River Landscape Management
1:23:29
Plan, and took just two weeks to work up?
1:23:33
In terms of developing the basics of the landscape plan itself.
1:23:39
Augusta Creek took years.
1:23:41
It was an on-again, off-again effort.
1:23:43
They would go for 6 months without doing much.
1:23:45
It was pretty much me working on it in my spare time.
1:23:50
It wasn’t like going work for 60% of your time on Augusta.
1:23:53
I had basic stuff to keep going, and then fit in work on Augusta as
1:23:56
best I could.
1:23:58
I interacted with as many people as I could to get feedback or get it
1:24:01
tuned up, but it was pretty much me.
1:24:04
There weren’t any resources or any team assigned to this thing
1:24:10
until we got ready to do the final analysis of scenarios.
1:24:14
Then we pulled together this team of the authors of this
1:24:17
paper that you’ll eventually see.
1:24:20
We went to Blue River, and we had the advantage that the
1:24:23
watershed analysis was completed.
1:24:26
“Watershed analysis” is the basic compilation of data that all watersheds
1:24:33
have had analysis done under the Northwest Forest Plan. That’s one
1:24:36
component of the forest plan that is supposed to be completed before
1:24:41
further management activities.
1:24:41
We had that advantage.
1:24:42
Basic data were already compiled.
1:24:45
We put together a team of people for two weeks,
1:24:50
but it wasn’t two weeks non-stop.
1:24:51
It was a day here, day there, kind of thing.
1:24:53
The team was composed of three people from the ranger district, two
1:24:59
people from up here, and then myself.
1:25:03
We crafted the basics of the landscape plan in two weeks because all the
1:25:08
thinking-process work we did in Augusta, and that’s really helped
1:25:10
in developing the Blue River plan.
1:25:18
Do you see this as a good model
1:25:26
for going forward in other areas?
1:25:28
I think
1:25:31
the potential is there and that it has yet to be seen, now that the
1:25:35
public policy debates are to play out.
1:25:37
It’s still an open question for me if national forests are even
1:25:40
going to be cutting timber.
1:25:42
If they’re not going to be cutting trees, then the landscape patterns will
1:25:47
be pretty well-set by past cutting.
1:25:48
It would be a case of don’t do anything and let it grow.
1:25:51
That might be how things go and this won’t be relevant, at least, on
1:25:54
national forests in the short-term.
1:25:55
It may be more relevant in some other places, some other
1:25:58
country, or some other situation.
1:26:00
But, there’s a lot of interest in this now, both nationally and internationally.
1:26:05
Actually, we talk about it with a lot of groups of people.
1:26:10
People in other countries working with similar concepts have been real
1:26:15
interested in trying to track this and use some of this information.
1:26:19
There has been a lot of conceptual work on using historical
1:26:26
information, and not a lot of
1:26:29
actual application set in an operational context.
1:26:32
This is something we’ve done and demonstrated in an operational context.
1:26:37
I’m hoping it’s something that can be
1:26:40
replicated in other places.
1:26:43
For example, usually I talk about this with other managers.
1:26:49
I’ve been talking about it 2 or 3 dozen times a year for 6, going on 7 years.
1:26:54
The usual reaction I get from managers is,
1:26:58
“Good thing, glad you are working on it. It’s not helpful to me because I have to
1:27:01
deal with riparian reserves and matrixes.
1:27:04
Those are in the Northwest Plan, that’s the plan I have to deal with.”
1:27:09
Last week I went and talked to the Detroit Ranger District.
1:27:13
After I was done describing it, the ranger turned to me and said, “Can
1:27:17
you come up here and help us do this?” I said, “Well that’s interesting.
1:27:22
“What watershed are you talking about?” He said, “Well, the whole district.”
1:27:28
I described some of the problems we ran into in trying to implement
1:27:31
it, and the problems of zoning for matrix and riparian reserves.
1:27:34
He said, “I understand that, and that’s going to be something we’re going to
1:27:36
have to deal with, but, if we don’t do something ecologically-oriented
1:27:42
across the watershed, we aren’t going to do anything because of the issues
1:27:45
we’ve got: water quality in the Salem municipal watershed, blah, blah, blah.”
1:27:50
To me, what I’m starting to see is there are some cracks starting to appear
1:27:54
in that matrix and riparian reserve strategy in the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:27:58
Sooner or later, there’s going to have to be some changes or adjustments.
1:28:01
I want us to be in position when that sooner or later arrives, we
1:28:05
have not only the concepts and the applications represented in on-the-ground
1:28:09
demonstrations, but also some actual empirical data that says we need
1:28:13
the data to get what you are doing.
1:28:14
That’s the thrust of what we’re trying to do,
1:28:19
so we’ll be ready for the opportunity when it arrives.
1:28:22
Do you have any connection with state forestry or private forestry
1:28:28
in developing these kinds of plans?
1:28:32
Only in an information sharing and feedback kind of mode.
1:28:37
The Augusta and Blue River plans have been developed in pretty
1:28:40
much all federal ownerships.
1:28:43
There has been an interesting change over time, where in the early ‘90’s industry
1:28:52
folks would come up and just see something as simple as a green-tree retention
1:28:58
harvest unit and shake their heads.
1:29:00
And some of them did a lot more than shake their heads.
1:29:03
We’ve seen some people, some leaders, some timber industry leaders, get livid
1:29:08
in front of a group of 60-80 people, and say pretty derogatory stuff about people
1:29:14
because we were leaving these green trees, that they saw as a tremendous
1:29:16
waste of resources, economically irresponsibility, etc., etc. A couple
1:29:22
of years later some of those same folks or similar folks were coming up and
1:29:26
saying, “I kind of understand why you do this on federal land, but you sure
1:29:32
as hell shouldn’t be telling anybody to do it on private land.” Couple of
1:29:36
years ago we were contacted by some of these timber industry lobbying groups.
1:29:40
Some of the people locally you
1:29:44
see in the paper, Chris West, or some of those kinds of folks.
1:29:48
They were doing a
1:29:51
Congressional staffers tour, and they wanted to come out and see what we were
1:29:57
doing here about the landscape project.
1:30:00
So, the whole context has shifted so radically in a few years.
1:30:04
I think the reason they wanted to do that was just to try and impress upon those
1:30:09
folks not that this is the best way in the world to manage a landscape, but to give
1:30:14
them a sense of the scope of the things that are being considered and integrated
1:30:19
from an ecological point-of-view when coming up with those kinds of plans.
1:30:23
I’m not quite sure what to think about all that, but its kind of
1:30:27
remarkable to me how that’s changed in a relatively short amount of time.
1:30:31
It strikes me that you were talking about the potential for the national forests
1:30:36
to get out of the timber business.
1:30:38
I guess the state is just considering right now, legislation to make the
1:30:44
state forests basically for timber
1:30:50
production?
1:30:51
I understand the motivations for people that are trying to stop
1:30:55
cutting trees on federal lands.
1:30:57
But, I think it would be a real shame if the only options available were
1:31:02
either cut it all or leave it all.
1:31:05
If there aren’t any in-between options out there, we’ve really have lost it all.
1:31:09
All those places where we’re saying, “Cut it all,” we’ve given
1:31:13
up a hell of a lot ecologically, biological diversity, habitat.
1:31:21
I think about that a lot.
1:31:26
I think that trying to find some better options for managing land,
1:31:31
involving timber harvest from an ecological point-of-view is
1:31:35
a valuable thing to be doing.
1:31:36
I’m just trusting that our political processes aren’t going to leave us in
1:31:41
the boat where those are the only two options are to cut it all or leave it all.
1:31:46
What you are saying is that the political processes haven’t impeded
1:31:48
you from developing a strategy at
1:31:55
least?
1:31:55
Not from implementing it in the
1:32:00
AMA.
1:32:00
If it hadn’t been for the political processes, we probably
1:32:02
would have implemented Augusta Creek a couple years ago.
1:32:10
I think we are able to develop, implement, and evaluate it within
1:32:15
the confines of the Blue River watershed and in the AMA for now.
1:32:20
We’ll see how big those cracks open up here in the next few years.
1:32:25
Well I should probably let you get
1:32:28
back to work here, it’s been a long time.
