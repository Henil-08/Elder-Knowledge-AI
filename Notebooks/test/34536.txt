00:00
[tape begins mid-sentence] …the block [funding/tasks] wasn’t big enough
00:02
for both of them, that type of thing.
00:04
Although, I must say, they reached an accommodation.
00:09
But early on, Dick [Waring] was really influential in what
00:19
we were studying.
00:20
So the IBP was kind of a selling point, but
00:29
also provided the funding, kind of a structure it would have actually imposed
00:31
on the group that was working out there?
00:31
Yeah, that was the watershed-type thing.
00:32
Am I in your way [speaking to Acker]
00:36
? I was just going to get a copy of that paper I was telling you about.
00:46
Okay [banging in background] . This is probably the last point
00:46
I wanted to address today.
00:46
I’ll be talking to Jerry Franklin and then I’ll probably be coming back to
00:48
you to revisit some of these themes, but I wanted to get your sense of
00:52
how people viewed the purpose of an experimental forest in the period.
00:54
How they viewed what?
00:54
The purpose of experimental forests in the period of, about ’70 to ’74.
00:57
We talked about that in relation to the earlier period, I think.
00:57
Here.
00:57
[Paper he had been looking for]
01:04
What’s
01:06
that?
01:07
Oh, it’s the paper I was mentioning earlier.
01:11
Oh, great.
01:11
That would be good background
01:14
for him [Geier] , as far
01:25
as where the permanent plots and things are.
01:25
Yeah.
01:25
Thanks.
01:25
[Brief conversation between Dryness and Acker concerning
01:32
vacation plans, office schedules, etc.]
01:33
Take care [to Acker] . He’s a good guy and a really outstanding example of
01:40
this new generation that’s come along.
01:44
He’s really sharp
01:47
as far as technical competence.
01:50
He’s probably a lot better
01:55
than we were.
02:00
I was trying to get a sense of how, what you think perceptions were in
02:06
the period about the time the IBP was established, and shortly after that,
02:09
about the purpose of research was for the
02:14
Andrews itself, and how people viewed that?
02:17
The view towards experimental forests?
02:19
Yeah.
02:19
As opposed to that earlier period.
02:22
Early on, the Forest Service went through a stage when
02:26
experimental forests were big.
02:29
That’s when the Wind River was established, Pringle
02:33
Falls, and H.J. Andrews.
02:36
Then, in
02:38
the late ‘50s, early ‘60s,
02:44
the emphasis was on labs, “We’re getting real scientific now.
02:48
We’re gonna have labs.” They put the labs on the university campuses.
02:54
And I think that turned into the idea, “Well,
03:03
the experimental forests aren’t really important anymore.” So, a lot of people
03:06
had to fight tooth-and-nail to preserve the experimental forests we’ve got today.
03:13
Because the people who got them running, they may be at the Washington D.C. level,
03:17
maybe at the headquarters at the station [PNW] , so that’s a thing of the past.
03:22
We’re beyond experimental forests.
03:31
We fought the same thing on research
03:38
natural areas.
03:39
They said, “Why have these things when we’re not using them?” That’s
03:44
why we needed a program like the IBP, or LTER, today. We needed that to
03:52
give us some kind of funds to attract people to work in these areas. And
03:58
that’s why we, Jerry, had the brilliant idea of putting out this publication
04:04
[sound of papers shifting—pause]
04:06
. That’s the Guide to Research Natural Areas in Oregon and
04:08
Washington [USFS Publication, Sarah Greene, Jerry Franklin, et.
04:09
al.,]
04:09
. Yeah.
04:10
Because we said, people at the universities don’t
04:13
know about these places.
04:16
What they offer in terms of research opportunities, where they are,
04:21
and who administers them, so we needed to get this guidebook out.
04:27
That’s been a good deal.
04:29
That came out in 1972?
04:32
[Early incarnation of what became 1986 guide.]
04:38
Then we followed that up with
04:45
this with another publication] . We asked, what would a good, well-rounded
04:47
system of natural areas look like in the Pacific Northwest?
04:51
This is the one that laid out a grid of cells?
04:55
All the cells we were going to fill.
04:57
Yeah.
05:00
And that’s what I was working on just before I transferred to Alaska.
05:05
Just before this came your way, and about the time IBP was established, which as
05:12
you pointed out, kind of saves the experimental forest idea, I’ve heard Fred
05:16
Swanson mention there was a letter written proposing to disestablish the Andrews?
05:20
Are you familiar with that?
05:21
Yeah!
05:22
Yeah.
05:23
Yeah.
05:23
He wasn’t sure if that was a rumor, as he’d never seen the letter, but
05:26
he said that Jerry told him about it.
05:28
I think that you’d have to ask Jerry about that.
05:31
Because, that’s how far it went, that they were really proposing to
05:35
disestablish or de-activate the Andrews.
05:35
You know, come on!
05:37
Hello?!
05:40
I think we’re past that now.
05:42
We’ve got millions of dollars of research there, and it’s an international gem.
05:47
[Internationally-recognized scientific research site.]
05:47
Yeah.
05:47
It’s an international gem.
05:48
From
05:52
talking to Art McKee, it sounds now it’s more about who gets credit for it.
05:55
Yeah.
05:56
And who gets to control it.
05:57
Yeah.
05:57
Yeah.
05:57
Instead of getting rid of it.
05:58
And you know, that’s why it’s such an ironic thing.
06:04
We were ignored.
06:05
Sure,
06:08
“You guys can go out and have fun, but you’re really not doing
06:12
anything.” And now, everyone wants to take the credit for it?
06:18
Like I say, it was very grass-roots.
06:21
Really grass-roots.
06:23
Guys like [OSU College of Forestry Dean] George Brown and the director of the
06:25
[PNW] station, they don’t even know what’s going on [at the HJA EF] . To a certain
06:31
extent, Fred’s probably glad about that.
06:34
You know, “Keep out of my hair and we’ll do our thing.” But it’s not
06:39
top-down. It’s just purely bottom up.
06:42
It’s bottom-up.
06:43
Roy Silen related a similar thing relating to your perception
06:46
of the experimental forests.
06:48
Silen was talking about when he was there in the early ‘50s, how the snows
06:52
would come down and they’d get closed in, he’d get involved in this social
06:57
circle of dinners around the local community, and there was kind of a
07:00
sense that it was pretty isolated.
07:02
He said nobody really knew what was going on up on the forest [PNW
07:04
Station or Region] , but there was a sense of close interaction
07:06
with the local residents there.
07:07
Uh-huh.
07:07
I was just wondering if you had any sense of how that evolved, from
07:11
the period you were there, from the late ‘50s through the early ‘70s?
07:15
Did that continue or dissipate?
07:18
That community [dynamics – HJA and locals] in Blue River?
07:20
Yeah.
07:20
In other words, how did people that lived around Blue River perceive
07:22
or interact with people who were
07:27
working
07:30
on the experimental forest, or at all?
07:30
There wasn’t very much.
07:31
Principally, the concerns were, did it contribute to the accommodations
07:38
there, the motel industry.
07:42
But did people previously stay in motels?
07:46
I’m trying to remember if there are any in Blue River.
07:50
There’s one or two down near McKenzie Bridge.
07:54
If
07:56
you’re going east on the highway, to the north of the highway, there’s
08:04
a restaurant and motel nearby.
08:12
They are used on occasion.
08:13
I remember, we had an LTER meeting a couple of years before I moved
08:18
back [from Alaska] , that involved
08:22
bringing people from across the West, and
08:29
we stayed in a motel there.
08:32
There were meetings like that.
08:33
There was just not the capacity for
08:41
an administrative
08:45
site.
08:45
Did you make use of the restaurants then?
08:48
Oh yeah, we used
08:52
to always make use of the restaurants.
08:56
This kind of question, you ought to ask Al [Levno] . He’d
09:00
have a lot better feel for it.
09:01
Yeah.
09:01
Because he was living on site there, too.
09:03
He was living there on site,
09:07
and Art [McKee] , too.
09:08
He would know.
09:10
Art still knows a lot of the people there, but I don’t.
09:20
I think the community [locals] really doesn’t know what’s
09:23
going on, or the gem the HJA is.
09:28
Although, from time-to-time, recently, they’ve tried to invite community
09:33
members up for a “show-me” trip. It
09:38
kind of blew up around them and they didn’t know what was going on.
09:44
There may even be some Forest
09:57
Service people down there [Blue River] who didn’t know, but now, everybody knows.
09:59
I remember the distinct feeling that we were just irrelevant, as
10:11
far as they were concerned.
10:12
Last year, you mentioned something [more in relation to Alaska] about up there,
10:16
that you had pretty easy access to the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest.
10:19
You’d drive up there, 15-20 miles outside of town, and you
10:22
would come back in the evening.
10:23
Then, down here, you almost have to go down there and spend the day or evening.
10:26
Oh yeah, we always used to spend a
10:31
week at a time.
10:32
We’d
10:35
go down Monday morning and stay in the trailer until maybe Friday night.
10:43
I remember what I used to do in order to keep track of what’s going on at home, by
10:53
the phone booth.
10:54
Did
11:09
you pretty frequently run into other researchers during those
11:11
trips, or were you usually there
11:19
by yourself?
11:19
What would happen was, especially after IBP,
11:26
we were bulging at the seams in the little 8 x 30 foot trailer.
11:33
I remember, we had technicians going out to these reference stands, and one of
11:39
the ways to measure moisture stress in vegetation is to use a pressure bomb,
11:47
which is a pressure chamber you put a twig in and exert pressure, and the pressure
12:01
needed to exude some sap out of this twig, is directly proportional
12:10
to the tension it’s under, so it’s a measure of moisture stress.
12:16
One of the primary times to do this is pre-dawn.
12:20
It’s called “pre-dawn moisture stress measurement,” because
12:25
that’s when it’s lowest, and it’s kind of at equilibrium, and there’s
12:30
no sun shining or any force put on it
12:40
to trigger evapotranspiration.
12:41
We used to send out guys in the middle of the night to do this, and
12:46
our favorite thing was to do was to fill them with Sasquatch stories,
12:55
before they went out!
13:00
[Laughing] We got
13:05
a good bit of hilarity out of that kind of thing.
13:13
That was the fun of it, as you have people working on different
13:17
things; small mammal people talking to the silviculturists, people
13:24
measuring fire intervals, and talking to the vegetation
13:28
classifiers, all that kind of stuff.
13:30
And that led toward
13:40
the “pulse” idea.
13:41
[See previous reference.]
13:41
Huh?
13:41
[Asking for clarification on “pulse.”]
13:42
We would go other places and have this same kind of interaction going on.
13:47
We
13:49
worked together all day, then sat around the campfire at night, sharing what
13:56
you observed and what questions you
14:02
had.
14:02
That was the first “pulse.” I only went on one or two, because the pulse idea
14:07
hit its stride after I went to Alaska.
14:10
The
14:13
first one was to the
14:17
Mt. Adams area on the Steamboat
14:22
RNA.
14:22
Jerry wanted to get some permanent plots
14:27
put in.
14:27
It was
14:31
Jerry, Art McKee, and Bob Woodmansee was visiting, an ecologist back east now.
14:43
That was an attempt to get some field work on an RNA done in a short interval.
14:54
What we did was stay at campgrounds, but we ate at the
15:03
Trout Lake District of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.
15:08
They had a mess hall for crews and we just signed up and ate at the mess hall,
15:15
and sat around our campfire at night.
15:21
It was a really, really fun deal.
15:23
As I recall, as our
15:29
family camped out a lot, I used to have the family come up at the end,
15:34
so we could get some of camping
15:41
in, and go up to Mt. Rainier, for which I took a few days off at the end.
15:45
I was going to ask you whether your family ever camped out at the Andrews.
15:46
Camped out there, or wherever?
15:49
Not a great deal, although we did make a point, Jerry and I, several times.
15:55
We said, “Let’s bring our kids this time, or pick a kid, the oldest one,
16:01
probably.” At that time, my oldest was 8 or 9, and she still talks
16:16
about it. What I did,
16:19
come to think of it, was when I took time off for vacation, especially when the kids
16:28
were real small, you might have noticed on the way up to the Andrews, there’s
16:34
cabins by the river that you can rent?
16:36
Yeah.
16:37
We used to rent a cabin, then go to the Andrews, and I’d fish up Lookout Creek.
16:44
That’s the way the family would engage, in part, in reaction to the
16:48
claim, “Daddy’s there all the time.” And they want to know what it’s like.
16:58
Time was when Jerry, in the early ‘70s, I remember him getting on this.
17:05
Jerry gets on these kicks, you know,
17:09
what to worry about now, and he said, “Well, what we ought to do is buy property
17:16
up at Blue River, so we can retire there!” [Laughter] Which never really came to
17:27
fruition, but it shows you what a special place we thought it was.
17:30
That’s an interesting dynamic there.
17:33
And I think, can I suggest a title?
17:37
Sure.
17:37
“A Special Place,” something like that. The H.J. Andrews, the first 40 or 50 years
17:38
on the H.J. Andrews, something like that. But, “A Special Place.” Use the phrase.
17:39
You know, there’s something I could probably do.
17:40
The first chapter there, I’m looking at the idea of a sense of place.
17:43
Yeah.
17:49
Dig in.
17:50
Are you going
18:07
to get some history on the Indians in the area?
18:12
Yeah.
18:13
Early sheepherders?
18:14
I probably will have something, what I can find.
18:16
I’ve got some friends in anthropology who’ve studied that area.
18:21
Good.
18:21
That
18:24
would be kind of
18:28
neat.
18:30
I’m hoping this is going to be kind of a common interest history.
18:34
I can give it to people who don’t know anything about ecology, and
18:39
they’ll be interested in this.
18:40
I think it’s really got a lot of potential here for that.
18:41
That’s what Bill Lang [Portland State University history professor and
18:41
editor of book series in which Geier hoped to publish Andrews history] is
18:42
interested in, really, is that it sells.
18:44
So, I want to do that, and still keep it interesting enough so
18:51
people who are informed about this, will like it.
18:53
I think an informed layman might be the best target.
18:56
Getting back to the community-at-large in Blue River, I think we have always
19:01
been kind of a community apart,
19:06
except for those guys that lived there all the time.
19:11
But we would always mainly hang out with the other researchers.
19:18
Although, I can remember times where you’d go down to the local tavern and dance
19:24
with the local gals, and stuff like that.
19:25
But it wasn’t that much.
19:30
It was kind of a rare occasion when that happened.
19:35
Was there a favorite hangout in Blue River that you’d go down to?
19:38
Yeah, early on.
19:40
It was called the Cougar Room.
19:40
It burned down later.
19:42
Cougar Room?
19:44
Yeah.
19:45
At one time it had “go-go” dancers [topless for a period] , which
19:50
made it more attractive, sometimes.
19:56
It was kind of the local joint.
20:01
Remember, I mentioned this meeting we had down at the Andrews in
20:05
the late ‘80s, and we ate there.
20:09
It was just before the thing burned down.
20:12
Now
20:19
it’s burned down.
20:19
Did you go into the town of Blue River?
20:20
Yeah, we drove through.
20:22
Yeah, and there’s this café here and a grocery store there, and then
20:26
you go out and you join the bypass?
20:29
Yeah.
20:30
Right at that “Y,” was the Cougar Room [where it was located]
20:31
. That was there until the ‘80s?
20:37
Yeah.
20:38
I don’t know how much of a hangout, but
20:42
to go and have a beer and stuff.
20:46
Well, that’s pretty important to the idea of a community, a
20:51
home-away-from-home kind of a thing.
20:52
Yeah.
20:52
Yeah.
20:52
Yeah.
20:54
Place where you’re likely to run into someone else by accident.
20:56
Oh, yeah.
20:59
When we lived in the trailer at Blue River Heights [name for residential area above
21:03
Blue River Ranger District] , people would always stop by and see who was there.
21:08
I remember, Jerry especially, if he had to write a manuscript, he’d go there,
21:16
because it was away from the office, and he’d feel the “muse” better at Blue River
21:26
than he would in Corvallis. He’d drive off and work.
21:29
That ties in
21:31
with what Fred was saying, people using the Andrews as a refuge and
21:41
source of inspiration.
21:41
And Art, he has a little cabin, a little summer house there.
21:45
Oh, is that right?
21:46
Yeah, at the administrative site.
21:47
It’s
21:50
sort of a little place.
21:50
As director of the forest [HJA] , he goes down there and hikes.
21:52
It’s great.
21:56
I had a little field trip when I was down there.
21:56
We had a little picnic there, and that was one of the more relaxing days I’ve
21:59
had in
22:01
a long time.
22:04
Yeah.
22:04
It’s a therapeutic place.
22:05
I was just thinking that I’m real interested in the community dynamics up
22:09
there, comparing it to Bonanza Creek, where you had people who were going
22:14
out and working and then coming back, and the [Fairbanks, Alaska - USFS]
22:16
lab was the site of interaction.
22:17
Uh-huh.
22:18
Then, here at the Andrews, people go there from all sorts of different areas here [in
22:21
Corvallis] , but they don’t interact here as much as they interact there [Alaska]
22:24
. Yeah.
22:26
The administrative site is now the community hub.
22:29
They play volleyball, and there’s people, lots of kids, undergrads,
22:37
that research program for undergrads at NSF [Research
22:38
Experience for Undergraduates] , and
22:42
graduate students from all over the country.
22:44
They converge on that site.
22:45
People are
22:52
catching the idea and the vision.
22:55
It’s just amazing.
22:57
It’s interesting to know the impact that has on the kind
22:59
of science that’s done there.
23:00
You mentioned the pulse idea, which kind of grows out of that basic idea?
23:03
Yeah!
23:03
That spurt of creative energy, and then people go off and have time
23:06
to kind of assimilate those ideas, and then come back and reconnect.
23:12
It’s a different pattern, and it was also true at Fairbanks, where you
23:15
had this continual family connection going on there all the time.
23:19
You’ve worked at both places.
23:20
Do you have any sense of that dynamic?
23:23
I remember when I got to Fairbanks,
23:29
I thought this is kind of anachronistic.
23:30
I’m in the middle of the wilderness here, but yet, I can do
23:35
fieldwork and be home every night!
23:37
I also thought, “But this is kind of nice.”
23:45
It does place a strain on family when you’re gone just about all summer.
23:53
I remember when I would come home from an arduous week of tromping up and
23:59
down those slopes in the watersheds
24:03
[HJA] . Every day is a picnic in the woods, and you joke about that, bring
24:08
your lunch and your pack, that everyday indeed is a “picnic in the woods.” “We
24:12
get paid for doing this?” You’re right.
24:14
But when I come home, the family’s been around home all week, and they
24:18
might want to go have a picnic, and even that could cause friction, because
24:24
I want to stay and lay in front of the TV, and watch a baseball game.
24:28
Something stupid like that would be a source of a little friction.
24:40
Most of that time my family was living on a small farm, so there was concern
24:48
about getting the hay in, and I wasn’t there except, maybe, weekends.
24:53
That
24:56
was in the Corvallis area?
24:57
Yeah, we lived on an 8-acre farm on Tampico Road.
25:04
If you’re familiar, on Tampico road there are a few minor bends, and then
25:10
it takes a big bend to the right.
25:13
If you go straight, you’d run into the place we used to have.
25:16
Yeah, we almost bought a place out there.
25:17
Is that right?
25:18
Yeah, we came real close to it last year.
25:21
It was right before you get to the road that goes over to the dump.
25:24
Oh, is that right?
25:25
Yeah.
25:25
And that was the blow that turned us against it.
25:28
I don’t know if you’ve been out there recently, but that
25:30
dump has gotten so huge.
25:31
Yeah.
25:31
And I was really concerned that, potentially, trash from the dump, would be
25:36
right up against the back of the property.
25:37
It was about a 10-acre piece, and the dump was right up against
25:39
the back boundary, and that’s not what I wanted for a neighbor.
25:42
[Laughter]
25:42
Yeah.
25:42
Yeah.
25:43
That’s what turned me against it, but otherwise it was a beautiful place.
25:47
We really enjoyed it, because there’s nobody on either
25:50
side of us, nobody in back.
25:51
Now there are houses in back, but when we were there, nothing.
25:58
That was one of the things that was hard to leave, because we’d just remodeled
26:03
the house, gotten all new carpets down,
26:09
we’d planted an orchard with any kind of fruit tree you could think of.
26:16
I had a strict spray schedule, as I take “orcharding” very seriously.
26:23
We had ponies for the kids, we raised cattle, and had a small
26:30
feed-lot operation kind of thing.
26:33
Buy feeders.
26:35
I’d call home and something’s gone wrong with the well.
26:40
I’d
26:43
be down in Blue River.
26:46
“What do I do?” It had its frustrations. Getting hay in with a small operation
26:57
like that is hard, and I didn’t have any tractor or anything.
26:59
I had to get a guy to cut the hay, rake it and bale it.
27:04
For a small place like that, nobody wanted to even do it.
27:07
Do you see any difference between the kind of research programs
27:23
that developed at the Andrews in comparison to Bonanza Creek?
27:23
Well, a big difference between the
27:35
Andrews
27:38
and
27:42
Bonanza Creek was the number of people.
27:44
We just really had a skeleton crew there at Bonanza Creek.
27:51
That had its advantages, because I used to think that up there, every person was more
28:01
valuable, because there was just so few.
28:03
Every person had their role to play.
28:09
If somebody crapped out on you, you really feel it.
28:14
Here, there are backups in just about any discipline you can name.
28:19
It
28:24
boggles your mind how many people are involved.
28:27
Would you say you get more of a sense of continuity, then?
28:31
How’s that?
28:33
Down here [HJA] , I mean.
28:36
You said that part of the puzzle could always be filled by somebody.
28:39
That would prevent having gaps?
28:40
Yeah.
28:41
But
28:43
there’s more feeling that you’re dispensable here, I think.
28:47
Oh, I see.
28:50
And you don’t feel that up there, as you really have a role to
28:54
play, and you’re really valued.
28:56
So, I’ve got to think
29:00
about this, as far as commuting every day and not commuting.
29:08
I think you may be on to something that does cause a change in
29:15
-- Well, it would be different, I’m sure.
29:19
I would guess that there might be some kind of an impact on the kinds of projects
29:22
you would be willing to take on, versus ones that you really wanted to do?
29:25
It wouldn’t necessarily mean better research or worse research, it
29:27
would just be the kind of work you take on, if there’s a difference.
29:33
You might think about that, if anything occurs to you.
29:36
Yeah, I’ll think about it.
29:36
Because, like I say, the overwhelming difference I always think about,
29:39
is just the number of people.
29:42
We really had a skeleton crew [Alaska] . Of course, with Keith
29:47
[Van Cleve] retiring, Les [Viereck] is ready for retirement now, Skeeter
29:50
[Richard Warner] is retiring,
29:55
and of course,
30:00
[mumbled asides] . Herman [Gucinski] really tried to rectify that,
30:08
and the first step was maybe to get Terry [Chapin] to stay.
30:15
Do you know Terry?
30:16
No, I don’t.
30:20
He was one of our early cooperators up
30:25
at Bonanza Creek.
30:28
A really sharp ecologist at the University of Alaska.
30:31
Then, he transferred to
30:35
Berkeley.
30:36
Well, it’s a
30:39
20-times more prestigious place than Alaska.
30:44
You can’t blame him for doing it.
30:46
But now, they’ve talked him into coming back, and heading up the LTER.
30:51
Oh, I see.
30:52
And he’s a guy with
30:55
a national, an
31:00
international reputation.
31:00
I was asking Cindy [Miner-PNW Communications Director] to put together
31:03
an epilogue for the Alaska study, which should be coming out pretty soon.
31:07
And one of the things was the closure up there, and the people who’ve left.
31:17
As you can well imagine, I don’t even like
31:22
to think about it.
31:23
Yeah.
31:23
It really pisses me
31:30
off.
31:30
I was talking to Ross, what’s his name?
31:30
I went to see him out at Bend?
31:31
Mitchell, Russ Mitchell.
31:31
Russ Mitchell?
31:32
I went out to see him, and there’s the same kind of feeling at Bend.
31:36
I’d never been out to the Bend Lab, but they closed that down at the same time.
31:41
He’s been out there, and I went out there to meet him at the lab.
31:45
It’s nice and quiet, but it’s like a morgue out
31:50
there, because there’s nobody around.
31:51
That’s stupid.
31:51
Yeah.
31:51
Once you lose a group like that, you don’t just go out and build another.
31:54
We had 12 people!
31:54
We had 12 researchers!
31:54
[In Alaska]
31:54
That’s amazing, because that’s in the ‘80s, you said it
31:55
reached that point, right?
31:55
Yeah!
32:00
So, it’s only about a decade ago.
32:07
I think it’s top leadership.
32:12
When Tarrant was practically [PNW] station director,
32:22
Tarrant and Buckman [Bob] , we had people that believed in Alaska
32:25
research and were behind it.
32:26
I think Ethington [Robert] was, too.
32:26
And now, with what’s his name?
32:27
Philpot?
32:27
[Charles]
32:27
Yeah.
32:27
I don’t think he really
32:31
knew.
32:31
You said something
32:41
about him not liking your manuscript.
32:44
Well, Cindy asked him to write an epilogue.
32:46
I wasn’t real keen on
32:51
that, he said he would.
32:54
Then he read through the manuscript, and said his interpretation would be so
32:59
different from mine, that he didn’t want to write an epilogue, or deal with it.
33:03
So Cindy and Ken [Wright] pulled something together.
33:06
He was not, to
33:16
me at least, he was not specific at all.
33:16
In fact, he would not return my phone calls.
33:17
I tried to talk to him.
33:17
Oh, God, that guy is an arrogant bastard.
33:18
You know, man, oh man!
33:18
He’s part of the reason I retired.
33:21
I just couldn’t stand to deal with that guy.
33:25
I’ve never met him, although he was PNW Station Director at the time
33:28
I was doing the study [Alaska] . I tried several times to contact him
33:32
for an interview, as I wanted to get his view of what happened in Alaska.
33:37
Well, he’s a Johnny-come-lately.
33:38
He doesn’t know what’s going on up there, and never did.
33:40
He wasn’t that interested.
33:43
He didn’t ever return a phone call.
33:46
I never heard back from him.
33:49
[Laughing] Regarding his antipathy, have I ever told you about this story about
33:54
his visiting a project leaders’ meeting?
33:56
No, I
34:00
don’t think so.
34:01
His antipathy dates way back, and I don’t know what the
34:03
genesis of it is, but in about
34:10
1983, something like that, we had a project leaders
34:16
meeting.
34:16
At that time, there was a Missoula Lab [where
34:21
Philpot was stationed] , and he attended our PNW project leaders meeting.
34:25
I forget where it was, Salishan, something
34:32
like that, and he was just an observer sent by Rocky Mountain Station to see how
34:37
PNW conducted project leaders’ meetings.
34:43
As you do at a project leaders’ meeting, you have different things
34:45
to discuss, and one thing on the program was to talk a little bit about
34:52
multifunctional research work units, of which ours was a prime example.
34:57
I
35:02
was given the job to say how we handled it in Fairbanks.
35:04
Made a lot of sense.
35:04
I said how we
35:17
did it and what kind of disciplines we had represented, how
35:24
we all got together and decided how
35:30
to spend the budget, and the cooperation with the people at the university.
35:32
When I got done,
35:35
Charley Philpot stood up, and just ground me up one side and down the other: “Well,
35:45
we would never do that in our station.” I forget what he said. I was so nonplussed,
35:49
I didn’t even know what to say!
35:52
Hmm.
35:52
So, he just blind-sided you?
35:53
Yeah.
35:55
Like he had a vendetta against me, or something.
36:00
Or our unit.
36:01
What were his points?
36:01
I don’t know.
36:01
It was just totally out of the blue.
36:01
Who
36:07
is this guy?
36:09
Where did he get off?
36:11
He’s not even in the Station!
36:13
He’s just an observer!
36:14
Huh.
36:18
He and I just got off on the wrong foot, and I’ve not had any reason to change my
36:26
opinion of him.
36:27
He’s been known to be a burr under a lot of people’s saddles.
36:31
And what he did when he came to PNW Station, he immediately
36:38
re-organized everything.
36:41
He did away with project leaders, and he had guys like Herman [Gucinski, a
36:46
program manager] , who, I’ve got nothing against Herman, he’s a nice guy, quite a
36:50
brilliant guy, but he was trying to run Fairbanks Lab from here [in Oregon] . He’d
36:58
go there twice a year, three times a year, and get into shouting matches with
37:09
Keith.
37:09
Hard to imagine Keith shouting.
37:11
Yeah,
37:14
Keith was upset, as he said that this was a “goddamn carpet bagger.”
37:15
That’s what we used to call these guys that just showed up for
37:20
research in Alaska in the summertime.
37:22
We were the “sourdoughs” and these were the “carpetbaggers.” [Laughs] But,
37:30
with the demise of the project leaders, we just didn’t have any local leadership.
37:36
Everybody was running out and doing their own thing, and you kind of need
37:42
some kind of person who deals with the university [U-Alaska] and the public.
37:47
It’s interesting, because I heard, via the grapevine, that what he didn’t like,
37:54
least of all, was the Fairbanks section.
37:57
Oh, is that right?
37:59
I don’t know who told me that.
38:01
Maybe Martha [Brookes] or somebody.
38:03
Obviously, by the time you get to the end of that, I didn’t actually have it
38:08
closed, in the section I wrote, but I’d shown that the resources were limited.
38:12
Just kind of drained out.
38:14
The handwriting was up on the wall.
38:17
Of course, I didn’t see anything personally that he
38:21
wrote, but Cindy told me.
38:23
The only information she gave me on it, was that he didn’t see that last
38:27
section as being remotely close to how he would view that same situation.
38:31
Obviously, he wanted to tell his own story about the reorganization, but he
38:37
didn’t want to do it for that study.
38:41
For some reason, he just didn’t want to write it.
38:45
Is that right?
38:46
I don’t know, and haven’t talked to him.
38:48
He didn’t really want to tell me his story.
38:50
You never did talk to him?
38:53
No, he never called me back.
38:54
I tried several times, and his wife was there, I talked to her, and she
38:56
said, “I’ll have him call when he gets back.” That was his wife, but
39:01
he sure never returned the phone calls. That’s rude.
39:07
Yeah.
39:08
That’s him.
39:09
Doggone it.
39:10
S.O.B. How did he get to be Station Director, for Pete’s sake?
39:16
I’m always curious about that.
39:17
Who appoints these people, and how do they get their positions?
39:21
We were talking about that in relation to the current director,
39:23
Art and Martha and I. I guess the Chief [USFS] appoints them, you know,
39:29
but how are the recommendations made, and how the decision process
39:32
is conducted, is a little black box.
39:36
The best station director we ever had, and this is a very personal
39:40
viewpoint, and I’ve known him for many years, is Bob Tarrant.
39:45
And he was the only one that didn’t have Washington Office [USFS] experience.
39:50
Is that right?
39:51
He never went back-and-forth.
39:54
Visited lots of times, but was never stationed in
40:01
Washington
40:05
D.C. He took a lot of flack for it, and people told him, “You really need
40:08
that in your career path.” That’s
40:12
what they tell you, because I did the same thing. In my employment, I let
40:19
it be known I wouldn’t consider it.
40:23
I wasn’t with this outfit long before they were nosing around to
40:28
get me back in the Washington Office.
40:31
I just said, “No.”
40:36
Yeah.
40:37
That’s a common thread I’m finding.
40:38
I think it’s really interesting.
40:38
In the Andrews Group here.
40:38
Kerrick, didn’t he hire Steve Eubanks, who not only had University
40:38
of Minnesota connections with him
40:46
[Kerrick] , but
40:48
also, until that time, had never been in the Washington Office?
40:52
Those two people, everyone is telling me, were really crucial to
40:54
the development of the management
40:56
-- Yeah.
40:56
-- science relationship.
40:57
And Bob Tarrant
41:02
was avoiding it, also.
41:02
That’s interesting.
41:02
I hadn’t known that about him before, that he was never in the Washington office.
41:04
Oh, no.
41:05
And Bob, I think he only had a masters.
41:06
Yeah.
41:07
I
41:09
think you’re right about that.
41:10
I talked to him about that last year.
41:11
Is that right?
41:12
Yeah,
41:17
for the Alaska study.
41:18
And I think that’s right.
41:18
He got his masters in soils and started working with SCS [Soil
41:19
Conservation Service] , went in the Army, and came back.
41:29
Of course, Tarrant’s a story-teller.
41:31
I bet you guys really like a guy like Tarrant, because he loves to tell stories.
41:36
He was fun to talk to.
41:38
Oh, he’s a great guy.
41:47
Great guy.
41:49
He reminded me a little bit of Ronald Reagan, the way he’d kind of lean back.
41:49
I can see how he can be real effective.
41:49
He was the kind of guy, when he was [PNW] Director, he’d send
41:52
you notes for your birthday.
41:54
Stuff like that.
41:56
You felt like you had a friend, a good friend.
42:01
He’d come on these inspection tours, we’d just have a great time
42:05
and you wouldn’t feel threatened.
42:08
He was a happy guy and just wanted to be helpful.
42:16
He’d explain what personnel moves were.
42:23
They were trying to get rid of Francis Herman,
42:29
and they thought the way to do it would be to offer him a directed
42:34
reassignment to Fairbanks, you know, send
42:40
him
42:42
to “Siberia.” [Laughing] That he wouldn’t do.
42:42
Everybody who knows Francis Herman, knows he is the most stubborn
42:46
guy on the face of the earth.
42:47
Great guy.
42:48
He’d give you the shirt off his back, but he’s stubborn, and he’s
42:52
not about to be taken advantage of.
42:55
So, Herm called the bluff, and said “I’m going to Fairbanks!”
43:01
Tarrant was telling me one
43:05
day, we had John Zasada in silviculture, and he’s reproduction,
43:13
regeneration-oriented. We need someone else in silviculture, and
43:16
growth-and-yield, to establish permanent plots, and to investigate how trees grow
43:26
long-term.
43:33
Old Tarrant, well, he’s a great guy.
43:36
I’ll be talking to him some more, probably not until December.
43:41
I probably should stop, because you've been talking for a long time.
43:44
It gets kind of wearing after awhile.
43:46
We can talk more in the future.
43:48
Yeah, okay.
43:48
Well.
43:49
I suppose you probably want these back.
43:51
Like I say, when’s this Alaska book [recording ends]
