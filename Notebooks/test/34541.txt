00:34
I’m gonna get started here with a little bit of personal background.
00:40
I understand from talking to Mike Kerrick that you interviewed for the position at
00:43
Blue River [Ranger District – Willamette National Forest] when Jim Caswell retired.
00:47
Maybe you could start off talking about your personal
00:50
background up until that point.
00:55
Okay.
00:56
How much detail?
00:58
Anything you think is relevant.
01:03
I was born and raised in Oregon around the Salem area.
01:08
Spent my early years on a farm, and moved to town when I was in the fifth grade.
01:19
I always liked the out-of-doors.
01:20
I spent time fishing and hunting, and when I
01:26
was thinking about college, I
01:31
had taken the aptitude tests that high school kids
01:37
do, and they basically said you need to do something in the outdoors.
01:41
At that time, I didn’t really have a vision of what I wanted to
01:46
do, but I ended up in forestry.
01:51
Oregon State University had a person who came to my high school to talk about
01:54
forest engineering, and so I said, “That sounds like a pretty neat deal.” Didn’t
01:58
know diddly-squat about forestry at that point. I spent time in the woods, but
02:03
I didn’t know a thing about forestry.
02:05
I ended up in the forestry program and graduated from Oregon State
02:11
as a forest engineer in 1970.
02:17
I went to work for the Forest Service, because by that time, I had worked
02:22
three summers with the Forest Service.
02:25
I knew that’s kind of where I wanted to work after school.
02:30
What was unusual, in going to Oregon State University in those days, was that
02:36
it was kind of the production forestry school.
02:41
To some extent I took a fair amount of grief from classmates whose
02:48
ultimate goal coming out of Oregon State University in forest
02:51
engineering, was going to work for McMillen and O’Dell in Canada.
02:56
If you really had aspirations to go into forest engineering, that’s what
02:59
you should be driving for, because that is production forestry at its best.
03:03
You plan roads and logging and that kind of thing in Canada.
03:09
Of course, there were other companies in the U.S. that were next in line,
03:14
but the Forest Service was not thought of as, I don’t think as a
03:18
paramount profession in those days.
03:23
But when I went to work for the Forest Service as a summer worker, I
03:28
thought, “Gee, this is a good place to work, because there was concern about
03:33
forestry, and there were good people.”
03:37
There was a hint at that time that the Forest Service was not fully production
03:42
forestry. I think, even at that point, I was sort of headed in that direction.
03:47
My first job in the Forest Service was working in the supervisor’s office
03:51
in the Mt. Hood [National] Forest.
03:53
I got to know
03:58
the non-forestry specialists, as well as forestry, everyone; the hydrologist, the
04:02
fish biologist, the wildlife biologist, the landscape architects, and those
04:09
sorts of non-traditional viewpoints.
04:13
Where were you?
04:13
This was in the Mt. Hood National Forest headquarters in Portland.
04:22
I was given the opportunity
04:28
to learn about some of those particular viewpoints on how to
04:32
do things in a sensitive way.
04:33
I think that had an impression on me.
04:36
From there I moved to a planning position on the Estacada District [Mt.
04:43
Hood NF] . Because of my work with those folks, I had been involved in a lot of
04:49
the planning activities on the district.
04:54
I think the planning I did at that time
04:57
was not necessarily cutting-edge, but certainly more toward the non-traditional
05:03
approaches in timber sales.
05:06
We were still getting timber sales done.
05:08
We were
05:11
just doing it a little bit different way.
05:14
I was very grateful for the help those people gave.
05:17
It was a relationship that just sort of fit.
05:23
I wonder about the traditional vs.
05:27
non-traditional issue [timber planning/harvesting]
05:29
. Just different kinds of logging systems that protected the ground better.
05:37
The skyline sales were non-traditional at that
05:46
timfe.
05:46
I tended to think toward the balloon sales, helicopter sales end of the scale
05:50
a little bit, rather than the norm.
05:52
We
05:58
planned protection of riparian areas and streams, even wildlife
06:04
trees, visual management, and some
06:10
blending of the sales.
06:12
It wasn’t that we were doing anything necessarily cutting-edge.
06:15
We
06:17
pushed towards the end, but it was just the fact that that
06:21
sort of stuff just made sense.
06:23
And we
06:27
butted heads with anybody.
06:28
I mean we were bringing folks along with us as we went.
06:31
It just sort of made sense.
06:35
From there I moved to Wenatchee National Forest as a timber management assistant
06:38
on a district, and that’s where
06:44
serendipity sort of struck.
06:49
I moved there in 1975.
06:50
I think it was 1977 when a couple of folks on the district had gone
06:56
to a session in Wenatchee where Chris Maser made a presentation.
07:00
At that point Chris was working for the BLM out in eastern Oregon.
07:03
The Forest had asked him to come up talk about some things.
07:07
We were in the midst of having discussions and in the midst of a
07:14
dilemma about how we were going to handle management in the large basin
07:17
right around the ranger station.
07:19
A couple of technicians that came back from that session were very impressed
07:22
with Chris and what he had to say on sort of non-traditional viewpoints
07:25
of managing the forest ecosystem.
07:28
We had said, “Well, we need to get a team together to talk about how we are
07:33
going to do the pre-commercial thinning and harvesting in this basin.” And
07:37
folks said, “Well, gee, you ought to try and get Chris here,” and we did.
07:41
Chris came and spent a week on the district as part of a
07:44
small team that we put together with the forest silviculturist
07:49
and a couple other people on district, including the silviculturist
07:52
and the forest soil scientists.
07:59
At that point, things just clicked.
08:05
We were just sort of on the same wave length with what Chris had to say.
08:07
That was the beginning of a long-term friendship with Chris that
08:14
influenced a lot of my thinking.
08:18
We came up with some very non-traditional approaches on how to
08:21
handle everything from coarse woody debris to what kind of harvests that
08:26
we were going to do in this basin.
08:33
At that point I started approaching all other projects on the district
08:38
through a revised management system.
08:40
We, the timber staff, were responsible for doing the major planning, so we
08:45
started building-in lots of things about coarse woody debris and wildlife
08:48
trees and fuel breaks and slash treatments and that kind of thing.
08:55
From there I went to a district ranger position on the Bear Springs
08:58
District of the Mount Hood National Forest, and we had a very good
09:03
silviculturist named Lloyd Mercer,
09:08
who shared interests in the different approaches, and
09:14
also he was real big into prescribed fire.
09:19
Lloyd and I had done a lot of looking at non-traditional approaches.
09:27
But, after being there a short time, it became apparent that we were still
09:29
doing a lot of cleanup of slash and doing things in a traditional way.
09:35
What we did was ask Chris Maser, Jim Trappe, and a couple other folks to come
09:42
and spend a couple days with us, and talk about how we were treating slash and
09:48
looking at timber harvest.
09:50
They spent a couple of days on the district and we ended up developing
09:54
some guidelines on how to handle slash treatment, and furthering
10:02
the relationship with Chris.
10:05
It
10:22
was really a neat exercise and the Bear Springs District sort of began
10:28
implementing some very non-traditional approaches to things, leaving large
10:35
amounts of coarse woody debris, and we were leaving lots of reserve trees.
10:41
We had a silviculturist and a fire management officer who were very receptive
10:48
to these practices, in fact, were not just receptive, but were promoting them.
10:52
We were doing prescribed burning and under-burnings.
10:57
We were even doing prescribed burning in pine plantations.
11:02
Very, very non-traditional approaches, and we took a certain amount of heat
11:09
from some of the staff officers on the forest, but on the other hand, we were
11:14
also getting lots of kudos for the things we were doing in non-traditional ways.
11:18
We were starting to look at managing forest
11:23
ecosystems and that was sort of the next step in the evolution.
11:29
At that point the region [Region] had a competition for a district-of-the-year
11:30
award, and for several years
11:35
in a row, Bear Springs was declared the winner of this regional competition,
11:41
because of all the non-traditional work that we were doing in ecosystem
11:47
management.
11:47
That brings us up to the time when I was selected as the ranger at Blue River.
11:54
I think what kind of kicked it over the edge for my selection,
11:58
was that Mike Kerrick called me and personally talked to me on the phone.
12:02
He asked how I felt about working with researchers and scientists, and I was able
12:06
to say, I’ve already got a really good relationship with some researchers and
12:10
scientists, and I think it’s really neat.
12:11
I think that was probably the “extra credit” that got me the job at Blue River.
12:18
At that point I
12:23
knew that I had an interest in working with scientists, but I had no idea what
12:26
the extent of the possible universe was when I moved to Blue River.
12:32
And I remember, I got the job just at the time there was a unit
12:37
leaders conference going on in Bend.
12:40
Jim Caswell [Blue River District Head Ranger] and I spent probably a couple
12:42
hours just walking around the resort area where this conference is being
12:48
held, and he was kind of filling me in on what was going on at Blue River.
12:52
It was like a mini-transition.
12:54
And he was trying to explain to me how this relationship with the
12:58
researchers worked on the Andrews.
13:04
We always kind of characterize things in models we can understand,
13:09
so you try to explain this, the
13:13
organizational charter, if you will.
13:15
Who reports to whom, and who has got what responsibility and that kind of thing.
13:20
I couldn’t grasp it.
13:21
He was trying to explain some basic things and it just didn’t, you know,
13:24
just didn’t fit too well together, but I thought, “Well, I’ll pick that up.”
13:30
It was interesting, but after spending a little over four years on the
13:35
Blue River District, and even now, I could never explain how all of this
13:42
works.
13:42
I mean,
13:45
there’s this unique relationship, very ambiguous;
13:52
how all things are tied together.
13:53
Certainly there is a memorandum of understanding that says that the
13:59
National Forest Service and Oregon State University will be working together;
14:03
I can understand that part of it.
14:05
But how, who reports to whom, and who has what responsibility, and all that
14:10
kind of stuff; all the lines are blurred.
14:12
Because Oregon State researchers and Forest Service researchers are
14:15
working closely together, and in some things they are tied directly together
14:19
because of the grant proposals they had submitted that funded certain people.
14:26
But, there were no direct lines of authority that say, this
14:30
person works for that person.
14:31
I mean there were in some cases, but in many cases, there were
14:36
people that crossed lines of organization and that kind of stuff.
14:40
I always characterized it as a situation of not always knowing who has
14:43
responsibility for the H. J. Andrews.
14:47
I had some responsibilities as district manager, Art [McKee] had some
14:50
responsibilities, Jerry Franklin and Fred Swanson had some responsibilities.
14:57
Art probably had the most direct responsibilities on the research
14:59
side because he was the site manager.
15:02
And I always characterized it as if, Art and I really wanted to get into pissing
15:07
matches, we could have, because our responsibilities overlapped so much in
15:12
terms of who was suppose to get what done.
15:15
But we never did, and that’s because we sort were all working together on a common
15:22
vision, in that we were trying to work together to improve resource management.
15:27
We didn’t let the small stuff get in our way.
15:29
That is how all of those people [HJA] work in research.
15:33
Yes, they had disagreements from time-to-time, and there were friction
15:35
points, particularly when it came time for a chapter to be due or a grant application
15:41
to be made, but it was never a fatal thing, because we all had a greater vision
15:46
that we were working towards something.
15:48
That’s how things sort of things worked.
15:50
I got off track from the background, but that
15:53
that brings us up to the 1984 time-line.
15:56
Good.
15:57
Had you met Jim Caswell before that conference in Bend?
16:01
I had, but I did not know him well.
16:06
Well, I knew him reasonably well.
16:07
He and I had gone to an intensive semester program together,
16:12
so I had some background with him.
16:18
Need some simple clarification things from earlier.
16:18
Let us back up a little bit here.
16:22
At Oregon State University, and through your career, are there any
16:27
people you would identify as being particular mentors or role models?
16:32
You mentioned Chris Maser as someone you worked with, but you
16:35
were more of a peer, I gather.
16:37
Well, there were a number of people, I wouldn’t necessarily call mentors,
16:43
but they were people who certainly
16:47
influenced my resource thinking.
16:50
Fisheries biologist Chuck Witt and engineering geologist Pete Patterson.
16:58
There
17:00
were just so many people in the specialty arenas that I worked
17:07
with, almost everybody that I came across, I almost hesitate to mention names because
17:10
it is just sort of a continual process.
17:15
The deputy forest supervisor on the Wenatchee Forest was Dick [name
17:19
unintelligible] . Dick was always someone, even after I moved to Washington DC,
17:23
somebody I maintained contact with, and who was certainly a supporter of mine.
17:28
He was to some extent a mentor with very non-traditional views on resource
17:35
management, that certainly had an influence on me, basically in terms of
17:42
his non-traditional outlooks, which established in me that it is
17:48
okay to be that way, because he was in a leadership position.
17:53
The Wenatchee Forest had quite a few non-traditional people.
17:58
Randy Perkins was the
18:06
timber staff officer, and he had a non-traditional view point for a
18:06
timber staff officer on a forest level.
18:23
You know, there are lots and lots of people like that [with non-traditional
18:27
leanings] . Kirk Horn was another person, a wildlife biologist on the
18:31
Mount Hood Forest for a while, and then he was in the regional office, and
18:37
he had some non-traditional viewpoints, very strong viewpoints.
18:41
And
18:44
I spent time talking with him about things and concerns.
18:49
I’m
18:53
trying to think of other people,
18:56
names that come to mind.
18:57
Chris Maser is by far the strongest, since that
19:01
very first meeting
19:05
and particularly the
19:08
first spring in the Blue River, I had frequent contact with Chris
19:11
as well as the Andrews group.
19:13
Chris wasn’t a regular participant in the Andrews group, but he
19:17
was always in the periphery.
19:19
But with me, I was always in direct contract with him and so he sort
19:23
of became part of the Andrews group
19:27
with me.
19:29
Another question I had here for quick clarification.
19:32
Who
19:34
was forest supervisor there at Mt. Hood at the time?
19:38
Actually, when I first started, it was Dale Robertson, and he was the
19:41
one who selected me for the job, but he left almost immediately,
19:43
and it was Dick Pfils after that.
19:45
Dick Pfils?
19:48
Pfils.
19:48
P-F-I-L-S.
19:55
That was an interesting thing because
20:02
we were pretty much given license.
20:05
At that point,
20:10
the districts had a lot of autonomy, and we were off doing our thing pretty much.
20:16
It wasn’t so much direct support, but it wasn’t non-support, which is important.
20:24
I mean, basically, we were given a fair amount of freedom.
20:29
We were meeting targets and getting stuff done at the same time, and so
20:32
we were pretty much got left alone.
20:34
You
20:36
were talking a little bit about your decision to take
20:39
the position at Blue River.
20:41
At that point in your career, what were your career goals?
20:45
What were you anticipating coming out of that decision?
20:49
This was a lateral move.
20:50
I was a GS-12 ranger at Bear Springs and a GS-13 ranger at
20:56
Blue River, so it was a promotion.
20:58
At
21:02
that point,
21:06
I was still enjoying the job as district ranger, had given some thought to
21:10
the fact that someday I might want to try for a forest supervisor job.
21:14
But that was really not the reason.
21:15
I mean, it was another district, and was a district that looked good in terms of
21:24
having interesting challenges, but I didn’t go beyond that point.
21:28
I had not thought all about a grand vision of a partnership with research,
21:33
but saw the opportunity to work with research and thought that was neat.
21:43
I thought it was neat to work with them, and I had always enjoyed
21:45
working with the research folks that I had worked with, but I didn’t
21:51
have this grand vision that it was going to get to the point where things got
21:56
so out-of-hand.
21:58
You talked a little bit about the phone interview with Mike Kerrick.
22:01
Was that the extent of your interview process?
22:05
Yes, that was, and I bet it wasn’t five minutes.
22:09
They had already done a lot of screening of candidates at that point, and
22:11
they knew who the candidates were.
22:17
I got the impression Mike had narrowed it down and he was just trying
22:22
to see whether they made the best choice.
22:24
I know the research folks had probably approached him and said they would like
22:30
somebody who is going to work with us, and I think that was probably what he was
22:34
following up on, from that perspective.
22:36
I never really talked to him about that
22:40
after they offered the job and it worked out.
22:45
It was a very, very short interview process, and I’m sure they had done
22:48
a lot of screening before that.
22:51
He made the same comments about the reason why he went with you, being familiar
22:56
and wanting to work with researchers.
22:59
Maybe you could talk a little about your first impressions once you started.
23:05
Before that, did you have any previous understanding, and what
23:09
was your level of previous awareness of the kind of work being done
23:12
down at the Andrews at that time?
23:14
Sketchy.
23:17
I had in my career seen research papers, that kind of thing, and I
23:20
knew where the Andrews was, basically.
23:20
I knew it was
23:37
an experimental forest, but at that point I didn’t know that much about it.
23:39
I couldn’t tell you what it was, and I wouldn’t have been able to explain
23:39
exactly what the role of an experimental forest was, that there are separate
23:39
areas, administrators, designated experiments and that kind of stuff.
23:43
Mostly, I just had seen the name H.J. Andrews.
23:47
You hadn’t worked with any experimental forests up until that point?
23:54
No, not until this point.
23:55
And the scientists that you had been involved with earlier, had they been
23:56
locally connected with the region or were they from research grants?
23:59
Well, a little bit of both, as we had
24:08
Jim Trappe.
24:12
I’m trying to remember whether he, I think he was PNW at the
24:14
time, but he came to Bear Springs.
24:17
By the time Chris [Maser] came to Bear Springs, he [Jim] had moved to
24:20
Corvallis, and that’s where he and Jim would work on the connections between
24:29
truffles and
24:34
tree survival and those kinds of things, and the mycorrhizae connection
24:39
with rodents, all kinds of research.
24:42
I think most of them were at Corvallis together.
24:42
But that was kind of
24:53
the extent of it.
24:53
You know, I obviously knew them [HJA scientists] , a fair amount
24:56
about Jerry Franklin and his work.
24:58
We had referenced his work when I was up on the Wenatchee, and all of those folks
25:04
were people that we were aware of, but
25:10
not in-depth.
25:13
Maybe you could talk about what your first impressions were, and the
25:16
conditions in the district when you came, including at the Andrews and in
25:21
general terms of the Blue River District,
25:28
when you first came in.
25:31
I can talk about it, because very shortly after arriving at Blue
25:37
River -- I moved there in October of ‘84 and spring of ’85 -- we had our
25:43
first session with the research folks.
25:48
One of the reasons was that shortly after my arrival, having come from Bear
25:53
Springs, we were working with coarse woody debris and those kinds of issues.
25:57
I got to Blue River and had very good people working there.
26:01
I mean, Blue River was a good team of people,
26:06
had a good silviculturist, Jim Golden, good fire management officer,
26:18
and Chuck Anderson was the resource assistant; good people.
26:25
Timber management was led by another first-rate person.
26:29
A real good team of people.
26:35
One of the things immediately apparent was that we were still
26:39
in high production forestry.
26:42
Even with the Andrews next door, there had been interactions
26:45
with the research folk and
26:48
fairly good relationship with them, more than fairly good,
26:54
as it was a good partnership.
26:56
Jim Caswell had promoted that.
27:01
But in terms of what was actually being applied on the ground, it
27:05
was still production forestry.
27:06
We were still yarding all unmerchantable material and the units were cleaned, and
27:12
the issue of leaving coarse woody debris in the units had not been addressed.
27:16
The silviculturist, Jim Golden, took responsibility for calling
27:24
a meeting in the spring.
27:26
That meeting with some of the same folks mentioned earlier, Chris Maser,
27:31
Art McKee, the soils people, and I think Fred Swanson, were there.
27:36
I can’t remember all of the players, but it was a fairly large group
27:40
compared to what we had at Bear Springs.
27:43
We invited them to come and spend a little over a day, sort of the same
27:49
process we had used at Bear Springs.
27:51
What we basically did say was, “Okay, let’s go out and take a look at what
27:55
we are doing now and let’s have some dialogue about what the potential
28:01
implications are, and then let’s figure out what we ought to be doing instead.”
28:07
This was particularly focused on treatment of coarse woody debris
28:12
at that point.
28:13
That was the specific focus, because that seemed to be the biggest impact.
28:16
In talking with Chris Maser for some time, we really knew what
28:23
the implications were and the potential tremendous benefit of coarse woody debris.
28:31
Big logs are basically what we are talking about.
28:35
In terms of the process, we spent a day in the field,
28:40
and when we got back to the office,
28:45
what I said was, “What we need here in the district is to develop some kind of
28:50
a rough guideline that will tell us how much material we ought to be leaving
28:56
rather than how much we ought to take.” Because all slash guidelines up to that
29:01
point in time were based on fire hazard, they said, “You should leave no more than
29:08
such and such.” And we said, “Instead of talking about how much we should
29:13
take away from the site, we want to talk about how much gets left on the site.
29:19
How much do we need out there for certain purposes?” There was
29:25
naturally a certain amount of reluctance on the part of the scientists and
29:30
specialists to commit to something like that which is going to be in writing,
29:34
and says, “This is it because we are basing this on intuitive knowledge.” We
29:40
had a discussion about that, and I said, “We understand that we are putting you
29:43
on the spot, we understand that this
29:46
is going to be based on intuitive knowledge.
29:48
But we also are telling you that you are not going to leave this room until
29:51
we end up with something on that.” And I literally said that with a smile.
29:54
I said, “We are not going to let you leave until we have something here
29:57
on flow charts that we can use, and make into a guideline.” We chuckled
30:01
about that, but I said, “I’m serious, you’re not leaving until we get this
30:05
thing down.” [Chuckle] And we did that.
30:08
We tried to create an environment where we said, “It’s okay. We are not going
30:11
to quote anybody as saying this is the absolute kind of thing.” But I said,
30:15
“Your intuitive knowledge is better than our intuitive knowledge in terms
30:18
of the scientific ramifications or implications of coarse woody debris.
30:26
We’ve got folks here who can talk about the fire hazard aspects, and you guys
30:30
can talk about the ecological aspects, and all of our knowledge together, we
30:33
should come up with something that we can at least live with.” We developed
30:37
in that period of time a very rough
30:43
framework of how we should be managing coarse woody debris.
30:46
And that became our coarse woody debris guidelines for the district that
30:49
involved into, actually several years later as I understand it, the framework
30:55
for standards and guidelines in the Willamette [National] Forest Plan.
31:01
But we took a totally different approach than the rest of the forests, and
31:06
we were leaving massive tonnages of coarse woody debris out on the ground.
31:10
And
31:12
by doing that we were saving a lot of money because we were not paying the
31:16
logger to bring all of this material up to a landing, where we would burn it.
31:20
So,
31:22
we would save money on the logging costs, we would save money in not
31:23
having to burn up the land, plus the fact that it was out on the ground
31:27
and was a benefit to the resource.
31:29
We still burned the unit, but they didn’t end up looking like the carpet in this
31:32
room, free of material, lots of logs up there, and we did enough analysis to know
31:38
that it was not going to be a long term fire hazard and all those kinds of things.
31:42
We did an analysis of that, and I’m sure you’ve seen the book on
31:46
the different classes of logs; classes one, two, three, four, five.
31:49
You know, the guidelines addressed how much of which class should
31:52
be out there and what kind of distribution and that kind of stuff.
31:57
That was again the first step in the evolution
32:07
from production forestry into
32:13
more of an ecological approach.
32:15
And overall, it took several years to see results from the evolution, but
32:21
from my perspective, it was very quick.
32:22
We were able to see the results immediately.
32:25
We had a sale administrator, Bob Flint, who
32:32
was more than receptive.
32:34
He was very innovative in his approaches to getting these
32:37
things done on the ground.
32:40
He embraced these new guidelines that we developed to the extent
32:46
where he was implementing, even
32:50
on old contracts that required yarding and moving.
32:53
He went back and implemented them on old contracts.
32:55
Otherwise there would’ve been this waiting period of four or five years
33:00
before we saw things on the ground.
33:02
We were seeing them immediately.
33:04
Not on every sale, but immediately on a lot of sales, because of the
33:09
process of updating old contracts.
33:11
And all of our new contracts were updated as they came on-line.
33:15
But, he was a real key individual in getting results implemented on the
33:26
ground.
33:26
And of course,
33:29
the timber sales assistant was very receptive to it as was our staff.
33:33
They basically they embraced thisd and we sort of had a transition in the
33:39
district, people were receptive when we did it, and we started implementing it.
33:46
Did you get the impression that at that time the Blue River District
33:49
was behind, about the same as, or ahead of other districts?
33:53
When we began, I think we were probably sort of average in terms of the actual on-
33:59
the-ground results outside the Andrews.
34:02
On the Andrews, I think things were being done a little bit differently.
34:06
We began implementing on all acreage, and at that point we were an anomaly,
34:16
not only on the forest [Will.
34:18
N.F.] , but in the region.
34:19
We became an instant anomaly because of all of these things we were
34:23
doing, and the more we worked, the more anomalous we became.
34:31
What was their reaction?
34:35
It varied.
34:37
One of the things that
34:41
we had as a philosophy on the district, was that we did not go out of our way
34:48
to try and
34:52
preach or toot our own horns.
34:55
I mean, we tried to let people know what was going on, but our real philosophy in
35:02
working with the researchers, and I think their philosophy also, was we will lead by
35:05
example, and we will keep people tuned in, but we are not trying to be evangelists.
35:12
I mean we were trying to make sure what we were doing was working, and
35:16
we were focusing on that aspect.
35:18
To make sure that happened, we were always asking ourselves questions of how can we
35:24
do this better, differently and that kind of thing, to make sure it is working.
35:35
We had lots of opportunities for tours and inviting people to come to
35:38
the forests and that kind of thing.
35:39
And as the word spread we had people calling up, leadership teams from
35:44
other forests who would call up and say, “Hey, can we come and bring our
35:47
leadership team down and take a tour of what you guys are doing down there?”
35:53
So, we would work with district folks and research folks to take people on these
35:57
tours. That’s how we spread the word.
36:03
I mean, we weren’t trying to put articles in the paper that said
36:05
what a good job we were doing.
36:06
We were trying to sort of transfer technology in groups, and we did it
36:14
at conferences and that kind of thing.
36:16
But it wasn’t, again we’re not trying to be evangelists, necessarily, so from
36:23
that standpoint, it was more subtle.
36:25
I think, a little more subtle.
36:26
So concerning
36:30
people in the general public, was there much interest in that regard?
36:37
Well, that began to build.
36:39
As the word got out we were doing things differently, through different means
36:46
we would have contacts with people from the environmental community,
36:51
different groups or whomever.
36:52
We
36:56
would sponsor tours, small seminars, and get different people together, would
37:05
get those started and
37:08
it sort of spread by word-of-mouth that things were going on
37:11
here that were different.
37:15
And so we would tell them what we were doing and why.
37:19
We had trips with the Silviculture Institute [training program put on
37:24
jointly by USFS and OSU] , people who were going through that formal training
37:25
program, the classes would come to Andrews, and we would go up and talk.
37:30
For different training sessions people would come, and frankly,
37:36
not everyone was receptive or impressed with what we were doing.
37:41
We often got flack from people who were very skeptical about what we were doing.
37:46
But we told them what we were doing and why.
37:48
And there wasn’t any doubt in my mind that what we were doing was right.
37:53
And I don’t think that there was any doubt in the minds of the research folk, that
37:56
we were headed in the right direction.
37:58
But not everybody shared that perspective.
38:00
How would you characterize the reaction of people in Blue River?
38:03
In the district?
38:04
No, I mean in the town.
38:05
Oh, in the town.
38:06
Local residents.
38:07
Hmm.
38:09
Were they even aware of it?
38:10
To some extent the folks were aware, just from our conversations, and we
38:17
actually had some tours for local
38:22
people, power-brokers within the community, folks from the school
38:28
and the county, that kind of thing.
38:29
We would have tours for them and show them what was going on.
38:34
But, if
38:38
you took a casual poll amongst the local residents, most people wouldn’t have known
38:44
that there was anything dramatic going on.
38:47
I mean, when they were out in the woods, they probably would have seen some
38:48
changes occur, but that was the extent.
38:52
I didn’t get a lot of reaction.
38:55
If I’m not mistaken, that was a critical period in the local economy, ‘84-’85.
39:02
What would you characterize as the leading concern about the district at
39:06
that time for people in that region?
39:11
Well, all during that period, we were still pumping out timber sales.
39:16
I mean, we were still meeting the allowable cut.
39:19
So there wasn’t any concern from the economic status that somehow
39:22
we were shutting off timber sales.
39:26
That certainly wasn’t an issue.
39:27
So, from the industry side, there wasn’t any concern about the amount of volume.
39:30
There was a concern from the industry side, that we can talk about at some
39:33
point, about what we were doing and
39:38
different aspects.
39:40
From the environmental side, there were a number of groups and individuals
39:45
in the area that were active.
39:49
Some of those folks, I think, were very receptive to what we were doing.
39:54
We had a couple of critics that basically didn’t want to see any
39:57
timber harvest going on at all, and so, regardless of whether we were
40:01
doing things in a different, more ecologically sensitive way, that
40:06
didn’t make any difference to them.
40:08
Basically, they were going to be critics regardless of how we approached it
40:11
as long as we were harvesting timber.
40:11
We understood that as to whether or
40:15
not we agreed, we just knew that was their perspective.
40:21
We were able to take some of the environmental groups from the Eugene
40:24
area, from the McKenzie drainage, out on the ground, show them what we
40:29
were doing, and again talk about why.
40:32
And I believe that they were again, they may not have been liked there being timber
40:37
harvest, but they were supportive that
40:42
we were doing it in a way that was probably better than production forestry.
40:47
If
40:49
you could make the jump that there were going to be timber
40:51
harvests, they were supportive that it was being done in this way.
40:55
But not all of them made the jump that there ought to be timber harvest.
40:59
I understand that.
41:02
Shifting gears here a little bit, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about
41:04
your perception of the physical layout of the Andrews Forest when you arrived.
41:10
Did this place strike you as different or unusual than any
41:13
place you’ve been in that regard?
41:15
Physical layout in what sense?
41:17
I’m talking about the road system that was in place, and the way it had been managed
41:21
as an experimental forest until that time.
41:26
Since you hadn’t really dealt with an experimental forest previously, and
41:29
here’s your first experience, was there anything that really struck you about it?
41:38
Well, the road system was, for the area, sort of typical.
41:43
I
41:46
don’t think there was anything dramatically unusual.
41:48
I mean, there were different kinds of experiments going on, the very
41:54
early harvesting in the area was interesting, the fact that it had
41:57
been done with the European sky crane [Wyssen] , and there was an interesting
42:03
sort of historical aspect to that.
42:03
Proportionately, I think there has been less harvested in the Andrews
42:03
than typically on the landscape.
42:03
That is just something that I suspected because
42:16
of it being an experimental forest,
42:27
but I don’t know if there was
42:30
anything that stood out, other than there were special places for forest
42:34
research and other interesting aspects.
42:37
Lookout Creek and some of the studies that had been done there, looking at
42:44
the amount of coarse woody debris in the stream, the intensive mass and
43:00
that kind of thing.
43:03
Maybe you could tell me who you would identify as key players at
43:06
the Andrews when you were there, from ‘84 to ’89, a five-year period.
43:11
Well, four-and-a-half, a little over four years.
43:12
I left in January of ‘89.
43:15
I know it’s usually impossible to do this, but could you list three people that
43:19
were your closest colleagues during that period of time who would you identify?
43:23
Fred Swanson, Art McKee,
43:28
in terms of the Andrews itself, and
43:35
probably Tom Spies and Chris Maser.
43:38
It would be tough to narrow
43:43
it down.
43:43
Early on it was Jerry Franklin, but you know, Jerry left sort of in the middle of
43:49
that period, but I dealt a lot with Jerry in the first years I was on the district.
43:55
He was the visible leader, if
44:01
you will, of the Andrews group.
44:06
It was pretty apparent that he was, and that folks looked up to him as being
44:13
the leader/coordinator/facilitator.
44:16
And I think my perception is that he was a big reason why all of
44:24
that had come together, initially.
44:27
I
44:29
don’t know, and I’m sure you’re getting a perspective from all of the work you’ve
44:33
done how unusual the Andrews group is.
44:41
Having all of those people come together in that kind of a forum, is a very
44:45
unusual situation across country.
44:48
I mean it just,
44:51
using it as kind of a model here, trying to get something similar established.
44:56
You have to have that peculiar combination, unique combination
45:02
of personalities, chemistry, commitment, vision, that kind of
45:07
stuff, and people working together.
45:09
Certainly everybody else that came together, there was a critical aspect of
45:12
that but it had to be somebody who was a catalyst, and I think probably Jerry
45:15
was that from the way I understand it.
45:18
When he left, Fred Swanson really took that role, Fred and
45:25
Art together kind of took that leadership role, Fred probably more
45:31
dominant because of his role in the PNW.
45:36
Those are the folks that I think I would identify with the most.
45:39
Another person,
45:45
I was trying to think,
45:48
Stan Gregory is certainly somebody I worked with a lot,
45:55
particularly in the water area.
45:57
You couldn’t leave him out of the formula.
46:00
We worked on some unusual projects together.
46:05
Just a lot of them, and I almost hate to mention names because there
46:11
is so many people.
46:14
Yeah, it’s a tough question and it’s almost impossible to
46:19
answer.
46:19
Art was the person I worked with
46:23
the most frequently, and the most intensively on issues related to
46:28
the Andrews physical location, because we were always working
46:34
on things like road maintenance, sizing, and those kinds of issues.
46:40
Fred was somebody that I worked with a lot in terms of coordinating
46:45
the general Andrews operation, and then of course, when we got down
46:50
to specific projects, we worked intensively with all kinds of people.
46:54
Mark Harmon, on the log decomp study, but if you look at
47:00
the two people that were really sort of the top of the list in terms of Andrews
47:05
activities, it would be Fred and Art.
47:06
And then, I
47:10
still work a lot with Chris Maser in terms of just general philosophy stuff
47:17
in ecosystem management, and Tom Spies.
47:19
I’m curious about the earlier comment on trying to replicate the Andrews.
47:22
I wanted to talk to you later about that, and we’ll get back to that.
47:29
I’m interested in your insights on what made the Andrews tick, what elements were
47:34
you trying to bring in there, that maybe better to get a little more background.
47:42
Maybe you could tell me, I think you mentioned this briefly, how
47:47
would you characterize the degree of interaction among scientists
47:50
in the district when you arrived?
47:51
You referred to this in general terms earlier, but more specifically now?
49:05
Again,
49:52
I characterize it as cordial, mutual respect, I
50:03
picked up to some extent the folks considered for projects on the Andrews.
50:10
The district was responsible for implementing manipulation, like timber
50:15
sales or whatever on the Andrews, but I think there was still to some extent the
50:19
consideration that it was imposition.
50:24
There was not a full integration between the district and the research community.
50:29
I think Jim [Caswell] had been a good supporter, but it didn’t necessarily
50:34
become fully institutionalized.
50:35
And certainly, the information that was coming from [research on] the Andrews
50:42
was not being fully implemented on the district, as the Andrews was still
50:46
considered, here’s another operation over here, and we’ve got our district and
50:50
we’re going to operate as usual on the district, and over there on the Andrews,
51:00
is different.
51:01
But Jim [Caswell] , I think made inroads in terms of good relationships
51:05
with the research community.
51:09
You mentioned one criteria when you were hired, that [Kerrick] pointed out
51:14
on the phone, that you were to develop a relationship with the researchers.
51:17
Was that an expected goal?
51:18
Well, I don’t know that he really said that.
51:20
I think what he asked was, “how do you feel about working with
51:24
research folk,” etc., and I think I
51:31
told him that we [previous team] had been working with research
51:33
and I considered it, a real unique opportunity, that kind of thing.
51:40
Must have done the trick.
51:41
I was just telling him what I believed, and it worked.
51:46
I think you’ve talked about some of these already.
51:55
If I read you right when you were talking earlier, one leading management
51:58
problems you were concerned about was the coarse, woody debris issue.
52:02
Were there other major concerns or issues at the time?
52:08
That was the one that probably jumped out first, just based on the
52:13
experience we had had at Bear Springs
52:16
in working with coarse woody debris.
52:17
But the other one was wildlife trees, and live trees.
52:26
I will tell you a little anecdote, and it needs to be the complete one so
52:30
you understand sort of the evolution.
52:32
When first on the district and driving around with some folks, might have been a
52:43
couple of assistant managers, we were looking at the harvesting yields and
52:46
management on the district, and one of the things I commented about on
52:50
the harvesting was that there are no wildlife trees and they were doing
52:54
basically traditional clearcutting.
52:56
I said, “I’m not used to that,” and talked about what we were doing at
53:01
Bear Springs, and there were places where we were leaving lots of trees.
53:06
For the most part, green tall trees, in some areas we had a lot of green
53:10
tall trees, snags, and dead trees too.
53:16
I can remember one of the statements that someone made, “Well, geez, the
53:19
forest supervisor was out one time and we were looking at the unit where we
53:25
had a couple of wildlife trees left, and he made the comment that the only good
53:28
wildlife tree is one that is going down the road on a truck.” I thought, “That
53:32
is interesting,” and filed that one away, as sort of an interesting story.
53:36
But that was basically, the general philosophy on the district.
53:43
There isn’t any support for wildlife trees and they aren’t going to leave them.
53:47
Well, I need to add the other end of that, is
53:53
that I always had a great respect for Mike Kerrick.
53:57
I think he was a good forest supervisor, and I had a lot of respect for Mike as
54:02
forest supervisor, and he gave us lots and lots of freedom, even though I know
54:07
he had a certain amount of discomfort the first few years we were there and some
54:11
of the things that we were branching off on, some personal discomfort in terms
54:15
of his understanding and philosophy.
54:21
But one thing that I have the greatest respect for Mike is his willingness
54:27
to consider things, and to change where there was better information.
54:33
Art McKee told me a story about a
54:39
year after I had left.
54:41
They had a tour, and I can’t remember who all was on the tour, but Mike was
54:47
there representing the forest, and as they were talking about some things, Mike
54:53
got up on a stump and started extolling the virtues of ecosystem management
54:58
and the benefits, and talking about coarse woody debris, wildlife trees,
55:00
the effects of fragmentation and all kinds of things he had been working on.
55:05
He said he just stood there open-mouthed at how articulate Mike was on
55:13
the aspects that we had been working on and how supportive he was.
55:16
Because he had made within about a five year period, almost a complete transition.
55:25
And he was not doing it because it was the chic thing to do, he was
55:28
doing it because he believed it.
55:32
I mean, he was sincere.
55:33
Lots of people tend to make seeming transitions and mouth the words because
55:38
it’s the “in-thing” to do, but Mike was doing it because he believed it.
55:44
So I wanted to finish that anecdote,
55:49
but wildlife trees was another aspect.
55:53
Basically what happened after we got coarse woody debris guidelines, we started
55:58
working on wildlife tree guidelines.
56:06
Silviculturist Jim Golden and I were probably the ones that really led that,
56:10
and what we did was we used the coarse woody debris guidelines as a base for
56:15
developing wildlife tree guidelines.
56:20
If the coarse woody debris guidelines are a sort of starting point for
56:24
what we want for coarse woody debris over time, what do we need to have
56:30
to create that process over time?
56:33
In other words, if you always want a certain tonnage of large logs out
56:37
there, you’re going to have to leave some trees in order to create those
56:41
large logs to be there over time, like that would be there in the natural
56:48
disturbance regime and natural succession.
56:51
So we use that as a starting point and we develop models for leaving
56:55
how many trees of different sizes and different types we ought to be leaving
57:00
in harvest units in order to have this continual supply of coarse woody debris,
57:04
like nature would provide over time.
57:08
That was the next step in the evolution of ecosystem management, which I characterize
57:14
in three steps, what I consider key components of the ecosystem or three
57:22
key pieces of looking at the ecosystem.
57:26
The first being coarse woody debris, the second being standing dead and
57:29
live trees, the third being patterns on the landscape or fragmentation.
57:34
The second part was wildlife trees, and
57:42
in 1986, we developed
57:47
the standing-dead tree part, and were starting to implement that on
57:52
the district, not starting, but were already well into implementation.
57:56
I think it was
57:58
spring of 1987, the big ecosystem conference in Corvallis, and the fall
58:04
of 1986, I made a presentation to the regional leadership team meeting, as
58:09
they had started talking about ecosystem management and I was asked to speak,
58:13
asked to be one of the speakers there and
58:19
there were a number of other folks there.
58:39
Anyway, he [Kerrick?] had spoken to the regional leadership team at the same
58:42
time, we were on the agenda together, and he said, “Geez, you need to be on the
58:46
conference agenda for the session in the spring,” and I said, “Okay.” I had never
58:52
done anything like that before, but he had given a similar presentation about what we
58:57
were doing and about coarse woody debris, wildlife trees, that kind of thing.
59:03
That’s when things really started to pick up in terms of
59:06
the visibility of the program.
59:11
That again, was the second stage of evolution regarding the
59:15
pieces of ecosystem management.
59:18
The last was the fragmentation part, and we can talk about that later if
59:26
you wanted to.
59:26
Why don’t you go ahead and get into it now.
59:28
Well, how that developed, Jerry Franklin went on a leave of absence,
59:32
a sabbatical back east, and I think it was at the Harvard Forest.
59:38
He was there,
59:41
and he and another scientist began talking about forest
59:47
fragmentation or harvest patterns.
59:51
And they had done some modeling and he came back for
59:57
a week or two, I don’t remember what year, so
1:00:02
he was on the Andrews and we spent some time talking, he and several of
1:00:08
us, Fred Swanson and some other folks.
1:00:09
He was explaining, he had some drawings and some graphs, and was talking
1:00:14
about patterns on the landscape.
1:00:16
For years, I had always questioned why we were doing 40-acre clear cuts,
1:00:22
as they didn’t seem to fit anything in terms of the natural pattern, but
1:00:26
that is kind of what we had done.
1:00:27
We didn’t have a lot of better information on why we shouldn’t be doing it.
1:00:32
But we had talked about that issue and he [Franklin] had all these figures
1:00:36
about the ecological implications.
1:00:39
Basically the modeling they had done was checkerboard,
1:00:46
and
1:00:48
the computer modeling that they did, showed that once you had harvested,
1:00:51
that if you harvest in staggered settings in every other block after
1:00:56
you have harvested about 30 percent of the acreage in an area, you have
1:01:02
pretty well eliminated big pieces.
1:01:07
And once you have harvested 50 percent, the largest piece that
1:01:09
you have left is the same size as the piece you have been harvesting.
1:01:12
That’s a checkerboard, as every other block has been harvested.
1:01:15
If you visualize that the black has been harvested and the white is left,
1:01:19
the largest pieces, the squarest, are the same square as the black.
1:01:23
So,
1:01:25
we got to talking about that, and I said the implications are
1:01:28
that we ought to be harvesting bigger blocks, and he said, yes.
1:01:31
We ought to be consolidating our harvest units, and so we
1:01:36
did some modeling, and we did a
1:01:43
hypothetical harvest pattern in an existing watershed, on the
1:01:50
Lookout Creek drainage, I think it was on the Blue River side.
1:01:55
We took about a fifteen thousand acre watershed, twelve to fifteen
1:02:01
thousand, we took the existing patterns, this was the very beginning
1:02:07
efforts of GIS, probably been
1:02:15
in 1987, I can’t remember.
1:02:16
We mapped out with different colors where the existing units had been harvested,
1:02:22
had all of the existing units, and then we went through and exorcized on
1:02:25
the district where our planners said,
1:02:30
“Okay, if we are going to continue harvesting at the existing rate,
1:02:33
the allowable cut rate, which is the sustainable level we would add
1:02:38
a certain number of units per year.”
1:02:43
And so, they hypothetically added units around this watershed with
1:02:50
the traditional approach. In other words, you stagger them around so that you
1:02:53
don’t have units next to one another.
1:02:56
Then we went back and did it a different way, and said, “Okay, if we were going
1:02:59
to consolidate our units, try to group them in places where it is the most
1:03:05
fragmented now, and save the biggest pieces until later, what would do the
1:03:09
same number of acres, but just with a different pattern on the landscape.” So
1:03:13
we did that and mapped all of this with GIS, we had different colors and all that.
1:03:18
But the result was we had two slides side-by-side.
1:03:22
One was the traditional staggered-setting approach, and one was what we called
1:03:25
the minimum fragmentation approach; the same number of acres harvested,
1:03:32
and the same period of time.
1:03:35
We had been harvesting three decades in this watershed and we looked at
1:03:39
an additional three decades, and after the additional three decades,
1:03:43
with the staggered setting approach, there were no large blocks left,
1:03:48
everything was just small pieces.
1:03:50
With the minimum fragmentation approach, we had some big pieces left.
1:03:53
What we said, if nothing else,
1:04:06
after three more decades, you have some options left to maintain some big blocks
1:04:11
if you want, but the areas that are being regenerated are also going to be bigger
1:04:16
blocks over time, the same age crop.
1:04:18
So you are going to have to harvest bigger blocks instead of little pieces
1:04:22
of them, of different age classes, you are going to have blocks of age classes.
1:04:28
We were able to make the case at that point for minimum fragmentation
1:04:33
being the way we ought to go.
1:04:37
What we ended up doing on the district, is
1:04:45
basically, every timber sale with a few exceptions, had to have an environmental
1:04:49
assessment that came up with at least one minimum fragmentation alternative.
1:04:55
In a non-traditional way, grouping our harvest center, in some cases
1:04:58
we had opportunities for more than one minimum fragmentation approach.
1:05:02
There were different ways of achieving these groupings, and in probably 75
1:05:09
percent of the cases, we selected them in fragmentation alternatives.
1:05:12
What that required, was to get approval for large blocks, because
1:05:18
there was still a limitation that you couldn’t harvest larger than
1:05:20
60 acres in a Douglas-fir region.
1:05:23
And we were harvesting some blocks that were, well over 100 acres, a couple
1:05:28
hundred acres in some cases, and if we weren’t harvesting that large of
1:05:31
block, it was considered an opening because there was an existing unit
1:05:35
next to it that hadn’t grown up enough.
1:05:37
So, that was still part of the same opening, so we had to, basically
1:05:39
get reviewed by the regional office, but they were approving it.
1:05:44
And so we had begun implementation of that and it was pretty strongly
1:05:48
implemented by the time I left in ‘89.
1:05:54
That was still a brand new approach,
1:05:58
I didn’t think the district continued doing that, but it wasn’t too long
1:06:02
after I left, they started getting into the President’s [Bill Clinton] Forest
1:06:06
Plan [Northwest Forest Plan] , and they aren’t doing much harvesting at all now.
1:06:09
But we had really strongly begun implementation of that approach.
1:06:16
The way you are describing it, it sounds like boundaries between the
1:06:19
experimental forest and the district began to blur during that period.
1:06:22
Yeah, well, Fred Swanson used to say we were the “experimental
1:06:26
district,” [chuckle] rather than the experiment forest.
1:06:30
Jerry Franklin said you were the “experimental ranger on the
1:06:32
experimental district.” [Chuckle]
1:06:34
Yeah, that’s the way Fred would say it, too.
1:06:38
I
1:06:42
had a few key concepts I was going to go over at some point here.
1:06:44
One of them was adaptive management.
1:06:46
You’ve heard the term adaptive management, as it is being used today.
1:06:51
Adaptive management now has become a bureaucratic process,
1:06:56
with its own bureaucracy.
1:06:58
They have approvals of adaptive management areas and everything else.
1:07:02
The whole concept has been bastardized to the point where it has lost its meaning.
1:07:09
We were doing adaptive management, which means that you have this continual
1:07:15
process of research and management working together, and you make
1:07:18
adjustments as you get better information.
1:07:21
We were doing that without any kind of formal agreement or formal arrangement.
1:07:25
We were doing it because we were communicating, and the coarse woody
1:07:33
debris idea was based on a very simple,
1:07:38
an informal get together of people.
1:07:39
We didn’t have any formal scientific papers that came out of that.
1:07:44
It was based on very good intuitive knowledge and good
1:07:48
science, from my perspective.
1:07:50
But we didn’t require a fifty-page report to prepare a
1:07:54
coarse woody debris guideline.
1:07:55
We just prepared one and went.
1:07:57
Then, with wildlife tree guidelines, that was based on the same kind of
1:08:02
interactions and kind of discussion about the importance of trees.
1:08:06
If you look at the harvest units over the years at Blue River [District] , all
1:08:10
of the units became that way, with large numbers of standing dead and green trees.
1:08:15
That was again, based on this interaction.
1:08:19
We adapted, we started leaving them more in clumps, because we found it
1:08:24
operationally, that was easier to do with skyline logging, than just
1:08:27
leaving scattered individual trees.
1:08:29
And it was probably more, rather than this uniform distribution of trees
1:08:35
around the landscape, more non-uniform or random distribution, which was more
1:08:40
reflective of natural disturbance, anyway.
1:08:46
But that’s adaptive management, you adjust, you try, you adjust.
1:08:56
I mean, it’s a discussion, implementation, adjustment, discussion, implementation,
1:09:00
adjustment; sort of a continual cycle.
1:09:03
That’s real adaptive management, and the same thing happened with fragmentation,
1:09:06
I mean that was based on a few hours of discussion, leading to a totally radical
1:09:14
approach on implementing harvest units
1:09:18
on the ground.
1:09:20
We didn’t go through weeks and weeks of scientific reports, and months of
1:09:27
preparing documentation and justification.
1:09:30
That was based on good discussion on science, and to me, that’s
1:09:35
real adaptive management.
1:09:37
Now some people would say that’s crazy, I mean, how can you be
1:09:41
making major changes in something as important as management on the ground
1:09:46
based on a few hours of discussion?
1:09:49
But it wasn’t based on a few hours of discussion.
1:09:51
It was based on thirty years of Jerry Franklin’s knowledge.
1:09:58
I don’t know if you’ve gone to art shows, but
1:10:02
I’ve seen
1:10:05
little placards next to an artist’s painting that says, you may wonder
1:10:10
why I charge $500 for a painting that takes me twenty hours.
1:10:15
Well, it didn’t take me twenty hours; it took me fifteen
1:10:17
years of learning to get there.
1:10:19
It is the same thing with this, it wasn’t just based on two or three
1:10:23
hours of discussion, it was based on, at that point, fifteen years of
1:10:26
my experience, based on thirty years of science, it was based on all of
1:10:29
these things that came together.
1:10:32
And that to me, is real adaptive management.
1:10:35
It is not a bureaucratic process.
1:10:36
It’s people getting together, and talking and adjusting.
1:10:41
But as you pointed out earlier, that is unusual, isn’t it?
1:10:44
Absolutely.
1:10:45
That was totally anomalous at that point, I mean, there were people
1:10:49
who thought that we were nuts, you
1:10:54
know, people in the mainstream of
1:10:57
forestry.
1:10:59
There were critics at Oregon State University, there were critics in
1:11:03
the industry, there were critics within the Forest Service that
1:11:07
would come out and talk about what we were doing and why, and they would
1:11:11
just shake their heads and walk away.
1:11:12
They couldn’t believe that we were doing things like that.
1:11:15
What were their important points of concern?
1:11:18
You guys are basing this on inadequate science.
1:11:22
You guys are doing things that are not operationally
1:11:26
practical.
1:11:27
You
1:11:30
have got to recognize this was a small element and they were
1:11:35
very much in the minority.
1:11:36
Some
1:11:39
key terms were collaboration and
1:11:46
synergy,
1:11:53
which made things work from my perspective and made them credible.
1:12:01
We
1:12:04
had science, scientists and managers “standing on the road” together, talking
1:12:10
to people, pointing to what we were doing. When somebody would say to me as the
1:12:17
manager, how can you be doing this? You don’t have the science that backs you up.
1:12:22
I could turn to the scientist and they would talk about why are we doing
1:12:25
something and what is the importance.
1:12:27
When somebody would say to Fred or Art or Jerry, “I guess the science
1:12:33
is pretty good, but you guys can’t do this in a practical way, it’s not
1:12:40
implementable, you can’t log this, or it’s too expensive,” or whatever.
1:12:44
They would turn to me and I would say, “What do you mean we can’t, we did
1:12:47
it, here’s what it cost, here’s how we did it.“ People would then say, “Well,
1:12:53
it doesn’t meet safety regulations, OSHA will get you.” And I would say,
1:12:57
“It certainly does, because OSHA has been out here and they have looked at
1:13:01
this.” Then they might say, “Well you can’t log it with a skyline,” and I
1:13:02
answered, “Well, we did log it with a skyline, here’s the example.” We had the
1:13:07
credibility of both science and management working together to blunt criticisms,
1:13:14
and again, that is part of adaptive management, as you have
1:13:18
to be willing to take a look at things and answer criticisms.
1:13:25
And you know, people would bring up valid points, and that was part of adaptive
1:13:28
management, and we would make adjustments.
1:13:31
I’m curious how you went about
1:13:34
creating the kind of framework for communications, and what your talking
1:13:35
points and goals were for those communications, and how those were
1:13:42
being related to people who came through tours, even critics of the place.
1:13:47
And at the other end of that, how do you go about communicating management concerns
1:13:53
to researchers and working with them to insure that the kind of research that they
1:13:57
are doing are things that are practical.
1:13:59
You
1:14:08
just do it.
1:14:09
Just do it.
1:14:09
You stand your ground and just do it, and you have to have a commitment to do it.
1:14:12
That’s what made the Andrews, the whole Andrews operation work;
1:14:17
the right people were involved.
1:14:21
We had people
1:14:26
who had a common vision, and I think, we were in it for the same reason.
1:14:34
There were permutations of those reasons, but our basic objective was, we wanted
1:14:39
to improve the quality of the land and forest management on the ground.
1:14:45
You know, as long as you sort of have that
1:14:52
common focal point, there’s lots of different ways to get there.
1:14:56
Each one of us are doing different things to get there, but we are also
1:14:59
doing a lot of things together to get
1:15:04
there.
1:15:05
We had the right chemistry and the right wave length, people
1:15:08
wanting to work together and people wanting to communicate.
1:15:12
I made a commitment, personally, to be at the Andrews meetings
1:15:18
virtually every month, as well as many other times that we met.
1:15:25
The research folks made a tremendous commitment
1:15:29
to put on all these sessions
1:15:34
to work with people on the district, have frequent meetings, and
1:15:42
you know, a lot of people don’t understand the amount of commitment
1:15:46
the research folk had to make.
1:15:52
I recognize how much time they spent, as their home station was in Corvallis,
1:15:56
mine at Blue River, so it is pretty easy for me to go to the Andrews.
1:16:00
For them, it was a couple-hour drive every time they came here,
1:16:06
so that’s a lot of time commitment and personal energy commitment.
1:16:10
Now, sure they were down there for research study sometimes anyway,
1:16:14
but a lot of times they weren’t.
1:16:15
I mean, they had to make a special trip for a tour, presentation, or seminar.
1:16:25
Basically, this communication thing is based on commitment, it’s based on
1:16:31
people wanting to make things work and
1:16:36
wanting to spend the time talking about stuff.
1:16:39
And we had another key person at the
1:16:46
PNW, Cynthia Miner.
1:16:46
Have you talked to Cynthia?
1:16:47
Yeah, I work with her.
1:16:48
She was a technology transfer person, and she and
1:16:56
others who have interviewed me, have asked me the same
1:16:58
questions: What made this work?
1:17:00
What made technology transfer work?
1:17:02
Because what they were trying to do is clone the technology
1:17:06
transfer coming off the Andrews.
1:17:08
But the bottom line, when I get done talking with them, there
1:17:13
is no way you can clone it.
1:17:15
The only way that this works is because you’ve got people who want to make it
1:17:18
work, people with the right chemistry.
1:17:21
You can read all the text books and all the guidelines and all that you want,
1:17:31
that say, “You ought to do this and this and this,” but the bottom line, is you
1:17:35
need a person who has the commitment to communicate, and if you have the person
1:17:39
with the commitment that wants to make it work, and I don’t mean just one person,
1:17:42
you have to have a group of people, you don’t need the guidelines, cause it’s
1:17:45
going to happen. It’s kind of one of those paradoxical situations to some extent.
1:17:51
There are some things that you can give as general guidelines that
1:17:53
help facilitate the process, but we had the right chemistry and that’s
1:17:57
what made the communication work.
1:18:01
Is that what really brought those people together at that
1:18:04
point in time and that place?
1:18:05
Well, I saw in your prospectus that some of that was a self-selection
1:18:10
process to some extent.
1:18:13
The right people moved in and out of there to the point where
1:18:16
you had the right chemistry.
1:18:19
Not everybody in the Andrews group
1:18:24
were actively involved in all of these conversations, but everybody was welcomed.
1:18:32
There were other people that were players in this whole effort that weren’t as
1:18:37
actively involved but were key players nonetheless, and had good relationships.
1:18:42
Tim Schowalter, a really good guy and he
1:18:47
was not necessarily somebody who was in on everything.
1:18:52
He had
1:18:55
a specific interest, in entomology, was a little more focused, and
1:18:59
I’m just using Tim as an example,
1:19:05
and I mean, he was an active member.
1:19:16
They formally called those meetings, but
1:19:21
they were relatively informal, and they would sort of make up an agenda
1:19:24
of topics they wanted to cover.
1:19:28
A lot of the focus of those meetings were chapters and books, who was writing what,
1:19:35
when is a grant proposal due and who was going to do what, and that kind of stuff.
1:19:38
But there was a lot of informal discussion about the kinds of
1:19:44
research projects that were going on, that group’s role in reviewing
1:19:50
research proposals for research, and
1:19:56
deciding which ones should occur.
1:19:59
Because the Andrews is a finite resource, for example, if somebody
1:20:04
wanted to harvest 6000 acres, somebody would have review the proposal.
1:20:11
There was of a combination of formality and informality, but we had an opportunity
1:20:20
to discuss possibilities, when something would come up, would we
1:20:25
like to do this research project.
1:20:28
One of my roles, at least I considered one of my roles, was to look for
1:20:33
opportunities to help implement it.
1:20:38
Probably one of the better examples we had, was log decomposition [Mark
1:20:43
Harmon] . We were able to assist implementation [funds] of a fair amount
1:20:46
of the installation of that research with a timber sale, and that saved a
1:20:52
lot of research money for other things.
1:20:56
We actually had the logger take logs from the harvest area, put them on
1:21:01
a truck, and he built the roads.
1:21:05
Have you talked
1:21:06
-- ? -- talked to Mark Harmon.
1:21:06
But the logger built the roads for the installation sites.
1:21:11
I mean, there is a whole bunch of bedding sites around, there were like
1:21:15
five different sets of bedding sites.
1:21:18
The logger built the road, he put the logs on his truck, went out there,
1:21:21
had a self-loader on his truck.
1:21:24
And we went out there with, not a self-loader, but another
1:21:27
loader, and he took them off the truck and set them in the sites.
1:21:31
They worked with the researchers to do all that, and all of that
1:21:34
was covered by the timber sale.
1:21:35
You know, that was a very non-traditional approach.
1:21:38
You were just working under the contract.
1:21:40
Absolutely, the contract was even to the point, ahead of
1:21:44
time, and the process was so
1:21:50
different, that we actually had the people who were potentially interested
1:21:55
in the timber sale come to a briefing, went out and looked at the sites with
1:22:01
our presale and timber sale folks and researchers, and they had to along with
1:22:08
their bids and submit a proposal on how they were going to get the work done
1:22:13
within the framework of the requirements.
1:22:14
There was a requirement that
1:22:18
the logs had to be harvested and placed within a very narrow time frame before
1:22:21
they would be attacked by insects [corrupting data baseline for project]
1:22:21
. It was a very narrow time frame from
1:22:33
the standpoint that we had potential difficulties with fire danger shutting the
1:22:37
operation down, or rains coming too soon and shutting some of the operation down.
1:22:42
It was a very complex project.
1:22:46
But they had to submit a proposal on how they were going to get things done
1:22:48
within this narrow window of time.
1:22:51
So, it wasn’t just a matter of how much they bid, but also the process, and we
1:22:57
used special timber sale authorities that our presale folks had to research
1:23:04
to be able to do all of this work.
1:23:06
That was how we assist
1:23:12
in the installation and implementation of this project.
1:23:16
And that came through because of the dialogue at the LTER meetings?
1:23:19
That is where the idea came up.
1:23:21
Someone would say, “I think we ought to explore this,” and it would just
1:23:22
kind of developed and evolved to the point where we had a very detailed
1:23:30
flow diagram with specific times that things had to be done in order to get
1:23:37
things done by a date.
1:23:39
Where would I find a copy of that?
1:23:42
The flow diagram?
1:23:44
Yeah.
1:23:44
Geez, I don’t know.
1:23:45
Mark Harmon might have a copy of it, I don’t know.
1:23:48
I doubt if it would even be around anymore.
1:23:53
I don’t think I have it.
1:23:56
But there is another example, we had in the Quartz Creek log
1:24:01
installation [into streams] project, with Stan Gregory and his folks.
1:24:07
It actually started, and
1:24:10
the H.J. Andrews group were doing the log introduction study up in the Andrews.
1:24:17
I drove by there one day and they were carrying all their logs down to the creek.
1:24:24
And these were logs that obviously had to be small enough you could carry them.
1:24:28
They were about this diameter [using hands to show size] , and carrying
1:24:29
them down the creek, they were putting them in the creek, and they were
1:24:31
mapping where they installed them.
1:24:34
And then they had each one of them tagged and they tracked where they ended up.
1:24:40
And I said, “You know, this doesn’t work because it does not really
1:24:45
replicate a natural event, because number one, your logs were so
1:24:49
small, and they are not like a big
1:24:55
log.
1:24:55
Why don’t do something that really replicates
1:25:00
what nature might do?” He [Gregory] said, “Well, you can’t do that by carrying
1:25:03
stuff.” And I said, “Well, how about if we use a timber sale?“ So, we actually
1:25:08
put up a timber sale in an area that would generate KV money [Knutson-Vandenberg
1:25:13
Act funds retained form timber sale receipts] , to put logs in a stream.
1:25:16
We did it in a stream that needed woody debris, that had been cleaned
1:25:19
out of all of the coarse woody debris a number of years before
1:25:22
[Standard practices of the day]
1:25:23
. Going back to the ‘64 floods and after, in the Cascades there was this massive
1:25:29
effort of cleaning coarse woody debris out of streams because it caused these
1:25:32
problems with bridges and culverts.
1:25:34
Well, this stream had been cleaned out and it really effected fish habitat.
1:25:39
So we were able to say, for fish habitat purposes on a good sized stream, “We
1:25:46
want to go back in and put coarse woody debris in the fish habitat.” But we
1:25:48
did it in conjunction with Stan and his folks in a way that would meet
1:25:52
the needs of their research project.
1:25:54
He and his folks were the ones who directed how the logs were
1:25:58
placed, and we used our money to install the whole project.
1:26:03
It was really a neat project, it benefited the stream, and
1:26:08
benefited research together.
1:26:10
So those kind of discussions showed how we were always looking for opportunities.
1:26:13
Are there any examples of it going the other direction?
1:26:16
Where you have got management needs and some management
1:26:19
concerns that you need answers to?
1:26:22
Well, everything we were working on has stuff that we need answers to.
1:26:25
I mean that, the same with the Quartz Creek.
1:26:30
We needed answers as to whether or not those kinds of introductions were
1:26:33
effective for fish, and regarding coarse woody debris, everything that they were
1:26:39
learning was going to be helping us answer the question of how much and what
1:26:42
kind of coarse woody debris was good.
1:26:44
The log decomp studies were answering those questions; how much, what
1:26:49
kind, and what are the benefits.
1:26:53
So, we were always talking to them about
1:27:00
the practical aspects and implications of what they were doing, in terms of
1:27:06
logging difficulty and that kind of stuff.
1:27:08
That was always part of that discussion,
1:27:11
of this interactive process.
1:27:14
Really not the way I characterized it.
1:27:16
This would be more
1:27:19
of a two-way relationship?
1:27:21
It was just always
1:27:25
adaptive management, we were giving them information, they
1:27:28
were giving us information.
1:27:31
It influenced both sides.
1:27:34
Were there any areas of potential conflict in that process between what
1:27:38
your goals were as district ranger?
1:27:40
Were there ways that created problems?
1:27:46
Well, there was always this issue of how much should we be harvesting?
1:27:50
And we were pretty open.
1:27:54
When I left the district I had had numerous conversations with
1:27:56
different groups but we were in the process of developing a forest plan
1:28:03
[Willamette National Forest] . On the forest, in doing just real
1:28:09
rough calculations on yield and economics and everything.
1:28:16
Our estimate was that the effect of leaving this coarse woody debris and
1:28:21
these standing trees and everything, over time, the implications were perhaps 20-25
1:28:30
percent.
1:28:32
We hadn’t done anything so detailed that I could tell you an exact percent; it
1:28:35
was sort of a roughly figured number.
1:28:37
You
1:28:42
could say that has implications for potential conflict, because we
1:28:47
had not gone through formal changes in the timber sale plan or forest
1:28:51
plan for a reduction, and over time that was going to have to happen.
1:28:56
Did you get any feedback from industry on that issue?
1:29:00
Well, they were all concerned about what we were doing.
1:29:04
There were some folks in industry that thought we had gone off the deep end.
1:29:09
They
1:29:11
were very much opposed to the idea of leaving all these standing
1:29:14
trees out there because that was volume that was going to be lost.
1:29:16
In
1:29:21
retrospect, if we could go back twenty years and implement that process of
1:29:29
coarse woody debris, leave trees, and everything across the landscape,
1:29:34
my hypothesis is that we could have avoided the dramatic change due to
1:29:38
the President’s plan [Northwest Forest Plan] and the spotted owl, and what has
1:29:42
occurred, a ninety percent reduction [harvest on federal lands] . So, which is
1:29:44
better, twenty percent or ninety percent?
1:29:48
To me, that is pretty simple, even if it was a thirty or forty percent reduction.
1:29:52
That is better than ninety.
1:29:53
Ninety is
1:29:57
way too high, but still, it is where it is.
1:30:01
How did you manage those concerns when they were raised?
1:30:04
Because that would be part of your role as ranger, wouldn’t
1:30:06
it, to field those questions?
1:30:09
We just continued talking about what we were doing and why.
1:30:14
It was interesting, the last month I was on the district, January of 1989, a
1:30:20
local industry representative called up the state safety folks, and
1:30:33
asked them to come out and take a look at a timber sale.
1:30:35
This was a timber sale, toward the higher end of the number of leaved trees per
1:30:42
acre, probably ten to fifteen [leaved] trees per acre that we were leaving.
1:30:46
They were a little bit clumpy, as it was a timber sale in a drainage that was
1:30:51
about seventy-five percent cut over, and most previous timber sales had not left
1:30:56
any wildlife trees the previous decades.
1:31:01
So, we did two things in this drainage for this timber sale.
1:31:05
One of them was that it was a minimum fragmentation approach timber sale.
1:31:09
There were two or three islands of timber left in this drainage, and previously
1:31:13
what we would have done was put a couple of units in each one of these islands.
1:31:17
What we did instead was basically focused on one island, and left the other two.
1:31:22
And in this island where we harvested, we left a large number of wildlife trees.
1:31:26
And this industry representative, I
1:31:31
don’t think it was with the support of the logger.
1:31:34
The logger had raised issues with how much volume was being left,
1:31:37
but they couldn’t attack us on how much volume was being left, so they
1:31:40
were going to attack us on safety.
1:31:42
He called up the state safety folks, with the idea of bringing them out
1:31:45
there and getting them to shut us down.
1:31:49
We went out to the sale, and there were two state safety people, and one of
1:31:52
them was like a supervisor from Salem.
1:31:55
We went out to the timber sale, and I was there, with the sale administrator
1:32:00
and the timber sale assistant, or timber management assistant at that
1:32:03
time, Marty Wilson, and there may have been a couple other folks as well.
1:32:10
Went out on the ground, and it started out with this guy, basically attacking us.
1:32:19
The state safety folks started asking us questions about how to implement
1:32:22
this, so we pulled out our guidelines and the contract clauses, and the
1:32:28
way we implemented these leave trees.
1:32:30
Rather than us marking the trees that were to be left, we required in the
1:32:35
contract that the purchaser leave a certain number of trees per acre and
1:32:37
that he decide which ones they are based upon these guidelines, which were about
1:32:42
size and species and that kind of stuff.
1:32:44
But it was up to him to make sure that they were left, and we basically
1:32:48
put in there that they need to be left in a way that is safe,
1:32:53
and so they asked us questions about that, and we gave them the contract
1:32:56
clauses and talked a little bit longer.
1:32:58
The logger said, “Yeah, that’s what we’re doing.” And they [safety officials]
1:33:00
said, “What happens when you end up with a tree here that is unsafe?” And the
1:33:04
logger said, “The sales administrator told us to go ahead and cut that and
1:33:08
leave another one somewhere else.” He said, “Is that what you are doing?” He
1:33:12
answered, “Yeah.” They looked around the landing, looked at it, and said, “This
1:33:15
looks great, I wish everybody was doing
1:33:19
it.” [Chuckle]
1:33:19
That’s how we handled it, as basically we were doing things in a way that
1:33:23
met all the guidelines and made sense.
1:33:27
We just fielded the criticism.
1:33:29
And again, to Mike Kerrick goes the credit.
1:33:32
When the criticism came, he tried to deflect it back to us rather
1:33:36
than him, to avoid everybody running to the forest supervisor.
1:33:40
And the bottom line was they just didn’t have grounds for
1:33:43
the criticism to stick, and
1:33:47
the volume concerns over time would be more a forest plan kind of issue,
1:33:52
as I’ve said before the forest plan got implemented, they got into the
1:33:56
President’s forest plan, and now there is a ninety percent reduction in volume.
1:33:59
So it’s become a moot point now.
1:34:06
The bottom line was, there was always criticism going on but it
1:34:10
was not to the level where, that it was debilitating our operation,
1:34:16
debilitating our timber operation.
1:34:18
I gather that strategy is to take people up there and show them what you are doing?
1:34:24
Well, if you are honest and open
1:34:27
about
1:34:31
it.
1:34:31
I think people for the most part, were very much tuned into the perspective
1:34:37
that it was not just a respect for research community, but an act for
1:34:43
involvement and a desire to be actively involved and to implement new things.
1:34:51
For the most part, except for really radical approaches,
1:34:59
I think what we were implementing on the district was no different than what would
1:35:04
have been implemented on the Andrews.
1:35:09
So in that respect, I really do believe we were the “experimental district.”
1:35:14
I see nothing wrong with that, as that is where we should have been.
1:35:18
I’m curious about the concept of promoting or institutionalizing support
1:35:22
and creating an interactive environment.
1:35:23
How would exactly would you do that?
1:35:30
Just making sure that people were actively involved,
1:35:37
so they knew what was goings on, lots of communication internally about what was
1:35:40
going on the Andrews, and continually
1:35:46
encouraging people to be actively involved with what was going on in the Andrews.
1:35:51
If you hear a negative tone about something, talk about
1:35:56
it and try and head that off,
1:36:00
eliminating the “we/they” kind of discussions.
1:36:08
There wasn’t any secret, it was just good
1:36:17
communications and people management kind of stuff.
1:36:18
We tried to have everybody involved, including getting researchers
1:36:23
involved in our projects.
1:36:24
I’m
1:36:31
not going to report that I was 100 percent successful, but I think in
1:36:34
general, people on the district knew the scientists, and the scientists
1:36:40
knew a lot of people on the district.
1:36:43
Probably a lot more so than when I started.
1:36:47
And there was
1:36:49
lots of involvement.
1:36:51
Was there a factor in terms of recruitment and hiring, and was there less turnover
1:36:55
at this district in that period?
1:36:57
Yes, but I really can’t say that
1:37:02
was anything we used as a criterion for hiring somebody, because I felt when
1:37:07
people came here, you didn’t have to say ahead of time, how do you feel about
1:37:12
working with researchers at that point?
1:37:14
That was just part of what we did on the district, and I think most people who
1:37:18
were coming to Blue River for different kinds of positions, like assistant ranger
1:37:22
positions, knew that we had lots going on.
1:37:25
And again, if you have the right folks, they’ve got the right perspective on
1:37:31
resource management, it was no jump for them in terms of working with researchers.
1:37:36
That was just natural.
1:37:37
We had seminars, we had interactions, and it was just sort of a logical thing
1:37:48
to happen.
1:37:48
You were talking before about the self-selection of the group there,
1:37:51
and with the LTER kicking in, seeing that this had become more well-known
1:37:57
and which had much to say, there was some element of that people
1:38:01
saw this as an interesting place.
1:38:03
Well, I think so.
1:38:07
We certainly had recognition around the region at that point, amongst a
1:38:11
lot of people, a lot more visibility.
1:38:15
We had Vince Puleo, a name I’m sure that has come up and
1:38:18
you’ve probably talked to him.
1:38:18
Vince was a good sort of a liaison, and he is sort of an unsung hero in a sense.
1:38:29
He did a lot
1:38:33
of the routine work, but he was also the person who did a lot of
1:38:36
the coordination on the district,
1:38:44
obviously a key individual in helping carry all of the stuff,
1:38:49
with
1:38:52
lots and lots of communication.
1:38:54
Vince was a person who would, if there were friction points in terms of
1:38:58
projects going on, he was often times the one who sorted it out and got the
1:39:02
right people involved, and insured that they knew what was going on.
1:39:08
But in terms of facilities, accommodations, and headquarters
1:39:12
up there, I don’t know if you’ve been back since they built the
1:39:18
new facilities.
1:39:18
How often do you go back there now?
1:39:20
I’ve been back almost every year.
1:39:23
I’m now involved with the Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources, and
1:39:30
so I make a trip back annually for that.
1:39:32
I’m going back in March this year.
1:39:36
Yeah, it used to be called the “ghetto in the meadow.” I’m
1:39:38
sure you’ve heard that term.
1:39:43
The facilities were a little bit rough, but they
1:39:51
minimally met the needs, at the time.
1:39:56
We had a lot of groups go through there, including the regional
1:40:01
leadership team one time.
1:40:03
We had a big meal for them catered there at the Jobs Corps center,
1:40:15
which functioned in terms of a facility.
1:40:19
I’m also interested in, and you made this point earlier, about the number
1:40:22
of projects that were going on.
1:40:24
Did you have any kind of formalized system of logging
1:40:32
people in, to sign in for or to coordinate meetings?
1:40:35
There was this sort of informal process at the LTER meetings.
1:40:37
Is there anything you formally instituted on the district that
1:40:39
you could monitor those activities?
1:40:42
No.
1:40:44
If we were going to be doing any kind of activity, we relied on coordination
1:40:49
with the key individuals on the district.
1:40:52
And particularly with Art [McKee] , to make sure that we weren’t going to
1:40:55
be affecting anything or setting.
1:40:58
Just good communications, but you know, we didn’t have any kind of a policy or
1:41:10
sign-in procedure or anything.
1:41:10
I am also curious about the role of the HJA in terms of recreational issues.
1:41:17
Well, there were some.
1:41:19
Bear hunting was one, and there was interest at one point in in closing
1:41:24
the area to bear hunting, and also interest in closing it to deer hunting.
1:41:31
Those were issues that we kicked around,
1:41:35
recognized the political sensitivity of some of those issues, and
1:41:40
before we were going to do something like that, there had to
1:41:42
be really strong justification.
1:41:44
Of course, Lookout Creek was closed to fishing, and that was pretty
1:41:49
easy to justify in the study sense.
1:41:52
It was a lot harder to deal with, why would we not want
1:41:55
people hunting deer up there.
1:41:57
And
1:41:59
we didn’t take that one on, but that and those kinds of things were discussed.
1:42:04
Lookout Creek was closed to fishing before you got there.
1:42:07
Wasn’t it?
1:42:07
Yeah, it had been for a long time.
1:42:11
In
1:42:15
looking back, which particular study would you see as most significant at the
1:42:20
Andrews that you were involved in, for
1:42:26
example,
1:42:29
log placement and things like that.
1:42:36
Well, log decomposition was certainly an
1:42:41
important one.
1:42:45
What was interesting about that was it was a two hundred year study.
1:42:48
I think there was a lot of chuckling outside the research
1:42:54
community about anything that would be a two hundred year study.
1:42:56
You know, that was initially conceptualized, but what was
1:43:03
interesting about that was even within one to two years, they were finding
1:43:08
out some really interesting stuff,
1:43:13
information on what is within log ecosystems.
1:43:17
Let us see
1:43:22
what’s happening inside that wood.
1:43:25
Tim Schowalter worked with insects in the upper canopy, and they
1:43:30
were finding insects they didn’t even know existed in that area.
1:43:34
There were
1:43:37
just so many different things that you can find out,
1:43:43
I don’t even know the names of all of the studies.
1:43:45
There were studies in Lookout Creek dealing with coarse woody debris,
1:43:49
and fish habitat in Quartz Creek.
1:43:55
When we started dealing with the issue of fragmentation,
1:44:01
the feedback and discussions we were having on hydrological implications
1:44:05
and all of that, we started to examine some of those issues.
1:44:13
Also, landslide studies.
1:44:17
There were two Quartz Creeks on the district, and the other Quartz Creek
1:44:20
where there were some blow outs from the winter storms one year, and
1:44:27
had time lapse photography in the creek that showed the changes in
1:44:33
stream levels until the slide came down and wiped out the camera.
1:44:38
All of that was on film.
1:44:44
There were so many different studies.
1:44:50
There was one.
1:44:53
I don’t remember the name of it, but it involved implementation of a
1:44:56
shelter wood for a new harvest method, new harvest techniques in one sale
1:45:02
where we left lots of standing trees.
1:45:07
Sort of an initial effort.
1:45:12
We used that a lot as an example of what can be done for both coarse
1:45:19
woody debris and standing trees.
1:45:23
You know, there were lots of long term studies, hydrological, the long term
1:45:28
hydrology in different drainages, looking at run-off amounts and soil stability,
1:45:37
and I wouldn’t even know where to start in terms of listing everything.
1:45:40
It just, one after another, it just all added up.
1:45:45
Another one of those questions where I know there is no good answer.
1:45:48
Well, yeah, it’s just a phenomenal list.
1:45:52
The next one may be a little easier, maybe not.
1:45:56
Are there particular disappointments or unanswered questions that you had,
1:46:01
or unexpected complications that lead to not completely satisfactory results?
1:46:12
I guess I must be “pollyanna-ish.” I don’t remember any.
1:46:16
No,
1:46:20
the only one, we had a study that we had discussed for some time, at one point,
1:46:29
Jerry Franklin, coined the name “Phoenix.” The idea was to burn a large patch of
1:46:41
old growth, basically looking at it in terms of natural disturbance regimes;
1:46:47
do a lot of pre-monitoring and then burn this area under the same conditions
1:46:52
that it would normally burn, in other words, in a summer fire. Now that was an
1:46:57
interesting discussion, because what we were talking about was going to be very
1:47:02
complicated and very expensive. I mean, you don’t torch off a seventy or eighty
1:47:05
acre stand of old growth in the summer time without a lot of implications.
1:47:10
That is during fire danger season, and you can’t light it in the middle
1:47:13
of winter time because that is not going to duplicate natural conditions.
1:47:16
This had to be one where it was going to crown out, a high intensity fire, and
1:47:22
we actually had a person on the district who had done a burn plan for an area, and
1:47:28
looked at the implications, potential spot fires two miles away, something like that.
1:47:35
We’re talking about a major project, and
1:47:40
Jerry had just thrown that one out initially, and we sort of reacted like,
1:47:44
“holy moly!” But then, we started talking about it seriously, but that one never
1:47:48
came about. It just didn’t get the
1:47:54
visibility and support to carry that one on.
1:47:56
I think that one would have been a real interesting study.
1:48:00
The question would have been whether that would have given us more qualitative
1:48:07
information that we could get from going back and post-monitoring an area that
1:48:10
had burned, with the problem being, you normally don’t have pre-information of a
1:48:14
burn area [without all that monitoring]
1:48:18
. I guess there is a little disappointment there, but when you’re talking about major
1:48:22
complications and major disappointments,
1:48:27
we always had complications.
1:48:30
I mean, a project like the log decomp had complexities and complications
1:48:35
like you wouldn’t believe.
1:48:40
But, it was one of those things were we just always expected and
1:48:43
that it was going to work out.
1:48:53
The Phoenix project, whatever it was called; that was mainly an issue
1:48:58
of expense and fire danger, being the reasons why it wasn’t done?
1:49:03
I don’t think there was enough interest.
1:49:05
I think, if we wanted to, we could have found over time, the money to do that.
1:49:10
Because it was going to be a high visibility project,
1:49:16
we anticipated you’re going to need 500 people to pull off a seventy-acre burn.
1:49:19
That’s going to be expensive.
1:49:21
You’re going to have to have people posted for a long way,
1:49:26
but it could have been done.
1:49:30
I mean, we just never got to the point that we were ready to go with
1:49:35
the project, and then it was dropped.
1:49:36
On the
1:49:40
stage of evolution from 0 to 10, it probably got to the sub-2 stage.
1:49:44
It just kind of lost interest, and Jerry had left by that time, on
1:49:50
to the University of Washington.
1:49:55
And the conflict, overcoming the complications,
1:50:02
that would be in keeping with this kind of general tone of interests and
1:50:07
cooperation you were talking about before.
1:50:09
Is it just a question of working through the problems?
1:50:12
You know, we just never got to the point where the relationships
1:50:16
deteriorated or anything like that.
1:50:18
I mean, when we would have a tough spot, somebody would call up and
1:50:21
say “Geez, you know we’ve got a problem going on here.” We would find
1:50:26
a solution. And that has happened frequently, little difficulties about,
1:50:34
you know, this road needs to be maintained, or what’s this crew
1:50:37
doing maintaining that road, because they are disturbing something.
1:50:41
We found ways to deal with that, but make sure it didn’t happen again.
1:50:45
Just working through the processes.
1:50:49
I was going to shift gears.
1:50:50
Did you have something else?
1:50:52
I was trying to recall a couple of things I had listed here in
1:50:57
terms of some things we’ve really already talked about to some extent.
1:51:04
I’m
1:51:07
sure you know about the ecosystem video,
1:51:13
one of the more significant things that we did for technology transfer, and I
1:51:17
can give you some anecdotes about that.
1:51:19
After that ecosystem conference in, I think it was spring of 1987, Oregon State
1:51:27
applied for and received $10,000 from the regional office [Region 6 – USFS]
1:51:33
, as the regional forester had a fund of money every year for regional forester’s
1:51:39
“challenge project.” You submit a region, a written justification on
1:51:45
how and why you would use the money.
1:51:48
So, I got the money, and with that money we produced the ecosystem video,
1:51:55
a little over two hours in length.
1:52:13
It
1:52:22
was done by Oregon State University, and was entitled, “Perspectives on
1:52:25
Ecosystem Management.” And here’s a
1:52:31
flier about it, “Perspectives on - ” It was really a neat deal.
1:52:36
We had a partnership with the
1:52:42
Oregon State media center.
1:52:44
Really neat people to work with, and for what would have normally cost us
1:52:53
a lot more.
1:52:54
I think it was an hour and 15 minutes, and an hour and 10 minutes [two parts] , so
1:52:54
that’s almost two and a half hours, no
1:53:03
actually, almost
1:53:13
a hundred and sixty minutes, which is about a hundred
1:53:16
and sixty thousand dollars.
1:53:18
I think you figure $1000.00 a minute is what a video tape
1:53:20
costs, and we got it for ten.
1:53:23
High quality, and it’s got all the key players there,
1:53:27
talking about the Franklins, the Masers, the Swansons, and the
1:53:36
McKees; all those guys are on the tape.
1:53:37
And each has little segments on the video tape talking about ecosystem
1:53:43
management; riparian management,
1:53:47
fragmentation, forest ecosystems, and Dave Perry talking about soils.
1:53:50
And dah-did-dah, I mean, it was a big deal.
1:53:55
We distributed a copy of this tape to every forest in the
1:53:57
region, and they are also on sale.
1:54:03
I still have people, to this day, that are using that tape.
1:54:09
There is an instructor at Itaska Community College, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and
1:54:15
when I met him, he said, “Oh yeah, you’re on that video tape. He’s been using it
1:54:21
for his classes for all these years.
1:54:23
That was produced in ‘87.
1:54:28
To me that was a significant product of our partnership, and it was
1:54:31
really a neat project doing it.
1:54:34
Just before I left, we did one [video] on forest fragmentation, which talks
1:54:37
about the minimum fragmentation approach.
1:54:40
Again, it was done through the Oregon State media center.
1:54:44
Those were neat projects,
1:54:50
ones that I consider important.
1:54:57
One of the things I did was to
1:55:02
come up with a couple of points to summarize some key aspects
1:55:06
of the Andrews relationship.
1:55:09
We already talked about adaptive management.
1:55:12
That was one of the key things that was going on there.
1:55:15
I prefaced it with the adjective, real adaptive management.
1:55:21
I don’t characterize what’s going on in adaptive management areas
1:55:26
as real adaptive management, because it has become a bureaucratic process
1:55:30
where they have a board reviewing what can be implemented, what can’t
1:55:34
be done, and all that kind of stuff.
1:55:35
When you get to that point, that is no longer adaptive management,
1:55:39
you’ve institutionalized the bureaucratic process and real adaptive
1:55:43
management isn’t occurring at all.
1:55:45
You’ve heard Richard Nixon’s seminar on spontaneity?
1:55:48
[Laughs] Yeah, that’s right.
1:55:52
You know the old joke that sincerity is the real key, and once you can
1:55:56
fake it that you’ve got it made?
1:56:00
It’s just not the real deal.
1:56:02
The other thing we talked about was the common vision, another key word of
1:56:10
what went on there.
1:56:11
People that were involved in the Andrews operation had a common vision,
1:56:14
and that kept us from focusing on the minor, day-to-day difficulties.
1:56:23
Again, Art McKee and I could have been fighting about little things all the time,
1:56:32
but neither one of us have that inclination, because we have loftier
1:56:36
goals we were working towards.
1:56:38
And Art’s a neat guy anyway, but
1:56:42
never stooped to that level.
1:56:45
We could have found things to fight about, but we didn’t.
1:56:51
We talked about the synergy.
