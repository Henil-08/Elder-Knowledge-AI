00:02
Synergy.
00:03
That’s how I characterize the whole, as synergetic, a synergistic
00:07
process that together accomplishes a lot more than either of these
00:13
things would accomplish alone.
00:15
You know, making changes and doing these things.
00:19
It was just a partnership between research and management.
00:21
That is what
00:24
it is all about.
00:27
The collaboration, working together.
00:29
That kind of thing was
00:35
really neat.
00:37
Two other things that I listed, and one of them was passion.
00:40
That’s what made an awful lot of things work, some people
00:43
who had chemistry, that passion
00:49
for our work.
01:04
I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever, that ecosystem management in the Forest
01:08
Service and as a national paradigm, would not have happened if it had
01:13
not been for that period of time, three to four years, things really
01:16
working together on the Andrews.
01:19
There’s not one iota of doubt in my mind that’d never have surfaced if
01:27
we had not been working together.
01:30
I’m sure that you’d find some people who would disagree with that, maybe
01:34
even among the Andrews group, but because of the visibility of the
01:38
process, what we were doing to bring it about, and the results of
01:45
the real and visible things that brought about this national
01:49
movement to ecosystem management.
01:50
This included a lot of articles and discussions from Jerry Franklin.
01:54
He had great visibility in regards to New Forestry, and many articles
02:00
on the subject in major publications.
02:04
Jerry had an awful lot of visibility in 1988, ‘89, and ‘90, even on Capitol Hill.
02:10
He gave a lot of presentations there, and had a lot of visibility with the
02:15
Forest Service at the national level.
02:17
The reason that the Forest Service, from my perspective, chartered a
02:23
“new perspectives” team, an ecosystem team at the national level, is
02:27
because of Jerry Franklin and the work that was done on the Andrews.
02:34
Jerry was building on all that. I mean, it wasn’t just Jerry alone,
02:37
it was all the stuff going on.
02:38
Jerry was a focal point for that, the spokesperson, and
02:42
I give him credit for that.
02:46
The importance of the work during that several-year period,
02:52
and I may sound arrogant, but I don’t mean to be that way.
02:55
I just really believe that all that spawned the national movement of ecosystem
03:04
management, and there wasn’t visibility of that issue anywhere else in
03:10
the country.
03:10
I do know that’s what caused the major emphasis of that at the
03:14
national level of the Forest Service.
03:16
I had a really interesting perspective of moving from Blue
03:20
River to the Washington Office right during that transition period.
03:23
So I was able to see all that was happening in the Washington office.
03:27
And it was being driven from this effort.
03:30
It was not a Forest Service national level, “Gee, this is an new thing
03:35
and we ought to push it kind of thing.” It was pushed on the Forest
03:39
Service at the national level.
03:41
Congress and other people pushed the Forest Service into doing
03:44
something at the national level.
03:45
Which is how things happen frequently, most often not a top end driven change.
03:52
Change is not driven top end, this kind of change.
03:56
It came from the ground up.
03:58
Who in Congress
04:00
did you see pushing that?
04:00
Guys like Peter DeFazio.
04:02
Peter was a very strong supporter of what we were doing, and I spent time
04:06
with him personally talking about it.
04:09
After I moved to D.C., he asked me to come and put on a presentation
04:12
on Capitol Hill for a number of
04:20
staffers.
04:20
He was certainly a supporter, and he was a critic of the Forest Service
04:23
nationally, pushing things like that.
04:26
But, there was just a general emphasis there, an interest in things, and we
04:31
were getting so much visibility that the Forest Service was sort of getting,
04:35
and if we don’t do something at the national level to capture this initiative,
04:38
we are going to be left behind.
04:40
Again, this is my perspective, but
04:45
I think that’s how it happened.
04:46
The last word that I had was risk.
04:50
To me, the folks that have the biggest risk were the research folks.
04:56
And some of them may have suffered because of things that they did at the
05:02
Andrews, in a little bit different way.
05:05
That was because of this publish or perish mentality in
05:10
research, and it’s really there.
05:13
I mean it’s real, and I’m sure the researchers have talked about this.
05:19
The risk that they were taking, they were spending more of their effort in direct
05:25
technology transfer than they were in writing books and writing publications.
05:31
Every hour that they spent out on a tour was an hour that they weren’t writing.
05:39
And I give them a tremendous amount of credit for that commitment.
05:47
Because to me, because of my experiences on the Andrews,
05:56
I have a personal philosophy that the only effective way,
06:02
the most effective way of transferring technology in dealing with issues
06:06
like we were dealing with, is on the ground, person-to-person.
06:09
It’s not through writing a publication.
06:12
And the reason is we were out on the ground, doing the kinds of things we
06:18
were talking about, talking about the kinds of things we were talking about,
06:23
everybody there comes away with a common picture of what we were talking about.
06:27
When you’re pointing to these wildlife trees, pointing to these practices,
06:32
they are seeing the same thing.
06:33
When you’re sitting in a conference or you’re reading a publication or whatever,
06:41
you’re getting a piece of the picture, and everybody is forming
06:44
a different picture in their minds of what is being talked about.
06:48
Even if you’re showing slides, it’s not the same as a 3-D sweeping panorama.
06:54
You’re giving just a piece of the whole picture.
06:57
Certainly when you’re reading a publication you’re not
06:58
getting the whole picture.
07:01
So, tours reach a much smaller group at any given time than
07:07
other kinds of media or technology transfer, but it’s a lasting thing.
07:16
Everybody there has a common reference point from that point
07:21
on for further discussion.
07:23
So, I am a strong believer in
07:29
doing things on the ground, in-person, because of my experiences there.
07:34
And that’s what I believe the researchers felt as well.
07:39
They felt like they were having a much larger effect, long-term effects,
07:44
by putting their efforts there, but they don’t get credit for that.
07:48
I don’t think the Andrews folks have ever gotten full credit for the
07:51
kinds of things that went on there.
07:53
In fact, there is almost a certain level of professional jealousy
07:59
with the Andrews effort.
08:01
Again, my perspective.
08:04
But, you know, the kind of risks that they were taking, career-wise,
08:10
I have great respect for them, you know the risk and the time commitment.
08:17
I think you’ve answered my question, I think we should transition here, ask you
08:21
about the most significant legacy here.
08:23
I take it you see that as an ecosystem management initiative?
08:28
Yeah,
08:32
I really can’t say it enough times.
08:35
I believe that was the epicenter of the movement, the recent
08:41
movement to ecosystem management.
08:42
I don’t know.
08:42
There are lots of people who say [Aldo Leopold talked about
08:47
ecosystems] , there are a number of other people that talked about
08:49
ecosystem management a long time ago.
08:51
And I agree with that.
08:52
I’m not
08:55
trying to replace those kinds of things.
08:59
In terms of this recent, emphasis, recent movement in the ecosystem arena, I believe
09:09
the Andrews was at the center of that.
09:10
From what you’ve said, you had a strong personal attachment for the people and
09:18
the process you were engaged in there.
09:21
You did leave in ‘89.
09:23
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your decision to leave and
09:26
what attracted you to Washington.
09:27
Well, that’s the toughest decision I’ve ever made in the Forest Service.
09:31
It
09:33
was kind of an interesting process.
09:35
I was in D.C. on a training session,
09:40
this was in the fall of ‘88, and about a year prior to that I had applied
09:44
for a job in Washington, D.C., and
09:50
different things had happened and they hadn’t filled the job.
09:54
I had lost track of it, and was in D.C. for a training session,
09:58
and got a call from Mike Kerrick,
10:03
he said
10:06
we have got a job offer for you in D.C.
10:11
I didn’t even know the job had been re-advertised, but unbeknownst
10:14
to me, it had been re-advertised and my name had been placed in
10:22
the pool.
10:22
I figured if they wanted me the first time, they would have hired me.
10:25
So, my name had been put back into the application pool automatically,
10:30
because I had applied the first time.
10:34
So, here I was in Washington D.C.,
10:40
and I walked around, went and talked to some of the folks in the
10:44
western office, in this position, who would be my supervisors and
10:49
people I would be working with.
10:51
Then I just spent hours walking around on the Washington mall,
10:57
thinking to myself, “Is this what I really want to do?” Because I
11:01
was having a heck of a good time, lots of things were going on,
11:08
and
11:14
I wanted to be a forest supervisor.
11:15
I knew at that point that I did.
11:18
But I also knew that I was really enjoying what I was doing.
11:25
Boy, it was a tough decision.
11:29
I didn’t want to leave what I was doing, but one of the things that
11:31
I had hoped to do was be able to take the lessons learned there [Blue
11:36
River/Andrews] to a higher level.
11:40
I believed that as a district, we had significantly influenced
11:45
things at a much higher level.
11:49
At that point, the Forest Service had still not moved to a new perspective
11:53
in ecosystem management, and I didn’t know that was going to happen,
11:58
but my intent was to take those lessons to a forest level somewhere.
12:02
I didn’t know which forest, but I believed that
12:07
if I could help make a difference at the district ranger level, I thought I
12:11
could certainly help make a difference at a forest supervisor level, maybe
12:15
even a little bigger difference.
12:17
And that’s what ultimately drove me to make that decision.
12:27
For a long time after I made that decision, I wondered if
12:29
it was the right decision.
12:30
You know, because one thing I was giving up was all those close relationships.
12:37
I still have
12:40
a personal friendship with a lot of those people.
12:43
Art McKee and Chris Maser, those are
12:49
the folks that I have maintained the closest relationship with.
12:51
But, giving up the almost day-to-day dialogue and interaction,
13:02
was something that I immediately missed.
13:05
The ability to
13:09
have the intellectual discussions that we had about ecosystems, and
13:17
research folks are fascinating people.
13:20
The kinds of intellectual discussions you can have about all these topics
13:23
on ecosystem management, and you know, what’s the ultimate effect
13:26
on the earth, and what’s the future and all those kind of things.
13:29
Those are the kind of things that really inspire me.
13:36
That’s something that I missed immediately, not that other people can’t
13:39
be intellectual, but a specific kind of discussions dealing with ecosystems.
13:46
And these are people are
13:50
really sharp individuals.
13:59
Even years after I came here, I still wondered if I
14:10
made the right decision.
14:10
I really love the job I’m doing now, and believe we’ve made some real
14:15
differences here, but I will always wonder if that was the right decision,
14:19
and what would have happened if I’d stayed, and what would I be doing now.
14:24
I think I’m a little bit confused.
14:27
The D.C. position you didn’t take.
14:28
Is that right?
14:29
No, I did take it.
14:29
You did take it.
14:30
And what was that?
14:31
That was as the
14:34
National Recreational Strategy Coordinator [Forest Service] . I
14:37
was there a little over two years.
14:45
Your reasons for going from there to Chippewa?
14:47
[National Forest-Minnesota]
14:52
The reason I went to D.C., was really as a sort of stepping
14:56
stone to a forest supervisor job.
14:57
And so, after two years in a Washington office, why, forest
15:03
supervisor jobs started coming open.
15:04
And
15:07
this was actually, believe it or not, the first one I applied for.
15:11
I applied for two or three at the same time, or about the same
15:12
time, but this was the first one that I had actually applied for.
15:17
And this looked like an interesting area, and you know, a good spot.
15:25
I’m
15:28
curious if there were any
15:33
adaptive management ideas you had for Chippewa?”
15:37
Before I came?
15:38
Before you came.
15:39
Is that what attracted you here?
15:40
No.
15:41
I didn’t really know that much about what were the specifics of management.
15:45
I knew more just about the general area.
15:49
I checked it out, and when I did get the job, one of the first things I checked
15:55
was the proximity of research individuals.
16:00
And there is a research lab just on the other edge of the forest at Grand Rapids.
16:06
And
16:09
so I started,
16:13
pretty much when I first came, I started making contacts with the research
16:16
community, and there was a fair amount of turnover in the lab the first few years.
16:25
But some individuals and I began talking about the possibility of doing something
16:31
like an LTER site here, and that looked like it would not happen, because
16:37
the funding from NSF wasn’t there.
16:39
So we said we would do something LTER-like here in the area.
16:44
We will try and duplicate the function of the Andrews, not necessarily as an LTER
16:52
site, but in terms of how things operate.
16:54
And the last year-and-a-half or so, things have really begun to
16:58
develop, really exciting in terms of the commitment to the North Central
17:04
Station, the interest and the people involved and that kind of thing.
17:08
It’s beginning to build to the point where you can see some things now that
17:12
I believe we now can duplicate from.
17:15
The Andrews is one of a kind and always will be, because of not only the
17:21
individuals but the number of individuals.
17:23
You have a large number of people in one spot, Corvallis.
17:29
Here we have a small lab, relatively speaking, and some people in Duluth,
17:35
from the University of Minnesota.
17:38
So we have a much smaller area, number of people to begin with, but we are
17:42
going to create somewhat similar in terms of critical mass, and get some
17:46
things going, and it’s going to operate similarly, but not to the scale.
17:56
You mentioned earlier that Jim Caswell kind of brought you up to speed on
17:59
what was going on in the district.
18:01
How would you characterize your role in the search for a replacement at
18:05
Blue River when you were leaving?
18:06
There wasn’t any.
18:10
No, I had left the area.
18:12
I don’t know that Jim Caswell had any role in my selection either, but I had left
18:17
the area and did not have any opportunity for transition other than a few notes
18:23
I left for my successor [Lynn Burditt] , saying “good luck,” and if you ever
18:30
want to talk about things, let me know.
18:33
If
18:40
you could, maybe you could identify some of the key components of your
18:45
effort to jump start an LTER-like process here, or to replicate to some
18:50
degree what happened on the Andrews.
18:52
What kinds of things do you look for to do that here?
18:55
Developing communication, first of all.
19:05
Maintaining reasonably close contacts, personally, encouragement and
19:16
discussions at the station level and the lab level, knowing the people involved,
19:25
something that I should normally do in my job anyway, but I
19:28
think of it in a higher level.
19:31
Also, involving a fair number of people here on the forest, getting them
19:38
involved in discussions with me and
19:43
interchanges, so that it’s not just me, but it becomes institutionalized.
19:51
Just last month, we had our first joint meeting with the lab, and what I’m
19:58
hoping to do is set that up on a regular basis, so that we meet periodically.
20:04
Something like the LTER meetings in Corvallis, but obviously
20:09
it’s not LTER in this case.
20:11
Just to get together and talk about what are they learning, how can we help, what
20:15
are we finding out, that kind of stuff.
20:16
Because
20:27
of the interest that I have shown, I’ve been
20:33
asked to participate in a number of
20:37
discussions at the North Central Station.
20:42
And I believe that
20:46
some shifts in emphasis have occurred even in terms of helping the
20:53
Grand Rapids, several years after most of the scientists
20:58
had left, you know, retired.
21:00
They [lab] were way down and now there’s this resurgence of
21:06
interest.
21:08
They are actually adding on to the lab, wanting and needing more
21:12
space, and adding scientists.
21:17
It must be rare in the Forest Service right now?
21:19
Yes, research has
21:22
had some tough times.
21:23
But this lab is doing pretty well now.
21:26
And they’ve actually moved some people up from St. Paul,
21:31
some project people,
21:37
so I’m really excited about the commitment that’s being made and the possibilities
21:42
of what we can do together, and the kind of communications that we have.
21:47
We have three experimental forests on the national forest [Chippewa]
21:51
, and none of them are as large or of the same significance as the
21:54
Andrews but there are three of them.
21:56
But what I’ve tried to portray is, let’s not worry about doing
22:01
stuff just on experimental forests, but the whole forest is open.
22:05
We are starting to do studies around the forest,
22:11
it’s just real exciting, and we’ve got really good people to work with.
22:14
One of my questions of you about how you might perceive the role of the
22:18
experimental forests now, compared with when you started working at the Andrews?
22:22
Is it functioning more?
22:24
Yeah.
22:25
I mean the experimental forests on this national forest, and there’s
22:31
been research on some of these experimental forests for many decades.
22:36
Some growth and yield studies on pine, some by Bob Buckman [PNW
22:39
Station Director] , and they actually did burning here back in the ‘50’s.
22:44
This is where he [Buckman] started his research career.
22:47
Some really neat work has been done here, so there’s a long history of
22:51
good work, mostly silviculture-related.
22:55
The focus of the lab at Grand Rapids has shifted to riparian and aquatic
23:00
research, which, from our perspective is pretty appropriate given that the
23:05
Chippewa National Forest has more water than any other national forest.
23:10
The two Minnesota national forests [Chippewa and Superior] together
23:12
have 20-25 percent of the water in the national forest system.
23:16
So we have lots of aquatic-riparian kinds of issues.
23:21
There’s a silviculture element to that John Zasada was involved in.
23:27
You’ve probably heard John’s name in your work.
23:31
John was part of the Andrews group when I was out there.
23:34
John is the
23:38
silviculture researcher our of Rheinlander, Wisconsin, but
23:42
he’s now he’s assigned to the Grand Rapids lab part-time.
23:49
Really neat opportunities.
23:51
In terms of the role of the experimental forest, the
23:58
experimental forest still has a role.
23:59
It’s a place where there are specific management objectives and specific
24:05
management guidelines and specific protections, and I believe they are
24:13
every bit as important as always.
24:15
But in terms of general management and general application of management
24:19
strategies, I believe the whole forest ought to be an experimental forest in
24:22
that sense, or at least open to it.
24:25
Other than
24:29
the specific role of experimental forests, there is no reason why we can’t do
24:32
that [experiment] on the whole forest.
24:35
It doesn’t violate our mission, doesn’t violate the intent of the
24:40
presence of national forests, and it doesn’t compromise the role of the
24:47
experimental forest for research either.
24:53
How would you
24:56
characterize the way in which technology transfer takes place in the
25:08
1990’s as opposed to the 1980’s?
25:11
We were talking about, let’s see, the role of the experimental forests
25:16
- I think we covered it pretty well.
25:22
I was asking about technology transfer.
25:26
Yeah, the role or the method.
25:28
Yeah, or how effective it is now in comparison with earlier?
25:38
Interestingly enough, I
25:45
was part of this report in which we talk about research and management and how
25:50
they should and need to work together.
25:54
I believe, what I’ve talked about earlier, that the most effective way for technology
26:00
transfer to occur is more true today,
26:11
as things begin to evolve faster, the need for good communication, personal
26:18
communications is even more important.
26:22
The role of adaptive management is even more important because the kinds
26:26
of things that we’re finding out.
26:29
I don’t think we can either afford to
26:33
be waiting three or four years for a publication to come out.
26:38
That’s my personal belief.
26:39
I mean, the kind of stuff that we’re finding is the kind of
26:42
stuff we ought to be communicating
26:46
on an immediate basis, and adapting our management to
26:50
account for the new information.
26:54
I don’t
26:58
know
27:01
any other way to describe it.
27:03
To me, that’s more important today than it ever has been.
27:06
We get in this mode nowadays that
27:10
everything has to be electronic, and it’s just not as effective as person-to-person
27:15
communications down on the ground.
27:18
We lose the human touch, you know, the low-tech, the technology transfer
27:22
is to me, the model or the paradigm, even the preferred paradigm.
27:31
I’m curious, you’ve been talking a lot about communications and
27:34
person-to-person interactions.
27:39
Are there obstacles to that in the Forest Service, institutionally or personally?
27:45
Both.
27:52
We have a lot of people working in the Forest Service
27:56
that didn’t join forestry to
27:59
take up communications.
28:03
If you’re familiar with Myers-Briggs, you know personality type mapping
28:07
[test] , and the Forest Service has a much higher percentage of people, I believe,
28:12
on the introverted end of the scale.
28:16
People tend to take natural resource management, get out
28:19
there in the woods, and be alone.
28:21
We’ve always talked about that, and I believe to some extent, it is true.
28:25
But it is probably less true today than it was ten years ago,
28:27
but I still think it is true.
28:29
So
28:32
that is part of the personal aspect, and institutional
28:35
part of it has several facets.
28:44
There isn’t anybody who’s advocating not talking to one another,
28:51
but again, there still is to some extent, a “publish or perish” philosophy in the
28:58
research community that hasn’t changed.
29:00
You
29:04
know, one of the things that we talked about in the national forests, is how
29:09
research and management work together.
29:11
There really are very few incentives for people to operate as the
29:14
Andrews group operates, very few incentives for researchers to get
29:18
together in a collaborative mode amongst themselves, let alone in a
29:22
collaborative mode with management.
29:26
So that is partly institutional.
29:28
Another element of the institutional
29:38
situation, is the fact that we are going to downsize to the point where we aren’t
29:46
going to have people who have time for
29:51
reading and communicating.
29:54
It is becoming more and more difficult during a time when it’s
29:57
becoming more and more critical.
29:58
Here on
30:03
the Chippewa, we’ve lost twenty five percent of our employees.
30:08
We obviously do not have the same amount of time to coordinate, for
30:12
example, the meeting I had last month with researchers in Grand Rapids,
30:16
in which I had a lot of interest.
30:18
I had
30:22
many fewer takers than I had people interested, just because
30:25
of the press of business.
30:26
I mean, we’ve got forest planning going on, we’ve got all the other things
30:29
going on, and people are saying, “God, I wish I could make it but I just
30:34
can’t.” That’s the situation we’re in, and it’s not like the institution
30:39
is driving that, but the framework of the institution is, funding-wise.
30:46
That makes it much more difficult.
30:47
And again, during a time where it is becoming more and more political.
30:51
The debates and controversy over resource management are
30:55
becoming more intense everywhere.
30:58
Things are starting to pop out here in Minnesota that we
31:00
hadn’t dealt with in the past.
31:02
And as those things pop out, the importance of research and management
31:07
being together, working together in the collaborative mode, are more and more
31:11
important because of the credibility I talked about earlier; the synergistic
31:14
credibility we have with research and management being on the same page.
31:20
You have to have that in order to effectively answer the critics.
31:29
We have an awful lot of critics who,
31:33
well, their criticisms are “out-to-lunch” from my perspective. They’re posturing,
31:43
but in order to deal with those kinds of criticisms, you
31:48
have to have sound research
31:57
and management.
31:59
Yeah, Lynn Burditt [Blue River Ranger] said they cut back from, I
32:03
think it’s down to 440 employees,
32:07
from 750 or something [Willamette National Forest]
32:13
. Well, they still got 440, we’ve got 120, and we’re harvesting about the same amount
32:19
on this forest [HJA/adjacent region] as the Willamette [as a whole] . So,
32:24
there are more complexities on the Willamette than we have here, but
32:27
not enough to justify three times or four times the number of employees.
32:31
So, I mean that’s the kind of difficulties we are facing.
32:35
That brings me my next question.
32:37
It has to do with issues of
32:41
the relevance of the work done at the H.J. Andrews compared to
32:46
your work here in the Midwest.
32:51
How well does what’s being done on the Andrews extrapolate to
32:54
other regions, other forests
32:59
than the Willamette?
33:01
The same kinds of questions, the same kinds of general relationships that
33:06
are being dealt with on the Andrews, apply in any forested ecosystem.
33:12
I’ve had
33:15
the good fortune to be able to travel around to different parts of the world.
33:22
Also, in other studies and readings and those kinds of things, I think
33:28
some of the same basic ecosystem elements that we talked about,
33:32
coarse woody debris, fragmentation,
33:37
standing dead and live trees as legacy to the next generation of
33:40
forest, and all kinds of stuff; I don’t know of any forested
33:45
ecosystem where that doesn’t apply.
33:47
Those same elements and general principles, now obviously, you’re
33:51
talking about different magnitudes.
33:53
You’re talking about different
33:57
decomposition rates, you’re talking about different species, you’re talking about
34:00
all kinds of different ramifications.
34:03
But those general overriding principles apply.
34:06
I mean, you’re not going to find any forest where
34:10
it doesn’t have some kind of disturbance regime, doesn’t have
34:12
some kind of coarse woody debris
34:18
at some time in the cycle.
34:19
You are not going to find any kind of an aquatic ecosystem that doesn’t have some
34:23
kind of coarse woody debris element to it,
34:32
you know, those kinds of things.
34:32
That kind of worked, I mean, folks like Mark Harmon are tied
34:37
into the international network dealing with log decomposition.
34:42
He was and I’m sure, he still is.
34:45
They are looking for partner sites all over the world for dealing with
34:54
these kinds of things.
34:55
I could not take the Blue River coarse woody debris guidelines
35:00
and say we’re going to apply them here on the Chippewa Forest.
35:03
That wouldn’t make any sense.
35:04
It is a totally different context here.
35:07
But I could take the principles of the coarse woody debris guidelines of
35:11
the Blue River, and say, “We need to develop something like that here.” And
35:15
I mean, you know, we have class one, two, three, four and five logs here
35:19
on the Chippewa, just like out there.
35:21
But they’re different species, they have different decomposition rates,
35:24
there’s a different sort of context here.
35:29
But the principles all apply.
35:32
Regarding forest fragmentation
35:37
here on the Chippewa, we have begun to implement large patch cutting.
35:45
We’ve done some ecosystem studies here in an area where we found that the
35:49
natural disturbance pattern was very large patches related to fire, so we’re
35:55
beginning to harvest six and seven hundred acre areas, which means we are
36:00
saving larger patches in other areas.
36:04
Same principles, different species, different context, but same principles
36:08
in terms of disturbance patterns.
36:13
The relevance is that the Andrews,
36:18
on a number of different facets, it has been on the cutting edge
36:24
of asking different kinds of questions about forest ecosystems.
36:30
That has people reading and
36:39
encouraged to ask the same kinds of questions in other forests ecosystems
36:43
because of the similarities of principles.
36:46
The
36:50
kinds of things that Tim Schowalter was finding out about insects
36:54
in the old-growth stands of the Andrews, can drive people to ask the
36:58
same kinds of questions about the kinds of insects and the kinds of
37:01
relationships, in a forest back here.
37:05
The species are different, the answers are going to be a little
37:07
bit different, but the relevance of understanding that particular piece of
37:11
the ecosystem is just as important here.
37:19
The only
37:21
question I wanted to deal with regards a session on Lookout Creek
37:27
with a number of people who had been there for a long period of time.
37:31
And we were talking about just the general concept of long-term
37:34
research and what that entailed.
37:36
I was curious from a forest manager’s standpoint, what some
37:42
of the benefits and setbacks might be for ongoing long-term research?
37:46
You mentioned that you have studies here going back to the
37:52
50’s.
37:52
Well, long-term research provides historical contact.
37:55
There are some things you can find out in a short period of time, and
38:00
there are other things you can’t.
38:01
Obviously, the whole premise of log decomposition was looking at what
38:07
happens over a long period of time.
38:10
Now, as I mentioned earlier, there are some things they’ve began finding out with
38:15
in the first year, the second year, the first five years, of log decomp study.
38:20
They found out some amazing things.
38:22
But there is some other stuff that they won’t know the answers to, for
38:26
fifty, one hundred, two hundred years, because some logs last that long in
38:31
the forest, so you can’t answer that question until that period of time.
38:38
But they were finding out things in the first couple of years that you
38:42
can project ahead to make some best guesses about what probably will
38:52
happen.
38:54
The other part of long-term research we’re finding here on the
38:59
Chippewa, is that there is some stuff that was done forty years ago,
39:06
that,
39:10
we’ve kind of gone full-cycle.
39:11
We’ve made some changes, we’ve come back to the point of what
39:14
they were talking about then, and what is actually relevant today.
39:18
And
39:21
they’ve got answers for some of the things we would like to pursue.
39:25
It is not that in the intervening years, people were either dumb or not paying
39:34
attention to what happened before.
39:35
There were just different philosophies and for some, the philosophical
39:42
focus has come full circle.
39:46
So
39:48
personally, I have
39:51
a high level of support for long-term,
39:56
theoretical research, and some of the long-term practical research
40:05
or even basic research, and also have high levels of support for
40:07
short-term theoretical research and practical research, but long-term
40:11
certainly has a strong role.
40:13
We just need to do that and the difficulty is getting people to commit to long-term.
40:21
Chris Maser has talked about the western mentality of not having a long-term
40:26
focus, but a short-term focus, usually a year or so, or one based on profit;
40:31
what do we gain from what we are doing today, rather than looking at the
40:36
implications and gains in the long run.
40:39
And we need to take that into account, and understand that we can’t learn everything
40:44
there is to know in the short-run.
40:45
It’s not all short-term focus, and it shouldn’t be.
40:52
One of the questions they respond to is the question of
40:55
viability of long-term research.
40:59
Roy Silen and Mike Kerrick and others talked about the phenoma at the Andrews
41:05
where research has been carried on the same studies, or same measurement period
41:08
over a long period of time, but Roy and some other people have the studied
41:12
opinion that long-term research can’t survive the life of the researcher,
41:16
or in other words, the personal passion that you talked about earlier.
41:21
To some extent that’s evident on some of the work that was done
41:27
back in the ‘50’s by Bob Buckman.
41:29
When he left, there wasn’t anyone to carry it on, you know, that had
41:33
burning for that kind of research.
41:37
But on the other hand, the fact that he did it for then, and the fact that we now
41:42
have people again with passion for the same interest, maybe there is a missing
41:47
link in between, but some of the work he did then, you can pick up on it again.
41:53
So, yeah, Mark Harmon, ain’t going to live 200 years, so who’s going to take
41:58
on the log decomp study when he’s gone?
42:01
Who’s going to have the passion for it?
42:03
I don’t know, but I would say that nothing has been lost during this time period that
42:12
Mark has been carrying out log decomp.
42:14
Just because he’s not going to be around, and maybe nobody will carry it forward.
42:18
If that is the case, so be it.
42:22
Take a look at how much has been gained in the interim.
42:26
Again, I’m just fascinated by all the information that they’ve
42:31
found out in the first few years.
42:33
And obviously, they’ve found out a lot of stuff since then
42:35
that I’m not even aware of.
42:36
I’d probably be dumbfounded,
42:40
does that mean if Mark isn’t around, all of that has been lost.
42:47
Hopefully, what will happen is that somebody will be inspired by what he’s
42:50
found out, what he and others have found out in the first few years, and
42:54
somebody will grab onto a piece of that and run with it, and continue on.
42:59
Do you think,
43:02
one of the things I’m getting at here is, is there anything in the structure of the
43:06
Forest Service, the institutional culture of the Forest Service, that would either
43:10
continue or halt the long-term research?
43:19
I don’t know.
43:20
I think researchers in general have more of a tolerance for
43:26
the long- term viewpoint than western society in general, at
43:31
least that has been my experience.
43:34
People are willing to take a little longer look at it.
43:40
In fact, if anything, there’s more of a reluctance to make any
43:49
short-term
43:54
guesses or pronouncements based on what has been learned, than
43:59
there is to wait for more data.
44:01
I think that’s the traditional outlook and
44:06
research.
44:09
I think the Andrews group is probably a little less predisposed
44:14
to that approach than other groups,
44:19
but I think, in general,
44:23
my experience with researchers has been, “Geez, I don’t know; I think I have to
44:26
wait a few more years before I really say what I’ve learned.” Although, I
44:34
think to some extent, that has maybe changed a little bit, too. I don’t know
44:39
if there is anything institutional.
44:47
It’s a tough question for me.
44:49
I don’t know if I have that perspective.
44:51
I don’t see anything institutional that would be opposed to
44:57
the long-term viewpoint.
44:59
The long-term research other than, one of the issues that we are
45:04
getting into now days is funding.
45:10
That is
45:13
one of the unhealthier things I see coming, and it has sort of
45:19
shown its head recently, and is
45:26
voiced by some people in in Congress, and also I think some people in
45:32
industry, is that if you can’t show immediate results – don’t fund it.
45:39
That kind of utilitarian view of research, if you will, if
45:48
you can’t from your research show what the implications are on timber yield next
45:53
year, then forget it, we don’t want it.
45:58
I think there’s a little bit of that element out there,
46:04
which I think is very unhealthy.
46:05
I
46:09
wanted to give you an opportunity if you had anything else
46:12
you wanted to pitch in here.
46:14
I’ve kind of held you up against the wall here for three hours.
46:17
No, I feel like I’ve totally rambled on.
46:21
I don’t know if there is anything else I could say right now.
46:23
We should probably end it then.
46:24
You’ve been real helpful.
