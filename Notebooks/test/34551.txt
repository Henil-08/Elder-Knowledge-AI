00:22
Actually, what I'd like to start off with is some of the things
00:25
you were just kind of suggesting on our way up here in the car.
00:30
I noticed you mentioned other places that you started thinking about forestry when
00:33
you were nine years old living in Camas.
00:42
What led you into forestry and ecology?
00:47
Actually, this was really the place where it started, right
00:50
here at the Mineral Springs, in
00:55
1945, when the war was coming to an end.
00:58
Our family finally got a car and we started going out and
01:02
camping during the summer.
01:04
This was the first place we came at the time [Wind River Experimental Forest
01:06
and region in southern Washington] . We came here many, many times.
01:09
So, this is where it all began for me far as an interest in
01:15
trees and forests is concerned.
01:20
Basically,
01:24
it was very apparent to me that’s what I wanted to be involved in just about as
01:28
soon as I knew that sort of thing existed.
01:33
Dad just basically enjoyed being in the woods.
01:38
My Dad enjoyed being in the woods.
01:41
Your dad was a mill worker, is that right?
01:42
He was a mill worker at the paper mill at Camas.
01:46
He worked out at the log farm, initially, where the logs came
01:51
in.
01:51
He was a fisherman and he was a hunter.
01:53
Uh-huh.
01:53
So,
02:02
it just seemed like what I wanted to do.
02:07
Uh-huh.
02:07
I don’t remember even having to think about it very much.
02:10
One interesting thing of the people I’ve talked to so far; you’re the first
02:12
person whose really grew up in this area.
02:16
Can you talk a little bit about your academic background.
02:20
So you went to WSU.
02:21
Was that undergraduate or
02:23
--? -- I went to a junior college my freshman year, then went to Washington State
02:29
University in my sophomore year.
02:34
I did well in a variety of subjects, even though I'd come to think
02:40
I wanted to go into forestry.
02:44
I got distracted, as people often do.
02:47
But, then in my junior year, I went to Oregon State University and settled down,
02:54
got my B.S. at Oregon State in '59, my Masters in Forest
02:58
Management at Oregon State in '61,
03:02
then went to Pullman for a Ph.D., which I got in 1966.
03:09
That was in botany, rather than in forestry.
03:28
Were there people who kind of guided you along your career path in that period?
03:36
Well, there really were.
03:38
There were guys all along there.
03:40
There was a botany professor at Clark College where I went my first year,
03:47
by the name of Anikka Honnick, who was literally very encouraging,
03:52
and later became a collaborator with me in some of my research.
03:57
And then the person at Oregon State who was really key was Bill Ferrell.
04:03
Okay.
04:06
Bill was the one that advised me to go to Washington State instead of doing
04:12
what I had planned, which was to go to University of Washington, in forestry.
04:17
Bill was always a very influential person.
04:19
He was also the person that made the connection between the Forest Service
04:23
and the Coop-Ed program, or Student Trainee program as they called it then.
04:29
What was the rationale for WSU over University of Washington at that point?
04:32
Well, the interesting thing was, Professor Daubenmire was up in Pullman, and he was
04:42
an outstanding community ecologist and forest ecologist,
04:48
and they had an outstanding department at Washington State.
04:52
It might be good for you to do something other than a forestry
04:57
school, because you've done forestry and you've got two degrees in it.
05:01
He [Ferrell] just said, "You know, got a good program up there in ecology and
05:05
soils, maybe you better look at it."
05:08
Hmm.
05:08
And I did, and made my decision to do that.
05:12
Did you work with Daubenmire when you were up there?
05:13
Yeah, he was my major professor.
05:15
Okay.
05:19
You said that Bill Ferrell helped link you up with the Forest Service?
05:23
Yes, it
05:26
was my third year at the university and my first year at Oregon State.
05:33
I had a couple of classes the fall of '56 and the winter of '57.
05:42
And, he heard that they were looking for a student, and he had me in his fall class.
05:51
They were looking for a student that might be interested in a career in research.
05:57
So, Bill suggested me to them and they contacted me, and I was interested.
06:05
It was a real risk for me, because the government didn't pay very well in
06:12
those days, and I was totally dependent on my own resources for school.
06:19
I had been working at Crown Zellerbach at the paper mill and making,
06:22
probably, three times as much money as I could working for the government.
06:26
But I decided I'll take the risk and hope I get a scholarship the next year.
06:31
Which I did.
06:34
You were working at Crown Zellerbach here in Oregon?
06:36
No.
06:36
Camas [Washington, north side of Columbia River]
06:38
. Oh, okay.
06:38
I'd work there in summer , and then I'd come home on weekends
06:41
and work two or three shifts.
06:48
When you got to the Forest Service,
06:52
did you start working at the PNW Station directly?
07:00
I think I went to work for them, must have been December of 1956
07:07
or January of 1957, I'm not sure.
07:11
You know, it was right in that time, and it was either January
07:15
or February of 1957, that I made my first trip down to the Andrews.
07:21
I went along with people that were checking the gauging stations and
07:24
just to get familiar with the place.
07:27
Who was there at the time?
07:28
Who was working at the time?
07:30
Who did you go down there with?
07:32
I don't remember who I went down with at the time.
07:37
Bob Ruth was the head of the research unit there in Corvallis [Willamette Research
07:42
Center] . Bob was the one who hired me.
07:44
Carl Berntsen was
07:49
working at the Andrews at that time, but they just hired Jack Rothacher.
07:55
I think I probably went down there with either Carl or some
08:00
other temporary from Corvallis, because I think Jack was down there
08:09
[H.J. Andrews] . I don't remember who I went down there with, but that summer
08:12
was Jack Rothacher’s first summer in charge of the Andrews, and so I
08:17
worked for Jack that summer of 1957.
08:19
What were your impressions of the Andrews that first meeting?
08:27
Oh, wow, it was neat.
08:29
I hadn't seen much old growth in the Oregon Cascades up until then.
08:36
I had always been up here [Washington] , and so it was a little different
08:39
kind of forest, and to compare the Washington old growth and the Oregon
08:45
old growth, you get a sense for that.
08:49
It was just neat.
08:52
It was pretty remote at that time.
08:54
Hadn't been as much cutting.
08:57
We went in on snowshoes.
08:58
I think that’s the first time I've ever been on snowshoes.
09:03
So, it was an exhilarating experience.
09:06
Uh-huh.
09:08
The summer was my first real summer.
09:14
I’d worked on a fire crew for a couple of years, a forest
09:18
fire crew, but as a youngster.
09:21
It was my first real experience working regularly in the big
09:26
woods, a lot of time on my own.
09:29
I did a lot of backpacking on weekends.
09:34
Did you have a long-range career goal at that point,
09:39
what
09:42
you wanted to do?
09:45
Well, I think by that time I sort of decided I did want to work on research.
09:50
Hmm.
09:52
I kind of developed a long-term career goal.
09:57
You talked about this briefly earlier, but what was the turning
10:00
point from being a park ranger?
10:04
I wanted to be in forestry, but at various times I was pretty wide
10:09
open to what that was going to mean.
10:11
I'd even thought about forest products at times, being from a pulp and paper
10:15
town, I was kind of interested in that.
10:18
But the ranger’s job is what everyone always thinks about, but by that time I'd
10:24
become considerably more sophisticated, and it was clear that if you were a
10:29
researcher, you really had an opportunity to do a lot of interesting things.
10:36
I think it was becoming pretty clear by then that this was a good track for me.
10:46
And did you have advisors pushing you in that direction?
10:48
Well, I guess so in a way.
10:52
Bill Ferrell, again, was a significant influence in that process.
10:57
Once I got hooked into the PNW research program, there were a lot of people
11:01
around that sort of influenced me.
11:01
I saw what they were
11:05
doing, it was exciting, it was interesting, and not as structured.
11:12
I didn't know it then, but I really preferred a less structured situation.
11:17
I like freedom.
11:18
I like options.
11:19
What kind of projects were you working on at that time?
11:23
Well,
11:28
when I first started out I was just, you know, a grunt.
11:30
Mostly I
11:34
was working on the Watershed Research [PNW] program that summer , and the
11:38
first big job of the summer was to run
11:44
the boundary surveys on Watersheds 1, 2, and 3.
11:46
Uh-huh.
11:47
Staff compassing, chains.
11:50
I was the junior member of the crew, and another summer technician and I did that.
11:57
I did the regular servicing of the gauging stations every
12:01
month, and some maintenance.
12:03
Jack
12:08
Rothacher designed an interception study, and I did basically all
12:11
the work in installing that that
13:31
summer.
13:32
I worked mostly on the watershed research program.
13:37
They also had me start my first research project, which was to develop
13:46
a guide for identifying tree seedlings.
13:50
Who put you up to that?
13:51
Well, they sort of made that a part of a student training program.
13:56
Okay.
13:56
The trainees should have their own research project that they
14:00
sort of design and carry out.
14:06
Then, the next summer I got assigned to Cascade Head Experimental Forest
14:11
working on the Timber Management Research Program at Cascade Head.
14:15
Now, I wasn't very happy about that.
14:17
I wanted to go back to the Andrews.
14:21
What was the difference between the Cascade Head and the Andrews?
14:25
The Andrews program at that point had transitioned mostly
14:28
under watershed research.
14:32
Roy Silen was finishing up his regeneration studies, and still a
14:36
little bit of field work was going on.
14:40
He had some other people to help him with that.
14:43
Carl Berntsen had been doing a little bit of work down on the Andrews on
14:47
regeneration, but basically watershed research was the big game at the Andrews.
14:53
The Cascade Head Experimental Forest was all timber management research.
14:57
Cutting methods, regeneration,
15:04
spruce-hemlock type, a different forest type.
15:10
I didn't mind the timber management research, but I've always
15:13
liked the Cascadian environment better than the coastal one.
15:13
The guy I worked for at Cascade Head
15:18
was kind of an old, he wasn't old, he was a young curmudgeon
15:23
[laughter], so it wasn't near as much fun as working for Jack.
15:28
Okay.
15:28
That was the summer of '58, and then, I graduated in '59.
15:35
They put me on right away.
15:36
I was suppose to go back to Cascade Head, but Carl Berntsen moved to Bend.
15:41
Hmm.
15:42
So they gave me Carl's job, and Carl had the responsibility for
15:47
timber management research on the Andrews Experimental Forest.
15:49
I
15:52
began to take responsibilities down there.
15:56
I was based in Corvallis instead of the Andrews.
15:58
Did you maintain pretty close ties with Oregon State University while you were?
16:06
Uh-huh.
16:07
Under Chet?
16:07
I also started in a little master’s program and took over Roy Silen’s,
16:16
didn't take it over.
16:18
Roy had cut some odd harvest units from the Andrews, back in '52, '53, '54,
16:26
some strips, small groups, seed trees,
16:32
for which he took a lot of shit from the region.
16:35
But anyway, he'd done it, so what I did was decided to do a regeneration
16:41
study of those units for my masters.
16:46
I worked on that in summers.
16:57
I might have been working on that already in summer of '59, but,
17:01
probably, mostly, in the summer of '60.
17:03
Okay.
17:03
At any rate, Carl leaving as I graduated gave me a position in Corvallis
17:10
which had Andrews responsibility.
17:15
I see.
17:17
That's about a year or two before Ted Dyrness was down there.
17:20
Did you know Ted at OSU at that time?
17:22
I met him, I think.
17:24
Somewhere along the way we encountered each other, but
17:26
fundamentally, I didn't know
17:32
him.
17:33
Your perception of the Andrews in the period of '58 to '63; what did you
17:39
think of that in terms of the people working on the site, and especially
17:42
the infrastructure and facilities?
17:45
There were no facilities.
17:47
Well, I shouldn't say that.
17:49
In '59, '60, '61, we had a small office in the basement of the ranger
18:01
station [Blue River] . And we had a residence [also in Blue River] , which
18:06
was where Jack Rothacher lived.
18:09
Then the summer of '59, in the middle of the summer, we got a house trailer, which
18:15
we put on the Forest Service compound.
18:22
I initiated that trailer house.
18:27
Ted and I used that for many years after that.
18:32
You probably had some local interaction with the people at
18:36
the ranger station at that time.
18:37
Did you work with them much at all?
18:40
Well, I didn't have a lot of interaction with the rangers.
18:44
I guess I had some.
18:48
I typically had interactions with timber sales officers because I was involved
18:54
at that point in the preparation of the sales programs for the Andrews, and
18:59
then helping to design a timber sale.
19:11
Then I was, of course, a liaison with the timber sales officers that
19:15
were administering the timber sales.
19:18
I worked quite a bit with the district people.
19:23
I kind of almost forgot about that.
19:30
That was a significant part of my job also; to help
19:38
basically prescribe the regeneration treatment that was going to go on.
19:43
At that point, we still had a very significant timber
19:47
sale program on the Andrews.
19:49
The philosophy was that the sooner we could bring the Andrews under
19:55
complete management, the better.
19:59
And, the whole mission was that a really good experimental forest
20:05
would be state-of-the-art in terms of whatever the current art was.
20:13
Hmm.
20:14
We kind of believed that strategy.
20:15
What you do is to use up all your options.
20:17
You commit yourself to whatever’s popular at the moment.
20:21
In any case, that would be the intent for both Cascade Head and Andrews;
20:26
to bring it all under management.
20:29
So, we were still over-cutting a lot, not really for experimental purposes, but
20:35
just to convert stands and to build roads.
20:41
Most of the timber sales in that period were sales that Carl had developed,
20:47
and worked with the district on.
20:49
I was just doing the follow through, but it was at that time, for example,
20:55
around '60, '61, '62, when the road got punched all the way up
21:01
Lookout Creek, up to Frissell Point.
21:06
The road also got punched up to Carpenter Saddle.
21:10
So, we were still doing a tremendous amount of road-building and
21:15
timber cutting at that point.
21:18
So your role with the ranger station can be written as adjusting prescriptions
21:25
and things for regeneration.
21:27
Was that mainly for land on the Andrews, or was that what they
21:30
did in the district in general?
21:31
That was for Andrews.
21:34
Okay.
21:34
We had no jurisdiction at all,
21:39
no significant involvement, outside the Andrews.
21:42
It was pretty heavy duty,
21:48
go-for-broke management.
21:51
They weren't much interested in research.
21:54
In fact, periodically, this particular McKenzie District would do something
22:01
on the Andrews Experimental Forest without even clearing it with
22:06
us.
22:06
They had the backside.
22:10
They had the ridge on the south side of Lookout Ridge.
22:16
If you think of the Andrews as a triangle, the McKenzie Bridge District had the land
22:22
that bordered the Andrews on two sides of that triangle [Other area – Blue River
22:27
District] . They could put up a timber sale and build a railroad there up and
22:30
drop it down on the Andrews side, and we wouldn't know about it until it happened.
22:40
Who was in charge of the district at that time?
22:42
Oh, I don't remember.
22:44
There were probably several people in charge.
22:46
One of the people who was in charge of McKenzie Bridge District during
22:50
that time was Mike [Loadman?] . Mike was a pretty hard core, go-for-broke
22:55
kind of guy, who did pretty much what he damned pleased on the district.
23:01
So, anyway, we had a number of cases where there were cut-ins done up high
23:06
,that we would rather not have had done, but they were sort of almost fait
23:15
accompli.
23:15
As far as you can recall, the district didn’t pose questions for you to
23:18
try and solve or anything up there?
23:20
No, they really didn't.
23:22
The district wasn't very intimately involved in the
23:25
research program in those days.
23:27
They weren't very interested in it.
23:29
To a degree there was involvement, it tended to be at the regional office level.
23:36
If you got discussions at all between research and management,
23:39
it tended to be at that level.
23:42
Okay.
23:43
Occasionally at mid-level, but almost never at the district level.
23:50
But you had to work with people at the district level to do your activity.
23:54
Mmm.
23:55
So, you worked with them a lot in actual implementation.
24:01
How about interaction with people in Blue River, the community on the river.
24:05
When you went up there, did you pretty much stay on the trailer site,
24:09
or did you go down to the river?
24:10
At the start of the summer we were at the CCC work center where the McKenzie
24:18
Bridge Ranger Station is today.
24:26
The first half of that summer, I stayed in that work center because
24:29
we had no living facilities in
24:33
Blue River.
24:34
When I moved to Blue River, I lived in the trailer, and I
24:36
pretty much stayed with that.
24:39
There were some district trailers; it was sort of a trailer park.
24:44
Uh-huh.
24:45
We called it “West Blue River Heights.” We
24:50
certainly had contact with the district people.
24:54
Not as many as I had when I was working out at the work center in McKenzie
24:58
Bridge, because there you had a lot of contact with other seasonals who
25:04
were there, people who were going to be lookouts, for example, and
25:09
were going through their training.
25:12
You
25:15
interacted with other district people there, but once you got
25:19
into the trailers, unless your work brought you together, you didn't.
25:24
I didn't drink, and so I didn't go down to the bars, pool room, or
25:30
anything like that, to hang out.
25:31
And your family was up
25:40
in Corvallis?
25:40
Actually, I got married in '58, and my family lived in Corvallis at that point.
25:43
I'd go down there for
25:47
maybe a week at a time.
25:50
More often, two or three days at
25:55
a time.
25:55
You were talking earlier about
25:58
what standard perceptions of experimental forests doing whatever
26:00
was state-of-the-art at the time.
26:04
Was that your perception of what they were for?
26:08
No, that was pretty well-stated.
26:10
The whole notion was that an experimental forest ought to
26:20
be a full-fledged representation of our ideal for the national forest.
26:27
It should be a fully regulated forest
26:33
with a range of stands of many stands with different ages.
26:38
Should all be accessible by road.
26:42
And there was no attempt at that time of reserving any part of the forest
26:48
other than the control watershed.
26:50
Okay.
26:51
The notion was, the sooner you get this area roaded and converted,
26:59
the sooner you would have the kinds of stands you really wanted to do
27:03
research on, which were managed stands.
27:06
Mmm.
27:10
I'm almost sure that's gotta be written down in a variety of places.
27:14
If you want to get some insight, what you need to do is look
27:19
at some of the inspections.
27:22
We had constant inspections from forest and office people who would come out.
27:30
There were general functional inspections and general regional inspections.
27:37
There would be people coming out to review the entire research program.
27:42
There would be people who came out to review the timber
27:46
management research program.
27:49
There were constant reviews and assessments going on, and
27:51
every one of those generated some kind of inspection report.
27:57
Those really give you insight into what was going on, what people were
28:01
thinking, what the pressures were, what were people being pushed to do.
28:08
And those inspection reports would have represented the most
28:11
progressive thinking at the time.
28:18
Some of those spoke to the importance of getting these areas regulated.
28:21
We knew what we were doing.
28:23
Theoretically, you weren't suppose to be cutting on experimental forests unless
28:28
it was for scientific purposes, but we were all so anxious to get these areas
28:36
under management that we basically said, "Hey, even though we’re not doing actual
28:42
studies of this, we’re setting ourselves up for them, for the research program."
28:50
So, most of the timber harvest on the Andrews was not associated with specific
28:56
research projects, but instead, creating a particular scenario, a management
29:05
situation for subsequent research.
29:09
I was wondering, at that time for you and some people you were working
29:12
with, did all this make sense to you?
29:13
It made sense.
29:18
No, that is, it made sense to me.
29:21
I bought into it.
29:24
I don't know at what point I stopped buying into it, but certainly for
29:27
the first two, three, or four years of my career, I bought into it.
29:33
I wasn't as regressive about it as some others were in a sense that
29:38
I probably would’ve had a little bit of that feeling of, well, I’d
29:41
better go slow on some of this.
29:44
But, at that point, I didn't see where there was going
29:50
to be any old growth saved.
29:53
And I certainly didn't see any interest at all in research on old growth.
29:59
It was very clear: the Forest Service wasn't going to put any
30:03
money into old-growth research other than, coincidentally, as a
30:07
part of watershed research program.
30:11
Uh-huh.
30:12
You needed a controlled watershed to compare with, and one, two,
30:17
three months to work on trees.
30:19
So, I saw the future for Forest Service research as being
30:24
manipulating things of various kinds.
30:28
And, my preservation energies went into the Research Natural Area Program.
30:38
The Forest Service has this program to set aside examples of different
30:41
kinds of forest conditions.
30:46
I put a lot of effort into that beginning, probably '62,
30:51
’63, I began to get involved.
30:52
The first place I got involved in was right here in this district.
30:59
At least, we can save some good examples of these different forest conditions.
31:04
So, through most of the sixties I put a lot of energy into the natural area
31:11
program, which became to be called the Research Natural Area Program.
31:17
In theory at least, I thought it provided an opportunity to preserve
31:21
some good examples of different kinds of forests and habitats.
31:27
Did you work with any involvement in identifying areas that would fit
31:31
-- ? -- Right.
31:32
First, I started by just being one participant of a variety of
31:37
people that were identifying areas.
31:47
What evolved during the sixties, was more and more of my effort going into
31:53
that kind of activity, and an increasing level of sophistication as I discovered
32:00
what the objections were going to be.
32:05
What kind of problems were you running into?
32:06
Well, with John Williams, from timber management, this was a really big issue.
32:13
You know, research natural areas were withdrawn from
32:20
the allowable cut?
32:21
And National Forest people also didn't like them because they set aside
32:27
lands that took away their options.
32:29
Even if they didn't have in mind the timber sale program, it was a lock-up
32:34
that they then had no flexibility with.
32:37
Plus, they shared management responsibility with the
32:41
research station [PNW] on it.
32:42
So, they gave up jurisdiction and options and often allowable cut.
32:49
So, they didn't like them at all.
32:52
The majority of the National Forest people were not enthusiastic
32:55
supporters of the Natural Area Program.
32:57
But, there was enough leadership in the station and in the region
33:01
[Region 6, the regional office of the National Forest system] and in
33:01
the concept that it provided space for people like me to begin to work.
33:10
What we essentially, eventually did was develop a comprehensive
33:15
plan for natural areas.
33:17
It turned out that it wasn't completed until '73, but the roots of it
33:22
were in the last half of the ‘60s.
33:25
But we realized, “Jesus, they keep asking us again and again, why do you
33:30
need a Douglas-fir natural area? Why do you need a Lodgepole Pine RNA? How
33:33
many of these damn things do you need?!” So, it became obvious that what we need
33:39
to do is develop a comprehensive list.
33:51
You realized it so much that you needed to define the big picture, and
33:57
basically the people above were not quite that ready to take that baby on.
34:02
Well, late sixties was a process of conditioning people to think
34:07
about a much more comprehensive list of what was needed.
34:12
That culminated in a workshop, in I think '73, where we developed
34:18
the first natural area needs list.
34:21
The first natural area
34:25
campaign was then.
34:25
We’d done some iterations of that kind of activity earlier in simpler
34:29
form, by, it must have been by '67, or had something like that.
34:36
It changed the chemistry, because then all you had to do was say, “Well
34:42
look, we need one of these, or we need one of this kind of things
34:47
in this area.” And once you had that and it had the imprimature of
34:52
authority, the rangers agreed with us.
34:56
Then, the first line of objections was off the table.
34:59
And then it became a matter, "Why this area and not this area?” Or "Why do you
35:07
need 1200 acres?” “Why can't you do it with 400 acres?" So, it changed the terms
35:14
of the negotiation process so that you didn't get hit first of all with, "You
35:19
guys justify this sucker for me." So, you had to sort of make a plan to justify it.
35:26
Did you find certain strategies worked better for getting your argument across?
35:30
I mean, did you identify that particular stand or did you find yourself
35:33
selecting stands that you thought there would be less objection to?
35:35
No.
35:35
I never worked that way.
35:37
I always went for the very best.
35:40
And I got into some real
35:45
touchy issues.
35:46
Probably one of the earliest and
35:52
perhaps one of my most important lessons in the process, was the struggle over the
35:57
Wildcat Mountain Research Natural Area.
35:59
Hmm.
36:01
And it became ultimately a struggle between the forest supervisor and myself.
36:07
He did not want it there.
36:09
He wanted it some other place, and he wanted it small.
36:11
Do
36:15
you recall who that was?
36:16
Oh yeah, Paul Sumpter is his name.
36:20
He was the supervisor of the Willamette [NF] through much of the sixties.
36:20
I have a bad time with name recall these days.
36:21
That's okay.
36:21
He was
36:30
the
36:33
supervisor on the Willamette.
36:34
He was the supervisor of the Willamette in the early ‘60s, and
36:37
I think perhaps most of the ‘60s.
36:41
I originally identified this area as a good natural area candidate for noble
36:47
fir, and the district and the forest asked, "Well, rather than you proposing
36:52
it, why don't you let us propose it so that we can be good guys--my
36:56
guys." So, okay, here's the material.
37:00
And I waited and I waited and lo-and-behold, about a year-and-a-half
37:07
later came a timber sale advertisement that included part of this
37:11
proposed research natural area.
37:13
I went ballistic, and just stirred up an awful fuss about this.
37:22
They almost pulled the timber sale, but didn't.
37:25
The regional forestry [office] didn't pull the timber sale, but clearly I got the
37:31
district and forest both caught a little bit crosswise with the regional office.
37:37
They didn't like that at all.
37:44
They had me work with the forest to try to find alternatives for Wildcat.
37:50
Basically, I managed to talk
37:55
rationales as to why this is the one we really needed, and persuaded the
37:59
forest staff to work with me on that.
38:03
But the forest supervisor still wouldn't buy off on it, and finally the regional
38:09
forester and the research station director and the whole Natural Area
38:13
Committee came down to Wildcat Mountain, flew in a helicopter all around it,
38:17
landed on top of Wildcat Mountain.
38:18
I still remember the timber management staff getting out at the top, a
38:23
guy by the name of Glenn Jorgenson, and I liked Glenn real well.
38:28
The helicopter dropped us off, we walked down off the helispot landing,
38:33
and took off to go get somebody else.
38:36
"Well, it looks pretty good to me, but I think we really don't need
38:41
that area over there." Pointed towards Bunchgrass Mountain.
38:46
[Laughter] I see what’s going to happen here.
38:49
So, I got my natural area at Wildcat Mountain, but a smaller
38:53
one than I’d originally planned.
38:54
Then one that had a harvest unit
39:00
extending into it.
39:03
But anyway.
39:05
Who were you working with on these projects at that time in your research?
39:08
Well, there was a Natural Area Committee in the Forest Service, initially that
39:18
was shared by the director of the research station [PNW] , and we had
39:23
several research station directors who really liked natural areas.
39:26
Phil Briegleb was one.
39:28
Uh-huh.
39:29
He was director part of that time.
39:32
Bob Buckman was another one, the old natural area advocate.
39:37
Then it had a number of people from the station [PNW] , and from the region
39:41
, including someone from timber management.
39:45
That committee didn't do much work, initially.
39:50
They just had enough work that they'd meet once or twice a year.
39:53
Then people like me began to get involved, and Fred Hall began to get involved.
39:59
The workload began to build and we’d meet every year,
40:03
twice a year, or every quarter.
40:05
That
40:09
committee sort of gave us the umbrella of authority that allowed us to
40:15
work, and encouraged us to do this.
40:18
So even despite the controversies, they had a committee which included those
40:24
region and station people, developed a list of natural areas that were
40:29
needed, the short list initially, and the more comprehensive one later.
40:35
Then, also during the ‘60s, this committee was broadened to
40:38
include all federal agencies.
40:40
So, we made it the Northwest Natural Area Committee, where
40:46
BLM, Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service also participated.
40:53
Those are who I worked with.
40:57
Did you work with Glen Juday, or is he later?
40:59
Glen was much later.
41:01
Okay.
41:02
Glen was much later.
41:04
He was a late arrival.
41:10
[Laughter]
41:10
With the Andrews, were there any other people up there that were
41:12
involved with the RNA projects?
41:15
Ted became very involved in the Research Natural Area Program, and
41:19
he and I did a lot of stuff together.
41:27
In the ‘70s, other people got involved, too.
41:30
In the ‘70s, I hired Art McKee.
41:34
By the early ‘70s, we had a summer natural area scientist need, where
41:38
we hired somebody for the summer, and Art was one of those people.
41:42
Oh, okay.
41:43
So, Art McKee was involved in the natural area program.
41:50
Don Zobel was involved in the natural area program.
41:53
But, by that time it was really a going operation.
41:57
It
42:06
gave me a chance to get out and get around, and to push an agenda
42:11
of setting aside good examples of each of these forest types for
42:15
research and educational purposes.
42:17
I thought that was about all I was going to be able to do
42:21
in the preservation category.
42:24
So I didn't push that kind of agenda on the experimental forest at all.
42:29
Yeah, but you were getting involved in a lot of areas outside the
42:32
experimental forest at the same time you were doing your research there.
42:34
Right.
42:36
Right.
42:36
If we could back up a little bit into the early ‘60s again, and
42:40
talk about some of the people you were working with on the Andrews.
42:43
It sounds like during your graduate, or during undergraduate years, you
42:47
didn't work that closely with them, but as of 1961 or '62, somewhere
42:51
in there, you started working more closely with them on the Andrews.
42:53
Ted?
42:54
Yes, Ted Dyrness.
42:54
Yeah, it was somewhere right in there.
42:58
Yes.
42:58
It could have been '61, could have been '62, but it was right in
43:03
there, because, let's see, by '62,
43:15
I’d started in the Fall of '62, my program
43:18
[Ph.D] at Pullman.
43:22
And I knew him by then,
43:26
and by
43:29
'64 Will Moir came down, and by '64 we were into the habitat classification
43:36
[project] for the Andrews.
43:38
We were getting into that by that time.
43:44
Can you recall what led you and Ted to start working together down there?
43:49
Did you just meet on the Andrews or did you
43:51
– ? Well, he was working down there on erosion and landslides and road stabilization.
43:59
He was working down there on watershed research projects, and
44:03
I was down there working on timber management research projects.
44:12
We ended up being together in the trailer, and we obviously had a
44:19
lot of similar kinds of viewpoints and just general inclinations.
44:25
So, we looked for opportunities to do things together because our regular
44:31
work assignments didn't do that.
44:34
Sometime in that mid-sixties period, '64 perhaps, we decided we really needed
44:41
to do a habitat-type classification for the Andrews, and we'd do it together.
44:45
I'd sample the vegetation and he'd sample the soils.
44:51
So, we had a lot of the same outlook.
44:55
He had a lot of the same kind of
44:59
forest community training that I have.
45:03
We liked working together, we could justify it.
45:07
And Jack Rothacher helped out a lot in that regard too.
45:12
Jack encouraged us to work together.
45:20
Interesting.
45:22
You mentioned that your normal assignments did not really encourage collaboration.
45:28
Maybe you could talk more about the barriers to that kind of collaboration.
45:31
Were there problems in trying to work together with someone
45:33
on a project like that?
45:35
Really, it’s just that you had to have an approved area of work.
45:40
We did a lot of
45:45
planning in terms of prioritizing research projects and research areas, so
45:56
it tended to limit your possibilities in terms of the kinds of collaborations
46:02
that you could do, and your ability to sort of follow your interests.
46:11
There wasn’t any career ladders concerns with you?
46:13
No.
46:16
Maybe there was in the early ‘60s, but by the end of the ‘60s, we had gotten into
46:20
the pure research-grid evaluation panels.
46:24
That
46:27
took a lot of power away from project leaders in terms of
46:33
controlling what people did, and certainly controlling their rewards.
46:38
It very quickly became apparent that you were going to be rewarded
46:44
salary-wise based upon your productivity.
46:47
The more stuff, more science you produced, the more publications that you had,
46:52
and also, the more significant those publications, the more freedom you were
46:57
going to have to pursue your own selection
47:03
of interests.
47:04
In that classification effort that you and Ted were working on, can you recall,
47:08
were there graduate students or assistants helping you on that, or just you and Ted?
47:11
No, it was just Ted and I.
47:16
I heard a lot of stories about people running across copies of that [habitat
47:21
classification documents of HJA] still.
47:21
Someone would
47:24
have it with marginal comments in it, but that classification
47:29
still seems to be a real standard.
47:32
The same time you're working on that, you're beginning to get
47:34
involved in the IBP, is that right?
47:39
I think the first meeting that I was involved in was
47:46
'68.
47:46
By that time, the guy I worked for, Bob Ruth, and I, had
47:49
gone through a power struggle.
47:54
Basically, I think what happened was I was looking real hard to leave the Forest
48:00
Service and go to some other place, because Bob liked to control people.
48:05
I don't like to be controlled.
48:10
I won't say anything more about Bob except that we have some
48:13
different kinds of values.
48:18
I think by '66,
48:22
'67, Bob had sort of been told, “Back off.
48:26
Let this guy do pretty much whatever he wants to do, because he is bright and it
48:31
looks like he's gonna be very productive,
48:35
so we don't want to lose him.
48:38
Give him enough space that were not gonna lose him."
48:43
So, by '68,
48:49
I had a fair amount of flexibility, and it was encouraged by the [PNW] station.
48:55
I remember going to the first meeting about the biome program [Coniferous
49:00
Forest Biome - IBP] ; I think it was in '68, it could have been in
49:02
'69, but I think it was in '68.
49:03
It was a meeting the University of Washington
49:12
had put on.
49:13
Basically, it was a workshop that they put on to bring everybody in and
49:14
tell them that they were going to have the Coniferous Forest Biome program.
49:18
So,
49:21
they were the big guys and said, “We’ve got this all under control,
49:25
and we have to talk to you people about it.” But, a group of us came
49:30
up from Corvallis, and basically
49:37
said, “We have to take some time to figure out exactly all that happened, but what we
49:41
did was high-centered this proposal for a coniferous forest biome on the basis that
49:49
we somehow gained enough leverage on the situation that there wasn't going to be a
49:56
biome program unless we were a part of it.
49:59
So we significantly derailed some of the Univeristy of Washington’s effort.
50:04
I still remember that meeting.
50:07
How did you accomplish that?
50:08
I don't remember.
50:08
I
50:11
think I would probably have to spend some time thinking about it, and sitting
50:14
down with people like Dick Waring to talk about what happened at that meeting.
50:18
Dick Waring was involved in it also?
50:19
Dick was involved in it.
50:22
Anyway, we went up to the Pack Forest to hear about the biome
50:25
program, and the big dog [Univ.
50:28
of Wash.] figured that they had it all, but one way or another, it got
50:32
high-centered, we were very interested in being involved in it and were willing
50:36
to hold it hostage if we didn't get a significant piece of the action.
50:41
So, things sputtered along.
50:44
In '69, we got our first biome grant and got a little bit of money at Oregon State.
50:49
I
50:58
was gone in '70, in Japan that year.
51:01
I came back in '71, things had been sputtering along, and NSF came out on
51:07
an inspection with the biome program.
51:10
What they really came out to do was to say, “This program isn't working.
51:15
Were going to turn it loose.” I think we knew that, and three of us got
51:22
together, Dick Waring, Dale Cole [UW] , and myself.
51:29
I don't know if we explicitly said it this way, but we sort of said, “This program
51:34
is either going to be a cooperative program between these two institutions
51:38
and we’re either going to work together, or there isn't going to be any program.
51:42
So let's go ahead and work out a modus operandi.” That was basically like
51:49
a 60/40 split, something like that.
51:55
Actually, 10-15% went to other institutions, but
52:02
the split between the two institutions [Oregon State and
52:03
Washington] was about 60/40.
52:05
So you got a larger share that you had before.
52:08
You bet that's a larger share, but this was a significant
52:12
program for us, and was to involve several hundreds of thousands of
52:18
dollars.
52:18
So, another thing that happened in the process of
52:25
the Corvallis crew elbowing their way in, was that we had to work
52:31
through what we were going to do to allow for a piece of the action.
52:35
So there was a fight at Corvallis as to whether we were going to go the
52:38
young-stand route, which was what Mike Newton and Dennis Lavender and several
52:43
people wanted to do, or whether we were going to study old growth, and
52:47
the notion of studying an old-growth watershed won out in that debate.
52:56
So, that was the beginning of the significant investment
53:00
in ecosystem research.
53:01
And in old growth, other than
53:05
watersheds.
53:06
Who's in the old-growth side with you?
53:09
Ted?
53:09
Of course, Ted was there.
53:10
When
53:15
that memorandum surfaced, that we had to dis-establish the Andrews, we
53:20
realized that ultimately there was only one way we were going to save
53:24
this place: We have to build a program.
53:28
So, when Ted and I saw the biome stuff surfacing, we really went after that
53:36
very aggressively, and we were very aggressive in the debate at Corvallis.
53:44
It didn't last long
53:48
because the bulk of the people involved did want to work with the old growth
53:52
rather than the managed stands, but there was a struggle for a period of
53:56
time about where the emphasis should be.
53:59
So there was an early interest in old-growth studies at that time, and this
54:02
is in the sixties, mid to late sixties?
54:05
Or later?
54:05
I've always been looking for ways to get money to study old growth.
54:09
I've managed to use some of the natural area interests to do that.
54:14
Well, we need to get some plots out here, and stuff like that.
54:18
Yeah, there's been an interest in it, and there wasn't any question
54:23
that a lot of the scientists involved in the initial workshop in
54:28
'68 were interested in old growth.
54:31
Were interested in natural forests.
54:34
And clearly that was what we were interested in by the time
54:38
we got our first money in '69.
54:45
Interesting how this thing got together.
54:46
You were talking about this in the car, maybe you can elaborate a little
54:49
bit more about your perceptions of the reasons that the Andrews was slated
54:53
for closure in and around that period?
54:55
Well, the Andrews had been set up for two purposes.
54:58
One was timber management research on how to convert the old-growth
55:03
forest to managed stands.
55:05
That was about harvesting methods, it was about road layouts, it was about logging
55:11
systems, it was about regeneration.
55:17
The second objective of the Andrews was to conduct watershed research, specifically,
55:22
to look at the effects of the conversion and the harvesting on water quality.
55:29
They were most concerned with the effects on stream flow.
55:35
Then they became concerned about the effects on things like water temperature.
55:39
By the time they were ready to manipulate the watershed in the early
55:43
'60s, they had become interested in nutrients as well as sediments.
55:55
By '61,
55:59
they felt they knew about all that needed to know about harvesting old growth.
56:12
By '61, the timber management research people didn't have any
56:16
interest in the Andrews anymore.
56:20
They were interested in managing young stands by that time, and had done
56:25
all they thought they needed to do on harvest systems and on regeneration.
56:29
They decided to go with artificial regeneration [planting of seedlings]
56:33
. So, timber management research had no further interest in the Andrews.
56:39
Well, dis-establish, just give it back to the national forest then.
56:43
Except for the staged watersheds which are continuing as watershed research sites.
56:51
That's exactly what happened on the South Umpqua Experimental Forest.
56:53
It was disestablished except for
56:55
- Watersheds.
56:56
The staged watersheds [Coyote Creek Experimental watersheds, 1-4]
56:59
. The IBP,
57:06
as you saw it, was to save the Andrews as a research site.
57:10
The biome
57:13
was several things to me.
57:14
First of all, and I think this was how I got into it initially, I thought, "Wow,
57:21
this is a chance to build a program at the Andrews, beause the more people
57:26
we have at the Andrews doing varied kinds of research, the more chances we
57:30
are going to have to keep this as an experimental property in the future.”
57:34
So, my initial interest was simply in building a program at the Andrews.
57:40
More people, better variety of activities, but more than
57:44
anything, just more activities.
57:47
The more research we got going, the more difficult it’s going to be for people to
57:54
come along and dis-establish the property.
57:56
To demonstrate use.
58:00
It was only after I got involved in the biome program for a while, I realized
58:04
here was also the vehicle that was going to allow me to study old-growth forests.
58:10
Hmm.
58:11
So, wow!
58:13
We're finally going to get a chance to really look at an old-growth forest.
58:17
I don't know what I want to study about it, but we're going to get a chance.
58:22
So, a lot of reasons here for going with the IBP.
58:26
It strikes me there’s something there on the Andrews that you see as
58:30
necessary to retain as a research site.
58:33
You’d obviously done work there, so you had some personal investment there.
58:37
But were there some particular characteristics about the Andrews
58:40
at that point-in-time, that you saw as really essential to keep
58:42
inside the research community, and use that as a place to build on?
58:45
It was only dedicated to old-growth, Douglas-fir forest.
58:52
That's not quite true,
58:55
because we also had the Wind River Experimental Forest, here.
58:58
But,
59:00
a large, diverse property like that dedicated to research, there ain’t many of
59:07
those around, and they're hard to come by.
59:10
And it was an extraordinary property, the first old-growth forest.
59:18
If that was once given up, the community was never ever going to be able to ever
59:24
capture another property like that again.
59:26
Uh-huh.
59:30
So my attitude towards experimental forests, and towards research
59:34
natural areas, is, once you give them up, you're odds of ever
59:39
getting them back, are minute.
59:43
You recognized at that time this was a unique resource?
59:47
Unique resource.
59:48
Absolutely.
59:49
Geier
59:57
Your focus at this point is pretty tightly on the Andrews, and
1:00:00
you've done most of your work in the Northwest until this point.
1:00:05
Had you given any thought up until this time about going and working
1:00:08
in other regions, or were you somehow committed to this area?
1:00:13
Well,
1:00:16
I don't think I ever seriously considered going to any other region.
1:00:20
If I hadn't had a job, I might have considered Alaska or the Rocky Mountains.
1:00:28
But, these are forests that I really knew and really loved and were in my roots,
1:00:34
and I saw no need to go anywhere else.
1:00:38
As long as I didn't have to go anywhere else, I damn well wasn't going to go
1:00:45
anywhere else.
1:00:45
To some extent, I still have a little bit of that attitude.
1:00:50
As I look back on my career, and I saw this decades ago, I'm
1:00:56
really, really very happy here.
1:01:01
And when I get involved in either national or international things,
1:01:06
I typically got involved because I needed to create a context in
1:01:10
which I could do what I wanted here.
1:01:14
I never actively sought responsibilities or activities at
1:01:21
the national or international level.
1:01:26
That was never my ambition.
1:01:29
But, at times, I needed to do that to create what I wanted to have here.
1:01:35
Long-term research, the LTER, is exactly an outgrowth of that.
1:01:41
You really need a mechanism to fund long-term research at the Andrews.
1:01:49
You can't do this on a grant-by-grant basis.
1:01:51
It’s gonna kill you, as sooner or later you’re gonna hit a gap and the bottom's
1:01:56
gonna fall out of your program, and you may never get it back on its feet again.
1:02:00
So, I go back to the National Science Foundation in 1973-75, and one of the
1:02:08
things I get involved in there is, “We've got to find some way to support
1:02:15
programs over longer term periods.”
1:02:22
That becomes ultimately the LTER program.
1:02:29
I believe in the value of that for everybody, but it came out of a desire
1:02:34
to have it here in the Northwest.
1:02:38
That’s an interesting point.
1:02:39
You got involved in the NSF at a cruical point for the Andrews.
1:02:44
What was the avenue of approach there?
1:02:46
I mean, did you have prior contacts?
1:02:48
No, I
1:02:51
didn't.
1:02:52
When we settled down in '71,
1:02:57
I was kind of the broker between Dale Cole and Dick Waring, between Oregon
1:03:01
State and University of Washington.
1:03:03
So, I had a pretty high profile.
1:03:07
In '71, the NSF
1:03:17
the program director at that time, asked me if I would be interested
1:03:20
in coming back there in two years.
1:03:22
What program directors did at that time was they didn't look for
1:03:26
their success, they looked for the success of the very successful.
1:03:30
So, a guy by the name of Trooper impressed with the role I had
1:03:36
played in
1:03:40
finally bringing the biome program to my authority, asked me, “Would
1:03:46
you be interested in coming back to Washington in '73?” Well, yeah.
1:03:54
I didn't really know what the job was about that much, but I figured it's a
1:04:00
pretty important place to be at that time because that's about the time
1:04:03
the IBP funding is coming to an end.
1:04:07
So, you could do a lot of service for both the Andrews and IBP--the
1:04:14
other sites, if you took that job.
1:04:17
So, I did.
1:04:19
He recruited me in '71, I went in the summer of '73.
1:04:22
The Andrews program was in pretty good hands.
1:04:28
Dick Waring was running a lot of it at that point.
1:04:35
So I went back to Washington for two years.
1:04:42
I see it partially as being done a lot to create context.
1:04:48
To influence an outcome that was going to be important to
1:04:56
the Andrews.
1:04:57
One way or another I was a part of it.
1:04:59
I don't know all of what happened, but we were able to convert the IBP
1:05:05
funding to line funding, continuous funding for ecosystem research.
1:05:11
Instead of disappearing into just regular ecology or biology funding, the line item
1:05:18
that had been there for IBP was rolled over into the ecosystem science program.
1:05:25
Which, then, was the opportunity to continue to fund sites like the Andrews,
1:05:32
and Coweeta, Hubbard Brook, and other
1:05:37
places.
1:05:37
I think part of your purpose in going back to Washington was to solidify
1:05:42
the situation with the Andrews.
1:05:43
Did you have a specific agenda at the NSF that you wanted to accomplish there?
1:05:47
Yeah, I had an agenda, and I can't remember all of what it was.
1:05:52
But one of the things, clearly, was to make sure that at the end
1:05:57
of the IBP funding, the programs that had been started, continued.
1:06:01
Uh-huh.
1:06:02
And some new, related kinds of activities that hadn't been able to make it in
1:06:08
under the IBP band, had got funded.
1:06:12
So, for example, a guy by the name of Ed Stone and I went up and stirred
1:06:20
things up at Fairbanks, and got going what eventually became the Taiga
1:06:28
Research Project and Bonanza Creek LTER.
1:06:29
I funded the first work at Coweeta
1:06:36
Hydrological Laboratory.
1:06:38
It was the first funding out of National Science Foundation.
1:06:43
So, yeah, I had an agenda, and it was interdisciplinary
1:06:49
ecosystem research projects.
1:06:52
Interdisciplinary ecosystem in long-term possibility?
1:06:55
Yeah, except the longest term we could go at that point was three years.
1:06:59
Yes.
1:07:02
The other part of my agenda was to see if I could work with a
1:07:05
system that’d create some kind of longer-term funding mechanism.
1:07:14
That was another part of my agenda.
1:07:16
First, to provide the opportunity for continuation.
1:07:20
Secondly, to begin to extend the timelines.
1:07:24
You went from experience with academic institutions, OSU, WSU,
1:07:31
and the Forest Service, to the NS, between the Forest Service and the NSF.
1:07:34
That's a major difference in administrative cultures.
1:07:38
Completely, yeah.
1:07:39
Did you encounter any problems or surprises along those lines?
1:07:43
No.
1:07:44
By the time I went to the NSF I'd become pretty independent.
1:07:49
I largely called my own shots in the Forest Service.
1:07:53
I didn't have a lot of bureaucratic constraints.
1:07:55
And the funding from the NSF just basically accentuated that because
1:08:02
the agency maintained most of their control on researchers through funding.
1:08:09
In effect, we had an independent source of funding.
1:08:12
Neither the university nor the Forest Service controlled that.
1:08:18
So, one of the keys to the history of the Andrews, was that the institutions
1:08:26
couldn't really control it, other than they could have said, “No, we won't
1:08:31
sign off and we won't pass the money to you and we won't let you do research
1:08:34
here.” But, they didn't do that. But at the same time, they had very limited
1:08:40
ability to influence the program because they weren’t providing the funding.
1:08:45
We had $400,000 in money that they really had no say over.
1:08:54
We were not accountable for that in full.
1:08:55
And so,
1:08:58
I had a lot of experience before I went to NSF; two, three, four years of that stuff.
1:09:06
And I fit in very well into the National Science Foundation culture, which is
1:09:12
one of ideas and academic entrepeneurs.
1:09:13
Who did
1:09:19
you work with most closely?
1:09:20
You mentioned someone, Cooper, I think.
1:09:21
Cooper was gone because
1:09:23
-- -- Oh.
1:09:23
-- He had been the program director the two years before.
1:09:28
One of the people I worked with a lot was Tom Callahan, who worked for me.
1:09:34
He was the assistant program officer.
1:09:37
And, the division director that I worked for, the assistant
1:09:46
director, was John Brooks, who I maintained a working, cordial
1:09:51
relationship, for 15 years after that.
1:09:56
And then the assistant director I worked for was a woman
1:09:59
by the name of Betsy Clark.
1:10:01
She
1:10:03
was a molecular biologist, and our working relationship was
1:10:07
a very interesting process.
1:10:11
In effect, she started out by trying to call the shots for the program.
1:10:16
Effectively, I said
1:10:20
this isn't going to work.
1:10:21
I'm going to go home.
1:10:24
She hadn't recruited me.
1:10:26
She had come in just shortly before I did, so she really didn't influence my
1:10:32
selection, and so, I wasn't her boy.
1:10:37
That was the main conflict as far as you could tell?
1:10:39
Well, she wanted to control.
1:10:42
She also was a molecular person rather than an ecosystems person, so
1:10:46
she was pretty low on the learning
1:10:54
curve.
1:10:54
A lot of the first few months there was developing a working
1:10:57
relationship with Betsy.
1:10:58
She seemed to have a lot of confidence
1:11:02
in my abilities, and we worked well for a number of years.
1:11:09
We continued to work well with each other right up to the
1:11:12
beginning of the LTER program.
1:11:14
She left just about the time LTER started.
1:11:20
So,
1:11:24
I didn't have a problem with the culture.
1:11:26
I could have stayed in it another year or two in Washington D.C.
1:11:30
The Forest Service wanted me to.
1:11:32
But I simply didn't see where it was going to be very useful to me to do so.
1:11:40
So, after two years I went back to Corvallis.
1:11:42
You went there in ‘73 and came back in '76?
1:11:44
'75.
1:11:45
'75, okay.
1:11:46
Bob Ruth retired at that point.
1:11:50
It's what they called a trial retirement.
1:11:53
I was given the project leader’s job.
1:11:56
With that,
1:12:06
I actually took over the Cascade Head Experimental Forest as part of that job.
1:12:10
Jack Rothacher, who was the project leader for watershed research at that point in
1:12:17
Corvallis, was in charge of the Andrews.
1:12:19
But, Jack and I have always worked together well, so that wasn't a problem.
1:12:27
Interesting points coming up here.
1:12:34
Your main reason for coming back to Corvallis was that you thought you had
1:12:38
accomplished what you set out to do?
1:12:41
It was a 2-year stint.
1:12:43
Those program officer positions at that time were typically 2-year stints.
1:12:48
But you had another year you could have renewed it if you had wished to stay on.
1:12:52
Not at NSF.
1:12:53
Well, yes.
1:12:54
It would have been a little bit odd.
1:12:57
Okay.
1:12:58
But, it could have been done.
1:13:03
It was not negotiated that way and I never considered staying longer than that.
1:13:11
In two years I felt I'd done all I could.
1:13:18
I pushed the panels just as far as I could.
1:13:23
I probably spent most of “my chips” by that time, and it was time to move on.
1:13:30
Had you worked very closely with the Washington office of the
1:13:34
Forest Service at that time?
1:13:35
No, I don't think I went over to the Washington office more than once or
1:13:38
twice the whole time I was there.
1:13:41
Interesting.
1:13:44
So people from the Washington office didn't come over to talk
1:13:47
to you much either, I gather?
1:13:48
No.
1:13:50
There wasn't any significant dialogue.
1:13:52
The other side of that was the IBP, and then later, the LTER,
1:13:59
created a whole host of new administrative issues on the Andrews.
1:14:03
One of those was the cooperative agreement with the Oregon State
1:14:06
University to administer the Andrews.
1:14:09
Could you elaborate a little bit on that agreement?
1:14:12
Who was involved and what were some of the issues that were involved
1:14:15
in drawing up that memorandum?
1:14:17
We tried to stay away from formal agreements as much as possible.
1:14:23
We figured the less written down the better.
1:14:26
You start writing stuff down, people start looking at it and saying,
1:14:29
"Wait a minute. You can't do that."
1:14:37
I expect there were more documents and things written down than I remember.
1:14:44
But the place where this finally really surfaced seriously was about '77, '78,
1:14:53
when we basically
1:14:58
got money to build the headquarters site [Baseline for site of today – utilities,
1:15:02
trailer pads, roof covers, etc.]
1:15:02
. Hmm.
1:15:03
What was happening then, National Science Foundation money was being administered
1:15:10
by Oregon State to build a facility on the Willamette National Forest.
1:15:17
So, that required that some things be written down in the form of agreements.
1:15:24
It's very interesting that there are some things that probably you wouldn't
1:15:27
get away with today, and that, as far as I know, still aren’t being written
1:15:30
down like, "Who cleans up the mess when this is all over with?" As far
1:15:36
as I know, it's not explicitly stated anywhere as to whose responsibility
1:15:43
it is to clean up that site.
1:15:48
That's what I remembered beginning to get involved much more formally.
1:15:52
There was some standard memoranda and agreements between the PNW Research
1:15:56
Station and Oregon State University.
1:15:59
That was the first one where we really had
1:16:04
explicitly the Willamette National Forest, the research station, and Oregon
1:16:08
State, involved in a three-way deal.
1:16:12
Of course, a fourth institution, the National Science Foundation,
1:16:17
was a step removed from
1:16:23
the whole process.
1:16:23
Uh-huh.
1:16:24
I can remember any number of times prior to that, in the seventies,
1:16:30
people asking "How does this work?” You know, “How the hell does this work?
1:16:34
You got all these university people down there on the Andrews and they're calling
1:16:41
a lot of the shots, and, you're a Forest Service employee and you're spending
1:16:48
National Science Foundation money.
1:16:50
How the hell does this stuff work?" I’d say,
1:17:02
“You know, [Laughs] we just do it.” The institutions probably
1:17:09
just didn't have us far enough up on their radar screen to really think that much
1:17:18
about it.
1:17:18
Once you start making a capital investment like we did with a headquarters site, then
1:17:25
things began to get serious and we put a lot of stuff down on paper as to what's
1:17:31
happening, what the relationship is.
1:17:34
But, some stuff never has gotten down on papers where you've got
1:17:40
Art McKee as a resident manager, as a university employee.
1:17:45
How can a university employee have authority over Forest Service property?
1:17:49
And there's no special use permit.
1:17:52
You know, Wind River [Experimental Forest] , our [Canopy] crane
1:17:54
has a special use permit.
1:17:57
It's a university facility on Forest Service property, but
1:17:59
we have a special use permit.
1:18:00
I don't think Oregon State University has a special use permit.
1:18:04
Maybe they do.
1:18:06
I don't remember us
1:18:10
getting one.
1:18:11
"How do you have a university person in charge of this?
1:18:14
How does Forest Service people spend National Science Foundation money?
1:18:18
That’s not legal." And like I said, there are some things, as far as
1:18:22
I know, still not written down.
1:18:24
Like who cleans up the mess when the party's over?
1:18:31
That's a good point.
1:18:32
Nobody's raised that one before.
1:18:34
Maybe it's not a good one to raise, because these days you
1:18:37
have bean counters out there that are looking down your throat.
1:18:41
“And, did you dot the i's?
1:18:43
Did you cross the t's?’ If
1:18:48
I’m right, and if there really
1:18:53
is no explicit assignment of responsibilities, just sort of
1:18:56
an implicit one, then, they’re liable to say, "Hmmmm...."
1:19:01
Art was telling me he's starting to get signals from the Forest Service,
1:19:05
they are concerned about some of these issues that you were just talking about.
1:19:09
[Laughing] I'm not surprised!!!
1:19:10
He’s having some problems.
1:19:12
But, I had this weird notion that success made all the difference in the world.
1:19:18
If you're successful and productive, they aren’t going to hassle you.
1:19:23
Bullshit.
1:19:25
They’ll hassle you.
1:19:28
So, what success did for the Andrews group was it kept that independent source
1:19:34
of funding coming, which has been very, very powerful in empowering that program.
1:19:44
There had been times when both the Forest Service and the dean of the
1:19:47
Forestry School at Oregon State would loved to have killed that program.
1:19:54
“This stuff is causing us grief! Look all this stuff about old growth!”
1:20:01
Are these problems with the alumni [OSU] and the forest industry?
1:20:05
Sure.
1:20:06
And the dean hired
1:20:09
– -- Stoltenberg?
1:20:09
Stoltenberg.
1:20:13
Carl did not like the research program at the Andrews.
1:20:16
He thought it was a waste.
1:20:17
He thought that, basically, having a property like the Andrews tied
1:20:22
up in a research mode, having all this capital sitting there in
1:20:30
the form of timber dedicated to science, was not responsible.
1:20:36
And the research program had given him fits.
1:20:40
Many of the people that were brought in were not people that he admired.
1:20:48
I think probably Carl could have done something to terminate the program,
1:20:54
he probably would have [laughing], and I think that's one of the reasons he
1:20:57
made no effort to retain me in '86.
1:21:00
He thought, maybe, if I went away, the program would go away.
1:21:07
I was going to ask you about that later, but since you're on that, you moved in
1:21:10
'86 from OSU to Washington, didn't you?
1:21:13
Yeah.
1:21:14
Yeah, and the reason for that was?
1:21:16
Well, there were a whole bunch of reasons for that.
1:21:19
First of all, I'd worked on the Andrews and been the ram-rod of the
1:21:25
ecosystem group from '75 to '85.
1:21:27
It was a multi-million dollar program by that time.
1:21:34
I was burned out.
1:21:38
I was tired of carrying all that responsibility.
1:21:41
Every time the renewal came up, shit, if this thing fails, there
1:21:46
are a lot of people that are going to be going without food.
1:21:51
The cost of crises, cost of challenges of keeping a big program like
1:21:59
that going, money, personality,
1:22:07
just barreling on.
1:22:09
So, I decided to take a sabbatical in the fall of '85,
1:22:13
go to Harvard Forest and write.
1:22:16
I was also in the middle of a personal crisis.
1:22:20
I was trying to decide whether to get a divorce or not, and I wanted
1:22:25
to go someplace to be by myself.
1:22:28
So, I went to Harvard Forest on sabbatical in the fall of '85.
1:22:32
Just by myself; my daughter went with me for several
1:22:39
months.
1:22:39
About midway through that process I got a call from the dean of [College
1:22:44
of Forest Resources] at the University of Washington, saying they had
1:22:45
a position and was I interested?
1:22:49
And I was.
1:22:51
I kind of wanted out of Corvallis.
1:22:54
It was pretty clear I wanted out of my marriage.
1:22:57
Probably wanted out of my marriage by that point.
1:23:00
I wanted to do something different.
1:23:03
I had no real opportunity to teach at Oregon State.
1:23:07
I had graduate students.
1:23:09
I’d just told the University of Washington people the year before, I've
1:23:13
cost you millions of dollars in grants.
1:23:17
Why don't you just hire me?
1:23:20
So, we cut a deal where the Forest Service and the University of Washington would
1:23:27
split me for five years, because I wanted to finish my Forest Service retirement.
1:23:34
Then I'd go full time with the University of Washington.
1:23:38
So, they cut that deal.
1:23:42
But I was prepared to stay behind at Oregon State, if the college was
1:23:48
willing to make a commitment to me.
1:23:51
To move over eventually, to move gradually, over a five-year
1:23:54
period, transition from Forest Service to university.
1:23:59
It would have been a mistake, but I was prepared to do that.
1:24:02
Stoltenberg wasn't prepared to do that.
1:24:06
Well, I was ready to move for a whole bunch of reasons,
1:24:10
personal and professional.
1:24:12
I didn't want to continue to kidder that burden.
1:24:17
The group had matured to the point when they no longer really
1:24:20
wanted a benevolent dictator.
1:24:25
Basically, that's what
1:24:29
I'd been once Dick Waring sort of opted out of the program, which he did about in
1:24:40
'78 to do his own thing.
1:24:41
By
1:24:50
‘79 he had done that.
1:24:52
Hmm.
1:24:52
Once he did that, I pretty much had complete control over the budget.
1:24:56
I approached it
1:25:00
on the basis of what the group as a whole wanted to do, and my judgments as to where
1:25:07
we had the best shots in terms of, given our talent, given the need
1:25:12
to have some level of integration in the program, and so forth.
1:25:17
So, I functioned pretty much as the final authority on what the program
1:25:25
was going to look like, and who was going to get funded out of the big pot
1:25:30
for about ten years.
1:25:33
The group had matured to the point where it really wanted more of a
1:25:38
say in the content of the program and how the money got distributed.
1:25:43
So, we needed to switch to a different way of doing business.
1:25:47
One of the best ways to do that is for a person like myself to leave.
1:25:52
But we had a very good person that was prepared to take over
1:25:55
in the form of Fred Swanson.
1:25:57
Fred had emerged as a very potential successor, so I didn’t have to worry about
1:26:03
the continuing viability of the program.
1:26:07
So it just made sense.
1:26:09
It's a good time to move on.
1:26:12
And, so, I did.
1:26:14
You're in a quite a different
1:26:18
culture at University of Washington that had a long rivalry with OSU.
1:26:21
Had you worked with people at University of Washington prior to that very closely?
1:26:26
I had worked with them a lot in the days of the biome, because we had to have, to
1:26:31
some extent, a program that, even if it wasn't integrated, at least looked like it
1:26:36
communicated across the two institutions.
1:26:41
It was a very different culture.
1:26:44
The University of Washington in the biome days decided to do the standard
1:26:47
academic thing which was fund major professors and graduate students.
1:26:52
We did it at Oregon State for one year and saw this is not going to get us
1:26:56
where we need to go, and we gave that up in favor of hiring some post-docs.
1:27:02
People like Jim Sedell, Fred Swanson, Stan Gregory, who could devote full
1:27:07
energies to the program; I think the correctness of that strategy shows itself.
1:27:14
UW never did that,
1:27:17
and
1:27:20
they have
1:27:33
had a relatively limited history of productive,
1:27:38
interdisciplinary efforts up there.
1:27:40
I went up there.
1:27:44
When I went up there, I told the dean I was not going to try to put together any
1:27:48
more integrated programs, so, if that's what you're hiring me for, forget it.
1:27:54
I'm not going to do that.
1:27:55
But I did.
1:28:00
The interesting thing is that the institution was never prepared to pick up
1:28:08
on those initiatives and do something; in fact, they killed them one way or another.
1:28:17
For example, one of the creations that I was instrumental in was the Olympic
1:28:24
Natural Resource Center, which was going to be a world-class research facility on
1:28:30
the west side of the Olympic peninsula.
1:28:34
We got it chartered by the state, got some funding, and I went
1:28:37
to Congress and got significant funding for research programs there.
1:28:44
Well,
1:28:47
the politics were such that the timber community over at Forks didn't like me.
1:28:56
They didn't like that vision.
1:28:58
They had a vision of a Forks facility.
1:29:02
After we were about two-and-a-half, three years into this, the dean
1:29:10
basically fired me as director of the Olympic Natural Resources Center.
1:29:14
And, today, that facility, which is a beautiful 6-million dollar facility, is
1:29:19
run by the ex-district manager for the [Wash.] Department of Natural Resources.
1:29:27
So, anyway, I went through two or three situations where I created, in
1:29:35
effect, the potential, the core of such integrated effort, and it never happened.
1:29:40
The crane [Wind River Canopy Crane] is another example of that.
1:29:46
So, in effect, the culture of that institution, for one reason or
1:29:51
another, just doesn't provide a very productive ground for a collaborative,
1:29:58
interdisciplinary research activity.
1:30:00
The culture of Oregon State University did.
1:30:05
Perhaps it goes back to the difference between the institutions as expressed
1:30:11
in the early '60s when the Forest Service was first getting established
1:30:15
on campuses in a very serious way.
1:30:20
The attitude at Oregon State was, "This is great.
1:30:24
We want you as collaborators.
1:30:27
We want you as part of our faculty.
1:30:30
Welcome.
1:30:31
You need space to build a lab, we'll give you space to build a
1:30:37
lab.” University of Washington, the attitude was "Give us your money to
1:30:42
do research and we'll take care of it.
1:30:46
And no, we really don’t consider you to be on the same level as we are, so we don't
1:30:53
want you on our faculty, and we don't want you building your laboratories on
1:31:04
our campus." And, perhaps, that's still reflected, echoed today, in the attitudes.
1:31:10
Is that both physical distance and in intellectual distance holding them off?
1:31:15
Yes.
1:31:20
I want to back up and
1:31:30
take a little look at the decision to hire an on-site manager in 1970,
1:31:39
or '71, when Art McKee came in.
1:31:41
What were your concerns at that time?
1:31:44
Well, we really didn't hire an on-site resident manager until about
1:31:52
1978.
1:31:55
We had people who were the coordinators for the research program
1:31:58
down there, but they really had
1:32:03
kind of broad umbrella-like authority over all of the programs down there.
1:32:09
Okay.
1:32:10
The person who had that authority was the forest officer-in-charge, and that was me.
1:32:21
That was Jack Rothacher up to '75-'76, and me
1:32:27
after that.
1:32:27
So, we really didn't hire a resident manager, as such, for the whole program
1:32:35
until sometime in the late '70s.
1:32:38
So Art was hired more as a coordinator.
1:32:40
Art was hired as primarily an on-site coordinator when the IBP
1:32:45
started, early in the IBP days.
1:32:46
Okay.
1:32:50
But his authority was pretty limited.
1:32:51
And
1:32:54
that changes about 1978?
1:32:55
Yeah, when I hired him as the resident manager, I gave him a lot more authority.
1:33:03
I
1:33:06
made it very clear that everybody was supposed to respond to his
1:33:12
directions, including the Forest Service people down there.
1:33:17
I won't say that was totally honored, but to a fair degree it was.
1:33:23
So, my recollection was that it was something that happened in
1:33:29
the late '70s, as we began to develop a longer-term program.
1:33:35
One other thing I wanted to ask you here.
1:33:39
You left to go to NSF in '73, came back in '75, and I was curious
1:33:44
if you recognized any significant changes in the group in your absence?
1:33:48
Had things changed in the way you operated, or the kinds
1:33:53
issues they were taking on?
1:33:56
Not really, but it did mature.
1:34:02
The complement of people had changed slightly, but fundamentally it was still
1:34:07
pretty much the same program when I came back in '75 as when I went in in '72.
1:34:12
How about in terms of interaction with the district and with the region?
1:34:18
No, it hadn't changed at that point.
1:34:21
In fact, when I came back and took over the Andrews, I can remember we
1:34:26
had a ranger there, an old friend by the name of Bob Burns, who really sort
1:34:32
of thought you ran a district kind of like you were on a military post.
1:34:36
And the tensions between him and some of the more flaky academics,
1:34:46
more laid-back academics, I should say, was tough.
1:34:51
Uh-huh.
1:34:54
I’m trying to remember when he left.
1:34:56
We can get dates on all this stuff, but the subsequent ranger
1:35:01
was much easier to work with.
1:35:03
When Bob left, we
1:35:08
really pushed on the Willamette National Forest to recruit somebody
1:35:13
who was more sympathetic to research and had more tolerance.
1:35:17
And they did.
1:35:18
A fellow by the name of Jim Caswell.
1:35:22
Jim was good.
1:35:23
He was a real improvement to work with from the science standpoint.
1:35:28
He had a lot more tolerance for the flakiness of academics.
1:35:36
The forest supervisor’s office sounds like they were receptive to your ideas.
1:35:39
I think Mike Kerrick was the supervisor at that time.
1:35:43
I'm not sure.
1:35:44
But in any case, clearly, the supervisor's office was more sympathetic.
1:35:49
We were working a lot with the regional office by then and the regional office
1:35:54
clearly made their interests known, "Hey, you really need somebody who works
1:35:59
better with those researchers, supporting the program.” Then the next ranger
1:36:06
took over; a, guy by the name of Steve.
1:36:09
Eubanks?
1:36:10
Eubanks.
1:36:11
And Steve loved it.
1:36:14
When Jim left, we made presentations that we really have to make
1:36:20
research compatibility a real high point in this search.
1:36:24
And they did.
1:36:26
We used to
1:36:28
call him the “research ranger.”
1:36:32
He was really into it.
1:36:33
He loved it.
1:36:35
He was current.
1:36:37
He was thinking up ways all the time in how to implement this stuff, and he was a
1:36:47
major participant in the research program.
1:36:51
It wasn’t a matter of staying inside and watching it.
1:36:54
Steve was in there mixing it up all the time.
1:36:57
Proposing things.
1:36:59
Jim had done some of that, but Steve was just totally into it.
1:37:03
What's your perception on why there’s a change in attitude here at the
1:37:08
forest supervisor and regional level?
1:37:10
What's your perception to why that change took place?
1:37:14
I think it changed because the group [Andrews/IBP-LTER] had
1:37:18
become increasingly influential.
1:37:21
And some people saw it very clearly as a place where good science was
1:37:28
being introduced, it was relevant.
1:37:30
Others may not have agreed with the findings, but knew
1:37:33
it was a serious player.
1:37:37
What would you identify as some of the more significant accomplishments
1:37:40
of the group at that point in time?
1:37:43
Well, I think one obvious one was woody debris in streams.
1:37:48
Okay.
1:37:48
That was an early one where it ran very counter to regional policy at that point,
1:37:58
but was apparently persuasive enough that
1:38:07
the region turned its policies around in a very short period of time.
1:38:11
In a matter of two or three years.
1:39:03
Some areas they were more receptive than others.
1:39:07
When Steve [Eubanks] got involved, we really began to see change, since he
1:39:12
was connected right into the community of rangers and resource managers.
1:39:23
Changes happened fairly quickly.
1:39:25
We had a lot more access.
1:39:26
It
1:39:29
was about in the late '70s when we began to bring groups of people in.
1:39:35
Management teams from different national forests had come through.
1:39:39
The region did or the forest?
1:39:42
Well, individual national forests came through, and the
1:39:44
regional officers came through.
1:39:44
Okay.
1:39:50
It was also about that time the national forest administration
1:39:55
became aware of the fact that they couldn't ignore science anymore.
1:40:01
If they did, they were going to have to deal with it in court.
1:40:05
So they might not have been sympathetic, but they were becoming
1:40:08
more aware of the need to be informed.
1:40:11
So you're saying more aggressive action by some of the environmental groups like
1:40:15
Sierra Club, for example, had an impact.
1:40:17
Well, it did have an impact, and not with reference to the Andrews specifically.
1:40:27
When National Forest Service administration began to go to court and
1:40:31
began to have its own science experts called as witnesses against them,
1:40:39
the first reaction was anger and a desire to get these people onboard.
1:40:45
And Max Peterson was a commentator, that's why he was chief [U.S.
1:40:51
Forest Service] at that time.
1:40:54
But very quickly I think most people in the National Forest [System] realized,
1:40:58
well, no, we can't control these people.
1:41:03
So they better know what they're doing and we better try to influence
1:41:07
what they're doing, because there are going to be forces to contend with.
1:41:16
So, I think the legal actions of the conservation groups during the
1:41:21
60's and 70's dramatically altered the relationship of research and
1:41:27
management within the Forest Service.
1:41:30
That created anger at times, and antagonism, but dramatically increased the
1:41:38
power of the science side of the program.
1:41:41
So you were able to tie into that when you were making arguments
1:41:45
with the region for better or more sympathetic managers on local sites.
1:41:51
Did you consciously do that?
1:41:53
No, I didn't use that argument.
1:41:56
I used just pretty much a straight argument, “We’ve got a cooperative program
1:42:00
going here. And it doesn't work very well if we’re constantly butting heads over
1:42:09
issues which are really irrelevant.
1:42:12
Lifestyle issues.”
1:42:13
Yeah.
1:42:15
I don't want to use up all your time here.
1:42:17
Maybe a few more minutes.
1:42:18
That issue about lifestyles came up in some previous interviews where
1:42:24
in relation to the District of Blue River and the residents of Blue
1:42:27
River, the scientists coming in here.
1:42:29
I think Al Levno was pointing this out, as they tended to be somewhat younger,
1:42:33
and a little bit more in tune with the counter-culture that was prevelant in
1:42:37
the '70s, and then just a different kind of people than were in Blue River.
1:42:42
Did you notice any tensions or problems developing in terms of
1:42:46
relations with the community itself?
1:42:46
I didn't notice tensions with
1:42:50
the local community particularly.
1:42:53
The tensions were with the men, with the district personnel.
1:42:57
Okay.
1:42:58
And,
1:43:05
of course, there may have been tensions between the logger types, the red
1:43:12
necks, and some of the academics.
1:43:17
I couldn't say one way or the another.
1:43:20
But, I was very aware of the fact that some of the district people, including
1:43:26
the district ranger that I mentioned, just were very uncomfortable with
1:43:31
skinny-dipping, long hair, odd hours.
1:43:38
You’d
1:43:40
see university vehicles parked at the swimming hole at 3:00 in the afternoon,
1:43:45
and that really upset the ranger, some of the Forest Service guys.
1:43:51
Well, some of those people were going out at 2:00 in the morning.
1:43:56
So,
1:43:58
the tensions that I saw were really tensions primarily between
1:44:02
the district and the academics.
1:44:03
That's interesting.
1:44:04
Okay.
1:44:10
One other thing probably is.
1:44:11
I have some other things but I don't want to cut into too much of your weekend here.
1:44:16
You came up here too, so I don't want you to have you making trips
1:44:20
that you don't get a good return on.
1:44:22
Its been pretty productive so far.
1:44:24
I want to get into this a little bit though.
1:44:25
Fred Swanson pointed out that a turning point for the group there was the
1:44:31
Mount St. Helens explosion and the
1:44:35
opportunity it provided to get the group off of the Andrews and
1:44:38
into another venue for research.
1:44:42
Could you maybe discuss a little bit how the group became involved
1:44:44
in that initiative and what kinds of results came out of that?
1:44:49
First of all, we began to do that on our own
1:44:57
before St. Helens erupted.
1:45:00
One of the things I became aware of when I came back in '75, was I was
1:45:04
the only one that knew everybody.
1:45:07
The group was becoming bigger, 35, 40, 45 people involved, a lot of them
1:45:14
didn't know each other, and didn’t know what each other were doing.
1:45:17
So we initiated a couple of things.
1:45:20
And one of them was “pulses.” The notion was to take the group
1:45:26
away from their ordinary venue.
1:45:28
Take them to some other place and get out and live with each other for
1:45:34
a couple of weeks of intensive work.
1:45:37
And we had done the first of those in 1978.
1:45:43
We all went to the South Fork of the Hoh River in Olympic National Park for two
1:45:49
weeks, and worked, and got wet, which we did a lot, just working together
1:46:00
and learning a lot about each other.
1:46:02
And I saw this as, as not just information gathering exercises,
1:46:08
but team-building exercises.
1:46:11
Go out and suffer together.
1:46:13
And also, hypothesis checking.
1:46:16
You know, you got these ideas on the Andrews.
1:46:19
Do they work in this new system?
1:46:22
So we had begun to take ourselves out of an Andrews context and put
1:46:28
ourselves in little mini crucibles.
1:46:30
Both for team-building and for science.
1:46:34
When St. Helens came along, it was an extraordinary opportunity.
1:46:42
You just wanted to be a part of it.
1:46:46
Fred and Jim Sedell and I were well positioned within the Experiment
1:46:51
Station [PNW] to take leading roles.
1:46:57
Particularly, as it became clear that the long-term issues were
1:47:03
going to be ecological issues and not [timber] salvage issues.
1:47:07
Some of the early involvement by the station had to do with condition
1:47:12
of timber, salvage potential, decay, and that sort of stuff.
1:47:18
There were extraordinary opportunities we just wanted to be a part of, positioned
1:47:23
in the institution that was going to have a lot of control over the situation,
1:47:27
and at the same time, also connected to the National Science Foundation.
1:47:34
So, effectively what the three of us became were the coordinators,
1:47:38
the gatekeepers in the these examples; in my case, terrestrial
1:47:43
ecology, Fred's case, geomorphology, Jim’s case, aquatic research.
1:47:48
We became the research coordinators for Mount St. Helens.
1:47:52
And as such, we acquired control over a significant amount of funds,
1:47:59
both Forest Service funds and National Science Foundation funds.
1:48:04
And, we didn't know what we, maybe Fred knew what we were going to do.
1:48:07
I sure as hell didn't know what was going to come out of this,
1:48:11
but it was just too exciting.
1:48:13
And so, a lot of us moved our activity up there for about two years.
1:48:20
It began to tail off in the third year.
1:48:24
We were off the Andrews, but we were still working together.
1:48:28
We had two immense pulses where we brought in groups of people for two week periods.
1:48:36
Had 150 people in one of the pulses.
1:48:42
Maybe Fred knew where this was going to go.
1:48:44
I didn't know where it was going to go.
1:48:46
I knew it was useful to be up there in an interdisciplinary context,
1:48:52
but obviously, what we learned from it had to do with disturbances
1:48:58
and how disturbances work.
1:49:01
Out of that came the whole concept of; first we called it survivors, then I
1:49:06
began to call it biological legacies.
1:49:11
It sort of illuminated the whole issue of disturbances and biological
1:49:16
legacies and how nature restores systems after a disturbance.
1:49:21
The neat thing about St. Helens was that it had so many different kinds of things.
1:49:26
There wasn't just one kind of a disturbance.
1:49:29
There were a dozen different major kinds of disturbances or combinations
1:49:35
of disturbances that occurred out there.
1:49:38
So, that it wasn't like looking just at wildfires, something like that.
1:49:48
I don't see that as the first time we went off the Andrews, and it wasn’t
1:49:52
the last time we went off the Andrews.
1:49:55
For one reason or another, we went to Sequoia National Park
1:50:02
two times, I think in '83 and '84 as a pulse.
1:50:08
And for some reason Fred chose not to go.
1:50:14
I don't know whether he thought it was too distracting or what, but again, we really
1:50:19
had really outstanding interdisciplinary efforts at Sequoia, stretching our minds
1:50:28
and our experience and our hypotheses.
1:50:32
So, we did it before St. Helens and we did it after St. Helens.
1:50:36
What were the origins of the idea of a "pulse"?
1:50:39
That was mine.
1:50:41
And it started with a need for a team-building exercise.
1:50:48
I got people don't know each other!!!
1:50:51
That is to say, any given individual might know 40, 50, 60 percent of the group.
1:50:59
Like I say, nobody but me knew everybody.
1:51:02
And so,
1:51:06
it was considered as a team-building exercise.
1:51:11
And it's fun, it's productive, it's refreshing, it’s
1:51:17
energizing, and it always worked.
1:51:24
Regardless of how miserable the conditions are, the group comes away with a lot of
1:51:29
respect, and a lot better understanding and appreciation of each other.
1:51:35
So, it started with that.
1:51:37
And at the Hoh it became very clear to me that, "Wow! This is really a
1:51:43
neat way to check out whether or not your Andrews vision extrapolates.”
1:51:51
And, it usually doesn't, but that's great because it feeds back and broadens you.
1:51:58
So, and it also became very clear to me, "Boy, this is a way to generate a
1:52:03
lot of new numbers really fast." You go out there and you work your butt off.
1:52:09
And you work as a team; about 35, or 40, 45 people for
1:52:16
twelve, thirteen days straight.
1:52:18
You get a lot done.
1:52:21
Did you have some model?
1:52:22
What was the inspiration for that?
1:52:23
Well, fundamentally, all it is is an expedition.
1:52:28
We used to do research all the time in ecological expeditions.
1:52:31
I never had any experience with that, but
1:52:36
that's how they used to do a lot of science research.
1:52:38
You get everybody together and take them out someplace, and you’d
1:52:43
be there for maybe six months.
1:52:43
It's just an expeditionary kind of an attitude, and I
1:52:49
love to go different places.
1:52:52
So, "Hey, sounds like a groovy idea!”
1:52:56
Had you read about any of those in the past?
1:52:58
I mean, what kind of set you off?
1:53:00
I don't know of anybody who has done it quite that way.
1:53:05
Except my group.
1:53:06
Yeah.
1:53:08
You do have people that take extended field trips, stuff
1:53:11
like that, a lot of courses.
1:53:16
I ran across letters, copies of the letters when you're trying
1:53:18
to organize the first pulse.
1:53:21
It looks like you were having some problems with scheduling, getting
1:53:24
people together in the same place.
1:53:25
Oh yeah.
1:53:27
Was that the most serious problem you ran into?
1:53:28
No, it wasn't.
1:53:31
I had a lot of power.
1:53:32
I was a Forest Service project leader.
1:53:37
Had a budget there.
1:53:40
I was principal investigator on the major Andrews grant.
1:53:45
Had a lot of power there.
1:53:47
And so, I had a lot of power to persuade people.
1:53:53
A lot of people wanted to do it, and I could give them the permission to do it.
1:54:02
The biggest problem I generally had was, like at the Olympic [National Park, Hoh
1:54:09
River location] , was getting permission to do it, because our party size exceeded
1:54:14
what was acceptable for the backcountry.
1:54:16
You still have people on the Olympic National Park staff who hate my guts
1:54:22
because I persuaded the superintendent to give us permission to do this.
1:54:28
It was against the rules.
1:54:32
Had permission to do it, but it was against the rules, and against
1:54:36
their particular set of values.
1:54:39
So, the biggest problem was generally was the host
1:54:47
property
1:54:50
and not getting the people to go.
1:54:57
In fact, the only time I really failed was the time when Fred
1:55:03
wouldn't go to the Sequoia.
1:55:05
He just wouldn't do it.
1:55:11
Most of the time, I didn't have to bring a lot of pressure to bear.
1:55:15
It was always a challenge, of course, to schedule the thing, so that you
1:55:20
could get maximum participation.
1:55:23
We usually did it in the fall, which was sort of the end of the field season.
1:55:29
Be ready to quit what you've been doing.
1:55:32
And you're burned out, in fact, on what you've been doing.
