00:01
How much do
00:12
you know about the project
00:22
so far?
00:22
I don’t where things stand.
00:30
I knew that you had been contracted to do it [history and oral histories]
00:34
, that you had been talking around, and then I saw some things recently about
00:38
trying to convene some small group to come up with some thematic dialogue.
00:43
Which I think is a really good idea.
00:44
That will be quite interesting, and I’d enjoy participating in that.
00:50
Yeah, Tim’s trying to schedule that for me.
00:52
I think that is a great idea.
00:53
I think stuff will come in the round robin that you might not otherwise extract.
00:57
I
01:00
read the early prospectus for it, and so I have some sense of some
01:08
of the cross-cutting themes being developed, in chronological fashion.
01:12
It looks really interesting and like you are really trying
01:14
to set the thing up in an
01:19
intellectually challenging and sophisticated way that
01:24
is faithful to the history.
01:26
You know, I was impressed by the structure, but that is about it.
01:31
I haven’t talked to anyone who’s been interviewed so I don’t know how you
01:33
-- What I am really trying to get is a good, clear understanding of your
01:40
background and the people who seemed to work together at the Andrews.
01:43
By background, I mean,
01:51
your
01:57
personal experience and training, your personal origins, and what
01:59
attracted you to the Northwest.
02:01
Well,
02:06
I was born in New York to a New York family, a strongly east coast
02:17
family.
02:19
My exposure to Oregon really
02:24
began at the age of 13, when my father took a position at University
02:26
of Oregon’s Biology Department.
02:26
At that time, I remember thinking that Oregon
02:37
was even more exotic than California, as far as I could tell.
02:41
I didn’t know anything about it, came out here, in ’66, and it took
02:54
me about three years here before I began to realize that
03:00
I was falling in love with it.
03:02
Up until that time, I was just amazed at the difference between Oregon and
03:09
elsewhere, and just what people did.
03:11
I remember the first year in Oregon, we went to see the McKenzie River White Water
03:18
Parade, an event held in the McKenzie the weekend before fishing season opened.
03:26
And I remember sitting on the shore at Martin rapids, watching these
03:31
drunks go through the rapids drunk, and the sheriff going up-and-down
03:36
there fishing people out of the drink.
03:38
I was just amazed events like this happened, and I remember thinking
03:43
how much I wanted to be on the river.
03:47
It was so different from my background, which had a lot of water risks, because
03:53
I grew up, spent my summers, in Cape Cod.
03:55
I had a very
03:59
ocean-oriented life as a boy, but hadn’t really been in a place in which there was
04:08
so much water, rivers as well as ocean.
04:14
So my background really was that I was born in the east, moved to the west
04:21
at the end of my “Wonder Bread” years,
04:25
but was very much of an east coast family. It’s interesting that all my
04:31
three other brothers and sisters and parents are all back on the east coast.
04:34
I am the only one that bonded with the landscape.
04:38
But that really didn’t happen for me until I went off to college, in ‘69.
04:46
U of O?
04:47
Actually, I went to Reed [College, Portland, Ore.] , for
04:49
at least a couple of years.
04:51
I fell in with a motley crew of adventurous souls who were
04:59
interested in exploring, in all senses of the word, what there was to
05:07
find in the local geography.
05:09
And so, for me, the real connection came because my roommate, who was from
05:14
Tennessee, brought a boat that he had
05:17
built for navigating Tennessee waterways back out with him to Reed.
05:25
It was one of these flat-bottomed, things that you go down to black
05:29
water swamp in Tennessee with -- the cottonmouths hanging from the trees and
05:35
the alligators -- and he was prepared to try it on the whitewater rivers of Oregon.
05:38
Which, as it turns out, was a major mistake.
05:42
But I was all too eager to join him in this folly.
05:45
So, I went out and bought myself a raft at a time when, this is about
05:50
1970-71, people didn’t do it a lot.
05:54
And I fell in love with, I mean, we tried desperately to kill
05:59
ourselves in several different ways.
06:02
Stories that I won’t tell, but I fell in love with the rivers in particular
06:07
and the landscape in general, and so that really became the formative, I
06:13
mean in terms, of giving me a focal point, a geographical focal point.
06:20
I realized the Northwest was where I wanted to be.
06:23
And that persisted, for me through years of, well,
06:33
dropping out school, working on a fishing boat, and planting trees and landscaping.
06:39
Doing stuff like that, and
06:44
eventually going back and finishing a degree at the University of Oregon.
06:47
That is where I got my undergraduate [degree] ; the University of Oregon.
06:50
So, you were doing landscaping work in between there?
06:52
Yeah, landscaping, and in general, you know, getting my
06:57
hands dirty and pretty wet.
07:00
What was your major at Reed?
07:02
At Reed it was biochemistry, and I was all set to be a
07:08
biochemist just like my father.
07:12
But somewhere along the line, I didn’t like living around the
07:20
smell of benzene all the time, was what it really came out to.
07:25
It was discovering all of this wonderfulness in the great outdoors,
07:31
and the contrast between that and working in the laboratory.
07:37
Even that stuff is pretty interesting to me, intellectually, the aesthetics
07:43
of it just didn’t fit with what I felt myself moving towards.
07:48
So I dropped out of that, but retained a pretty strong interest
07:51
in science and scientific pursuits.
07:56
But then I took this long, end run, of really getting
08:00
into rivers in a very big way.
08:02
Became a white-water rafting guide and worked for 12-plus
08:07
years as a professional.
08:10
Where was that?
08:11
Mostly in Oregon, but also in California and Idaho.
08:17
For a while, I worked for other companies, and then, I actually owned a river
08:20
company in Eugene for about five years.
08:25
And led trips to haul them in.
08:29
That really was my identity.
08:31
I saw myself as a river guide first, and a
08:35
banjo player, and somewhere along the line, a student.
08:40
When I was an undergraduate at the U of O, I
08:56
was in a program, in fact the only way I could talk myself into going back
09:07
to college, was a special program in the Honors College, that essentially, let you
09:11
do whatever you wanted to do, and call it a college degree, as long as you could get
09:16
three faculty members to go along with it.
09:19
Not too different from graduate school in that sense.
09:24
I was fortunate to be in a program where people thought my idea of
09:32
going out and studying the Willamette River was good, so basically, I used
09:35
the Willamette River as the focal point of my undergraduate education.
09:41
Then, I took lots of things around it on the geology, the history,
09:44
the ecology, and political science of the river, and I really didn’t
09:49
know what I was most interested in.
09:50
I mean, I was interested in the river and it seemed a pretty interesting
09:58
entity to try to build on from the sciences and political sciences,
10:05
hang everything together around a common theme with understanding the
10:10
history of the river and the way the river was used in the past and
10:13
how that translates to the future.
10:18
Who were some of the people you were working with on that?
10:20
The guy who was the most
10:24
influential faculty member, really guided me through most of that, was
10:28
Stan Cook, who was in the Biology Department, but he was also an ecologist
10:34
and very committed to getting an environmental studies program started.
10:37
This was when environmental studies were just beginning to be talked
10:41
about as a kind of integrated whole.
10:43
We tried to get our environmental studies program going at U of O and
10:48
get a grant to underwrite it, and that is actually where I met Fred
10:58
Swanson.
10:59
Fred was just finishing up his Ph.D., and I think Stan was a
11:03
member of his committee, or at least had been an associate.
11:08
And so, I remember sitting in Stan Cook’s office, just having
11:14
some random discussion about
11:18
the state of the universe and things like environmentalists.
11:21
And Fred Swanson poked his head in the door, and Stan introduced us.
11:25
And that turned out to be an important meeting, although at
11:29
the time it didn’t register.
11:30
Register?
11:30
Didn’t entirely register.
11:31
Well Stan said, “You guys ought to, you know, get together at some point.” And
11:40
I did end up taking Fred’s class which he was teaching at the University of
11:45
Oregon, a class in forest geomorphology.
11:47
Which in a class,
11:51
I think Fred was the first person I heard use the word geomorphology
11:55
in a sentence, far as I can tell.
11:58
And that was my first time of hearing about the H.J. Andrews, because Fred at
12:05
that point was beginning to do work up at the Andrews, and was using examples
12:11
from the Andrews to flesh out a class,
12:18
and to study the effect of human management on forests, natural
12:22
processes with in forests, stream channels, and so forth.
12:26
At that point, I was completely focused on rivers, not this business about
12:31
talking about dirt and organic matter, or
12:36
trees.
12:36
Let’s cut to the chase and talk about rivers.
12:38
So,
12:42
I enjoyed the class and I enjoyed Fred.
12:45
Fred at the time, struck me as very interesting and a really
12:51
committed guy to the subject matter, committed to educating people
13:01
on the subject matter.
13:01
But, it wasn’t really what I was doing, so it was kind of a footnote
13:04
at that time to my other classes.
13:09
Did you take trips up to the Andrews then?
13:10
I don’t recall.
13:11
I don’t think so, as I think there was a class field trip to the Andrews I missed
13:19
for some reason, is what I remember.
13:21
So, no bells went off there and I didn’t actually see the place.
13:25
But I can remember my first trip up there, and that was,
13:30
if I can jump ahead in the history.
13:33
I graduated from U of O in ‘77.
13:37
Again, with a very sort of eclectic degree.
13:40
What happened, was I got a grant from the Oregon Committee for the Humanities
13:44
to fund a traveling “dog-and-pony” show.
13:50
We called it the Willamette River Chautauqua.
13:53
It was
13:56
a slide show, one of these six projector slide shows together
14:01
with oral histories, followed by a discussion about the role
14:05
of the river in the lives of the people sitting in the room.
14:09
You say we.
14:09
Who was involved with that?
14:10
There was another guy I worked with
14:14
who was a photographer.
14:16
He took the pictures, and I did the taped interviews, and it was really fun.
14:22
Again, I hadn’t finished my degree, and this was work towards a thesis
14:27
I was pulling together as a senior.
14:30
I traveled up and down the Willamette River, interviewing old-timers, people
14:35
who had been steamboat pilots or had run log drives in the river, or
14:39
Indians who had fished at the falls.
14:41
This was my real excursion to history at that point.
14:46
I really enjoyed and had a good time with it.
14:50
Finding these people and doing exactly what you’re doing; sitting
14:53
with a tape recorder and asking them questions about the river.
14:55
I wrote it up
14:59
as a thesis, then we put it together as a slide show, and took it up and down.
15:04
Put a show on in Corvallis, Independence, Portland, and Eugene, and we would
15:09
usually attract people to come and talk about the river in some form or another.
15:14
We got Barry Lopez to come and read Indian stories about the river, had
15:18
some guys from the political science department talk about it, and a
15:23
guy from landscape architecture.
15:24
We had a lot of fun with it, but it was interesting for me because
15:29
it gave me a chance to really try on the humanities in a sense.
15:38
I really enjoyed it, but I realized it was not going to be my life’s work.
15:44
I mean, there were other things pulling on me.
15:48
A lot of that really came down to time spent,
15:53
as part of my career at U of O, I found myself teaching classes about rivers.
16:03
It was an experimental college kind of thing, and I did a one semester
16:07
thing on rivers, culminating in a raft trip down the Rogue River.
16:12
And
16:15
it was clear that “the river” was going to be my focal point,
16:20
and at some point I began to think about, well, maybe there is a science of rivers.
16:28
I need to know what to call it.
16:29
I had heard about geomorphology, but I thought that was associated with
16:33
forests because that is the way we had studied and talked about it.
16:36
But I began to read about it and realized that there were people who
16:41
made careers studying rivers, and that was really the motivation for me to
16:46
go on to graduate school, which I did,
16:50
in ‘79.
16:52
And I decided at that point that I wanted to go somewhere other than
16:56
the Northwest for graduate school.
16:59
I loved the Northwest and I expected to come back to it, and was running
17:03
rivers full-time in the summertime, so it was always going to pull me back.
17:07
But I really wanted to go
17:11
the East coast.
17:12
I think I wanted to test that, see what my affinities for that as well were.
17:17
Had your family gone back there?
17:19
They were still in Eugene.
17:21
Maybe there may have been something there, who knows?
17:26
But I was interested in trying on a different way of looking
17:31
at it, and the concept of going east to get educated, appealed to
17:38
me.
17:38
I ended up going back in ‘79; to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,
17:45
which scared me no end.
17:47
The idea of trading in the foot-loose and
17:52
fancy-free, or academic-free lifestyle, for what I took to be a fairly-focused
17:59
educational environment at Hopkins.
18:05
Why Hopkins?
18:08
That’s interesting.
18:08
I had heard through the grapevine,
18:14
because
18:16
most of my decisions at that time were being made in a somewhat
18:20
muddled way, as they are now.
18:23
But, I had heard through the grapevine that people who were doing rivers, a
18:31
lot of people who were doing rivers for the U.S. Geological Survey,
18:35
had been trained at John Hopkins.
18:36
That’s all I
18:39
knew.
18:39
I literally went to the college library, and I got some catalogues out.
18:46
I was thumbing around and my search image was something that looked like,
18:53
well, environmental studies with a river focus.
18:57
And I wasn’t sure whether it was going to be rivers, or ecology,
19:03
or rivers, or politics of rivers.
19:06
It was all kind of muddled together.
19:08
So, the places I had looked at, were places like the Yale School of Forestry
19:13
that looked like you could sort of go there and do anything you wanted.
19:17
Cornell, because it had a department of natural resources, which
19:21
sounded like rivers, although it turned out to be mostly lakes.
19:25
Hopkins was kind of a dark horse, because I had heard
19:28
about it through the grapevine.
19:30
Well, I got there, and again in this muddled way that I did things at the
19:35
time, I said, “Well, I am going to go look and see what these places look
19:38
like.” So, in the dead of winter, I went back there, and without telling anybody
19:45
I was coming, I just sort of showed up.
19:47
I walked into the basement of Johns Hopkins, the department office,
19:52
and was looking at the blackboard all academic buildings have, which
19:57
have everybody’s name and door on it, and I saw, M. Gordon Wolman,
20:07
Chair.
20:07
Where have I seen that name before, M. Gordon?
20:11
Then, I realized years prior, I had been sitting in the main office of the
20:17
river company I had been working for, and picked a book out of the shelf.
20:24
It was called, “Fluvial Processes and Geomorphology,” a book about
20:30
rivers, the science of rivers, and I realized this was the guy, that the
20:35
second author was M. Gordon Wolman. It all sort of came to me. I said,
20:42
“Oh, I bet he knows something about
20:46
rivers!” [Chuckle].
20:47
Turns out to be one of the great gurus of the field.
20:49
But I had, it was pure serendipity.
20:52
It was utterly unplanned on my part.
20:54
I just discovered all of this, while I am staring at this blackboard.
20:57
On top of that, he wasn’t even there.
21:00
So, I didn’t even get a chance to visit with him while I was there.
21:03
But everyone I talked to, I said “Here I am, and I am Gordon Grant,
21:07
and am interested in rivers.” Everyone said “Well, you’ve got to talk to
21:18
Reds [Wolman]
21:42
.” So, that is how I ended up at Hopkins.
21:47
I actually met Reds on the phone when he called to say, “Well,
21:51
we will let you in but we don’t know what you are going to do.
22:01
Seems like you are clearly interested in rivers and have done a lot.” But we
22:07
“Just want to let you know that when you come out of here, we expect you
22:11
to know something about something.” And so, at the time, I wasn’t quite
22:19
sure what that “something” was, but I knew it had to do with rivers and this
22:23
guy seemed, well, I really enjoyed talking with the guy on the phone.
22:29
He is just very interesting, and this charming and insightful guy, and you
22:32
could just tell this from 3000 miles away.
22:35
Had you read his books before that?
22:37
Well, I had read the first chapter.
22:38
And the book, it turns out to be one the key books; it’s like a bible.
22:44
It turns out this is literally the classic in the field, and still is.
22:51
It is a classic, not only because in one book it sort of encoded
22:55
everything that people knew up to that time, and had learned and
23:00
studied about the science of rivers.
23:02
But it is a marvelously lucidly-written book.
23:08
You read this thing, and it is the model of how a textbook ought to be written.
23:13
And I remember actually sitting and reading it as a textbook.
23:16
You know, it read well, and it is a very rare kind of thing.
23:21
So, it’s pure happenstance the way things worked out, but at the time
23:28
I didn’t know any of this stuff.
23:31
Even today, when you’re entering a new field in fluvial geomorphology, it is not
23:37
uncommon for people to go here just to find out what people, what these guys, the
23:42
three authors on the book; Luna Leopold, Reds Wolman, and John Miller, are doing.
23:49
All three of them have just been very, very significant people in the field.
23:53
Your work, though, was on rivers of western Oregon, wasn’t it?
23:57
Well what happened was, and this gets me back again, if I am going
24:02
on too long, just let me know.
24:06
What you’re probably asking, how I got back here, and that
24:11
too has bit of a story to it.
24:12
Or if they had any problem with you doing the research that far out.
24:15
Absolutely not.
24:16
I mean Hopkins was completely
24:21
delighted, as far as I could tell.
24:28
You sort of swam in, swam around the place, or floundered as the
24:32
case may be, until you figured out something you wanted to do.
24:37
Reds would sort of help you a bit, but he kind of left it up to
24:41
you to figure out what it was you were really interested in doing.
24:45
For me, it’s what worked, what got me back to Oregon, which I always
24:52
kind of thought I was going to do, but hadn’t really figured out how
24:59
or why.
25:00
I was running the McKenzie River with a commercial outfit, and I ran into
25:03
a group of people that I knew at the take out who invited me to a pot luck.
25:10
At the pot luck I happened to meet another friend of theirs, Gordie Reeves.
25:17
And as things go at potlucks, we got to talking and I asked, “Well, what
25:20
do you do?” “I study fish.” “‘Oh, that is interesting, where do you do that?”
25:23
“Well, I am at Oregon State.” “That
25:28
is interesting.’ We start talking about our various interests and he
25:32
said, “I’ll send you some papers.” Well, I would like to find out what
25:36
people in Oregon are doing about rivers and fish and all this stuff.
25:39
He sent me a bunch of papers.
25:43
And I noticed when I looked at the papers, that at least two-thirds of them were
25:48
written by Fred Swanson; Swanson and Lienkaemper, Lienkaemper and Swanson.
25:53
These were all early papers of describing the forest environment out there.
25:59
I was fascinated.
26:00
“Gee, I remember this guy, he taught me,” and this was now seven years later.
26:09
That would have just been it except for the fact that Gordie Reeves wrote me
26:13
a note, somewhat angry, saying, “Could you please send me my papers back.
26:19
At the time, he is a struggling graduate student, I am a struggling graduate
26:23
student, and the Xerox machines were sold a dime a copy, and none of us had a dime.
26:29
So, the idea was, I will send you the papers, you make your
26:32
copies, and send it back.
26:33
Well, I had obviously not fulfilled my end of the bargain.
26:37
So, not having a dime, I sent Gordie his papers back, but I said, maybe
26:43
if I write this guy Swanson, he will send me a free copy of this thing.
26:47
So, I wrote Fred a note and said, “Look, you probably don’t remember
26:51
me. I was the guy back in Oregon, took geomorphology from you seven years ago
26:57
and asked far too many questions, and
27:02
could you please send me the papers?’ He wrote me back a very nice note,
27:05
“Oh yeah, I remember you, sort of a trouble-maker in the third row.
27:07
Here are
27:11
your papers, and by the way, what’s the Wolman group doing?” Fred,
27:15
being in this field, knew very well this guy I was working with.
27:20
Well, “Wolman group” was kind of a joke, because, there was no group, I mean,
27:24
we were all kind of studying with this guy. This was a marvelous guy, but,
27:28
it was not like you had an audience with the pope. You would go in there
27:32
and have your twenty, twenty-minute audience, and he would impart wisdom and
27:37
intellectual nourishment, and you’d leave.
27:39
That was the Wolman group.
27:40
Did he have a lot of students?
27:41
He had a lot, a surprising number of students,
27:46
and there was a certain self-selection process, because you had to be able to
27:50
handle being with a guy, who you would see only on these occasional forays, and his
27:56
one class, which was wonderful, basically this book, but it was really a lifetime
28:01
experience if you want to call it.
28:03
He had about six or seven students at the time.
28:06
He has had an amazing history of turning lots of people out, all with
28:12
sort of the same laissez-faire style.
28:23
A footnote to this thing was something Fred said, “By the way, if you are ever
28:25
in Oregon, stop by and say hello.” I
28:31
said, “If I get to Corvallis, I will do that.” But the following summer
28:35
I went out to Oregon and happened to be at the University of Oregon’s
28:40
campus, when a symposium on Mount St. Helens, which had blown up the
28:46
year before, was going to be held.
28:48
So, this must have been like
28:52
‘81.
28:54
I was told about it, and walked into a darkened room.
28:57
I couldn’t see who was giving the talk.
28:59
But it was a pretty interesting talk about the ecological and geomorphic
29:05
responses of the mountain and mountain side vegetation to eruption.
29:10
Lights come on, and it’s, Fred Swanson, and I thought “I know that guy!” So
29:16
we, after the talk, we got to talking.
29:18
And he said, “Well, I was interested in knowing what you’re doing, and why
29:22
don’t you come out to the field with us.
29:23
We are going up to look at this other river next week.”
29:28
So I tagged along, and by the end of that day, we had sort of reached some
29:33
kind of gentlemen’s agreement that said, if I wanted to do something
29:38
out in Oregon, I could do it and he would see to it that somehow, I
29:43
wouldn’t starve while I was doing it.
29:45
That’s really how I got back out here, I mean, that was really the connection that
29:53
launched me into the Andrews program.
29:56
Because I remember that spring when I came back out, when I finished my
30:01
course work at Hopkins, I came back out to start working on a dissertation,
30:06
sort of a vague notion that I was going to study something about the
30:10
effects of timber harvest on streams.
30:12
But I didn’t really know what exactly that was going to be.
30:15
Early on, Fred said, “Why don’t you come up, we are going to have a group
30:19
of students up at the Andrews.” Kind of like HJA Days, an early version
30:24
of that, and so this is, this is now ‘80-, it must have been ‘82, spring
30:29
of ‘82. So this is Jerry [Franklin] , Dick Waring, and Phil Sollins, and I
30:37
don’t remember Ted [Dyrness] being a part of it, but he might have been,
30:41
Dick Fredriksen and Dennis Harr.
30:44
It was a whole group of folks, and I remember standing in a circle in a parking
30:48
lot in Blue River, going around the circle and doing the name thing, and being really
30:57
impressed by the diversity of people and different disciplines represented
31:02
in the circle of students and faculty.
31:05
And it seemed like a big, friendly scene, pretty open in the sense that I could
31:14
just waltz in as sort of a walk-on from the east coast, and find myself there.
31:24
The main thing I found myself reflecting on was,
31:29
how do all these people manage to work in one place without
31:32
getting in each other’s way?
31:33
It seemed like there was one woman who was studying mammals,
31:38
small mammals and riparian zones.
31:40
Then there was someone else digging pits in riparian zones.
31:43
[Chuckle] It seemed like there were going to be all kinds of
31:45
problems, just getting them,
31:50
keeping the small mammals out of the pits.
31:54
I remember driving around up in the Andrews that day, and that slightly
32:01
nauseous state one gets in sitting in the back of a crowded van on logging roads,
32:07
you know, lots of un-washed bodies, and I remember again having that feeling I
32:17
had in Fred’s class, which was, “Well, I always do rivers and it doesn’t seem
32:20
like anyone else is doing rivers.” Then, I started running into guys like Stan
32:26
Gregory and Jim Sedell. I think Jim,
32:35
he had been on that first field trip I had taken, and he was doing fish things,
32:40
but clearly was invested some of the uses of habitat and what was defined
32:44
as “habitat” by people, that became the word I used to describe how what
32:49
I did fit into what everyone else did.
32:51
Because I was really focused on the physical structure and dynamics
32:55
of mountain streams, what I was beginning to get quite interested in.
33:00
That fit with my river guide background, and I’d spent a lot of time looking
33:04
at rapids, and thinking about how they formed and why they formed,
33:11
but the linkage for me seemed to be to talk about habitat because most
33:16
of the people in this group were not geomorphologists but were ecologists.
33:22
So there was a certain kind of learning process that goes on in terms of
33:28
learning how to couch something you are interested in a way that is accessible and
33:37
interesting to a larger group of people.
33:39
I think that is an important theme, I mean, I feel that to this day.
33:44
The constant challenge, particularly coming at it from the physical
33:49
science end, where it is not strongly represented in the Andrews group.
33:54
Fred,
33:56
and Ted [Dyrness] , I mean, there is a long history, in fact, as soon as
33:59
I got into learning some of the real history of the Andrews program, I
34:04
realized a lot of it was built around understanding basic physical processes
34:11
of watersheds, small watershed studies.
34:13
How this water sediment would move through these channel systems.
34:18
But it was not immediately obvious when we first started talking and
34:23
traveling around and watching Dick Waring shooting twigs out of a tree with a
34:28
shotgun, which I was very impressed by.
34:31
Even now, some of the woody debris stuff struck me as more ecology than physics.
34:39
And so, for me, it was really a learning process to start letting this broader
34:48
conception of an ecosystem intrude upon what has been, what has been at least in a
34:56
sense, very strongly of physics, you know, physics of rock and water and sediment.
35:03
And the geomorphic training is heavily orientated towards that,
35:09
because that tends to be those processes that are well represented by
35:14
engineering type equations and things.
35:17
So, a lot of the physics of rivers forms the bases for geomorphic
35:23
education, and ecology is always recognized as an influence.
35:28
But it is never really explored in that sense, at least it hadn’t been at that
35:34
time, with a couple notable exceptions.
35:35
There was a paper back in 1960 by Hack and Goodlett, contemporaries
35:45
of the guys that I had to report on.
35:47
Again, another serendipitous type thing.
35:49
Turns out to have been in that one paper which was about forestry
35:55
geomorphology in the Appalachians, they foreshadowed, I think, 50 years
36:01
of geomorphic and ecological work, much of which is now represented at
36:07
the Andrews.
36:08
I remember being very intrigued by the paper, because it seemed
36:11
to be a very integrated view of how the natural world worked.
36:16
I mean, you weren’t limited to just talking about when does
36:18
one rock turn over another.
36:20
You are really trying to see how the vegetation interacts at the level
36:24
of the land form with processes operating within this watershed.
36:29
And they really did a very nice job of that, and so I’m hearing echoes of their
36:34
work in this larger group discussion, and in my own attempts to try and merge my own
36:41
discipline-thinking with this large group.
36:44
Up until that point, you hadn’t really heard of much about the group
36:47
besides Fred [Swanson] ’s work,
36:51
and, sounds like maybe Jim Sedell.
36:51
Yeah, mostly Fred, Jim, and this guy named George, and I couldn’t
36:56
pronounce his last name, Lienkaemper.
37:02
At the time, I was very much on the lookout for papers and people
37:09
who were looking at questions about the effects of human timber
37:13
harvest activities on rivers and
37:21
watersheds.
37:21
I was aware that there wasn’t a lot or work, for something I had presumed was
37:26
a very well-documented area, I mean this was from my river guide days.
37:36
And one thing I didn’t emphasize, was that when I was at the University of Oregon,
37:39
I was very, very strongly involved with the outdoor community, which was really
37:47
the environmental community at the time.
37:49
People who were very interested in preserving the wilderness,
37:55
I had a very strong feeling about wanting to protect and preserve wilderness, and as
38:01
far as I could tell, the timber companies were raping and pillaging the land.
38:07
Everyone knew that that had to effect everything else, right?
38:12
Of course, it affected the fish, and the creeks were filling up with
38:16
sediment because this was happening.
38:18
I figured it was so much a part of the common parlance around these
38:23
issues, that as soon as one got into the literature, one would find
38:27
a basis for all these opinions.
38:30
Well, it turns out that I got into it and discovered that, no, there
38:33
wasn’t that basis at all, and in fact, very few people had actually looked
38:36
at it in any systematic kind of way.
38:39
What I became aware of, was that there was a distinction between the people who were
38:43
looking at it at a very small scale, and I put the Andrews work into that category.
38:49
That is, people who are interested in this little tiny creek.
38:54
You know, you log it, and see what happens.
38:57
That seemed to be something that was happening at the Andrews; you
39:02
use small watersheds for letting you look at the movement of
39:06
sediments, nutrients, or just water.
39:09
I became aware of the wealth of work that had already occurred along these lines.
39:14
But I was more interested in these larger channels, at least I thought I was.
39:17
As it turns out, my dissertation work was kind of betwixt and between the
39:23
larger channels that I had floated five years, and these little tiny things.
39:28
So, it’s kind of in the
39:32
meeting ground, sort of an intermediate scale, between the two [small and large]
39:37
. I really became aware of the Andrews work as being sort of micro-scale stuff.
39:43
But it was interesting, because as I talked with Jim [Sedell] and Fred
39:51
[Swanson] and Stan [Gregory] and others, I became aware that they too, were
39:53
interested in this larger scale, they just hadn’t done anything with it yet.
39:58
The work at that time, probably the work in Redwood Creek in northern
40:03
California which Fred seemed to be involved in, at least in a consultative
40:06
nature, was the largest enterprise that was looking at some of the big
40:11
channel issues and what became known as the issue of cumulative effects.
40:16
That’s really the question of how does the landscape level
40:24
series of what Reds Wolman referred to as insults, translate into
40:31
something that changes the channel.
40:34
That began to emerge as a key policy issue as well as a science issue, and the Clean
40:44
Water Act requires that you dealt with
40:51
that, as did NEPA, the National Environmental Protection Act.
40:54
And the federal agencies were just beginning to
40:59
grapple with how do you deal with cumulative effects, you know,
41:03
something which by its nature not the effect of one thing, but the whole.
41:10
My work was taking one aspect of that cumulative effect question, looking if
41:16
there is a kind of fingerprint or legacy manifestation of watershed impact in the
41:28
channels, inset within that larger role.
41:30
The Andrews work,
41:38
thought more of direct impacts as
41:44
opposed to cumulative impacts, which began to be featured,
41:45
was featured prominently as
41:52
a kind of thought experiment.
41:53
You know, people would say, “Well, let’s take a watershed, let’s say you
41:57
took Watershed 1 and you did it all over, then what?” They say, it became
42:03
a way of arguing from the smaller scale to the larger scale. And that’s
42:07
really where I began to encounter the Andrews work for the first time.
42:11
You said earlier that you at least had an understanding with Fred, that there would
42:15
be some funding from the Forest Service.
42:16
Is that right?
42:17
A pittance [Chuckle].
42:20
As it turns out, he managed to work some deal,
42:27
putting something together with what I was getting from Hopkins,
42:30
basically, cobbled-together.
42:32
Mainly, it was having an office, a place to sit down; room 363 [USFS Forest
42:37
Sciences Lab in Corvallis] , on a bench.
42:38
You know, just have a place to land, in which I could say I was doing
42:42
the science of rivers in Oregon.
42:46
That was really valuable, and beyond that, I began to realize was that it gave me
42:52
an entree into this whole world of other people who were doing this kind of work.
43:02
Had you had any exposure up to that point of other people working
43:04
for the PNW Station or Forest Service outside the Andrews?
43:10
No, my first exposure was coming here to this lab and sitting by the hallway
43:17
and getting introduced to guys like Dennis Harr and Logan Norris, and
43:30
it was the first time I had even been in a federal laboratory of any sort.
43:35
And I had all these misconceptions, some of them turned out not
43:39
to be misconceptions, about what federal laboratories are
43:45
like.
43:45
But it was interesting for me to be in a laboratory, where I had been in a
43:51
biochemistry laboratory before, and there was still that kind of work going on.
43:56
There was a water quality, a water chemistry, and a large pesticide effort
44:01
at that time, because of the interest in dioxins, that Logan was leading, the
44:09
effects of forest spraying on dioxins.
44:13
But I didn’t really know much about what went on in the lab.
44:18
I knew the people who were working on things; “He’s a chemist and is working
44:26
with spraying and the issues around that,”
44:33
but I didn’t really get a conception of the
44:40
breadth of the work.
44:40
It seemed too much of a headache to figure it out.
44:43
I mean, I was always impressed with guys like Fred [Swanson] or
44:48
Jerry Franklin who seemed to have in their minds, and Logan too.
44:53
Logan was project leader with the Forest Service.
44:59
And at that time, Jerry and the terrestrials were down on the second
45:03
floor under Jerry [Franklin] , and the water and stream physical types, plus the
45:11
chemists, were all marching under Logan.
45:13
It
45:16
was sort of the never-the-twain-shall-meet except when we would go up to the
45:20
Andrews and you would hear about these guys talking about this stuff.
45:23
The other thing that happened I remember, was that I went on one of
45:27
Jerry Franklin’s “pulses” to the Sierras.
45:29
That really was my
45:33
first really extended entree into the group.
45:38
That was three days in a van getting down to the Sierras and
45:43
camping out, it rained as I recall,
45:48
and a lot of time spent around the fire.
45:50
Art McKee, I remember being very impressed with his ability to
45:54
spin a yarn around a campfire.
45:56
And I was impressed by the overall friendliness of the group.
46:06
One of the issues with any kind of large group that has an identity and
46:14
a focus, is the question, how does it admit newcomers and outsiders, people who
46:19
had not been with the group up to that
46:23
point.
46:23
I found it to be a very permeable membrane, in large part because there
46:28
was an established conduit for graduates.
46:32
There was a graduate student experience that seemed to lend
46:38
itself well to bringing new
46:47
people in.
46:47
But I wonder if we are still doing that as well as we did back then.
46:51
I remember at the time, just feeling that there was a very effortless sort
46:58
of acceleration into this group thing.
47:00
But the other thing, I’ve never been much of a groupie kind of guy, and so,
47:09
if you’d asked me what I was doing and what group I was attached with,
47:12
I was probably more inclined to say Hopkins at that time, than I
47:15
would have said the Andrews program.
47:18
I didn’t put that “hat” on for a long time, and
47:28
a lot of it, I think there may have been some “disciplinism” attached to that.
47:33
I didn’t feel a natural affinity because of the number of other people
47:37
doing physical processes on rivers in my graduate school experience.
47:42
I mean, everybody was focused around doing rivers, or something like that.
47:48
Here, I was alone in my area with the exception of Fred, and Fred’s focus
47:51
was more ecological at that point.
47:54
He was clearly very interested in what I was doing, but he was doing
47:58
a lot of things on landslides.
48:00
No one else was doing physical processes of rivers.
48:03
And it is hard when you are a graduate student or even coming out of that role
48:08
where you sort of say, this is my turf, and I am going to make something happen
48:12
here and I was sort of doing that, but not with any real conscious intent to do so.
48:19
I mean, I was just trying to finish my dissertation.
48:21
Were there other graduate students there that you were working with
48:26
at all, or it sounds more like of a scientist that you were?
48:29
No, it was a mix.
48:31
I think Fred was definitely my major point-of-contact.
48:36
But I shared an office with Margaret [McHugh]
48:42
, another one of Fred’s students, who was working on landslides,
48:47
and I would meet other students who would sort of fade in and out.
48:54
Fred had a number of students who were going to finish “any day now” for several
49:00
years [chuckle] as I recall, and they would sort of appear and then disappear
49:04
again, go back into the woodwork.
49:08
But then, I began to establish some friendships with some of the people
49:13
in the ecology realm, and Gordie had been sort of the guy to get me
49:18
here, and he and I were friends.
49:21
But he was clearly into the fisheries end of things.
49:24
So,
49:29
my memory of my dissertation work was that I was going outside this group,
49:39
when I needed field assistance.
49:41
I would run an ad in the paper and try to get people to agree to spend a couple
49:47
days with me in mapping a creek, in exchange for some, you know, macaroni
49:53
and cheese and chanterelles, with maybe a bottle of wine to wash it down with.
49:57
That was that.
49:59
But I don’t recall having strong contacts, friendships, or
50:04
relationships with other students at that time.
50:09
In terms of recruiting assistance, sounds like at that time you
50:12
were operating pretty low budget for support in your research?
50:16
I was sort of at a low budget
50:21
level, and I just sort of pictured myself as having eked out some
50:25
little niche somewhere where I had enough to keep me alive,
50:33
trying to stay focused on finishing my degree.
50:37
Same time I had a long-distance relationship with Barbara,
50:41
my current, [chuckle] wife.
50:49
Part of what was happening as well, was that I would go back to visit
50:53
her, and some of those visits were extended visits of several months,
50:58
where I would also go back to Hopkins.
51:02
But it’s funny because there too, the community was changing, as most of the
51:06
people in my generation were out doing things like what I was, and there was
51:11
a new crop of graduate students coming up, so I became friends with them.
51:17
But that was a limited kind of exposure.
51:23
What facilities or resource needs did you have when you started
51:25
to work, in terms of things you actually needed to get the work done?
51:28
You mentioned the bench to sit down here.
51:30
Well, I’ll tell you.
51:31
See that?
51:34
Barbara gave that to me when I got my degree.
51:36
It is a little bit presumptuous with the degree thing, but, those tools you see,
51:45
are marble.
51:46
That is a silver compass, and that is a stadia rod, and that is about it.
51:53
That is what I used.
51:55
I was doing mostly mapping and some air photo work.
51:58
And it was really a very low-budget production.
52:04
The other thing that I got, the one facility that I
52:07
loved, was a word processor.
52:07
This was right when computers were
52:13
beginning to come on line.
52:16
We didn’t have computers around here for the first couple of years.
52:21
I mean there were computers, but you needed a card reader, and a computer
52:27
was something somebody else used.
52:30
But the idea of having a word processor, access to a word
52:34
processor, that was marvelous.
52:37
And then, shortly after that, the early PC’s and IBM’s
52:42
began to make themselves felt.
52:44
Then, when I discovered Lotus 1-2-3, hey, I was off.
52:50
So, that that was the other facility that really made things better.
52:58
And the other thing was
53:04
a resource, although it was not a physical resource, but
53:09
the field crew.
53:11
I was impressed by Al [Levno] , and Craig [Creel] [field technicians]
53:14
. George Lienkaemper was working for them, Ross Mersereau, and I
53:14
am forgetting names, but there
53:18
were
53:27
other people there.
53:28
Al and Ross and George; I was very drawn to that group.
53:35
Because these were guys who really enjoyed getting wet and going out and
53:39
doing things, and were very interested in streams and the whole work of keeping
53:44
the gauges going, the weather station going; really the core of their stuff.
53:52
And while I don’t recall using them directly, as they weren’t
53:59
so much a part of my research, I would stay in their cabin at night
54:05
when I came back to the Andrews.
54:07
So, there was a kind of osmosis that happened there, and I
54:13
began to realize these were guys that could solve any problem.
54:16
If I needed to figure out how to paint numbers on rocks so I could
54:22
measure them moving down stream and
54:26
the numbers would stay, these were guys that could figure it
54:31
out.
54:31
Why don’t you get a blow torch and dry them out, and then paint it.
54:34
You know, and they would come up with solutions like that for what ails you.
54:38
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your perceptions at that time of how the
54:48
Andrews compared with other experimental forests.
54:50
Had you
54:54
any previous experience with them?
54:55
That is an interesting question, but I had had no real exposure
54:59
to other experimental forests.
55:01
The one thing close that I had had a lot of exposure to
55:06
was Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
55:10
And Woods Hole is a science town.
55:13
You have to remember that my father was a biologist, I grew up in the
55:17
world of biologists, so to suddenly be in this world of ecologists,
55:22
there was a certain resonance there.
55:24
I recognized the type.
55:27
But Woods Hole,
55:33
I don’t know if you have ever been there, it’s sort of a scientific mecca.
55:36
It is what happens if you were to take a New England fishing village
55:41
and marry it to three major scientific enterprises, then add a tourist
55:49
ferry to take tourists to the island, all of this in a town smaller than
55:54
Philomath, a little tiny dot on the map.
55:59
Hole in the woods, right?
56:00
Well, it’s on the ocean.
56:02
I mean it’s a peninsula, it juts out, it is in the “armpit” of Cape Cod.
56:08
But a marvelous place,
56:12
particularly if you’re a boy.
56:14
The ocean is there, it is a warm ocean, you can swim in it, you can boat in it.
56:19
I mean, I got this major dose of boat [referencing love of water
56:23
craft] . But the reason it’s there, is
56:26
it’s got these major scientific laboratories there, the Marine Biological
56:30
lab, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Lab,
56:45
and Fisheries Service.
56:49
The town lives and breathes science.
56:51
I mean, you go to the beach and it’s just littered, you know, there will
56:54
be three Nobel Prize winners sitting in their baggy shorts eating peanut
56:58
butter and jelly sandwiches, it’s
57:04
that deeply steeped in science enterprise.
57:07
Students come in every summer, and so
57:12
that’s the model I had.
57:15
That’s what I was comparing the Andrew’s to, was that, what
57:19
really was fully-configured, big buildings and all the high-tech
57:25
sophistication of modern biology.
57:28
All the collecting boats I used to work on as a kid, and so there
57:34
would be field crews, sort of field technical people helping.
57:38
And so the Andrews was like a little tiny, tiny, tiny version
57:43
of this, stuck up in the trees.
57:45
That is what I thought of it, and the contrast was kind
57:51
of funny because Woods Hole,
57:56
you have a sense of this kind of lofty scientific enterprise.
58:00
The buildings are made out of brick, you walk in and there is a hallway that
58:06
has sort of been padded on by all the greats, in the field, you know, the
58:15
people you read about in the 1920’s and ‘30’s, these guys
58:19
have all done work in Woods Hole.
58:22
And so, you contrast that and the smell of dead squid and formaldehyde,
58:31
and ethanol in the halls to this
58:36
funky trailer stuck out in the woods that had been skunked the
58:41
summer before and hasn’t quite
58:46
lost its aroma.
58:47
It was a marvelous, but at the same time a somewhat off-putting contrast.
58:52
It slowly
59:02
began to dawn on me as I hung out at the place, that this was a microcosm
59:06
and maybe even the way the MBL [Marine Biological Lab] started and how
59:15
it got going.
59:18
But it was a slow realization that I was in on something which was already
59:24
clearly a going concern, you know, I had no role in getting it going,
59:29
but it still felt young and fresh.
59:33
Feeling like you contributed to the evolution of the place?
59:36
That is
59:39
right.
59:40
You had done some river guide work up there on the McKenzie River.
59:42
Had you been at all aware of the forest at that time?
59:46
I also imagine you went through Blue River?
59:48
Only in the sense of
59:53
having a feeling for the forest.
59:55
I mean, it was just a feeling, sort of an aesthetic sense of smell
1:00:00
and texture and rain and mist.
1:00:03
But,
1:00:06
I had been by the Andrews turn off road many, many times, but
1:00:12
I don’t recall ever having gone up there, and I didn’t really
1:00:18
have a sense of it,
1:00:23
that there was science going on in this river valley as well as everything else.
1:00:27
So for me, it has been an interesting experience.
1:00:30
I think about this sometimes because, the McKenzie, when I was a river
1:00:35
guide, was like my bread and butter.
1:00:36
The bread and butter river and so we would do,
1:00:42
I don’t know, 50, 75 day trips, a summer.
1:00:44
Driving that road was like, back of my hand.
1:00:49
I really knew that road.
1:00:52
And it was interesting to start driving that same road but taking the
1:00:58
turnoff and going off way over there.
1:01:01
I was aware that my life had taken a different direction than that.
1:01:07
But other than that, I hadn’t really thought much about what was going on.
1:01:10
Can you recall the communities along that road.
1:01:13
You know like Blue River itself, or McKenzie Bridge or
1:01:16
--? I remember Vi’s Pies.
1:01:18
There was a good pie shop, Doris’ Cafe, which burned down.
1:01:21
I remember, this goes back to my early year in Oregon, when I came in ’66.
1:01:32
Now I realize that was two years after the 1964 flood.
1:01:38
I remember some very early images of the McKenzie River from that time because my
1:01:45
family, they were all east coasters but my parents to their credit, really wanted
1:01:50
to give us some exposure to this new home.
1:01:54
We would take these Sunday drives, usually my father, for some reason or other, would
1:02:00
pick a reservoir we would go to visit.
1:02:01
We would go up and see Hills Creek reservoir.
1:02:02
We would go see Cougar Reservoir.
1:02:04
I mean, they were lakes, big, big lakes.
1:02:06
For all I know, we may have actually driven up to Blue River
1:02:10
Reservoir on one these long drives.
1:02:13
Which again, I remember mostly for fighting with my brothers
1:02:16
and sisters in the back seat.
1:02:18
But I remember driving along the river, and it was kind of wide and open.
1:02:24
I am not talking about communities now, but Blue River actually, what
1:02:28
I was thinking about was that there was some stuff happening on the
1:02:33
road around Blue River, that I think was part of what forced them to put
1:02:39
the highway outside town, because the old road used to go through
1:02:41
Blue River, and then they moved it.
1:02:45
I remember that when you drove up, when you drove the McKenzie, that you actually
1:02:50
drove through this town called Blue River, and at some point, there was a
1:02:53
lot of road construction, and then you didn’t drive through the town anymore.
1:02:57
I do remember the river was wide, it seems like there was a lot of gravel in it.
1:03:01
It
1:03:04
was easy to look out of your car window and see the river.
1:03:08
Now, it’s got vegetation around it and it is hard to see the
1:03:13
river, except in a couple places.
1:03:17
So, I realize now that what I was seeing was the aftermath of the flood in ‘64.
1:03:18
But at the
1:03:23
time it just seemed, that was just the river.
1:03:26
You mentioned that you were involved in some groups while you
1:03:29
were at U of O who were kind of interested in the natural world.
1:03:34
Had those groups been active in the valley at all?
1:03:39
Very interesting question.
1:03:41
The issue, the focal point, for those outdoor groups, was exclusively
1:03:47
wilderness.
1:03:49
Anything that wasn’t wilderness was sort of passed over, stuff
1:03:52
that you passed over to get to the wilderness, from what I remember.
1:03:57
And there was, it was never really talked about, but the wilderness
1:04:02
was considered to be so sacred, everything else was profane.
1:04:06
See, you
1:04:09
didn’t spend much time in the profane.
1:04:10
I mean, the profane was not that interesting.
1:04:13
What I wanted when I thought of rivers, was wilderness rivers, wilderness areas.
1:04:19
I wanted to protect wild and scenic rivers.
1:04:21
That was the motivation, everything was entirely focused on that.
1:04:25
That is an interesting point, because I remember for me to start working
1:04:30
in the Andrews in a place that had been logged and roaded and had lots
1:04:33
of people and history, I had to kind of swallow something to do that.
1:04:38
Because my instincts were all pushing me, in fact my dissertation
1:04:42
work, it is interesting because I
1:04:45
wanted to study the effect of human beings on rivers.
1:04:48
I did most of my work in a wilderness area, because
1:04:55
I needed a way of comparing streams in wilderness versus streams that
1:05:01
had been cut over, and there was no good description of what a mountain
1:05:06
stream looked like, whether in a wilderness area or in some place else.
1:05:10
So what I thought I needed to do was to go to a wilderness area
1:05:14
and establish a reference point, and then go somewhere else.
1:05:17
Well, I ended up spending most of my time
1:05:23
in the wilderness area, but
1:05:28
I distinctly remember the feeling for me, it was almost kind of a come down.
1:05:34
I had to come down from the mountain, the lofty mountain peaks and the wilderness,
1:05:39
to think about working in the Andrews.
1:05:40
I remember that even with Fred, and in Fred’s class, wanting
1:05:45
to talk about wilderness rivers and wilderness processes, and he
1:05:49
wanted to talk about logging, and I didn’t want to talk about logging.
1:05:54
That seemed liked more of what was screwing the world, and I
1:05:57
don’t want to talk about that.
1:05:57
So
1:06:01
it’s an interesting kind of thing, and I wonder if that’s still the case
1:06:05
for people, and I think one of the major changes in the way we think
1:06:09
about environmental issues is that we are more willing to view the human
1:06:16
issues as being geographically integrated in a place.
1:06:19
I was
1:06:30
just curious, as an undergraduate at U of O, if you might ever
1:06:36
noticed the difference in culture, going up the valley from Eugene to Blue
1:06:40
River, or did people there notice you?
1:06:45
They didn’t notice me that I know.
1:06:47
What I noticed, what I was most aware of going up on the
1:06:48
McKenzie, well, was the fishing.
1:06:48
That is what
1:07:02
I thought of when I drove up here, was a lot of people fishing.
1:07:07
I didn’t really think about logging.
1:07:09
I thought about fishing and I thought about, I knew, some people who had
1:07:17
a summer getaway home up there.
1:07:20
That is how I viewed these little dots of cabins going up the road.
1:07:25
These are getaway
1:07:28
homes.
1:07:28
I sort of view the McKenzie, and certainly my experience reflects that, was that
1:07:32
it was sort of a recreational place.
1:07:35
You know, people went fishing there or you went on the reservoir to go fishing.
1:07:38
So I don’t recall any feelings other than that about the environment.
1:07:45
When working on the dissertation, eventually you went back
1:07:47
to John Hopkins to finish?
1:07:54
Actually, I didn’t.
1:07:55
What happened, was
1:08:13
about 1985 or so, ‘84, ‘85, Dick Fredriksen, who
1:08:23
was a hydrologist along with Dennis Harr.
1:08:24
There were a number of people doing rivers.
1:08:26
Dick was one of them.
1:08:28
He was really the man behind the small watershed studies,
1:08:34
and he retired.
1:08:36
And that opened up his position, By this time Logan [Norris] had
1:08:40
left to go to the university, Dennis Harr was the project leader,
1:08:47
I was still not finished with my Ph.D., and they were looking to
1:08:52
find somebody who could come in behind, to sort of take Dick’s
1:08:58
job.
1:09:04
I remember Dennis saying to me at the time, “Would this be something
1:09:08
that you would be interested in?” I said, “Of course, yes.” He said,
1:09:08
“Well, we don’t know what we are
1:09:11
going to do, and there was some talk about having a broader search.”
1:09:15
But it’s interesting because
1:09:19
the stories about people sort of getting their jobs because they were in the
1:09:23
right place at the right time, and the “good ol’ boy system” sure worked.
1:09:28
That sort of happened for me, I was studying something considered to be
1:09:34
relevant, I was in place, I was a known quantity, and although I was a known,
1:09:42
I was known as a graduate student.
1:09:45
What I now realize is that people sort of had to take a chance.
1:09:51
Was I going to pan out or what?
1:09:56
It was very
1:10:01
unlike today, a very easy segue into a job.
1:10:06
There was a call for it, I applied for it, and I wrote the job description.
1:10:14
Dennis said, “What do you think this person ought to do?” And I said,
1:10:17
“Something about mountain rivers.”
1:10:22
[Chuckle].
1:10:22
It is interesting how many people do get their jobs that way, at least in the past.
1:10:26
I think it has broadened, and the nature of the job seemed to change,
1:10:30
so it is much harder to do that now.
1:10:33
Basically, it was, sort of show up, hang up, like Woody Allen says, “you show up.”
1:10:40
That is kind of what happened for me.
1:10:43
From that point on, from ‘85 on, who would you identify as being your closest
1:10:47
collaborator, people that you worked with mostly on a day to day basis?
1:10:51
Fred [Swanson] remains that to me,
1:10:55
and in some senses he has always been my closest collaborator in
1:10:59
this environment because of his disciplinary focus, and our long
1:11:05
history now, which is going on 25 years.
1:11:12
That has really expanded the last 10 years to include a much wider group.
1:11:18
But starting in ’85, it was Fred and George [Lienkaemper] , who at this
1:11:22
point was still in the field, but I think beginning to look other places to
1:11:30
be a professional.
1:11:33
Also, Jim Sedell somewhat.
1:11:35
Through Jim, I worked on one project in parallel with my dissertation
1:11:41
up on the Breitenbush River, and Jim was heavily involved in that.
1:11:51
Then Dennis, who was never really a close colleague, he was more of a presence.
1:11:58
Dennis was a singular guy, kind of a very spirited guy who did very good hydrology.
1:12:10
But
1:12:14
he enjoyed to joke as much as any man I ever met.
1:12:22
He once wrote an entire scientific paper as a joke, I mean, with fake references,
1:12:30
a major piece of work to craft this thing with this level of detail and precision.
1:12:37
I forget what it was about.
1:12:38
So,
1:12:41
Dennis and I would have great conversations, but I wasn’t that close
1:12:46
to him, really, in a collegial way.
1:12:49
In many respects, I wish that I had picked his brain a little
1:12:53
more than I did at the time.
1:12:54
He was more of a hydrologist.
1:12:57
I mean, he was doing water.
1:12:59
Part of it was my own tendency to put people in boxes.
1:13:03
Well there’s Fred, who was doing landslides, Dennis was doing
1:13:06
water, and I was doing channels, so it’s kind of interesting,
1:13:11
because in a group scene like this.
1:13:15
I’m just globalizing a bit, but in a group scene,
1:13:18
there really are two countervailing
1:13:28
instincts that are asked of participants.
1:13:32
You have to be able to speak with authority on at least one
1:13:40
area that is of general interest.
1:13:42
In Wolman’s words, you have to know something about something.
1:13:44
And so,
1:13:47
there is a kind of, I want to call it turf, but I don’t think people defend
1:13:53
it, although some of that goes on too.
1:13:57
It’s a domain, a plan of action, a portfolio, if you will, of issues and
1:14:05
tools and techniques and studies you have already done, or studies you are doing
1:14:09
now that defines your piece of the puzzle.
1:14:15
When you’re early on in a group, a lot of your struggles, and I suspect
1:14:20
this may be more true for men than for women, but I suspect this is true for
1:14:25
anyone trying to break into a group to define a turf or define a domain, and
1:14:29
it’s particularly difficult if there is somebody already in that domain, as there
1:14:32
is a lot of niche selection going on.
1:14:35
It’s an ecosystem, you come into that like a new organism trying
1:14:44
to figure out where it can go.
1:14:45
You find those places where you can feed and do your thing, while everyone
1:14:50
else does their thing in ways that don’t conflict and, and extract too much energy.
1:14:54
So, there is that going on and at the same time, you’re asked to, to sort of submerge
1:15:02
your own instincts, which might be to say, “Well, stream channels are the most
1:15:06
important thing in the entire universe, and everybody should pay attention.”
1:15:10
You have to sort of submerge that and say, “Wait a minute, there are other
1:15:14
people doing other things that are also interesting and relevant and important.
1:15:17
I have to listen and pay attention to them as well as ask
1:15:20
them to pay attention to me.”
1:15:24
That is something that comes with time, and
1:15:31
it comes with you as you grow confidence in your area, your own field, and your
1:15:36
own abilities, and then it becomes easier in some cases, to hear other people.
1:15:42
You don’t have always be out to prove yourself anymore, and in order for the
1:15:49
collective scene to work well, you have to have a critical mass of people who
1:15:53
are doing both; both supporting and sort of developing their own professional
1:16:00
“tap root,” but at the same time letting their branches intertwine,
1:16:04
if you don’t mind the metaphor.
1:16:07
You mentioned earlier that the pulse to the Sierras was kind of a point
1:16:14
where you kind of began to be part of that group, and so that ‘85 you already
1:16:18
felt pretty well intersected with them?
1:16:20
Yes and no.
1:16:21
I mean, it was interesting because of how things go, how to feel a part of a group.
1:16:26
You get invited to things, or you show up even if you’re not
1:16:30
invited, and they take you in.
1:16:33
It’s that kind of thing.
1:16:37
I never really lived for a summer at the Andrews the way some people
1:16:42
did, or lived for a year at the Andrews the way other people did.
1:16:47
It was more of a general agreement that if there was going to be an evening
1:16:53
party, or if there was going to be a
1:16:57
discussion, or a symposium about something, that one way you feel
1:17:05
a part of it, is if your piece of the action gets recognized.
1:17:09
You get on the agenda, you get face time.
1:17:12
At the Andrews, one thing I learned early on is that the field trip, which
1:17:20
was largely a process of sitting, driving around nauseous in a van,
1:17:26
getting out and having somebody stand in front of something and talk at you.
1:17:31
The Andrews field trips were of that sort.
1:17:35
That was a major mode of communication, so participation in those was what
1:17:44
I used as a metric of involvement or engagement.
1:17:48
Much more so than going to meetings.
1:17:50
I didn’t start going to the LTER meetings on any kind of regular way,
1:17:55
and I still do it irregularly, as I can take some of that in measured doses.
1:18:00
The
1:18:04
other thing that happened at the time, that was really the significant melding
1:18:10
event for me, was based on work that
1:18:17
Fred was doing and I was doing, including stuff spinning out of my Ph.D. research.
1:18:23
We got together with Stan Gregory and his troops, and put together a
1:18:29
second-generation riparian grant.
1:18:33
When I got out to the Andrews, the riparian one was a major focus, and
1:18:40
there was a lot of interest in this sort of “river continuum” idea.
1:18:44
Much of that work
1:18:49
escaped me.
1:18:50
That was going on around me, but I never really understood it, to be honest,
1:18:55
I mean, I never fully got the picture of what people were trying to do.
1:18:57
I would hear bits and pieces of it.
1:18:59
There was a lot of interest in organic matter cycling, and I remember
1:19:02
going out with Fred and Steve Cline.
1:19:06
They were interested in sticky wickets and how sticks sort of get smashed
1:19:11
together to form a debris jam, and they had some experiments going, and
1:19:15
people were dumping gingko leaves into streams to see how far they went.
1:19:21
Some of this seemed to me to be pretty
1:19:25
ecological.
1:19:26
I mean, again I was really focused on the physical stuff.
1:19:30
I didn’t quite get it all, the picture of what all this
1:19:35
different work was headed towards.
1:19:36
But then, I think it was ‘85, or so, maybe ‘86, somewhere in there, that grant ended.
1:19:44
There were some discussions we had been having up until, that started
1:19:47
happening as that grant was ending.
1:19:50
They were both acquainting people with what had been discovered, but
1:19:53
also sort of preparing for the next go-around, where the idea of using the
1:19:59
physical structure of the stream as an organizing principle, began to emerge.
1:20:04
Basically, the “Riparian One” in a nut shell, was, “You tell me what trees
1:20:09
are next to the stream and I will tell you what’s in the stream.” “Riparian
1:20:13
Two” changed that, saying, “You tell me about the geomorphic setting
1:20:18
the stream is flowing through, or creating the stream, and I will tell you what is
1:20:23
in the stream.” That was really the place.
1:20:25
So that was really for me, the coming together of the
1:20:30
physical and the ecological
1:20:34
in a grant, in a joint enterprise.
1:20:39
This was one that you helped write with Stan Gregory and
1:20:41
-- -- And Fred [Swanson] . And there were a lot of discussions that led up to that.
1:20:46
It was my first real exposure to grant-writing, and you have to
1:20:50
understand that when you’re a graduate student, you don’t know nothing, you
1:20:56
don’t ever get to see how people work.
1:20:58
How do you write a paper, how do you put a grant proposal together, how
1:21:03
do you do the basic stuff of science?
1:21:09
You learn that by osmosis, by hanging out with people, and so, for me,
1:21:14
what I got here, and it was probably the most important thing I got
1:21:19
here, was I got to watch how people did that, up front and personal.
1:21:23
I got to see it.
1:21:25
I got to see people having the discussions that led up to a grant proposal, and
1:21:29
as I recall I wrote some pieces of it.
1:21:33
My memory is that Stan [Gregory] really, really pushed it hard, and Fred
1:21:40
did as well.
1:21:40
If the LTER meetings weren’t that important, and in the sense that
1:21:42
the field trips were more, people talking about their work, where
1:21:45
did you get this exposure to this process that went into the groundwork?
1:21:52
Those were the meetings that I went to.
1:21:54
At the meetings, people would come and
1:22:01
talk about here’s what we did in Riparian One, what are we
1:22:04
going to do in Riparian Two.
1:22:06
And then, next meeting, come and put a little synopsis together of what you got.
1:22:12
You know, write, then I would see someone take those synopses and pull
1:22:17
them together into something, and write some text to go around it.
1:22:21
A lot of what I was doing, was watching how people wrote.
1:22:25
And one of the things that I really got, Fred [Swanson] particularly,
1:22:28
Fred was a great editor.
1:22:30
He would take my long-winded, rambling, unfocused prose and do something
1:22:36
with it, turn it into something that actually said what I wanted
1:22:40
it to say in about half the words.
1:22:42
He hasn’t been able to help verbal expression very much, but that’s
1:22:50
where I began to learn how, how you think science and how you really
1:22:55
do it in a day-to-day kind of way.
1:23:02
When you started out in the position that Dick Fredriksen left, you were coming
1:23:08
into the Forest Service at that point.
1:23:09
You got an appointment at OSU, a courtesy appointment, about
1:23:13
the same time didn’t you, about
1:23:17
‘85?
1:23:18
Another thing that was happening then is the first course that I took from Fred.
1:23:23
He was still teaching it over in the geoscience department, and early on
1:23:27
in my tenure here he asked, do you want to help me with the course?
1:23:30
So, I find myself suddenly helping to teach.
1:23:33
And it worked out pretty well because his course, he had done mostly landslides,
1:23:42
but some hill slope processes and some streams, and I came in with a very
1:23:48
strong stream orientation, but not knowing a whole lot about hill slopes.
1:23:52
So we began to sort of divide it.
1:23:55
He would take the hill slope and I would take the stream, and as a product
1:23:59
of that I began to learn how to teach,
1:24:04
which meant I had to learn it all over again.
1:24:08
And so I had been an instructor, I was a courtesy instructor in geosciences,
1:24:13
even before I got my degree.
1:24:17
And then that’s sort of translated through the years.
1:24:24
But, yeah, that was another thing that was happening.
1:24:27
I was curious, all the interaction you talked about this learning
1:24:31
process in grant writing.
1:24:32
I was wondering how much interaction with colleagues in programs in geology or other
1:24:38
programs, did you have on campus here?
1:24:41
Stan was my major point of contact at that time as I recall.
1:24:46
Bob Beschta
1:24:49
as well.
1:24:51
Bob?
1:24:51
Beschta.
1:24:52
In the Forest Engineering department [OSU] . That was in part because
1:24:58
in ‘85 or ‘86, we got the idea of putting together an international
1:25:05
symposium on erosion and
1:25:10
sedimentation in the Pacific Rim, in Corvallis.
1:25:17
Fred [Swanson] , Bob Beschta,
1:25:21
George Ice, and I, worked on that together.
1:25:24
That was really a one-and-a-half to two-year effort.
1:25:28
That was another sort of a learning crucible for me; how do
1:25:32
you put a meeting together, how do you think about a meeting.
1:25:38
So, I had some interactions with Bob around that, and scattered
1:25:45
interactions with lots of people throughout my tenure here.
1:25:49
I just don’t remember any really
1:25:53
close, on-going,
1:25:58
involvement with anyone other than Fred.
1:26:02
One of the things clear to me early on was that the distinction
1:26:05
between the Forest Service and the university, was a very subtle one.
1:26:10
Basically, I saw Fred and people like Logan [Norris] , treating their jobs with
1:26:18
the Forest Service the way I would imagine anyone at the university treats their job.
1:26:25
That was modeled for me as
1:26:29
the way one conduct’s one’s self.
1:26:31
That felt very comfortable for me.
1:26:32
I was quite used to the academic lifestyle, and
1:26:39
I felt, given my background, working for Forest Service Research was
1:26:45
never exactly what I had in mind.
1:26:48
I always pictured going out and getting an academic job somewhere,
1:26:55
and continued to think I should apply
1:27:02
for jobs in addition to that after I got my Ph.D., but began to realize that it was
1:27:11
not the best path forward.
1:27:11
I could do as much research as I wanted to, or as little, [chuckle],
1:27:15
but did as much as I wanted.
1:27:17
But I could also have a university presence, and I could teach.
1:27:23
And so,
1:27:26
all of that contributed to my
1:27:33
sense of what it meant to be a scientist, and I didn’t define that
1:27:37
by university or non-university.
1:27:41
I think the theme for me was one of slowly pushing my head above the
1:27:49
murk of being a graduate student and thinking like a graduate student.
1:27:55
When you think like a graduate student, you think about
1:27:57
your world and your universe.
1:28:00
I was aware there were lots of people thinking broader than
1:28:04
that, thinking about a group.
1:28:07
I began to think a little bit like that, but mostly I still thought
1:28:10
about myself as a graduate student.
1:28:11
And it’s been a slow process, which is on-going, to think more broadly and
1:28:17
globally about the group as an entity to which one has personal responsibility.
1:28:27
That’s emerged only with time.
1:28:30
It isn’t something
1:28:33
you just do, and I can see
1:28:36
institutional
1:28:40
forces that could make that either easy or hard.
1:28:46
In this setting, my experience with it was really easy.
1:28:52
The environment we lived in was so loose and flexible, that it was entirely
1:28:58
possible to be working for the Forest Service, to have close connections with
1:29:01
the university, and to be doing things which might have looked to the outside
1:29:07
world as if they were coming from the university, even though they were
1:29:09
coming through Forest Service Research.
1:29:10
And nobody cared.
1:29:11
Now, that has changed.
1:29:14
That is still one of the most significant changes in my professional
1:29:17
career, those distinctions have begun to play more of a role, and there
1:29:24
are pluses and minuses to both ways.
1:29:26
At the time though, I was just really impressed by the
1:29:30
fluidity of the work environment.
1:29:32
Largely that was because of guys like Fred [Swanson] and Jerry [Franklin]
1:29:36
. Jerry was really central, as was Logan [Norris] . I think Logan was
1:29:39
really a key guy in terms of helping people adopt a “just do it” mentality.
1:29:46
I mean, just do it,
1:29:50
don’t break any laws, don’t get people pissed at you, but just do it.
1:30:00
Jerry certainly operated out of that philosophy, Fred and Dennis too.
1:30:06
Dennis Harr is another example of that loose
1:30:12
leadership style.
1:30:13
I think that is very important.
1:30:15
I think that probably is one of the major ingredients that
1:30:18
made the Andrews work early on.
1:30:22
Was Logan Norris department chair when you got here?
1:30:24
No, he was project leader.
1:30:26
He did what Fred’s job is now.
1:30:28
Then, there was Dennis [Harr] , and then he went over to university.
1:30:33
But the
1:30:36
thing that always impressed me about Logan was the very thoughtful
1:30:42
and intelligent take he gave on things, and with good instincts.
1:30:47
I mean, good feeling for where “the line” was.
1:30:50
That’s one of the things you had to be aware of, was you just couldn’t
1:30:54
do anything you wanted, but you had to pay attention, for example,
1:31:01
there are issues out there in the world, and you can pretend
1:31:07
you’re not interested in them, but then, they come in and get you.
1:31:15
It’s a much better philosophy to be attentive to what is going on.
1:31:21
You think, “What if this thing sort of
1:31:25
burbles up into a major kind of thing? What can I be doing now that
1:31:29
is going to put me in the right place if that happens?” They are
1:31:34
gambles, and you have to trust your instincts and what your intuition
1:31:39
tells you is going to be something important versus something that is not.
1:31:42
But, that seemed to be working back then.
1:31:47
There were various issues that were burbling along.
1:31:51
Someone I haven’t talked about but was another undercurrent, to try and
1:31:54
paint at this time, is the policy.
1:31:56
I presume that
1:32:00
this is something relevant to this discussion, but
1:32:07
the policy context for all of this work was another piece of the learning
1:32:13
curve for me, personally, and in retrospect, is what I now recognize
1:32:20
as one of the most salient aspects of the whole environment around
1:32:28
here.
1:32:31
Early on, I came into the game thinking, well, I am going to drive
1:32:35
a stake through the heart of the timber companies, proving that
1:32:39
they’re raping and pillaging the land.
1:32:41
Now, I had some notion what this was, the sort of issues motivating this work.
1:32:48
Then, as I watched Logan deal with the spraying [herbicides] issues, I became
1:32:56
aware, no pun intended, how volatile the environment around forest issues was or
1:33:06
could be.
1:33:06
In general, the arena I was
1:33:11
in seemed to be fairly sedate by comparison.
1:33:18
Old growth, or forest protection issues, were really key, but for
1:33:24
the most part these were framed very broadly in terms of protecting old
1:33:29
trees and old growth and old forests.
1:33:32
And as the ‘80’s went on, the birds were attached to that, and then,
1:33:38
fish and other things as well.
1:33:39
And
1:33:42
there was always a line in these things about how cutting trees
1:33:45
causes sedimentation which fills up the gravel for the fish.
1:33:50
Again, as if this is known to everybody everywhere.
1:33:57
Incidentally, I should mention that one of the products of my Ph.D. research,
1:34:01
is that I had a devil of a time finding streams that were radically
1:34:08
different as a result of timber harvest.
1:34:11
This was one of the big come-uppances for me, is that I expected to find that
1:34:17
cutting trees turns everything blue.
1:34:19
[Chuckles] I couldn’t find blue streams, you know,
1:34:25
metaphorically-speaking.
1:34:26
The policy issues out there emerged for me mostly around this issue
1:34:34
of cumulative effects, that the agencies of National Forest systems
1:34:38
were beginning to try to work out.
1:34:41
I found that my colleagues and relationships developed with people,
1:34:48
often with other researchers, sort of in my position but at another laboratory.
1:34:57
Like Redwood Sciences Lab, in [Arcata] California, is another lab where there
1:35:01
is a much higher concentration of people actually doing river-watershed
1:35:05
type-of-processes, and here
1:35:09
also with people who were actually on national forests themselves, working
1:35:14
to solve these problems, or people who were regional hydrologists.
1:35:20
So a lot of my professional work and linkages, and the transfer of the
1:35:25
science, was directed towards that, as opposed, for example, towards students
1:35:31
or the university, for my career.
1:35:35
That just turns out to have foreshadowed what really began to coalesce in the
1:35:41
late ‘80’s as critical policy issues formed around, certainly fish, and
1:35:49
the relationship between physical processes and fish habitat, became
1:35:55
more and more of a concern, and people began to discover more and more about
1:36:00
linkages between forests and logs, and logs and streams, and logs and fish.
1:36:05
And this again is what started in many cases, or at least was really given a
1:36:11
boost, by the early Andrews’ reports.
1:36:13
So people coming back ten years later, and really emphasizing these issues.
1:36:22
There was a big meeting in Seattle, I remember, in ‘87, in which a lot
1:36:28
of this forest-fish interaction was really being highlighted.
1:36:32
And it was the same meeting, you know, they had the same meeting in ‘92,
1:36:36
and we were commenting at how some people may have not even taken their
1:36:40
slides out of their trays from ‘87, there was a lot of the same stuff, so
1:36:45
this was becoming much more current.
1:36:49
But it
1:36:52
began to be manifest a number of different ways, as the old-growth issues really
1:36:57
got booming, and guys like Jerry Franklin began talking about “new forestry,”
1:37:02
and asking, what does this mean?
1:37:05
I saw some real implications,
1:37:09
some of the effects on hydrology, on sediment and wood and so forth.
1:37:16
Some of my work was orientated towards trying to bring some
1:37:19
of these issues out, but it’s
1:37:25
really been the ‘90’s when these watershed things have just gone, “ka-boom,” and
1:37:32
the complete merging of the fish issues into the forest protection issues.
1:37:38
The recognition of the fish problems has been regional in scope,
1:37:43
sort of mega-regional in scope.
1:37:46
And then the major science assessment effort and strong role
1:37:54
in the fish issue there,
1:37:57
that really brought this policy, set it with these policy issues,
1:38:06
out and into the open.
1:38:10
In terms of these issues [hydrology and forestry] , were there people at
1:38:13
the region or district that you have worked with in terms of those issues?
1:38:15
Yes, guys that were
1:38:19
early regional hydrologists.
1:38:23
These were people I would need to interact with at meetings, like Jerry
1:38:29
[Swank] , Dallas Hughes, and Jerry [Christner] , early on at the Willamette
1:38:34
[National Forest] , a major entrée for me.
1:38:38
Jerry Christner was really a key guy, in fact, during my dissertation,
1:38:43
he played a very important role,
1:38:49
helping me develop it.
1:38:49
There was a whole bunch of guys from California, John Rictor,
1:38:59
the Redwood Science people, Dick [Janda] , Harvey Kelsey, other geomorphologists, but
1:39:07
Dick Janda was a major influence for me.
1:39:11
Where was he?
1:39:11
Originally, he was with
1:39:14
the Redwood National Park, and then he moved to the U.S. Geological Survey,
1:39:19
and eventually to Vancouver, Washington.
1:39:23
He was a guy who
1:39:26
was very
1:39:30
focused in his professional world on the relationship between understanding
1:39:35
and using basic geological principles, then translating them into ways that
1:39:43
could be interpreted and understood by policy makers and the public-at-large.
1:39:48
He did this in Redwood [National] Park, when he argued for the expansion
1:39:52
of the park to include trees outside of the place that was being eroded,
1:40:00
as a watershed protection measure.
1:40:01
He was very involved in the [Mount] St. Helens issue, and was a close
1:40:07
colleague of Fred Swanson as well.
1:40:11
I should add a side note.
1:40:13
St. Helens was a place for me, that although aware a lot of stuff
1:40:17
was happening, because it came on line in ‘80, ‘81, while I was
1:40:23
still back at Hopkins, I only got in on kind of the tail end of that.
1:40:28
So, I missed a lot of the bonding that happened around the St. Helens experience.
1:40:33
I was very aware, that for guys like Stan [Gregory] , Fred, George [Lienkaemper]
1:40:37
, Jerry Franklin, and others, that this was really a major thing.
1:40:41
Interactions between Jerry, Fred, and Stan; a lot of development of
1:40:45
ideas happened in that crucible.
1:40:47
I kind of came in at the tail end of that.
1:40:49
I did a little bit of work up there, but nothing that amounted to much.
1:40:54
Dick [Janda] had been very much a piece of that, and I think the policy issues
1:40:59
around the park, he continued with that.
1:41:03
So he was kind of a role model for me, for how you start thinking about these
1:41:07
issues, and how you think about the policy implications at the same time
1:41:16
that you are doing the science.
1:41:17
Let me just add something.
1:41:18
The work I did with Jim Sedell on the Breitenbush River became
1:41:22
involved in a lawsuit again over this cumulative-effects issue.
1:41:26
So, I had my one and only experience being dragged into court as a
1:41:31
reluctant, what do they call it, hostile witness, and which was actually quite
1:41:41
interesting, because I was in the position of having information which
1:41:47
I thought was potentially useful
1:41:52
to the plaintiffs in this case who were suing the government over
1:41:57
logging in the Breitenbush River.
1:41:59
Who were the plaintiffs?
1:41:59
There was the Breitenbush community, and then
1:42:05
the Sierra Club might have been involved, and there were a couple others, but
1:42:15
they sued to stop logging, sort of around this cumulative-effects issue.
1:42:21
That was for me, a real singular event of being sort of pulled into
1:42:29
policy issues, having them overtake a place where I had just been doing
1:42:31
work on when the logs move in streams.
1:42:34
I hadn’t been studying this cumulative effect issue at all,
1:42:37
in fact, in this place, but I have been overtaken by circumstance.
1:42:41
So that taught me, A] That that can actually happen, B] When that happens,
1:42:45
you sort of lose control of it, and C]
1:42:50
It’s a pretty squirrelly process.
1:42:53
Hard to ride, hard to know what is going on, happens quick, lots
1:42:57
of surprises, people don’t always act rationally, or diplomatically.
1:43:05
There was a steep learning curve about some of the follow-up on
1:43:09
policy, and what happens when you get too close to that business.
1:43:13
That was in the legal arena, but then that also showed up, for example, in
1:43:18
FEMAT and other instances, I saw a lot of the same behaviors down the road.
1:43:28
How would you describe the situation getting out of
1:43:31
your control in that lawsuit?
1:43:33
Just
1:43:36
that I remember,
1:43:40
for example, we had been asked to have phone conversations with people
1:43:46
who were interested in pursuing this suit from the plaintiff’s side.
1:43:51
And I would send them papers, four or five, done.
1:43:55
I always ran to Fred, and asked, “Fred can I do this?” He said, “Yeah, it’s
1:43:59
published, it’s public, you can send it.” And I didn’t really have a huge
1:44:04
agenda there, I was just interested to see what was going to happen.
1:44:10
But I also felt that they could reasonably pursue a case, that there
1:44:14
was some evidence that suggested logging had had some effect
1:44:18
here, unlike some other places.
1:44:21
I began to be aware that these guys didn’t seem to know a whole a lot about
1:44:26
what they were talking about, I mean, they were just sort of using these
1:44:29
papers as clubs, as if, literally, you rolled them up and hit people with them.
1:44:34
Without really understanding the details, and maybe you didn’t need to, but it
1:44:37
seemed to me that there was more of a use if you actually understood and read them,
1:44:42
than if you just used them as a club.
1:44:45
Then there were other issues.
1:44:47
For example, I got subpoenaed to give oral testimony, and just being
1:44:53
in that room with people trying to extract information from me with a
1:44:58
lawyer who was trying to keep me from giving information, for the government.
1:45:02
Then my own instincts, which were just focused on trying to figure
1:45:05
out what it was I thought about the questions as they came at me, and then
1:45:11
sort of going one direction, and having the guy sort of switch the questioning,
1:45:14
go from some having to give some very general statements about how rivers work,
1:45:21
to being asked, “And all of this would be true about the Breitenbush River,
1:45:24
would it not?” I said, “Wait a minute, I have been talking very generally here,
1:45:28
I would have to talk --” The lawyer said, “Well what wouldn’t be true?”
1:45:30
“We have just talked for two hours?” and “We will read it back to you.”
1:45:34
Suddenly, you realize you’ve sort of
1:45:38
been led down the primrose path, and
1:45:41
I was naïve in the way I was dealing with it.
1:45:45
Just being aware that once that happens, the rules of science and
1:45:50
scientific rational discourse, looking at and weighing the evidence,
1:45:56
doesn’t apply enough in a court setting very much.
1:45:58
It probably does, maybe at the very end, but everything leading
1:46:02
up to it is a battle and a fight.
1:46:05
A lot of policy issues have this sort of military model in them
1:46:10
with battle metaphors attached.
1:46:14
And it took me awhile, and I am still learning, how do you talk from the
1:46:22
point-of-view of a scientist in the context of where your work is embedded
1:46:28
in this highly-charged, polarized environment, where your words can
1:46:34
easily be taken out of context.
1:46:36
Where some part of you might even want your words taken out of context.
1:46:40
I mean, how do you handle yourself in that setting?
1:46:44
How do you not overstep your bounds?
1:46:46
I think that I have become very, very
1:46:52
sensitive to that issue, and I think it’s really important not to overstep
1:46:58
one’s bounds, and it is so easy to do, and scientists are given many
1:47:07
unbridled or unchecked opportunities to express themselves in some cases.
1:47:13
There is still some lingering respect for the profession, but it is easily eroded
1:47:18
and I think if people will overstep it,
1:47:23
the complete loss of respect for the scientific enterprise vastly outweighs
1:47:30
whatever small gains one can make towards what you think on any particular issue.
1:47:34
I think it is really critical for people to take it serious.
1:47:38
But we are getting afield here.
1:47:42
Actually
1:47:42
-- Maybe we ought to take a raincheck here, because
1:47:45
-- Do you have a meeting coming up?
1:47:47
Not in the next while, I don’t know how long you want.
1:47:50
I’ve been wandering, I feel like I have been wandering all over the map here.
1:47:53
You covered a lot of the turf I wanted to cover, but in a different
1:47:55
order than I planned, so it’s good.
1:47:57
Means you have to go back though and try and resume it.
1:48:00
Not a major problem, but I probably
1:48:03
could use another hour, but we don’t have to do it today if you would rather.
1:48:06
However, I did want to follow up here on one thing here.
1:48:09
My suggestion would be, if you didn’t mind, because there are a couple fires,
1:48:14
imminent fires that are brewing in policy lines that I sort of have to deal with,
1:48:20
and I’m delighted to talk with you.
1:48:23
You ask good questions, and mainly, you put up with my rambles.
1:48:28
There is one thing that I want to get before I forget.
1:48:29
And present the question, and then we
1:48:36
will check the calendar.
1:48:36
I was just thinking, if your kind of experience you had over the
1:48:41
Breitenbush, affected the way in which you think of yourself as a
1:48:44
scientist and who your audiences are?
1:48:46
Who do you write for when you write an article?
1:48:49
Do you think that changed at all since that experience, or maybe you
1:48:54
should, in general terms, describe what your audience is when you write as a
1:49:04
scientist?
1:49:04
That’s a very good question, Max.
1:49:07
Let me reflect on that.
1:49:09
I’ll tell you my instinctual reaction, and as I am talking about
1:49:14
it, let me edit some of my words.
1:49:19
My model for scientific writing has always been books like this, from Reds Wolman.
1:49:29
I was told by my advisors, in a sense I had two advisors,
1:49:34
Wolman and I had Swanson.
1:49:38
Reds [Wolman] said to me, “You know,
1:49:45
you write every paper as if it’s going to be a U.S. Geological Survey
1:49:50
professional paper.” Which is sort of a cream of the crop, or “You write every
1:49:54
paper that is going to be a journal article.” I haven’t always followed
1:49:59
that advice, but the model he gave was that you want everything you do, every
1:50:05
talk you give, every paper you do, to be oriented towards the best in the field,
1:50:13
and the audience you’re writing to as a scientist, is mostly an audience
1:50:16
of your peers, of other scientists, of other people who are interested
1:50:22
about the same things you are.
1:50:25
I
1:50:28
have always tried to hold to that because I think that that’s ultimately
1:50:34
the court of last resort in what we do.
1:50:37
That it is much more important in the long run to be writing for the
1:50:41
scientific community, not because science is some kind of god, or I
1:50:47
don’t have a shrine in my house, and I don’t worship at the altar of science.
1:50:53
It’s a process, and it’s an imperfect process, but it is one of the better
1:50:57
processes human beings have come up with for figuring out how the world
1:51:01
works, how the universe is put together.
1:51:04
And there are certain rules about how the process works, and rules.
1:51:08
There’s got to be repeatability and verifiability,
1:51:14
doing things rigorously, and thinking things through.
1:51:18
I mean, these are sort of the basic rules, and I think those are principles
1:51:23
that I have always tried, but not always been successfully, to cleave to in
1:51:27
my writing and in my public speaking.
1:51:32
The Breitenbush didn’t really change that, but it made me increasingly
1:51:36
aware, and I’ve grown, of
1:51:43
the curious environment in which a
1:51:48
number of us here do science, compared to, say, the way my father does science.
1:51:52
I mean he’s doing developmental neuro-biology,
1:51:59
and he’s working on some model of how a system works.
1:52:04
He thinks it’s a good model, but maybe it won’t pan out, and he’ll
1:52:08
do some experiments and figure it out, and write a paper one way or
1:52:12
the other, and no one really cares, except other people in the field.
1:52:16
That is about who he’s writing to.
1:52:19
But, it’s never going to show up in the newspaper.
1:52:24
That’s different here.
1:52:26
That’s one of the most distinctive differences.
1:52:29
We’re much more in the public eye because of the nature of the issues
1:52:33
we work on and because of the level of interest the public has of those issues.
1:52:38
And so, when I write a paper, I now have to remember that it’s read by
1:52:45
lots of people, including lots of people without any training from
1:52:49
the field I am in.
1:52:54
And
1:52:57
I have not fully, to use a word out of the sixties, “grokked,” and
1:53:03
what that means, but I have come to respect it, and I have come to rue
1:53:10
it.
1:53:11
I co-authored a paper with Julia Jones, a year-and-a-half ago, and it came out.
1:53:17
And you refer to it euphemistically, as the paper from hell.
1:53:22
I think it’s a good paper, but I don’t think that if
1:53:28
had a real appreciation for who was going to read it, how they were going to
1:53:32
read, how it was going to be used, and how it was going to be misused, there
1:53:36
is a lot more that I would have said.
1:53:39
Fortunately, I have another shot at it.
1:53:42
I have other papers that I can write and other things on that issue.
1:53:45
But
1:53:48
that paper, probably more than any other, has convinced me of this
1:53:51
business of who do you speak to, who do you write to, and the much broader
1:54:01
range of people you have to keep in mind when you’re writing.
1:54:06
That’s a lesson I think others have learned at other points in their career,
1:54:15
and for me, it’s been a growing awareness, rather than any one thing,
1:54:19
although this paper on issues surrounding the recent floods just catapulted
1:54:25
the work we do into the spotlight.
1:54:29
At least for, you know, its 15 minutes of fame.
1:54:33
Who did you write the paper for?
1:54:35
The paper was published in Water Resources Research, the
1:54:39
main
1:54:43
hydrology and water journal.
1:54:48
I mean, you would be amazed how many people have gotten a copy of that paper.
1:54:53
I don’t know how many have read it.
1:54:54
But a lot of people have read it, and a lot of people don’t understand
1:54:57
what’s in it, even people who should understand what’s in it, don’t understand.
1:55:00
I don’t fully understand it, I mean it’s a complex paper.
1:55:05
But
1:55:10
it’s brought the lesson home to me, that in this field, at this time, you cannot
1:55:18
pretend that you’re just writing for you scientific peers, because you’re not.
1:55:23
And again, that is something that no one teaches you in graduate school.
1:55:29
It’s only through experience, and only through certain types of experiences,
1:55:33
that you, you get that feeling.
1:55:35
And I don’t know how it’s going to
1:55:42
play out.
1:55:42
One of things I try to do and I’ve put a lot of effort into it the last
1:55:48
couple of years, is now I deliberately write for non-scientific audiences.
1:55:54
I write for the newspaper, I will take it upon myself or working with Fred
1:56:00
or others to put together an opinion piece so that I have an outlet, and so
1:56:06
that I can clearly try to articulate, what I hope are ways of thinking
1:56:13
about the papers when they come out.
1:56:19
That’s part of what I am trying to do is help people understand it so
1:56:23
that when you see a paper about this, here’s how you might think about it
1:56:26
rather than just sort of using it or misusing it one way or the other.
1:56:29
Seems like a preface to your actual scientific work; what you are going to
1:56:33
publish, not what you have published.
1:56:34
Well, it’s both.
1:56:36
It’s trying to bring a broader audience along with what I view as
1:56:41
really an on-going improvisation around multiple scientific scenarios.
1:56:47
That’s how I see my work.
1:56:49
I think of it in, coming from a musical perspective, having music in my past,
1:56:54
I think of it in many respects as a theme, a major, there’s clearly some
1:57:02
major themes, but there is a lot of variation and a lot of improvisation.
1:57:06
A lot of it is seeing things that could be done, or you know, have some ways
1:57:15
of pushing this a little bit further, getting something useful out of it, and
1:57:21
then trying to bring people along both into the importance of the
1:57:26
theme itself, the themes themselves, but then also trying to focus and
1:57:31
help people understand how these different variations kind of play off.
1:57:37
Well maybe we should call a halt here, it sounds like we’ve
1:57:40
got to reschedule here anyway.
1:57:40
Um, do you have a time that would work for you?
1:57:43
Sure.
