00:02
Some of the
00:33
things you were talking about last time were really good, and I wanted
00:35
to pick up where we left off.
00:37
You were talking about what you considered to be your audience, the types of
00:40
research and writing, and if I recall it right, you were talking about your
00:46
current efforts to deliberately target outlooks in popular media, kind of warn
00:52
general publics about the research that is coming out before it actually hits
00:56
the scientific press, as you called it.
00:59
Maybe you could talk about what you consider to be the most critical ideas
01:04
and issues for people to consider about the kind of work you’re doing at the
01:13
Andrews and elsewhere.
01:14
I just want to clarify one thing that I was reflecting on, a lot of what we
01:18
were talking about last time was me.
01:22
And I was
01:28
I was taking what you were asking as questions involving my
01:32
individual perspective on the thing.
01:36
I didn’t have a corporate hat on and tried and articulate the Andrews
01:41
program or anything like that.
01:43
I assumed that’s by design on your part as well, that your job is synthesizing.
01:49
I
01:56
have absorbed enough of the ethos around here that I can’t clearly distinguish
02:01
what’s my perspective from a broader group perspective, an interesting thing about
02:06
what happens in this kind of setting.
02:09
One begins to take on a kind of group, a group-think, it becomes
02:14
a part of one’s own thinking.
02:15
But I was reflecting upon our conversation before, realizing that a lot of it was,
02:19
I’m talking about my own background, my own sort of way about going at it,
02:22
so I’m sort of leaving it to you in that case to tease these things apart.
02:28
Yeah that is exactly what I am looking for.
02:30
I would be frankly, kind of worried, if someone stood up and said,
02:34
“This is what the group thinks.”
02:35
Yeah,
02:38
right.
02:39
So the question you posed,
02:44
what are the critical issues that people, that I think people ought to be looking
02:48
at and thinking about with respect to my work and perhaps the broader Andrews work.
02:56
Is that right?
02:57
Right, and if you think about how your work has evolved from maybe 1985 to
03:00
the present, what you have learned in that period, and what are the critical
03:03
issues or content that people would need to understand about the current
03:05
work is and what the concerns are.
03:10
Good question, let me think
03:22
about
03:26
it a minute.
03:26
When you ask someone in science a question,
03:31
you typically get an answer that can be more confusing than the original question.
03:40
And so, one of the things I think we do, I know I do that personally, in
03:47
respect to a lot of the forest issues,
04:01
when people ask that if I was given a chance to stand up in front of a million
04:09
people, sort of, what would you say.
04:12
To say, “Well, stop, people.
04:14
Here’s what I think you should think about.”
04:18
I think the basic theme that comes through and that I try to articulate, is that
04:27
issues are a little more complicated than you may perhaps have been lead to believe,
04:39
and that doesn’t mean that it’s unapproachably complicated.
04:44
Or
04:48
what I try to communicate is, and what I would like people to understand
04:52
is, if you will give me a little bit of your time, I may be able to
04:59
help you think this thing through.
05:02
But at least give you some perspectives that you might find useful in your
05:05
own thinking and musing about it.
05:08
That is a very broad statement, but
05:12
it applies almost across the board to any specific issues I can think of
05:18
that are focal points in the Andrews.
05:23
I think a lot of what we are trying to communicate is a little flavor of
05:29
the complexity of natural systems,
05:32
and that flavor is
05:39
an antidote to simple,
05:45
syllogistic and polarized thinking, which has been one of
05:52
the dominant characteristics of the debate about the use of forests,
05:58
and the whole issue of how are we going to manage our forests into the
06:04
future So what I feel myself doing is reacting in a sense to the framework
06:12
which a lot of our work is conducted within this larger, polarized debate.
06:22
Are we going to cut the trees or are we going to leave them?
06:25
Are we going to have jobs or owls?
06:27
Are we going to have fish or
06:30
economic development?
06:33
That’s the kind a very simple,
06:37
polarized view, and if you shine the light on anybody in the debate, they’ll go, “Oh,
06:43
we recognize it’s more complicated than that.” But at the point you’re talking to
06:47
large audiences, almost inevitably, what you are speaking against is that backdrop
06:54
or context of this polarized thinking.
06:58
So I view my role as a scientist is to bring some of the flavor of complexity
07:06
and uncertainty, including uncertainty around those things for which a lot of
07:14
people have already made up their minds.
07:18
This reflects back to some things that we were talking about in the last session.
07:21
When I got started in my work, I knew that we could go up there and find
07:27
all kinds of evidence of stuff that had happened because we had logged
07:32
the hell out of these landscapes.
07:34
I just knew it.
07:37
And the more I looked into it, the less convinced I was that this was
07:42
going to be a simple process of showing
07:47
egregious environmental damage.
07:51
There was egregious visual damage, I mean, I didn’t like the look of these things.
07:55
But if you’re asking how impacted systems actually respond, I found myself
08:01
more muddled than I expected to be.
08:03
So, part of my goal in talking about these larger issues, and I am going to get to
08:08
what the issues are, I haven’t forgotten what your question is; I am sort of
08:10
creating a context or setting for this.
08:12
My answer
08:15
is to try and communicate the flavor of something, and that we
08:20
don’t know these things we think we know as well as one might think.
08:29
But at the same time, we do know things, and so, it’s a fine line to
08:35
communicate both that, hey, there’s uncertainty there, there’s more complexity
08:39
there than you might have previously thought, but we still know something.
08:43
And the first part turns out to be, I think, easier to do than the second part.
08:48
The second part, which is to say what it is that we really know, what is it that
08:51
you can really bank on and can count on,
08:56
that those turn out to be in some ways more difficult, because in science
09:01
we’re trained to view, to sort of live with uncertainty and teach how we move
09:09
forward in the face of uncertainty, and to avoid the definitive and the absolute.
09:15
A lot of what we do is very relative, so
09:21
it becomes difficult to simultaneously communicate both of those things.
09:25
It is more uncertain than you may have thought, but we
09:28
really do know some things.
09:30
This translates into the arena in which I actually work; how
09:41
mountain forested watersheds work.
09:45
Which is not what most people view as a burning issue in and of itself, as I
09:52
can’t imagine many people in the public outside this field waking up and going,
09:57
“God, I wonder how and why mountain streams, look the way they do with all
10:02
these steps and pools and things?” That’s a question you only come to after you’ve
10:09
sort of dabbled in this stuff for a while.
10:11
On the other hand, I think the questions many people do wonder about is,
10:15
what are the influences and effects of human activity on watersheds in
10:24
various ecosystems?
10:26
The effects and issues, the things people pay attention to, have changed
10:32
dramatically over the tenure of my career.
10:47
When I first started to work on these
10:51
issues, there had been a history of questions like the following: What happens
10:57
if you cut this piece of hill slope?
10:59
What does it do to the stream?
11:01
Does it change the amount of water in the stream?
11:04
Does it change the amount of sediment in the stream?
11:05
Does it change the temperature of the stream?
11:07
Does it change the nutrient composition of the stream?
11:11
The early Andrews program, the watershed program, was set up to answer specifically
11:16
those questions, in as rigorous of a way as it was possible to do.
11:21
And the reasons why those were viewed as important questions, ranged
11:27
from issues around water quality.
11:29
People wanted to know if we cut our forests, are rivers
11:32
going to be perpetually muddy?
11:35
If you go back into the original
11:39
enabling legislation for the Forest Service, the issue of
11:45
human activity and relationships between trees and water, is
11:48
fundamental to the organic act.
11:51
The idea that the national forests were established to, “Maintain
11:55
favorable conditions of flow,” which congress left undefined,
12:04
it gives equal weight to providing a sustained-yield [logging] . And
12:09
one could view the history of forestry in this country as being
12:13
one in which we largely have
12:19
had a notion that forests were there, literally for conservation purposes.
12:27
So,
12:35
the issue of forests and water, the history of forests in this
12:40
country, has been one of Gifford Pinchot’s rational forestry with
12:46
a strong conservation flavor.
12:48
The forests were initially set aside to keep them out of the
12:51
hands of the timber factories.
12:55
But then over the latter part of the century [th] , we have gotten very
13:00
heavily into one of the purposes, which was a sustainable production of wood.
13:07
One could view more recent history as being in part, sort of the pendulum
13:14
swinging to the other side, as we begin to look at the other purposes
13:18
for which forests are maintained.
13:20
I think the public in general recognizes this, and certainly over
13:25
my career, issues other than timber have grown larger and larger until
13:33
now, they have a really loud voice.
13:36
The issues of the day are really the warp and woof and tension
13:40
between these different uses.
13:43
Congress, with its enabling legislation [U.S. Forest Service Organic Act] , may
13:46
not have initially seen those two uses as incompatible, but because
13:50
of the nature of population and just
13:55
time, they’ve become viewed as increasingly incompatible,
14:00
although there are ways of reconciling at least some of that.
14:06
My impression is that the issues, the issues over the course of
14:10
my career, the issues of what effect does cutting trees have,
14:21
not just on clean water, but the supply of water in general?
14:23
If you cut the trees, do you increase the propensity of rivers to flood?
14:30
Do you increase their propensity to run dry in the
14:37
summertime?
14:37
These are the issues that have been, they have really been with us forever,
14:40
but they were certainly the focal point of the early watershed program.
14:44
Then with time as the issues grew, we began to grapple with not just
14:52
the effects of this timber sale on this hillside on this creek, but the
14:58
fact that the landscape was now having to respond to multiple
15:04
sales and roads and other activities distributed across
15:09
a broad landscape, and that
15:14
the scale of the human modification of the landscape was growing, and
15:22
that we anticipated, we expected, or we conjectured, that there
15:27
may be a commensurably larger scale of the impacts as well.
15:31
So that is really where my career began, and
15:36
my dissertation research was specifically designed to address
15:41
the cumulative effects issue.
15:45
Which is a very ill-defined issue, when you think about it, and it’s a
15:48
particularly hard one for science to get its hands around, because it’s not
15:52
just the effect of A on B. It’s the effects of lots of A’s on A, B, C, D
15:57
and E, you know.
15:58
And when those effects are manifest over different time and space scales,
16:04
how do we put that all together?
16:06
That’s really what I got interested in early on.
16:09
The Andrews program was set up to deal, at least initially,
16:15
with this smaller-scale question.
16:18
And it’s only with time that we’ve been able to sort of expand the scope.
16:23
But at the same time,
16:26
the issues that motivated that expansion, have kind of gone along.
16:33
It’s sometimes hard to tell which is the cart and which is the dog,
16:35
that is, the early interest in the expansion of studies, from the effects
16:45
of cutting on timber sales or regeneration.
16:48
Sort of a pre-level or plot-level, scaled inquiry, to those broader
16:54
ecosystems, watershed or landscape scales, what we speak of as the
16:57
landscape scale, now the regional scale.
17:00
There has been this steady progression and expansion of scales and as
17:05
we’ve done this, and of course, the issues, have similarly changed.
17:10
We’re now talking about trying to manage and think about our effects on the fish.
17:16
Fish may be the biggest challenge of all, because it started with the owls.
17:21
The owls could, in a sense, could be viewed more as a plot, or,
17:28
as a natural extension of the plot- or patch-scale phenomenon.
17:34
The idea around the spotted owl was you needed big patches, big areas
17:39
[habitat] . But it was still that same notion of a range of territory that an
17:44
organism needs, and we can just extend it to fit our management schemes and
17:51
recognize there are organisms out there that if we keep nibbling away at the
17:55
place, they’re going to be squished out of their territory-habitat range.
18:00
Fish pose a completely different challenge, because
18:02
fish use the whole place.
18:04
They use the ocean, they use the estuaries, they use the big
18:06
rivers, they use the small rivers.
18:08
So suddenly, the scale at which you have to start thinking and doing science,
18:16
is much larger.
18:18
But at the same time, the sciences have been evolving, we now have satellites
18:21
that give us pictures of regions where we can actually interpret the environmental
18:26
changes over a region in the same way, which is somewhat commensurate
18:32
in scale to the way certain organisms, we believe, are using the landscape.
18:37
So, there is a kind of parallelism and it’s also,
18:43
the issues feed the science, and the science feeds the issues.
18:47
But getting way back to your first question, the really critical issues
18:53
are around this question of how we interpret the effect of human activities,
19:05
over the range of scales
19:09
at which those effects or impacts are manifest.
19:14
A lot of what we are trying to do, and a lot of the critical issue in
19:17
the communication with the public, this is coming full circle, is getting
19:21
people to think about the right scale, getting ourselves to think about
19:25
the right scale, and then trying to communicate what the right scale is.
19:29
Is it, for example, the right scale, if we are concerned about water quality?
19:34
One of the big issues is municipal water, the quality of water
19:37
being supplied to municipalities.
19:41
In the forests, some huge proportion, 70, 80, and in some cases, 90 percent, of
19:48
the total production of water that’s delivered to a city
19:52
like Eugene or Corvallis or Salem, comes from the forests.
19:56
One of the outputs of a forest is water.
20:02
And as cities grow and they push up against the forests, they’re
20:07
creating increased demand, and at the same time, the level of impacts
20:15
on the landscape are increasing.
20:16
What we want to know is, “What is the relationship there?” How do we think about
20:21
our own development and our own use of forests for other purposes, as it effects
20:25
this one very vital function of forests?
20:31
We are inevitably faced with the scale question, which is, if we
20:38
are faced with a creek that’s too muddy to drink, is it because we have one bad
20:45
actor up there, one bad timber sale with a slide that came down hit a creek and
20:50
muddied the place, because one slide can, can turn up a lot of mud, or is it the
20:56
pervasive, region-wide set of impacts?
21:01
Are all of these sort of small, bleeding sores, collectively and
21:04
cumulatively, creating an effect?
21:07
Because the strategy you employ to deal with that problem is very different.
21:12
So, this scale issue, being able to communicate this scale issue, and
21:17
being able to figure out the scale issue, is a critical piece of the
21:22
undertaking now, and I see the Andrews work as being one of the places, one
21:29
of the intellectual playgrounds, if you will, or proving grounds, where
21:36
some of these issues get tried.
21:37
A couple of questions or comments to follow up on that.
21:42
One, if
21:45
you could think about how and why your perception of the appropriate scale at
21:50
some point in your research shifted, and secondly, and this is probably
21:54
related, do you have any sense of how or whether the expectations of the
22:00
public, or by the public, of scientists and what science can do, has that
22:05
changed much in the last ten years, in
22:10
your experience?
22:10
You’re asking some real zingers.
22:12
Let me take the first one.
22:16
When I got into it, I thought I was biting off a big piece by jumping up
22:21
to this cumulative-effects question.
22:23
This was really an extension for me, and really, for the science.
22:28
Because again, the science, were all the little plot or small watershed scales, and
22:33
there were only a few examples in Redwood Creek in northern California, a couple
22:40
larger experimental basins where people were trying to ask about
22:44
the effect of cumulative impacts.
22:48
I felt I was moving up at that time, and for me personally, it’s been a struggle
22:58
and constant challenge, to figure out how to do science at these broader scales.
23:03
Because as soon as you get away from the plot, the thing you go out and actually
23:09
get your hands around and measure, and feel and walk and observe, suddenly
23:16
you’re in a whole other ball game.
23:20
It’s easy to feel outside one’s comfort zone on this, and I have felt outside
23:24
my comfort zone a lot, particularly as more and more questions began to
23:29
be raised about cumulative effects, and at this larger landscape scale.
23:34
Then you take it all the way up to the regional scale, and my god, how
23:37
do you do science at that scale?
23:39
So, the problem for me has always been reconciling where these questions are
23:45
being asked, and where you’ve got to be able to say something with the tools of
23:51
science and the standard precepts you get taught in school, the idea of being
23:59
able to reproduce an experiment, that where the modification itself is kind
24:06
of a grand experiment happening at the regional scale, with no replication?
24:10
I mean, it’s fundamentally alien to the way you think about science.
24:16
It so totally challenges your presumption of how to do it.
24:19
And I personally, have always felt myself to be a bit conservative with respect to
24:32
how eagerly we take on these larger scale issues.
24:37
On one hand, I recognize that
24:41
the scientific community in general, and I would add, the Andrews community in
24:48
particular, has a lot to say about these larger scale, regional-scale issues.
24:55
But what we have to say is very often informed speculation, rather than
25:02
something for which we have hard data.
25:07
It’s a projection, an estimation based on what we think, or
25:14
what we feel confident saying.
25:20
Does that get at your first question, which was, which was
25:22
how; remind me again what that was?
25:27
I was wondering if there were ways in which your understanding of the
25:31
appropriateness of scale, shifted over time, and I was also thinking
25:34
about things like major flood events.
25:38
Well, I worked on that from the get-go, so I’ve always appreciated
25:43
at some level, that larger scale.
25:46
I remember watching the flood of ‘96, and I had a couple of reactions to it.
25:54
It was a
26:01
fantastic event for me, and I know there was human misery and suffering attached
26:04
to this thing, but at the time it was happening, I realized I was watching
26:09
something I might never see again in my entire life, and how fortunate
26:15
I was to have witnessed this thing.
26:17
Here was this little creek that I had waded in and barely got my knees wet.
26:22
Now this thundering, broad-shouldered beast, was taking logs and
26:29
rolling boulders with impunity.
26:31
I was watching this and was utterly fascinated.
26:37
I couldn’t see enough of it.
26:40
Then, I remember thinking, what I am watching at right now is happening
26:45
up and down the spine of this entire region, and I was trying to get a feel
26:51
for that, and I couldn’t quite get it.
26:54
It was really not until we were driving from one place to another
26:58
in the forest, as we just happened to turn on the radio, at about
27:04
three or four o’clock on the day, when, really, all hell broke loose.
27:09
We began to hear, on the radio station in Eugene, and it was clear they
27:13
had turned all their programming over to dealing with the flood.
27:16
“We have got so-and-so with a horse stuck out in a middle of a field
27:20
that needs help, can someone please bring a trailer.” You know, “We have
27:23
people needing assistance over here.”
27:25
It was clear this thing was playing out at this grand scale, so here was
27:29
this thing that we here were up there, really seeing it, touching it, observing
27:36
it, and trying to take movies of it.
27:38
Suddenly, you are forced to think how this is playing out at this much broader scale.
27:45
But in terms of the intellectual and scientific basis for that, my
27:50
training really helped me think.
27:54
I think I’ve always recognized things like floods or fires, I mean,
27:59
you’re trained as a geologist and you think about how mountains and
28:04
plates move and long-time scales.
28:08
That’s fundamental to the training, so it’s not that my thinking about the
28:15
importance of scales that has evolved.
28:17
I think what I have more of is an appreciation that one can actually do
28:22
something that looks like science, even if it’s not perfectly the scientific
28:26
method, at these broader scales.
28:29
That’s what’s really changed.
28:30
I have more confidence than I did before that we can say something meaningful.
28:35
Again, I don’t think it’s the same thing that happens in a biochemistry lab,
28:42
where you have an experiment, that if you do this same experiment the same way,
28:46
you are going to get the same results.
28:48
It’s not like that, but you can apply scientific understanding and
28:53
test ideas at the landscape level.
28:56
The second part of your question is, “How’s the public perception changed?”
28:59
I think there’s always been latent reactions in the debate about how forests
29:06
ought to be used, the scale issue.
29:09
The issue of wilderness, for example, one I kind of cut my teeth on,
29:13
was fundamentally a scale issue.
29:15
Which is, if you got all this area that is cut over here, and here is the pie
29:22
of natural and public lands, and a huge chunk of it is in this category, and
29:31
very little of it is in this category.
29:33
Well, maybe we should be paying attention to that total bounds.
29:37
That’s in a sense what the wilderness issue was about.
29:40
People were motivated to say, “We ought to be making this slice of the pie bigger,
29:46
because once it gets into this other slice of the pie, it’s, it’s incontrovertible.
29:50
I mean, you can’t go back the other way.” So,
29:54
the scale issue has always been there, but I think there has been an increasing
29:59
sophistication of how we articulate it, and now, with the focus on organisms,
30:05
like fish, has expanded so that now we have a regional, a widely-accepted,
30:12
regional problem: the salmon.
30:16
Now, what I don’t think has happened yet, is that I don’t think this
30:23
idea of landscape complexity and dynamics has really introduced
30:29
itself into the public debate.
30:31
This is another addition to your question, “What are the critical issues, or what is
30:36
it that the Andrews group in particular has a role or has played a role in the
30:41
past in helping to advance?” I think one of the things that we’ve certainly
30:49
played with among ourselves, and I think perhaps have tried to communicate
30:56
with varying degrees of success to the public, is this idea
31:00
of landscapes as dynamic
31:05
entities.
31:05
Reflecting back to the flood, you may have seen this.
31:10
Have you seen the flood video?
31:12
No, actually.
31:12
You ought to.
31:13
I’ll give you a copy.
31:14
If
31:17
I don’t do it now,
31:21
I won’t remember.
31:21
Mark was telling me about it.
31:22
I haven’t seen it.
31:25
Have a copy.
31:28
It’s interesting, and there are some interesting issues that surface in that.
31:33
These
31:36
are from the Andrews mostly?
31:37
The Andrews and Siuslaw [National Forest]
31:37
. Okay.
31:38
And it [Landscapes of Change -- probable title is Torrents of Change]
31:38
includes some of the footage we took during the flood of ‘96, but on
31:45
the tape, I was asked, “How do I think about the landscape?”
31:54
And this just popped into my mind when the guy asked me the question.
31:57
This wasn’t a preprogrammed answer, although it now has a
31:59
certain program quality, because I’ve said it more than once.
32:04
But it relates to this issue of dynamic landscapes.
32:07
I was asked about the way I think about the landscape, one which goes through
32:13
decades of really not much happening.
32:17
Decades of boredom, and then something like a flood or fire
32:24
hits, and you’ve got hours of chaos.
32:27
And this concept, it’s funny too, because when I was thinking of decades
32:32
of boredom, I was also thinking about all the hours I’ve spent up in the
32:36
Andrews, sort of rattling around in the back of a van, or listening to somebody
32:40
talk about the forests, and feeling like I really wanted to go to sleep.
32:45
[Laughter] You know, it’s palpable sometimes, the place, but then
32:51
all of a sudden, boom, you get a flood, or, we haven’t had a fire
32:55
on the Andrews, but I can imagine.
32:57
If we got a big fire there, it would just blow us into a whole other orbit.
33:02
So, our own science, could be characterized as decades of boredom
33:08
punctuated by hours of chaos.
33:13
But the concept that is
33:21
the hardest for ourselves to grasp and communicate, is complexity, even though we
33:23
live it and deal with it, then communicate that to a wide audience in the public.
33:28
This is a really difficult challenge because people want to see things
33:38
in simplistic ways.
33:39
It’s either natural or it’s unnatural, it’s scared or it’s profane; it’s
33:47
pristine or it’s manipulated.
33:49
It’s that kind of thing.
33:50
Well, there are lots of times, probably when this landscape was not
33:58
an aesthetically- pleasing place, and yet it changed into something else.
34:06
The nature of that change, the processes that drive the change, and
34:11
the consequences of that change are things that I don’t think we have
34:16
really grappled with and understood.
34:19
If I can take a quick aside, you know, it’s like going to Europe.
34:23
You go to a place like Switzerland, and Switzerland is gorgeous.
34:27
It’s a mountain landscape, and there’s cute little chalets, you hear the “sound
34:33
of music” [reference to movie] from every hill, and it is a gorgeous place.
34:37
So aesthetically, it resonates with our human instincts, yet it’s absolutely
34:45
“unnatural.” I mean, it’s been walked on since the bronze age. The forests have
34:50
all been cut, were cut 2000 years ago. It’s all been converted to another kind of
34:57
existence, and yet it still retains some basic qualities and
35:02
quantities of what it had before.
35:05
And so, here in this country, we have not yet converted, we still
35:10
have remnant pieces, in some cases some pretty good chunks of remnant
35:14
pieces of what the place looked like before human beings really changed it.
35:20
And we have a very strong affinity and a feeling that, maybe we
35:23
ought to retain some of this.
35:27
And yet what we’re faced with is the fact that that in the broad scheme
35:34
of things, all of these landscapes changes and human beings are just
35:39
another agent of landscape change.
35:42
And I don’t think we have fully internalized that lesson, it’s almost
35:50
like going from Newtonian physics to Einsteinian, relativistic physics.
35:56
We still want to see things in the sort of simple-cause-and-effect model.
36:01
And yet what we are learning about landscapes, is there is no absolute state
36:06
that any of these places have to be in.
36:09
They are constantly evolving and changing and turning into other things,
36:13
and these things have consequences.
36:15
I mean, there are times in the historical record when salmon completely disappeared
36:20
from the Columbia River system.
36:21
But then they came back.
36:23
They disappeared for like hundreds, if not thousands of years, due to
36:28
big landslides or something else.
36:31
So these big disturbances happen, and they change the nature of the real estate,
36:35
they change who’s on the real estate.
36:39
And that’s, I think, one of the issues that we deal with and we are learning to
36:43
deal with, at the scale of the Andrews or
36:48
a small forest, but I don’t think that concept has really
36:52
entered the public debate yet.
36:56
I was thinking, one example of your effort to communicate was a good column you
37:01
had in the Oregonian shortly after the floods and the debate over the landslides.
37:06
Maybe you can talk about your concerns at that point in writing that article,
37:10
and what you specifically had in mind.
37:12
What motivated
37:16
that was
37:22
coming in, having this long history of discussion about the
37:27
effects of landslides, and not just landslides, but all effects of forest
37:34
management on processes like floods.
37:41
There’d been considerable debate about how human activities exacerbate floods?
37:49
If so, how much?
37:51
And for what processes?
37:53
And there was for me, and I think for Fred [Swanson] as
37:58
well, a sense there was a lot of
38:04
common wisdom
38:08
that was galvanized by the flood itself.
38:12
That is, people immediately went to what they thought they knew.
38:16
Which was,
38:20
thinking this thing’s got to be, you know, the Forest Service’s flood.
38:26
We all know that roads and clear cuts and so forth cause landslides, and there
38:34
were some early reports out where people had gotten up early on in an airplane
38:37
and flew around, thinking, “Oh yeah, there are a lot of landslides and a
38:40
lot of them started at roads and clear
38:44
cuts.” That just seemed to me, immediately, the spin-meisters on
38:50
that side were, you know, talking.
38:52
Then, on the other hand, there were people saying, “This is just such a huge
38:56
event, this doesn’t have anything to do with human beings; “It’s God’s flood.”
39:03
So again, we were getting into the simple, syllogistic debate,
39:07
“Is it God’s flood, or is it
39:12
man’s flood?” What motivated us to put that piece together, and I think we were
39:18
only marginally successful in retrospect, I think we didn’t do a good job
39:29
and think we just further muddied the water by introducing
39:38
this idea again of complexity, and trying to clarify what that means.
39:40
If you read that opinion piece, what we are really trying to say is,
39:45
“First, we don’t know for sure. It’s going to take some careful looking
39:50
to figure out who’s flood this is.
39:55
Second, we do know some things, and the things we know are based on a lot of
40:01
history and a lot of study by some pretty reputable people, and here’s what we think
40:06
some of those things are pointing to.
40:09
Third thing, before you start using this flood as an example of something to
40:16
motivate the current debate about what policy we ought to take, keep in mind
40:23
that the policy has shifted, but that this has not yet appeared on the landscape
40:28
yet.” There are lag times inherent in
40:34
this, and a momentum or inertia, landscape inertia, that by the time we
40:39
decide to do something, the system is already moving in a another direction,
40:45
and that is like turning an ocean liner around; you got to go a long way before
40:48
you can go in the other direction.
40:52
And there have
40:56
been some significant changes that have not really appeared on the landscape yet,
40:58
so be careful about how you interpret the results and effects of this flood
41:03
in light of these new practices.
41:05
Those were the motivating ideas behind that piece, so you can see where and what
41:10
it goes back to and what I started with, which is trying to add a little flavor,
41:15
saying, “It’s not as simple as you might want to believe out there.” But then,
41:19
it was interesting because it was then played off against another piece in the
41:22
same page, which was much more of a here’s
41:30
what we know piece.
41:31
Was there much response to that?
41:32
Not huge, but we got a couple of letters from people.
41:37
People were actually quite interested in the contrast between those two pieces,
41:44
and what
41:53
I discovered in lots of these things, is that these “public” opinions, and
42:02
I don’t know exactly what “the public” is, people hold their opinions in such a
42:07
way that even when new information pops up, that new information is typically
42:15
screened and filtered in such a way that those pieces of new information
42:23
that extract one’s deeply held views.
42:25
It’s true in science,
42:32
too.
42:35
You read a paper and you narrow in on that piece in that, that supports your biases.
42:42
It’s rare that you get somebody to react by saying: “You know, I used to
42:47
think of it this way, but because of what you said, I now think of it that
42:51
way.” So, most of the reaction we got was sort of like a “thank you” for
42:56
writing and confirming me in my bias.
42:59
[Chuckle]
42:59
That’s what I
43:03
would have expected, actually.
43:04
I’m curious.
43:06
You talked quite a bit here about scale and the way in which that
43:11
tends to create more problems and complexity for doing science.
43:16
I am curious about two things: One, how much of your work you do off the Andrews,
43:21
given that, as you were talking, where the scale of the Andrews is a limiting factor?
43:27
Secondly,
43:33
at what level does that work on and off the Andrews,
43:37
satisfy your concern about scientific rigor?
43:40
In other words, how do you balance the concern about scale and
43:44
fuzziness of science versus, as you pointed out, your conservative
43:48
tendency towards scientific rigor?
43:51
How do you feel about
43:55
that?
43:55
Boy, I would love to get a list of these questions, because a lot of them are
44:00
the sort to meditate over for some time.
44:05
This one sort of occurred to me as you were talking.
44:07
No, you’re right on and are picking up on some very interesting,
44:12
and for me, unexplored areas.
44:16
That’s what I am intrigued by, but it is a very useful to think about,
44:25
first, the facts.
44:26
The facts are, the Andrews work probably represents, maybe 25
44:34
to 35 percent, of my total effort.
44:38
But
44:41
that changes with time and projects.
44:44
After the flood, for example, a lot of what I was doing and thinking was
44:48
Andrews-based, because here we had this rich store of previous data, we
44:53
had had the big event, it fell right in my domain, and I was realizing
45:00
this is something we can really mine.
45:03
Then, as we got into it, we realized, the Andrews, even for this flood,
45:07
is only one piece, and there are other places we should go to try
45:11
and put the Andrews in context.
45:13
So, we went and took on places formally outside the Andrews, but which displayed
45:19
phenomenon we were interested in, like other streams that either did or did
45:23
not experience large flood change.
45:26
And then, I have been recently doing a lot of work in the Coast Range.
45:32
Most of it started in trying to understand and develop ways of
45:39
thinking about the Coast Range in
45:43
its “regionalness,” rather than going out and studying one
45:46
creek or one bunch of creeks.
45:51
Then, I’ve also got a lot of my work,
45:58
while some pieces were done either at the Andrews or in its environs,
46:03
it tries to get at things that are not linked to any one place.
46:07
Ultimately, we would like work at the Andrews to be something that says
46:12
something about fundamental processes, rather than processes at the Andrews.
46:17
So,
46:23
there’s a warp and a woof as far as how engaged and involved I am.
46:28
It’s also hard to say, to really add it all up, because a lot of my students,
46:32
or people I advise, are doing work at the Andrews, which I kind of consider in
46:40
this fuzzy umbrella of issues on which I have some interest in and activity.
46:48
The second part of your question was, what’s, why don’t you repeat it
46:52
back to me, as it had to do with the how I reconcile the larger scale.
46:59
Yeah, you’re concerned with
47:02
the problem of doing larger scale research and the tendency for
47:06
that to become more difficult to replicate, and your traditional
47:10
standard in scientific research.
47:12
I was wondering what strategies you have evolved to try and deal with that?
47:16
Well, it’s very much a work in progress.
47:19
One
47:22
idea and one thought,
47:25
is that I’ve kind of backed into uses of models and modeling,
47:34
taking advantage of some of the technology, which has
47:38
really just been amazing.
47:42
I’m sure you’ve been getting this from other people, too.
47:45
The proliferation of technology, in many ways, science is led by technological
47:51
advances, just like everyone else.
47:54
The fact that we can do remote sensing, the fact that we can do GIS analysis,
48:00
has kind of an imperative attached to it: You can, therefore, you must.
48:04
I
48:06
resisted some of that, I mean, I know how to make a computer work, but
48:12
I’ve drawn the line at learning GIS.
48:14
Not because I can’t do it, but because I don’t want that, I
48:21
don’t want to get good at it.
48:22
Because then I suspect everything, every question, I have would start
48:27
looking at a question I could only answer with the GIS system.
48:29
I don’t know if that is true or not, it may just be laziness,
48:35
but I’ve certainly found myself thinking along those lines, and this
48:40
modeling is along these same lines.
48:42
That is, the
48:45
models, for example,
48:49
tell me the climate, how much it rains and where, and give me a landscape,
48:55
and I’ll tell you how much water is in the creek over, not just how much, but
48:58
the time-trend of water in the creek.
49:00
That’s a hydrologic model and I’ve played some with those.
49:04
These are things that you really do over big landscapes.
49:08
You know, you can predict what the flow in a Lookout Creek or
49:11
McKenzie River is going to be.
49:14
In the work in the Coast Range, we’ve begun trying to link these
49:18
hydrologic models with landslide and debris-flow models, ultimately
49:23
linking them to channel models.
49:24
So, you can sort of build these games where you take models in their own
49:28
right, and then link them together to create larger models or models of models.
49:35
All this is very compelling and fascinating, in part,
49:38
because what it does, is it gives you numbers to play with.
49:42
You create something and then you run it, and it gives you what
49:46
looks like data coming out of it.
49:49
It looks like but it’s not, it’s kind of a fun house, where what you’re
49:55
getting reflected back at you is, in many respects, what you put into it.
49:59
That’s what I’ve learned, what I’ve been trying to learn, as to how to deal with
50:03
these larger issues, which is that the models give you is a way of generating
50:09
hypotheses at this larger scale.
50:13
They give you a basis for saying, “If what I think is true as encoded
50:19
in this model, the model becomes the encoding of what I think is true,
50:24
then the system ought to look like
50:28
this.” That then provides something you can go out
50:32
and look for. And suddenly, I’ve become more comfortable
50:38
with using that as the basis for operating at these grander scales.
50:43
The problem has always been you can’t really generate,
50:45
it’s very hard to generate hypotheses, in these large scales.
50:49
What you can do and what you end up doing, is describing here
50:52
is what the pattern looks like.
50:53
There is a lot of work right now in pattern description which
50:59
is absolutely vital to science.
51:04
You’ve got to start with the taxonomy before you start talking about evolution.
51:09
You have to know why a bug is different from a lion.
51:12
But
51:15
for myself, I find the intellectual challenge to be bound up in saying, “Why
51:23
does the pattern look the way it does, and how would I know why the pattern
51:27
looks the way it does? How can I test that?’ I mean, that sort of instinct of
51:34
wanting, and I think this is true for all people who are trying to describe pattern.
51:38
They are doing it for a reason; it’s not just for pattern description.
51:43
But I really want to jump ahead to that point, you know, I want to
51:48
find some patterns that have already been described, and then understand
51:53
why, why are they the way they are.
51:56
And
51:59
so that’s been the way I’ve tried to reconcile this larger set of scale
52:04
issues which is, can we use another way to frame the question, such as,
52:09
“What are those ways of describing patterns that are really useful in
52:16
terms of testing models of how a pattern got there?” There’s an infinite
52:19
number of descriptions of pattern.
52:22
We could run a sensor over the Coast Range and
52:32
ask, “What is the distribution of gases coming off this landscape, or what
52:43
is the distribution of water vapor coming off this landscape?
52:45
Now, that may be very important to try and understand the way the land interacts
52:50
with the climate or something like that.
52:51
But for other things, it may not be that important.
52:53
It may just be a description, and description employs within
52:59
it that you have an idea about how you are going to use it.
53:04
And so, that’s part of what I’ve been focusing on in my own work; “What
53:13
are the really useful descriptions of patterns out there, and what are the
53:18
scales at which those, that we make those pattern descriptions, and then,
53:21
how do we use that to actually say something about how it got that way?”
53:27
Good entry into a question I was going to ask later, but this
53:29
might be a good place to focus.
53:30
Talking about the use of ideas and descriptives in relation to this
53:35
hypothesis testing, maybe you could talk a little bit about your understanding
53:41
of the sort of differences and concerns between what people might call
53:45
applied research and basic science?
53:49
What is your take on that?
53:54
Let me jump ahead beyond what I would predict to be the most common, I mean
53:59
there are easy answers to that; “Well, it’s a continuum, and obviously one
54:04
informs the other.” Let’s take that as a given, and go to the next step and
54:10
ask, “What really are the differences?” I think there really are differences,
54:17
and
54:22
if you had asked me that question five years ago, I would
54:25
have probably stayed with the
54:30
simple answer.
54:33
I feel that I’ve been fortunate
54:39
to have stumbled upon something which is a basic scientific discovery.
54:45
Basic.
54:49
I’ve only done this once in my career.
54:53
It has such a novel feel to it that I realized it’s a gift from the
54:57
gods, and that if you only do it once in your career, you’re very lucky.
55:05
It feels really different than everything else I’ve done.
55:11
It was an insight into what I think is a fundamental property of nature.
55:20
I don’t want this to sound bigger than it is, but it was for me
55:25
personally, a very big experience.
55:28
And it’s funny too, because it’s an experience, that despite the fact I work
55:33
in a scientific enterprise, is one that I have a very difficult time sharing with my
55:39
colleagues, because it feels so different than most of what I do, and most of
55:47
what everyone does.
55:47
And I constantly struggle here to try and separate my own ego from this.
55:52
I feel it’s a gift.
55:53
I don’t feel it’s something, I feel that I was fortunate because
55:57
of my own experience to be in a place where I could see something.
56:01
But that’s what it was, I mean I just saw it, something that nobody
56:06
has seen before, or at least has not seen in quite that way.
56:10
When I graduated and got my Ph.D., my father gave me a little thing here, by
56:19
the guy who discovered Vitamin C, Albert St. Georgie, who researches to see
56:26
what everyone else has not seen, and to think what no one else has thought.
56:30
I got this from my father, and “Thanks dad,” that’s really a nice thing and
56:37
thank you for sharing that, and I put it up on my wall. But I didn’t really
56:42
understand it until I had this experience.
56:45
I did not realize that there really are times when you can think about
56:51
things in ways that everyone else has thought about them, and suddenly you
56:53
see something no one else has seen.
56:57
So, that is what I consider basic research.
56:59
I mean, that is the fundamental research experience.
57:03
And to have that insight, and then try to go and show it, to
57:06
test it against some real data.
57:08
That
57:11
feels different at a fundamental level than most of what I do, which
57:18
I think of it as much more applied.
57:21
I want to describe the channel in a way that I can distinguish
57:25
between logged and unlogged systems.
57:27
I want to build a model that allows me to test whether the changing pattern
57:34
of vegetation has had an influence on the character of debris flows and
57:39
consequences for stream channels.
57:40
I want to examine the effects of this dam on sediment transport and
57:46
channel morphology of the lower river.
57:49
All those questions, they are wonderful questions, and
57:51
intellectually engaging questions.
57:53
They have many ramifications, you can extract very useful insights
57:59
into how nature works from any one of those things, but it feels different.
58:04
That’s the distinction in my mind.
58:07
I don’t know if that comes through or not, but there’s something about the process
58:13
of looking, of trying, and you can’t even do it by trying, that’s the thing,
58:23
as I can’t make myself have an insight.
58:26
You can think about something, you can sort of prepare yourself for it, you
58:30
can constantly be challenging your own interpretations and experiences, and there
58:34
are sort of things you can do to create a seed bed, but you can’t make it happen.
58:40
I don't expect it will ever happen again.
58:42
I mean I really don’t.
58:43
If it does, it’s a miracle, because it, the feeling, the other thing
58:49
about it, is the insight, which I’m happy to explain to you, feels to me
58:59
to be deeply embedded
59:02
in what it means to do science.
59:05
Unlike anything else.
59:06
What I mean by that, is you can prove it right or wrong.
59:12
And I also know that if I’m dead wrong on this thing, that is, if I
59:16
completely am off on the wrong course
59:19
-- -- it
59:29
doesn’t matter, and that too, is a marvelous experience.
59:34
What it means, I don’t really care.
59:38
If I am asked, I say I don’t really care if I am right or I’m wrong, because
59:44
either way, it makes a contribution.
59:46
Now, the thing fascinating about this, is that I think this is the greatest thing
59:50
since sliced-bread, and I’ve sort of thrown this out there, published on it,
59:56
and have been met with deafening silence.
59:59
So, the road, if you look at history of science, it is full of
1:00:03
crack pots, and some people think
1:00:07
the moon is made of Swiss cheese.
1:00:08
But
1:00:13
the worst part, is thinking, what I really want is for someone to take
1:00:17
this thing on, and prove it up or down.
1:00:23
The worst thing is silence, then it’s like, excuse me!
1:00:29
But, that’s part of the game, too.
1:00:31
Part of the game is either that this thing is so trivial, which I don’t
1:00:34
think it is, so trivial that everyone knows it, and alright, what’s the big
1:00:39
deal about it, or else it’s out there on a limb where the stuff in-between
1:00:45
hasn’t quite developed to the point.
1:00:47
Or, it’s just dead wrong of what everyone thinks of it, maybe it’s not
1:00:51
so trivial, but maybe so off-base, no one wants to spend time on it.
1:00:57
I haven’t quite sorted that out yet.
1:01:00
What I really think is that I would love to do is spend some time on this idea,
1:01:05
like a year on the reality, the linkage, while there is linkage there between the
1:01:13
specific problems of how up the river and so forth, the linkage is miles away.
1:01:19
You have to develop this so that it’s a tool, or so that it solves somebody
1:01:24
else’s problem in a very direct way.
1:01:27
It’s going to take some integration and it’s going to take more than I can do.
1:01:32
It’s a bigger job.
1:01:34
So part of your problem is resources and funding?
1:01:36
And just recognizing that this might be important.
1:01:40
You see, in the context in which I work, it’s not very important.
1:01:43
That’s the irony of it, is that in the management-driven world,
1:01:49
and getting back to your question, what does applied research mean?
1:01:53
Well, applied is you got some basic, you got some maybe very basic, but
1:01:59
you got some specific problem in mind
1:02:04
that you really want to have solved.
1:02:06
For example, what is the effect of A on B,
1:02:11
even if they’re very broadly characterized?
1:02:13
What is the effect of cutting trees on streamflow and water quality?
1:02:16
That’s a very big topic, a career’s worth of work right there,
1:02:22
but that’s where I draw that distinction, because it may not
1:02:27
be appropriate to call having a scientific insight as being the only
1:02:32
thing that constitutes basic research.
1:02:35
But, it’s the one thing in my professional experience that has
1:02:41
such a different feel to it that I want to call it something else.
1:02:46
And I think the applied universe in which I spend most of my time, 90
1:02:52
percent of it, I’d say, is one in which the nature of the work is much more.
1:03:00
In some respects, it’s basic in that we are trying to understand, how do
1:03:05
mountain streams respond to floods?
1:03:08
That’s a basic kind of question, but it’s not very far to jump to ask,
1:03:15
“What effect does human activities have on it, and how might we predict
1:03:19
the effects in such a way to mitigate consequences of floods on whatever?
1:03:26
And we, all of us, use that very short linkage there, even if our focal point
1:03:32
is just really to understand floods.
1:03:35
We’re very quick to grab the human dimension of the problem, the specific,
1:03:40
here’s what we are going to do, we’re going to solve this problem for you.
1:03:42
And the environment we live in, we’re very eager to go that way, mostly.
1:03:51
I mean, part of what I love about my job is I get to do things
1:03:55
which I think are relevant to a larger set of societal issues.
1:04:00
But, it’s been an interesting experience to try and reconcile this
1:04:05
thing that feels like it has very
1:04:11
deeply,
1:04:17
a kind of “science spirituality” quality, and you feel like, “Wow I get it, I
1:04:23
really see it, I get what St. Georgie is
1:04:29
talking about!” And I don’t want to call it more mundane, because the quality
1:04:34
of the problem requires just as much intellectual effort, just as much blood
1:04:39
sweat and tears to pull off, but there is something different about them.
1:04:45
It’s probably a gross oversimplification of what you’re saying, but just to get
1:04:48
it straight, because I want to talk about first what the insight was, and then,
1:04:51
what the publication was, it sounds like a good example, but my oversimplification
1:04:55
is that you just said that basic science is something that you don’t really care
1:05:02
if it matters to anyone else or not, and applied research is something where
1:05:06
one of your concerns is that other people are going to care about this.
1:05:10
Well there’s something, there’s some truth to that.
1:05:13
It has to do with the level of work and where one cares, the locus of caring.
1:05:18
Do
1:05:20
I care whether people read about the basic thing?
1:05:24
As I was saying, the silence is the worst part of it.
1:05:27
I do care about that.
1:05:29
Not to the point that I am going to make a big deal of it.
1:05:33
For me, it was absolutely essential that I publish this.
1:05:37
I mean, it was like a gnawing feeling in my gut until I got this thing out.
1:05:43
I had to get it out.
1:05:45
And it was an interesting process there, too, because I shot it at nature and
1:05:51
science, and said this is tough and almost got into it, you know, very
1:05:56
hard to break into that kind of thing.
1:06:00
And particularly with an idea that is not really well-developed, not
1:06:04
fully-developed, which it wasn’t.
1:06:07
So, it’s not just, in one case I care and in the other case I don’t.
1:06:10
It’s more that
1:06:14
I think it has more to do with that
1:06:18
I think that
1:06:21
true basic science,
1:06:25
to be put out there in a way, that whether it’s right or whether it’s wrong,
1:06:37
it represents a contribution to two things: One, is it’s
1:06:44
put out there in a way that can be shown to be right or wrong.
1:06:48
Most of what we do cannot be shown to be right or wrong.
1:06:52
I mean you can’t, most people won’t replicate it, and
1:06:54
even if they do, you can’t.
1:06:56
And most of tests of it are not clear cut.
1:07:04
It’s interesting, because at about the same time I put this paper out,
1:07:11
I put another paper out co-authored with Julia Jones, which had to do
1:07:17
with the effects of clear-cutting and road construction on peak flows.
1:07:21
This hit the street two months after the flood in February ‘96.
1:07:27
And the reaction to that paper has been 180 degrees.
1:07:32
There has been storm and fury around that paper unlike
1:07:37
anything I have ever experienced.
1:07:39
So, this discussion about what’s the difference, is really,
1:07:45
specifically looking at the effects of human activities on a natural system
1:07:55
using very long-term data and some sophisticated statistical techniques,
1:08:01
and we came up with things that
1:08:07
could be viewed, in many cases, as either, A, a dramatic new insight,
1:08:16
or B, corroboration of something everyone already knew anyways, or C, either
1:08:26
absolutely wrong or really sloppy science.
1:08:31
The reactions to that have been all over the board, especially in the newspaper,
1:08:35
which promoted two different groups to come back and write papers in their own
1:08:41
right, specifically directed at this one.
1:08:44
The timber industry hired a statistician for six months to
1:08:50
completely reproduce our analysis.
1:08:52
So, there’s reproducibility in the sense of they literally took
1:08:55
our data and redid it using their own approaches and techniques.
1:08:59
What was the journal that came out with it?
1:09:00
Both of them came out in the same journal, Water Resources Research.
1:09:04
I’m happy to provide you
1:09:10
with them.
1:09:10
Yeah, if you have reprints that’d be great.
1:09:14
So that for me, contrasts how these two things had played out, and now
1:09:21
one of the distinctions is truly, that is the difference between
1:09:26
these, well, it is the difference.
1:09:29
People care about this and they don’t care about that,
1:09:31
when you come right down to it.
1:09:33
That’s what it is.
1:09:34
And
1:09:37
so, maybe the difference has to do, just not so much with whether you
1:09:43
care, but whether the work is done in a way that someone else cares.
1:09:46
I’ve never put it quite that way but it’s an interesting distinction, it’s
1:09:52
a potentially important distinction.
1:09:57
It’s an interesting one, because it’s a different way of addressing
1:09:59
it than most people I’ve asked that question of have come up with.
1:10:03
Maybe you could take this example and talk about it, because I
1:10:07
think you’re on to something here.
1:10:09
First of all, where were you when the insight struck, was this on the Andrews or
1:10:15
--? Sitting on the beach.
1:10:17
On the beach?
1:10:19
On the beach
1:10:21
Hmm.
1:10:21
It shows you how
1:10:24
odd things happen.
1:10:25
The insight hit me on the beach.
1:10:30
I was on the beach with my family, and I had always been fascinated by these
1:10:39
little channels that flow over the beach.
1:10:42
These little tiny channels your kids love and throw sticks in
1:10:46
them, and so here’s a picture of
1:10:51
one.
1:10:53
I’ve always loved them, because they’ve always been the kind of river
1:10:57
you could, get your hands and your feet around, you could walk in them
1:11:03
and watch them, and the insight was
1:11:12
a recognition that every one of these channels that I had ever
1:11:16
encountered in Oregon, which has some specific properties of the nature
1:11:20
of the beach, was doing something,
1:11:26
they were all doing it.
1:11:29
And the fact
1:11:34
that these channels that were flowing over the beach, were kind of
1:11:39
ultimate channels, in a certain way.
1:11:43
By ultimate channels, I mean is they were channels that could
1:11:47
do anything that they wanted to
1:11:54
do.
1:11:55
They are high energy streams because the coastline in
1:11:58
Oregon is a high-energy coast.
1:12:00
The slope of the beach actually comes from the wave, the ocean wave.
1:12:06
And they, because they are high energy waves, they impose a fair
1:12:09
gradient on the beach front.
1:12:12
These old streams come down off the headlands and they hit this beach front,
1:12:17
and they have a high energy with the slope which is kind of imposed upon them
1:12:24
by the wave, it’s a given, in a sense.
1:12:28
At the same time, they have, what they are falling over is sand, and at the slope
1:12:35
that the streams flow over the beach, they can move all the sand they want.
1:12:41
In other words, they’re at that kind of capacity.
1:12:45
They are not limited, as most streams are, by the amount of energy they
1:12:49
have relative to the amount of the stuff they are flowing through.
1:12:52
If we go out to that stream at that flow, you can see the steps.
1:12:58
Nothing is moving, the flow and the bed of the channel are not in
1:13:02
any kind of equilibrium, or that equilibrium point is way out there.
1:13:06
It is only during floods that that thing picks up and moves around.
1:13:10
But here is a stream that is totally in a dynamic kind of setting,
1:13:15
because it has all the energy it
1:13:18
needs, the sand is perfect, because it is completely homogenous.
1:13:21
It is nothing else but sand, and then I realized that the
1:13:25
fact that all these streams were doing the same thing was telling
1:13:31
us something.
1:13:32
But the insight went beyond that, because what I realized was that
1:13:35
the process by which these streams were changing, and they were.
1:13:40
If you watch these streams, what you see is these little waves building and
1:13:47
then breaking, and then, the stream goes back to being kind of flat.
1:13:51
Have you seen this?
1:13:53
You can if you watch these things.
1:13:55
I realized that where I had seen essentially that same process
1:14:02
when I had been working in Japan, on why these boulder bed streams
1:14:08
form these kinds of steps.
1:14:09
And that the concepts of mechanisms of step-pool nature that I had
1:14:16
developed in the mountain streams was
1:14:21
actually identical to the mechanism that these sand-beds create.
1:14:26
So suddenly, I realized I had an idea that spanned, everything from
1:14:30
a sand-bed stream to a boulder-bed stream, and everything in-between.
1:14:37
So, what happened for me was a combination of being fascinated by these little dinky
1:14:42
streams, experience working in these big boulder-bed streams, and then just having
1:14:48
this idea because I was interested in how these things form, and then seeing that
1:14:54
same mechanism happening in the sand bed.
1:14:56
Realizing these were ultimate streams, they could do anything they wanted,
1:14:59
realizing that this is a fundamental tendency of all streams that are steep
1:15:03
enough and energetic enough to display it; that’s what this paper is about.
1:15:07
In a sense, your scale thing, where you took things off this locale, where you
1:15:12
apply it to, almost the global scale?
1:15:15
It turns out it might even work on Mars.
1:15:18
Seriously, I’ve been in communication with the guy who’s the head of
1:15:22
the Martian Pathfinder enterprise.
1:15:25
It turns out it may even work there.
1:15:26
They are finding these same channels?
1:15:26
They are finding sub-channels, and if you start doing flow
1:15:31
reconstruction; we are going to be talking in December about that.
1:15:34
I was glued to my television set when this stuff came out.
1:15:38
But you see how different that is with anything that has to do with forestry,
1:15:41
a whole other scale of enterprise, because it represents something that
1:15:46
isn’t proved, if it’s a stream, whether forested, mountain, sand bed, or whatever.
1:15:52
It is cross-cutting, so in a nutshell, that’s
1:16:00
what I came up with.
1:16:02
Getting back to
1:16:05
what you were mentioning earlier about group things.
1:16:07
This would be an example where a group thing becomes part
1:16:11
of an individual insight.
1:16:12
I mean, you were basically involved in this effort to expand
1:16:16
the concept of scale in your individual work, and with the LTER.
1:16:22
You go on this individual trip to Japan, come back to the Oregon
1:16:25
beach, and here’s an individual insight that comes out of that.
1:16:28
That’s right.
1:16:29
That’s exactly right.
1:16:33
And something you just said made me think of something that I hadn’t
1:16:39
really thought of before, which is that it is the experience of thinking
1:16:45
across scales, and thinking about how does what I’m seeing here, how
1:16:49
might that apply to the larger scale.
1:16:54
On one level, that’s something intrinsic, as I said, to the
1:16:57
geologic or geomorphic training.
1:16:59
You know, you get taught that.
1:17:00
On the other hand, the experience of doing that is something that I think I
1:17:05
got from the Andrews group, and I think I have never properly credited that,
1:17:08
and so I appreciate what you just said.
1:17:10
I think that’s true.
1:17:15
Maybe you could talk a little bit about who from OSU
1:17:26
and the Andrews, would you identify as your closest colleagues or associates,
1:17:29
over the last, say five years?
1:17:38
Probably two.
1:17:41
Can I give you two?
1:17:43
Dave Montgomery.
1:17:47
Where is he?
1:17:47
He is at the University of Washington,
1:17:51
and Tom Lisle.
1:17:52
Tom Lisle?
1:17:55
Lisle.
1:17:55
L-I-S-L-E.
1:17:58
At the Arcata [California] Forest Service lab.
1:17:59
Are
1:18:01
they hydrologists?
1:18:10
Geomorphologists.
1:18:13
And
1:18:17
a third would be a friend from graduate school who has really been my
1:18:20
closest friend/colleague, although we haven’t ever written a paper together.
1:18:31
And that would be Rob Jacobson with the U.S. Geological Survey.
1:18:38
Also a
1:18:42
geomorphologist?
1:18:43
Yeah.
1:18:45
Did you want to add more?
1:18:46
No.
1:18:46
That’s it.
1:18:47
One of the reasons I’m
1:18:50
asking this is to try and get a concept of how the group was interconnected with
1:18:55
other programs.
1:18:59
When
1:19:02
you think about your experiences, graduate school, particular universities,
1:19:08
John Hopkins, University of Oregon, and Oregon State University, how would
1:19:12
you characterize opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange and cooperation
1:19:17
here as compared with elsewhere?
1:19:19
It’s interesting that your closest colleagues away from
1:19:22
here are all geomorphologists.
1:19:30
Well, Hopkins was
1:19:36
distinguished
1:19:40
by its interdisciplinary
1:19:44
program.
1:19:44
In one department you have a guy who was on Reagan’s council of economic advisors,
1:19:50
sharing a hallway with a guy who developed Marxist geography as a discipline.
1:19:59
They hated each other, but shared the same hallway.
1:20:05
It was a department in which you had people who were studying
1:20:08
geomorphology as I was, who were doing sanitary engineering, who
1:20:13
were doing systems analysis.
1:20:15
It was a department of geography and environmental engineering.
1:20:19
So, if you can imagine “sludge” and people who were studying plants and
1:20:24
where do you put your pipeline to Alaska, and why are the inner-city folks
1:20:30
of Baltimore being displaced by urban renewal, all under one roof, you have
1:20:38
a concept of what the place was like.
1:20:41
The theme that most commonly brought people together was water.
1:20:47
So, there was a kind of organization that was thematic, but the real
1:20:51
theme, what really brought people together, was the fact that we had
1:20:54
a chairman, Wolman, who was eclectic in his thinking and interests, and
1:21:01
who was trans-disciplinary in his outlook.
1:21:04
He embodied thinking about everything about everything.
1:21:10
Suddenly, everything had value.
1:21:13
I got that in my graduate education.
1:21:16
I actually got my undergraduate degree through doing an
1:21:19
interdisciplinary thing about rivers.
1:21:22
When I came here, it wasn’t that different from my own experience,
1:21:29
so I felt very comfortable.
1:21:32
What I felt was comfortable, for it was in fact
1:21:37
the lack of a strong complement of people who did what I did.
1:21:44
I felt that more, and I’ve continued to in some ways feel that more than I have
1:21:50
felt the interdisciplinary business.
1:21:51
And it may be my own failings in that I have not abandoned myself to
1:22:00
the true interdisciplinary exercise.
1:22:03
I believe there are people in our group [HJA] , Fred
1:22:07
obviously jumps to mind, who have themselves
1:22:14
sort of abandoned the
1:22:18
notion that they represent a discipline.
1:22:24
They are really forging their own set of links and their own boundaries,
1:22:27
sort of emerging boundaries themselves.
1:22:29
I don’t
1:22:33
think that is what I am doing.
1:22:35
I think I am more again, conservative, in a sense that I feel that
1:22:42
there’s value in having a strong disciplinary base to operate
1:22:52
from, and to bring that into a group setting.
1:22:57
And so it’s true, when I look around, when I need nourishment and
1:23:03
sustenance, what I do is interact with colleagues in my discipline, because
1:23:12
I really don’t have many around here
1:23:17
to interact with.
1:23:18
In doing so, I really come back in touch with many things that I
1:23:23
have a harder time articulating.
1:23:24
This business is foreign, I mean these are people for the most part,
1:23:29
I work with every day of my life.
1:23:32
But, while I’ve talked about it, the implications and the ability to sort
1:23:37
of critically examine it and interact with it, with me over it, and call me
1:23:42
wrong, is not inherent in what we do.
1:23:45
It’s not part of this place.
1:23:47
So,
1:23:54
I have a different take on this interdisciplinary thing, which is, I
1:23:59
clearly have chosen to work within it.
1:24:02
I get great value from it in the sense that I feel it has really pushed me out of
1:24:10
what would otherwise be a very narrow or much more narrow, disciplinary tendency.
1:24:17
I feel that it has really enlarged my world, and that now I can think
1:24:20
about implications and consequences in a broader realm than I used to.
1:24:26
On the other hand, I also see it as a challenge to sort of
1:24:34
be faithful to one’s roots.
1:24:37
It’s particularly critical, when you think about training students.
1:24:41
Because, I now see students being trained as if interdisciplinary-ism
1:24:48
was the answer, or something.
1:24:51
I think it’s an open-ended question as to how you train students
1:24:56
to operate in that environment.
1:24:58
Do you do it by submerging them in it and teaching them about it?
1:25:01
There are some people who I think believe it.
1:25:04
I’m not sure I do.
1:25:05
I have found too much of my professional consequence
1:25:15
comes from
1:25:18
feeling like I really bring something to the table that others don’t have.
1:25:23
It’s not “turfism,” but it’s a sense that there are a set of tools
1:25:28
here, or a set of perspectives, that are very useful to this broader
1:25:31
enterprise, and I think what happens.
1:25:35
I am getting on a soap box here, but my concern in terms of training, is
1:25:39
that unless you train people to have that kind of base, a confidence that
1:25:45
they can return to draw nourishment from kind of a tap root or spring,
1:25:52
you’re always in sort of a fuzziness that becomes much more a standard practice.
1:26:01
I happen to believe that these disciplines, particularly the ones that
1:26:04
have been around for a while, there is a certain set of ideas, there’s an
1:26:09
identity, an intellectual identity that one can have, that one can bring, and
1:26:15
that is in and of itself, and valuable.
1:26:18
So, I am afraid that I got afield.
1:26:22
That’s good.
1:26:28
You’re raising some good points.
1:26:29
I want to ask you about the issue of recruiting assistants, because you
1:26:34
were talking about graduate students and the concern for instilling
1:26:37
in them some base for knowledge.
1:26:38
Maybe you could talk about your philosophy or strategy of identifying
1:26:44
and recruiting qualified assistants, what kind of graduate students
1:26:49
– Do I look for?
1:26:50
Yeah.
1:26:50
What kind of qualities do you look for?
1:26:52
Boy, that is a good question and it’s one that’s very much a work in progress.
1:26:57
I don’t feel I’ve gotten that one down.
1:27:03
My history has been that,
1:27:07
five, six, seven years ago, I decided that I wanted to have graduate students, that
1:27:13
I wanted to make room in my life to be training students, in that kind of more
1:27:19
intimate way than one does in a classroom.
1:27:23
And
1:27:27
initially, I was kind of
1:27:32
an
1:27:34
opportunist.
1:27:34
People would come over and knock on my door, and say, “Well, I’m over here in
1:27:38
the geography department, but I’m not really getting what I need or want, and
1:27:42
I’m interested in what you’re doing.
1:27:43
Can I work with you?” And I would say, “Sure, here’s something you might
1:27:48
work on or have you considered.” That
1:27:56
really became more formalized after a while, in the sense that I was now getting
1:28:03
applications of students and I would start sort of looking at them more critically.
1:28:10
But what I was looking for, I didn’t have any clear picture of what I was
1:28:16
looking for, other than the usual, “I want somebody who can do everything
1:28:22
and, you know, comes in with a stellar record and you hit the ground running.”
1:28:30
I’ve come to admit that I
1:28:34
am lousy at predicting who’s going to be good and who’s not.
1:28:45
And at the same time my search image has changed, based in part on my experience,
1:28:50
which has been almost 95 percent good.
1:28:57
But, part of what I’ve learned, is that having students and training them is a
1:29:05
big commitment and investment of my time, and my intellectual capital, and [chuckle]
1:29:12
both of which are in short supply.
1:29:21
The other thing I’ve learned is
1:29:25
personality counts, and
1:29:29
I’m telling you most of my experiences have been great, good to great, so
1:29:35
I don’t have this long history of either myself getting burned out on
1:29:40
the students or them getting burned out on me, in any particular way.
1:29:43
But, I know some configurations work better than others.
1:29:48
There are some people, for example, the way I train students is the way
1:29:53
that I myself was trained, which was a very strongly laissez-faire attitude.
1:29:59
Students,
1:30:03
the way it worked with Wolman was, you took a number, you got 20 minutes with
1:30:07
“the pope,” he described, he basically just threw out a bunch of stuff at you,
1:30:13
and left you to your own devices to figure out what was important and what wasn’t.
1:30:17
And it was all important, and you had to figure it out, and
1:30:24
I don't pretend that I am anywhere near as insightful, on target as he was.
1:30:31
I know I’m not, but I still do the same thing, which is students come in,
1:30:36
I say, sit right down, ask what they are doing, and I go off in a zillion
1:30:41
different directions, and at the end of their 30 minutes, I try to give them a
1:30:46
little more time than he gave me, but basically the same idea, and they go off.
1:30:51
And I’m sure about half of them leave here more confused than when they came in.
1:30:56
There are some students who take that confusion as a challenge, then work
1:31:01
on it and do something with it, and there are other students who just
1:31:05
go, “I’m confused and I’m pissed,
1:31:08
because this guy is supposed to help me and he is confusing me.” So, part
1:31:12
of what I’ve learned to do is to try and select students who fit my style.
1:31:21
So for me, the ideal student is someone who is stellar with a proven track record,
1:31:25
comes in, instant rapport, requires nothing more than a sentence or two, and
1:31:32
is launched. I mean, that’s the ideal.
1:31:34
It hasn’t happened yet, but my concept is really that.
1:31:41
Beyond that, I think that I look for students who are able, who are
1:31:45
self-starters, who are able to navigate what really are uncharted waters in terms
1:31:52
of extracting an education from a place as diverse as OSU, where there isn’t
1:31:57
at least in my area, a well-trod path.
1:32:00
More students have trod it, but there are some real potholes in that path,
1:32:06
and there’s not a strong institutional commitment to geomorphology as
1:32:12
evidenced by faculty, full-time faculty.
1:32:14
I’ve essentially, Fred [Swanson] and I, sort of, and Julia [Jones] , have been
1:32:18
filling the holes in what is otherwise
1:32:26
not supported strongly by any one department here.
1:32:30
I’m not a university professor, I don’t whistle, I don’t
1:32:34
dance to, to university tunes.
1:32:36
I’m probably lousy at helping a student navigate the real requirements
1:32:41
for serving the university.
1:32:44
I know that, and most of the problems I’ve encountered with students have
1:32:47
been that I’ve had them go off, I see them as doing a research program where
1:32:53
it takes a couple years to get your head into the idea of doing research.
1:32:57
By that time, university says we want you out of here.
1:32:59
So, there’s those kind of issues, they’re institutional problems
1:33:03
that make it hard to function,
1:33:09
in the past, even the recent past, I’ve sort of blithely
1:33:15
sort of said, well I’m a Forest Service employee, but I really
1:33:17
act like a university professor.
1:33:19
Well, I don’t really.
1:33:21
I have to be careful about that and I’ve been little bit too glib.
1:33:31
As a Forest Service employee, you have the option of dealing only with Forest
1:33:35
Service technicians and post-docs for filling positions, but you’ve made this
1:33:41
decision to go towards grad students.
1:33:42
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the relative merits and problems you’ve
1:33:45
encountered with that very option here.
1:33:48
It’s really a choice.
1:33:50
I mean, the choice of going with students, is motivated by several factors.
1:33:57
First, I enjoy the interaction with students directly.
1:34:01
Doesn’t mean that I don’t enjoy the interaction with Forest Service
1:34:04
technicians also, but I enjoy having these bright minds, and it helps me
1:34:13
because they keep me on my toes, and
1:34:17
the nature of the discussion is always very, very stimulating.
1:34:20
But
1:34:23
the other thing is that the way the economics work,
1:34:29
there is some equation of time and money.
1:34:32
And basically, if you go the Forest Service route, at least this is the
1:34:36
way I’ve thought about it, it costs more money, but takes less time.
1:34:41
To go the student route, it costs less money but takes more time.
1:34:50
That’s an over simplification, but in some respects it’s true.
1:34:54
A lot of what I do, a lot of my research, is funded in a very
1:34:59
cobbled-together kind of way.
1:35:02
Not the model that I get this big chunk of money, and then I get to sort of
1:35:06
rationally decide how I invested it.
1:35:09
And there’s a little bit over here and a little bit over there, and then
1:35:11
this thing comes up and I got to go.
1:35:13
How am I going to spend ten thousand dollars?
1:35:14
Well, I’ll get a student, you know.
1:35:18
It’s that kind of stuff, so, some it is just driven by that, the nature of
1:35:27
that sort of institutional setting.
1:35:32
The other thing is that I find in many respects, the university is easier
1:35:38
to deal with, institutionally and bureaucratically, easier for me to
1:35:43
stick money in a co-op agreement on the university side, and then have
1:35:47
students work on projects out of that, than it is to try and push through
1:35:50
a position with the Forest Service.
1:35:51
Now, I have to be honest that I haven’t really tried.
1:35:54
Other people have been successful at it, so I suspect that it is doable too, but
1:36:00
in large measure, I find that for many of the things I need, I find the university
1:36:07
much more responsive and able to accommodate the somewhat chaotic nature of
1:36:16
the work scene more than the Forest Service.
1:36:18
So, I tend to use
1:36:20
it more, I think, for that reason.
1:36:24
Some good issues came up here, leading us towards a conclusion here.
1:36:28
Lead on.
1:36:30
One of the concerns that I have been trying to grapple with here, is what
1:36:35
kinds of issues people find important to bring before LTER meetings, and how
1:36:40
that relates to leadership decisions and the decision-making process
1:36:47
of the group.
1:36:47
These kinds of things; getting funding to hire assistants, what kind of programs get
1:36:52
priority funding and to which area of this cobble stone structure of the LTER group.
1:36:58
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your perception of how the
1:37:01
decision-making process evolved over the last ten years or so.
1:37:18
The way I think about it is that,
1:37:25
the different scales at which decisions get made, there is the scale of
1:37:31
allocation of resources in which
1:37:35
they are allocated.
1:37:38
And that tends to be a process that is driven strongly by the
1:37:45
grant writing and funding process.
1:37:47
That is when we, the science enterprise, LTER, in my view, gets its clearest
1:37:56
focus around writing grants to justify projects and obtain funding.
1:38:03
I suspect this is not uncommon.
1:38:07
But from a science enterprise standpoint, I think never are we more together or
1:38:13
apart, because it has both elements of it, than when we have to sit down and
1:38:19
justify our existence to each other.
1:38:23
As a part of that, the decisions, the large-scale decisions, about
1:38:28
how resources, and particularly new resources, get allocated,
1:38:32
tends to be made at that time.
1:38:34
As we put budgets together, we define alliances, we define who is
1:38:41
doing what, and what their responsibilities are.
1:38:45
In the past, there has not been much revisiting of those decisions.
1:38:51
So, those decisions, in my view, typically get made at about 5-year
1:38:57
intervals, and then you get launched on a trajectory that involves multiple years.
1:39:05
And
1:39:09
I don’t think we have been very good, maybe I shouldn’t put it quite that
1:39:15
way, but I think it’s true, doing the business of seeing how we are doing.
1:39:23
Here’s what we said we were going to do.
1:39:24
Here’s who we said was going to do it.
1:39:26
Here’s how far we expected to be at this point.
1:39:29
Where are we?
1:39:30
And then making course corrections accordingly.
1:39:34
That can be viewed as a kind of rational model of how one ought to proceed.
1:39:40
I don’t think it works that way around here.
1:39:43
My view is that we tend to
1:39:48
make these decisions by establishing what the order of feeding is
1:39:56
going to be, the sequence of
1:40:00
tasks.
1:40:01
Generally, never is there a lot of discretionary money floating around
1:40:07
in this outfit, so basically what we do with the grants is we establish who
1:40:12
will be in the long-term, who will we support, because there are people whose
1:40:17
entire existence is bound up in that.
1:40:19
So the way the budgeting works, is we take care of those people first, the people
1:40:24
we’ve decided we want to keep around.
1:40:26
And then, we have a little bit left over to play with, and the playing gets doled
1:40:31
out amongst a lot of players so that no one person ends up with more than,
1:40:36
very much of anything, if anything.
1:40:39
I mean, there are people who play without any research funding.
1:40:41
Most of my work with LTER has not been funded directly by the LTER grant.
1:40:46
Now, there’s another piece of that, which is that the LTER funds a
1:40:50
whole bunch of ancillary activities.
1:40:52
For example, the field crew that goes out and collects all this data, their salaries
1:40:58
aren’t covered for the most part by LTER, but covered by the Forest Service.
1:41:03
But that whole enterprise feeds data directly into the
1:41:06
enterprise I then make use of.
1:41:06
So
1:41:09
literally, there is a whole data, QSG shop and all the computer systems, and
1:41:15
there is an LTER contribution there, so
1:41:20
we are just talking about resources there.
1:41:23
That’s one way to look at the way the power and decisions get made.
1:41:27
It’s basically ad-hoc, with the exception that there are these clear
1:41:32
funding priorities that we all agree on, typically without much discussion,
1:41:37
and that tends to be arrived at, more or less by consensus, and then,
1:41:41
there’s a sort of pot-splitting-up that is built around specific tasks
1:41:45
and rough lists, and the rough scaling of how much things are going to cost,
1:41:49
and what we expect to get done by it.
1:41:52
There is some follow through on that, but typically, not a whole lot.
1:41:58
So that is one enterprise, the other thing is the budgetary loop, the resource
1:42:04
allocations and so forth, and the set of issues that just keep coming up.
1:42:12
Some of these come out of the discussions we have, the science-based discussions,
1:42:21
some of them come because of external circumstance, like we have a flood, and
1:42:26
then things fall apart during the flood and we got to put them back together
1:42:30
again, how do we put them back together?
1:42:32
You got money, more money than we need to just put it back the way it was, so how
1:42:36
do we change it to make something better.
1:42:37
What
1:42:40
are some long-range goals for long range measurement?
1:42:45
Facilities like the climate station.
1:42:47
We expanded the climate station over the last five years.
1:42:52
How was that decision made?
1:42:53
Well, a climate group met and put forward proposals and put a budget together,
1:42:58
and managed get external support.
1:43:06
And we are kind of told to do that by the group as a whole, and
1:43:10
there was also a blast at the end.
1:43:12
So, again operating sort of on a consensus level, there was generally
1:43:19
enough credibility with people, and members of the group held in
1:43:26
high esteem stand up and says we really need to do this thing,
1:43:29
there often is not a lot of debate.
1:43:32
It tends to be more, well so and so thinks we ought to do, I guess we ought to do it.
1:43:37
There is a lot of that that I think goes on, to the Andrews’ credit, and,
1:43:45
basically, it’s a group that functions well at that level.
1:43:51
I think there’s some places were the group doesn’t function as
1:43:55
well, specifically because of that.
1:43:57
We don’t deal with conflict very well, and don’t have a lot of
1:44:00
experience dealing with conflict well.
1:44:02
We tend to suppress it, and so some of that even comes out as suppressing
1:44:10
debate, in other words, we have a tradition of not having contentious
1:44:18
forums for debating these things.
1:44:21
It’s much more that people of different domains, identified and accepted
1:44:26
domains of activity, in which they make decisions that the group as a whole
1:44:31
operates to kind of bless decisions that often get made at a finer scale.
1:44:38
And there isn’t a lot of
1:44:42
real challenging that goes on, except every so often something happens,
1:44:48
and then, you really are faced with the fact that, not only might you
1:44:51
not agree about everything, but you really don’t have a lot of history in
1:44:54
disagreement, so it has a different feel.
1:44:59
It’s like two people who never fight, suddenly having a fight.
1:45:02
Suddenly, whoa, what’s going on here?
1:45:04
As opposed to two people who’re always sort of having discourse.
1:45:07
You know, then the weighting looks different.
1:45:09
I’m getting a feel here, I think it has to do with not so much with how the
1:45:14
decisions get made, but with the process of the group is for dealing with it.
1:45:20
How has the group dealt with that kind of conflict then?
1:45:23
Lacking that experience and background, what’s the outcome
1:45:27
when that kind of thing does occur?
1:45:28
There is a lot of one-on-one talking that goes on.
1:45:34
The group as a whole tends not to deal with it.
1:45:39
It tends to fall to a few people in leadership positions to reconcile and
1:45:48
work it out, often in ways that are not clear, not transparent to the group.
1:45:55
But that’s where the grapevine and the other webs and back-channel
1:46:02
ways that people communicate among themselves kicks in.
1:46:06
So, that’s where people like Art and Fred would make the decisions?
1:46:09
That would be a perfect example.
1:46:12
Then, I don’t know how much you know, but this is an issue that
1:46:19
has gone on a long time.
1:46:19
You are talking about Art and Fred in leadership roles?
1:46:23
Yeah, that’s
1:46:29
right.
1:46:30
But there are other issues.
1:46:32
I mean, it’s a bunch of people, and people have issues and problems with each other,
1:46:37
and different styles of doing things.
1:46:40
So that would work in
1:46:46
different situations, but typically, issues tend to be
1:46:51
isolated, and what happens,
1:46:56
my impression, is people who don’t feel that those issues were fairly dealt with
1:47:01
in the resolution of those issues, they typically just disappear from the group.
1:47:06
They dropout.
1:47:08
Now again,
1:47:15
I don’t have another model for this, there are lots of other
1:47:19
models, but I’m not arguing that there should be another model.
1:47:21
I’m just looking at what happens, and again, this is my perception of it.
1:47:27
But it is an interesting dynamic, because I think it’s a little bit
1:47:33
like the dynamic that goes on, if I may globalize a bit, it’s like the
1:47:38
way in a pluralistic society, there is a real premium on getting along.
1:47:47
And we’re in a pluralistic, an interdisciplinary, pluralistic society.
1:47:52
There’s a real premium on getting along.
1:47:56
In large measure, because in most cases, there is only one fish
1:48:01
biologist or one geomorphologist.
1:48:05
From a purely professional level, I don’t understand what a fish biologist does.
1:48:10
I don’t know what is important.
1:48:11
I count on him to tell me what is important.
1:48:14
So it’s interesting, and again, I’m maybe getting a little far field, but I
1:48:20
think that the way our [Andrews group] ecosystem works is that there are niches
1:48:23
that people fill, and it’s probably very difficult to be another person,
1:48:33
like another geomorphologist wanting to break in to this group where there is
1:48:40
already somebody occupying that niche.
1:48:43
So, in that sense,
1:48:46
I haven’t gone all the way with this.
1:48:48
One of the problems, I think with training, is that we want really
1:48:53
good people to come in, but you have to open, you have to make
1:48:57
room for them in some way, and that room has to include intellectual
1:49:00
room, has to include disciplinary room, has to include social room.
1:49:06
I think the way we have tended to operate is that we have a limited
1:49:09
number of people, and they each have a portfolio, and then we count on
1:49:15
everybody to represent that portfolio.
1:49:17
Typically, there is a certain amount of,
1:49:26
we don’t talk about how do we make sure what’s happening within that
1:49:29
portfolio is really first-rate stuff?
1:49:32
We leave it to the people within to do that themselves.
1:49:36
How do we make sure that there is the next generation that’s emerging
1:49:39
within each of those portfolios, assuming we want the same group, the
1:49:42
same set of issues, to be represented?
1:49:44
I think, instead, we accept that we are going to evolve in some other
1:49:48
direction, people will come in, and in many cases they come in, identifying
1:49:52
and then occupying uninhabited niches,
1:49:58
using an ecosystem model.
1:49:59
I think that, I haven’t put it all together like that,
1:50:02
but I think that’s true.
1:50:03
Like we got into remote sensing, because suddenly there wasn’t anybody
1:50:07
doing that, and somebody shows up and says, “What a coincidence, you
1:50:09
know, I can do this.” Hey, great.
1:50:11
So, if any sort of a peer evaluation goes on or takes place in the group,
1:50:15
it sounds like with your geomorphology work, how people outside the group view
1:50:19
it, is kind of your gauge of excellence?
1:50:21
Right.
1:50:22
Exactly.
1:50:22
Entirely.
1:50:24
Entirely.
1:50:26
Some people have talked before about how, say someone comes in and isn’t meeting
1:50:31
somehow the standards of the group, the common way of dealing with that, is
1:50:35
that person simply doesn’t get funded.
1:50:38
The way you were just describing this, if I was following you right, is that those
1:50:41
funding decisions are group efforts, in the grant-writing process and decisions of
1:50:49
where is this money going to be allocated.
1:50:52
So, from
1:50:55
what you’ve been just saying here, it’s sounds to me, and correct me if I’m
1:50:58
wrong, it sounds to me like there’s this political component too, that gets to be
1:51:02
some kind of group acceptance to maintain that level of funding, and that it could
1:51:06
be, as likely to be a community-based decision as it would be, say
1:51:12
science-based or peer-evaluation based?
1:51:15
Well that’s an interesting question.
1:51:17
I don’t know if we have ever been really challenged on that, because
1:51:20
what the challenge would be is if we had someone who was doing first-rate
1:51:23
science and didn’t get along.
1:51:26
I don’t think that has ever happened.
1:51:28
I think,
1:51:32
and my suspicion, would be based on the way the group tends to function,
1:51:39
is that if there is somebody doing first- rate science that nobody
1:51:42
could get along with, they would
1:51:46
not automatically be pushed out of the group.
1:51:50
In fact, quite the opposite.
1:51:51
It would be more likely that you would, the way the group is more
1:51:56
inclined to work, is somebody not doing first-rate science, who everyone
1:51:59
likes, would be continued ad infinitum.
1:52:07
I have nobody in mind when I’m saying it, but that would be more
1:52:10
in keeping with the tendency of this group, because of the common culture.
1:52:14
Several other people have made the same observations.
1:52:15
Yeah, that you
1:52:18
would, because there is such a strong imperative for getting along.
1:52:23
Because there is no one else who speaks your language, or you could
1:52:26
convince yourself that you don’t really speak somebody else’s language.
1:52:29
That nobody is really held accountable, I mean the accountability is
1:52:32
really the big issue, a big issue.
1:52:35
And I look at my own actions.
1:52:37
I’m not sure I’ve been accountable for things I’ve gotten from the group.
1:52:42
And there have been, but we have no mechanism really for even holding
1:52:46
people accountable, and I don’t really think anyone really wants
1:52:50
a mechanism like that, to be honest.
1:52:50
Keep the informal structure, is what they’re saying?
1:52:51
Yeah, it’s all informal.
1:52:53
Now as I say, most of the time that works very well.
1:52:57
And I think it’s the success of the group that we’ve been able to survive without
1:53:03
a lot of formal structure around it.
1:53:06
It has worked remarkably well for having been so informal, and at the
1:53:10
same time, allowing different leaders to emerge, who are real leaders
1:53:14
and really do have those abilities.
1:53:17
I think this system would break down if there wasn’t at least one person
1:53:22
who could play a leadership role.
1:53:24
If that happened, the structure could easily fall apart, because
1:53:32
we don’t have a strong set of internal mechanisms and
1:53:36
processes for resolving conflict.
1:53:39
It’s mostly been done, because we identify somebody will be a leader, and
1:53:43
they will resolve it if it shows up.
1:53:45
That’s what I think happens.
1:53:47
If we lose a leader, it just puts us in certain kind of vulnerability
1:53:53
because the ability to resolve and endure is not necessarily
1:53:57
the way we would go in a group.
1:54:00
The turning point would be if you have an identified leader who does it, but
1:54:05
people don’t think of them as a leader.
1:54:07
If somebody were to advance into that role, and no one could agree that
1:54:12
they were in fact the leader, I think,
1:54:16
that it is probably the key vulnerability of our group.
1:54:22
It’s an interesting point, because as you were talking about that, it
1:54:24
dawned on me that I’ve never asked this question of anybody, and that is
1:54:28
really simply, how leaders are selected?
1:54:32
I know that with Jerry [Franklin] , he just kind of evolved into the
1:54:35
group, and then, I know that there was a transition from Jerry to
1:54:38
Fred [Swanson] . Jerry essentially identified Fred as the likely successor.
1:54:44
But I was wondering if there was any process of ratification by the group
1:54:47
of that decision, or how did it go?
1:54:55
There may have been, but I was not part of it.
1:54:59
I want to make sure you understand who you’re talking to here, in
1:55:04
that I don’t consider myself to be
1:55:08
strongly embedded in the power structure.
1:55:12
I consider myself a player, but I’ve not been in the room when a lot of decisions
1:55:18
got made, either by personal choice or
1:55:24
schedule.
1:55:24
Most of it’s been by personal choice, and I always have the sense that if I
1:55:27
wanted to play more of a role there, I could, because my program is in research.
1:55:35
But I go off in a lot of different directions, not all of which are
1:55:38
the Andrews, and I feel myself intensively mortgaged for time, and
1:55:46
recognize some of the limitations.
1:55:47
I’m just telling you that so that you understand that that you’re getting a
1:55:50
limited view of the way things work.
1:55:56
But my impression is that it’s done on a very ad-hoc basis, and that Fred
1:56:02
just, “naturally stepped forward.”
1:56:11
For Fred, one of the things that made that easy was that he had a
1:56:12
longstanding tradition with the group, has a personality style in
1:56:17
which he doesn’t create a lot of
1:56:21
enemies, so there wasn’t an invested constituency, an anti-Fred
1:56:25
constituency, at any point.
1:56:26
He has been very, very effective at that.
1:56:29
And the third thing was, he had a different enough style from Jerry,
1:56:34
that the people who were sort of burned out, there were some ways
1:56:37
that Jerry managed things that Fred did differently, so that in a sense
1:56:46
made it easy for everybody to coalesce around his leadership.
1:56:51
In my view, he has been very effective in that role, and
1:56:58
finally, he’s one of the few people I know who can actually hold in
1:57:03
his mind what everyone is doing.
1:57:04
He probably is the only guy in the whole operation who really
1:57:10
understands, at least to a first approximation, what everyone is up to.
1:57:14
The organization needs at least one of those.
1:57:17
That requires
1:57:19
someone truly interdisciplinary in their own thinking, because you
1:57:22
have to be able to not go into a discussion with somebody thinking, my
1:57:27
discipline is the most important and everything else is sort of a support.
1:57:32
Fred generally doesn’t do that.
1:57:33
If he’s talking to someone who’s doing plant ecology, or GIS,
1:57:40
microbial maps, or something like that, he can understand and think about it
1:57:43
at the level at which they’re thinking about it, rather than his own view.
1:57:46
So, in this constellation of a group, that’s a very, very important glue,
1:57:51
because that way, you have at least one person who sort of does what
1:57:55
Wolman did in the department in which
1:58:02
I was training.
1:58:03
Probably what I would have to say, the most important ingredient
1:58:07
for a successful LTER operation is to have least one of those.
1:58:14
I’ve talked with Fred about this, and Art [McKee] also, but it’s useful to get
1:58:19
the insight from someone who’s, as you say, not at the heart of the whole issue.
1:58:24
I was curious if you had any perceptions of how the mechanics of the transfer of
1:58:31
leadership roles worked.
1:58:35
Does it involve something as simple as taking leadership
1:58:38
in the LTER discussions or-.
1:58:40
Oath of office.
1:58:41
[Chuckle] I
1:58:46
think, it grew out of, um you know those times.
