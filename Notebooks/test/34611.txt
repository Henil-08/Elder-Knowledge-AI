00:35
This is most of the current stuff this year, and what’s up ahead of me for next
00:41
year and some of the projects I’m working on now, just to tell you about them.
00:46
Yeah, some people also find C.V.’s [curriculum vitas] helpful.
00:49
It’s being updated.
00:50
I didn’t have it available for you right now because we’re including
00:54
the publications and ones in print.
01:06
Yeah.
01:06
Oh God, I shouldn’t say that.
01:07
[Laughing] Well, they said if they keep them general, stuff
01:11
slips through the cracks.
01:12
Sure.
01:16
Well,
01:18
what do you need?
01:19
I looked over your sheet here and I’m in a position to give you a quick
01:24
rundown, and the rest you can get off the C.V. It seems to me it makes sense.
01:30
Okay.
01:30
I had some questions I was going to ask you, but do you have
01:33
something you want to start with?
01:35
I thought I would give you a thumbnail sketch of how I got to be here.
01:39
That was my first question.
01:42
My understanding was that you started here in 1955 on the faculty.
01:47
Please just talk a little bit about your personal origins
01:49
before you came to that point?
01:53
I grew up in Chicago, started at Iowa State University, went into the army for
01:59
a couple of years in the 40’s, and then came back and finished my bachelor’s at
02:04
Iowa State in entomology and zoology.
02:07
I then went to University of Kansas for an M.S. in entomology,
02:12
and then, kept going west to the University of California-Berkeley,
02:21
and that’s where I got my Ph.D.
02:22
Okay.
02:22
I came up here [OSU] in 1955, and joined the faculty in the Department
02:33
of Entomology.
02:34
I worked my way up through the student ranks, and I taught most of
02:39
the time.
02:40
The original department was a joint department with
02:41
the Department of Forestry.
02:41
I worked on
02:47
some agricultural crops and insects, and then became full-time in science,
02:52
except for a couple of years, or a term.
02:54
I stayed in science.
02:58
That was most important.
03:00
Principally, I was responsible for the development of the entomology
03:03
laboratory, which we still have.
03:05
It was many years until we got that going.
03:09
Also, about 2 1/2 years instructing, a little more than that.
03:13
But, I always liked teaching and taught a lot of courses over the years,
03:18
especially systematic entomology.
03:20
My original work was in aquatic entomology, and then, we got
03:24
someone full-time to do aquatics, so I sort of bowed out of that.
03:28
But, I headed up the Science Honor’s Program first, before
03:31
there was any other honors program.
03:33
Then, we developed a giant one with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
03:35
It was in ‘65 or
03:38
’66, when I set up the University Honors Program, and it’s still going.
03:43
There was a short hiatus a few years ago, when we dropped
03:46
it, but they reinstated it.
03:50
Then I spent two sabbaticals in the Netherlands, one in ‘65-’66, and one in
04:05
‘73-’74; at Utrecht, which is very much like Oregon State, an applied school, and
04:11
that’s where we were this last 6 weeks.
04:13
Went back after 20 some odd years.
04:13
Didn’t know whether we
04:18
should or not, but it was very nice.
04:20
You kept close contact after you left?
04:22
Well, the fellow I worked with, unfortunately, died of a brain tumor.
04:25
One of his publications is right here.
04:29
The
04:33
first time there, I got to read the whole thing.
04:35
He wrote it in English, as many Dutch typically do.
04:40
It was to be volume one of three for his thesis.
04:45
Having had an awful lot of students bemoan over their theses, I convinced
04:50
him that one volume was probably quite adequate for a thesis, so there it is.
04:55
The other one disappeared.
04:57
I got that one back.
04:58
The second time I got to help, doing the second volume, not for a thesis anymore.
05:04
I’ve loaned it to my students many times, and it never came the last time.
05:10
He didn’t live long enough to finish
05:15
the third volume.
05:15
The third one was going to be on
05:20
internal structure.
05:21
That would have been a wonderful book.
05:24
He wasn’t there, unfortunately, this last visit.
05:28
While I still have a few other friends there, the department’s
05:31
gotten a lot smaller.
05:32
Because the new chairmen narrowed that scope of what they can do there,
05:39
several people left.
05:41
Several retired early, because it was pretty clear that they didn’t have
05:47
much of a future there.
05:48
That’s sort of unfortunate, but just as I was leaving, they were getting ready to
05:51
have a gathering to reconsider the goals
06:12
of the department.
06:13
You were saying you were chair here?
06:16
When I got back, I
06:20
became [OSU] Assistant Dean of Science, for six years, and
06:25
was still teaching entomology.
06:27
While doing that, I set up the core biology course and the core biology
06:34
program, which is the basis for most biological experiments done here.
06:40
Then I went on another sabbatical,
06:46
and then came back, and was the acting chairman of entomology for a
06:53
couple of years, and also the chair of the [OSU] Biology Department, and
06:56
created a new biology program, while they were looking for a new chairman.
07:00
There was one that we had for one year, but he left.
07:01
So I stayed for a couple of
07:06
years.
07:06
Then I went over as Associate Dean of Science for five years.
07:12
Was that in the 80’s?
07:12
Exactly when I don’t know.
07:14
The termination of that was ‘87.
07:16
The reason I know, is because I went on sabbatical again.
07:19
So, that seemed like a good way to make the transition.
07:22
I had the opportunity to go over full time, but still
07:27
teach and have grad students.
07:34
I figured the thing that kept my sanity over the many years in and out of all
07:38
the various things was entomology, so I decided to come back to the department.
07:42
And, I went on sabbatical to Oxford for five months.
07:45
That was ‘87?
07:47
Yes, ‘87.
07:47
It was five years, so I suppose that’d be 1982.
07:48
For the stretch, ‘82 to ’87, I was Associate Dean of Science.
07:55
There, I did all kinds of things.
07:57
I was responsible for summer term and a lot of fiscal things, and
08:03
was a general liaison between the dean and various departments.
08:10
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your professional research
08:13
interests, starting with when you were an undergraduate, through
08:18
until about the time you came here.
08:20
Well, I was interested in beetles.
08:22
When I was
08:25
an undergraduate at Iowa State, they sort of tolerated my interest in beetles.
08:26
But they, not
08:34
very subtly, probably not subtly at
08:38
all, redirected my interests.
08:51
Then I went from there to the University of Kansas, and I spent a
08:56
year getting my masters there with a man by the name of Hummerford.
08:59
What was the name?
09:00
H.B. Hummerford.
09:01
He was one of the leading entomologists of the day.
09:04
There weren’t that many in those days.
09:07
These folks were all really senior scientists, so I was very fortunate
09:12
that I did my thesis with them.
09:14
Then I went to Berkeley and worked with Dr. Robert Ussinger, another
09:20
really distinguished professor, so I’ve had a really fortunate background.
09:24
And I guess it was too late to become a beetle specialist after all that.
09:29
I found that there was a great deal to touch in my interest in the bugs, and
09:33
I still have worked on them ever since.
09:35
Oh, I’ve broadened my horizons quite a bit and I’ve tried to think when I
09:41
was reading this, and, as I mentioned to you before, I didn’t see much
09:44
mention of Oregon State in here at all.
09:47
It’s interesting to have started off at
09:50
Iowa State, which is a school very
10:01
much like Oregon State
10:04
– an agricultural university.
10:07
Kansas was a real university, and at the time I made that transition,
10:11
I found, at that time at least, a very sharp distinction between
10:15
a state college and a university.
10:16
University of Kansas was a really first-rate university, and quite
10:21
a different emphasis I’d say.
10:23
How would you explain the difference?
10:24
Well, the emphasis was more on the basic side of things.
10:28
Not surprisingly, in contrast with the University of Iowa,
10:31
Iowa State was responsible for
10:34
all the applied programs.
10:36
Yeah.
10:36
More recently it started doing some other things.
10:36
But they had a long and
10:50
very distinguished history of entomology.
10:52
They had some really fine scientists there.
10:55
So,
10:57
I wouldn’t want to say “guilt by association,” but by being associated
11:00
with them all through that time, the first
11:04
couple terms before I became 18 and entered the Army, and then afterwards,
11:07
I got to know all of them very well. It was just a “dream” entomology/zoology
11:14
department.
11:14
There were the graduate students.
11:18
They sort of ignored the fact that I was an undergraduate and I was just included
11:22
in the group, probably because I was older I suppose, but it didn’t seem to matter.
11:28
That was one thing I really found peculiar, and to this day, I’ve
11:34
never been able to explain it.
11:36
When I got to the University of Kansas, they
11:42
were discussing a book on evolution, and I suddenly realized, in four years at
11:49
Iowa State, we’d never talked about it.
11:52
And I found that very, very unusual.
11:56
And I remember getting in a discussion with one of my friends about chapters
12:00
in this book, and I was all right, but I really didn’t know a heck
12:03
of a lot about what I was saying.
12:04
I said the words all right, but I didn’t understand them then.
12:08
It surprised me that a department with so much entomology, and I took other zoology
12:12
courses as well, there really hadn’t been anything said about the scientific term
12:17
“evolution,” which puzzles me to this day.
12:20
The man I worked with had a huge library, which you can tell.
12:24
I inherited his books along with some other folks I’ve worked with.
12:32
He had all
12:35
Darwin’s books, and talked about them as historical pieces, but
12:39
little about what was involved.
12:41
So, when I taught that course [evolution] , I taught a course here years ago, we had
12:45
a moment when we had slightly different
12:49
takes on evolution.
12:49
That accentuated what I thought was perhaps the difference
12:53
between a college and
13:04
a university.
13:06
Then I got
13:13
to Berkeley, and the new
13:17
chairman of Kansas had just come from Berkeley.
13:22
I worked with the chairman for many years, and stepped down and he took
13:26
over, so it wasn’t hard to make that transition to Berkeley where
13:31
we were doing a great deal of that.
13:32
But by that time, I had many questions and I had to take my own courses, since
13:37
there was virtually nothing left on it.
13:40
They just made it very clear that you’re going to be responsible for it,
13:43
so you’d better be prepared to answer
13:46
questions.
13:46
But we just didn’t take any courses [on evolution]
13:47
. But at that point, you were already on the faculty?
13:49
No.
13:50
I went to Berkeley first, and then came up from there, just out of the thesis.
13:55
It
13:59
was clearly a transition into contemporary biology, with
14:12
ecological and evolutionary angles.
14:13
The fellow I worked with, Ussinger, was
14:20
an
14:23
extraordinary person.
14:24
He had students worked on sewage in the ponds, which is pretty basic.
14:29
And he loved nothing better than highly complex tutorial networks.
14:34
He had published distinguished volumes on a large number of groups of insects.
14:37
So, he
14:43
didn’t hesitate to work on a hard problem.
14:46
That is something that has stayed with me for a long time.
14:51
When I came here I took some of the same approach.
14:53
I’ve always felt that there’s the reason there’s an entomology department at all,
14:58
is because of the implication of that.
15:00
Now, that doesn’t mean you couldn’t have it in other institutions, but
15:03
traditionally where you find them, with U-Kansas as an exception.
15:07
They all have strong agriculture or
15:16
forestry or both.
15:16
When I first got tied up with the Andrews, it made a lot of sense
15:21
to apply my own discipline to
15:26
something like the Andrews.
15:30
There’s no one else doing it I know of.
15:33
The ownership’s been with us for a long, long
15:41
time.
15:42
Recently, as sort of a legacy, I hired a fellow to redo the flora of the Andrews.
15:49
Who’s that?
15:49
That’s Scott
15:53
Schindler, Dr. Scott Schindler
15:57
. Big tall, huge guy.
15:59
Black curly hair, big black beard, you can’t miss him.
16:02
You’d hate to see him lining up opposite you on a football field.
16:04
[Laughter].
16:06
But, he’s a very good systematic botanist.
16:08
He has found about 50 or 60 species that haven’t been recorded before,
16:12
changed all the nomenclature, because
16:18
it’s an old one that was done by Franklin and Dyrness a long time ago, and a lot
16:19
of things have happened since then.
16:21
Since we’re getting some of the entomological system, I
16:23
guess he’s going to do that.
16:25
And so, he’s done that, and I pretty much foot the bill for that, since
16:29
it seemed like a good basis for future studies to help you know what
16:35
the heck you’re doing.
16:36
He’s first trying to produce an electronic version, and then a hard-copy one.
16:41
I’m really pleased he’s made such good progress.
16:45
When did you start working at the Andrews?
16:47
Oh, I started around ‘76.
16:50
You had some questions about things, as I read through your documents,
16:55
and there were some peculiar things that really sort of jogged my memory.
17:00
Have you talked with Roy?
17:00
[Silen-first USFS person at H.J. Andrews EF; called Blue River EF, 1948-53.]
17:01
Yeah, I have.
17:05
Okay, good.
17:06
Because my recollection is that he was the one that actually
17:09
disappeared into the bush, to find what ultimately became the Andrews.
17:13
Yeah.
17:13
On his back he carried his food and everything with him, and just hiked in.
17:17
No roads, no no trails, no nothing.
17:20
You’ve been there haven’t you?
17:21
Yes.
17:21
There’s a lot of up and down.
17:22
How’d you like to do that with a 60-pound pack on your back?
17:26
Oh boy!
17:27
[Laughter] And it’s sad, terribly sad, that his wife was killed [car accident]
17:30
. Yeah, that was tough.
17:31
Just unbelievable, couldn’t believe it.
17:33
He was down there at the Andrews when it happened.
17:35
Did you know that?
17:36
No, I didn’t.
17:36
Yeah, we had a group of people that came down there for oral history work.
17:36
Oh, he did?
17:36
Yeah,
17:40
he was in the group.
17:41
That’s right.
17:42
You said they notified him down there.
17:44
We had a somewhat similar situation very recently.
17:49
Gary Reed,
17:52
who is director of experimentation in Hermiston [OSU Extension/Research] , and
17:54
an entomologist, was here to give a talk, and his son killed himself.
18:01
Oh, geez.
18:02
He learned about it here, was going back up to Portland to pick up his
18:06
wife and his daughter or father, and I think he then had to tell them.
18:10
Oh, man.
18:11
That was really sad to hear.
18:13
It was very, very difficult.
18:16
Boy, those guys had to be something to be able to deal with that,
18:21
and try to find a new life.
18:25
Yeah,
18:37
yeah.
18:52
He credited some of the people he worked with at the Station [PNW]
18:58
, especially at the forest level, for giving some him some good ideas about
19:07
moving forward.
19:07
Well, this is an aside, but it’s relevant somewhere in here.
19:11
You have not talked much about the LTER program yet.
19:13
Not yet.
19:14
Okay.
19:15
I’ve
19:17
been involved in it for a long time, way before LTER ever came into being.
19:22
There was a time when NSF was concerned
19:28
that individuals were wielding too much influence on the shape of the LTER sites.
19:34
I remember being on a [NSF review] panel back there at the time when
19:39
the LTER network was getting going, and if it hadn’t been for a few
19:41
individuals like Jerry Franklin, there wouldn’t be an LTER program.
19:44
We had Franklin and Waring [Dick] , the ones who were the chief movers
19:48
and shakers of the whole thing.
19:51
We had people at other sites the same way.
19:53
And some of those people are still doing it 20 or 25 years later.
19:57
And if they hadn’t had the willingness to just lay their whole career on the
20:02
line, if it hadn’t been by group, it probably never would have happened.
20:07
Nowadays, there a protocol to do it.
20:10
In those early days, this was the first place to be funded.
20:13
They hemmed and hawed, they came back-and-forth, “Do we really want to
20:17
put money on a long-term basis?” which they’d never done before. Not too many
20:21
did, but I think it’s still is the most productive of all the LTER sites - period.
20:28
But you’ve got to keep pumping to do it.
20:29
This thing doesn’t happen by just sitting around, and two or three
20:34
[sites] have been dropped along the way.
20:37
There are 18 now, but originally, if you total them up, we had 21.
20:44
But,
20:46
it took the strength of people, like Walt Whitford at the Jornada site down
20:52
in southern New Mexico, and Dave Tilman over in Minnesota [Cedar Creek LTER
20:56
site] , and Judy Meyer down in Georgia [Coweeta] , and Tim Seastead at Konza
21:03
Tall Grass Prairie; people like that.
21:14
They’re gonna do it, and see that it’s done and finished.
21:18
The people who weren’t able to do it; basically, those
21:21
places went by the wayside.
21:23
Some of them thought they were going to just get all this money and do
21:26
whatever they darn well pleased with it.
21:28
The other thing you need to keep track of is that what
21:33
makes the LTER program unique.
21:35
It originally had and still does, guiding principles about what’s
21:41
supposed to be done, for all sites.
21:44
Every site does it differently, but they all have common themes.
21:48
That’s one of the things that has
21:54
helped, although some people might say it has hindered development.
21:58
I don’t think so, personally.
22:02
I do know, having been involved in this for so darn long, that there are
22:07
people who are not associated with the LTER that really don’t like it.
22:12
They don’t like it because they don’t like the idea of money going to a group.
22:16
They’ve had money of their own all this time, and they don’t
22:18
like the idea of sharing it
22:26
with
22:33
other people, and they think that it isn’t right.
22:33
Reviews of LTER proposals usually have 10 or 15 reviewers, way more
22:34
than normally [on single investigator grant proposals] . And you can
22:36
count on one or two to be up on
22:40
a soapbox, criticizing the whole idea of the thing.
22:45
But the fact of the matter is that NSF considers this [LTER]
22:47
to be their flagship program.
22:49
Like it or not, that’s the way it is.
22:51
So, people who are willing to tie some of their work into LTER
22:55
sites, I don’t think it hurts them.
22:58
It’s no guarantee, if you haven’t got a good proposal, you’re not
23:00
going to get a nickel anyway.
23:02
Nonetheless, they’re trying to strengthen the contributions.
23:05
And none of us have done that.
23:08
I mean if you look at the amount of money that we get from that one program
23:13
per year, and then look at how much money per year is garnered from other
23:17
grants, then we’re way out ahead of what we get form one source alone.
23:22
And we have this collaboration of OSU with the [U.S.] Forest Service
23:25
Research and the national forest [Willamette] . It’s sort of a triumvirate.
23:31
So, moneys are coming in from several sources.
23:32
Not much that I know of comes from Oregon State, though.
23:35
It did for a while, but most of us just go out and get it.
23:39
People are used to that and that’s what you do.
23:42
You can sit around wringing your hands, but you’re not
23:44
gonna get much done that way.
23:45
Now, you were saying there were some people at NSF who were
23:48
concerned that the program was too driven by just individuals?
23:51
Oh no, it wasn’t that.
23:52
NSF went to extraordinary lengths to try to be impartial.
23:52
I mean, it’s
24:02
ridiculous to say that, but they tried to do it, and they say
24:07
they did.
24:07
For example, the people instrumental in establishing LTER programs
24:12
back then, were individuals.
24:14
This was not done by some group action.
24:16
There were a couple people who just felt this was an absolute necessity
24:19
to keep ecology moving, and they took it upon themselves to get it
24:25
going, and they got people, dragooned them, however they recruited them, to
24:31
establish these things in various places.
24:33
And they had constitutions for them, so just putting a proposal
24:36
together didn’t guarantee anything.
24:39
Lots of them got nothing.
24:42
One looks at the map of where the LTER sites are around the world, or
24:45
North America, and there are some holes, partly because no proposals
24:53
that would be accepted by the panel were received from those areas.
24:57
Sometimes it’s a matter of geography.
24:59
You don’t have enough people to do it.
25:02
But Jornada can function at New Mexico State, and that’s not a very big place.
25:08
I’ve been on site visitations there and Albuquerque [Univ.
25:11
of New Mexico] , and they’re pretty thin down there – not a lot of people.
25:14
But, it’s a good thing.
25:15
Some of the folks got along, and they made it go anyway.
25:22
There were a couple of places, one in particular that assumed
25:26
all they had to do was put in a proposal and they would get funded.
25:29
They didn’t get funded and didn’t like that.
25:32
Hopefully they did, five years, maybe ten years later.
25:36
[Chuckle] They thought they’d been around so long they must get the money,
25:40
and those panels don’t work that way.
25:42
Kind of an interesting angle to pursue.
25:45
I wanted to ask, were there particular individuals who stand out in your mind
25:51
at NSF who were behind the LTER areas?
25:55
Yes there were.
25:56
I can only give you some of them, because I don’t know them anymore,
26:01
and I’ve lost some of those memories.
26:04
Art McKee could tell you.
26:06
As a matter-of-fact, Jerry
26:10
Franklin himself was back at NSF.
26:12
And I think, but I’m not dead sure; he was the first program officer for ecosystems.
26:17
Yeah, we talked about that a little bit when I interviewed him.
26:19
I think so, as he was one of the early proponents.
26:23
And another guy, I can’t remember his name, who was
26:34
really responsible for LTER, who said, “We’ve got to do this.” He
26:37
was one of the program officers in the National Science Foundation.
26:42
[Possibly John Brooks]
26:42
Oh.
26:48
I can say that he certainly made it possible.
26:54
More recently, Tom Callahan, has been critical within NSF.
27:05
NSF now has permanent staff members leading LTER, and they
27:07
have these rotators that come in for a year or two to help further.
27:11
Callahan’s
27:16
been a permanent member for 15, 20 years, I guess.
27:23
He’s been responsible for working with interns on ecological
27:26
research for a long time.
27:28
He
27:48
was very soft-spoken, but I had the feeling he was probably very good.
27:51
Our current
28:15
OSU president, Paul Risser, was Vice President for Research at
28:19
the University of New Mexico,
28:24
and was very instrumental in getting an LTER site there.
28:29
There is a tremendous amount of support getting it established there.
28:33
It’s a wonderful place.
28:34
They could start brand new.
28:36
They didn’t have anything there, except they inherited a Spanish land grant of
28:41
two or three hundred thousand acres, which isn’t much down there, as you’ve
28:44
got one cow per thousand acres [Laughter].
28:47
But they’ve got this huge piece of real estate.
28:50
And he was very responsible for
28:56
establishment of that LTER site.
28:57
He also was chairman of the external examining committee for the whole LTER
29:12
program at the end of the 10th year.
30:02
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your involvement with
30:04
people at the Andrews before.
30:06
You became directly involved, you said in about 1976.
30:10
What was your awareness before that of what was going on?
30:11
Well, it was at the
30:15
time the IBP [International Biological Program] was initiated.
30:17
‘68-’69.
30:17
Okay.
30:24
They were meeting downstairs at sort of an organizing meeting.
30:30
I remember going to that.
30:33
I can’t tell you, even if you put a gun to my head [laughter],
30:37
who did the organizing.
30:39
But I remember being told, specifically or generally,
30:46
that there was no room for systematic studies, and that
30:48
was not what this was for,
30:52
but it was for, presumably, ecosystem science.
30:59
I remember at the time thinking, “Gee, that’s too bad, because there’s
31:03
a point-of-view there that has some real relevance to it.” But, it was
31:08
pretty clear that there were certain people that were in it, and they
31:12
just didn’t want that to happen.
31:14
So, there was some entomological work.
31:16
There were people on campus here?
31:18
No.
31:19
This is as it applied here, not nationally.
31:23
Yeah.
31:26
There was one entomologist I can think of, maybe two; one was a forest
31:33
entomologist, and the other one was partly into forest entomology.
31:38
They did competition-dynamics kind of stuff.
31:40
A lot publications came out, sort of gray literature.
31:45
I don’t even know how many copies he printed, hundreds,
31:47
maybe a couple of hundred.
31:49
[Referring to IBP-published reports] They came out with forest green
31:53
covers, and they were published mostly at the University of Washington.
31:58
There must be a vast amount knowledge in there, but they
32:01
certainly aren’t used very much.
32:04
I suppose there are a few exceptions.
32:06
In fact, I suppose they’ll argue that maybe not even all of it is in existence.
32:10
You’d be hard-pressed to find a full set.
32:13
They’re probably in the library.
32:14
I’m not sure.
32:15
And
32:19
I didn’t come in until ’76, when, I don’t even know why, but I was
32:23
asked to come in and organize all this stuff that had been collected.
32:27
I was in charge of the collection here.
32:30
Who asked you to come in?
32:33
I don’t know what particular person.
32:36
The word was passed on to me by Norm Anderson, an aquatic
32:40
entomologist, who retired recently.
32:45
He was down there, too, working in stream dynamics.
32:46
I think
32:50
it was through him that I heard.
32:55
I don’t believe he was the one that invited me, but he was the one that
32:59
passed it onto me, saying, “We would like to see if you’re interested in handling
33:06
it.” I remember going to those early meetings, and it was Waring
33:12
and Franklin. The two of them were responsible, basically, for all
33:19
the operations [IBP-HJA] , and they would collaborate on activities. I
33:25
don’t know as much about Dick as I do about Jerry, who was deeply involved
33:33
in the IBP program.
33:34
At that time there was a sort of division in the way
33:39
they worked.
33:39
Franklin focused more on education and species of plants, whereas
33:42
Waring was more interested in the
33:48
processes.
33:53
There were the people who were very interested in processes, and
33:57
there are still a lot of them.
34:00
But many people are really not, they don’t really care too much about
34:04
who’s doing the processing, as long as something is doing the processing.
34:08
So, there’s a lot of black boxes when you’re studying the processes.
34:12
Well, those black boxes
34:16
[processes] turn out to be insects and other arthropods.
34:20
But, the people more interested in return flows and all that kind of
34:23
stuff, they don’t really care who’s doing it as long as it keeps flowing.
34:25
[Laughter] Well, I care.
34:29
I
34:32
didn’t take long to put the collection together, because there wasn’t that much.
34:36
Out of it grew the
34:40
“H.J. Andrews Forest Arthropod Collection” [Noted collection at OSU] , which
34:43
has about four thousand known species
34:51
in it now. We published this in ‘91 when there were still about 3,600,
34:57
and since then, we’ve added at least four hundred [species] more.
34:57
So, you can take this with
35:13
you.
35:13
Good.
35:13
I just want to point out a couple interesting things.
35:16
One, is that it is the collaborators.
35:20
You can’t do this by yourself, there’s no way.
35:24
I ran into a fellow fanatic from Minnesota, who’s been working up
35:28
there for 20 years, pretty much by himself, doing the LTER site up there.
35:35
So, we’re doing a book on the bugs of Cedar Creek LTER site, because he
35:39
found more than I found at the Andrews.
35:41
I couldn’t get the numbers, he’s got the variety, but when you get down
35:46
to getting people to identify all the stuff [species] , then is when you
35:50
get a lot of people involved, just because there are so darn many of them.
35:55
So, manpower is kind of a limiting factor?
35:56
Well, yeah.
35:57
In the old days it used be easier than it is now, partly because there are
36:02
fewer taxonomists around to do it.
36:06
That’s become a real serious problem in this country
36:12
and outside the country.
36:13
There are groups of insects that, if we knew more about them, would
36:17
be very good [environmental] indicators, but we don’t know enough
36:20
about them to be able to use them.
36:22
We just know that they’re there and they’re doing some things,
36:24
but we can’t tell them apart.
36:27
That’s why I sort of meld my work for applied systematics,
36:30
I guess you could call it.
36:32
Taking systematics and applying it to the solution of real problems.
36:37
And it’s a real problem.
36:40
We’re talking about the importance of the university [OSU] . Is a lot
36:44
of that kind of work done by the university with university funding?
36:48
No, very little.
36:50
I had very little direct funding from the university.
36:56
For a while here, I had two research assistants.
37:00
Part of my salary was paid, and I had an annual budget of anywhere from eight
37:04
hundred to a thousand bucks a year.
37:07
Well, these cameras cost twelve hundred dollars each.
37:10
So, we needed that to go a long ways.
37:14
You can sit around and wring your hands, “Woe is me,” or you
37:18
can go do something about it.
37:19
So, I decided to do something about it.
37:22
In early days I got modest support, but after a while we started producing stuff
37:27
and got solid support for many years.
37:32
I
37:35
used it to create that collection.
37:37
We bought stuff, we did field work, I’d find somebody that had close interests
37:42
to me, I’d bring ‘em in for really a nominal amount, and they would often
37:46
end up collecting on the Andrews, besides identifying species themselves.
37:48
So, a lot of these people have been here, but a lot of them would just come anyway.
37:55
A lot of people liked to help out on something that actually was
38:00
going to accomplish something.
38:01
This is what the manuscript looked like before we finally published it.
38:04
And, as I say exhausting, so somebody else can do the next four thousand
38:11
[species] . [Laughter] But, I was just looking to see, there’s OSU, there’s
38:16
the guy that’s at Berkeley, there’s an entomologist from Hawaii, there’s a
38:18
guy in Mississippi, a guy in Idaho, and
38:26
a Canadian guy.
38:32
A lot of systematists tend to be at universities or a handful
38:38
of state or federal facilities.
38:41
And there is a systematic entomology lab at in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
38:46
It’s based downtown [Washington D.C.] at the Smithsonian, and they work
38:50
right beside the ones that are with the Smithsonian, and they really know
39:01
how to identify stuff.
39:02
In December we brought some out.
39:04
Some were OSU students.
39:10
The Smithsonian has always done stuff for us, even though some people won’t
39:15
do it and nowadays you have to pay.
39:16
It’s sort of an obligation, because there are so few taxonomists around.
39:39
In Florida there’s
39:43
one,
39:45
Illinois has one, and California as well, and that’s really all of them.
39:50
But then, there are very few of them who are interested in doing field
39:54
work, and so they contribute lots and lots and lots of specimens.
39:57
Concerning field work at the Andrews, were there people that
40:04
you worked with more frequently on
40:07
a day-to-day basis?
40:08
Well, you sort of touched on some of that here.
40:12
It
40:22
had to do with granting and
40:26
funding.
40:26
It had to do with encouraging independent work as well as co-operative work.
40:34
And it’s true, because if you went on and got outside funds,
40:37
as most of us did, and still do,
40:42
if some agency gives you money to do things, you obviously have an
40:46
obligation to that agency to do what you said you were going to do.
40:48
You can’t just take it and do what you darn well please.
40:51
The trick is to get it so that it overlaps with some of the things you’re
40:54
trying to do down there, and that’s not difficult, so that you’re really doing
40:58
two things at once, and that’s very good.
40:58
Because, there are
41:04
so few people, other than non-students and a few others
41:08
that are doing this kind of stuff.
41:11
We may be a little more independent.
41:13
What we often did was to support other people’s work.
41:18
But
41:25
a lot of people were really just interested in the processes involved.
41:29
So, until more recently, not a lot of those folks ever had much
41:35
to do with systematic entomology.
41:36
They just didn’t see the value in it.
41:40
I can’t help but think that part of that comes from
41:47
your point-of-view.
41:47
It turns out, and this is my bias, that the point-of-view of the broad
41:52
field of systematics, is a pretty
41:58
big part of the approach to ecological problems.
41:58
The failure to know who’s doing the processing, could come back to bite you.
42:06
Whole systems can suddenly collapse, and you don’t even know why.
42:08
So, one should know the roles of invertebrates.
42:14
If you can do that, then you can certainly do better about
42:18
explaining how ecosystems work.
42:20
But there are those who are more interested in the process.
42:23
That’s all they really care about, and that’s their prerogative.
42:26
But that’s not good enough for me.
42:30
Of course, we’ve worked with so many different agencies,
42:33
basically every agency there is.
42:34
As you can see on the list [C.V.] , I just sent off a big manuscript
42:40
about North Cascades National Park.
42:46
I
42:50
helped them write a grant.
42:53
There are grants that they get to write to the [National] Park Service
42:56
to do the base work that’s then transferred to the other parks.
43:02
I helped them write a grant and we got eighteen hundred [$] a year, for
43:07
a long time.
43:10
Only four received that, and I was one of the four.
43:13
Paid for I think by the DuPont Company.
43:13
I guess they did it to salve their conscience or something.
43:13
So
43:19
one of
43:28
my students did the tramping.
43:29
He did the beetles, I did the bugs.
43:33
And I worked with Acadia National Park, tried to get them going with only modest
43:41
success, because they have a wonderful database – an old one – on which to go.
43:52
And down at Sequoia National Park.
43:54
A whole bunch of people organized by Jerry Franklin [group method called a “pulse”]
43:56
, went down for a couple of weeks, laid out plots, and did all kinds of things.
44:00
So, the Park Service is getting more interested in research.
44:05
They didn’t have very many people do it for years and years and years;
44:10
they’ve been mainly managing people
44:22
[park visitors] . Now,
44:47
they’re
44:55
in a slightly different role, and they’re turning to universities for help.
44:59
And I looked at Rocky Mountain National Park, which is an incredible
45:18
place if you’ve ever been there.
45:29
No,
45:31
I haven’t.
45:31
There’s
45:47
very little public money to support basic systematic ecology, or private money.
45:50
Almost none.
45:51
There is some
45:55
because I got funds from other sources.
45:59
But I found nothing from any industrial forest operation.
46:05
It always was a puzzle to me why this was so.
46:11
I don’t know whether it was deliberate, as that’s not a question I can answer,
46:16
because I don’t know the answer.
46:17
You’d have to talk to Fred, you’d have to talk to Jerry.
46:20
I suspect, but it is only a suspicion, that
46:29
maybe it was an effort to avoid being beholden to anyone.
46:33
If it’s a competitive thing with the NSF, that’s one thing.
46:34
But if
46:38
you’ve got “x” number of dollars from some large timber company, maybe
46:42
there was. Not that these folks didn’t have that kind of money, but they
46:44
didn’t use it on the Andrews. It’s
46:54
never
47:13
happened.
47:13
How come?
47:15
Because, the other thing is, in fact, what you’ve mentioned in there about
47:19
the application of the knowledge.
47:20
And after all the stuff that has come out of there has incredible influence on
47:29
how forests are managed, in spite of some glitches.
47:36
We had one situation I think, where I was in the room, I haven’t heard
47:42
of it now in years, but I wasn’t the only one who heard of it.
47:44
We had a meeting on the Andrews, where we were meeting with the
47:48
former Dean of the [OSU] College of Forestry, and the dean from the college
47:52
of forestry up in Seattle [Univ.
47:53
of Wash.] , came
47:56
down.
47:57
There was a round table and the question was raised about how work
48:04
there influenced other forestry work.
48:09
Fortunately, we had
48:16
a leader of the Forest Service present, a young man who was very closely tied
48:22
with the Forest Service on the Andrews.
48:27
Was it Steve Eubanks?
48:28
Yes.
48:29
He was there.
48:33
The old dean said, “Well, we can’t afford to have an LTER like the Andrews
48:38
for every forest in the country.”
48:44
Steve jumped in
48:49
and said, they needed as much science as they can get. We’ve never got a lot
48:50
of support from that direction as I know
48:59
it.
48:59
It always seemed strange to me there wasn’t more help.
49:03
Now
49:05
with Steve, it’s a whole different ball game.
49:07
When the dean made that statement, Steve said, “That’s not even true. We can
49:10
hardly finish work on the Andrews before it gets used on the ground. That happens
49:15
way before it’s ever even published.
49:16
People are using it all over the country.
49:18
Not just here, not just in Oregon, all over, wall-to-wall,
49:21
state-to-state, coast-to- coast.” So,
49:27
a lot of it was funneled through him, and he said he didn’t know of any other
49:30
place that provided more knowledge, more information, than this place does.
49:35
Bless his heart, and the dean from Washington said
49:38
pretty much the same thing.
49:42
Interesting there was so little support from the OSU dean.
49:43
I don’t know why that was.
49:44
I really don’t.
49:48
He’s still alive, I guess.
49:50
He’s not a scientist by any means.
49:53
I guess he’s an economist.
49:55
I never could quite figure out what the deal was, but there was something
50:05
there.
50:12
The players have changed a little, some of them have retired, some
50:17
have gone onto other things.
50:19
But there’s a remarkable number of people still there, still doing these things.
50:26
As I mentioned to you on the phone, it’s almost like a religion.
50:30
It’s
50:34
not scary exactly, but the people who work there really think
50:36
a great deal of that place.
50:38
I’m not kidding.
50:41
They love to work there.
50:43
They’re all over everywhere, they’re just all over the
50:45
place, but they overlap on the
50:49
Andrews.
50:49
If you’re going to work on the Andrews, you’ve got plenty of latitude to do
50:56
your own thing, and if you need help, if
51:02
somebody needs help and they call for it, they give it
51:09
to them.
51:10
That’s what you’re supposed to do.
51:10
I’ve seen this happen many times, where people who put the
51:14
good of the cause above self.
51:24
They think it’s really important.
51:26
When push comes to shove, they’ll go this way first, they always do this.
51:32
This goes on year after year after year.
51:34
Yeah.
51:35
I’m curious, the way you’ve been talking it sounds like a lot of the entomological
51:37
work at the Andrews gets done
51:43
by graduate students who work for you, is that right?
51:45
Some of it, but not all the people who are involved in that have been grad students.
51:51
One was a guy by the name of Bill Nagel, very early days, and he was
51:55
running the IBP entomology work, and I don’t believe, in fact I’m pretty
51:58
sure he was gone by the time I arrived.
52:02
I’m sure he was.
52:02
I think
52:48
he probably worked on the Andrews a little bit, although we had a lot
53:04
of students doing many things.
53:04
Also, Norm Anderson and his group.
53:06
He’s an aquatic entomologist in the department, recently retired, and he had
53:09
a group of students work on the Andrews for a long time on aquatic insects.
53:14
You really ought to talk to him, because he was in the Stream Team.
53:20
I never could quite figure out where his role was in that,
53:23
because he did all this stuff.
53:26
Eventually, he
53:32
stopped going down there.
53:35
I don’t really know why.
53:36
But he went there a good many years, in
53:41
the early times, the forerunner of the LTER.
53:47
I don’t know when he stopped being directly involved.
53:51
He had his
53:55
students
54:00
do an awful lot of stuff.
54:01
I did involve a lot of my students, but also, friends of mine.
54:07
I’d assist them with science papers and call them in.
54:11
We used to sponsor short courses for taxonomists.
54:15
They brought in various people, people would come to take those courses, and I
54:20
would take the people down to the Andrews.
54:24
A lot of them, some did that work there, as I say, as long as you’re there, you
54:27
might as well do something creative.
54:30
They just liked to do it.
54:31
People like to contribute where something is happening.
54:37
You can get barrels of stuff for
54:43
people that way.
54:43
I have
54:47
about every entomology data-set there is in the United States.
54:53
Certainly this is one of the best-known
55:00
areas around the country,
55:04
because some idiot thinks it’s important and keeps working away
55:08
at it, to get that knowledge.
55:10
And most of it ends up in printed, quasi-printed form.
55:17
So, there are just a handful of sites with comparable information.
55:20
Is the site so well-known because of the kinds of insects that are
55:25
there, or because of the kind of work that’s been done there?
55:28
You mean from an entomological point of view?
55:30
Yeah.
55:30
That’s a tough question.
55:33
I mean, so many species with so few people to know them and do the work
55:38
there, and I would say the broad situation is more based on what people know.
55:46
If somebody has a list of species, I can run my eye down the groups
55:53
I know, I can get a pretty good idea of what’s going on there.
55:56
Even though I know there will be other things that they didn’t get,
55:58
because you just can’t get them all.
56:00
I mean, we have four thousand down there at Andrews and probably another
56:03
four thousand awaiting discovery, but these are mostly these little
56:06
dinky things nobody is working on.
56:06
So,
56:11
you might sit around for a long time before there’s somebody
56:13
crazy enough to want to do it.
56:15
There are ways to do it, and I’ve done that, too.
56:17
Where you pretty much get somebody that doesn’t know what they want to do, and
56:21
I say what about this, and they do that.
56:23
But, the diversity is definitely here.
56:28
We did a calculation on the number of species of vertebrates, which we figured
56:33
out there’s more to find, but the current number is like 186, something like that.
56:38
About 500 species of vascular plants and almost 43,600 species of arthropods.
56:44
Well, that comes out to 85 percent of the diversity is in the insects.
56:50
And some of these other things.
56:51
We talk about it.
56:52
In fact, there’s a book advertised, The Preservation of Biodiversity in Forests.
56:57
I thought that’d be great; there’s not a single arthropod mentioned.
57:01
All
57:07
they were really talking about was wildlife.
57:09
But they took the wildlife out of the title.
57:12
But, all the chapters are
57:23
almost all wildlife.
57:23
That’s a dishonest move.
57:23
[Chuckle]
57:23
A big part of it is there’s a substantial amount of diversity
57:26
there compared to other places.
57:27
Well, I would say, there is a substantial amount of diversity there, yes.
57:36
My feeling is that in this area much of the biological diversity
57:43
as represented by arthropods.
57:47
We’re looking at arthropods found in the foothills now, but there
57:50
are fewer because the floor of the valley has been so highly modified.
57:59
And they include lots of introduced species.
58:00
If you’re goal is just to have a lot of
58:03
things around, that’s one thing.
58:05
But, if you’re trying to maintain natural diversity, then you’ve got
58:09
to have some undisturbed areas, but that’s just unrealistic.
58:13
But
58:21
there is quite a bit of diversity, even here in this little stream
58:25
that goes right by the campus, comes out at McDonald Forest.
58:27
When I first got here I inherited an incomplete
58:34
list of species, I don’t know, with 15-18 species.
58:40
Two years ago, students of Norm Anderson were taking a course from me
58:44
and said, “What can we do?” I said, well, see what you can find in that
58:47
stream. I knew there wasn’t much around.
58:49
They were all present, but way up in the foothills at the headwaters
58:51
of the stream, not down here on the valley floor anymore, but up above.
58:55
So, if you start losing those, they’re gone.
58:56
End of Side A, Tape 1 [of 1]
58:57
Begin Side B, Tape 1 [of 1]
58:57
You have
59:02
to rely on re-introductions.
59:05
And there’s some of that happening.
59:08
It’s sort of a heroic effort.
59:11
There’s a lot of things one can do to help maintain and enhance diversity,
59:16
that isn’t quite as heroic as bringing in fifteen people watching one species,
59:21
like the black ferret, I think in Wyoming.
59:22
They had more biologists in there than they’ve got ferrets.
59:22
[Studying them] So, you can
59:28
do other things.
59:29
I think that’s important.
59:30
That’s why we’ve gotten into conservation
59:36
so much.
59:36
Would you say the Andrews is relatively a typical site, maybe not
59:38
representative, but a typical site?
59:41
No.
59:42
I would say that’s turned out to be assumed.
59:47
I suppose it’s a problem that everyone wants us to take our
59:50
body of knowledge from there, and apply it all over the place.
59:55
Typically, people are reluctant to go do the work.
59:58
They’d much rather get it from somebody else.
1:00:00
So, we’ve written a rather big report for the bureau of forestry or whatever
1:00:05
they call it in British Columbia.
1:00:08
I said, “Why don’t you go out and look at your own forest, and tell
1:00:11
us what you think we’ll find there.” We’ve done a lot of that. It would be
1:00:17
awfully nice if more papers were looked at, and we’ve done some of that with
1:00:25
Bureau of Land Management for some old growth and young stands off the Andrews.
1:00:32
Jeff Miller in particular, has done a lot of that work.
1:00:35
So, we’re getting a better understanding of it.
1:00:38
But the President’s [Northwest Forest Plan] plan, just look at the big mound
1:00:41
of stuff over there, finally came out with what they call a “Record
1:00:45
of Decision” about that, what may be done to the landscape in order to
1:00:50
enhance it [ecosystem management and restoration] . It contains a section
1:00:52
on insects, and we were involved in it because there wasn’t anyone else to do
1:00:56
it. We made our recommendations, and out comes a statement, “thou shalt do these
1:01:00
things, and not do those things.” And moneys appropriated for that are being
1:01:07
used, apparently for other purposes.
1:01:09
I don’t see it getting done
1:01:15
yet, and it really bothers me.
1:01:16
The spotted owl goes all the way down to the Bay Area and Northern California.
1:01:18
I know that area pretty well.
1:01:18
Talk about diversity, you took an Andrews and plunked it on
1:01:20
down in Northern California,
1:01:23
and man, we’d be terrible.
1:01:24
There’s so much more diversity down there.
1:01:29
But,
1:01:34
we are slowly, but surely, building up a body of knowledge
1:01:39
that has it value and utility.
1:01:41
To address that diversity, the idea is to select out of it, those
1:01:50
bits, for which there are adequate taxonomic skills in
1:01:52
the community of entomologists.
1:01:54
If you can’t find someone who can do them, then you’re not gonna do anything,
1:01:56
because you don’t know what you’ve got.
1:01:57
So, you have
1:02:01
to sort of first find out what are the groups that would be useful to
1:02:04
know about, and then find out which ones you can actually work with.
1:02:08
Those numbers come down pretty quick.
1:02:11
There are certain groups that are important enough, that if I had
1:02:16
my life to live over again, I’d see to it that there were more
1:02:20
people out there working on them.
1:02:22
It’s just a little late in the game for me now.
1:02:25
[Chuckle] But, it’s really important to do that.
1:02:29
When I started the group that I worked on with the “true
1:02:33
bugs,” the old fellow I used to
1:02:38
work with focused on the swamp bugs.
1:02:41
His idea was, as was common in those days, “This is my group, and
1:02:45
don’t you come into my pasture.” There were three or four people like
1:02:52
that. The guy knew very well I was one of his last students. Then he went to
1:02:56
Connecticut to work on another group because he couldn’t work on that group
1:02:59
once he left there, as this other guy had
1:03:03
all his stuff.
1:03:03
When he died, he left his collection to the national museum, and that institution
1:03:07
turned out six students in that group.
1:03:10
They’re all doing wonderful jobs all over the place.
1:03:15
It’s such a big group, there’s no way one person could do it all anyway.
1:03:18
It sounds like
1:03:32
your philosophy is, the more people involved the better?
1:03:34
Sure, if you want to make progress.
1:03:37
If you don’t do it that way, you’re never going to get anywhere.
1:05:02
I understand what you’ve been saying, is that the Andrews is the best-known
1:05:05
site for this kind of work, because of the combination of the region’s
1:05:09
diversity, the site, the people who work there, and the funding to work there.
1:05:14
Well, more than that, too.
1:05:15
It’s because of the work that was done there, and it wasn’t done for
1:05:20
that purpose, but we had a database for the owls when that came along.
1:05:24
Nobody else had it.
1:05:24
There wasn’t a single person who did all
1:05:27
of that.
1:05:29
So, Andy Moldenke and I were left, and sat in on those expert panels [formulation
1:05:34
of Northwest Forest Plan] . We were the only ones that knew anything about it
1:05:37
[regional invertebrate biodiversity] , and we had a database nobody else had.
1:05:41
So, it was one that became useful for that reason.
1:05:46
You never can be quite sure how this information will be used.
1:05:52
Sometimes, you can aim it for a certain thing, and then find
1:05:55
it useful in a different way.
1:05:56
For example, we did this for the
1:06:03
Nature Conservancy, and it had to do with threatened and endangered species.
1:06:06
We reviewed all insects
1:06:09
that had been described, and I got rid of a bunch of them, just because
1:06:12
there were so many information gaps.
1:06:16
We added some more, and we now are in the process of reviewing all species
1:06:20
of insects of Oregon for them to select out potentially-threatened species.
1:06:28
Now, for a lot of them, we can only say we haven’t got enough
1:06:31
knowledge to even say that.
1:06:33
But there are some where we do know enough to be able to
1:06:37
make some positive statements.
1:06:40
It’s just the sheer numbers.
1:06:41
The plants; we’ve got about 3,000, maybe 3,500 hundred species of plants.
1:06:46
I’ve got 25,000 species of insects.
1:06:49
Nobody knows them all.
1:06:53
But there are certain insects we know that live in certain situations, and
1:06:56
those situations are heavily-endangered, therefore anything that is dependent
1:07:00
on them is going to have problems.
1:07:01
The wet grasslands habitat is one type of concern, in the valleys.
1:07:07
There is almost nothing left of it.
1:07:10
Most grass you see is introduced, drained, and ditched; all kinds of modifications.
1:07:17
That’s another reason.
1:07:18
But
1:07:20
the people in D.C. wanted to know what we should be concerned with.
1:07:25
People always want to know how many insects are dependent
1:07:30
on old-growth forests.
1:07:32
That depends on who’s asking the question.
1:07:39
That’s a tough.
1:07:39
That’s a very difficult question, for the simple reason, if you look at the
1:07:44
history of the development of these old-growth forests, they’re not very old.
1:07:46
Old-growth Douglas-fir forests have been common in this
1:07:48
region only seven, eight thousand years, maybe not that much.
1:07:53
These insect species have been around way
1:07:58
longer than that, millions of years back.
1:08:01
So, some species require deep shade, some of them
1:08:06
don’t care too much who’s making the shade as long as there’s
1:08:09
moss and some moisture there.
1:08:13
But, you can’t say with certainty that this particular species has evolved
1:08:16
in those old-growth forests, because they haven’t been there that long.
1:08:19
Most species of insects have a much longer developmental life-history than
1:08:25
what you get in old growth forests.
1:08:27
I can’t help but think it’s true for the spotted owl, as that owl didn’t evolve
1:08:32
since old-growth forests were there.
1:08:34
If they did, it would be very, very unusual.
1:08:37
It’s a highly-adaptable bird that goes [range] from Canada to Mexico.
1:08:42
You can’t do that if you don’t know what you’re doing.
1:08:44
[Laughs] They’re very adaptable.
1:08:47
So,
1:08:50
the diversity of insects
1:08:55
and different functional roles they have in ecosystems, make them ideal organisms
1:09:04
for study, especially nutrient-cycling
1:09:10
in the soil.
1:09:11
I’ll tell you but, don’t write it down.
1:09:16
Only because, I have no explanation so I don’t want to tell you.
1:09:21
But, we had a meeting, about a year-and-a-half, two years ago,
1:09:25
with a soil conservation group.
1:09:28
This one guy was very excited, and said, “Did you realize there
1:09:29
are living things in the soil?” I said, “Well, I’ve known this
1:09:39
for a long
1:09:42
time.” We’ve had the Soil Conservation Service with us for a very, very,
1:09:45
very, long time; seventy-five years.
1:09:46
Its basic emphasis has been on biochemistry, biophysics,
1:09:53
water, and fertilizer.
1:09:56
All of a sudden, they discover there
1:10:04
are living things down there.
1:10:05
I’m delighted they
1:10:19
finally recognized it.
1:10:24
We must have ten or fifteen people on campus working
1:10:29
on these parts of soil activity.
1:10:30
They were
1:10:37
going to put their base references underneath seed test fields, and
1:10:53
I said, “Why don’t you try a natural a grassland and let that be your base?”
1:11:00
“Because,” they said, “they’ve been burned and sprayed with pesticides
1:11:04
and fertilizers.” So I said, “I doubt there’s very much under there anyway,
1:11:08
and to use that as your baseline would give you a really bad picture.” So, they
1:11:15
said, “That sounds like a good idea.” They’ve taken a few samples in the
1:11:18
seed test fields, and there’s nothing.
1:11:21
So, they’re beginning to see the importance I see.
1:11:25
That will be a wonderful step forward, to recognize what I and
1:11:32
other people have recognized for a long time; that those organisms
1:11:35
are critical to the nutrient-cycle.
1:11:39
There
1:11:46
are lots and lots of tiny little things about which we know remarkably little.
1:11:50
But they’re there in great numbers, and they’re there at maybe three
1:11:54
or four hundred species per square meter, which is a lot.
1:12:15
There has been a lot of work done in the last year on organisms
1:12:20
that live in the soil, and more recently on their functional roles.
1:12:25
And more importantly, in the forest system, the nutrient-cycle.
1:12:29
That’s very important because in grass fields, as people
1:12:32
still go out and spray a lot.
1:12:33
And you can’t do much manipulation in a forest, well, a few people and
1:12:37
places do, but by-and-large, you’ve got to rely on natural processes.
1:12:40
We’ve got to understand what’s going on.
1:12:43
So, they’ve changed forestry practices.
1:12:46
We used to take all coarse woody debris off the Andrews, and now they leave it.
1:12:53
In some places, they have to put it back in.
1:12:56
But most importantly, these are long-term resources for nutrients.
1:13:01
That’s changed the practices of forestry.
1:13:04
The problems have shifted to young stands.
1:13:09
That’s what you’ve got.
1:13:10
Most of the forests that have been cut, certainly on private land,
1:13:12
we’ve got a 40-year or 50-year life-cycle [cutting rotation] , you
1:13:16
aren’t going to get any old stuff.
1:13:18
What are you giving up to do that?
1:13:21
How long can you take the nutrients out on a 40-year cutting rotation?
1:13:22
It grows in about 250, 300-year cycles, in the natural fire regime.
1:13:22
It probably takes a while for organic material to accumulate in the soil.
1:13:23
So,
1:13:41
if
1:13:45
you harvest it sooner than that, you may run out of nutrients.
1:13:50
But, I’m way too busy doing forestry.
1:13:55
Some people are worried about that.
1:13:58
I would say that a major contribution to the understanding how forests function,
1:14:06
is a recognition of the presence and the roles of these microorganisms,
1:14:06
including micro-arthropods and bacteria, and other micro-organisms, and what
1:14:21
they contribute.
1:14:24
I was wondering if you could talk about how you perceive your research
1:14:28
interests at the Andrews to have changed over the time that you’ve
1:14:33
been involved there since IBP.
1:14:35
Yeah.
1:14:37
That was why I was asked to come over.
1:14:40
They had all this stuff they didn’t know what to do with it.
1:14:41
So they said, “How about this guy Lattin? He does that kind
1:14:44
of stuff.” So we did that.
1:14:46
But I must confess, when I first went to
1:14:53
the Andrews in ‘76, I thought it was dull [Chuckle].
1:14:55
It didn’t look like there was much going on there, entomologically-speaking.
1:14:58
Well, obviously, there was a lot going on.
1:15:01
And as I say, exhaustion set in after three, four, five hundred species.
1:15:07
So,
1:15:11
other people had to do more.
1:15:11
It made me realize first-hand, how much that was out there.
1:15:17
As long as you’re interested in a significant group, and the group
1:15:17
I’m interested in is a modest-sized species, I suppose there’re forty,
1:15:18
fifty thousand in the world.
1:15:18
For North America, there are seven, eight thousand species – maybe.
1:15:20
And there are
1:15:35
so darn many of all these other
1:15:49
groups.
1:15:49
That’s what makes them such good things to work with.
1:15:52
They’re small in size, they’re large in number, and many of
1:15:56
them have very specific roles.
1:15:58
So, you can pack a whole bunch of them into a place, whereas maybe there’s only
1:16:02
one elk because they’re so darn big.
1:16:03
You can have four thousand species of insects in the same
1:16:06
place where there is one elk.
1:16:08
So, it helps to make it more apparent that we’re not making this all up.
1:16:15
And though I hear some of these number estimates of how many species there are,
1:16:19
no one had any idea that there would be that many in a forest like the Andrews.
1:16:24
That’s the kind of stuff, you go to the tropical forest, there’s a
1:16:26
lot more to be sure, but, you know, they planned on a few species.
1:16:30
I must have been among them as well, but there’s evidence that that’s not true.
1:16:35
So as recently as ‘76, that was kind of your perception
1:16:38
of what you would find there?
1:16:38
As I say, my first personal perception of being there was,
1:16:42
“This is a pretty dull place.
1:16:43
There doesn’t seem to be much going on here.” A curious thing is, if you
1:16:47
compare the diversity of the arthropods versus any other group found there,
1:16:54
the others don’t even come close.
1:16:55
If you take a look at tree species,
1:17:00
and I haven’t counted them, but there’s just a handful.
1:17:04
There are probably eight thousand species of arthropods.
1:17:18
If you take the trees to represent the diversity, it’s pretty darn low.
1:17:25
You go farther south into the California forests then you get many,
1:17:30
many more tree species, as they’ve got a real mixed bag of species.
1:17:34
And the farther north you go, of course, the more homogeneous it
1:17:41
becomes.
1:17:41
With the Andrews, they’re trying to go, into regionalization.
1:17:43
Are we going to stay in one spot, or does the information apply to a broader area?
1:17:54
We’ve looked at the insects
1:18:01
all over Western Oregon and Washington, British Columbia, and California.
1:18:06
So, we can begin to get a picture of the region.
1:18:09
I guess one of my goals, if I’ll live long enough to do
1:18:16
it, is to analyze where every species occurs.
1:18:21
I’d probably have to do it just with the bugs that would overlap on the Andrews.
1:18:34
There are, for example, a lot of them on the west side.
1:18:39
And there are east side
1:18:42
desert species that come over the ridge tops.
1:18:45
And there are some from California that come up, especially when it’s hot.
1:18:48
If you’re out and busy in the summer, it’s hot and dry down there, and
1:18:51
they don’t know that it’s raining the other nine months of the year.
1:18:54
There’s some from the north coming down.
1:18:56
So, there are these various components that all come together, and they all
1:19:00
live on the Andrews in different places.
1:19:03
That, I think would help to explain how these things are
1:19:06
deployed in that environment.
1:19:09
That to me would be really interesting, and we’re beginning
1:19:12
to get a picture of that.
1:19:12
And then, you can
1:19:17
see these inconsistencies; there are lots of these and very few of those.
1:19:22
What is it about that habitat that results in more of these than those?
1:19:27
Are you suggesting that the answer to that question lies in the Andrews?
1:19:32
If you look back in history about eight thousand years ago, in a warm
1:19:34
dry period, a lot of the expansion of the ranges of some species that
1:19:49
came up from the south, occurred then, so that along the river, down
1:19:53
even south of Corvallis, you can see these great big ponderosa pines, too.
1:19:57
Not many, but some.
1:19:58
There were a lot more in the past.
1:20:02
That group is genetically-related to the ponderosa pine in Northern
1:20:05
California, but not to those on the other side of the mountains.
1:20:07
So, when it got dry and warm, they came up this way.
1:20:10
So did oak, manzanita, and a whole bunch of other things.
1:20:14
Some of these species are still hanging out here, and if their period
1:20:16
of activity is during the warm, dry summer, they don’t know the
1:20:20
difference, and they could still do it.
1:20:24
We have those on the Andrews, where it certainly rains a lot.
1:20:31
But we have a very distinct xeric component, a dry component.
1:20:37
Two different kinds; one is hot-dry, and the other one is cold-dry.
1:20:39
Up
1:20:42
on
1:20:49
those rocky ridges you get the cold-dry component.
1:20:52
So, you could begin to break down that fauna and get a better understanding.
1:20:57
But
1:21:01
there are still some awfully tough questions that I can’t answer,
1:21:05
and it’s going to be awhile before anybody can, I think.
1:21:09
Why are there more of one species or one group than another?
1:21:16
We won’t get into that, especially when you’re dealing
1:21:19
with, larger geographical areas.
1:21:32
One
1:21:56
group of predators in that same area, has maybe fifteen species, the whole
1:22:01
family, fifteen, eighteen species, in the whole of western North America.
1:22:06
How can this one genus have so many?
1:22:08
And these others ones have so few?
1:22:11
I sure don’t know the answer.
1:22:12
The basic question is:
1:22:26
why do some groups have more species than other groups?
1:22:30
What’s kind of your vision for
1:22:41
that?
1:22:41
What
1:22:46
I’m trying to do is just bring together knowledge, some knowledge
1:22:49
that may be useful to build on.
1:22:51
I will do as much as I can until I can’t do
1:22:56
it anymore.
1:22:56
There are some wonderful, interesting questions.
1:22:59
And we tried.
1:23:00
Our site has certainly taken the lead in biodiversity, an interest in
1:23:03
biodiversity, to the LTER program.
1:23:03
We’ve always been
1:23:08
way out ahead of everybody else.
1:23:10
Many of the sites have very little, partly because the
1:23:13
people there just wouldn’t do it.
1:23:15
They just don’t have anybody that will do it, or that could do it.
1:23:19
There are a few now that are starting.
1:23:21
Tilman commissioned a book on the bugs of the Cedar Creek LTER site,
1:23:28
and that’s going to be great.
1:23:29
Tilman
1:23:34
is very much interested in the people down at University of New Mexico.
1:23:38
They started off doing that kind of thing, and that’s great.
1:23:44
But the people down in South Carolina and Georgia, wanted to, but
1:23:49
didn’t have anybody willing to do
1:24:01
it.
1:24:02
Obviously, this work has to do with
1:24:11
ecosystem function.
1:24:12
The
1:24:41
other thing I noticed, and I don’t understand it either, is that the
1:24:47
water people I know are systematists.
1:24:50
They
1:24:56
can’t seem to make the connection between the groups of critters they
1:25:01
work with, and their functional roles in
1:25:11
ecosystems.
1:25:11
Is that the site experience that you were talking about earlier?
1:25:14
Yeah, but I know a lot of other people have had it.
1:25:20
For some reason, California has never been involved in LTER.
1:25:26
I find in the big programs, California always acts differently, and for some
1:25:32
reason, they’ve never put in a site.
1:25:39
My long-time colleague Paul Oleman, did what was probably one of the
1:25:45
finest applied entomology studies.
1:25:46
He was with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for
1:25:52
30 years.
1:25:53
When I got back into administration, he took my place.
1:25:56
So, he came here and we got to know each other very well.
1:25:59
And he was an applied systematist, too.
1:26:03
It was just nice to have a kindred spirit.
1:26:05
He thought nothing of doing something like this that has no economic
1:26:10
importance, although it now suddenly has more importance, for other reasons.
1:26:14
But he also worked on some of the toughest darn
1:26:21
questions that we thought were about diseases.
1:26:22
Some people sort of back away from difficult problems, but he got right in
1:26:25
the middle of them until it was solved.
1:26:27
He was a bull dog [chuckle] who wouldn’t stop.
1:26:29
He’s
1:26:32
one
1:26:36
of
1:26:58
the only people that has done Mount St. Helens, before and after [eruption]
1:27:02
. This is where he went, over this area.
1:27:05
He’d been through the area four, five, six years, before the thing blew, and
1:27:08
he worked seven some years after that.
1:28:08
He was, among other things, head of the systematic entomology laboratory
1:28:12
for the USDA for many years.
1:28:15
He was deputy director of the Entomology Research Service,
1:28:16
which was like the ARS, just for
1:28:22
entomology.
1:28:24
These folks solved problems; this was their job.
1:28:27
It made sense to apply your knowledge to solving a real problem.
1:28:33
Some people that I know in this field are more interested in just
1:28:37
the classification of these groups.
1:28:38
They
1:28:43
are less interested in the biology and ecology.
1:28:46
But there are people who are, there’s no
1:28:52
doubt about that.
1:28:56
I’ve tried letting all the students that I’ve had, tried to get them
1:29:00
interested to see the relevance.
1:29:03
And many of them have.
1:29:06
Not all, but the guy that went to London, was the first Yank
1:29:10
that they ever hired at England’s International Institute of Entomology.
1:29:12
They handle all the entomological problems that fall in the British Empire.
1:29:15
He’s running both their Ph.D. programs.
1:29:15
He’s used to putting his
1:29:27
head down until you solve the damn problem
1:29:51
and get onto the next problem [Laughs].
1:29:54
Well,
1:29:57
the shifting of gears here, to the logistics of working at the Andrews.
1:30:04
When you went down there to do field work, did you typically
1:30:06
spend nights there, or commute?
1:30:09
Well, I’ve done both.
1:30:13
We got used to just driving down there, leaving at 4:00 or 5:30
1:30:18
in the morning, and coming back.
1:30:19
What I’d usually do, is I’d work, and I’d work my way up
1:30:24
to a certain point, ‘till dark.
1:30:25
Then I had to get home, had to go back down and come back home.
1:30:29
So, it’s 11:00 at night.
1:30:32
They were sort of long days, and sometimes we’d stay there.
1:30:35
But, in the early days, the facilities were limited, to say the least.
1:30:44
The shower floor caved in under an owl crew member
1:30:50
[in trailer] – that kind of stuff.
1:30:53
Oh gosh, you can’t believe what’s down there now.
1:30:53
One of my former students, Jerry Halloway, stayed down there all summer
1:30:56
two or three summers, working on little spiders and forestry systems, and he
1:31:01
lived there basically all summer long.
1:31:04
I remember some of the students complaining, “Doesn’t
1:31:06
that guy ever go to bed?”
1:31:10
[Laughter] He had quite a work ethic.
1:31:12
He went in there and worked his tail off.
1:31:17
By helping other people in their work,
1:31:25
we would get some of that material to augment the collection.
1:31:28
The fellow who is the lead author on this publication [Invertebrates of the Andrews
1:31:31
Forest] , Gary Parsons, did that because
1:31:37
he was a real guru on computers.
1:31:39
He did
1:31:43
a study and took 5,600 samples on the Andrews, four times a year for two years.
1:31:54
He worked for a long time, but never finished it.
1:31:58
He collected all this stuff, and
1:32:08
my only insistence has always been, “If you’re going to use his stuff,
1:32:12
you’re going to put his name on it.
1:32:13
After all, if it weren’t for his work, you wouldn’t have anything to do.” So,
1:32:16
he did this and saw it through, and I think he deserves to be senior author.
1:32:23
The second author was one of my other students, and he did
1:32:26
an awful lot of the work, too.
1:32:28
Jerry, that’s the guy from Australia.
1:32:31
Then there are these others, Norm [Anderson] and those folks, and
1:32:33
Andy [Moldenke] gets a lot of species included from his work
1:32:38
in the litter and soil sides of
1:32:44
things.
1:32:45
He took these samples in the lower foothills of the Andrews, and it’s the
1:32:49
best database on these kinds of critters.
1:32:55
Andy especially, has gone in and subsampled a lot of that, and found
1:33:00
the diversity and identifications, and has done all kinds of analysis.
1:33:05
But
1:33:12
he had so much repetition, and just a lot of knowledge, so it’s slowly,
1:33:17
but surely seeing the light of day.
1:33:18
It’s made a big difference.
1:33:18
He did all this
1:33:24
species identification work and put all this stuff on computers.
1:33:27
It’s now on-line, and there’s a web page.
1:33:30
I can’t imagine anybody wanting to download 168 pages, but there it
1:33:42
is.
1:33:43
It also contains
1:33:48
a comparison between three places: the Andrews, the Pawnee National
1:33:54
Grasslands outside Fort Collins, which is
1:34:00
now an LTER site,
1:34:08
and Acadia National Park in Maine, which has this wonderful database on arthropods.
1:34:12
I can never get them
1:34:14
to use it
1:34:19
right.
1:34:20
People back there finally located a lot of the collection, and now they’re
1:34:24
trying to decide what to do with it.
1:34:27
They don’t have anybody there.
1:34:30
So,
1:34:33
I just don’t know what will happen.
1:34:34
Most big museums that could fit it in, would just amalgamate it [into
1:34:38
corpus of their collections] , but it loses integrity by doing that.
1:34:43
So, I said we would handle it if they want it, but it makes
1:34:46
more sense if it was back there.
1:34:58
Now,
1:35:03
how long was Parsons out there taking these samples?
1:35:07
He was out there for two years; four times a year, for two years.
1:35:12
So,
1:35:15
you probably better ask him.
1:35:16
He’s here.
1:35:18
Yeah, he’s working with Jeff Miller right now, and he worked for the [OSU]
1:35:18
Extension Service for quite a while, gained a lot of practical experience.
1:35:19
He loves beetles, so he loves it when a beetle becomes work.
1:35:36
He must have been down at the Andrews for a long time, yeah?
1:35:38
Oh, he was there a lot.
1:35:39
And he had funnels down there all over the place.
1:35:43
These things would come back, and all these little things floating around
1:35:49
in there.
1:35:49
[Chuckle] And other people have done the same thing.
1:35:51
I have a student that worked on insects, a group of insects, living on noble
1:35:54
firs at higher elevations, mainly because I knew this tree had more of
1:35:59
these bugs than any other kind of fir.
1:36:02
And I don’t know why, I still don’t know why, but they did.
1:36:05
He did that for his thesis, and was down there all the time.
1:36:07
Then he went throughout the
1:36:14
range of the species, including up to Mt. Rainier.
1:36:14
The guys drove all the way up there to collect them, and they said, “Well,
1:36:17
we just decided to go two days before, but we had to apply for a permit two
1:36:19
weeks in advance.” Meanwhile they’re up there and are told, “Go back and
1:36:22
apply, and then come back.” They said, “Forget it,” and stuck to the Andrews.
1:36:29
He did a very nice job, so we had some idea of the diversity there.
1:36:31
Most of the students included some work
1:36:39
on the Andrews, a few worked almost entirely on the Andrews.
1:36:43
I had one that worked
1:36:48
on ten transects that cross the river near the concrete bridge.
1:36:49
And
1:36:52
he’s probably my last Ph.D. student.
1:36:54
His project is about how to define the riparian zones by
1:36:58
means of the insects found there.
1:37:01
Who is this?
1:37:01
His name is Greg Brenner, and he’s now with the national parks in Hawaii.
1:37:06
And he’s finishing up; he’ll be back after
1:37:10
the first of the year, to finish this up.
1:37:13
Mercifully, nature gave us an opportunity for a before and after, to study,
1:37:14
because of the big flood . So, the year after the flood, I had a guy go down
1:37:23
and put in transects as close as you could get to Greg’s.
1:37:25
The whole place was reorganized.
1:37:27
And now he’s looking over that material, so he can compare that against what Greg
1:37:31
had in a relatively undisturbed situation.
1:37:34
So, it’s a work-in-process now?
1:37:36
Yeah, and it’s not surprising, with not only the same players,
1:37:39
but the same general area.
1:37:41
It’s not the first time that’s flooded, maybe not as vigorously in past events.
1:37:44
Yeah.
1:37:45
It’s curious to me a number of people have talked about how, with the LTER,
1:37:51
they tended to rely more on post-docs
1:37:56
instead of graduate students.
1:37:57
But most of your work it sounds like it was graduate students?
1:37:58
Yes, that’s true.
1:38:07
I did overlook one more person that I shouldn’t forget.
1:38:11
Gerry Kranz
1:38:15
is a microbiologist.
1:38:17
He retired many years ago, but during the IBP time, he did a
1:38:21
paper with several other people on
1:38:26
some organisms.
1:38:26
He never worked on the Andrews after that, that I’m aware of.
1:38:32
He’s really one of the distinguished microbiologists in the world.
1:38:36
But, there were very few people here willing to work there, so it isn’t a
1:38:42
matter of having a large bunch of folks on the faculty working down there.
1:38:46
We had a forest entomologist who did some and then he left, Tim
1:38:50
Schowalter, who works down there on
1:38:59
forest entomology, and he’s also an ecosystem scientist.
1:39:04
He’s very much interested, it would help to talk to him to get his
1:39:07
perspective, because it would be unfair of me to put words in his mouth.
1:39:10
He’s more interested in the role of insects in forested systems, particularly
1:39:15
those involved with canopies found in different stages of young stands.
1:39:23
He’s been interested in that kind of stuff, and he works on decomposition, too.
1:39:28
He had a big project
1:39:33
on the decomposition of coarse woody debris.
1:39:38
He’s had these decomposition plots at a lot of LTER sites.
1:39:40
He’s gone off the Andrews for a lot
1:39:47
for his work.
1:39:49
He’s probably closer to someone really interested principally in forest insects
1:39:55
and their ecological roles in forests.
1:40:01
We have others now like Jeff Miller, who’s starting to do his work down there.
1:40:07
He and his students are doing some sampling.
1:40:14
[High resolution data on
1:40:22
lepidoptera in the Andrews] That’s one of the reasons I thought, “Well,
1:40:26
let’s get the flora well-known down there,” because he was coming up with
1:40:31
this wonderful knowledge of where the biodiversity occurs among plants
1:40:55
down there – it’s
1:40:57
in the meadows. He’s finding many lepidoptera species, and
1:41:01
has reared an awful lot of them.
1:41:05
I don’t
1:41:16
know, three, or four, or five hundred species now.
1:41:16
He takes good color pictures of the larvae, the way you must do to get
1:41:19
solid knowledge on those organisms.
1:41:21
So, we’re getting a whole lot, a mixed-level of investigation.
1:41:25
One of his students is working on the first study on the
1:41:29
micro-distribution patterns of
1:41:35
butterflies.
1:41:35
That’s one of the reasons we had Scott [Schindler] go up and
1:41:36
botanize both those habitats; to see what host plants are there.
1:41:37
So,
1:41:59
we’re beginning to get a better, a broader picture.
1:42:13
You just don’t have an army of folks ready to pack themselves up and do that.
1:42:15
You could be working down there and not come back for
1:42:18
a long time.
1:42:19
Now Jeff’s up
1:42:23
there for five years
1:42:28
I think
1:42:43
I could hire a technician, but I’d like to hire a graduate student to do it, because
1:42:47
they get the practice from doing it.
1:42:48
That to me was pretty natural, because I had a GRE for
1:42:51
a long time.
1:42:52
We’ve got
1:43:16
two people
1:43:41
working on spiders, including a really good post-doc.
1:43:43
We do not have very many people that are
1:43:49
there working in permanent positions, and that’s always been
1:43:58
a problem.
1:43:59
Almost all the people have courtesy appointments.
1:44:01
Most of them
1:44:05
are
1:44:11
either employees of the Forest Service or on grants, like Mark’s [Harmon] situation.
1:44:14
He’s there on grants for years.
1:44:15
Yeah.
1:44:15
I think he
1:45:22
started working in the IBP days.
1:45:25
I’m not sure how far back he goes, but quite a ways.
1:45:28
Could be, I’ll be talking to him next week.
1:45:31
I
1:45:33
think that he
1:45:36
got a promotion recently.
1:46:48
That’s been kind of a central theme in this study here, you might have noticed.
1:47:00
When you think about your work, how much involvement did you have
1:47:04
with people at the district level or the forest management level?
1:47:09
Well,
1:47:12
some of the people had a lot, much more than I did.
1:47:16
Their problems
1:47:19
were in silviculture stand physiology problems.
1:47:23
So people like Dave [Perry] and
1:47:28
Fred [Swanson] , of course, were relevant.
1:47:29
Fred was in the Forest Service, you can’t even tell the difference.
1:47:31
Some of these folks, it’s pretty tough to tell who’s with which institution.
1:47:37
But, anybody that needed insect help, we just did it, that’s all.
1:47:43
They just didn’t have a lot of need for help.
1:47:46
We were able to help them sometimes.
1:47:49
But, over
1:47:56
the years, what
1:48:02
I’ve
1:48:41
noticed is that slowly, but surely, whenever they
1:48:48
were talking some major project, they would start including arthropods,
1:48:50
which they never did before.
1:48:52
So, now it is pretty much standard practice for a new investigation,
1:48:57
large-scale investigation, there will be usually be an
1:49:01
insect component.
1:49:03
About
1:49:12
when did that start becoming designed in?
1:49:15
You said LTER 3 was the beginning?
1:49:16
I was involved in LTER 1 and LTER 2.
1:49:16
I got funded from all of those.
1:49:16
I think we were in LTER 3 and LTER 4 also.
1:49:16
They only picked out three or four of us to join, as they had a lot of people.
1:49:17
Before, they didn’t have so many.
1:49:17
Well, I don’t know about the first one, can’t remember, it’s been a long time.
1:49:17
They were always pretty encouraging to us.
1:49:17
We tried to
1:50:09
always be productive, and we tried to always be helpful to the
1:50:13
people on the various projects.
1:50:15
And out of that we gained specimens, and they gained more knowledge.
1:50:21
So, it was a mutual thing.
1:50:32
I gather
1:51:12
your work with the district depended pretty much on whether they ask
1:51:16
for help on a specific project?
1:51:17
Well, yeah.
1:51:19
After all, we have people like Steve Eubanks,
1:51:36
who was an extraordinary individual and came up with a way of cutting [timber]
1:51:36
to take a long-term view instead of just getting the timber cut out.
1:51:36
We also have lots of conversations on insects.
1:51:38
For example, he talked about having them bring the gypsy moth and put
1:51:42
it in the Andrews, to stir things
1:51:51
up a bit.
1:51:56
I tried to learn more about management issues.
1:51:58
I had an incredible amount to learn about forestry – still do.
1:52:02
So I could participate in the discussions.
1:52:03
But I can’t help but think, again this is my bias, that the viewpoint of
1:52:09
the systematists isn’t all that bad.
1:52:11
I mean, you’d look at some of these things very differently than the people
1:52:16
who are only interested in the processes.
1:52:18
And you maybe make people think of them differently, and I know I
1:52:26
did.
1:52:29
I thought a long time, “What would it be like if I never had done that?”
1:52:34
All I can say is that life is a heck of a lot more fun than I think it
1:52:37
would have been the other way. I mean that’s probably not fair, because you
1:52:40
only have one life, so you don’t know [Chuckle]. But, I’ve learned so much.
1:52:46
Many of these people are deeply involved in the development of all these ideas.
1:52:49
You’d have to be a clod not to pick up some of that.
1:52:53
It makes you reexamine your own stuff, in different ways that you never would do
1:53:01
otherwise.
1:53:01
Having had some experience in applied entomology didn’t hurt, simply because
1:53:07
it helped make the connection between
1:53:11
basic research and applied research.
1:53:13
But there are
1:53:20
people that absolutely refuse to do any applied work at all.
1:53:26
I know a couple of people at the Smithsonian that brag about the
1:53:30
fact they’ve never ever done one
1:53:35
thing of that kind in their life.
1:53:36
Now, I’m getting old and don’t care, but I’d say, “I’d sure not brag about
1:53:44
that if I were you” [Laughter]. Sometimes you’re in a situation where you’re
1:53:47
not able to do it, sometimes it comes accidentally. But to decide to not
1:53:52
do it, doesn’t make any sense at all.
1:53:55
If I understood you right earlier, you were saying that in entomology, at least,
1:53:58
it’s relatively rare not to do any applied
1:54:04
work?
1:54:04
Times have changed so much, and departments have changed so much.
1:54:09
There are fewer of them now.
1:54:13
I have to preface this by not blaming or saying that
1:54:16
anybody else is doing it wrong.
1:54:23
For one thing, most departments of entomology are at land-grant
1:54:28
schools, almost without exception.
1:54:29
As I said, University of Kansas, is about the only other one, and Cornell has one,
1:54:36
but that’s a combination of a land-grant school and a liberal arts university.
1:55:15
Over the years, some of the smaller places have gradually reduced their
1:55:30
departments of entomology.
1:55:31
Utah State
1:55:34
created a single department that includes entomology, zoology, botany, and biology,
1:55:40
and entomology is having a very hard time.
1:55:49
They got a new chairman who doesn’t like
1:55:56
entomology.
1:56:00
Smaller schools, New Hampshire
1:56:04
is
1:56:08
in there.
1:56:08
I don’t know how they
1:56:21
can keep it.
1:56:23
They have like one graduate student, and it can’t possibly last.
1:56:23
I did a survey with the Department of Agriculture on
1:56:23
where systematic resources were.
1:56:23
And there were about ten
1:56:28
institutions, and this was twelve years ago.
1:56:29
Ten institutions that produced about 80-90% of the Ph.D.’s among entomologists,
1:56:29
of which Oregon State is one.
1:56:29
Then, if you look further, about 25 people were in entomology and most
1:56:29
of the students were grad students.
1:56:30
About 20?
1:56:30
About 25.
1:56:30
And many of those were in retirement years.
1:56:30
So,
1:56:45
by now, the numbers must be very much lower.
1:56:45
There are lots of entomological
1:57:14
problems out there that need to be solved and resolved.
1:57:18
And they’re getting tougher, they’re not getting easier.
1:57:21
With the disappearance of systematists, it’s a big problem.
1:57:24
I was on a panel for two years with the Office of Technology Assessment [U.S.
1:57:29
Congress] on introduced organisms.
1:57:30
That was very interesting, I’ll tell you.
1:57:33
Got together a group of us, and we produced this volume.
1:57:37
OTA is an investigative branch of Congress.
1:57:41
The most recent Congress said we don’t need to have an investigative
1:57:44
branch, after 25 years, we don’t want to know anything anymore.
1:57:48
[Laughter] I couldn’t believe it.
1:57:49
I absolutely couldn’t believe it.
1:57:50
This
1:57:52
work has been highly regarded.
1:57:54
The decision to stop funding this work had nothing to do with the people who do it.
1:57:56
They just decided that they don’t need to know.
