[Introductory remarks by Max Geier on
00:18
purpose of study and focus of interview].
00:18
Now, if
00:22
I’ve
01:04
got this right, your first involvement on the Andrews was in 1953?
01:09
1953. I was a sophomore in college at
01:15
Oregon State University, and every year they’d come around asking
01:19
students what jobs they wanted.
01:22
Until then, I had been working for the fire protection people, and I
01:26
had worked for Eastern Lane [County] Fire Patrol the year before, and
01:28
decided I’d had enough of fire.
01:28
[Laughs] This job [HJA] sounded interesting, so I signed up for it.
01:28
Where were you fire-fighting before then?
01:28
I worked for Eastern Lane Fire
01:49
Patrol near Cottage Grove, and I was a foreman of a crew down there.
01:57
But it was a terrible summer, and I remember I spent most of my
02:00
summer doing nothin’ but waiting for fires, and it was too boring.
02:05
Did you do painting or anything?
02:06
Yeah.
02:06
[Laughing] We painted rocks and
02:10
we cleared some trails.
02:13
So, that was interesting, and we had a couple of fires, but for
02:14
the most part, nothing really
02:18
exciting.
02:20
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your background up until
02:28
that point, personal and academic, up until you got involved at OSU?
02:30
Well, I went to a high school in Forest Grove, Oregon.
02:36
My dad,
02:39
actually, both my parents, worked for,
02:48
I forgot what it’s called, the Northwest Oregon District of the
02:53
Oregon Department of Forestry.
02:57
They moved there in 1946, and that’s when I moved there with them, and we lived
03:02
right there on the grounds of the place.
03:06
That was the year after the Tillamook burn, the big fire, and
03:10
so, they were reorganizing then
03:15
to rehabilitate the Tillamook burn.
03:21
The state had just taken over, and up until then, it had been an
03:24
association paid for by the private landowners, but the state had taken
03:28
over because they’d gone broke with the forest burned by the Tillamook fire.
03:35
That’s where I started out working, actually [laughing],
03:41
I started the year before that.
03:43
I was 15-years-old, and it was 1945.
03:45
I worked on the McKenzie River on
03:50
the Eastern Lane Fire Patrol,
03:55
very near the town of Blue River at a place called Sparks Ranch.
04:01
It was a boarding house, we boarded there and lived in a tent.
04:05
We had a small fire crew, and that was my first job.
04:10
My parents moved to Forest Grove, and I worked for Northwest Oregon
04:15
District in the summer on a fire crew,
04:22
and then, I went into military service, came back and went back to work for
04:30
Eastern Lane and Western Lane.
04:32
There’s two different fire crews, and it was after that that I’d
04:37
finally had my fill of fire.
04:39
I didn’t want to do it anymore, and then the opportunity arose
04:43
at Oregon State, when they were sending students on to summer jobs.
04:47
In those days, you had to have
04:51
2 years, as I recall, of summer work in forestry, in order to graduate.
05:00
When you were in the service, which branch of the service was that?
05:03
Marine Corps.
05:03
Marine Corps, okay.
05:06
So
05:08
you started at OSU when?
05:12
I think I started
05:17
the winter quarter of 1949.
05:22
I had been in the service one year, and then I started the winter quarter of ’49.
05:28
I went through the winter and spring quarter, then the Korean War started,
05:33
and I went back in the service again.
05:35
I got out, went back in in 1950, and I got back out in ’52.
05:44
That was the last year I worked for a fire outfit, the
05:47
Eastern Oregon Fire Patrol, and
05:50
then went back to college again.
05:53
From then on, I worked for the station [PNW] . I worked that
05:57
first year on the Andrews, which was actually called the Blue River
06:04
Experimental Forest when I started
06:07
[-] . That was the year they had the dedication and changed it to the [H.J.] Andrews.
06:14
So, you have worked continuously with PNW Station since 1953?
06:17
That’s right.
06:19
I’m just curious, your major at OSU was forestry.
06:24
Right?
06:24
Forestry, yeah, forest management.
06:26
That was the reason you went to OSU, was because they had
06:29
the forestry program there?
06:30
That’s right.
06:32
If you could, talk a little about the
06:38
people you worked with at OSU, first in the forestry program there?
06:47
At Oregon State?
06:48
That’s right.
06:50
Well, Dunn [Paul] was the dean of
06:54
the school
06:58
at the time I started.
07:03
That’d be in ’49?
07:07
Yeah, that’d be in ’49, and Walter J. McCall was
07:15
the dean afterwards, when I finally graduated.
07:22
Anybody you worked for?
07:23
I never worked with anybody.
07:26
I think Ray Yoder was my major professor, but I never really
07:30
worked with anybody on the
07:35
staff there.
07:36
The [PNW] experiment station had an office in the basement of the
07:41
forestry building [OSU] at that time.
07:42
Bob Ruth
07:46
was headquartered there, in the office, and I guess Roy Silen came later, or he
07:51
might have been there at the same time.
08:01
I’m not sure.
08:02
He was there about that time.
08:02
I talked to him.
08:02
Yeah.
08:02
So,
08:05
you were going through the program, but you weren’t working very closely with
08:07
anybody on the faculty or anything?
08:09
No, I was [laughing] just a student, hanging in there.
08:15
So, when you took the summer job, you were really taking a blind job?
08:18
You didn’t know what you were getting into?
08:18
Yeah, I had no idea what it was going to be like, or anything.
08:21
All I knew was that I wanted to get away from fire.
08:24
I didn’t want to do it anymore, and this seemed like a great job, or seemed
08:29
like a possibility of a great job.
08:32
It’s kind of hard to do, but is it possible, if you could look
08:34
back and think about what your concept was of what an experimental
08:38
forest was when you took that job.
08:39
What did you think it was all about, or
08:42
what kinds of things did you have in mind?
08:44
Well, I wish I could think of some lofty things, but I really didn’t have any.
08:48
All I knew is that I wanted to do something that related
08:53
to forest management, with the management of forests and not to
08:53
protect [fire suppression] them.
08:53
I was no longer interested in that, and also, I knew it
08:57
was something [beautiful] on
09:03
the McKenzie.
09:07
My very first job ever was on the McKenzie and I loved that place, and
09:11
I wanted to go back up there again.
09:14
That was the other thing I wanted to do.
09:17
So, the region, aspects of the landscape.
09:21
Yeah, the landscape was a big item.
09:26
Did you have any knowledge before going up there, what Roy
09:28
Silen had been doing up there?
09:30
No, I didn’t know Roy Silen.
09:32
I didn’t know anybody up there.
09:33
I hadn’t really had a lot of forestry, and I was only a sophomore.
09:40
I guess I’d finished, but not completely, my sophomore year, because
09:44
I was still in the middle of it.
09:47
I hadn’t had a lot of forestry up until then, some tree
09:49
identification and field botany.
09:55
What was your first impression in ’53 when you went down there and started working?
09:59
The first two weeks I was there it never quit raining.
10:02
[Laughter]
10:09
Roy Silen was my boss then, and the first thing that he had me do was
10:15
dig out a weir for one of the creeks where they were measuring water flow.
10:20
It may have been the very first weir that was there, I don’t
10:23
know, but that’s what I did.
10:25
I stood out there in the rain and water up to my knees, digging gravel out.
10:32
So, just a shovel and pick?
10:34
Just a shovel!
10:35
[Laughter] Yeah, I was beginning to wonder about my decision at that time.
10:43
Was there a trailer house you were living in?
10:45
No, we lived where the ranger station is now.
10:52
It was called Camp Belknap.
10:54
As I recall, it was an old 3-C [CCC] camp, and it still looked like a 3-C camp.
11:01
The real ranger station at the time was at McKenzie Bridge,
11:08
so we were upstream from there 5 or 6 miles.
11:14
I guess that is where the ranger station is now, if you know where that is.
11:17
Yeah.
11:17
But anyhow, didn’t look anything like it looks now, just those old
11:23
tarpaper, 3-C camp type places.
11:28
Actually, I had been there when I was a very small boy.
11:31
I had lived in Eugene, and my dad drove a laundry truck and delivered
11:38
laundry up to the 3-C camp.
11:40
I remember going up there, actually eating in the mess hall,
11:44
and now this, many years later,
11:46
Was that in the ‘30s sometime?
11:48
Yeah, it was about 1937, I would imagine, ’36, ’37, somewhere in that
11:57
vicinity.
11:57
And then, I ended up living in one of the regular bunkhouses
12:01
in the same old buildings.
12:01
One of the guys that lived in the bunkhouse with us was Mike
12:01
Kerrick, who later became the supervisor of that forest.
12:01
Sure, I talked to him.
12:01
He didn’t talk about living in that bunkhouse, but he mentioned
12:01
something about quarters.
12:01
Yes, he and I and 3 or 4
12:26
other guys lived there.
12:29
I was the only one who worked for the [PNW] station.
12:31
They were working for the
12:34
McKenzie Bridge Ranger District.
12:37
I remember we bought a washing machine, it was an ADC [brand] , you’d
12:44
plug it in and it would move, sort of bounce off the walls.
12:48
[Laughter]
12:50
You were the only person there besides Roy working from the station then?
12:54
Hank Gratkowski was a graduate forester with a master’s degree.
13:02
They were the two people on
13:06
the district.
13:07
And Roy was sort of the chief boss, but I really worked for both of them.
13:12
Many times I was in the field with one or the other, rarely with both of them.
13:19
Huh.
13:20
Had you met Hank Gratkowski yet?
13:21
No, I hadn’t yet.
13:24
He’s one of the early people.
13:26
I worked with Hank quite a bit and with Roy quite a bit out there.
13:32
After I dug weirs, my main job then seemed to be regeneration surveys.
13:40
We had several clear-cuts up there, and I put in these 9-acre-plots, where I’d drive
13:46
stakes in the ground, and I had, gosh, I can’t remember, probably about 40 plots
13:51
were clear-cut, and in that little acre plot, I would count every darn tree on it.
13:59
And then, because I had just taken field botany, and my botany
14:04
was pretty good, I actually did start the first botany collection.
14:09
I don’t know whatever happened to it, but I had a great large loose-leaf
14:16
notebook with plants set on it.
14:17
When
14:21
we stayed at Camp Belknap, there was a house there and one of the foresters
14:25
of the ranger district was also
14:31
sort of a botany nut.
14:33
I would bring him stuff or he would help me out, he would bring in
14:37
stuff and we’d sort of quiz each other and see if we could stump
14:39
each other with stuff we’d found.
14:41
I was pretty good at it at that time, but I’ve sort of lost all my talent.
14:47
[Chuckles]
14:48
So, you were pursuing your schoolwork there while you were working there also?
14:53
Yeah, that part was a lot of fun.
14:56
Roy Silen gave me sort of a free hand to make collections when I
15:00
was doing regeneration surveys.
15:03
Often I was out there all by myself, going up and down those hillsides.
15:09
One time, Roy forgot me, as he always picked me up at the end of the day.
15:16
We had a cookhouse then with 5 cooks and the most wonderful
15:19
food you ever had in your life.
15:20
It
15:23
was dinner time and one of the cooks said, “Roy, where’s Russ?” And he
15:25
said, “Oh God.” [Laughter] So, he had to drive out there, and it was 7 or
15:29
8 in the evening before he got me.
15:29
So, that cookhouse with 5 cooks.
15:33
Was that for everybody up there, or for just the researchers?
15:36
No, that was for everybody, everybody that was living in the
15:40
bunkhouse at the ranger station.
15:44
And we had a packer in those days, who had a string of mules and horses, and
15:51
he was there when he was not packing.
15:54
So, it sounds like you were living right there with people with the ranger station.
16:02
With the ranger station, mostly, they were summer employees.
16:06
We were all students, like Mike.
16:08
Mike was a summer employee at that time, too, and he was a senior out
16:12
of the University of Minnesota.
16:19
We also had trail crews when they came in they would stay there at the bunkhouse.
16:29
Permanent resident there, it sounds like, it was?
16:31
There was one permanent resident, who lived in a house.
16:36
There was a house there about where the ranger station office is now, as I recall.
16:42
I can’t remember what, but he lived in that house, he and
16:46
his wife and a couple of kids.
16:48
He was a forester on the district.
16:56
So, the temporary workers, sounds like there were at least 5 in the bunkhouse.
17:01
Oh yeah, there were at least 5.
17:04
It
17:07
would grow when the trail crews came in.
17:12
They would stay out 2-3 weeks at a time, and they’d just move ‘em around, and
17:18
then sometimes they’d come in for a few days, and then they’d go back out again.
17:22
Did you guys go in to Blue River at all?
17:24
Not very often, because it was downstream from where we were.
17:32
We hardly ever went down there.
17:34
I lived there a lot in 1945 when I worked there, because we
17:38
were just a mile away from them.
17:40
Actually, we were just a half, or a quarter of a mile, from them.
17:46
We swam in the river down there, and we used to have movies on
17:48
Saturday nights, movies and a dance.
17:51
We had a movie, then, everybody picked up the benches and moved
17:57
them out, and we had a dance.
17:58
[Laughing] So,
18:01
the price of the movie ticket also included the dance.
18:06
This was in town?
18:07
Yeah, this was in the town of Blue River.
18:10
I was curious, as you said you didn’t get down there much because it was
18:13
downriver, that made me wonder what kind of transportation there was out there.
18:16
You had to mostly use the river?
18:18
No, no.
18:19
You could drive down.
18:20
There was a good highway down there I used to drive.
18:23
At the time, I was going with a girl in Eugene and I used
18:28
to drive down every weekend.
18:33
So I drove back-and-forth almost every week, down to Eugene.
18:36
But for the week you’d be out there?
18:41
Yeah, I’d be out there all the time, and this is getting ahead of the story.
18:45
But somewhere in the middle of the summer, the experiment station ran out of money
18:53
[laughs], so they got me a job on the district.
18:58
Mike Kerrick and I worked together, we cruised timber way back up the
19:02
hell and gone, and then we also laid out timber sales and so forth.
19:04
Maybe
19:09
you could talk about a typical day up there in terms of hours you were working.
19:17
It sounds like you had some free time to yourself to do some of your own work?
19:20
Well, I didn’t have a lot of free time, but he [Silen] allowed me to
19:26
make these collections and so on.
19:28
In fact, Roy Silen encouraged me to make these botanical collections, because
19:34
nobody had done it up until then.
19:36
Typically, they would take me out, let me off, and I would do
19:43
regeneration surveys.
19:44
I would imagine that was more than 50 percent of my time, but
19:46
sometimes I would work with Roy.
19:52
For example, Roy and I would run P-lines.
19:54
You know what a P-line is?
19:58
It’s a preliminary line for roads.
20:00
Okay, yeah.
20:01
We’d put in P-lines that went way to the hell-and-gone, and we’d be
20:06
5 or 6 miles from the nearest road.
20:10
We’d be clear back in the back country, and at that time we only had one
20:16
main road in, and one
20:20
that crossed the river.
20:21
We had one bridge that crossed the river that ran across a little ways, but
20:28
not very far.
20:28
So, you were plotting out those routes.
20:29
Yeah, we’d plot out road routes.
20:31
That was one thing we did.
20:32
The other thing we did, is I worked with Hank Gratkowski, who
20:38
had a wind-throw study going.
20:42
I helped Hank on his wind-throw study,
20:50
taking notes, or whatever he told me to do.
20:54
Then Hank and I also laid out some of the clear-cuts, quite a few actually, and we’d
20:59
go way the heck out in the backwoods, too.
21:03
We were well in advance of the road though when laying out the clear-cuts.
21:08
I remember those very well, because Hank was really hard to please.
21:12
[Laughs] He’d lay that thing out, and then, he didn’t like it.
21:14
He’d go back and tear all the tags off, and we’d go start all over again and
21:18
lay ‘em out, and he’d say, “No, that corner’s too sharp, the wind will come
21:21
down, and blow all the trees down.” And so, we’d take it out and do it again,
21:25
and take it out and do it again, and.…
21:27
What was the size of the clear-cuts you were laying out?
21:29
I think they were mostly 30 or 40 acres, in that vicinity.
21:34
But there were some big clear-cuts.
21:35
I know the one big clear-cut that was already done when I got there,
21:43
was 1-I, I think the name of it was.
21:45
It was in the first sale they had, it was a big long
21:49
clear-cut, and was steep as hell.
21:53
When I was putting the regeneration plots on it, Hank would help me on that.
22:00
We actually let each other down on ropes in a couple places,
22:03
it was so steep, and rocky.
22:07
So, unusually long and narrow?
22:09
Yeah, it was very long and narrow.
22:12
Yeah, Roy was talking a little bit about some of the units.
22:16
I’m sure they wouldn’t have done that one, if they had it to do over again.
22:21
What was your perception of the rationale behind what was going on?
22:28
What I’m trying to get a sense of here is, what you perceived as research
22:33
opportunities there, research goals or objectives, things like that?
22:36
Well, I think one of the goals was to find out
22:41
how it affected water flow, and the other one, the other goal was to
22:44
learn how roads affected the water, and the other one was regeneration.
22:55
That’s how I spent a lot of time, counting the seedlings in plots.
23:02
The kind of work you were doing there, did it have an impact on what you decided
23:08
to do with your academic work later?
23:12
Well, it
23:17
didn’t change the direction of my life, but at the same time, I really learned
23:19
a lot, and it was helpful in my studies.
23:19
I think it was helpful later when I went into entomology,
23:19
and went to graduate school.
23:19
It was useful, just the botanical work that I did, and working in
23:19
the some of the high elevations.
23:19
The top of that forest [HJA] is pretty high [5,000 feet-plus] , and
23:19
you get up in some high elevation stuff that I’d never been in before.
23:19
So, it was educational, and I guess I used it in places, but I can’t say that it
23:19
actually changed the direction of my life.
23:20
How
24:07
long did you work down there afterwards?
24:08
I only worked on the experimental forest one year, and then, the next year, I went
24:17
into entomology.
24:19
I went into the same program where schools were giving summer jobs,
24:24
and this job in entomology came up.
24:27
I had talked to other guys about this job, and it sounded real interesting,
24:33
because, for one thing, they travelled a lot, and I wanted to do some travelling.
24:37
At the experimental forest, you stayed in the same place all the time.
24:43
I wanted to travel and see more of the state, and I didn’t mind getting
24:48
the per diem either, because at the other place you had to pay for your
24:51
own meals, although we didn’t pay much.
24:53
I think we only paid a dollar a day or so for food and lodging.
25:01
When you stayed in the CCC camp, were you paying lodging there too?
25:10
I don’t recall exactly what it was, but I think it was about a dollar a day.
25:13
Okay.
25:14
Yeah, it was a good deal.
25:19
As I say, the food was excellent.
25:20
It was just really
25:25
good.
25:25
Then, when you did regeneration surveys, it was really hard work.
25:30
You were climbing up and down, and you’re out in the sun all day.
25:34
I was young, so I could eat a lot of food.
25:38
Boy, I could eat!
25:39
First thing I did when I got home at night, was to drink a quart of milk.
25:42
I’d drink the whole quart.
25:46
[Laughs]
25:46
That reminds me of working at the dairy.
25:46
I did hay work,
25:49
we used to keep a half-gallon of milk in the fridge, and when we were
25:54
done with the haying, we’d come in and drink almost the whole thing.
25:57
[Laughter]
25:57
Yeah, I used to hay, too, when I was a kid.
25:59
I remember, you’d get awful thirsty doing that.
26:04
When you stopped working on
26:09
the Andrews, maybe you could kind of sketch out for me your subsequent
26:13
career, where you went from
26:16
there, the kinds of things you were involved in.
26:17
After the Andrews, I went to work for the entomology division
26:21
of the, what did they call it?
26:24
The division of Forest Insect Research [FIR] , I guess it was called.
26:36
The person I worked for was Ken Wright.
26:42
Right off the bat, he and I went out in the field, and we mostly
26:45
worked on the Douglas-fir bark beetle, because there was a big
26:50
outbreak of Douglas-fir bark beetles.
26:55
The head of the division was Bob Furniss,
27:00
who was as much instrumental for understanding entomology as anybody.
27:05
He and Ken Wright; I worked for them as a summer employee a couple
27:10
of years, and then, when I finally graduated, they said, you should go
27:15
to Syracuse, as everyone went there if you were in forest entomology.
27:20
So, I did too.
27:23
When did you go to Syracuse?
27:24
That would be?
27:25
That was 1956 and ’57.
27:28
I guess the academic year of ‘56/57.
27:32
So,
27:35
let’s see, you got your master’s degree there?
27:37
I got my masters, and then, while I was there,
27:44
we had a fellow
27:48
thinking of becoming a forest insect pathologist.
27:54
They had arranged coop aid for him to go to Oregon State, and at the last minute,
28:00
he decided he didn’t want to do it.
28:02
He was going to do something else.
28:03
This coop-aid money was already established, and so, Bob Furniss
28:07
asked me if I would like to take over that thing and work in entomology.
28:14
I said, “Yeah, I would.” So, I went back, and at that time, we had a new
28:19
problem called a balsam wooly aphid.
28:21
It was an introduced pest from Europe, and so they wanted me to
28:24
work on my Ph.D. studying that.
28:25
I had already worked on it in my masters back in Syracuse, so I just went on
28:34
from there, went back to Oregon State and majored in entomology.
28:38
So,
28:42
you finished up your degree when?
28:47
I got my degree in
28:51
1960.
28:51
That was a Ph.D.?
28:52
Yeah, a Ph.D. The year I was there was actually the first year Martha’s
28:56
[Brookes] husband was there.
28:59
He taught insect physiology.
29:02
I remember I took his first physiology class.
29:04
So, you
29:10
met Martha somewhere around that time?
29:14
I don’t remember when I met Martha.
29:14
Just somewhere in there.
29:15
It wasn’t when I was a student.
29:17
It was after I got my degree.
29:21
I was still working in Portland.
29:23
All the FIR people were working in Portland, and they built the
29:28
lab in Corvallis [FSL-first part] in the time that we were there.
29:33
Then, the entomology people and most of the biologists, moved out
29:37
of Portland and down to Corvallis.
29:41
I was one of the last biologists left at the Portland lab.
29:46
I came down to Corvallis in ’68.
29:50
And somewhere after that, was when I met Martha.
29:57
From
30:00
1968?
30:01
Until 1980.
30:02
And then I came over here
30:05
[Bend] , and I was here for two years.
30:09
The
30:11
accelerated research program for the spruce budworm had been going on in
30:16
Portland, and Martha was in that program.
30:18
One of the fellows who was the applications coordinator had become
30:25
ill, to the point where he couldn’t do his job anymore, so he left.
30:33
At the same time, they were thinking about closing this lab down again.
30:36
This was another time that they’d made a run, so people were searching
30:39
around looking for a job, and the director transferred me to that
30:43
job, for the person that left.
30:45
Then Martha and I were working close together for the next
30:48
two or two-and-a-half years.
30:50
Is this ‘83-’85, somewhere in there?
30:52
Yeah, about ’82 through 84.
30:58
About two-and-a-half years, I went there.
31:00
That was the same time they were trying to close the lab in Fairbanks, too, isn’t it?
31:03
I don’t remember whether Fairbanks was having a problem then or not.
31:06
They might have been, I guess.
31:09
This place [Bend] was going to be closed about three different times.
31:12
This time was finally successful.
31:13
I think you said this already, but
31:18
in 1984?
31:20
Then, after ’84, I came back to Bend, and I was in Bend until I retired in
31:31
’91.
31:32
What I want to do, is back up again, until the 1950s and 1960s.
31:38
You were coming and going from the PNW Station, doing your
31:46
graduate work.
31:46
I was curious where you were
31:50
doing your field work and who you were working with at that time, and if,
31:53
in that time, you ever went back to
31:58
the Andrews?
31:59
Yeah, I had been to the Andrews a few times after that, actually.
32:02
I tried to get a study started on the population dynamics of an
32:08
insignificant little aphid that lives
32:20
on Douglas-fir almost everywhere.
32:22
Almost every Douglas-fir has got one.
32:25
I collected data for a couple years, and then I got transferred to some
32:29
other thing and couldn’t use the data.
32:31
I’ve still got it, or still think I’ve got it.
32:35
So, you were doing some of that work on the Andrews sites?
32:39
Yeah, I did that, there was one plot I had at the Andrews, a one-acre
32:43
plot that I kept populations.
32:45
I think I did,
32:47
I would measure populations, I think, four times a year.
32:53
I went back there a number of times, but I don’t think I’ve ever been back
32:59
there since then, for any other reason.
33:04
When would that be,
33:07
when you put that plot in on the Andrews?
33:13
Oh, my guess is around 1970, 1971,
33:20
’72, something like
33:28
that.
33:28
You were taking measurements four times a year, so how long did that go on?
33:32
I did it, I think, two years, and then
33:39
I got another assignment.
33:40
For one thing, I had an assignment in Switzerland for a year, and
33:44
that sort of interfered with
33:48
my field work that I had going continuously.
33:51
And then when you came back, you started up on something else?
33:52
Yeah, started out on something else.
33:55
Maybe you could talk
33:58
about those two years of going down there, sort of infrequently, but
34:02
enough to get a sense of the place.
34:05
What’s your sense of how the place had changed from 1953 to 1971?
34:08
Oh, it had changed dramatically, because there was a lot of
34:11
roads in that hadn’t been there.
34:12
Some of those roads I’d laid out myself and P-lined, but
34:16
I had a hard time orienting
34:22
where I was, because it was all old-growth forest with,
34:28
there was some clear-cuts, but there were clear-cuts I knew, but the other
34:31
clear-cuts would disorient you when you’re used to seeing or not seeing them.
34:37
So, it was a different feeling, I guess, to get into this forest
34:42
that now had clear-cuts where it didn’t used to have them.
34:49
So, what you remembered was P-lines through old growth, but
34:51
once you got back what you saw were roads through clear-cuts?
34:57
Yeah, through old growth.
34:58
So, what’s your perception of
35:01
the kind of people involved, you were talking earlier about some
35:03
pretty close connections between the staff, or, you were doing work on
35:09
the experimental forest, and people who were with the ranger district
35:12
who were down there in the camp.
35:15
What is your perception of those kinds of things in 1970-1973?
35:17
Well, I don’t remember that there was a lot of work from the
35:25
people on the district with the site.
35:28
I don’t know
35:31
that they tolerated us, or helped us out, or anything.
35:35
I think they were generally helpful.
35:39
The ranger at the time was kind of a
35:43
[laughs] fundamentalist, I remember,
35:45
Fundamentalist in the forestry sense, or something else?
35:48
He was a fundamentalist in the religious sense.
35:53
He and his wife I guess were pretty strong Baptists or something.
35:57
I shouldn’t say Baptist, I have no idea what they were, but I remember
36:02
Roy Silen used to have a poker party.
36:05
He had a trailer.
36:06
He didn’t actually live in one of the bunkhouses.
36:09
He had a silver stream trailer he lived in, and he’d have poker parties up there.
36:15
I remember Brit Ash was the ranger at the time.
36:18
I think he said he absolutely forbid him to do that, and I think they just
36:25
ignored him and played poker anyway.
36:29
So that was Brit Ash then.
36:30
Do you know how to spell that name?
36:32
Brit was his first name,
36:36
Brit, and Ash.
36:40
Okay.
36:42
So
36:44
that was in the ‘50s?
36:46
That was when I first went there in ’53.
36:48
He was the ranger there, and he had been the ranger on that district for,
36:53
gosh, 20 years, or something like
36:58
that.
36:59
And Roy was talking about him a
37:02
little bit.
37:04
Yeah, [laughing] he was a kind of a salty old guy.
37:08
I remember when I did go work for the district, and I was
37:11
working, of course, under him.
37:16
Mike [Kerrick] and I were, I remember one place we worked in Quartz Creek,
37:21
we were cruising timber back there, and it was about 5 or 6 miles back
37:26
into that place, and when you come out, it was all downhill, there was
37:31
a lot of switchbacks, and we’d come straight across the switchbacks.
37:35
In fact, it made Brit Ash very angry, if we didn’t cut switchbacks.
37:38
[Laughs] It was, “Break down the trail,” and so forth.
37:42
What’s your recollections about Mike Kerrick in that period?
37:45
He was a student, just like I was, and he was
37:52
an outgoing, easy guy to know.
37:55
We had a lot of fun together.
37:56
He and I camped out
38:00
many evenings, many nights, in mosquito [infested] places and everything.
38:06
Had you known him before you went down there?
38:07
No, I hadn’t known him at all, you know, he was a student from, as
38:10
I say, I think it was Minnesota.
38:12
I’m not real sure.
38:14
Yeah, I think that’s right.
38:16
Yeah, and he was a senior, I was a sophomore, so he was the natural leader.
38:19
I did what he told me to do.
38:25
He had worked for that district in summers before.
38:31
In fact, he said he did some fire work before.
38:32
Did you guys talk at all about your fire work?
38:35
Because you’d done some of that yourself?
38:36
I can’t remember that we talked about that.
38:41
I don’t recall that.
38:43
We had some interesting places, in fact, that one place I mentioned
38:47
that we cruised where we camped out.
38:50
It was the most magnificent camp you ever saw.
38:53
It was just like a cathedral, these huge Douglas-firs, and a creek running through
38:58
it, and nothing growing underneath it.
39:00
It was so dark under there, you know, it was a magnificent camp.
39:04
But the mosquitos would practically eat you alive.
39:09
Then another place, where you had to cross the Blue River on a log.
39:14
I remember going up to a place called Tidbits Creek, and we put out a
39:19
timber sale up there, Mike and I.
39:25
I guess the timber had been laid out, and we were mapping it in.
39:31
And ran a compass line around there.
39:35
Yeah, somebody had laid it out with string, and there’s a guy
39:39
named Corson Williams, who was the
39:43
sort of engineer there.
39:45
He laid it out, and then Mike and I came in and
39:50
stapled tags on all the trees that we went around to make it more permanent.
39:54
And we also mapped it with a compass.
40:00
And that was a hell of a place to get in and out of.
40:02
I mean, there was huge, big rocks in there and no trails, just cross country.
40:07
We had a guy that come in with us, his name was Al Weiner.
40:11
I’ll never forget Al.
40:14
He was coming in there to help us work, and we told him that he had to
40:18
leave by 3 o’clock, or he’d never get down to the river before it got dark.
40:23
So,
40:27
he didn’t make it, and he had to cross this river on a log.
40:33
It was a roaring river, and you didn’t want to do it in the
40:35
dark, because you could hear that thing right when you’d get there.
40:39
So he didn’t make it, so he ended up spending the whole
40:41
night camped over there.
40:42
Corson Williams, who was sort of our boss, told us, we’re not gonna wait for him.
40:48
We did wait for dark, and when it was pitch dark, we had a hell
40:50
of a time getting out of there.
40:52
Because you couldn’t see anything.
40:54
It was under old-growth and everything walking down this trail.
40:59
So, he spent the whole night on that river, he didn’t smoke,
41:03
so he didn’t have any matches.
41:05
Oh
41:09
jeez.
41:09
That would be a good reason to take up smoking, I
41:13
guess.
41:13
How far up was that?
41:15
Well, you went up like you were going into Andrews, and then there was a trail
41:19
that went off before you got up there, and you crossed the river, and then went up.
41:26
I’d have to look at a map.
41:27
I can’t even remember which the direction is, but I remember you had
41:29
to cross Blue River on this log, and then just take off cross-country.
41:37
Did you ever encounter any problems with wildlife?
41:42
No, I never did.
41:44
Mosquitos, but that was just one of those things you had to put up with.
41:48
Hmm.
41:49
Jerry Franklin told a story about
41:52
how he would push himself, when he first started working out there,
41:54
he’d push himself to go out into the woods farther and farther each time,
41:59
until he felt comfortable out there.
42:00
Now you grew up around Tillamook area?
42:01
Yeah, I was raised in the woods.
42:04
I’m surprised at Jerry Franklin, he was raised in Waldport or
42:07
Reedsport, or someplace down there.
42:08
Camas, I think, or maybe not.
42:12
[Camas, Washington/Columbia River east of Vancouver]
42:13
. Anyhow, I’d lived almost all of my life in the woods, so it just seems natural.
42:18
It never occurred to me to be concerned.
42:23
[Chuckles]
42:23
Aside from other people holding you back until after dark, were
42:27
there ever any problems there?
42:27
No,
42:30
it didn’t bother me any, you know, we had a trail to go out, and the
42:34
only problem was finding the trail.
42:39
We had this dog, Tippy, who was pretty good, if you could keep ahold of Tippy.
42:44
That belonged to Corson Williams.
42:46
Whose dog was that?
42:47
That was Corson Williams’ dog, Tippy all went in it.
42:49
The first thing that Tippy did in the morning was give you a stick,
42:53
and if you were dumb enough to pick up that stick and throw it, you
42:55
had Tippy for the rest of the day.
42:57
[Laughter]
42:57
What kind of dog was that?
43:00
Oh, sort of a mixture, it looked like mostly a border collie or something.
43:09
Another funny story with Tippy was, at this one place up Quartz
43:13
Creek, where Mike and I had camped.
43:19
The packer would bring us food in.
43:22
Well, we didn’t tell him what, he just sort of brought food.
43:25
I don’t know how it evolved, but anyhow, we always had lots of Spam,
43:30
neither Mike nor I would eat it, and it just sort of accumulated.
43:34
He’d always bring another load the next week.
43:37
[Laughs] So, Al Weiner and I remember somebody else in the [forest] supervisor’s
43:42
office would come up there to … I don’t know why they were up there.
43:47
I think they were just out seeing what was going on in the woods.
43:51
Anyhow, they stayed with us one night.
43:54
Al Wiener saw the Spam, and was going to show us some new way he was going to treat
43:59
it that would make it more palatable.
44:02
He was cutting it up, I remember.
44:09
There was a stump, he’d throw it [Spam] on the stump, he’d cut another [piece] and
44:10
Tippy would go ‘oomph,’ he’d cut another, and Tippy would go ‘oomph’ [laughter].
44:15
He [Tippy] ate a whole can of that, and Mike and I were just sitting
44:19
there watching Tippy eat this.
44:25
[Laughter]
44:25
So, Al wasn’t aware the dog was eating it?
44:26
No, he wasn’t aware of it.
44:26
[Laughter] And he turned around and saw that, and he started
44:28
throwing rocks at poor old Tippy.
44:31
You could see Tippy standing around the edge of the camp all
44:33
night, as we had a fire in there.
44:34
[Laughter]
44:35
That’s probably the best use of Spam I ever heard.
44:38
[Laughter]
44:43
If you kind of compare those experiences to the time you came back and the kind of
44:49
field work you were doing in ’71 and ’72,
44:55
how accessible were the sites you were working on, how did you get there?
44:56
Well, the place I was working on
45:00
was in Sale #2, as I recall, and that sale had just started when I was there.
45:06
I actually took regeneration surveys [in the 1950s] , so then when I came
45:09
back there the trees were, oh, 4 to 5 feet tall, and I knew that was what
45:16
size trees I wanted, because I wanted to stay with them a few years as they grew.
45:16
So, the place I picked was right alongside the road, I wanted one that
45:17
was easily accessible and that was fairly flat, and so that’s where I
45:17
took it right beside the road and right beside these trees and everything.
45:17
I think you said this earlier, but what size plot were you working with
45:23
there?
45:23
It
45:39
was about an acre.
45:40
And I remember, as I recall, I took
45:45
samples from 50 trees per acre.
45:50
Let’s see now, you were in Bend, but now, were you in the
45:53
Corvallis Lab at this time?
45:54
Yeah, I was in Corvallis.
45:55
So, when you went down there to work, did you
45:59
go down there overnight?
46:01
No, we used to go down, we’d get up real early in the morning, drive down
46:06
there, and then come home the same day.
46:10
And at the time, we didn’t have a lot of operational money.
46:16
Were there facilities there at that time, if you’d wanted to stay?
46:18
No, there were no facilities there.
46:19
I was surprised to find out from Martha that there are facilities now.
46:23
I haven’t been there since then [early 1970s] . There were no
46:25
facilities any time I was there.
46:29
Of any kind out there.
46:30
There was nothing out there.
46:32
[1st- maintenance structure, early 1970s]
46:32
You should go visit it, it’s pretty interesting now.
46:33
Is that right?
46:34
It’s like a hotel there.
46:37
So, when you went there, you’d basically pack in whatever you
46:41
needed to survive for that day?
46:42
Yeah, you could drive right to the plot I was going to.
46:46
And when I was first there too,
46:50
there were graduate students that had a tent down by the river.
46:55
That was Harry [Howard] Horton [one of the graduate students] . I don’t
46:55
know if you’ve met Harry Horton?
46:56
No.
46:58
He was a graduate student who was working on the fish population on Lookout Creek.
47:06
He was working on,
47:10
I don’t know if it was his Ph.D. or his masters.
47:12
At OSU in fisheries?
47:14
Huh?
47:14
At OSU, was he in the fisheries program?
47:15
Yeah, he was at OSU,
47:20
a graduate student in their program, and he later became part of the faculty.
47:24
I think he may still be on the faculty.
47:29
Or, he may be retired, but I think he still lives in Corvallis.
47:33
Martha knows him.
47:38
So he was doing research there for a while?
47:40
Yeah, he was doing research on the fish population on Lookout Creek.
47:46
I helped him one time, and I gather that other people, Roy
47:50
and Hank, helped him other times.
47:52
We’d be dragging a net up Lookout Creek, we’d all get in the creek, and drag
47:58
this net up the creek, and net the fish out of a certain little stretch of the
48:03
stream, just to count the population.
48:05
Do you recall much about the fish population.
48:09
High, low, or
48:10
--? No, I can’t tell you.
48:14
I know I always envied Howard, because he could go out and
48:18
he had a collector’s permit.
48:19
He could fish anytime he wanted to.
48:21
[Laughter]
48:21
So, did you do fishing up there?
48:25
I fished right across the river from Belknap Camp.
48:28
This is on the McKenzie River.
48:29
You just went about, oh, 50 yards through the brush [to river] . I had never fished,
48:36
really much, until then, and Roy Silen taught me how to roll-cast with flies,
48:41
so I used to go over there and fly fish.
48:44
You know, I used to catch quite a few fish out of there.
48:47
I think this was before Al Levno was up there.
48:51
Did you run across him up there?
48:53
Al wasn’t there then, no.
48:56
I know Al Levno, but I didn’t really know him until after this.
48:59
How did you come to know him?
49:00
Well, when we were both at Corvallis.
49:05
Okay.
49:07
So, this was after
49:13
you were up there.
49:15
Did you ever talk about it with him when you were up there?
49:15
I must have, but I don’t recall our conversations.
49:18
It seems like we ought to have talked about it.
49:20
It wasn’t like a central characteristic of your – [work]
49:24
No, there wasn’t any reason to talk about it.
49:26
I want to get
49:31
back to this point that we started out with; some of the differences
49:34
between the 1950s and the 1970s.
49:37
It didn’t sound like there were
49:43
too many other researchers up there, like you had earlier in the 1950s.
49:47
It was rare, apparently, to run across someone working
49:49
up there, like Harry Horton.
49:51
Is that right?
49:53
I can’t remember.
49:54
Bob Tarrant worked up there when I was first there.
49:58
At least, I saw him up there one time.
50:02
He was the soils guy, and later become one of the directors of the station
50:07
[PNW] . But I had no idea what he was doing, and he wasn’t there very long.
50:13
It sounds like whenever you ran across someone up there, it was kind of an event.
50:17
Yeah, they would sort of come in to look around or something,
50:20
and then they were gone again.
50:23
I remember Leo Isaacs was there too, and I remember that very well, because Leo
50:27
Isaacs was sort of the guru of the first silviculture [major player, 1st half of
50:31
20th Century in Pacific Northwest forest
50:35
science] . I mean, when I was in school, that’s all they ever
50:37
talked about, was Leo Isaacs.
50:40
I mean, that was a great man.
50:41
Actually, I rode in a car with him.
50:43
I thought that was something.
50:45
So, he was just up there on a tour?
50:47
I think so.
50:48
I remember there was quite a few people in the car, and I don’t remember
50:51
any other people other than him.
50:52
I guess I was so enamored that I’d get to meet the great man.
50:57
So, did he make an impression on you?
51:00
Yeah, he seemed a real kindly old man.
51:02
I
51:05
remember him talking to everybody, and people were always asking him
51:09
questions, and the very slow and considerate way that he talked.
51:16
I thought, “Gosh, this guy, he really does know a lot.”
51:21
So, that was when you were just an undergraduate student?
51:23
Yeah, I was just a sophomore, so what do I know?
51:27
[Laughter]
51:28
Can you recall anything like that from the ‘70s?
51:34
No, I rarely ran into anybody when I was working up there.
51:41
And I don’t even know that there was anybody
51:45
really in charge of the forest that you told when you were working there.
51:49
You just sort of did your work, and since I was working on a plot nobody would be
51:55
the least bit interested in, I just think
52:00
there wouldn’t be anybody else working on top of me.
52:05
I’m not sure I even told
52:09
anybody that I was working there.
52:10
There wasn’t anybody that you could tell, that I recall.
52:12
So, you didn’t really interact with any staff down there or anything?
52:16
No, no.
52:18
There were no facilities on the forest, and I can’t remember that
52:22
there was anybody who was there [on-site, U.S. Forest Service] . There
52:25
used to be a technician I remember, and I guess maybe that was Al.
52:29
Probably Al [Levno]
52:32
. And I may have talked to Al. Maybe Al and I knew I was up there, but that was
52:43
about it.
52:44
Where did you encounter people when you went up there, if it wasn’t on
52:47
the Andrews?
52:48
Did you run into people in the Blue River district?
52:50
Al, I knew, of course, from the lab in Corvallis, but I never
52:55
did run into anybody up there.
52:58
There was no place up there for them to be, other than there was the ranger
53:03
station at Blue River, and I think maybe Mike [Kerrick] was the ranger there then.
53:09
Yeah, I think that’s right.
53:14
Did you have any interaction with people at the ranger station?
53:18
No, I didn’t.
53:18
I think I may have stopped to see Mike, but just a friendly, social thing.
53:26
Do you recall going to Blue River at all in that period?
53:31
In the town of Blue River?
53:32
Yeah, in Blue River?
53:34
Maybe stopped for a cup of coffee or something.
53:37
I’m just trying to get a sense of how the community changed.
53:39
Oh, Blue River hasn’t changed a heck of a lot.
53:43
[Laughter] From 1945, that’s when I first knew it, it’s pretty much the same.
53:51
Very little change.
53:53
I remember when I was there in ’45 there was a big flap about somebody
53:57
wanting to put in a trolley for a diner.
54:01
There was no place to eat in that place, so that was a big flap.
54:08
Since then it has changed very little, other than there is a road that bypasses
54:13
[the town] . The road used to go through the middle of Blue River, of course.
54:17
Went by the high school,
54:20
and down past Sparks Ranch.
54:22
In 1945 it was just a little quarter of a mile there, and Sparks ranch had been
54:28
a famous roadhouse, or something, in its day, going back into the ‘20s, I think.
54:36
Mrs. Sparks had home-cooked food, and when you got there at dinner time,
54:46
everybody ate at the same table.
54:47
We ate at the same table all the time, with a bunch of engineers.
54:48
So, you guys went there, that in the 1940s, when you worked there as
54:56
a student?
54:56
Well, I was just 15 years old then.
54:59
I was still in high school.
55:02
So this was in 1945?
55:03
Yeah, that was in 1945, when I was in Sparks Ranch.
55:07
Sparks Ranch was still there when I was
55:14
there in ’53, but I don’t think it was serving as a boarding house
55:17
anymore, and I think Mrs. Sparks had died, and she was the guiding force.
55:24
You
55:27
mentioned earlier you might have stopped in occasionally for coffee.
55:32
Where would that be?
55:34
Well, just about the same place that diner was at, I think.
55:37
It was right in Blue River.
55:40
That’s the only time I stopped there.
55:43
Some other people mentioned there was a bar in town where people stopped
55:43
for drinks after work up there?
55:43
Yeah, there was a bar,
55:47
but I never did go there at the time for drinking.
55:51
I remember there used to be a place that had topless dancers
55:56
[the Cougar Room] , or something.
55:56
That was really quite a change from the old days.
55:59
That was about the only significant change, I think, in Blue River.
56:02
Otherwise, as I say, Blue River didn’t look a lot different.
56:06
In fact, there was a fly-tying shop that was there in later years.
56:14
That was there when I was first up there as a kid, a 15-year-old kid.
56:17
Can
56:21
you recall, from when you were there in the ‘50s, did the people of Blue River
56:26
have any sense of what the forest up
56:30
there was, the experimental forest?
56:30
Do you have any sense of that?
56:30
I doubt it.
56:31
I doubt they knew of the experimental forest unless they happened to
56:35
work up there for a logging crew.
56:41
The logger that logged it was named Mike Savelich.
56:44
He was from Eugene, and I don’t really know where all his people came from.
56:50
[Laughs] Some of them were relatives.
56:52
He was from Yugoslavia [Croatian heritage] , and he brought a whole bunch of people up
56:58
there
57:03
when I was there who couldn’t even speak English.
57:03
Mike Kerrick was telling me he hired a lot of Croatians.
57:05
This would explain why.
57:05
They were his relatives?
57:06
They were his relatives, yeah.
57:06
[Laughs] I think they were all his kinfolk, you know.
57:10
And they spoke in Croatian?
57:15
I think so.
57:17
I had tried to talk to them, and I wasn’t getting anywhere.
57:23
I remember though, he was putting culverts in, and culverts were really expensive.
57:29
I didn’t realize that until I worked up there.
57:31
It’s a piece of tin; couldn’t be expensive.
57:35
They’d make these culverts as short as possible, and his relatives from Croatia,
57:44
or wherever they were from in Yugoslavia, built rocks around them, so he had nice
57:49
rock works around the end of the culverts.
57:52
I thought we had the nicest looking culverts of anybody in the
57:57
forest.
57:58
I imagine the rocks are still there.
58:01
There was nice rock work all around it.
58:06
Art McKee, I think told me [story about culverts] . Do you recall if Roy Silen
58:11
had an interest in that, as possibly [help in] solving problems with roads?
58:15
[Road washouts, erosion, runoff, etc.]
58:15
Yeah, he was interested in that.
58:18
I remember him talking about
58:21
doing measures to reduce the flow of the erosion around
58:28
culverts and stuff like that.
58:30
Your recollection of Mike Savelich and his crew, was that Roy
58:34
Silen suggested they do that?
58:36
Well, it may have been a cooperative thing.
58:40
I have no idea how that come about.
58:44
But I remember Roy talking about it, and I remember seeing these guys do it.
58:47
Did you have much interaction with Mike Savelich yourself?
58:52
No, I didn’t.
58:53
I had met him, but he didn’t talk much to a sophomore.
58:59
But I do
59:02
remember more than once, he would say things like, “Now there’s a good tree
59:06
there,” or, “It’s gonna fall down,”
59:12
or “Why don’t we take that tree out.” And Hank Gratkowski would never
59:15
let him have the tree he wanted.
59:17
He would never give in: “No, that tree is gonna stay!” [Laughs] Hank was a
59:24
very intense guy. When you meet him,
59:27
you’ll see, he was so different than Roy.
59:32
There was a lot of conflict, really, between those two, because
59:36
they worked so differently.
59:38
I mean, two different personalities entirely, and Hank, I think
59:43
knew what he was going to do
59:51
to-
59:51
Sorry, you were talking about?
59:53
Well, as I said, Hank was a very intense guy.
59:55
He was very organized, he knew exactly what he was going to
1:00:00
do, and he had everything lined up and it had to go that way.
1:00:05
If it didn’t, he’d get very upset.
1:00:08
Well, Roy had a big broad plan, maybe for this week, or maybe for this
1:00:16
month, or maybe just for this year, I’m not sure, but when you went out
1:00:19
for work in the morning, he wasn’t always sure what he was going to do.
1:00:25
[Laughter] That’s the way Roy worked.
1:00:28
He could carry all this stuff in his mind, and
1:00:34
he appeared to be disorganized.
1:00:36
I really respected Roy, because he was really a sharp guy, but
1:00:41
Roy, that’s the way he worked.
1:00:44
And Roy also thought about everything, I mean everything.
1:00:47
There was nothing that he wouldn’t think about.
1:00:50
He’d have some plan about, it would be forestry, or it would
1:00:54
be world politics, or anything.
1:00:57
He’d expound upon it, and it just used to drive Hank crazy.
1:01:01
[Laughter]
1:01:03
So, Hank was much more detail-oriented than Roy?
1:01:05
Yeah.
1:01:07
That could be a good mix, where you’d have one person who was kind
1:01:09
of a broad thinker, and the other one was kind of a detail man.
1:01:12
But you said they had conflicts?
1:01:12
Yeah,
1:01:17
I think it bothered Hank more than it bothered Roy.
1:01:18
I don’t know if it bothered Roy.
1:01:21
I mean, he’s so easy-going of a guy.
1:01:25
It shouldn’t have bothered him particularly, but it used to bother Hank.
1:01:28
I knew it bothered Hank, because he would occasionally sit down and start griping
1:01:33
at me, and I had dinner with Hank a few times, and was friends with his family.
1:01:39
He lived right in McKenzie Bridge.
1:01:43
He had a house there, and a good family, so I had dinner with him a few times.
1:01:50
He was an old-fashioned, old-world kind of a guy, in his family relationships.
1:02:01
He made all the decisions.
1:02:02
[Laughs]
1:02:04
I mean, his wife couldn’t buy groceries unless he told her what to buy.
1:02:13
He’s still around, isn’t he?
1:02:15
The last time I knew, he lived in Roseburg.
1:02:20
Do you have any contact with him anymore?
1:02:24
No, I haven’t had any contact with Hank for a long time.
1:02:25
Not since he worked for a while in Corvallis, and that
1:02:29
was the last time I knew him.
1:02:31
So, you re-connected with him later when you started working in Corvallis?
1:02:36
Yeah, I got slightly connected with him, but not very seriously, and I never
1:02:42
really did get close to him after that
1:02:49
early Andrews experience.
1:02:49
We had some good times, and we worked a long ways out in the woods.
1:02:55
[Laughs] One place we worked out in the woods was by the river,
1:02:58
and we were sitting having lunch.
1:02:59
So, he was pushing rocks down the hill, watching them roll down the hill.
1:03:04
There was a Douglas-fir sapling stand way down the hill, I don’t know exactly
1:03:08
where, but I’d been there one time, but it was all Douglas-fir saplings.
1:03:12
These rocks rolled through and skinned up a whole bunch of trees.
1:03:12
Roy Silen went out there about 2 or 3 weeks later, and he said,
1:03:13
[laughing], “Some sons-of-a-bitches, you know, rolled rocks
1:03:22
down
1:03:26
there.” Hank and I were just sitting there, saying, “Wonder
1:03:28
who would have done that?”
1:03:34
[Laughing]
1:03:35
Was Roy incensed about that?
1:03:37
Yeah, he was really unhappy about that.
1:03:40
I mean, he was really mad that somebody would go scarring up
1:03:43
those trees with these damn rocks.
1:03:45
Wow, when we were rolling them rocks, we hadn’t been thinking
1:03:47
about those trees down there.
1:03:48
Sure.
1:03:52
You mentioned that Roy was always thinking about things to do.
1:03:56
What’s your recollection about his perception of that experimental
1:04:00
forest and what its purpose was?
1:04:02
Well, I remember, he was very excited about it.
1:04:06
I remember him saying, “Here’s an opportunity.
1:04:10
I get to open up a forest all by myself and have it planned out the way
1:04:14
I want it to be done.” He was really excited about that kind of work,
1:04:21
and what it would turn out to be.
1:04:21
I remember, I was so
1:04:30
surprised in later years, when he said he was going into genetics, and
1:04:35
completely retooling, essentially.
1:04:37
He was going back to school in genetics and so forth, and
1:04:41
getting away from that forest.
1:04:42
I thought that forest would be his life.
1:04:47
But he wasn’t really there very long.
1:04:49
I don’t know how long he was there.
1:04:50
I don’t know how long he [Roy Silen] was there.
1:04:50
He left the year after you were there.
1:04:51
Yeah, he was there from ’48 to ’54, and he mentioned that it was put
1:04:55
under the control of the forest supervisor in ’54, ’55, and he didn’t
1:05:02
ever have the heart to go back there.
1:05:05
So, it sounds like you were saying, he took a very personal stake?
1:05:07
Yeah, he really was like that.
1:05:09
I don’t know if the supervisor at that time was a guy named
1:05:12
Bruckart [John D. Bruckart] , or Buckner, something like that.
1:05:14
He was a hard-nosed son-of-a-bitch, and I think there was some animosity between
1:05:21
the experimental forest and Bruckart.
1:05:28
You can’t recall what it was about?
1:05:30
I can’t remember his reasons, because I was just on the periphery,
1:05:33
listening in on the conversations.
1:05:37
You mentioned earlier that Roy had conflicts because of his poker games,
1:05:44
something that cropped up with Brit Ash.
1:05:47
Was this the same kind of thing, or was this something different?
1:05:52
No, that was different.
1:05:54
I sort of got the feeling the thing with Buckner [Bruckart]
1:05:59
, or whatever his name was, was about land management and how
1:06:04
they were doing it, and was
1:06:09
maybe about even timber sales.
1:06:10
I’ve got no idea
1:06:14
how that comes out.
1:06:15
Now, you had a lot of
1:06:19
work experience at that time,
1:06:22
which was laying out roads and things, but you’d been around a lot of forests.
1:06:25
I hadn’t been around a lot of forests, but
1:06:31
I had worked in the forest, in fire protection up until that
1:06:35
year, but I’d never done anything in management in this area.
1:06:39
It was all pretty new to me.
1:06:41
The engineering part, the p-lines, and so forth.
1:06:44
I’d already had the first year of engineering [training] , so I knew how
1:06:49
to throw a chain and put out a compass,
1:06:58
simple things like that.
1:06:58
I was wondering if anything struck you at that time as unusual, the way the
1:07:02
roads were being put in, or about the streams and different things with water?
1:07:07
[Water runoff, turbidity, erosion, etc.]
1:07:07
I had no preconceptions, since I’d never put in a road before.
1:07:13
The only thing I remember in engineering is they said no roads should be more
1:07:18
than 6 percent [grade] , and when we got out there, we actually put some grades
1:07:23
in that were steeper than 6 percent.
1:07:27
I remember, Roy said, “The reason for that is that we’ve got to keep
1:07:32
our road distance down as much as possible, and if it means running a
1:07:37
little at 8 percent or something like that, well, we’re going to do it.
1:07:41
The loggers will complain about it, or they’ll complain a little, but still,
1:07:45
they’ll log it anyway, and they’ll haul it anyway.” And that was it, because
1:07:52
I remember when I did work for Corson Williams later in the year, we put in
1:07:56
some roads there too, and, gosh darn, we stayed under 6 percent, and it was
1:08:03
a real chore to do that sometimes.
1:08:06
We put in a p-line that must have been 2 miles long, and had to take it all
1:08:10
out again, because we’d got ourselves in a corner and couldn’t get out
1:08:15
of it without going over 6 percent.
1:08:20
[Laughs] So, we put in a whole bunch more road so we could
1:08:25
stay in the 6 percent rule.
1:08:29
That’s interesting that Roy was waiving those rules.
1:08:31
Yeah, he was essentially waiving those rules.
1:08:34
I don’t know if he was permitted to do that, or not, but he did that.
1:08:39
You said that he made you keep the roads down, but you mean the mileage?
1:08:44
Yes.
1:08:44
He [Silen] wanted to keep the number of linear miles of road to the absolute
1:08:50
minimum for logging and access, because I guess they knew even then that roads
1:09:00
were the source of a lot of erosion
1:09:14
from logging.
1:09:16
You were talking earlier about his conflict with [Bruckart] , or
1:09:16
whatever his name was.
1:09:18
I wonder if this would have been one of the points of controversy.
1:09:21
Did they keep fighting over it?
1:09:24
I don’t have the slightest idea.
1:09:26
It sounds like Mike Savelich would be the guy that would have to deal with
1:09:30
it.
1:09:30
[Laughter]
1:09:31
Mike, as I understand, was not the primary contractor.
1:09:34
I think he was the subcontractor.
1:09:36
Somebody with more money was ahead of him.
1:09:41
You want to check that with Roy.
1:09:43
He would certainly know much better than I would, but that was my
1:09:46
impression, that there was somebody
1:09:50
else.
1:09:50
[Who held contracts, posted bonds, etc.]
1:09:50
He talked about Mike Savelich, but he didn’t mention he was a subcontractor,
1:09:54
but I didn’t ask him that question.
1:09:56
Nobody else worked there.
1:09:57
He essentially did everything by himself.
1:10:02
But, I still think there was somebody else backing him, that had more money
1:10:08
and could post bonds and all that stuff.
1:10:15
I already asked you whether you were involved with Mike at all.
1:10:18
Were you around at all, or was there much road construction going
1:10:21
on when you were there, or were you just running the lines out?
1:10:26
You mentioned there was just the one road in there.
1:10:28
There was the road that went all the way up to 1 and 2 [HJA
1:10:31
experimental watersheds] , then, there was a road that went across
1:10:33
the creek, but it didn’t go very far.
1:10:37
I cannot remember a road construction [project] , but there must have been.
1:10:42
Maybe not that year.
1:10:43
Maybe that year there wasn’t any.
1:10:45
I don’t know.
1:10:46
I just don’t remember any at all.
1:10:49
I remember Mike worked out there, and the crew.
1:10:53
And I think it was part of Mike’s equipment, too,
1:10:57
used before the dedication.
1:11:00
They had to clean out someplace in the lower part of the watershed [for
1:11:04
dedication ceremony] , and the forest [Willamette NF] was involved in that.
1:11:07
I remember there were people from the forest in on that, the dedication,
1:11:11
cleaning up for that, and putting in that big rock with the plaque.
1:11:15
[Constructed in]
1:11:16
Yeah, you were there.
1:11:18
I was there the day of the renaming.
1:11:21
I remember I had a pickup full of water that I had to put in
1:11:26
peoples’ cars that would overheat.
1:11:27
They went all the way to the top [main road at that time] for some reason.
1:11:31
I can’t remember why, but there were some speeches up there.
1:11:36
People were driving their individual cars, they’d drive clear up
1:11:39
there, and I was providing water in case anybody overheated.
1:11:43
I can’t remember if anybody did overheat.
1:11:47
Then, they came back down and had a talk down there.
1:11:52
I remember Mrs. Andrews, who was there, and she said
1:12:01
something.
1:12:01
I’ve got to talk to her too, because I’ve got a friend says she still
1:12:05
lives in Corvallis, and she would be willing to be interviewed for that.
1:12:07
Oh, does she live in Corvallis?
1:12:09
Yes, but I haven’t met her yet.
1:12:09
What’s her name?
1:12:09
Virginia?
1:12:09
[Willien was widow of H.J. Andrews, Virginia, daughter of Andrews,
1:12:12
Carolyn, his grand-daughter.
1:12:13
All were present at event]
1:12:15
. I can’t remember.
1:12:16
I just remember she was there and talked.
1:12:18
Did she talk
1:12:23
about her husband, do you remember?
1:12:26
I can’t remember.
1:12:29
You said they went up to the top.
1:12:32
Was that up to Carpenter Lookout?
1:12:34
No, you couldn’t even get close to that.
1:12:39
It was a place called unit 1-I, and that’s where everybody had to go to
1:12:42
get a sort of a distant view, the best view you could get [at that time]
1:12:45
. Okay.
1:12:47
That was pretty high up, by the clear-cut that was so long and steep.
1:12:55
You know that Hank and I, rolled [chuckling], those
1:12:59
big things you put cables on?
1:13:03
Those big reels?
1:13:05
We rolled one of those things off of
1:13:08
that
1:13:13
thing.
1:13:13
[Laughter] It must of went 50 feet, or maybe even 100 feet
1:13:15
in the air, down at the bottom.
1:13:15
It just popped out of there, popped clear out of the damn trees.
1:13:19
[Laughing]
1:13:19
Oh, jeez.
1:13:19
I guess you never told that one to Roy, eh?
1:13:19
[Laughter]
1:13:19
No, we never told Roy about that one either.
1:13:23
[Laughter] Yeah, that was fun though to watch it
1:13:33
go.
1:13:33
It took huge leaps when it went down.
1:13:34
So, Hank was with you on that one?
1:13:37
Yeah.
1:13:40
Sounds like you had good times with each other.
1:13:42
[Laughter]
1:13:44
Yeah, he was serious in some respects, and in other places,
1:13:47
he was young as a kid, I guess.
1:13:53
I’m curious about Roy’s reputation for poker games.
1:13:57
Did you go out there and do that at all when you were there?
1:13:59
No, I wasn’t involved [in his games] . I was too young.
1:14:05
I knew he had ‘em, and I knew that Brit Ash disapproved of them,
1:14:10
and his wife,
1:14:13
too.
1:14:13
She was sort of the leader of the McKenzie Bridge society up there.
1:14:20
Mrs. Ash?
1:14:21
Mrs. Ash, yeah.
1:14:22
Roy wasn’t married then.
1:14:24
He didn’t get married
1:14:28
until sometime later.
1:14:29
In fact, there is one of those stories you’ve probably heard about.
1:14:34
In those days, we used to get paid in, your paychecks were really IBM
1:14:38
cards, you know, the punch cards?
1:14:40
Oh yeah.
1:14:41
You weren’t supposed to spindle or fold them, or anything like that?
1:14:45
Well, Roy had spent a lot of time up there, and we ate in the mess
1:14:50
hall, so he didn’t really have a lot of reason to spend his money.
1:14:54
The checks sort of accumulated, he wrapped them up in this rubber band,
1:14:58
and he had them in this trailer house.
1:14:59
And as I remember, and the mice got in there and apparently
1:15:02
ate holes into his paychecks.
1:15:08
[Laughing] Sort of screwed up the accounting system.
1:15:12
So, he’s famous, I guess, for not spending money?
1:15:16
I’m kind of curious here about what you mentioned of the McKenzie Bridge society.
1:15:19
This would be a social circle up
1:15:24
there of people that were residents in the area?
1:15:27
Yeah.
1:15:27
I think so.
1:15:29
That’s just what Hank told me.
1:15:30
Hank lived in McKenzie Bridge, so he knew about it, and we would be more
1:15:36
cynical about them than they deserved.
1:15:39
[Laughing] I really had no idea.
1:15:42
Hank Gratkowski
1:15:47
was up there.
1:15:48
How long was he up there?
1:15:50
Do you know?
1:15:50
No, I don’t really know.
1:15:52
I think he came right out of school, right out of his master’s degree.
1:15:56
I think he got his masters at Harvard or Yale, one of those places, maybe Yale.
1:16:04
And I don’t know how long he stayed
1:16:10
after Roy left.
1:16:13
I think he went to Roseburg after that and worked down there.
1:16:20
He started working on brush control, I
1:16:25
knew that was his thing.
1:16:25
Maybe he left the same time Hank did, I mean, that Roy did.
1:16:28
Roy switched to genetics, and Hank switched to herbicide work.
1:16:36
They were both [PNW] station employees, weren’t they?
1:16:39
Yeah, they were both station employees.
1:16:40
But there was a lab, we had a research center or something
1:16:43
in Roseburg for a while,
1:16:48
and that’s where he went.
1:16:48
You told me this already, but Hank had a house there and was he married?
1:16:54
Yes, he was married and had two children.
1:16:56
He had a boy and a girl.
1:16:56
Both preschoolers at the time, as I recall.
1:16:56
So,
1:17:05
he was essentially looking from outside at McKenzie Bridge society?
1:17:09
Yeah, he’d just moved there, hadn’t been there very long.
1:17:13
He was from Pennsylvania.
1:17:14
I think it was probably the first time he’d ever been in the Northwest.
1:17:15
Isn’t that where Fred Swanson’s from?
1:17:16
[Pennsylvania]
1:17:16
Is
1:17:29
that right?
1:17:30
I think I’ve got that right.
1:17:33
I remember Hank talking about, if they were going to give the world
1:17:37
an enema, they’d give it in Scranton [Pennsylvania] . [Laughter] He
1:17:43
wasn’t sorry to leave that place at
1:17:48
all.
1:17:48
It sounds like you spent most of your time with Hank.
1:17:50
Yeah, I probably spent most of my time with Hank.
1:17:54
Far more than with Roy, but
1:17:58
I remember doing p-lines with Roy, and
1:18:04
I remember doing that more than anything.
1:18:08
Gosh, he’s hard to keep up with in the woods [Roy Silen] . That
1:18:09
guy just goes like crazy.
1:18:12
Which one?
1:18:12
Roy does.
1:18:13
Roy.
1:18:13
Is that right?
1:18:14
Yeah, [laughs] he really scrambles through the brush and everything.
1:18:17
You’d done quite a bit of walking through the woods yourself by that time.
1:18:18
Yeah,
1:18:26
I wasn’t really having a tough time of it, but you had to hustle right along.
1:18:33
Roy had a cocker spaniel named Rusty, and when you’d start out in
1:18:39
the morning, Rusty would run this way and that way like dogs do.
1:18:43
But, by the end of the day, if you were coming back cross-country through
1:18:47
old-growth wind-throw and every other darn thing, that dog couldn’t make it.
1:18:53
[Laughter] You’d have to pick him up and put him over the log, because
1:18:56
he just couldn’t get over it.
1:18:57
He had him completely pooped.
1:19:00
And that was one time you could easily stay up with Roy, because he’d
1:19:03
have to keep track of that dog, or I’d be keeping track of that mutt.
1:19:06
He wouldn’t make you carry it though, right?
1:19:08
Well, I did carry it
1:19:12
some.
1:19:12
I wouldn’t carry it very far, but I would carry it over a
1:19:12
log or something like that.
1:19:16
Well, it’s something then, you were there just for the summer, and you
1:19:22
then you spent two years off and on later in the ‘70s, but that was a
1:19:26
pretty tight-knit group you were in.
1:19:28
Yeah,
1:19:31
that was a good group.
1:19:32
That was a wonderful year.
1:19:33
It probably was one of the most entertaining years, I
1:19:37
think, that I have ever had.
1:19:39
That, along with the work I did with Mike Kerrick when I went over
1:19:46
to the district.
1:19:48
That was a wonderful summer.
1:19:53
And I was young enough, and working hard enough, that I could eat
1:19:56
food like crazy and not get fat.
1:19:58
[Laughs] I remember, the food was magnificent.
1:19:58
I remember I used to work for a farmer, and part of the wages was
1:19:59
to give us dinner, and I never ate so much fish and chicken in my life.
1:20:01
[Laughter] Anyway, you mentioned that this experience really had no
1:20:07
parallels except when you worked with
1:20:11
Mike Kerrick,
1:20:31
for the district.
1:20:31
[Blue River Ranger District, Willamette National Forest] Was that the same period?
1:20:34
Well, it’s the same period.
1:20:36
I worked
1:20:38
on the experimental forest, and then I worked with Mike, because
1:20:43
that’s when they ran out of money.
1:20:45
Okay, I’m sorry.
1:20:47
And I don’t remember how long that was.
1:20:49
I think I worked with Mike for about a month.
1:20:51
That was the last part of the summer, right?
1:20:52
The last part of the summer, right.
1:20:52
Now, you didn’t have a lot
1:20:57
of contacts at the time you started working there for knowing what was going
1:21:01
on, but compared to the other places you’ve worked, was there anything unusual
1:21:07
about this place and the people you were working with, that really strikes you?
1:21:12
No, no, it wasn’t unusual, it was certainly different than, after that
1:21:18
when I worked for the experiment station.
1:21:20
But then, I was on the road all the time working for Ken Wright
1:21:24
as an entomologist, so it was an entirely different kind of life.
1:21:29
Also, we went to Portland and that was our home base.
1:21:34
So, we would be in Portland a lot, which was vastly different from
1:21:40
when I was working at the Andrews.
1:21:43
Portland was some distant place I’d heard about.
1:21:47
You’d never been there then?
1:21:48
Well, I shouldn’t say that, because my folks had lived in Forest Grove, and
1:21:53
that’s only 20 miles from Portland.
1:21:54
But the headquarters, I knew there was a headquarters somewhere in
1:21:59
Portland, and there was a station director [PNW] there, and later, I
1:22:01
got to know the station directors.
1:22:04
But, I didn’t know them that first year.
1:22:09
In those days, I think the station director knew everybody in the station,
1:22:13
including the summer employees.
1:22:15
And he probably introduced himself
1:22:21
to me.
1:22:21
It didn’t ring a bell, but I know after, when I worked in later years as
1:22:26
a summer employee, that I did know the director, and the director knew me,
1:22:32
and everybody there.
1:22:32
The station was a lot smaller then.
1:22:35
Did you know Phil Briegleb?
1:22:36
Oh yeah.
1:22:37
I knew Phil.
1:22:40
Roy told this story about Phil Briegleb coming out and spotting the Andrews
1:22:40
as a place to study old growth.
1:22:40
Oh, is that right?
1:22:40
I didn’t know that.
1:22:40
Yeah, he was telling me he went out there on a backpacking trip or something.
1:22:43
I was just curious, I don’t know how much you know about that.
1:22:43
I had known him when
1:22:50
he was
1:22:57
the director [PNW Station, 1964-71] , of course, and I don’t remember
1:23:02
him before his being the director.
1:23:07
[Laughs]
1:23:07
I can check with some other sources.
1:23:10
Do you recall when he was the director?
1:23:13
I remember him when he was the director, but I didn’t know
1:23:15
him before he was the director.
1:23:17
There was several people before him,
1:23:23
as the director.
1:23:24
I don’t get the sense he was much of a real close friend, or anything?
1:23:28
You knew him, but
1:23:29
-- ? Oh, I knew him, yeah.
1:23:30
But, he wasn’t a close friend.
1:23:31
So, it was just a sign of the times, when the director knew
1:23:33
most of the people in the station.
1:23:35
Yeah, in those days, he knew us all.
1:23:37
I mean, he could say the name immediately.
1:23:38
We talked to him
1:23:41
socially, and we had coffee with him.
1:23:45
The first year after Bob Cowlin [Robert Cowlin, PNW Station Director, 1951-60,
1:23:47
colleague of H.J. Andrews, 1930-51] was there, he used to go out for
1:23:48
coffee with everybody, and he was about the last one I can remember who did
1:23:54
that.
1:23:54
[Laughs] But, it’s possible that Phil did.
1:23:56
That was still pretty casual in those days, too.
1:23:58
Cowlin would take people out individually, or he would
1:24:02
-- ? Oh no, he would just join us.
1:24:04
There would be a bunch of people, say, from the insect division,
1:24:10
and we would all go down to the local [spot] . There was a
1:24:14
little corner restaurant there where we would have coffee.
1:24:20
For some reason we never made coffee in the place, we always went out.
1:24:25
So, when we went out, Cowlin would very often join us.
1:24:30
Had coffee with us.
1:24:32
That’s an interesting change to go from going out for coffee to having it in.
1:24:37
Yeah, we never did that.
1:24:38
I can’t remember anybody having coffee in.
1:24:41
We always had it out.
1:24:44
And really, for about the rest of the time I was in the station, we still went out.
1:24:49
Some people made their coffee in, but the station statisticians and
1:24:55
I, and several other people; we always went out and had coffee.
1:24:59
Even when I went back in 1982, from 1982 to ’84, we’d still go out and have coffee.
1:25:05
I was going to say, once you’d gotten used to that, it would be hard to give that up.
1:25:07
If you had any chance at all.
1:25:13
[Laughing]
1:25:13
Sounds like what you’re saying is, once
1:25:17
you got into entomology, the kind of research you were doing, was really
1:25:20
more based out of the lab somewhere.
1:25:23
You’d drive up to a place, do your work, and get out.
1:25:24
Yeah, and that we worked out of Portland and we didn’t have
1:25:27
any place we really stayed at.
1:25:33
When I first started out, you hardly ever stayed in motels, you always stayed in
1:25:36
ranger stations [U.S. Forest Service] . Ranger stations always seemed to have
1:25:39
a place where you could stay, that they had extra space in the bunkhouse.
1:25:45
Some of them even had a special room, and we used to do that fairly often.
1:25:53
Another thing is, we worked a lot with Weyerhaeuser Company for some reason.
1:25:58
I guess because Ken Wright had a lot of contacts with Weyerhaeuser, so I spent a
1:26:02
lot of time on the Millacoma tree farms down at Coos Bay, and up at Mount St.
1:26:04
Helens, and places where the Weyerhaeuser company [had operations] , and we’d stay
1:26:12
in their
1:26:16
bunkhouse at night.
1:26:17
That raises some things.
1:26:21
The first one, when you were working with people in the Forest Insect Research
1:26:25
[FIR] , were you aware of anybody doing research at that time in the Andrews?
1:26:29
No.
1:26:30
There was nobody doing
1:26:34
any research in the Andrews on anything.
1:26:36
When I first started working for Ken, we were working on Douglas-fir beetles,
1:26:42
and they had just had a big blowdown, and they’d had a lot of blowdown in the
1:26:46
Andrews Experimental Forest in that one.
1:26:48
They had one big, rip-roaring storm that took down a lot of trees.
1:26:51
I remember, both Hank and Roy talked about that.
1:26:56
You might want to talk to them about that.
1:26:57
That was a scary time.
1:26:58
They were clear back in the forest and had this damn windstorm come
1:27:01
in and trees were falling all
1:27:06
over the place.
1:27:06
In fact, I think Roy was talking about something like that.
1:27:14
Hank told me that they got down,
1:27:19
I don’t know if they were together or not, but they got down behind a great
1:27:23
big tree that was already down, just waited it out, and the wind blew.
1:27:28
That meant coming out late at night and crawling over a mess
1:27:33
of wind-throw and so forth.
1:27:35
If you would talk to him, I think that was something that would
1:27:39
scare the crap out of anybody.
1:27:40
So, when was that particular windstorm?
1:27:40
That wouldn’t be the …? [See Gratkowski 1956 publication in Forest Science
1:27:40
about wind-throw in the Andrews Forest]
1:27:40
You know,
1:27:46
I’m not sure exactly when that was.
1:27:49
It was ’52 that sticks in my mind as the windstorm and windfall, but it
1:27:56
might have been, it might have been
1:28:00
’51.
1:28:05
The beetle, the Doug-fir beetle comes up pretty fast after wind-throw.
1:28:10
What happens is the beetles go into the wind-throw and then the populations
1:28:15
build up in one year, and then they go to green trees, and if you get enough
1:28:20
wind-throw, and enough time to build up the population, I think there may
1:28:26
have been a small wind-throw the year before that, too, so I think they had
1:28:28
three years in a row of new wind-throw.
1:28:33
I’m curious, because
1:28:37
with
1:28:41
wind-throw and the concern about beetles, why there were not studies
1:28:43
done on this at the Andrews.
1:28:44
[More studies on wind-throw in later years in/around the HJA]
1:28:44
. I don’t know.
1:28:46
I can’t tell you that either.
1:28:47
I can’t remember that much beetle-kill in the Andrews, and that may have been it.
1:28:53
There were other places where they had a lot of beetle kill, and the coast,
1:28:58
the Coast forest was one; coastal Siuslaw and on the Millacoma Tree
1:29:02
Farm, which was Weyerhaeuser land.
1:29:06
It seems to me that’s where most of the beetle kill was, but I can’t
1:29:12
say for sure.
1:29:13
Now, I don’t know enough about this, but
1:29:15
– -- But at any rate, I know they didn’t do a lot of research up there.
1:29:18
You know, it’s funny, when I first
1:29:21
went to FIR [Forest Insect Research] , they didn’t do a lot of research.
1:29:27
We had two groups.
1:29:29
We had surveys and we had research, they were sort of mixed,
1:29:34
and people sort of did both.
1:29:38
When I first came there, we did a lot more extension work than we did research.
1:29:45
Oh, I see.
1:29:45
And it sort of was a bone of contention, really, later in our careers, because
1:29:51
everybody says, “Well, you were in the experiment station all this
1:29:53
time, where are all the publications in those early years?” Well, there
1:29:57
was no emphasis on publications, the emphasis was on going out and
1:30:00
helping people with their problems.
1:30:03
So, you did surveys?
1:30:04
Yeah.
1:30:05
And flew out to help the ranger districts, private companies and everybody else.
1:30:10
So, an experimental forest wouldn’t really be on your priority list?
1:30:11
No, it really wasn’t on the agenda.
1:30:15
Sure.
1:30:15
Did you know Don Schmiege?
1:30:15
Yeah, I
1:30:21
knew Don.
1:30:22
I talked to him on the Alaska study I did earlier.
1:30:26
He talked along similar lines.
1:30:28
In that case, he was talking about Alaska and the relative lack of resources and
1:30:33
the number of people who needed them, and they were always in a reactionary mode.
1:30:36
Is that true down here also?
1:30:37
Yeah, it was sort of that way too.
1:30:39
We were always fighting the last major crisis, and we even had an organization
1:30:47
that sort of generated crises.
1:30:49
It was called the Northwest Forest Health Action Council.
1:30:56
Any time there was a little crisis, they always got on it to see if they could
1:31:01
get some more money from somewhere, and the government would give them
1:31:05
more entomologists in those situations.
1:31:06
Actually, I came on in that respect.
1:31:09
The crisis that I came on for was the balsam woolly aphid [invasive
1:31:12
species] , which was an introduced pest from Europe that kills true firs.
1:31:20
Who was on that council?
1:31:22
Well, Bob Furniss, who was the division chief, really,
1:31:27
he was sort of the hidden member.
1:31:29
[Laughing] He was the guy who sort of pulled all the strings, but there
1:31:34
was a guy named Bill Hagenstein,
1:31:38
a lobbyist for industrial forestry, who was one of the critical guys.
1:31:44
Another guy was named Ernie Colby.
1:31:47
He was also sort of a lobbyist for, but
1:31:52
he was more of a local lobbyist.
1:31:53
Hagenstein was a lobbyist from Washington, D.C.
1:31:59
Bob Furniss, and Ernie Colby, and Bill Hagenstein, sort of
1:32:06
run that organization.
1:32:08
Hmm.
1:32:08
In that order, but Bob Furniss was sort of sub-rosa.
1:32:11
He
1:32:14
played behind the scenes, because he wasn’t officially supposed
1:32:17
to be doing anything like that.
1:32:20
So, Hagenstein was probably pretty much running the show?
1:32:24
Yeah.
1:32:25
Colby and Hagenstein.
1:32:31
The other topic you covered earlier, you mentioned there was
1:32:36
some work done at Mount St. Helens.
1:32:37
Was there any relation to the volcanic plots up there in 1980?
1:32:43
No.
1:32:44
I actually had several plots up there myself, but they were all blown flat
1:32:49
[by 1980 eruption] . We worked on the balsam woolly aphid, first picked
1:32:54
up in the Mount St. Helens area, and
1:32:59
that’s where we did our early work, on Weyerhaeuser Company land
1:33:01
and the Gifford Pinchot Forest.
1:33:02
The Weyerhaeuser Company property there was quite mixed; it was
1:33:07
checker-boarded all throughout there.
1:33:07
[Alternate section land-ownership pattern] Some of our best and biggest
1:33:11
populations were on Weyerhaeuser land, so I worked with Norm Johnson.
1:33:18
Do you know Norm Johnson?
1:33:20
Yeah.
1:33:20
There’s more than one Norm Johnson.
1:33:23
There’s a Norm Johnson that’s in the university system [forest policy
1:33:27
professor in OSU] , and there’s a Norm Johnson that’s president
1:33:29
of the Weyerhaeuser Company.
1:33:30
Okay.
1:33:31
I don’t know that one [Weyerhaeuser]
1:33:31
. [Laughing] That’s the one I’m more concerned with.
1:33:34
Okay.
1:33:38
That’s an important distinction.
1:33:41
The reason I asked is that the reason that Mount St. Helens got my attention,
1:33:44
is that the Andrews group as it eventually emerged in the 1970s, really
1:33:49
kind of jelled around the Mount St. Helens explosion , as I understand.
1:33:53
They went up there
1:33:58
and had this “pulse,” [group science endeavors that involved intense field work
1:33:59
in one locale for 2 weeks or so] and I’m just curious if you had any interaction,
1:34:04
if you had any plots up there?
1:34:07
No.
1:34:07
I had plots up there, but I never really was involved with them.
1:34:10
They were not just in poor condition, they had just disappeared.
1:34:17
I mean, there was nothing left of them.
1:34:19
They just blew ‘em all to pieces [St.
1:34:22
Helens’ May 18 eruption] . There was nothing there to look at.
1:34:24
[Laughs]
1:34:25
So
1:34:27
there would be a lot of down trees in other areas up there?
1:34:32
Yeah, but I never really got involved in it at all.
1:34:35
I would have liked to, because it was country I’d worked in a lot.
1:34:39
For example, I knew Harry Truman [old-timer who refused to leave his lodge
1:34:44
on Spirit Lake at base of Mt. St. Helens, became a media “celebrity,” and was then
1:34:45
killed in landslide and eruption] . I used to go out and shoot the shit with him.
1:34:47
He was the guy up there at Spirit Lake?
1:34:47
Yeah, he was the guy that got buried up there.
1:34:49
[eruption] I worked up there quite a bit and for a long time,
1:34:58
but it was always my impression the Andrews Group got started before that.
1:35:05
The university got involved at Andrews, once the university got involved and
1:35:10
there was National Science Foundation money drifting in, that’s when things
1:35:14
really started happening out there.
1:35:17
Yeah.
1:35:17
I don’t think the Forest Service money was key.
1:35:21
There wasn’t a lot of it in there, I don’t think, because it was nothing fundamental.
1:35:26
It [Forest Service research in 1950s] was mostly silviculture
1:35:27
research and watersheds, stuff like
1:35:29
that.
1:35:29
Yeah, I think that’s pretty accurate.
1:35:30
I think in the 1970s, the IBP sort of took off, and Fred [Swanson] was
1:35:38
talking about Mount St. Helens as a time when they kind of took their
1:35:43
show on the road and really started to think about the broader implications.
1:35:49
Yeah, that could be.
1:35:53
The
1:35:56
thing I’m most interested here is that you had a really memorable experience
1:36:02
in that summer you were down there, and then you did go back there, but the
1:36:06
Andrews never really became a central focus of anything you did after that.
1:36:09
No.
1:36:10
Never did.
1:36:10
There was no reason to, I guess.
1:36:12
I worked on a number of different problems, and that one little aphid
1:36:21
study was the only one that I did.
1:36:23
I only went there because it fit in geographically.
1:36:27
I had some plots elsewhere, and I wanted that location, because
1:36:32
it was in the Cascades, and I had some in the coast forests.
1:36:39
I knew the trees should be about the right age, I could drive to them,
1:36:43
and that they would be protected, at least hoped they would get protection.
1:36:47
[Laughter] I had a bad experience on the Wind River, or on the Cascade Head
1:36:51
[Experimental Forest] , where I’d had a plot that I’d been working on for
1:36:54
a number of years, that got cleaned out, because they forgot about it.
1:36:59
Bob Ruth was in charge of the forest then, he’d forgotten all about it,
1:37:03
and allowed the Siuslaw National Forest to get in there, and just
1:37:07
really screwed up 10 years of work.
1:37:10
Did you do much work at Cascade Head?
1:37:12
Yeah, I worked over there quite a bit.
1:37:15
I worked on the Sitka spruce weevil for quite a bit, and I had a plot over there I
1:37:21
did every year for 25 years, and with Ken Wright and Norm Johnson, who I mentioned.
1:37:27
We published on it just recently.
1:37:28
Do
1:37:32
you recall much about the administration of that forest,
1:37:38
the people that were involved?
1:37:42
Who did you have contact with over there is sort of what I’m getting at.
1:37:44
Well, the guy I mentioned, Bob Ruth, was the forester who was in charge of that.
1:37:50
And there was a technician over there who lived there, we’d talk to him,
1:37:55
he kept the roads cleaned out, and generally knew where things were.
1:38:00
[Jack Booth] But Bob Ruth was the forester-in-charge, and he actually lived
1:38:05
over there for a while in that cabin.
1:38:08
Then there was another guy named Verne Yerkes, that lived there afterwards,
1:38:11
and he later went back to Minnesota, to
1:38:18
the experiment station over there.
1:38:18
Another guy named Bob Matteson, was
1:38:22
a forester on the forest there.
1:38:25
I don’t think anybody moved in there after Verne Yerkes.
1:38:30
He actually lived in that house.
1:38:30
There was a nice house there.
1:38:32
Have you been there?
1:38:33
No, I haven’t.
1:38:33
Well, there’s a nice house there that’s still there.
1:38:36
Foresters did live in that house.
1:38:43
I’m curious, because Roy talked about the development of Cascade Head in comparison
1:38:43
to what he was doing over at the Andrews.
1:38:43
You obviously worked there for a long period of time, it sounds like.
1:38:43
It was 25 years that you were
1:38:53
involved there?
1:38:53
Yeah, 25 years.
1:38:58
There’s a lot of reasons for why you would put in sites there, but did you
1:39:00
have any perceptions of the differences between the two experimental forests?
1:39:01
Well, it was
1:39:04
more established, for one thing.
1:39:09
Cascade Head had places where we could stay, that was the one reason we stayed
1:39:13
there, and of course, because I was working with the Sitka spruce weevil,
1:39:13
obviously, the Sitka spruce weevil is not a problem in the Andrews, because
1:39:13
they didn’t have any Sitka spruce.
1:39:13
But facilities, it sounds like?
1:39:13
Yeah, the facilities service there was nice.
1:39:13
They had a good place to stay, and you didn’t have anything
1:39:13
like that in the Andrews.
1:39:14
As I said, I didn’t even know they had anyplace there until I was
1:39:14
talking to Martha the other day.
1:39:14
It’s all been built since ’90 something, ’91 or ’92.
1:39:14
[Permanent campus at H.J. Andrews with administration, lodging,
1:39:14
classroom, and laboratory facilities, mostly built in early 1990s.]
1:39:14
Is that right?
1:39:14
Before that it was trailer houses, things like that.
1:39:14
[Nicknamed “Ghetto in the Meadow”]
1:39:14
But anyhow, there was no place to stay there, and there’s really not
1:39:14
many places to stay up the river.
1:39:14
I can only think of one motel up there by the golf course, that’s
1:39:17
the only
1:39:31
place I know of to stay up there.
1:39:32
[Up-river area, Blue River to McKenzie Bridge and east
1:39:41
of there in
1:39:54
river valley.]
1:39:56
So really, the isolation of the site was a deterrent for you to do any work up there?
1:40:07
Yeah, it’s really not an easy spot to get to, and if you do get up there, it’s
1:40:11
not a place you can get a place to stay.
1:40:14
Uh-huh.
1:40:16
And there just wasn’t that much research on Douglas-fir.
1:40:19
It’s interesting how entomology works.
1:40:23
I always wondered how long it would take everybody, somebody in Washington [D.C.
1:40:26
office] to find out that we didn’t do much entomology research on the west side.
1:40:32
Most of it was done on the east side [of Cascades’ crest] But all the entomologists
1:40:33
were stationed on the west side.
1:40:33
Huh.
1:40:33
I was really one of the first entomologists to
1:40:33
come to the east side, but
1:40:42
I was probably the one who worked most on the west side.
1:40:45
[Laughs]
1:40:47
How did that happen?
1:40:48
I don’t know how that happened, but, when this lab wanted an entomologist,
1:40:57
I was selected.
1:40:57
I wasn’t sure exactly how I was selected, but I didn’t mind it.
1:41:05
That’s an interesting comment, because I think that Roy was mentioning how
1:41:09
all of their work before they started at the Andrews was on the east side.
1:41:12
Roy or Al Levno, one of the two, were talking about it.
1:41:15
I think it was Roy,
1:41:15
Yeah.
1:41:15
Then he was put in charge of developing this forest on
1:41:18
the west side.
1:41:19
His
1:41:23
research interests were there.
1:41:24
I’m just intrigued with what
1:41:34
you were saying about how the facilities at
1:41:41
Cascade Head were attractive to you.
1:41:43
What kind of things were you doing there?
1:41:45
Well, Sitka spruce weevil was a problem in the spruce all up
1:41:48
and down the coast of Oregon and Washington, and into British Columbia.
1:41:55
Ken Wright, who I worked for, had always been interested in it, so he had worked
1:42:01
a lot with Franz Auerbach in Seaside, and he wanted to do some work down in Cascade
1:42:07
Head, too, in the stands of Sitka spruce.
1:42:09
That’s where the work is done, and so that’s one reason
1:42:14
why we were there, actually.
1:42:14
I didn’t select those at all.
1:42:16
Ken selected them, and then I just went on from there.
1:42:21
So, the kind of work you were doing required you to spend
1:42:23
a lot of time in the field?
1:42:24
Yeah, we had a lot of plot work.
1:42:29
Even when he was doing genetics work,
1:42:33
Roy was involved there, because there was a genetic component to the program.
1:42:36
They tried to do some grafting, they did a lot of grafting, and I
1:42:43
think they did some sawing work.
1:42:45
Sawing work?
1:42:50
Sawing, you know, making cuttings.
1:42:51
Oh.
1:42:53
And the plot we had over there, was a plot that had 10 species
1:42:59
and hybrids of spruce on it.
1:43:02
That’s the one we stayed on for 25 years to check on them, on the degree
1:43:08
of infestations or attacks on the various species and the hybrids,
1:43:12
and how much it affected growth.
1:43:15
So we carried that on.
1:43:18
That was just one of the plots.
1:43:19
We had a couple other plots up in Raymond, Washington, too.
1:43:21
Hmm.
1:43:21
It sounds like Ken Wright was pretty influential in them.
1:43:25
Yeah, he sort of got those started.
1:43:27
He and Norm Johnson, the guy who, as I said was vice president [of
1:43:29
Weyerhaeuser] . He wasn’t always a vice president, he used to be just like us.
1:43:36
[Laughs]
1:43:36
Yeah.
1:43:36
Actually, he was a classmate of mine.
1:43:37
We went to school together.
1:43:37
At OSU?
1:43:43
Oregon State, yeah.
1:43:50
What you just mentioned there, I was going to follow up on that.
1:43:52
I don’t want to keep you too long, if you need to be somewhere.
1:43:55
No, I don’t have to be anywhere.
1:43:57
Okay.
1:43:58
Just a couple more things here.
1:44:01
I think you mentioned earlier that Hank Gratkowski was a graduate of Harvard or
1:44:06
Yale?
1:44:06
I think Yale.
1:44:09
The Yale School of Forestry.
1:44:11
Okay.
1:44:12
Did
1:44:14
you ever get any sense
1:44:19
after getting your degree at OSU, that Syracuse was the place that
1:44:22
you were kind of expected to go?
1:44:24
Yeah, that’s where all forest entomologists in those days
1:44:29
went.
1:44:29
Ken didn’t go there, did he?
1:44:29
Well, Ken actually went to Duke.
1:44:31
Yeah, I’m sorry, that’s right.
1:44:34
He was the exception, though.
1:44:35
Most everybody else in our group, Furniss and [unintelligible, possibly Wright]
1:44:45
they got all of them, almost everyone, almost all the Canadian entomologists too.
1:44:50
We knew almost all of them, too, and all the forest entomologists from
1:44:53
elsewhere had gone to Syracuse, and they had all worked for a guy named
1:44:58
[unintelligible-noted name at SU.]
1:45:00
So, it was kind of a tight-knit group?
1:45:04
Yeah, everybody knew everybody.
1:45:07
Even graduate students knew all the graduate students, and you knew all
1:45:18
the people working in it.
1:45:22
That’s what I was getting at, several schools are like that, close knit, schools
1:45:22
like Yale and Syracuse, where people go there and get pretty close ties.
1:45:26
Did you ever get a sense at Oregon State University that this
1:45:27
kind of a thing was going there?
1:45:27
No,
1:45:35
I never did.
1:45:37
It’s interesting, as I never even gave it a great deal of thought, and
1:45:40
I knew a lot of graduate students at Syracuse who weren’t entomologists,
1:45:45
but when I was at Oregon State, I was in the entomology department.
1:45:52
I don’t know if I knew any graduate students in forestry, despite
1:45:56
the fact my minor was forestry and I took some courses in that.
1:46:00
Maybe I did meet a few and I’ve forgotten them.
1:46:01
So, if
1:46:05
you’re looking at interdisciplinary exchanges, you wouldn’t
1:46:07
say that’s normal at OSU?
1:46:09
No, it wasn’t in those days.
1:46:11
It may be better now than it was, but, it wasn’t, sometimes.
1:46:12
I think there were
1:46:17
a lot of turf wars going on.
1:46:20
I never really paid that much attention, but later,
1:46:24
there was a fellow in, what was
1:46:31
his name now?
1:46:31
He was Chinese, a geneticist that
1:46:37
worked at the state lab over there on Philomath Road.
1:46:42
He had some money and wanted a grad student to do something.
1:46:48
He was a golfer, and he and I went golfing many times.
1:46:52
I once said, “We would really like to know a lot more information about the
1:46:57
insects that lodge in noble fir, in the pine, in the seeds.” He said, “That’s
1:47:03
a good idea, seed-cone insects.” He had some money, and we were going to
1:47:11
have this kid minor in entomology.
1:47:14
We talked
1:47:18
with Jack Lattin, and Jack wouldn’t have anything to do with it.
1:47:20
He said he had to major in entomology or he wouldn’t even touch him.
1:47:25
I was surprised, and I said, “But Jack, the money does not come from
1:47:31
you, it comes from the forestry thing, they want it in the forestry.” But he
1:47:35
didn’t care. He said he had to be in entomology or he wouldn’t touch him.
1:47:35
That’s a pretty sharp line.
1:47:35
Yeah,
1:47:50
I was really surprised, because I’d known Jack for years.
1:47:52
I always thought he’s a pretty level-headed guy, and maybe he thought
1:47:57
he was being level-headed, but I was really kind of irritated by it.
1:47:59
I was on
1:48:03
his [the student] committee,
1:48:08
but we did it in forestry.
1:48:12
I’m trying to keep track of this now.
1:48:14
You went to Syracuse for a masters, and then, you came back and got your
1:48:18
Ph.D. at Oregon State University.
1:48:18
Had things changed at all
1:48:23
in that period, or was Oregon State University
1:48:27
pretty much the same?
1:48:27
No, it was pretty much the same.
1:48:28
I didn’t want to do it in forestry.
1:48:30
I wanted to do it in entomology, because I had had all the
1:48:34
forestry I thought I needed.
1:48:37
What I needed then, was biology, insect biology, so I decided to do it just
1:48:41
in entomology, and minor in forestry.
1:48:41
I didn’t really take a lot of courses in forestry, because
1:48:42
I’d had quite a few of them.
1:48:43
I took a couple of ecology courses there with Bill Ferrell [OSU-COF professor]
1:48:43
, but I really wasn’t over there very much.
1:48:43
I admit that.
1:48:43
I was just trying to get a handle on some of the differences
1:48:43
between Syracuse and OSU.
1:48:43
It just strikes me as interesting that there was so
1:49:15
little contact between entomologists and other programs.
1:49:17
You were telling me is that there was really no entomology work at the Andrews,
1:49:19
although so many people there are from
1:49:34
Oregon State University.
1:49:34
That’s interesting.
1:49:34
One reason for this big difference is that entomology at Oregon State
1:49:39
is a department in another college.
1:49:44
At Syracuse, everybody is in the college of forestry.
1:49:49
[Laughs] Everybody.
1:49:50
Oh, okay.
1:49:51
There’s maybe 3 buildings there and they’re close together, but
1:49:54
everybody is in the same thing.
1:49:56
When you have a graduate student seminar or something, you have
1:50:01
people from every department there, it seems like, because it gets
1:50:05
advertised through the whole system.
1:50:11
All the biologists know about it, about something that’s going on in botany,
1:50:17
zoology, landscaping, or something else.
1:50:22
About the only place that didn’t get involved was the wood products people.
1:50:26
They seemed to be by themselves.
1:50:27
So,
1:50:30
part of it is the architecture.
1:50:31
[Structure of school/departments/disciplines]
1:50:31
Yeah.
1:50:31
It’s the architecture and the administration of it.
1:50:35
We were all in the college of forestry, and then, the college of forestry is
1:50:39
stuck on the campus at Syracuse, but it really belongs to New York State
1:50:43
University [system of state-funded schools] , so we were all by ourselves
1:50:46
over here in this one side of Syracuse
1:50:51
University.
1:50:53
This is probably my last question, as I don’t want to
1:50:54
keep you all day here, today.
1:50:58
It gets tiring after a while.
1:50:58
I know.
1:50:58
[Laughter] Earlier, you were talking about Hank Gratkowski and his wife,
1:51:05
and you said something about how he was from the “old country” school.
1:51:09
We’ve been talking a little bit about some of the differences in terms of
1:51:14
academic careers, and I was just curious.
1:51:16
First of all, he was Polish, wasn’t he?
1:51:19
Yeah, Polish.
1:51:21
I think he was raised in a Polish family, I think, pretty much from the old country.
1:51:27
I don’t think it was a factor in his academic thinking.
1:51:31
I think it was the way he was raised.
1:51:34
Okay, but he wasn’t an immigrant?
1:51:35
No, he was not, himself.
1:51:38
Was his wife, do you know?
1:51:40
No, I don’t think she was either.
1:51:42
I think that his parents
1:51:46
were Polish immigrants.
1:51:48
Maybe.
1:51:48
I don’t even know that for sure.
1:51:50
Oh, okay.
1:51:51
But I think, even back east, if you lived in a Polish community, even if
1:51:56
two or three generations away [from original migration] , they still
1:51:59
keep their culture, pretty much.
1:52:02
Yeah, okay.
1:52:02
You must have noticed that in Minnesota.
1:52:04
[Laughs]
1:52:04
Oh
1:52:06
yeah.
1:52:06
It was often a source of tension there.
1:52:11
I didn’t live there, but my brother grew up on the iron
1:52:14
range with a real diverse mix.
1:52:18
We were Germans, so there was a lot of conflict, actually.
1:52:24
Okay, that line of questioning probably wouldn’t go anywhere then.
1:52:27
I had an idea there that had to do with immigration and Mike
1:52:31
Savelich [Croatian heritage] being hired, and as a contractor.
1:52:35
But Hank was not the person responsible for hiring, or for
1:52:38
contracting anyway, he laid out roads?
1:52:42
Well, I don’t really know how the division of labor there was.
1:52:45
But I remember, Mike used to come to Hank quite frequently, and ask him about
1:52:52
whether he could cut this tree or he’d cut that tree, or if they needed to
1:52:56
change the boundaries on the cutting line.
1:52:58
You know, there’s always sort of give-and-take on these sort of things.
1:53:01
They worked pretty closely together then?
1:53:01
I know that they’d work pretty close together, because I’d be there, standing
1:53:01
there listening to their conversations.
1:53:01
I know they did
1:53:11
that.
1:53:12
The funny thing is, and I’m sure Roy did the same thing,
1:53:17
but I don’t remember it much.
1:53:20
I spent a lot more time with Hank than I did with Roy.
1:53:23
You mentioned that Mike was always pushing for another tree.
1:53:26
Yeah, he always wanted his trees cut.
1:53:28
It just was standard, you know.
1:53:31
Trees are worth a lot.
1:53:32
Each Douglas-fir has got about 5,000 board feet of timber, something like that.
1:53:38
Sounds like that was almost a running joke.
1:53:40
Was Mike really serious?
1:53:42
Oh, I think that he was.
1:53:42
He always tried.
1:53:44
[Laughter]
1:53:44
Yeah, I was curious.
1:53:50
Mike Kerrick mentioned that Mike Savelich was always complaining, and Ed Anderson.
1:53:57
I interviewed him, too.
1:53:57
I don’t know if you knew him.
1:53:58
Who?
1:53:58
Ed Anderson?
1:53:58
He was at the district [Blue River R.D.] for a while.
1:53:58
No, I don’t know him.
1:54:01
Both of them mentioned that Mike Savelich was always complaining
1:54:01
about this or that, how
1:54:07
the plots were laid out, that they were unusual.
1:54:09
You couldn’t fall the trees inside the clear-cuts and things like that,
1:54:11
but he always came back and did it.
1:54:13
There was that complaining going on, but it was always
1:54:22
the same person that did it, so something was working out there.
1:54:24
Yeah, I think they worked pretty well together.
1:54:26
I can imagine that he must have gotten frustrated, because I know Hank
1:54:32
knew exactly how he wanted everything done.
1:54:35
If he wanted the trees all felled this direction, he had a reason for
1:54:39
having them fall that direction, and he probably said that in the contract
1:54:42
that this is how it is supposed to be.
1:54:46
So,
1:54:49
if he had a little corner in the stand, that’s the way he had that corner,
1:54:53
and he had it there for a reason.
1:54:54
It wasn’t just by accident.
1:54:55
It wasn’t just because he happened to be feeling bad
1:54:57
that day, or good, or whatever.
1:54:59
He had a reason.
1:55:01
Because, I remember putting in those lines and taking them out, and
1:55:04
putting them in and taking them out, and, God, I’d feel so frustrated.
1:55:07
[Laughs]
1:55:09
What kinds of things were concerning him?
1:55:12
Most of the time it was about the way the wind was blowing, and where the lines
1:55:18
would be in relation to the topography.
1:55:21
Whether it would be funneling wind into a corner, or over the top of
1:55:25
a ridge, or something like that.
1:55:27
He had some concepts about how the wind blew, and he was trying
1:55:31
to keep the wind-throw on the margins of clear-cuts down.
1:55:35
And we had some old clear-cuts where the wind had gone through and really took out
1:55:41
a lot, because they’d been designed badly.
1:55:44
Well, he was learning from those, and didn’t want to
1:55:48
make that same mistake twice.
1:55:51
I remember a couple places in Sale 1 [1949-50, survey/sale] , where the
1:55:53
clear-cuts were too close together, and the wind came funneling through
1:55:58
and it just ripped out everything, and had a lot of wind-throw.
1:56:04
It’s interesting, the idea of learning from those clear-cuts.
1:56:08
It was pretty quickly, actually, only 3 or 4 years [into
1:56:09
experimental forest’s young history]
1:56:09
. Yeah.
1:56:17
He was right on top of it.
1:56:19
I wanted to ask, and I’ll probably end with this question.
1:56:23
You’ve had some graduate students since you started working at the station.
1:56:32
Have any of your students worked on the Andrews?
1:56:35
No.
1:56:36
None of them did.
1:56:39
Well, I know one thing that I was going to mention, that maybe you
1:56:42
already went through this when you met with Jerry Franklin, but there
1:56:44
was a plantation of cork-bark fir
1:56:50
in the Andrews.
1:56:50
It was there when I was there in ’53.
1:56:53
And I remember Jerry, I think it may be his very first publication, went up and
1:57:00
looked at it, and wrote a paper on it.
1:57:05
I always wondered whatever happened to that, but I bet you
1:57:08
that’s Jerry’s first publication.
1:57:10
I remember reviewing it, because he knew that I had worked on it.
1:57:17
I had done something with it, but I can’t remember what I’d done.
1:57:19
Maybe I’d mapped the trees or something, but,
1:57:23
in my early days.
1:57:24
I don’t even remember why there was a cork bark plantation there.
1:57:31
I wonder if it’s still there.
1:57:33
That’s interesting.
1:57:34
You reviewed his first paper, as far as you know.
1:57:40
Was it a good review?
1:57:40
Yeah.
1:57:41
He did a good job.
1:57:42
Jerry always was a good writer.
1:57:44
Did you know Jerry very closely?
1:57:45
Yeah, I knew him pretty well.
1:57:46
He and I wrote at least one paper together, and we
1:57:51
actually got an award for it.
1:57:53
That was an interesting paper, too.
1:57:54
Jerry and I are actually both good writers, I guess, but we
1:58:03
do it differently.
1:58:05
[Laughs]] So, we put this paper together, we re-wrote and re-wrote and
1:58:09
sent it back-and-forth, back-and-forth, and neither one of us was happy
1:58:13
with what the other one had done.
1:58:15
But we finally got it through, and we submitted it to the guy
1:58:19
who was head of timber management.
1:58:21
He’d just been to some short course in Bend or someplace, and he was
1:58:25
cutting out articles and our words.
1:58:29
He didn’t agree and butchered it something awful.
1:58:32
And then, Ken Wright got involved in it, and he butchered it up some more.
1:58:37
So, Jerry and I got this thing back,
1:58:42
and we said, “This is a Goddamn bunch of bullshit.” What we
1:58:44
did is we wrote a real nice story and letter about how nice it was, and how
1:58:50
much they’d helped us and everything, and then we went ahead and left it
1:58:53
exactly like it was. [Laughs] Submitted it for publication, it sailed right
1:58:57
through, and we got an award for
1:59:01
it. [Laughter] Then these two guys said, “See how much our help got
1:59:04
you.” [Laughing] Yeah, it really
1:59:09
helped out.
1:59:10
I wasn’t aware of this collaboration you were involved in.
1:59:13
How did
1:59:16
you get together with Jerry?
1:59:17
He and I were both working on subalpine [fir]
