00:04
Interview taking place 1 p.m., Friday, November 14, 1997; Cordley
00:12
Hall, Oregon State University.
00:28
The primary focus of the book is on the concept of a community
00:32
of researchers and scholars.
00:35
The thing that I am interested in is the way that people formed connections
00:38
and collaborations, things like that.
00:41
That is kind of what brings me here to you.
00:43
I don’t know why you came to have that emphasis, but I think that is the emphasis
00:50
that makes the Andrews Forest unique.
00:56
A lot of other scientific endeavors, and certainly a
01:04
number of other LTER programs and
01:11
other programs underwritten by large, federal bureaucracies, in this
01:19
case, NSF, they are written for a specific goal – [not collaborative]
01:23
Go ahead.
01:23
-- are written for specific
01:31
goals, and Andrews Forest is rather unique in that respect.
01:37
Actually, my association with the Andrews is probably longer than most of
01:42
the other folks here, except for McKee.
01:49
Back in the `60’s when the Andrews Forest was part of the International
01:54
Biological Program rather than the LTER program, I was a researcher
02:02
involved in another IBP program, in a convergent evolution program.
02:08
At that time, I had met Art McKee, and become friends with Art.
02:14
And so, I’ve sort of been aware of what has been going on in the Andrews Forest
02:20
for over 30 years, and things have changed very significantly in those times, as
02:26
you no doubt know, and have documented undoubtedly [laughing] many times over.
02:31
But,
02:33
I didn’t have a good feel for the flavor of the Andrews Forest
02:39
until, let’s say the mid-`70’s, when I ended up here in Corvallis.
02:48
By that time, I would say that the general flavor and organization of the
02:53
“quote- unquote” Andrews Forest group, had changed very significantly, as you
02:58
would expect from the early-days to a mature research group. Personally,
03:06
I think it’s changed very much for the better.
03:10
A lot of the unique characteristics, the give-and-take of the scientists,
03:14
the give-and-take between science and management, and the
03:20
give-and-take between science,
03:27
public policy, and educational outreach, the mesh of all that, had totally, well,
03:35
it was changing by that time in the mid `70’s, and certainly, by the mid `80’s.
03:39
And it had totally changed, I think, for the better.
03:43
That is what makes the Andrews unique.
03:46
Whether it is better or worse, who the hell knows, depends upon
03:48
your political point-of-view?
03:49
But certainly, the unique flavor of the Andrews and how it works,
03:53
and how science, public policy, and
03:58
public ethics, that mix, has evolved.
04:03
That is in fact unique to the Andrews, and that has evolved primarily over
04:06
the last 15 years now, I would say.
04:11
At the time that you first became involved, was that characteristic?
04:14
Not at all, I would say.
04:16
At that time, the Andrews Forest was held up by other members of other IBP programs
04:23
as a classic example of a very provincial, one-goal-oriented, descriptive science,
04:35
and certainly not all-encompassing
04:42
and balanced.
04:45
Relatively speaking?
04:46
The give-and-take between a whole bunch of research groups with different
04:53
interests and different agendas; that didn’t exist in those days at all.
04:57
It was sort of an archetype of the opposite.
05:02
[Laughs]
05:03
You said that you were involved in the convergent evolution program with IBP.
05:06
Where was that located?
05:07
That was run basically out of Stanford University.
05:13
That was the center basically, but there were other areas.
05:17
We were studying convergent evolution in Chile, California, Arizona, and Argentina.
05:26
We were looking at old questions that Von Humboldt and Darwin had originally posed.
05:32
By God, you look at the desert in the southern hemisphere, you look at
05:35
it in the northern hemisphere, and the plants and animals look alike.
05:39
The real question, and they came from different ancestors, because things
05:43
evolve outward from the tropics towards the poles, and the question
05:47
is to study this ecologically, in an ecosystem-process mode.
05:53
How similar do those ecosystems function?
05:57
That was the real question.
05:58
I mean, we knew for 150 years that things look alike.
06:02
I mean, things looked like cacti here and there, Africa and what not.
06:05
The question was how does real conversion evolution occur, and
06:10
in which case do you want to look at actual ecosystem processes?
06:14
So, I was involved in that project for a number of years.
06:21
I served on a committee
06:26
where I was a representative of my IBP program, and Art was
06:30
representative of his, and that is how we go to know one another.
06:35
Did you get involved in the IBP at Stanford through your doctoral work there?
06:38
Right.
06:40
Back
06:43
up a bit and talk about your activities, your academic training, and doctoral work.
06:51
Well, I don’t know.
06:52
Talk to me.
06:52
I don’t know what relevance I have to anything.
06:54
What I am trying to get here is kind of a snapshot of people.
07:00
How their ideas about science originated, what academic career they
07:06
come from, what led them into this line of work in the first place, and
07:09
how those connections come together around the end of the article?
07:14
Where are you from originally?
07:16
I’m not sure I can answer the question, but lead me on if it is
07:21
interesting and if I don’t answer it.
07:25
Both my parents were scientists, but one of them was involved in education,
07:32
well, they both were to a certain extent, and the other was an archetypal
07:41
taxonomist.
07:41
My dad was world-famous, and so, as a kid, every week we would have somebody
07:47
from another part of the world, some biologist would come and visit.
07:50
So, as a kid, I obviously became interested in science, natural
07:54
history, ecology, early on.
07:59
Then,
08:02
once I had a good liberal arts training as an undergraduate, I came to Stanford.
08:09
I think the value at Stanford was, and I still continue to think it is
08:14
relative to all other schools, where my wife and I have taught or what not, is
08:19
that the minute that you walk in there, once you were accepted as a graduate
08:22
student, you were treated as a colleague and you were no longer a student.
08:26
It allowed you to participate in discussions, think for yourself, and
08:33
because of that and the very high stature of my thesis advisors and
08:40
world-wide globe-trotting and all the rest they did, it allowed me to have
08:45
a much broader view of ecological questions than most people did.
08:52
And because my dad was a botanist and world-famous, I couldn’t be a botanist.
08:56
You couldn’t live up to that, so I was an entomologist, and so my work
09:02
hence has always been ecological.
09:05
It has always been the interrelations of critters with plants and visa-a-versa.
09:09
Because of that, and I think my training at Stanford and the really
09:14
excellent people that I worked with there, and the excellent
09:17
people my wife worked with there,
09:21
I tend to think as we all do, that we have a great, personal view of ecology,
09:26
surpassing in all the rest of that.
09:28
I think it is a much broader view of ecology than many people have.
09:32
I count my blessings for that.
09:33
That is not my own, you know, that is just luck.
09:37
Luck of the draw.
09:39
Who do you identify at that point in your graduate career of your mentor,
09:42
someone who brought you along?
09:45
The people who brought me along, primarily at Stanford, were Paul Ehrlich
09:48
and Peter Raven, my principle thesis advisors, and then Hal Mooney, who was
09:57
my close advisor during the IBP days in North and South America.
10:05
They don’t come any better than those three people, of course.
10:10
How did you get involved in the
10:15
IBP program?
10:15
Maybe you could describe that.
10:15
My interests were in pollination ecology.
10:20
And one of the basic ecosystem prophecies that takes place no matter where you
10:25
are in the world, is pollination.
10:27
There is seed dispersal, there is primary photosynthesis, there is
10:32
predation, and all the rest, but, pollination is one of the unique
10:35
ones, and since I had both, through training in or interest in entomology
10:42
and botany, it is a natural for me.
10:46
I became interested and developed a number of the techniques and things
10:52
that were neat about community approaches to pollination ecology.
10:57
That was the line that I worked in, I don’t know, 10 or 15 years
11:02
before coming here to Oregon.
11:06
It was a lot of fun.
11:07
We learned an awful lot of things.
11:09
A lot of really neat stuff, many things that blew my mind.
11:12
I got to see lots of parts of the world that were nifty.
11:16
And the more you see, of course, the more you get excited about these things.
11:21
And then, coming here to Oregon for various incidental and practical
11:25
reasons, my interests have largely shifted now to food-web biology
11:33
and function and biodiversity.
11:37
For the past ten years or so, I have been working primarily in that arena.
11:43
That is probably most of the way I have been interacting with the Andrews Forest,
11:48
and participating in the outreach of the Andrews Forest, and in the whole
11:54
change in the paradigm of growing plantations of Douglas-fir trees to
12:01
“quote-unquote” ecosystem management and biodiversity, and all the rest of
12:05
that. Which is now somewhat current, at least it’s the letter of the law.
12:12
I’m curious if
12:23
you were there about a year?
12:25
At Kansas?
12:25
Yeah, I was there for a year.
12:26
And then you went to from there to Stanford.
12:27
I was just curious, what was reason in terms of your research?
12:35
Oh, it was just that my fiancée, whom I had met as an undergraduate,
12:39
was at Stanford, and Kansas couldn’t really give us much hope of funding,
12:45
whereas Stanford said that they would support the both of us for four years,
12:48
so there wasn’t much.… [Laughing]
12:51
Easy choice.
12:52
Yeah
12:54
Then from Stanford, you were working at UC-Santa Cruz in
12:58
research for about 6-7 years, right?
13:01
That was during IBP period?
13:01
Yeah.
13:03
I was curious.
13:05
You leave in `77, and that is about the time you came to OSU?
13:08
Yeah, more or less.
13:11
One of the problems is that I get involved in so many things that
13:14
I never have time to publish.
13:16
I didn’t do enough publishing, so I did some perishing.
13:20
But the real problem was, I didn’t particularly approve of the educational
13:26
philosophy at UC-Santa Cruz.
13:31
Not necessarily what they claimed the teaching philosophy was, but the way
13:35
it actually worked and was practiced.
13:40
Their portfolio base had such a range?
13:41
To a large extent, that is part of it, just a minor part of it.
13:45
And in addition, my wife, who is smarter and has more training than I
13:49
do, wasn’t able to get a job there.
13:52
So we had a period where she was looking for the primary job, and I was going
13:56
to be the house husband and caretaker.
13:58
And we did that.
13:59
She got the job here at OSU, so she has been employed here at OSU,
14:03
whereas I am just a faculty spouse.
14:06
So, even though I control several offices and bring in hundreds of
14:11
thousands of dollars in grants, I
14:15
am the [trailing spouse] . We sort of switched roles.
14:19
Accommodation of the professional reasons.
14:20
Yeah.
14:22
You touched on it a
14:26
little bit, but maybe you could elaborate on it more.
14:26
I was wondering if you might compare and contrast the research at UC-Santa
14:30
Barbara and the teaching emphasis.
14:33
Particularly, I am interested in the kinds of collaborative essentials.
14:37
Well, actually, at UC-Santa Cruz, I collaborated rather
14:41
closely in teaching, but not in research, with Jean Langenheim, a
14:48
very, very bright lady.
14:50
She does some really wonderful stuff and had some really good ideas and
14:54
whose teaching philosophies I shared.
14:57
Her
15:00
main interests were international as well, North and South America.
15:08
But, team teaching, not too much.
15:11
I team taught with Jean at Santa Cruz, thought that was very
15:15
wonderful, I learned a lot from it, and thought that was very good.
15:19
But in terms of research, I was on my own.
15:23
There really wasn’t anyone to deal with there, per se.
15:27
I kept up some contacts at Stanford and at [Cal.] Berkeley and [Cal.]
15:31
Davis, which were just a hop away.
15:37
The collaborative research that I did at that time was all IBP-based, and an
15:41
awful lot of fun, but practicalities
15:47
worked out such that there really wasn’t a way to really start to implement that
15:52
on a different aspect at Santa Cruz.
15:57
But again, at that time there were questions about my wife’s employment and
16:01
my employment, and we wanted to optimize her chances of employment for a while.
16:06
Okay.
16:07
I was curious if there was anybody else that was working on the
16:14
IBP, if there was anybody else besides Art that you became involved with?
16:19
No, only Art up here.
16:22
That is the only way that I had heard of this area and to a large extent since.
16:30
Art and I were on this consumer process committee, which I
16:34
chaired or co-chaired for a while.
16:38
The Andrews Forest basically wasn’t interested in consumer processes,
16:43
and so, Art got a lot of free trips, but couldn’t have anything to report.
16:51
[Laughing]
16:52
Maybe you could characterize
16:57
your perception is of OSU’s potential for collaborative research as concerned
17:01
with you and a number of other places.
17:04
It’s probably not too much a function of the institution.
17:09
It is more a function of people and the positive feedback,
17:14
once a group gets going.
17:17
Other than broad generalizations; when you are at small, private institutions, you
17:25
are much more liable to do collaborative research, especially interdisciplinary
17:30
collaborative research, than you are at a large, state-run institution like OSU.
17:37
And I have found tremendous bureaucratic pressure against
17:42
doing anything collaborative here at OSU, and the only reason I can
17:47
do it is that I am soft money.
17:51
If I were a regular, tenure-track appointee, I would think that there would
17:54
be tremendous bureaucratic pressures on me not to do anything like that.
18:00
So, your wife was
18:03
in that situation of being regular tenure-track here?
18:05
Well, she works half-time in entomology as a researcher, and half-time
18:11
she directs the editing facility for the [OSU] College of Forestry.
18:18
So, she is soft money-hard money mixed, but not really tenure-track either.
18:25
What is her name?
18:26
Allison.
18:26
I think I know her.
18:27
I used to work over there as an editor.
18:30
Oh, you did?
18:31
Yeah, for a period.
18:32
Then you know her, Allison, yeah.
18:34
When Ralph was
18:37
in charge.
18:38
Yeah.
18:42
[Laughter]
18:42
Yeah, that’s Allison.
18:42
You mentioned briefly your first impressions of Andrews as a place
18:46
within the IBP circle that has a representation of being kind
18:49
of about traditional forestry?
18:50
But by the time I came here in the mid-`70’s, I found that the Andrews
18:56
Forest is the only organization within any of the biological departments
19:02
that had an inter-disciplinary interest and scope, and that was at
19:10
least somewhat devoid of egocentric empire-building kinds of crapola that
19:17
normally cuts down on the give-and-take.
19:22
I would say that the only reason I even remained
19:28
associated with OSU for the past 15 years has been because of the Andrews.
19:35
Not for any other reason.
19:38
And even though for the last few years I have been doing things, well, things
19:42
have gotten awfully busy for personal reasons, and I can’t really go to
19:47
meetings every month, and what not.
19:49
But I am still pretty heavily involved with the
19:56
Andrews, and especially in teaching.
20:01
Is that workshops or classes?
20:04
For seven years I co-PI-ed the grant with Art and Joe Beatty on research
20:12
experiences for undergraduates [REU] . That was for seven years or so.
20:18
We taught some of the best undergraduates from the country there
20:22
at the Andrews, during the summer.
20:25
Now I am a collaborator with one of the other grants through Chemekata [Community
20:30
College] , that Art is also co-PI on.
20:33
So, I help out those guys in that junior college’s sustainable forestry program.
20:40
Then, I also have my own grant from NSF, and it’s again a big, big thing,
20:48
a five-year grant where we are taking high school and middle school teachers,
20:53
biology teachers, and giving them hands-on ecology training during the summer.
21:00
All in the hopes that they will get some more give-and-take, and intellectual
21:06
content into their teaching programs in the elementary schools, and try to
21:13
establish a real relationship between the public and the potential for the
21:19
public, either through teaching programs per se, or other groups, to participate
21:27
in monitoring for the Forest Service and BLM, all these other agencies
21:33
whose responsibilities are infinite.
21:36
If they weren’t before, they really are now.
21:39
There is no way government has any personnel, any time, or any money to do
21:44
the things it is now mandated they do with ecosystem management, but, yet, there
21:50
is a tremendous potential for the public to assist these people gathering data
21:57
which otherwise will never be gathered.
21:59
That is the outlook of that particular program, and we have
22:04
been running that now for one year.
22:06
We will be finishing it up this week- next weekend.
22:10
We have a post hoc review of what it was we did right, what we
22:14
did wrong, all the rest of that.
22:15
One of the first post hoc reviews for that project is the Andrews
22:20
Forest, and we have a couple of post hoc reviews around the state, up at Mount
22:24
Hood National Forest and down in the
22:30
Siskiyous.
22:30
That is largely the way that I have been involved with the Andrews the past seven
22:37
to eight to nine years, mostly in the educational capacity and outreach of
22:43
trying to get more people in the public involved in “quote-unquote” science.
22:50
Also, monitoring natural history databases, and trying to get the
22:55
public to actually comprehend what ecosystem management entails and
23:03
means, rather than have a little banner people wave for two to three years,
23:09
the “flavor of the month,” then it goes away and there is nothing left.
23:13
That is where my most of my activities are going now.
23:20
This is on a five-year grant?
23:22
Yes.
23:25
Is there any connection between that and an earlier volunteer program
23:28
that I think Art was involved in?
23:30
Not particularly, no.
23:31
Okay, what are
23:35
the benefits of this?
23:36
The benefits have just been, ever since we started to do “quote-unquote”
23:41
ecosystem management, it’s obvious to anybody who doesn’t work on mammals,
23:48
birds, and big trees - i.e. the non-charismatic biodiversity - that
23:54
nothing will ever be done or can ever be done unless you increase the interest
24:01
group, make more of the public aware of the importance of these things,
24:08
and the neatness of these things.
24:10
And then, try to involve them in the actual process of data-gathering.
24:18
Otherwise it will never be done.
24:19
Period.
24:20
Can
24:23
you recall the first time you actually did work on the Andrews
24:27
or what purpose there was?
24:30
I think the first time I actually did honest-to-God research on the Andrews
24:36
would probably be, I think we moved here in `73, would be `74, when I had contracts
24:41
to do rare plant surveys within the Andrews and the rest of the Willamette
24:48
[National Forest] . I certainly went all through the Andrews, looking for
24:52
rare and endangered plants, and that is probably the major initial way I got
24:59
acquainted with the ground in the Andrews, the diversity of ecological habitats
25:05
and neatness of the area to work in.
25:07
Do you remember your first impressions of the biodiversity and the resource center?
25:12
Yeah.
25:13
Coming from other parts of the world, your first impressions are number one:
25:16
there is no biodiversity here, it is all one species of tree and there is no life
25:21
here, because it is always totally quiet.
25:25
There are never insects singing, never birds singing.
25:28
Coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest are very different
25:31
from the deciduous forests of the east or tropical forests.
25:36
Part of the fun has been taking those initial impressions and
25:41
seeing how remarkably diverse and wonderful all the critters and the
25:46
interactions are that do exist there.
25:49
But the first impression though is always, if you come from any other
25:54
ecosystem in the world, is how incredibly pauperized it is, species-wise.
26:00
How it looks, and then, how incredibly quiet it is, and how difficult it is
26:05
to see organisms there, because it is also dark and misting all the time.
26:10
And drizzling.
26:11
It’s a lot of fun.
26:15
I suppose there are more surprises hidden in Northwest conifer forests
26:20
than in many other places where they are sort of right there and hit your eye.
26:24
Here you have that little, fun game, of trying to look for them first, and
26:30
then, they are neat when you find them.
26:34
You mentioned a quite a bit about journal articles over the years.
26:38
Were there other people working in the Andrews that you began
26:42
to be involved in at this point?
26:45
Largely, most of my involvement has been with Jack Latin in entomology,
26:55
and with Art McKee in botany.
26:59
Then, for the past ten years, with my interest and research focusing primarily
27:07
in soil processes, I have been interacting very closely with people like Mark
27:12
Harmon, Bob Griffiths and Bruce Coldwell.
27:17
And also Elaine [Ingham] . So those are the main people I
27:22
would say I have interacted with.
27:30
What was your impression and perception at the time of the
27:34
purpose of the experimental forest?
27:35
Had you had previous experience in another Forest Service facility like that?
27:40
An experimental forest, no, in terms of the management implications.
27:47
But in terms of a research locality, where you do interdisciplinary
27:51
research, you have that from your research sites at Stanford, Jasper
27:56
Ridge, and then, our international ones, where we set up research sites.
28:00
So, for that point, that is pretty standard.
28:04
But, the unique aspect of the Andrews
28:11
has always been, in the moment certainly, is this interesting, difficult to
28:18
define interaction, between science and management-policy for these vast, vast
28:27
areas of government-controlled land.
28:33
Of course, once you enter that realm of affecting government policy on more
28:38
than 40 acres, you, by definition, have to enter the public arena as well.
28:44
Because you are not just looking out at the back forty there, [laughing]
28:48
you are looking at the whole western United States, and there are a lot
28:51
of people with diverse interests that interact with that land.
28:57
A related issue here, then.
29:04
How would you characterize your target audience, people you see as
29:04
the beneficiaries of your research?
29:15
I don’t know that there is an audience, per se, other than
29:19
yourself, or a minute speck and 360 degrees times two around you.
29:28
Then, every day and every week, you get another phone call from
29:32
another group of people with a totally different perspective
29:36
that want you to speak to them.
29:40
And then, each one of us has to come to our own decisions of how to speak
29:46
to those audiences, to what extent you just talk science, to what extent you
29:53
are careful in generalizations from your work, which everyone has to generalize,
29:58
and to what extent you proselytize.
30:01
Everybody does that too.
30:03
So, it is a very difficult issue, and
30:10
I still worry about it all the time.
30:12
I mean, all the time I still worry about it.
30:15
But, I say for the first 4 or 5 years we were into this sort of mode, and
30:19
I say we as the whole Andrews Forest group, I really worried about it.
30:23
I stayed almost exclusively to science.
30:28
Period.
30:28
Just the science.
30:29
Let other people do the interpretation.
30:32
But then, I realized you couldn’t do that anymore because number one, the people
30:36
you gave that science to automatically made their interpretations, and being
30:43
an egotist, one always realizes that their interpretations are wrong and
30:47
yours are right, so [laugh] you have to give your own interpretations some.
30:51
So, I think I was ultimately dragged into that kicking and screaming.
30:57
And I am sure I can be accused of doing a lot of proselytizing, even though I
31:02
try to think I don’t do that, but I think it is important because there are so
31:07
few people out there who can speak for the non-charismatic [species] diversity.
31:13
And I think also, because
31:22
there are different issues involved in non-charismatic diversity than
31:26
in the other things, like the “cute little spotted owl” and what not.
31:32
The conclusions you can draw, since you can never separate them from politics,
31:39
the conclusions you draw looking at a broader scope of organisms, the whole of
31:43
plants and critters out there, are very, very different than if you just look at
31:49
vertebrates with a specific preconception.
31:53
And there is nothing wrong with that, as everybody has preconceptions, but those
31:56
specific preconceptions are ones that vertebrate ecologists or conservation
32:01
biologists enter an issue with.
32:04
So, nobody else speaks for these things, so it behooves Jack
32:10
[Lattin] and myself to do that.
32:11
Is there any particular science issue that you can see is going to be changing
32:16
perspectives from the earlier ones, where you thought you were just doing science?
32:20
Anything that you were involved in particularly, you began to
32:25
see how it would be interpreted?
32:29
No, I don’t think there is any one issue.
32:38
It’s not an issue, it’s an opportunity in the sense that the problem
32:44
in the Northwest has been for a decade; everybody is so polarized.
32:48
Either on one side or the other.
32:50
You cannot talk in-between.
32:52
The media won’t allow you to talk in-between.
32:55
But, if your interests are in organisms or processes everybody agrees are
33:03
important, but nobody knows anything about, they don’t have pre-formed
33:08
opinions about them, then you can speak to an audience or within a
33:16
framework that doesn’t automatically push you to one side or the other.
33:22
As long as you can sort of be in the middle and talk to people on
33:25
both ends, then I think that’s what makes the difference.
33:31
And I have found far more static from “quote-unquote” conservationists with a
33:40
capital C, or green and fuzzy folks, tree huggers, whatever name you want to put on
33:47
them, than I have from industry or however you want to characterize the far right. I
33:58
have been very pleased with the way most interest groups have accepted
34:05
the science, because I have been able to present it to groups that
34:11
don’t have preconceived notions.
34:14
Can you think of any examples of cases where you were able to
34:17
play that kind of middle role?
34:19
Oh, there are just numerous, numerous examples.
34:21
I am not a politician at all, and I am the shyest person in the world.
34:27
So, I don’t usually think of myself in those roles, and I
34:30
try and avoid those roles, and
34:34
I don’t do this kind of stuff too often either.
34:36
Maybe you talk
34:40
a little about how you began to get more closely involved with the Andrews.
34:44
And after 1974, what was
34:51
your level of awareness of the kind of work of that time?
34:57
You had the earlier perceptions from Art [McKee]
35:00
. Well,
35:03
the useful thing about the Andrews, the two useful things about the Andrews:
35:08
one is, they usually go through the fuss and bother, and that is probably what it
35:13
really is - fuss and bother - of having annual meetings where everybody talks
35:19
about what they do and why they do it.
35:24
And the second aspect is that, with very few exceptions, and I don’t really know
35:28
of any exceptions, other than people.
35:32
I have to talk about bugs and what not.
35:33
But, everybody is able to express themselves in common language, and
35:42
everybody is willing to answer questions like, “Why the hell are you doing
35:46
that - that’s a stupid thing - nobody could possibly be interested in
35:49
that.” Obviously, working on bugs, everybody asked me that, but everybody
35:54
is able to deal with those things.
35:56
That is rather unique in most scientific communities, because of
36:01
that you become aware of what goes on at the Andrews very quickly.
36:08
And in those days, I was doing a great deal of field work in the Andrews as well.
36:15
On spider ecology projects,
36:20
if you live at the Andrews, you interact with these people twenty-four hours a
36:23
day, and so it just becomes second nature.
36:29
So, this is kind of a rapid immersion.
36:34
Yeah, total immersion, largely.
36:38
These annual meetings you are talking about have been kind of
36:41
a key to that common language.
36:43
Is that unusual at the other IBP [and LTER] places you worked at?
36:46
I would assume that never takes place at the other places, or if they do,
36:50
there is very real communication and people get up on their stump
36:54
and say their thing and that is it.
36:56
Whereas, at these meetings, you get very good “dumb” questions from your
37:01
colleagues, and it causes you to rethink what you are doing, and it causes you to
37:04
rethink ways in which interactions may be taking place between what would normally
37:10
be considered to be totally independent variables, and causes you to then do
37:15
collaborative research. That is the hallmark of the Andrews scientifically,
37:21
that is, the collaborative research. And politically or management-wise,
37:27
it’s the hallmark is that incredible sharing of science with management.
37:36
What would you describe as you leading research priority during
37:40
the ‘70’s and 80’s at the Andrews.
37:43
How did they evolve through that experience?
37:45
Just to have fun.
37:50
Fun?
37:50
Yeah.
37:51
What is your idea of fun?
37:53
Whatever is fun at the moment!
37:55
[Laughs] Just looking at the world around me and having my
37:58
mind blown away every time I look at it in new and different ways.
38:05
Heck, when you are an entomologist, you can have your mind blown
38:07
a different way every day.
38:10
It’s probably better than drugs.
38:11
I don’t do drugs, but it’s probably a hell of a lot better than drugs.
38:15
Did you spend a lot of time on the site down there?
38:17
Oh yeah.
38:17
Oh yeah.
38:18
Where did you stay when you did that?
38:20
Well, sometimes I basically lived in my VW bus.
38:25
Just camping where ever I was doing research, and many times
38:29
I stayed in the facilities, the smelly, old grubby, old trailers.
38:35
So, it all depended on what particular research I was doing at the time and
38:40
whether I was there for a week at a time or a day at a time, that sort of thing.
38:46
Did you tend to have a lot of interaction with other people at the site there, or
38:50
was that more commonly at these meetings?
38:52
I think to a certain extent you do have a lot of interaction, even though I’m
38:58
rather shy, and I certainly don’t go out of my way to find that interaction.
39:01
But, I would say, even under those circumstances, you do have a lot of
39:05
interaction, just because you’re there.
39:08
You see somebody drive in with some strange looking equipment
39:11
in their car, and you think, “What in the world is he doing?”
39:14
Did you have some favorite place for staying?
39:18
I’m assuming you would put your VW bus close to where you were
39:22
doing your work.
39:23
Do you have some favorite locations on the Andrews?
39:26
Not necessarily, I just did all sorts of neat spots.
39:34
All sorts of neat spots.
39:34
Do you have any recreational activities besides the research you are doing here?
39:36
I have no life.
39:38
I just do science.
39:39
I have no real life.
39:41
That is your recreational pursuit?
39:42
Regrettably so, yeah.
39:47
I was curious,
39:50
when you were not at the Andrews, if you had any interaction at all with
39:54
people in Blue River or McKenzie Bridge or the larger McKenzie Valley.
40:03
I would say no.
40:06
I would say no, because until recently,
40:13
any interaction you would have with, with “Joe six-pack,” you would have
40:21
to be careful you weren’t shot.
40:24
Sure, they knew you were a scientist studying biodiversity or ecology.
40:28
I mean, you would be shot, beaten up, whatever.
40:34
I mean, it wouldn’t be safe.
40:37
Did you have any experiences that were directly threatening to you?
40:41
Not particularly.
40:42
They were just kind of a general feeling?
40:44
Oh yeah.
40:48
But, you wouldn’t say that there was a sense of pride in what
40:51
was happening in the Andrews
40:55
in the local community there?
40:55
I couldn’t comment on it one way or the other, but I assume that, to a
41:01
large extent, the local community is made up of two sets of people.
41:07
The people who commute in and out from their second houses, and come out on
41:10
the weekends from Eugene, and they may be tree huggers, and they would
41:14
probably like what we were doing.
41:17
But most of the people living there would see most of what we were
41:20
doing at that time as negative.
41:23
I don’t know what the perception is now.
41:26
I think it’s probably not as bad now.
41:29
And personally, I find when I address people, that the most receptive
41:34
audiences to the kinds of things I talk about, are people in industry.
41:42
By that I mean a lot of the blue-collar workers themselves.
41:46
Oh yeah, they love it.
41:47
I mean, they are out in the forest all the day.
41:50
They appreciate their environment far more than do the people in the cities.
41:58
They obviously feel threatened by certain things when societal ethics change up and
42:03
down from day-to-day and month-to-month.
42:05
But, I have never had any problems.
42:08
Such a thing as knowledge, from
42:12
that group, you wouldn’t feel threatened?
42:13
No, no.
42:15
Is that the group you were talking about feeling threatened about?
42:16
Yeah, I would say so.
42:18
Okay, so things have changed in the last ten years.
42:19
Oh yeah.
42:20
I think people now understand
42:25
a lot better.
42:32
Well, I don’t know what people understand.
42:34
I won’t even answer that question.
42:35
That’s okay.
42:35
Because in the real world, there is still no communication between one end of the
42:43
spectrum and the other, in the press.
42:46
Once you get out of the press and confrontational situations, and you
42:51
talk to people, then you find there is not really much of a problem.
42:57
But in the press, which is the way everybody starts their
43:02
conversations, it’s still completely polarized and no middle ground.
43:12
How does this compare with your involvement with people from the district
43:15
[Blue River] or the national forest [Willamette] ? How would you characterize
43:20
levels of interaction with each group?
43:21
You can talk a little bit of the importance of integration
43:24
of retention management as well.
43:27
Certainly, I am asked to
43:33
speak, and it seems like it is a lot more frequent than it is.
43:35
But I suppose, I am asked to speak anywhere between half a dozen and a dozen
43:41
times a year for management; either in an educational format to teach other
43:51
managers why I think the way I do, or why the Andrews crew thinks the way it does.
43:58
And as just simple entertainment, like camp fire programs
44:05
and the rest of that stuff.
44:06
So, it all depends on the situation, but they have treated me royally,
44:16
far better than they should have, considering the amount of
44:21
science and originality in what I do.
44:27
They probably shouldn’t listen to me as much as they do.
44:30
You are invited to ranger districts?
44:34
Yeah, and other places, too.
44:42
Probably during the course of the last five years, I have lectured and given
44:48
my song-and-dance, the soil biodiversity one, basically, probably to more than
44:54
1000 managers in the Pacific Northwest and B.C., and northern California.
45:01
We have huge workshops all the time,
45:06
anywhere from 20-30 people to 300-400 at a time.
45:10
They invite me to speak and talk about these things, and people
45:15
lap it up, which is great.
45:20
When you say we, you are talking about other people in the Andrews group?
45:24
Not people associated with the Andrews.
45:27
At the moment, I usually do
45:32
things with Elaine Ingham, who’s also in soils and food-web biology.
45:36
She doesn’t work that much at the Andrews per se, but when she and her
45:41
husband initially came to campus, I tried to get them involved in the Andrews,
45:45
and they did to a certain extent.
45:47
Russ hasn’t because his money is basically agricultural, but
45:50
Elaine, being soft-money, has spent a lot working at the Andrews.
45:56
She helps out the Andrews folks tremendously.
45:59
And so, I interact with her under those circumstances, and more lately,
46:03
we do these other things together.
46:09
Another issue here,
46:15
kind of related to this, in this kind of outreach work.
46:17
Are there places besides the Andrews that are a major focus of your research,
46:21
or sites that you gravitate to?
46:22
Well, in the past two to three years, I have been moving
46:29
into, I guess you might say,
46:34
a larger or more immediate arena, and that is, agricultural land.
46:43
Largely because, if I am a “bug hugger” or a natural historian, which I am, I have
46:53
come to realize through globe-trotting, how unique the Pacific Northwest is in
46:59
terms of the resources we have here, and how little touched the environment is.
47:06
But, if you look at North America in general, or any other part of the
47:09
world, it is those areas that man has converted to agriculture that
47:15
really have suffered the greatest in terms of species diversity, food-web
47:20
complexity and sustainability, and that is the real challenge.
47:25
Eighty percent of the population lives in areas where they don’t see the
47:31
natural world, and if we can do things that make people aware of the diversity
47:39
that is around them, and to be able to manage that diversity positively
47:45
for the farming community, the grazing community, the horticulture community,
47:49
the backyard gardener, etc., then we can reach a far greater audience of
47:54
people, make them aware of all the little “fuzzies, furies, slimies, and
47:59
creepy crawlies,” in their environment.
48:01
It is for that reason that I have become pretty heavily involved in
48:08
terms of research, government-sponsored research, in agricultural
48:13
areas the last several years.
48:17
That goes hand-and-glove with the work with education,
48:26
secondary and primary education.
48:28
I think that in the long run, that’s the way that we have to go.
48:33
I’m not a great scientist with a capital S. Nobody is going
48:35
to give me the Nobel Prize.
48:37
But it seems to me if I can do anything positive for all of the methane I
48:44
generate on this earth, it may be in trying to make people more aware of
48:53
the beauty and intricate-intricacy of the environment that they are in.
48:58
And logically, you don’t go the wilderness areas for that, you go to
49:03
the areas right around where people are.
49:07
And in the long run, no matter what kind of tree hugger you are, you
49:11
are still only entering the forest once every century to cut the trees.
49:16
In the Willamette Valley, you are going out there once or twice a year
49:19
to harvest crops, and you can imagine the difference in levels of disturbance
49:23
and everything else in the environment.
49:25
So, if you can actually make a difference with species diversity
49:30
in an anthropogenic environment, that’s going to be interesting.
49:36
I mean, you can go to any number of these Forest Service planning
49:37
meetings and the rest, but the forest is going to take care of itself
49:42
no matter what Andy Moldenke says.
49:45
[Laughing] But, a lot of the other land is not.
49:48
The grazing land east of the mountains is not, the farm land
49:51
west of the mountains is not.
49:52
So, I think you can make a
49:57
real difference, especially in terms of the economics of the use of that land,
50:03
while you are then preserving what you think, or what I think is important about
50:09
the biotic components of those lands, and that is the real challenge, obviously.
50:13
And that is what we have been involved in.
50:18
I gather this is a coming involvement focus of your work?
50:20
Yeah, sure.
50:21
When you get into that arena, are you dealing with a
50:25
different group of researchers?
50:29
Totally.
50:31
The only people, I think, that stay similar, are people
50:36
who had a watershed vision.
50:40
They are the people who realized everything in that landscape is
50:44
connected, and that the further downstream you are, the more
50:47
connected you are to your landscape.
50:51
The kinds of people that, ultimately, we will be more connected with than
50:57
we are now, would be people involved in the watershed group, like the
51:03
“Stream Team” and folks like that.
51:05
But, at the moment, this is a new arena, and we do most of our collaborative
51:10
work with the people in horticulture and
51:16
soil science.
51:16
Instead of working almost exclusively with the Forest Service and the BLM,
51:21
we are now spending at least half of our time working with the NRCS, which
51:26
used to be called the Soil Conservation Society, but now whatever it is now, the
51:29
Natural Resource Conservation Service.
51:31
It is
51:36
interesting to me, because my background in agricultural history, and my goal, too,
51:47
was to explore agricultural development in the valley here, how communities
51:47
moved in different directions.
51:48
Do you
51:56
have
52:00
any examples of people moving that direction?
52:02
I am assuming Stan Gregory is one of the people.
52:05
I would assume that Stan, or the group.
52:09
I mean, just because Stan has the loudest mouth doesn’t [laughing] mean that
52:12
there aren’t other people in the group.
52:14
I like Stan, but I am thinking of people in the EPA, and more importantly,
52:23
I suppose Corvallis is a hot bed for eco-activism to a certain extent, because
52:29
of the Willamette River, because of the Mary’s River, and I think in the next ten
52:34
years there is going to be a tremendous
52:40
interplay between a number of different groups.
52:42
First, in the public and in the government regulatory agencies,
52:46
and in the university in
52:51
respect to landscape management, and this whole notion of the
52:54
Willamette Valley as a whole.
52:56
And so, I don’t think that it’s really Stan Gregory and the
53:01
Stream Team at the Andrews Forest.
53:03
I think it is a much larger group of people.
53:07
But again, I think what makes that larger group possible, is historically the fact
53:14
that there has been a very good Stream Team at the Andrews, and those people,
53:21
primarily Jim Sedell, have broadened their perspective and interacted with
53:29
far more groups in the public and other government agencies, and have brought
53:35
this whole broader perspective into view.
53:40
So again, the Andrews is probably seminal in that whole process, yet it is not
53:48
really the center of that process, but it is what developed those collaborations.
53:53
It is what developed those viewpoints, which have been sold, if you
53:58
wish, to the community-at-large.
54:00
That is the value of the Andrews right there; it’s that kind of thing.
54:03
There may be other little historical threads that you weave into that,
54:06
which I, as a non-stream person, don’t know, but the fact that the Andrews
54:13
Forest existed, probably had a good deal to do with the fact that the
54:19
EPA built this building in Corvallis.
54:21
Which then, has a lot to do with the fact that the public-at-large is
54:26
very interested in a number of these interdisciplinary environmental concerns.
54:34
And all of these things get traced back,
54:39
all of these alternate universes and what not, to the past.
54:41
If somebody hadn’t been there 30 years ago, it would be different now.
54:45
So,
54:48
the collaborative effort on the ecosystem management ethic at the Andrews, is
54:56
basically diffusing into other areas.
54:57
I assume so.
54:58
Now, you’re the historian, you’ll have to tell, but I assume that is the case.
55:02
And because of the Andrews Forest being a premier, if not the premier
55:11
integrative environmental entity around, everybody has looked forward.
55:17
Many of these other organizations would never have gotten started
55:22
in this part of the country, or they’d never be funded once they
55:28
were here.
55:30
The point about the EPA is interesting.
55:30
I hadn’t heard much.
55:30
I have no idea about the politics of how it was here.
55:33
It probably has to do with the fact that certain senators and
55:36
governors, that sort of thing.
55:38
But I suspect part of it, and part of the success of that EPA office, has
55:47
been because of that legacy at OSU.
55:50
Of
55:53
that integrated work, I guarantee you.
55:56
Are there people that you work with at the EPA?
56:00
Yeah.
56:00
I work primarily with Paul Rygiewicz and Dave Tingey in
56:04
their global change program.
56:04
Dave Tingey?
56:04
Dave Tingey, yeah.
56:14
But, they have been very interested in global climate change and conifer
56:19
forests, and of course, most people don’t realize it, but you can take it
56:24
from me as gospel, that what happens in the fall is really what drives what
56:27
happens anywhere else in the ecosystem.
56:30
And, of course, they then wanted to talk with us about it, and have
56:34
us do research with them about what might in fact be happening as you
56:39
change these variables in the soil.
56:41
When did that collaboration start?
56:44
That started about three years ago now, three-and-a-half years ago.
56:49
And they supported a graduate student,
56:53
a Ph.D. student, collaboratively between me and the EPA.
56:55
Who is that?
56:56
That’s Nancy Bowmeister.
56:57
Okay.
56:59
Yeah, Nancy.
57:03
But again, it’s fun because it’s interactive
57:08
and
57:26
interdisciplinary.
57:28
I wanted to ask you if you could just comment on how you might
57:31
characterize your levels of involvement in the decision-making
57:33
process governing the LTER?
57:36
Zero.
57:38
Do you tend to go to the meetings?
57:40
I did for a number of years when my life wasn’t totally, ridiculously, complex.
57:45
But, now, I don’t even have time to go to sleep at night, let alone go to meetings.
57:52
I always do what I do because it interests me, and I figure if
57:56
other people are interested in it, they will come talk to me.
57:59
I think the only, if there is one down side to the Andrews and LTERs,
58:06
how they work and all the rest of this, everybody probably has their pet
58:10
downsides, but from my perspective, my training and research over 30-40 years
58:18
now, it has been that too much of the funding of an LTER, no matter what
58:24
LTER, is driven by what is politically-correct at the moment,
58:28
“scientifically politically-correct,” and so many of the fundamental processes
58:38
don’t get attention……
58:38
…Which is one of the things we laughed initially at the LTER, for
58:43
not being interested in anything but primary productivity of Douglas-fir.
58:47
A lot of those fundamental processes like, herbivory, like pollination,
58:51
like seed predation, all these very fundamental things that are important
58:58
in any ecosystem in the world, have never ever been looked at simply,
59:02
because they’re not politically-correct at the moment, so there is no way you
59:06
could ever get them funded by NSF.
59:09
Now, that is not a fault of the Andrews team in placing priorities,
59:15
it’s not the fault of the NSF in setting priorities, because those
59:21
are set by the community-at-large.
59:24
It is only sort of regrettable in the sense that NSF can’t commit more of a base
59:31
fund to each one of those LTER sites to do some of the basic, boring, descriptive
59:39
cataloging of information that really is important if you are going to compare
59:46
one ecosystem to another in the country.
59:51
Until the last four or five years, there’s really been practically
59:54
no cross-site LTER work.
59:59
Now that is changing, and there is funding for that.
1:00:02
But again, it is funding for the high profile, PC sorts of things,
1:00:09
so that is really the only fundamental flaw with the system,
1:00:15
at least as I would look at it.
1:00:18
It is sort of frustrating and I am sure that everybody in every field would say
1:00:24
about their own little thing, that there are certain important things that you
1:00:27
need to quantify in order to understand systems across the world, and there is no
1:00:32
money for basic, boring data-gathering.
1:00:36
And, you always have to
1:00:41
couch whatever it is you are interested in these other terms.
1:00:45
You do that other research for the reasons of doing that other
1:00:49
research, and the information you then assemble is on the side.
1:00:59
In general, what might you ideally want to research, but is not always
1:01:03
possible because of the funding?
1:01:05
That’s right, but that’s true of any kind of research anywhere.
1:01:09
But, I think that it is a fundamental law of the way that LTER system was set up.
1:01:13
I don’t think there is any solution to it, but I think it is still a
1:01:18
fundamental flaw, and I am sure everybody regardless of their
1:01:24
discipline, probably feels the same way.
1:01:29
Just as an example, one of the unique things about the Andrews relative
1:01:34
to other LTERs, is there is this little book on all of the critters
1:01:38
that live in the Andrews Forest.
1:01:42
It is held up as this wonderful example because it’s a list of
1:01:46
4000 things that live there.
1:01:49
But there has never been a single project to actually go out and
1:01:55
catch things and document things, for any reason or another.
1:01:59
These are all things that were collected incidentally, because of other
1:02:03
individual research projects, and they are all wrapped together at the end.
1:02:08
You slap a cover on it and say, here’s the list.
1:02:10
There are 4000 things there.
1:02:13
What does that mean?
1:02:13
Does that mean there are 4000?
1:02:16
Does it mean there are 8000?
1:02:17
Does it mean there are 40,000?
1:02:17
Nobody has any knowledge, but when you look at any other part of North
1:02:22
America -- Canada, United States, Mexico -- it’s probably one of the best
1:02:28
documented sites for what lives there, certainly one of the top three or four.
1:02:34
And yet, there has never been any research on it.
1:02:37
It’s just accidental, and it just sort of comes out.
1:02:40
And a lot of the science and what I think are some of the most important
1:02:46
science and generalizations and realizations, sort of happen that way.
1:02:53
They happen by accident because things have to be driven by what
1:02:58
is politically-correct in the science community -- capital S,
1:03:02
capital C -- at any given moment.
1:03:07
I think that’s probably what makes the Andrews so unique, is that they have
1:03:11
been able to come to those fundamental realizations a lot easier than most
1:03:18
other interdisciplinary groups.
1:03:19
And I think it is just an artifact of personality.
1:03:23
I don’t know if anyone else that you’d interview would say this, but I would
1:03:28
certainly say that 80% of that credit goes to Art McKee, because he is the
1:03:36
one element who is really responsible for the way different people talk to
1:03:44
one another in different disciplines.
1:03:47
He is what holds, he is the glue that holds it together.
1:03:52
I can’t say enough
1:03:57
for that role, and I think that is what makes the Andrews successful - McKee.
1:04:01
Any insight into what puts him in that position?
1:04:03
Or personality?
1:04:05
No.
1:04:07
I am a hermit, I don’t know how people work.
1:04:08
All I can say is that it seems to me, that is what makes the Andrews work.
1:04:12
And I don’t think he ever gets any credit for that, because all he gets
1:04:16
is shit for everything that goes wrong.
1:04:18
A little bit here and a little bit there, but I don’t think people really sit back
1:04:22
and say what really makes that work.
1:04:25
I’m not saying that it is all Art, there are other people,
1:04:28
obviously, that have been involved.
1:04:29
But I think that perhaps the most crucial element long term
1:04:35
has been Art.
1:04:37
How would you characterize his role in comparison to someone else, like
1:04:38
Jerry Franklin or Fred Swanson?
1:04:39
They are very different people.
1:04:44
Jerry is an empire-builder.
1:04:47
That is what he is more interested in,
1:04:51
once he learns his science, and I don’t argue anything about how smart
1:04:57
he is, how good he is at learning things, and how good his experiments
1:05:01
are, or his observations are.
1:05:03
Perfect.
1:05:04
I can’t argue that at all.
1:05:06
But still, he is not the kind of person that joins people together that easily
1:05:12
from totally different disciplines.
1:05:14
He is good at it, but he does it on a different level.
1:05:20
And Fred again, is just this wonderful, nice guy, and he is extremely receptive
1:05:27
to everybody’s ideas and personalities.
1:05:31
And I think like Art, he has been very critical, especially these
1:05:37
last years, when Fred has been in charge, because that is when the
1:05:42
politics has been the hardest, too.
1:05:45
I mean you never know from week-to-week whether the Andrews will continue, but,
1:05:51
it gets worse and worse politically, but I think that the challenges that Fred
1:05:58
has faced are very different than the challenges that Jerry faced, which are
1:06:04
different than the challenges before that.
1:06:09
One last question.
1:06:16
Maybe you could comment on how you might characterize the effectiveness of the
1:06:21
Andrews group collectively in conveying information about what they are doing
1:06:26
and the success of the Andrews’ program.
1:06:30
All you have to do is look at the world around you.
1:06:35
Almost everything that people are talking about now in terms of ecology,
1:06:43
biology, ecosystems, everything.
1:06:50
There are few seminal events and seminal areas.
1:06:57
When you think
1:07:00
you are at the middle of things, you think it revolves around you.
1:07:04
But I think it has to do largely with
1:07:11
the first pictures from space of the planet Earth, then
1:07:18
Rachel Carson and all of the different historical trends that went into making
1:07:23
what she said acceptable when she said it.
1:07:28
A lot of that has to do with people like my dad, but when you look at
1:07:35
what’s happened, and the people who have been the movers and the shakers
1:07:39
in the past ten years, and where people have actually got something done, and
1:07:43
implemented, not just talked about in the newspapers, but actually done – it
1:07:49
has been in the western United States.
1:07:51
And 85-90%
1:07:55
of the science and the politics and the hard work of actually convincing
1:08:00
people, and probably the hard work brow-beating them as well, has been
1:08:06
generated by the Andrews group.
1:08:09
Including the managers, and I mean, including those managers.
1:08:15
Just look at the United States.
1:08:19
Everything west of Denver.
1:08:22
Almost all of that is government land, and it is now managed today in a completely
1:08:28
different way than ten years ago.
1:08:34
That is due to the Andrews Forest crew.
1:08:37
And,
1:08:40
the perception of the public throughout the country is greatly changed, and
1:08:47
I mean, a lot of that, I’ll admit it.
1:08:48
Jacques Cousteau and folks like that.
1:08:52
A lot of it is the incredible intelligence and personality of the
1:08:58
people involved in the Andrews Forest, and each person has a different gift.
1:09:04
Jerry’s obviously has been with Washington, but many other people have
1:09:11
worked in other arenas, and it just blows my mind away how powerful that group is.
1:09:19
I mean, you think about it, it’s scary, that this little group of people, I
1:09:24
mean, we are all weird people, and that so many of our ideas and concepts
1:09:31
have gone out there, been chewed around in the public for better or worse,
1:09:36
and have actually been implemented.
1:09:38
That’s scary.
1:09:42
It’s going to have a longer effect, probably than me and the rest of
1:09:45
those folks, who have a big effect for a little bit, but I think
1:09:55
it is very important.
1:09:57
Here again on a political horse, I think it is a very, very important that the
1:10:02
people at the Andrews Forest, and none of us have any time for this, to broaden
1:10:07
their interactions with the public now.
1:10:11
Get into education, especially in primary and secondary schools.
1:10:16
And at least through the Cascade Center, establish certain mechanisms, either
1:10:23
through the web or through hiring people who take traveling shows around.
1:10:29
But, I think the opportunity is there, and people need to act on that.
1:10:38
I think we can pat ourselves on the back on what we have done in other arenas.
1:10:43
But I think there is still a tremendous area where we could have an immense
1:10:47
effect for different reasons, and I think that is in the educational arena.
1:10:54
I would like to see the Cascade Center have far, far more impact in that
1:11:01
area, than it has had historically.
1:11:16
Certainly, there are other sites where there are quirky scientists
1:11:21
working together on things.
1:11:23
What is your perception about why this group has had unusual impact?
1:11:28
Random luck.
1:11:30
Why is that?
1:11:31
Pure, plain chance.
1:11:35
Again, I think it has to do with the right people having the right
1:11:38
personalities at the right time.
1:11:40
Random chance.
1:11:42
You needed people like Jerry, you needed people like Fred, you
1:11:47
needed people like Art etc., etc. At those particular times they were
1:11:56
there.
1:11:56
Who knows, five years from now, what kind of person are you going to need and
1:12:01
whether that person is going to be there.
1:12:02
Well, who knows if the Andrews will be there
1:12:08
in five years?
1:12:08
But, I don’t think you can predict these things, in the future, what
1:12:11
kind of person you will need.
1:12:13
I think you have to seize on whatever the perceived role the Andrews Forest
1:12:20
can play at a given time and just run with it, and then see what happens.
1:12:25
That’s why I am saying we need more emphasis on education.
1:12:30
We need more emphasis on getting the public involved.
1:12:34
We have done a magnificent job with science, managers,
1:12:39
politics and flag-waving.
1:12:45
Now, we need to go out and include the public in that as
1:12:50
well – in a different way than
1:12:53
we have done it in the past.
1:12:53
Sounds like what you’re saying, also, well, the Andrews is 50 years
1:12:57
old, and that this blind luck your talking about is relatively recent?
1:13:01
I would say so.
1:13:04
I would think before the ‘70’s, it was just another place that did its thing.
1:13:10
And I don’t say that in any way [laughing] derogatory, even though I
1:13:17
chuckle about it from time-to-time.
1:13:20
It had a different role at that time, and probably at that time, it was
1:13:24
doing wonderful things in its own way.
1:13:28
I just didn’t participate in them, and so, I can’t speak to it.
1:13:34
In terms of the physical site itself, from what you say here,
1:13:39
it was a good place to work.
1:13:40
Does it strike you as that Andrews site itself is it an unusual place?
1:13:48
No.
1:13:49
Nothing unusual about it at all other than the fact that it had a little
1:13:52
more old growth than most other places.
1:13:55
And if you actually start looking at the other microbiome habitats that are in the
1:14:02
close vicinity, it’s got a good share of them, but again, the nice thing in the
1:14:09
past five to ten years has been the fact that people have taken their research
1:14:17
focus away from just the Lookout Creek watershed.
1:14:22
Once you do that, my God, you’ve got the Three Sisters out there, you’ve got the
1:14:26
Pacific Coast, you’ve got more geography, more biology, and more ecosystems,
1:14:32
within a stone’s throw of the Andrews, than you could have at another major
1:14:37
research site anywhere in the country.
1:14:40
And people have just barely started to milk that and to use that.
1:14:46
But it’s right there.
1:14:47
I mean it’s just right there.
1:14:50
Geographic location
1:14:54
and general context of being in the west.
1:15:00
And it has had the potential, it still has the potential, to work closer with other
1:15:06
academic groups, Eugene for instance.
1:15:10
Eugene early on, had a much larger role in the Andrews than it does now.
1:15:15
I mean, the U of O. And there is very little collaboration between Washington
1:15:22
State [University] and the HJA.
1:15:24
And of course, the collaboration with UW is really just Jerry Franklin.
1:15:33
Plus or minus, so there exist potentials for considerable more
1:15:41
academic research with a capital R
1:15:47
than currently takes place, but even so, the hallmark of the Andrews is
1:15:55
its openness for different ideas and the ease to which people from other
1:16:03
enter the Andrews community.
1:16:03
Institutions can sort of just mingle right in and join and find their own place.
1:16:07
It’s amazing.
1:16:08
But, if you are looking for some other things that might help it, I would
1:16:12
say again, would be more emphasis from perhaps other centers like that.
1:16:17
That wouldn’t hurt.
1:16:20
What you were saying earlier that focus on education, and more public involvement.
1:16:25
How does that relate to an effort to build more popular support for the kind of work?
1:16:30
What next?
1:16:30
Well, I think that is always useful, because, I mean all of us scientists
1:16:33
are parasites on society, right?
1:16:36
I mean, we only get our money to do research through the largesse of society,
1:16:41
so we always have to educate society that what we are doing is worthwhile and
1:16:49
heck, we got to do that one way or the other.
1:16:52
Doesn’t hurt.
1:16:54
And again, one of the things that the Andrews has done is that a lot of what
1:16:59
you see out there, the physical plant and everything else, is because McKee
1:17:04
and Swanson and Franklin have gone out of their way to talk to representatives,
1:17:10
talk to senators, talk to governors, etc. And if they hadn’t done that, a lot
1:17:15
of what you see would never be there.
1:17:19
Again, of course, usually academics never deal with that kind of stuff.
1:17:23
So, they have done a good job on that and probably have to
1:17:27
continue to do that even more.
