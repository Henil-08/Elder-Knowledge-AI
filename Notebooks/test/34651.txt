00:00
This is an interview with Tim Schowalter taking place on November
00:04
18, 1997, at 1 o’clock in the afternoon in his office at Cordley Hall.
00:08
Interviewer is Max Geier.
00:24
You’ve been to the meetings and have probably seen a little
00:26
bit about this project and what we are doing here, correct?
00:29
I’ve only been to one a few months ago.
00:30
It was the last one I have been to, I guess.
00:33
I haven’t heard any updates that you may have given in the last couple of months.
00:36
Okay, because I did actually a fairly lengthy discussion last time.
00:41
So, let me just briefly encapsulate.
00:44
What I am doing here is interviewing people here in relation to their
00:47
involvement with the Andrews group and with the LTER program.
00:51
I am looking for professional networks, and how people are drawn into the group
00:57
as well as how they communicate outside the group as it relates to the science.
01:08
I was talking to Jack Lattin, and he identified you as someone I should
01:10
talk to as a key figure involved in LTER activities at the H.J. Andrews,
01:15
and also, the international LTER.
01:19
Maybe you could start out by talking a little bit about the origins
01:23
of your collaboration with Jack and other people at the Andrews.
01:26
I’m talking maybe about your personal origins and backgrounds leading up to it.
01:30
So, before I was actually at the Andrews?
01:34
Yes, even before.
01:36
Colleges you went to, why you went there, and programs you
01:40
were interested in at the time.
01:40
Well, I got my master’s degree at New Mexico State, back there in the
01:44
International Biological Program, what a lot of people called the IBP,
01:49
which was the forerunner of the LTER program in the sense it was the first
01:55
international effort to document and compare community structures
02:02
and ecosystems around the world.
02:05
It was during that time, I don’t know how much you’ve heard about
02:08
the IBP program, so I don’t need to repeat what you already have on that.
02:15
A fair amount.
02:15
I’ve been dealing with Ted Dyrness.
02:18
My involvement goes back to the IBP days.
02:20
I did a lot of the small mammals, vegetation, and pitfall studies.
02:25
I did it all back in the Jornada, which is one of the current LTER sites, a
02:30
desert LTER site [New Mexico] . And then, went on to the University of
02:35
Georgia where I did my dissertation at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, which
02:39
was at the end of the IBP program.
02:39
It was terminating at that point and NSF was developing at that time what
02:41
were the ecology programs at NSF,
02:53
what became the Ecosystem Studies program that was developing at that time at NSF.
03:01
So, there were several of us.
03:02
Kermit Cromack went through that program as well.
03:07
At Georgia?
03:08
At Georgia.
03:08
Coweeta is another one of the LTER sites.
03:14
So, I had experience with those two IBP sites, which subsequently became Ecosystem
03:21
Study sites, and are now LTER sites.
03:25
I had connections at that time with Tom Callahan, who was director of the
03:31
Ecosystem Studies program [NSF] , and a student of my major professor
03:37
at Georgia a few years before me.
03:39
So, some of those connections were developed early.
03:44
My major professor was Dak Crossley, who was the Co-PI
03:47
along with Wayne Swank at Coweeta
03:53
back then.
03:53
I guess my involvement with the LTER program was developing at that time.
04:00
I had met many of the people who are now involved with the LTER program at
04:04
various sites through collaborations and through meetings at that time.
04:11
We were having site reviews that included people from Hubbard Brook and the Andrews.
04:18
I have forgotten who all was on some of those review teams.
04:24
Then I went from there to Texas A & M for a couple of years, where I worked for a
04:28
post-doc on southern pine beetle research, and while I was there, the LTER program
04:34
developed at that time, back in 1980.
04:37
We actually submitted a proposal for an LTER site to work in the
04:43
mesquite system in southern Texas,
04:47
which wasn’t funded.
04:51
But I was, of course, applying for jobs, and I had sent resumes to
04:56
a number of places, mostly other ecosystem study sites, including to
05:01
Jack, here at the Andrews, to see whether there was a possibility for
05:11
employment.
05:11
That was Jack Rothacher, you mean?
05:11
No, Jack Lattin.
05:12
Jack Lattin, okay.
05:13
I had applied to work with him as a post-doc, at one point, or
05:17
asked him about opportunities for post doc research up here.
05:23
There was no opportunity for it at that time, but then a position came open here.
05:29
I, of course, would have taken a job anywhere there had been a hard-money job.
05:33
And I interviewed for several, but they didn’t come through.
05:35
So, in a way, it’s fortuitous that I did end up at a place where I could
05:40
stay involved with LTER research.
05:44
But you were getting your fingers in here interested in working with this
05:48
group before you got the position?
05:50
Right, I knew a number of the people here.
05:51
I had been acquainted with Kermit Cromack for years, and I knew Art.
05:56
Art McKee had been through Coweeta, as well.
05:59
So, there were a number of people that I had been acquainted with for some time.
06:04
I knew Jack’s name, although I think I had only met him once at a meeting
06:09
before I came up here in this job.
06:11
So, I got the position that I have now in 1981, and rather quickly
06:17
got involved with research.
06:20
I got an NSF grant to look at effects of herbivory on
06:25
Douglas-fir saplings, nutrient turnover, and related processes in 1983.
06:33
Since then, I have had projects to look at log decomposition in canopy
06:39
communities, funded through NSF.
06:43
One thing I guess I should note too, that my involvement with the international
06:48
LTER sort of started while I was at NSF.
06:51
I was the program director for Ecosystem Studies, in 92-93.
06:55
I was involved in federal development of the terrestrial ecosystem
07:01
initiatives, which have been subsequently supporting some projects.
07:06
I have been involved in some of the desertification negotiations, which kept
07:12
me close to the two desert sites that I am familiar with, the Jornada and Sevilleta.
07:19
A number of the other program officers at NSF at the time were other LTER
07:24
folks in different sites, so it is a fairly integrated community.
07:30
I met people from around the world, international programs, who were coming
07:35
in asking about our LTER sites, and of course, was promoting our LTER network
07:40
as sort of demonstration sites for some of the issues that were coming
07:46
up with respect to desertification, which was big at that time.
07:49
This includes terrestrial carbon pools, the issue that led to the
07:56
terrestrial ecosystem initiative.
07:59
The meteorologists and oceanographers can calculate to within 1.2 gigatons
08:05
how much carbon there is in various atmospheric and oceanic pools, and
08:11
they are missing 1.2 gigatons, which is about 20 percent of the global carbon
08:15
that they can account for, and they are assuming that it is terrestrial carbon.
08:23
It led to
08:26
the spin-off through the global change community to a panel I
08:31
served on that developed the Terrestrial Ecosystem Initiative.
08:34
Again, the existence of the LTER program was central to many of those discussions.
08:42
It was sort of surprising to me how relatively few people I was working
08:47
with on these various interagency committees, knew about the LTER.
08:52
It is a big NSF program that a lot of people out in other agencies, I
08:57
thought would know about, didn’t.
09:00
It was an opportunity to showcase the LTER and talk about how LTER research
09:05
was contributing to those issues.
09:09
Outside the NSF, what are the
09:17
other agencies that participated?
09:18
EPA, USDA, Department of Energy, the [U.S.] State Department was involved,
09:26
NOAA, NASA; all those committees I was on included representatives
09:32
from all of those agencies that had involvement or interest in environmental
09:39
conditions, environmental changes.
09:42
The State Department, of course, because they were the primary
09:44
negotiators of the EMSAT agreement.
09:47
What you’re saying is that as late as ‘92 or ’93, the LTER program was a
09:54
pretty well-kept a secret of the NSF?
09:56
I don’t know, it was surprising.
09:57
I would not have thought so, and I think there were people in other
10:01
agencies who knew about it, many whose positions and roles would have
10:08
benefited from knowing about the LTER, and I was surprised that they didn’t.
10:14
How widespread that is, I couldn’t tell you, but there were people when I
10:19
bring up the LTER in these committees I was serving on, it was not known to
10:26
the other members of these committees.
10:28
They were all the environmental offices for those agencies.
10:35
So, that surprised me.
10:37
Yes, that was an indication how widely known the LTER was outside NSF, and, you
10:42
know, it was pretty poor at that time.
10:48
Maybe we could back up here just a little bit.
10:49
I understand that you did your undergraduate work at Wichita State.
10:55
Are you from Kansas originally?
10:57
Yep.
10:59
What led you from Wichita State to New Mexico State?
11:04
I worked for a couple of professors at Wichita State, with two ecologists there.
11:12
The program was primarily a cellular and genetics program, but there were two
11:17
ecologists, Don Dissler, and Youngman, I don’t remember his first name.
11:21
But they took us on a field trip down to
11:26
Arizona and the Chiricahuas.
11:29
The American Museum of Natural History set a field station in
11:33
the Chiricahuas [Mountains] there.
11:35
And I got interested in the Southwest.
11:39
I applied to work at New Mexico State, and
11:45
I hadn’t heard from them for a while, and I started graduate
11:47
school, or taking graduate credits, at least, at Wichita State.
11:51
Then, I got a call from New Mexico State that they had an assistantship
11:54
available to work with Walt Whitford.
11:58
Back then, there was a number of desert IBP sites, and the
12:02
Jornada was just one of them.
12:04
There was another IBP site in Utah, I don’t remember the exact name of the
12:07
site now, but Jim MacMahon [Utah State Univ.] was the overall program leader, and
12:15
was coordinating the research at all of these desert sites.
12:18
But, Walt was the PI on the Jornada site.
12:21
So, I just very quickly got involved in Jornada research.
12:25
That is not what I ended up doing my thesis on.
12:29
I actually ended up doing my thesis on the energetics, bioenergetics
12:33
of a lepidopteran defoliator of grasslands, which was the major
12:39
economic problem in northeast and northcentral parts of New Mexico.
12:45
That was an ecosystem-level project, and I was becoming more interested
12:51
in sort of ecosystem-level questions,
12:56
and then subsequently moved on to the University of Georgia, where I had
13:01
originally been interested in [Dak] Crossley’s work on grasshopper energetics.
13:07
One or two of his students had done some work on grasshopper energetics.
13:11
But he gave me some books to read, and I was just generally reading
13:16
what was going on in the area, the Coweeta in particular, since there was
13:20
no money to do some research there.
13:25
Interestingly enough, I walked into Dak’s office and said, from having
13:29
read the Coweeta proposal and a lot of other literature from the projects
13:33
that it appeared that nobody had really looked at the effects of canopy
13:38
arthropods on nutrient turnover.
13:41
Dak just laughed.
13:42
I knew I’d stepped in it.
13:44
That is exactly what he wanted me to do.
13:48
So, I got my first taste of canopy research at Coweeta, and that is
13:54
something that has been followed up here.
13:58
Since ‘91, actually since before I went to NSF, I have been also
14:02
working at the Luquillo LTER site, doing similar research on canopy
14:07
arthropod responses to Hurricane Hugo.
14:10
Oh, okay.
14:11
In Puerto Rico then?
14:11
Yes.
14:12
And I also went back to Mexico, back in 90-91 for a year of leave.
14:19
I was working in the Jornada again, looking at arthropod
14:20
responses to moisture gradients.
14:20
So,
14:26
returning to your roots.
14:29
So, my background at this point spans, I guess, six US LTER sites, because I
14:36
have a log study at the Andrews here in Oregon, and also at Cedar Creek,
14:42
an LTER site in Minnesota, Konza LTER in Kansas, and Coweeta, again.
14:47
So, I have got Andrews, Cedar Creek, Konza, Coweeta, Jornada, and Luquillo.
14:54
That was all before you went to the NSF?
14:58
Right, yeah.
15:00
And I guess you had asked about involvement in the international LTER?
15:04
Jim Gosz, who is the current, or was the recent executive director
15:09
for the LTER network, was division director of NSF while I was
15:14
there, or came while I was there.
15:19
I guess working with Jim was good, but I was thinking one time how many
15:25
of the division directors were LTER alumni, and how many of them I knew.
15:31
It was a rather impressive list.
15:34
You found yourself in familiar company there.
15:35
Right.
15:36
So, when they were developing the international LTER network
15:40
[ILTER] , I had been at NSF, I was familiar with a lot of national and
15:44
international policy development, and my name came up a few times.
15:48
So, I was invited to join the delegation to Hungary.
15:53
I was part of the ILTER
15:57
delegation that went to Hungary in
16:01
‘94 and ‘95, and have also been invited to be a delegate to the East Asia and Pacific
16:06
Region LTER meeting in Taiwan in ‘95.
16:14
Go back a little bit again here.
16:21
You majored in biology and anthropology, and chemistry too.
16:27
Can you identify the point where you moved more into the
16:31
biology program in New Mexico?
16:34
Was there a reason for that?
16:36
Yeah.
16:37
I was interested in anthropology, and continue to be.
16:40
Human effects and human interactions with the environment, continues
16:44
to be a major interest of mine.
16:46
Now, of course, we are looking more at the human influences on ecosystems, but there
16:51
are times in our not so distant past, when we were much more dependent on the
16:56
ecosystem resources that were available.
16:59
As an anthropology major, I focused on Native Americans [indigenous]
17:04
and Africans, and how their cultures reflected the availability of
17:11
resources, the development of their economic systems based on those
17:14
resources, their agricultural or trade use of those resources, and so on.
17:21
Biology, though, goes back longer.
17:24
I had been interested in biology since I was a kid, and my parents encouraged me to
17:29
collect insects, leaves, rocks, fossils.
17:32
[Laughs] I had a collection for just about everything.
17:36
I could bring snakes or frogs home, and nobody panicked.
17:40
Even my mom would help me fix something up to keep them for a while, and
17:45
then they usually encouraged me
17:49
to let things go, too.
17:52
So, my parents were good at nurturing an appreciation for biology.
17:58
Were they involved with science at all?
18:00
No, my dad was an aeronautical engineer, trained as an electrical engineer,
18:04
but he designed the tail section for the 747, among other things.
18:10
He also was instrumental in developing flight simulators
18:14
for most of the Boeing planes.
18:16
So, I saw the computer era develop.
18:19
And when the first computer games, the first Atari’s came out, I had seen
18:22
those things, those same set-ups and designs in flight simulators at Boeing.
18:28
So, it was interesting to see how the technology spread from there.
18:33
But biology was just always a love.
18:36
I actually did start out as a math major at Wichita State, but
18:40
changed eventually to biology.
18:42
Then I added anthropology as I went, because I got interested in it, and
18:48
I almost added geology at one point.
18:50
I had the good sense to not pursue it for a degree.
18:58
I would have been a student forever, and at one point, probably would
19:01
have been, except I got a notice from the College of Liberal Arts and
19:04
Sciences, that it was time for me to graduate, that I had enough hours.
19:10
[Laughs]
19:10
I
19:12
was curious how you made the move to New Mexico on the basis of
19:19
your experience in the Southwest.
19:22
You mentioned your advisor at Wichita State.
19:24
Were
19:26
there any particular people there that you might identify as mentors or role models?
19:30
At Wichita State?
19:32
Don Dissler, who clearly has been the mentor that meant a lot to me.
19:37
I took four classes under him, and he was a person that was very
19:41
interested in learning himself.
19:43
When he found out that there were four or five of us, who had
19:45
been taking his classes and who were interested in entomology,
19:49
he offered an entomology class.
19:51
By training, he was a fish ecologist, so this was quite a departure for him, but
19:57
he stayed probably a lecture ahead of us,
20:01
took some nice field trips, and learned a lot of entomology.
20:06
And, just somebody to hang around.
20:13
He just spent a lot of time with us, and talked about his training and
20:16
background, what got him into biology.
20:19
Just somebody who just really loved being outdoors and studying ecology.
20:23
I had great field trips with him.
20:25
We would just go and pitch our tents at a field site, and all be out there together.
20:32
There was a group of probably five or six of us that just interacted
20:36
very closely with Dissler.
20:39
He had employed me for a year as a research assistant.
20:46
So, I had some experience working in the lab, and going out in the field collecting
20:52
primarily small mammal and invertebrate samples for tissue analysis as part of
20:59
an impact assessment study on a new, coal-fired power plant in Topeka, Kansas.
21:07
They were burning sulfur heavy coal and the primary objective of this project,
21:13
it was an EPA supported study, was to see how the new scrubbers being
21:19
installed at that time, would cut down on the sulfur emissions and effects
21:24
on ecosystems around the power plant.
21:27
We were taking samples in various cardinal directions, up wind and down wind, and
21:34
collecting small mammal and arthropods.
21:36
My part of it was collecting small mammal and arthropod samples for population
21:40
estimation, and also tissue analysis for heavy metals and sulfur, primarily.
21:50
You mentioned the field trip and the subsequent move to New Mexico.
21:55
I’m not sure if I haven’t been listening, maybe you already mentioned this,
22:01
but did you identify anybody at New Mexico who might be on the order of
22:04
possibly a guide for your future career?
22:07
Yeah, clearly Wickford.
22:09
I’ve continued to be associated with Wickford over the years.
22:12
It’s just amazing how our paths continue to cross.
22:16
He took a sabbatical to Georgia while I was a student there, so I
22:18
got to introduce him to Crossley, and all the other folks there.
22:22
And he got interested in mites at the time.
22:24
So, Crossley was an oribatid mites specialist, and now
22:28
Wickford is working with mites.
22:30
It’s gotten to be a real tight knit group again of people who have just
22:35
moved around, worked in different places.
22:38
So, you kept in touch with people over the years?
22:41
Yeah, and I’m continuing to co-author papers with him, and also with Crossley.
22:46
The association has stayed pretty close among all three of us.
22:51
Plus, my post-doc supervisor, Bob Coleson, at Texas A&M, was a
22:56
product of that Coweeta guild, too.
22:59
And although his work at Texas A&M has focused on southern pine beetle, he
23:05
has approached it from an ecosystem perspective, so my association with
23:10
him sort of continued to reinforce that
23:15
approach to looking at insects from the ecosystem perspective,
23:19
which is a fairly rare one.
23:21
There are only probably a half a dozen entomologists I know who approach their
23:26
research from an ecosystem perspective.
23:33
How you might characterize the similarities and differences between
23:38
Coweeta and the Andrews, in terms of the research you do, and the kinds
23:39
of people that were working on those sites, what your impression is?
23:46
It’s been interesting working at these sites.
23:49
There are some interesting differences.
23:51
Coweeta and the Andrews, I would characterize as being very well-balanced.
23:57
They are both a couple hours from their major institution; University
24:03
of Georgia is about a two-hour drive from Coweeta, we [OSU] are about
24:05
a two-hour drive from the Andrews.
24:08
There are a lot of similarities in how people have approached research.
24:12
There was relatively more entomological involvement at
24:16
Georgia I think than there is here,
24:22
quite a few people looking at various aspects of invertebrate ecology
24:25
at Coweeta, while I was there.
24:28
Now, there is still probably a half a dozen people looking at
24:32
aquatic and terrestrial arthropods from a variety of perspectives.
24:36
Here, it has primarily been Jack and me.
24:37
Stan Gregory over in [OSU Dept.] Fisheries and Wildlife looks at
24:44
invertebrates, but not from an entomological training standpoint.
24:54
The Jornada is an interesting one in that most people who work there come
24:58
from off-site, as the LTER developed.
25:03
There are a lot of people who have done research on the Jornada.
25:08
There are only about half a dozen people at New Mexico State that
25:11
are integrated in the LTER project.
25:14
The others are coming from places like Duke and San Diego, and other places.
25:19
And the Luquillo is similar in that there is a fairly small core group in
25:23
Puerto Rico that administers and takes care of much of the work at the site.
25:28
And there is just this huge pool of satellite investigators that
25:31
come in for their specialties.
25:33
Would those be mostly post-docs or would they be people who have appointments?
25:36
People like me, sometimes bringing post-docs
25:46
or students.
25:46
But, disciplinarily, they are all reasonably well-balanced, I guess.
25:49
I think that Coweeta and the Andrews sort of share this nucleus of investigators,
25:55
well-balanced investigators from the institutions close to them.
25:59
How would you characterize the relative interaction, across
26:04
disciplines, at the two sites?
26:07
It varies.
26:10
The best camaraderie is actually at the Luquillo, from my perspective.
26:15
People come in there, myself included.
26:18
I’m very comfortable working with that group.
26:22
And it’s ironic, because we only get together a couple times a
26:24
year, and maybe it wouldn’t work if we got together more often.
26:27
Who knows?
26:32
The other sites tend to develop subgroups that work more or less closely together.
26:38
One of the disappointments for me here has always been the relative
26:43
absence of consumer-oriented projects.
26:47
We have had a real scarcity of people working with birds and mammals, and that
26:51
consistently has been a comment that reviewers [of LTER proposals] have made.
26:59
We’ve had good entomological taxonomy
27:05
work at the Andrews through Jack Lattin’s work, but relatively little
27:09
consumer-oriented entomological work.
27:11
I’ve done pretty much what’s been done, from an insect-consumer
27:17
standpoint; how populations rise and fall, what affects that, what their
27:22
effects are on nutrient-cycling, carbon-flux, and ecosystem processes.
27:29
Do you have any theories on what might account for that?
27:32
Well, I don’t know how public I want to make that.
27:39
Several people have mentioned the same issue.
27:41
I’m
27:44
not currently directly tied to the LTER.
27:50
Some of it is just personalities.
27:53
Let me back up a little bit here again.
27:55
You’ve been at a large number of universities compared to
28:02
most people I’ve interviewed.
28:02
It’s pretty broad, spanning a career of experience, graduate level and above.
28:09
If you could give a little insight into your perception of how you might
28:13
compare and contrast the research climate at Oregon State University, and
28:16
the potential for interdisciplinary, collaborative research at the
28:18
institution, as compared to other
28:24
institutions?
28:24
That’s a little tougher one.
28:26
Well,
28:30
one of the limitations here has been a lack of institutional
28:34
support for research.
28:36
My salary here, for instance, is covered, but for as long as I have been
28:41
here, I’ve had virtually no research funding from Oregon State University.
28:47
The best I had for a while was from the Forest Science Department.
28:50
I was getting, for most of the 80’s, I was getting about $10,000 a year
28:56
for doing cone and seed insect work, which was a very-focused application
29:01
of forest entomology research.
29:05
So, the only research funding I’ve ever had to do, the ecological
29:08
research that I prefer to do, has been from outside Oregon State.
29:15
It has always been that I’ve been on this constant treadmill, getting
29:21
research grants support.
29:25
The Forest Service has begun to chip in some.
29:27
I’ve currently got funding through the Forest Service’s Demo Project,
29:32
but that isn’t for Andrews work.
29:34
The Demo sites are in Washington and southern Oregon, and sort of
29:38
span and compliment the research that I have done at the Andrews.
29:42
But NSF has been my sole supporter of research at the Andrews.
29:47
During the last funding cycle, I had support from the LTER for
29:55
canopy sampling during three of the six years, but that has been my
30:01
only support from the LTER itself.
30:04
All of my other research has been supported by other NSF grants.
30:10
When did your first grant to fund work with the Andrews come through?
30:13
1983, when I got a grant to look at the effects of herbivores on nutrient cycling.
30:21
Since then, most of my NSF support at the Andrews has been
30:23
for log decomposition research.
30:28
At other institutions, what you are saying is
30:31
that there is more institutional funding?
30:36
Well, it depends.
30:37
New Mexico State has not provided a lot of institutional support for
30:41
the Jornada [LTER site] . In fact, there have been a lot of impediments
30:43
at the institutional level to that.
30:45
While I was a student there, for instance, the College of Agriculture
30:51
took out a bunch of fences and allowed grazing on parts of the
30:55
range, and at that time, it was IBP.
30:56
But
31:00
I gather there has been sort of continuing
31:04
competition between the College of Agriculture and the LTER
31:07
project over grazing rights and various aspects of management.
31:13
With
31:16
support of the Jornada, the Agricultural Research Services,
31:20
Jornada Experimental Range support down there, I understand the LTER has
31:27
very close collaboration with the ARS.
31:30
But the College of Agriculture, I understand, is still a bit competitive.
31:37
But that is neither here nor there anyway.
31:44
The University of New Mexico has put a lot of institutional support
31:47
into the development of that site.
31:51
A lot of folks from UNM have worked down there.
31:55
I haven’t even gotten the chance to visit there, but I just understand they
31:58
do have a premier field station there.
32:01
How about in terms of faculty, campus culture, and the informal
32:06
support, such as collaborative research and stuff like that?
32:12
It’s always been a fight here.
32:15
Finally, in the last couple of years with the new department chair here, I got
32:20
some resources to upgrade my laboratory, so now I’ve added in a deionized,
32:26
distilled and ionized water system, so I don’t have to cart water back and
32:30
forth between Cordley [Hall] and my lab.
32:33
Got some new benches and counters, and it’s a much nicer
32:37
environment to work in down there.
32:41
My lab is down in the greenhouse wing across from the motor pool.
32:48
I don’t want to be too caustic here, but, part of it is the
32:54
game you play where you are.
32:55
I mean, there are trade-offs.
32:56
Where would you go?
32:58
But, it has always been a struggle to keep projects funded.
33:03
One of the continuing complaints I have is that it is very difficult to
33:09
get support for graduate students.
33:10
If I don’t have money on my grant, it isn’t there.
33:13
The only graduate students that I can support are those that I can support on
33:17
grants, because there is no institutional support for graduate students.
33:22
Who outside the entomology
33:36
program
33:40
would you identify as your closest collaborator, or colleague on campus?
33:47
Outside the entomology program.
33:47
I haven’t really worked that closely.
33:50
I guess Kermit Cromack, we’ve certainly tried a few times to get
33:58
some close collaboration.
33:59
Actually, Jeff Morrel has probably been my closest colleague in the log decomposition
34:07
research that we have been doing.
34:09
He is the mycologist down at the Forest Products Department.
34:15
We’ve shared some students in the past, and more recently now, are collaborators
34:19
on a current log decomposition project.
34:24
I am
34:27
also curious.
34:27
When you first came here in 1981, you mentioned you had contacted people
34:32
like Jack [Lattin] and Stan Gregory.
34:35
What was the primary single attraction out here?
34:39
It was a job.
34:43
I was applying for everything.
34:45
The academic job market had really started to decline precipitously the
34:51
time I came out of my Ph.D. program,
34:56
and it’s been much worse since.
34:58
But, yeah, I applied for just about everything there was in California.
35:06
[Laughs]
35:09
But you had written, or were you in the process of writing a grant for
35:12
NSF, to try to come and work here?
35:14
No.
35:15
I had been involved in preparation of several grant proposals while I was at
35:20
Texas A&M, including an attempt to get an LTER site established in south Texas.
35:25
But no, when I came up here, it was because of the job offering here
35:30
for a forest entomologist position.
35:33
Once you arrived here, it sounds to me like you were getting involved with
35:38
folks at the LTER program pretty quickly.
35:42
Can you recall when your first visit to the Andrews was?
35:48
Let me think.
35:51
I’m trying to remember whether it was Kermit [Cromack] or Dick
35:52
Waring that sent me down there.
35:54
Maybe Jerry [Franklin] ? You know, I don’t recall now who sent me down
36:03
there.
36:03
I know that I had been down there various times early on with one of them.
36:06
I don’t remember now which was the first.
36:09
Can you tell me some of your first impressions of the Andrews?
36:16
One of the things that I remember being struck by is
36:18
how similar it was to Coweeta.
36:21
I mean, if I kind of ignored the fact that the over-story was conifers instead of
36:26
oaks, the understory was very similar to Coweeta; the dogwood, rhododendron, ferns.
36:33
Walking through the understory was virtually identical to
36:36
walking through Coweeta.
36:40
Slopes are a bit steeper, but there were some steep slopes at Coweeta, too.
36:45
So yeah, I remember that was one of my first impressions, in thinking that, hey,
36:49
I can work here, this isn’t so different.
36:52
So, the potential for entomological research was promising?
36:57
Well, I was daunted by the height of the trees.
37:01
The techniques that I had used at Coweeta were mostly ground-based,
37:04
using a long-handled pole pruner
37:08
to get samples from 30-40 feet up.
37:12
Things I could reach from the ground, using the pole and any advantage, I could
37:16
get from sampling uphill on a slope.
37:20
Here, there was no possibility of that.
37:22
The lowest branches of the old-growth trees, were at least 150 feet up.
37:26
So, canopy research was pretty much out, but I did get involved initially
37:32
in some of the regenerating stands.
37:36
I worked on Watershed 6, and also Watershed 10 [HJA] ; they were two
37:41
of the sites that I focused on.
37:43
Interestingly enough, my first involvement in the canopy here
37:47
came through the lab [soils] fire.
37:50
It was at the end of the project that I had from NSF, to look at
37:55
herbivore effects on nutrient cycling.
37:58
The soils lab was doing one of my tissue analysis, with some nitrogen,
38:06
phosphorous, potassium, calcium, and there was a short in one of the ovens or
38:10
something, and it burned up the samples.
38:14
So, I had 10,000 bottles that had, you know, was how I was going to pay
38:20
for nutrient analysis, and this was towards the end of the grant, so I
38:25
had to decide how I was going to spend $10,000 on these, really quickly.
38:30
It was at the beginning of the ‘86 field season, so I called Callahan at NSF
38:40
and explained the situation with the fire, loss of the samples, and
38:44
the fact that at that time, we were having a gypsy moth scare in the
38:49
Pleasant Hill area east of Eugene.
38:53
And there were gypsy moths within about 14 air miles of the Andrews, so
38:58
there was some concern at that time about whether or not they found a gypsy
39:02
moth at the Andrews, if the climate was such that the state was committed
39:05
to eradicate it, wherever it was.
39:08
So, I was thinking, we have no information about who is living up in those
39:13
canopies, from a population standpoint.
39:16
We had had the old studies by Voegtlin, Carroll and Dennison,
39:21
that had surveyed what was living up there, and they had a species list that
39:25
they had developed from a variety of sampling techniques that gave a pretty
39:33
good picture of who was living up there, but only their relative abundances.
39:37
And it was based on four trees in one site.
39:41
So, Callahan said, “Sure, send me a proposal for what you want
39:44
to do.” I did, outlining the number of trees that I’d sample.
39:50
I had gotten some preliminary estimates of what it would cost to climb trees.
39:56
The proposal was approved, I put out a bid for climbing contracts, and ended
40:00
up hiring a group out of Eugene who had been climbing trees for years for
40:06
the Forest Service to collect cones.
40:08
That was the Glenwood Cooperative.
40:08
And Burt Recker, who
40:14
has continued to climb for me over the years now, with various associates
40:20
that have joined him over the years.
40:26
But Burt, and John Carrol, who was an associate at the time; they climbed
40:32
twelve old growth trees for me, one Douglas-fir and one hemlock in each
40:36
of six stands, five of which were log decomposition sites at that time, because
40:45
I had some idea we might be able to link the canopy and the forest floor
40:49
in those sites, and increase the amount of information that we had for them.
40:54
Then, one of the sites, I changed to Mack Creek, because there was quite a bit
40:57
of interest in having a riparian site, what was going on in the canopy of a
41:04
riparian site, which wasn’t represented among the log sites.
41:09
Anyway, that is how the canopy work here got started.
41:12
It was fortuitous, if that is what you want to call it; a lab fire that
41:18
saved me enough money to put into sampling twelve old-growth trees.
41:22
Was this just the redirecting of existing grants?
41:24
Yeah.
41:26
NSF approved that use of the funds, and I was able to find a pair of climbers
41:32
that understood and appreciated what I was trying to do, and have stayed
41:37
interested in the project enough that they have actually volunteered
41:41
in the past to climb again for free.
41:43
Got the money, you might as well get paid for this work.
41:47
But, you know, it’s been a good association.
41:49
People have been appreciative of the kinds of concerns I had in how
41:56
the sampling was done, and I think they’ve done a good job sampling.
42:00
How did you run across those people in the first place?
42:02
Just an open bid.
42:03
They were one of three groups that bid on the project, and came up with the low bid,
42:12
and it worked out well.
42:15
So now, when you write a grant, you write them into it?
42:18
Yeah.
42:21
We have become
42:25
more consistently associated, now that I have six years of Demo
42:29
support, so we’ll probably be working together more continuously.
42:34
During the last six years, it was every other year, and that
42:36
was the first time since ‘86.
42:37
A long time, between ‘86 and ’92, before I was able to get LTER
42:42
support to continue that canopy work.
42:46
It’s a funny thing, you know, everybody appreciates the fact that
42:49
species diversity and a lot of things going on in the canopy can have
42:55
major effects on canopy-atmosphere interactions, canopy-soil interactions,
42:59
but getting money for it has been difficult over the years.
43:04
It costs to climb trees.
43:09
It runs about $100 a tree.
43:13
I could learn to do it myself.
43:14
I’ve done it once down in Puerto Rico, actually, on shorter trees, but I
43:18
couldn’t sample efficiently myself.
43:20
I’d probably kill myself, eventually.
43:23
It’s better from my standpoint to hire people who have experience,
43:28
who know everything to look for, check every buckle, what
43:32
you do in case of an emergency.
43:36
I’ve had a couple students over the years who have been interested in
43:39
doing that, but weren’t trained to climb trees, and I’ve just said, “No.
43:42
It’s okay if you want to learn to climb trees in your spare time, but
43:46
don’t do it for your thesis where you are going to be obligated to learn it
43:50
quickly, be in a rush, take chances.” It’s better to have these guys
43:55
climbing and collecting samples for us.
43:57
Now, if I had a student already trained in tree climbing or mountaineering, and
44:00
wants to climb trees, I’ll say great.
44:03
Hasn’t happened.
44:05
I was going to ask you, if you’ve ever had any accidents?
44:07
No.
44:08
The only accident we had was a couple of years ago where a branch broke out
44:13
above one of the climbers, and we had to run him down to the hospital in
44:18
Roseburg for a couple of stitches.
44:21
It could have been worse.
44:22
They wear hard hats now.
44:25
I am curious about gaps in your [funding] , how you redirected your
44:31
work, or did you redirect your work?
44:32
Yeah, I mostly focused on log decomposition during that point.
44:36
And that’s something that was easier?
44:38
Yeah, working on the ground was a lot easier.
44:41
The statistical methods, the experimental designs are much more straightforward,
44:45
you don’t have to sell them as hard.
44:48
I’ve been surprised and a little disappointed by that.
44:50
You know, it’s good for me because I had training as an autecologist
44:56
while I was at Georgia, and continued to work with Mike, for instance.
45:00
I’ve had some periodic role in decomposition studies.
45:05
So, it was an area where I could sell my expertise, and also involves
45:09
very clear experimental designs.
45:11
Anything you do on the forest floor is easy to replicate, easy to manipulate.
45:17
When you get up in tree tops, you’ve got the triple whammy; difficulty
45:21
of access, difficulty of repeated measurements, getting out to the
45:26
same place without disturbing it,
45:30
and manipulation.
45:31
What can you manipulate up there?
45:34
We’ve got some new opportunities up there now with the canopy crane at Wind River
45:37
[Experimental Forest, southern Washington] . That does overcome some of those problems.
45:41
With the crane, you do have fairly complete access to virtually all the
45:46
tree crowns within the perimeter.
45:48
You can go back to the same sample points, and there are actually some possibilities
45:52
for manipulations that you could do there, if you wanted to shelter branches, impose
45:59
herbivory on particular branches, or
46:03
exclude predators of herbivores from some branches.
46:06
There are some things you can manipulate and study, using the crane.
46:09
But the climbing techniques are just too rough.
46:13
They do offer the advantage of being able to move around a lot, so, for
46:18
instance, the twelve trees that I sampled, maybe six of those were
46:21
replicated across the whole Andrews.
46:23
I mean, there were the six sites distributed around the Andrews.
46:28
So, the replication was good that way, while the crane is just one site.
46:35
I can draw conclusions about canopy arthropods from my sampling at the
46:39
Andrews that cover 6000 hectares.
46:43
Now, more recently, since I have expanded some of the sites outside of
46:46
the Andrews, I can talk about 15,000
46:50
hectares.
46:50
So, the replication is absolutely essential, where traditional
46:54
techniques, somebody climbing a tree or working some tower, there
46:57
is no possibility of replication.
47:05
People wanted to see a manipulation, so I couldn’t get funding from NSF
47:08
because I wasn’t manipulating something.
47:11
I couldn’t get it from the USDA, because at that time they didn’t
47:14
have an ecosystem program, and they more interested in growing trees
47:19
or killing insects, it seemed.
47:21
I mean, that’s putting it simplistically.
47:23
But the review comments I was getting were on, “How is this
47:26
going to benefit forestry?”
47:33
Why do we want to know about insect communities?
47:39
Were the sites that you worked on off the Andrews in the Blue River District?
47:45
They are now.
47:47
The last six years, I’ve been working in
47:53
other parts of the Blue River District, primarily.
47:56
I have several sites down around the Delta campground south of
48:00
the McKenzie River towards Cougar
48:06
[Reservoir]
48:06
. What’s the relative proportion of your work that goes on in the Andrews?
48:06
The last couple of years most of my research has been on
48:11
the Demo sites.
48:15
I’ve still got the log decomposition sites, though at the Andrews,
48:18
so it’s about half-and-half.
48:21
And the Luquillo work, I like to go down to a couple of times a year.
48:23
I’ve been up to the crane [at Wind River Experimental Forest] , done some
48:25
sampling for the crane one year, and I’m making some arrangements to do
48:30
sampling from the canopy crane in Panama.
48:34
So, I’ll have a couple tropical and a couple of temperate sites, to
48:38
compare canopy processes in the next year, which will be sort of unique.
48:47
Could you talk a little bit about your perception of
48:52
the purpose of an experimental forest in the Forest Service, in
48:56
your experience, how it changed in the time you’ve been involved here?
49:03
Yeah, you’ve probably heard this from others, too.
49:06
When these experimental forests were started, the primary interests were timber
49:11
production and water yields and quality.
49:15
During the IBP days, Hubbard Brook, Coweeta, and the Andrews became
49:19
sort of the three “crown jewels,” as they are often called, representing
49:23
the Northeast, Southeast, and Northwest primary timber areas.
49:30
The focus began to change at that time toward forest communities and how various
49:35
processes affected forest communities.
49:37
And then,
49:41
toward the end of the IBP period, people were starting to look
49:43
at effects on nutrient budgets.
49:47
That started with projects at Hubbard Brook in the ‘60’s that were
49:55
indicating effects of clearcutting on water quality and water yield.
50:00
People started to be concerned about how nutrients leach through
50:04
soils as percolation changed, as the result of canopy opening.
50:13
One of the interesting things that I talked with my students about
50:17
in the ecosystem classes, is the spin-off from the cold war research
50:24
at about the same time work that was going on at Oak Ridge and Savannah
50:26
River, and down in Puerto Rico.
50:29
The Luquillo site down there was one of the sites for the Department
50:32
of Energy research on radioactive tracer movements in ecosystems.
50:37
Odum and their associates down there were tagging trees and seeing where the
50:43
labels went, and doing similar research at Savannah River and Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
50:48
A number of people that I’ve been associated with over the years have been
50:53
involved in those radioactive tracer studies at one of those three sites.
50:57
In fact, I had some training under Crossley in radio tracer techniques
51:01
and have some early papers on that.
51:05
But, most of that research at that time was what would be the fate
51:10
of these radioactive elements, if there were a nuclear war?
51:13
How quickly would the fallout be attenuated in tree tissues or what
51:20
would eat those tree tissues, how would things get deposited in vegetation or
51:25
sediment, and what processes in the ecosystem, such as herbivory, would
51:29
tend to move those things around?
51:34
So, I think a lot of the ecosystem research that developed during the late
51:40
‘60’s was sort of a spin-off of that.
51:42
Radio tracers were an easy way to look at how these radioactive elements moved from
51:51
pool-to-pool, because you could measure the time it took for it to get from the
51:57
tree trunk to the leaves, and how quickly it accumulated there, so it was easy
52:02
to develop equations for turnover time.
52:08
Without tracers it’s much more difficult to do that.
52:10
You now actually have to measure the processes such as herbivory to actually
52:15
try to get an estimate of how quickly those materials are being moved.
52:19
With the tracers all you have to do was evaluate the leaves and see how quickly
52:23
it started to accumulate, and then just develop the equation for transport rate.
52:28
So, it’s kind of a short cut?
52:29
Uh-huh.
52:29
[affirmative]
52:29
To something that research might have led to otherwise, but in a more direct
52:33
route because of Cold War concerns?
52:35
Yes.
52:38
A lot of people at Georgia while I was there, had worked at Oak Ridge.
52:42
I got to visit Oak Ridge several times while I was there, and got acquainted
52:45
with a number of the people doing these kinds of studies at Oak Ridge.
52:48
More recently, since I’ve been working at Luquillo, I’ve gotten
52:51
acquainted with a lot of the folks that
52:56
did that work during that period down at Luquillo.
53:00
There’re still some tagged trees down there that are fenced off.
53:06
[Chuckle]
53:06
Were there concerns about the legacy of that study?
53:12
When you’ve worked in those areas, you tend to be a little cavalier about
53:18
it maybe, but they’ve got it fenced off.
53:20
As long as there isn’t any active movement of materials out of there,
53:23
it’s probably not going to go anywhere.
53:25
But the radioactive tracers that end
53:28
up in leaves, ended up on the forest floor.
53:31
The leaves decomposed, those radioactive tracers could enter the groundwater pool.
53:35
There was interest in following where those radioactive
53:40
traces went in ecosystems.
53:42
I think that led to the interest in nutrient cycling generally,
53:46
at many of these ecosystem sites.
53:50
How would you compare the research culture at Oak Ridge with the Andrews crew?
53:58
I don’t know that I was that familiar with it [research culture] at Oak Ridge.
54:02
If I were going to compare, I’d probably say that it was much
54:05
more regimented at Oak Ridge.
54:07
It was government research, much of it classified, so it was very different
54:11
than the more open, academic research.
54:16
One of the things I’ve appreciated here at the Andrews that I did not see so
54:23
much at Coweeta at the time, it’s been better since, but one of the things that
54:29
struck me when I started working at the Andrews, was the close corroboration
54:34
between the Forest Service, the Blue River District folks, and the academics.
54:41
While I was at Coweeta, that atmosphere was a bit testy.
54:44
And like I say, when I was working down at the Jornada, the relationship
54:48
between the USDA and the academics was a bit testy down there then.
54:55
Again, those environments have changed.
54:58
But that’s one of the things I think remains a strength of the Andrews, that
55:02
we’ve had a succession of very cooperative district rangers and their staff, who not
55:10
only have been very interested, and in some cases helped guide some of the ideas
55:15
that we were developing for research, but also been very quick and eager to
55:19
implement them elsewhere on the Blue River, sometimes, and say, “Okay, let’s
55:22
take this out and try it operationally and see what we get.” So, some of the first
55:27
new forestry cuts, for instance, were in the Blue River District off the Andrews.
55:33
Who in the district or forest [Willamette] or in the regional office [Region] would
55:37
you characterize as being the most closely involved with the work you’re doing?
55:41
I really worked directly with folks at Blue River.
55:46
John Cissel, of course, has been very helpful in identifying appropriate sites.
55:56
When I was changing the direction for the study a bit in ‘92, the LTER project
56:04
was providing sufficient money that I could add in a mature age-class and
56:08
a partially-harvested one of the “new forestry” kind of stands, where in ‘86 I
56:14
had started out just sampling old growth and sampling regenerating plantations.
56:19
In that first study, I had 10-to-15 year-old, versus 450-year-old
56:26
stands.
56:27
They were so different that an obvious question is, “Well, when
56:29
does the community become more like old growth?” So, there were enough
56:35
150-year age class forests in the area of the Andrews that I could
56:43
include that, and some of the new forestry kinds of cuts and old shelterwood
56:48
cuts.
56:48
I did a lot of work with John back then, going through aerial photographs and
56:55
to John about suitable sites to try and identify which ones, because
56:59
I wanted to make sure they were geographically intermixed so that
57:01
they would be independent replicas.
57:03
This
57:05
has been a traditional problem in forestry, and in the early years of
57:12
ecosystem research, how to deal with what we call the paired-watershed
57:16
approach, which was pseudo-replicated.
57:19
We thought all the samples we were taking on each of two watersheds,
57:22
a treated and untreated one, were independent, when in fact they weren’t.
57:26
And they couldn’t be appropriately compared.
57:29
And probably everybody who did projects back prior to ‘84 was guilty
57:35
of pseudo-replication, because that was how we did research back then.
57:38
We treated one watershed, and we had a control, and we compared them.
57:44
And you don’t know whether across that gradient there are other
57:47
confounding variables besides the treatment that could cause differences.
57:51
Were they different to start with for some reasons, that weren’t measured?
57:58
In my work since ‘84, I’ve tried to be very concerned, especially because
58:05
my research would be vulnerable to that, because it’s hard to climb trees.
58:09
You might just want to climb a few, and your replication would be minimal.
58:15
And again, when you are trying to select sites for to represent these different
58:19
types of forest classes, I did in fact have a concern because it was so hard
58:23
to find old growth outside the Andrews.
58:26
But it was also hard to find enough shelterwood and mature
58:29
age planted forests inside
58:33
the Andrews, in order to include those other two stand types.
58:37
And in doing so, I was forced to try and look for old growth outside the Andrews,
58:42
and I had to be very careful that I kept the sites, the different treatment plots,
58:51
geographically-intermixed, so I didn’t end up with all the old-growth sites
58:55
inside the Andrews, and all the mature age plant sites outside the Andrews.
59:05
There might be various environmental gradients from the Andrews besides that
59:09
site that would have nothing to do with the way the stands have been treated.
59:14
So, you worked with John Cissel to identify these?
59:18
Is that what you did?
59:20
Yeah.
59:20
Would you say that was more difficult at other places you’ve been, like
59:27
Coweeta?
59:28
Well, Coweeta was a different place when I was working there.
59:31
We had two watersheds we were working on when I was there.
59:37
I’ve had good working relations with Wayne Swank [leading
59:39
scientist at Coweeta] since then.
59:39
He helped me set up the log decomposition project that I have at Coweeta.
59:49
So yeah, I don’t know that that’s too different, but again, I think it’s
59:54
just sort of the overall collaboration between the Andrews, the academics
59:59
here at OSU and the Forest Service at Blue River, I think, which has
1:00:02
just been a real good association.
1:00:06
Yeah, Fred talked about that.
1:00:07
Good chemistry there.
1:00:08
The kind of two-way chemistry where it’s not just them refining what
1:00:11
you’re doing, but a real collaboration.
1:00:14
Yes, and it’s been a whole succession of folks.
1:00:15
I can’t remember now who the district ranger was when I came,
1:00:19
but I know Steve Eubanks followed that person, and Lynn Burditt sort
1:00:22
of carried on that same tradition.
1:00:22
I remember that, and they’ve all carried on that same tradition.
1:00:25
It’s sort of remarkable to me that all the people who’ve come
1:00:28
through here sort of have the same cooperative, collaborative spirit.
1:00:34
I don’t think that works everywhere, and I’ve been glad
1:00:37
to see that it’s worked here.
1:00:43
How would you characterize the degree of your interaction with other
1:00:45
people at the site on the Andrews?
1:00:48
Here I’m talking about the scientists and technicians and folks like that?
1:00:52
How important was that kind of interaction to your research as you recall?
1:00:56
In terms of close interaction, I haven’t had a lot.
1:00:59
There was more back when I was part of the big log decomposition project.
1:01:04
There were Jim Trappe, Mark Harmon, and Jack [Lattin] , and others
1:01:08
that were involved in that project.
1:01:10
We were working pretty closely together at that time.
1:01:12
Bob Griffiths and Bruce Caldwell were involved in that one as well.
1:01:18
Yeah, it was good.
1:01:20
We had weekly meetings, monthly meetings, excuse me, and
1:01:24
pretty close collaborations.
1:01:27
A lot of ideas generated when you’re working closely with people with
1:01:31
different perspectives working on different organisms, and sort of
1:01:34
tuned into the different concepts and approaches that that brings.
1:01:42
I still get that working with Jeff Morell.
1:01:45
But, I guess, I haven’t had real close working relations
1:01:50
with others at the Andrews.
1:01:52
I still get to meetings periodically, but my involvement has sort of gone elsewhere.
1:01:58
I enjoy multi-disciplinary research as much as I can be involved in it.
1:02:03
I still get it at Luquillo and other places where I work as well.
1:02:07
The Demo project is a multi-disciplinary project.
1:02:11
So, there is an excitement and a synergism that you get, working with people who
1:02:17
have different backgrounds that bring different concepts and approaches.
1:02:21
You’re in a little different situation than a lot of people I’ve talked to in
1:02:24
that you’ve started this kind of work as a junior faculty at Oregon State University.
1:02:30
Did you ever encounter any problems with that, where this
1:02:32
kind of work, in other words, cooperative work, might be a drag in
1:02:38
some areas of your career development?
1:02:39
It didn’t for me, I don’t think.
1:02:42
I was cautioned by the department head when I came here, to be careful.
1:02:45
He didn’t tell me not to, but he said to be careful about being sucked into
1:02:49
projects where I wouldn’t be able to show my own personal contribution.
1:02:56
With that in mind, I did get started on some other projects.
1:02:59
I had Forest Service funding to look at cone and seed insects and nursery insects.
1:03:07
My first projects at the Andrews, were myself with one collaborator, working on
1:03:12
herbivore effects on nutrient cycling.
1:03:15
And again, it wasn’t so much that I wouldn’t have been willing to
1:03:18
collaborate as the fact there weren’t other people to collaborate
1:03:21
with, really, with those interests.
1:03:25
And to some extent that’s continued to be the case.
1:03:28
Like I said, I’ve been so disappointed that we haven’t been
1:03:31
able to get more bird and mammal people associated with the Andrews.
1:03:35
Because I, as an entomologist concerned with population community
1:03:39
and ecosystem processes of insects, would feel more akin to small mammal
1:03:47
and bird people coming in with
1:03:52
maybe some of those approaches, than I necessarily do with
1:03:54
geomorphologists and plant ecologists.
1:03:58
I interact easily with those disciplines and need to, but
1:04:04
they don’t facilitate close working relationships as much as I might have with
1:04:09
other people working with other consumers.
1:04:12
Did you try to recruit some people that might be able to fill those niches?
1:04:17
Were you involved in the effort to try and bring people in?
1:04:21
I wasn’t, particularly.
1:04:23
I know there’ve been people on campus that we’ve all talked to over the years.
1:04:28
Some of that’s just the personality climate, and the other thing is the
1:04:33
fact that everybody at OSU is busy.
1:04:37
I don’t get as much time to go to Andrews meetings anymore.
1:04:41
The incentive isn’t there as much, and without the incentive, I tend
1:04:45
to do other things because we’re all just pedaling as fast as we can.
1:04:50
Welcome to Oregon higher education.
1:04:51
Yeah.
1:04:54
Again, I have a commitment.
1:04:55
If I’ve gotta support graduate students, I’ve gotta have a proposal
1:04:58
into NSF, through every channel.
1:05:01
[Chuckle]
1:05:03
That’s a point I wanted to raise here, actually.
1:05:07
Who do you consider to be your audience, and what is the balance between
1:05:13
teaching and research, the use of graduate students versus post-docs?
1:05:17
Things like that.
1:05:18
Well these are,
1:05:22
you know, there are tradeoffs.
1:05:25
I just finally managed to reallocate enough money for a half-time
1:05:30
post-doc a couple years ago, and I’ve been really pleased that I did.
1:05:33
I had somebody that I can help supervise.
1:05:36
I had done that with research assistants in the past, and actually had some of my
1:05:41
research assistants publish papers, and do some of the analyses on that support.
1:05:46
But
1:05:49
getting a post-doc
1:05:54
brings more new skills and familiarity with data analysis and reporting.
1:06:02
Somebody that I don’t have to train quite as much to bring up to speed.
1:06:09
Graduate students, though, are our market.
1:06:13
There’s continuing pressure in the department to bring
1:06:17
in more graduate students.
1:06:19
I’ve started going more and more in recent years to undergraduate assistants.
1:06:24
We’re being encouraged to
1:06:30
improve student retention at the undergraduate level, and part of that,
1:06:34
is providing jobs for undergraduates.
1:06:37
And I’ve found that undergraduates come cheaper, and I have had a
1:06:42
good rapport with undergraduates.
1:06:45
There’s somewhat less commitment there.
1:06:48
I mean, they’re not doing theses that’ll make me famous, they’re not
1:06:51
writing papers that’ll make me famous.
1:06:52
[Laughter] But they’re people that are going to go out into whatever
1:06:57
fields they end up in, whether it’s ecological or not, with an awareness
1:07:01
of what it takes to do ecological research, and some of the concepts
1:07:04
and problems that we’re facing there.
1:07:08
I’ve also been participating in the Saturday Academy program for high
1:07:14
school students during the summer.
1:07:17
And I’ve been very pleased with the high school students that I’ve employed, two
1:07:23
each year for the last four years now, and found those students to be very capable.
1:07:31
We go through an interview process with that.
1:07:33
There’s a fairly detailed application process that Saturday Academy
1:07:37
administers, and then they send interested applicants my way.
1:07:42
I choose those I want to interview, and I’ve ended up with good students.
1:07:47
So,
1:07:50
I guess as far as the balance, you could do it a lot of different ways.
1:07:55
If I wanted to maximize my publications, I’d probably be trying to get
1:07:58
post-docs, and I probably should be in some ways, but I’ve just found it
1:08:03
very enjoyable working with the high school and undergraduate students.
1:08:06
You started with using mostly graduate students and then switched.
1:08:10
Yes.
1:08:10
Research assistants.
1:08:11
Then made the switch.
1:08:14
Yeah.
1:08:14
I just tried some different things over the years when I had opportunities.
1:08:18
A lot of it’s just a matter of money.
1:08:20
I
1:08:23
usually don’t have as much as I’d like to.
1:08:24
I have a lot of students who are interested in the research and
1:08:27
apply, but, if I don’t have support to bring them, they don’t come.
1:08:31
So,
1:08:33
essentially, it’s just a matter of what funding is available
1:08:35
and what graduate students?
1:08:37
Right, graduate students and research assistants were relatively common.
1:08:41
I try to maintain a balance anyway.
1:08:43
My first grant had only a research assistant on it.
1:08:47
And you get different things with different people.
1:08:49
With a research assistant you’ve got the continuity, you’ve got the commitment.
1:08:53
Graduate students have to take classes, and they may or may not want to do your
1:08:58
work for their thesis project, so they may be doing other things a lot of time.
1:09:02
So, if you really need assistance on a project you need somebody
1:09:05
who’s committed to it and is going to put all that time into it.
1:09:09
So, research assistant is a better way to go there.
1:09:14
If you want somebody who’s going to help with publications,
1:09:16
then a post-doc is better.
1:09:19
Graduate students, eventually, if they get their thesis published, but you can push
1:09:25
that up to a point, but actually getting a final manuscript is kind of tough.
1:09:31
I’m curious about two things: how large a work group you might ordinarily
1:09:37
take with you on a site visit, and secondly, when you’re working at the
1:09:41
Andrews, where that group might stay?
1:09:44
It has varied over the years.
1:09:47
Probably some of the largest groups I’ve had have been the last couple
1:09:50
years, where I may have ten people.
1:09:54
The last few summers I’ve had two undergraduates, REU students [Research
1:10:01
Experience for Undergraduates] , two high school Saturday Academy students,
1:10:03
plus a couple graduate students, and a post-doc, depending on if
1:10:08
some other folks tag along or not.
1:10:10
Have those numbers been increasing over the years?
1:10:13
It’s been variable.
1:10:14
Back during the log decomposition project, ‘85-’86, that era, or ‘86-’87 actually,
1:10:21
I had a primarily undergraduate work crew of 8-10 students, I guess, in summer.
1:10:28
And a few of them who continued to work during the school year.
1:10:33
And they mostly lived on the Andrews during the summer?
1:10:35
No.
1:10:36
We just usually made trips down there for the time that we were collecting samples.
1:10:41
Usually we’d spend a night or two, maybe three days.
1:10:46
Stayed in the trailers down there?
1:10:48
Early on, yeah.
1:10:52
I’m not sensitive to skunks, so there was a time when the, let’s
1:10:55
see, was it the White Salmon trailer?
1:10:58
I can’t remember which one, had gotten a skunk under it one time.
1:11:01
Nobody else would stay in it, so I always had a trailer I could stay in.
1:11:05
[Laughter] [HJA campus in 1980s was collection of old trailers, and
1:11:08
was tagged “Ghetto in the Meadow.”}
1:11:08
You just can’t smell it?
1:11:08
Yeah.
1:11:10
If it’s really strong I can smell it, but I don’t find it unpleasant.
1:11:14
Yeah.
1:11:16
Students didn’t complain either?
1:11:17
Well, I don’t remember ever taking any students in there.
1:11:20
I was working alone a lot in
1:11:26
those earlier years, something I try to tell my students not to do.
1:11:29
Not to work alone?
1:11:31
Yeah.
1:11:32
Did you ever have any problems with that?
1:11:34
I never did, but it’s a precaution I’ve always tried to take, just tell
1:11:39
my students not to go out alone.
1:11:42
There are enough potential problems in the forest without not
1:11:46
being alone while you’re there.
1:11:50
I was also curious,
1:11:52
if there were any particular sites on the Andrews that you visited recreationally?
1:12:02
Yeah, I guess the Old-Growth Trail [HJA] down there by the 350 road, is
1:12:06
one that I’ve taken a few times, but I don’t usually go down there for fun.
1:12:13
I have taken my daughters, my family down there a couple of times, to camp
1:12:17
along Blue River and fish, but, it’s been only a few times over the years.
1:12:22
And what would you estimate would be a kind of an average stay when you go
1:12:25
down there with these work crew studies?
1:12:25
How long are you there for?
1:12:29
A couple days.
1:12:30
Two, three days?
1:12:30
Yeah, two or three days, max.
1:12:41
How do you characterize your interactions with local residents in Blue River.
1:12:46
To what degree were you involved with those communities at all, or
1:12:51
were they aware of your presence?
1:12:55
I haven’t been much.
1:12:56
I can’t think of any particular involvement, other than
1:12:58
shopping in Blue River.
1:13:00
Early on, before the Black Forest restaurant burned down,
1:13:03
we used to eat there a fair bit.
1:13:08
Where’s was the Black Forest restaurant?
1:13:08
There at the intersection of
1:13:12
McKenzie highway and the eastern entrance of the old highway into Blue River,
1:13:19
the main entrance into Blue River.
1:13:20
It was right there and was a nice restaurant with seafood and steaks.
1:13:25
It was
1:13:27
a pretty varied restaurant.
1:13:29
As I recall, you could get hamburgers and things like that
1:13:31
there too, and they had a salad bar.
1:13:33
It burned about six or eight years ago.
1:13:35
I can’t remember.
1:13:36
But, there isn’t even a foundation there anymore.
1:13:40
So, everybody cooks at the Andrews now, I guess, mostly, although there’s still
1:13:46
a restaurant up towards McKenzie Bridge, but I just don’t usually go up that way.
1:13:51
It was mostly on the way, or on the way out, when you’d stop off there?
1:13:54
No, we’d come down, while we were staying up there, to eat.
1:13:57
It’s just that it was easier, I don’t know.
1:13:59
You know, there’re habits you develop, and I’ve just never driven up
1:14:02
further east from there to the other restaurant.
1:14:05
There is another one?
1:14:07
Pardon?
1:14:08
There is another restaurant?
1:14:09
I think there’s another restaurant, or there used to be, and like I
1:14:12
said, I just haven’t been up east from the Andrews to check that out.
1:14:17
Should do that sometime, I guess, somebody told me there was one up there.
1:14:21
I
1:14:25
don’t want to drag you into too long of a discussion here, but if
1:14:30
you could talk briefly about your appointment as NSF program
1:14:35
director, which came in ‘92-’93, and you touched on earlier.
1:14:41
I wonder if you could identify for me,
1:14:45
first, how that came about, and then, what were your priorities and
1:14:48
goals, and to what extent did you accomplish those as program director?
1:14:53
Yeah, that was an interesting situation.
1:14:55
I was in China
1:14:58
during June and July of ‘92 when we got a call, my wife got a call, from Jim
1:15:05
Edwards, acting division director [NSF] , asking if I’d come for an interview.
1:15:11
I was only around a phone where I could call home about once a week.
1:15:14
I’d only managed to call home about three times while I was in China, and
1:15:17
managed to run up a $450 phone bill!
1:15:20
[Laughter] But anyway, the last time I called was just a few days
1:15:24
before I was going to be coming back.
1:15:27
Cathy said Jim had called and wanted me to come interview at NSF, and I just
1:15:33
thought, “No.” That was the kicker, that they wanted me there September
1:15:38
1, because they had a vacancy. I just thought, “No.” [Laughter] No way, because
1:15:44
we had moved to New Mexico State under sort of similar circumstances, with
1:15:48
about five weeks notice between approval of my request for a leave, and when
1:15:56
the school year started down there.
1:15:57
That had been frantic, and I thought, “I don’t want to do that again, upset
1:16:01
the whole family, and make a major move.” Cathy said, “Well, it might
1:16:05
be good timing, and you ought to think about this.” So, I had a few
1:16:09
days still before I flew home, and when I got home, we talked about it.
1:16:16
I figured it would have been a good experience, our daughters at that time
1:16:20
were going into second and seventh grade.
1:16:24
We figured that was a good time for them to get some of the cultural and political
1:16:31
opportunities around Washington.
1:16:33
So we decided that would probably be okay to do it, and I went
1:16:37
ahead and called Edwards.
1:16:40
This would be the day after I got back from China that I called Edwards.
1:16:44
I was on a plane to NSF two days later.
1:16:46
[Laughter] So, this was a whirlwind thing.
1:16:50
I had, in the meantime,
1:16:54
talked with some people we knew who had a realtor friend in the Washington
1:17:00
area, because we figured we’re not going to have time to make a lot of trips
1:17:04
back-and-forth to look for housing.
1:17:05
So, I managed to take an extra day while I was there to look around with
1:17:10
this real estate agent at available housing, and we narrowed it down,
1:17:14
based on talking with friends who’d been to NSF, where some of the better
1:17:19
areas were for families with kids.
1:17:24
I sort of focused on those, and we were there September 1.
1:17:26
[Laughter] We made it.
1:17:30
I guess, as far as my goals, I was interested in finding out how NSF worked.
1:17:36
I’d been familiar with a lot of programs.
1:17:39
I guess all the ecosystems studies directors for the last ten years had
1:17:44
all been close acquaintances of mine, or friends, and in some cases, colleagues.
1:17:50
So,
1:17:53
I was fairly familiar with it, but it’s funny how much you
1:17:57
learn when you’re actually there.
1:18:01
The whole grant process from the time a proposal comes in to the mail room, what
1:18:05
happens to it and how is it evaluated.
1:18:08
I
1:18:10
used to really worry about these proposal reviews that I’d get that
1:18:14
just said, “This proposal stinks!” And that’s all it would say.
1:18:18
Or, “What’s this guy doing, thinking he can call himself an ecologist?” And
1:18:23
you’re thinking, “Good grief!” One of the fortunate things you find out, is that
1:18:28
nobody really cares about those reviews.
1:18:29
They don’t count against you, and neither do the ones that say, “This is great,”
1:18:33
and don’t say anything more about it.
1:18:37
From the panel and director point-of-view, the only reviews that count are the ones
1:18:43
that are really thoughtful reviews that illustrate and highlight what’s good
1:18:47
about the proposal, what’s bad about the proposal, or what could be fixed.
1:18:52
Those are the ones you really look for.
1:18:55
And one of the things I discovered there, was how much NSF depends on
1:19:00
people from the community to come in as rotating program directors.
1:19:05
They depend on the rotators, like I was, to bring in the most current ideas.
1:19:13
What kind of problems researchers are facing in the field, what
1:19:16
the techniques are that are in current use and the concepts, and
1:19:20
the reasons for or against them.
1:19:22
Because the permanent people at NSF may go out for a review now-and-again, but
1:19:25
they don’t get those kinds of details.
1:19:28
They don’t have the hands-on experience of doing research that
1:19:33
allows them to be maybe the best judges, in some cases, of a good
1:19:38
proposal versus an excellent proposal.
1:19:42
And that’s something that you hadn’t been fully aware of before you came here?
1:19:45
Well, they were things I sort of knew about, but didn’t realize.
1:19:49
I still learned a lot about the actual workings of that.
1:19:56
I didn’t realize how dependent NSF was on rotators, to be honest.
1:19:59
NSF was having trouble getting rotators at that point.
1:20:04
Well, not really trouble, I guess I should say, but it’s been worse since.
1:20:10
I understand that there’ve been a number of positions that have been vacant since,
1:20:13
that they’ve had a hard time filling.
1:20:15
And
1:20:19
reviewers, it’s even harder to get people to review proposals.
1:20:23
And some programs there, some proposals don’t get reviewed.
1:20:27
The only people who review them are the panelists.
1:20:29
And the panelists complain because they’re not specialists in the
1:20:33
field of the proposal in most cases.
1:20:35
They want somebody who’s a technical expert in that area with the insights
1:20:40
necessary to say, “Yeah, this is going to advance science in this
1:20:44
area. This technique is the only way to do this.” Those kinds of things.
1:20:48
If you’re a panelist, and I’ve served in these capacities too, you’re thinking,
1:20:52
“Boy, I know the general ecological principles involved here, but I don’t
1:20:56
know if this is the best microbial project that we could support.” If
1:21:03
it’s outside your immediate field, you just don’t have the hands-on
1:21:08
expertise unless the proposal has been reviewed by outside technical experts.
1:21:16
So, Richard Bains, who was my co-program director at the time,
1:21:24
and I, for the ecosystem studies program, tried to call enough outside
1:21:31
people to get two to commit to review each proposal, in addition to the
1:21:36
panelists who’d be reviewing it,
1:21:40
with variable success.
1:21:41
But we did, in most cases, at least get one outside review.
1:21:47
The ecology program just can’t even touch it.
1:21:49
I mean, they have a hundred proposals each panel, and there’s no way
1:21:53
they could do that much calling, to get a few people to commit.
1:21:56
And so, a lot of these programs just are not getting adequately reviewed.
1:22:01
And it isn’t a problem with NSF, it’s
1:22:05
a problem with people in the community not being willing to review proposals.
1:22:09
I know people are busy.
1:22:10
I’m busy, but I still try to review all the proposals that get sent to me.
1:22:14
It’s a responsibility.
1:22:16
I’m getting money, it’s something I do in return.
1:22:20
And a lot of people obviously don’t see it that way, or don’t take the
1:22:23
trouble to return the investment.
1:22:25
So, you think that’s kind of an increasing problem?
1:22:28
Yeah.
1:22:30
I was talking with Scott Collins about it when he was here for the
1:22:33
Andrews site review this summer, and he said it’s getting worse.
1:22:38
Going in, did you have any particular goals or priorities as program director?
1:22:46
I didn’t.
1:22:47
I was on a steep learning curve.
1:22:53
I don’t think it helps to go in with goals and priorities.
1:22:57
NSF has its established procedures and the way things work.
1:23:01
There is a lot of influence that you can
1:23:05
have on various aspects of national policy though, and that was something
1:23:08
that I really learned while I was there.
1:23:11
I don’t think I would have even guessed it to have as a priority when I went.
1:23:16
But one of the things that we discovered, is that a lot of agency
1:23:20
funding is based on how much research in an area you’re supporting.
1:23:23
So, when the freshwater initiative was coming through, most of the work for
1:23:31
that had been done prior to Richard’s and my going to NSF in the summer of ‘92.
1:23:38
The research that had been done by NSF at that point, indicated that there’d
1:23:41
only been like a couple projects and a hundred thousand dollars-worth of support
1:23:45
for freshwater projects in the past, I don’t remember how many years it was.
1:23:51
So, NSF was only going to get out of it a pittance in new support under this
1:23:55
freshwater initiative under the way funding would have been distributed.
1:24:00
Richard and I scratched our heads and thought, “Hey, between the two of us we
1:24:03
can think of at least a dozen projects and half a million dollars.” So, we
1:24:07
did a pretty thorough search of NSF’s data-bases, and by the time we were
1:24:12
done, in the draft of this freshwater initiative that we received for approval
1:24:20
that had NSF at the bottom of the list, and would have probably only gotten a
1:24:25
percent of the money, we moved from the bottom of the list to second in terms
1:24:31
of the amount of research that NSF was supporting in freshwater ecology.
1:24:36
And that was just a matter of going out and finding what was already existing?
1:24:39
Right.
1:24:39
And whoever had done it before us, hadn’t done it thoroughly.
1:24:44
So
1:24:46
again, you had those opportunities to help show what the agency is doing, and
1:24:51
tell Congress, “Hey, we’re not just sort of an ‘also ran,’ we’re a major player.”
1:24:58
How would you relate your experience there to your own research agenda
1:25:02
before and after you got back?
1:25:06
A lot of it is just knowing better how to orient a proposal to the audience.
1:25:12
I had some idea beforehand, but what you hear from friends is always different
1:25:16
from what you’ve experienced yourself.
1:25:19
So, I think I just got a much clearer idea about how a proposal is processed by NSF.
1:25:26
Who’s likely to see it.
1:25:28
One of the things I discovered at NSF was how much power is in the
1:25:32
hands of the program directors.
1:25:35
The panelists make a recommendation, but the program directors
1:25:37
make the final decision.
1:25:41
We discussed at length what kind of a portfolio of projects we
1:25:45
wanted NSF to be responsible for.
1:25:48
If all the most meritorious proposals were for research in one particular
1:25:52
area, we didn’t necessarily have to support only those projects in that
1:25:58
particular area, we could also pick some other proposals that may not have been
1:26:02
as highly recommended, but filled out a range of areas; forest, grassland,
1:26:07
desert, aquatic, microbiology, birds.
1:26:12
We tried to support a diversity of projects instead of
1:26:21
six proposals that were all for virtually the same kind of research
1:26:24
that were most highly recommended.
1:26:26
And we thought, “Boy, if we’d fund all six of these, what are people going
1:26:29
to say?” Plus, NSF has incentives for funding certain kinds of proposals,
1:26:35
like research from undergraduate institutions to encourage, research
1:26:39
for undergraduate students that will benefit undergraduate students who
1:26:43
will participate in this project.
1:26:46
It’s got particular targets for new investigators, so it’s these kinds
1:26:51
of proposals for new investigators or investigators at undergraduate
1:26:57
institutions or women and minorities are within the meritorious pool, then you
1:27:04
can go to separate pockets of funding outside the program, and support those.
1:27:09
So, it was to our advantage in going through the list of proposals that we
1:27:13
were considering, we could say, okay, here’s one we can support from here.
1:27:18
It doesn’t come from ecosystem studies money, we can support it at the division
1:27:23
level from women and minorities money, or from undergraduate institution money.
1:27:27
There are those other special pockets of money that you could get into if you had a
1:27:32
meritorious proposal that would fit them.
1:27:36
It was interesting learning how that worked and I’ve spent a lot of time since,
1:27:39
encouraging people I know at undergraduate institutions, for instance, who are
1:27:43
interested in researching: “This is there.
1:27:44
Make a proposal.
1:27:45
Here’s how you do it.” So, I’m kind of carrying the NSF message around now,
1:27:49
and trying to encourage people to submit proposals; how to do it, how to present
1:27:57
themselves to NSF, so that they might have a shot at some of that money.
1:28:02
I should have you do a seminar to the Western [Oregon University] faculty.
1:28:06
It was interesting, when I came back here, I offered to give workshops
1:28:09
on how to write proposals for NSF.
1:28:13
And the research office scheduled me, and two people came.
1:28:18
I was just appalled that there was no more
1:28:23
interest in that.
1:28:24
Well, I gathered from what you’ve been saying here, that your network that you
1:28:26
had through the LTER drew you into NSF.
1:28:26
Would it be accurate to say that was more the case than building new networks
1:28:35
once you got there?
1:28:35
In other words, what did you bring back?
1:28:39
A lot more familiarity with NSF, how it interacts with other agencies,
1:28:44
the whole structure of the federal research development network.
1:28:49
How work funnels down from these interagency committees, the fix-it
1:28:54
committees that are coordinating committees for various aspects of research
1:28:58
and development, how their recommendations filter down to various agencies
1:29:03
and help develop their initiatives, and research or funding priorities.
1:29:11
That was something I learned, being directly involved in a couple of those,
1:29:16
such as the desertification negotiations and the terrestrial ecosystem initiative.
1:29:21
I got a lot of insights into how federal policy is developed, and I saw a change,
1:29:25
because I was there for six months under President Bush and six months
1:29:30
under President Clinton, and I got to see how that transition occurred, too.
1:29:35
That was really enlightening.
1:29:38
Things that were off the table during the first six months, all the sudden were
1:29:42
back on the next six months, and some of them were things that I had brought up.
1:29:46
I said, “You know we need to consider, for instance, if we’re going to tell these
1:29:52
Third World countries that they’ve got to reverse desertification, most
1:29:57
of them don’t have economies to allow them to do that. We’re going to have to
1:30:01
provide some way that they can do that through financial support or otherwise.”
1:30:05
During the Bush administration, that was just absolutely off the table. We
1:30:09
weren’t even going to consider that.
1:30:11
When I brought it up again after Clinton was elected, that was back
1:30:14
on the table for consideration.
1:30:16
And I left before the final outcome, so I don’t really know how it came
1:30:20
out finally, but at least there was a different atmosphere for
1:30:23
consideration of some of those issues.
1:30:27
After Clinton was elected, some of the agency people that would come to
1:30:30
meetings were changed, and instead of the three-piece suits, you’d
1:30:34
get people who’d slip their shoes off and sit cross-legged in their
1:30:37
chairs, had flowers in their hair.
1:30:38
[Laughter] It was sort of funny, you know?
1:30:42
Culture shift.
1:30:43
A real culture shift, yeah.
1:30:46
You were talking earlier about the relative importance of the rotating
1:30:51
people as opposed to the permanent staff.
1:30:54
How influential was that level in making those decisions, I mean
1:30:57
with permanent staff members?
1:30:58
It’s all collaborative.
1:31:00
NSF
1:31:02
relies on both, and they’ve got to have that in every program,
1:31:05
or at least in every cluster, a permanent person, one permanent
1:31:09
person for however many rotators.
1:31:13
In the past it was one permanent and one rotator, but they’ve sort of
1:31:18
reorganized that now into clusters and at least now one of the cluster
1:31:21
members should be permanent.
1:31:23
That’s the continuity in the program.
1:31:24
They’re the ones who can tell you, “Well, here’s the tradition, here’s
1:31:27
how things usually work. If you do this, here’s what’s going to happen.”
1:31:33
You need that. When you’re coming in as the short-termer you have to know.
1:31:39
I would have been a fish out of water if I’d been trying
1:31:43
to develop all that myself.
1:31:46
So, having permanent people there to tell you how things usually
1:31:49
work and what happens if you do this, is absolutely essential.
1:31:53
As are the rotators who, like I said, are bringing in the newest
1:31:55
ideas and the hands-on experience with techniques and approaches.
1:32:01
When you returned back to OSU, it was kind of another culture
1:32:03
shift all on its own, I bet?
1:32:05
Oh yeah.
1:32:07
[Laughter] While I was at NSF, I was getting e-mail across my desk,
1:32:09
whoever was thinking anything in the government, I’d see.
1:32:14
When I got back here, not only was I cut off from all that, but the GT
1:32:18
[Corvallis Gazette Times newspaper] was publishing things we’d seen two
1:32:20
weeks earlier in the Washington Post!
1:32:22
[Laughter] I was thinking, “Boy, is this a backwater!”
1:32:30
How would you characterize your move back into the LTER group here, and are
1:32:35
there different priorities now that you didn’t have when you went to NSF?
1:32:38
Oh, I don’t know.
1:32:39
I don’t know that it changed that that much.
1:32:44
Yeah, I don’t know that I’ve noticed anything there.
1:32:47
Does your level of involvement with the group feel pretty
1:32:48
much the same as it was before?
1:32:50
Probably not.
1:32:51
I’ve probably branched off into other things, like I said, I’ve gotten some of
1:32:55
these international involvements, plus
1:32:59
the fact that this last round of the LTER, I’m not funded on it.
1:33:03
So, it’s just been a little different.
1:33:11
I’ll try to get over as often as I can, but this term especially, there’ve
1:33:15
just been too many other commitments.
1:33:19
Last question here, and then I’ll let you go.
1:33:21
Maybe you
1:33:23
could characterize for me how you would rate the effectiveness of the Andrews
1:33:27
group in communicating to various audiences what goes on at the Andrews.
1:33:32
And I’m thinking here in comparison to some of the other LTER sites
1:33:37
that you’ve been involved with?
1:33:39
My feeling is generally that they’ve been pretty good, from the level of technical
1:33:44
journal publications to workshops.
1:33:47
I’m
1:33:52
involved in some extension work, and the examples and concepts I generally
1:33:59
present to people, are from the Andrews.
1:34:02
So, when I’m talking about forest health, a lot of the research that I
1:34:07
can bring to that is from the Andrews.
1:34:09
Because I can also bring data from eastern Oregon and Coweeta, to the extent it’s
1:34:15
appropriate, to say, “Yeah, these are common forest processes across all these
1:34:19
different kinds of forests. So, it isn’t unique to western Oregon, for instance.
1:34:25
What we find here we seem to find everywhere else, and that makes us more
1:34:29
confident that what we predict from seeing these things happen elsewhere,
1:34:32
probably will happen here.” But, the experience at the Andrews clearly
1:34:39
provided a framework for a lot of what I present to various
1:34:43
groups that are interested in pest management or forest health.
1:34:46
So, there’s good recognition now of work that they’ve done at the Andrews?
1:34:50
Uh-huh [affirmative].
1:34:50
People are aware of it.
1:34:50
I think so.
1:34:53
Yeah, the people who’ve worked at the Andrews have also
1:34:55
generally been influential in, for instance, the FEMAT Program.
1:35:01
[Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team which set framework for the
1:35:01
Northwest Forest Plan] A lot of Andrews’ people were involved in that.
1:35:04
The governor has a task force on forest health restoration in eastern Oregon.
1:35:08
Stan Gregory, Dave Perry and I have been on that.
1:35:15
I’m on a National Research Council committee on forest health
1:35:20
management in the Pacific Northwest.
1:35:23
Stan and Dave have been on that as well.
1:35:26
So yeah, the Andrews has been fairly well-recognized from
1:35:33
the standpoint of scientific support
1:35:37
agenda on whatever concepts or
1:35:41
recommendations we might be making.
1:35:45
Well, you mentioned early in the interview that there was a
1:35:48
relative lack of knowledge about the LTER in the other agencies.
1:35:56
Would you say that the Andrews group is in that same category when
1:35:59
it gets outside the LTER group?
1:36:01
How aware are people?
1:36:04
I think the Andrews is better known here.
1:36:08
Like I said, I was sort of surprised by the lack of awareness of the
1:36:12
LTER among people that I would have thought would be familiar with it.
1:36:14
Especially since USDA,
1:36:18
EPA, NASA and other agencies have been involved in research at various
1:36:21
LTER sites, that some of those folks weren’t familiar with it.
1:36:27
I don’t know what the reasons for that
1:36:30
were.
1:36:31
Well, here’s an article in The Oregonian about the
1:36:35
entomological work at the Andrews.
1:36:37
If you look behind you there’s another one that a lot of these have made
1:36:40
it to the AP [Associated Press] too.
1:36:43
That’s Andrews’ work that’s acknowledged in that one on forest health.
1:36:50
So, the word gets out.
1:36:55
I think most foresters in this region would know about research at the
1:36:59
Andrews, because most of the ecological research that’s supporting any of
1:37:03
these New Forestry ideas came out
1:37:08
of the Andrews.
1:37:08
In your field of research is the Andrews, would you characterize it as a model of
1:37:13
the kind of research that can be done?
1:37:15
Yeah.
1:37:16
Again, the Andrews, Hubbard Brook and Coweeta, have been referred
1:37:20
to as the crown jewels of the Forest Service for a long time.
1:37:24
Since back in the ‘70’s, at least, I’ve heard that reference.
1:37:29
So, yeah, they’re held up within the forestry community,
1:37:33
at least, as exemplars.
1:37:39
The Andrews is certainly one of those.
1:37:43
I probably shouldn’t keep you here any longer, but I do want to give
1:37:46
you the opportunity if you had anything more to raise, either
1:37:50
to contact me or drop me a note.
1:37:52
Okay.
1:37:54
I’m over in the Forest Science Department, and you can reach me over
1:37:55
there or I’m on the campus e-mail.
1:37:58
You teach at Western Oregon?
1:38:00
Yeah.
1:38:01
I thought I remembered something like that, but wasn’t
1:38:03
sure until you mentioned it.
1:38:04
Yeah.
1:38:05
Yeah.
1:38:06
The reason I mentioned that earlier is that we’ve got an environmental studies
1:38:09
program we just started up there a few years ago and we’ve been scrambling
1:38:13
around trying to figure out some of these solutions and things like that on funding.
1:38:17
Well, good luck.
1:38:18
Yeah.
1:38:19
Anyway, I
1:38:22
shouldn’t keep you longer.
