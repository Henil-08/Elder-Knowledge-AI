00:00
To start the interview, what I’ve been trying to do with people is get
00:02
a little bit of background on their
00:38
origins and how they came to
00:42
be working out here in the first place.
00:43
My understanding is you started out here as a post-doc out of Pittsburgh, right?
00:46
In about 1971?
00:48
Right, I came here the fall of 1971.
00:51
Same time as Stan Gregory.
00:55
Maybe you could just talk about your personal origins.
00:58
What attracted you out in the Northwest here originally?
01:01
You went to Willamette University.
01:03
Right.
01:03
I was a philosophy major in political science and was
01:05
going to go into a law career.
01:10
About my junior year, I had a friend and we’d go out on the beach, and he’d name
01:16
all the algae and all these animals, and I thought, “Boy, this beats a law
01:19
library!” So, I kept the majors, but I started taking more science courses. I
01:26
wrote to a whole bunch of graduate schools saying, “Hey, I’m a liberal arts student.
01:30
I’ve taken this much biology and statistics, would you even consider my
01:34
application?” Because I didn’t want to pay the 20 dollar application fee or
01:38
the 35 dollar application fee, if they weren’t even going to take me seriously.
01:43
The good ones didn’t write back, the first few said, “We’ve got more applicants
01:48
than we need, so don’t bother.” Then,
01:52
I had a choice between Nebraska, UBC, and Pittsburgh. I’d never been
01:56
east, was born and raised in Oregon.
01:58
So, going to the East was a big deal, and they [U of Pittsburgh]
02:03
gave me money to go year-round.
02:05
I didn’t know whether I wanted plants or animals in the Department of Biology.
02:08
That’s when I ran into
02:12
Ken Cummins, and Cummins was into streams.
02:16
I liked his energy, and liked what he was doing and his enthusiasm.
02:20
That kind of hooked me.
02:22
I’d always been into fishing, wandering around lakes and streams in
02:26
Central Oregon, and the high lakes.
02:28
But he really focused me.
02:31
Then he left and went to Michigan State, and I’d already taken all my prelims.
02:36
I thought, “Why move to another school and go through all that crap again?”
02:41
So, I stayed there, and we stayed
02:46
in close contact. I used his laboratory. I’d drive from Pittsburgh to Kalamazoo
02:52
to work on research in his lab.
02:55
He was off my committee, and I got Dan Nelson from Oak Ridge because I was doing
02:58
these isotope experiments and they had equipment there, and plus he was good at
03:04
it, so I got Dan Nelson on my committee.
03:09
He was instrumental in letting Jim Hall know that I was available.
03:14
I originally thought I was going to be working on aquatic insects with
03:17
Norm Anderson and maybe a little bit of fish work with Jim Hall.
03:23
Before I came out here, I did a quick tour and went and saw Stuart Fisher.
03:29
And I thought, “Well, if this is a watershed and a forest project, let’s go
03:32
see what Stuart Fisher is doing.” And that turned into one of the more productive
03:38
arrangements, although his group and ours have not published a whole lot
03:42
together, we’ve each published a bunch of things. But a whole bunch of students had
03:46
cycled through in the early to mid-70’s, including Nancy Grimm, who now is his
03:51
wife and colleague at Arizona State.
03:55
So, that got me thinking something bigger than just bugs and fish.
04:01
The good thing about coming out here, as I tell Norm and Jim, was soon as I got here,
04:06
they both left on sabbatical, and when they came back, they were working for me.
04:12
Because I didn’t see a future at all doing classical insect and fish work, I thought,
04:19
“My salary is on the line. I’m going to align with Dick Waring and Jerry Franklin.
04:26
There’s more of a future there and more of a chance for learning
04:29
new things there than carrying on
04:35
in insects and fish.” When I got here, they assigned Jack Donaldson,
04:42
who was in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife and who was
04:44
Stan Gregory’s major professor, to watch over me, because they needed
04:49
a regular faculty member to do that.
04:52
Jack is a wonderful friend.
04:54
And I looked at Stan Gregory and I said, “I don’t need this stuff.” Because what
04:59
Jack and Stan were having Stan do for a master’s thesis I thought just didn’t
05:04
fit at all. So, I spent the first six months trying to get rid of Gregory,
05:09
and it was the best thing that ever happened to me that I didn’t succeed.
05:12
[Laughter]
05:14
You didn’t see what he was working on as fitting in?
05:16
Oh, it wasn’t going to be relevant.
05:19
It was a little ahead of it’s time in some ways, when I look back at it
05:23
now, but it didn’t fit right then.
05:26
But, we were even good friends.
05:28
It’s
05:30
been just a wonderful arrangement.
05:33
Then
05:35
I brought in another person to help me get litter traps and everything else
05:40
up, Gary Brown, who was a colleague of mine at the University of Pittsburgh.
05:46
That’s what got the litter traps and the nylon netting up there to do
05:53
the carbon and nitrogen budgets on
05:57
Watershed 10, which I think is what helped put us into the ecosystem game.
06:06
That’s the year that Franco Harris had the “immaculate reception” game.
06:12
[Penn State football player playing for Pittsburgh Steelers who caught “miracle”
06:12
touchdown pass in NFL playoff game.]
06:12
Oh, yeah.
06:12
[Laughter]
06:12
Against Oakland [Laughter].
06:14
So, I don’t know when that was.
06:14
I think it was ‘73.
06:17
Can we use copies of this?
06:20
Oh yeah, right.
06:20
I brought these in because these are notebooks and sketches
06:23
of where we put leaf packs?
06:27
I was going to give those to the archives.
06:29
Here’s some of these that just kind of got ripped away.
06:34
Here is where we put it and this was in 1972 when we
06:39
started there.
06:44
Fred has asked me to start putting some of this material together into
06:46
an archive collection, so to speak.
06:49
Here were the original dimensions of the Watershed 10 weir.
06:52
Oh, yeah.
06:56
What it cost, an original budget number.
06:58
Probably Dick Waring’s, either that or Jerry Franklin’s,
07:01
that he didn’t know about.
07:02
Was that in ‘72 also then?
07:03
Yeah.
07:13
Well, you talked about your intellectual mentors, maybe you could talk about
07:15
your first impressions of the H.J. Andrews, in I think it was, ’71, you
07:21
said?
07:21
Yeah, fall of ‘71.
07:23
Well, I went up and looked at this place.
07:25
Like I said, most of the action was fairly traditional.
07:29
I mean, we were sampling fish.
07:34
What I kept looking for, what the storyline was.
07:39
What was going to be our theme?
07:41
And the theme wasn’t really poppin’ out at me.
07:45
So, we created a theme and a core, and that was around
07:50
material and nutrient cycling.
07:51
Then we also started looking at decomposition processes in leaf packs.
07:56
That was a carryover of being influenced by Ken Cummins.
08:05
At the time the big Kahuna here was Charles Warren, who’d done
08:11
an awful lot of energy budgets.
08:16
He was the intellectual driver of a major group here at Oregon State
08:22
working in streams, happening in the ‘60’s and very early ‘70’s.
08:29
I came from a different tradition, and we started to get these people together.
08:34
It became apparent for one reason or the other, that we would be cordial
08:38
to one another, but it wasn’t going to be an intellectual fit, because we
08:44
were off and on to another tangent.
08:46
So, we got up there and looked at this thing, and we very quickly decided
08:51
we weren’t going to do a whole lot on big streams, because there’s just too
08:55
much water coming off in the winter time, that we would focus on smaller
09:01
streams, and keep our community work and some decomposition work.
09:07
That was in ‘71-’72.
09:13
After that, we got into ‘75, and started to get into the River Continuum project,
09:17
and started branching to larger streams and different kinds of questions.
09:21
The first one was essentially reworking the original proposal
09:28
into a coherent storyline that nested within a forest biome
09:35
setting.
09:35
The [conceptual] setting was really okay; what’s the influence
09:39
of forests on these streams?
09:40
Nutrient-wise, and leaf litter-wise, what kind of processing goes on?
09:45
Then it became a better match and we had a storyline that we could
09:48
sell, and then it was a matter of shoring up different parts of it.
09:53
And in ’73, Frank Triska came out here.
09:58
That was a huge addition to us.
10:01
He’d worked with fungi and decomposition in streams.
10:07
He took over a lot of the nitrogen and the decomposition work.
10:14
When Norm and Jim came back, they were a bit surprised about the change, but the
10:21
amazing thing about the stream group, was they all just stayed together.
10:25
I mean, people went out of their way, Stan and I went out of the way to keep
10:28
Jim and Norm and Jack Lyford engaged and involved in productive work,
10:33
and they had very good students that did parts of things on the Andrews.
10:40
Even though it wasn’t the big driving part, it was a crucial part
10:45
for the intellectual robustness.
10:48
Jim Hall would drag this way and he’d pull back, he was more
10:51
conservative than us raucous post-docs.
10:57
He was a superb mentor and editor, and that helped us.
11:01
I can’t say enough about the role Jerry Franklin and Dick Waring played.
11:07
They had their own interesting, strange dance, between one another.
11:11
And it worked, because as long as they didn’t take one another seriously, they
11:14
could play good cop, bad cop; detail, big picture, onward, and it worked well.
11:20
Well, they found early that we would deliver products, and that we were
11:28
interested in making the whole thing go.
11:30
We had a corporate responsibility as well as just a discipline and
11:36
a professional interest in there.
11:40
And maybe you could say that was because our jobs depended on it,
11:45
but I don’t think that’s the way most people thought at that time.
11:49
Most people were still thinking of their individual part in it.
11:53
This cadre of post-docs started to think much more corporately
11:58
for the good of the whole, and then would move out of their comfort zone
12:02
in research and try some different things and try some interactive things.
12:06
There was a lot of good encouragement from Dick Waring and from Jerry Franklin.
12:12
Was this your first experience with the IBP when you started
12:16
working with this group?
12:17
Knew nothing about it.
12:18
Other than I knew that the energetics work of IBP was done in the 60’s, which
12:23
was a lot more zoologically-focused where they looked at energetics of
12:29
lake organisms and stream organisms.
12:33
There was a huge push on energy flow in the ‘60’s, as the Europeans did.
12:39
And then the movement really came over to North America, and that’s when people got
12:45
serious on the big [ecosystem] front here.
12:50
So, people you’d worked with at Pittsburgh hadn’t really been involved.
12:53
Oh no.
12:55
Pittsburgh
12:57
had good people, but they weren’t into the mainstream of
13:05
starting with ecosystem work.
13:09
We’d read papers and all in classes, but no one was doing any of that
13:14
at University of Pittsburgh.
13:16
We just basically learned here as we went.
13:20
I think that our mentors would be something like
13:26
Mann in England, who went to Dalhousie in Canada, did a lot with
13:30
energetics in streams research.
13:31
Then our other mentors were at Hubbard Brook.
13:34
Gene Likens and Stuart Fisher [Hubbard Brook-based] really got
13:40
into streams, in Likens’ laboratory, and then Judy Meyer followed with
13:57
work at Georgia later.
13:57
As you think about your perceptions of the work that was being done at the
13:58
Andrews at the time you started working there, did it fit with any other previous
14:04
experience with experimental forestry?
14:05
Things like that that you’d seen anywhere?
14:07
No.
14:08
When I got here, it was big confusion.
14:12
There was a major tussle between the University of Washington and Oregon State.
14:19
I wasn’t privy to all of the insides of that, but I did know
14:23
that we had to consolidate a team.
14:25
If we were going to survive in the long term, virtually everyone that worked on
14:30
the project had better be helping one another out, and had better be focused
14:35
on something that we could all do together, or we didn’t stand a chance.
14:40
The place was too isolated, and the problems too big.
14:44
That was one of the pushes with Stan Gregory.
14:47
It wasn’t a personal problem, it’s just that Jack Donaldson wanted him to do
14:51
this [salmon] carcass study, and I said, “This is just bogus.” So, Stan did it,
14:57
and then carried on with the Andrews.
15:01
Stan is really one of the great
15:06
people that made the Stream Team what it
15:11
was.
15:12
In retrospect, everything was looking our way when I was successful in getting him
15:18
away from that in the first six months.
15:23
But, then we started to get together as a group, organized who’s doing what,
15:30
starting joint experiments in which people had different roles they could
15:35
play, so that everyone knew where the core was and how they fit in on that.
15:39
We met regularly, and it was just a good bunch of people
15:43
that wanted to make it work.
15:44
And we all had our different personalities and styles, but
15:52
the common theme was to try to make it work.
15:56
Once we got our collective thoughts together on streams, then when we
16:02
go back to Waring and Franklin and tell them we were the best thing
16:05
they got, because we were organized.
16:09
Then we basically jockeyed for funds from there.
16:13
At the time, the aquatics [IBP research program] was split between University
16:18
of Washington and Oregon State.
16:21
We had streams, they had lakes, and they also had a stream program.
16:25
We were really shocked and disappointed when they hired the
16:28
aquatic coordinator Bob Wissmar
16:31
to operate out of the
16:36
University of Washington.
16:37
I felt that job should be mine.
16:39
I
16:42
was real hurt.
16:43
Then Bob came down to find out what we were doing and how we were doing it.
16:50
We very quickly established a rapport, and talked about how aquatics was
16:57
treated as a fringe in the IBP, it was an interesting fringe, but a fringe.
17:05
Our point together was that we were going to be marginalized in this thing if we
17:10
didn’t stay fully engaged, and that meant we had to get real coordinated together.
17:18
The aquatics program had to stand or fall as a collective, not as
17:25
a struggle between Oregon State streams and University of Washington
17:29
lakes, and Wissmar saw that also.
17:32
What we did was cut the stream stuff out of the
17:39
University of Washington, and leave that down here, and
17:42
they focused on Findley Lake,
17:46
and then we would look after one another.
17:49
We’d go to review meetings, and there’d be all this squabbling between different
17:54
prima donnas at the University of Washington, and then there’d be kind
17:59
of little struggles between Oregon State and University of Washington.
18:04
And the solid [aquatics] group, whether it was at Washington or
18:08
at Oregon State, hung together.
18:11
So, if we were out of the room, the lake people from University of Washington would
18:17
look after us, along with Dick and Jerry.
18:20
The aquatics got real coordinated and was very interactive from the start.
18:27
That
18:31
was real important, and that’s really what kept us in the game in many ways.
18:38
We didn’t get very parochial, and we didn’t enter into the big struggles
18:44
between the two institutions.
18:47
You’re talking about looking after your interests, was
18:48
there a struggle for budgets?
18:50
Yeah, the budget was always a big critical item.
18:53
Everyone could put 5-6 times what they were going to get, down, and
18:58
probably do a good job of spending that money on their own research.
19:02
And just the realities of big grants, you had a feeling you had to work within that.
19:07
So then, it was a struggle to show you could come through with results,
19:13
you could interact and draw more people in, and you weren’t just on
19:18
the fringes of the core program.
19:22
And we showed that.
19:26
Had you been involved in that kind of fundraising effort before?
19:29
Never, never.
19:31
Learning as you go, huh?
19:32
Right.
19:35
My motto was whatever it took.
19:40
[Laughter]
19:41
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the facilities or
19:43
resource needs at the time.
19:44
First of all, what there was and then, what kinds of things you had to go get?
19:48
Oh, there was nothing.
19:50
Norm Anderson called it a hut or lab out at Oak Creek, and that
19:59
was where Gary Brown did his work.
20:00
We would buy used parachutes, and I’d get dimensions of lumber
20:04
and how much lumber was needed.
20:06
We had to jury-rig virtually everything we did.
20:10
For early accommodations, we got Jack
20:16
Donaldson’s
20:18
little camper, and we put that up at Mack Creek.
20:23
First of all, we put it at Watershed 10, because we were collecting the leaves
20:29
doing storm-watch [stream sampling during runoff events] . Then we would
20:32
set up a rotation, and everyone had a weekend that they had to go up into the
20:37
snow in the woods to tend these nets, so they didn’t clog and we’d lose data.
20:44
But, it was very primitive.
20:47
I was there when Al Levno and Art McKee and Dick Fredriksen made the
20:54
settling basins in Watershed 10.
20:58
That was just with a chainsaw, and we put a bunch of gunk in the bottom
21:02
to try to seal it, but it was not “The Ritz” that we worked with.
21:11
We did a lot with very little, and I think every research group that was
21:16
trying to play with ecosystems did that.
21:20
The only big ticket item that I saw, and I don’t know whether IBP
21:23
paid for the whole thing or not, was Leo Fritchen’s weighing lysimeter
21:28
that you can have a whole tree in.
21:31
You can measure what was happening in this whole tree, in terms of
21:35
water balance and nutrient balances.
21:38
That was the only big ticket item that we saw, and the rest of it was scrapin’
21:43
and trying to put together a chem lab, trying to put together weather stations,
21:50
gage stations, and upgrade those.
21:53
It was always on a shoestring to keep it going.
21:58
I left before they really got the great accommodations up at Mack
22:02
Creek with the little cabin up there, and in the ‘80’s [early 1990s] when
22:09
they got the nice new buildings
22:14
in the Andrews complex there now.
22:15
It’s really a lovely facility.
22:17
But back then, we had a trailer out at Rainbow, and maybe two
22:23
trailers out there [HJA] . One of them was really falling apart, the
22:27
other one was pretty comfortable.
22:30
Everyone was expected to get in there and share.
22:33
Dennis Harr, when he was up looking at hydrology in Watershed 10,
22:36
would bring his 12-string guitar and practice that in ‘72 and ‘73.
22:42
So,
22:44
there was a lot of informal sharing.
22:47
It was a smaller group than it is now.
22:49
It’s much more wide-flung than it was back then.
22:53
It was cozy.
22:56
You’d smell a lot of wet socks
22:59
[Chuckle].
23:00
At that time, how would you characterize the ratio of
23:06
staff to post-docs or others?
23:11
There were really only two-post docs, myself and Frank Triska.
23:16
It was later in the game, probably ‘75 or
23:23
so that we started to get technicians like Barbara Buckley and Lynn Roberts.
23:27
In the early days, it was run by graduate students; Ed Grafius and Dick
23:33
Aho on the fish, and Stan Gregory.
23:38
But Stan Gregory very quickly operated a much higher level.
23:45
He was never in my opinion an ordinary [chuckle] graduate student.
23:48
Aside from being funny and mouthy, he
23:53
had a real sense of corporate responsibility, and I mean that in
23:57
the sense that he was interested in his team and the dynamics.
24:00
And I think what the Stream Team here, in fact, what the Andrews is known
24:05
for nation and international-wide, is real openness, a give-and-take.
24:11
We didn’t hold back on what we were doing and we’d enter
24:15
into the intellectual dialogue.
24:16
People would take away ideas and people felt open to express ideas.
24:21
People like Stuart Fisher and Jack Webster came here and were very
24:26
pleased with the openness, even when they didn’t agree with it.
24:30
There were these tremendous intellectual discussions and disagreements,
24:35
everyone drank beer and figured out how we could continue to collaborate.
24:42
Stan was a huge part of that, so while he was a graduate student, he functioned
24:46
a much larger level, I thought.
24:51
You said you hadn’t really heard of this place before you started working here?
24:54
No one, other that Charlie Warren’s group with Pete Duteroff, and the
25:00
group out at Berry Creek and Oak Creek.
25:03
Now, they’ve done a lot of ecosystem research, and that’s what I
25:07
though we were going to get into.
25:08
Well, they weren’t involved in it, and then, it became obvious that
25:14
they were going on one intellectual bent and style, and we were
25:19
locked into a very different one.
25:21
And while we were cordial,
25:25
we needed to go our separate ways and we did, and then
25:29
established a whole different bent.
25:30
From what you’re saying, it sounds that by the time you left to go to Weyerhaeuser,
25:36
there was a reputation that had built up?
25:38
Oh yeah, we had an excellent reputation.
25:40
People would come in from elsewhere when we got the continuum grant.
25:44
That really put the stream group, other/rather than Charles Warren’s
25:48
group, back onto a map that there was serious stream research going here.
25:53
And Ken Cummins came on sabbatical, but through the continuum work, we
25:57
got [Bob] Naiman, Chuck Hawkins, Dale McCullough, and Karen Luchessa.
26:05
That just added to the robustness, and it was the first major
26:11
project that deviated from our central core, and yet was germane to expanding
26:17
the size of streams that we did.
26:21
But we were still known in that time as not only interacting with the
26:26
Coniferous Forest Biome, but could start in major new directions, and we did.
26:33
And the Stream Team grew from a room no bigger than probably 10 x12, a
26:42
little office room where five or six of us would gather, in ‘71, 2, and 3, to
26:48
a Monday morning meeting that attracted 15 different departments from five or six
26:53
colleges, and 50 or 60 people, just to hear graduate students grope around and
26:58
talk about what they were planning to do.
27:01
That was pretty novel.
27:03
We didn’t want formal talks, but wanted people to talk about what they thought,
27:07
and take risks and stimulate the base.
27:11
That wasn’t an extremely successful way to go about doing research and
27:18
keeping in touch every week, but it really defined what we were about,
27:26
which was a much more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach that this
27:31
university had seen, in such a big way.
27:35
So, it started out as just an informal gathering of people and individuals?
27:37
Yeah, it was just a necessity to figure out how we were, on a shoestring, going
27:41
to do ecosystem work with part-time people and graduate students, who
27:47
had their own work to do, as well as
27:52
help us.
27:54
That’s when we established that everyone had to take part in the core projects.
27:59
So, graduate students, whether they liked it or not, had to
28:01
go up there and tend the nets.
28:06
And the full professors had to go up and tend the nets.
28:10
So, everyone got involved in it, and that was just part of the
28:15
spirit, and it continues today.
28:17
We still interact with Jim and Norm, and I think that’s one of the real marks.
28:22
There hasn’t been a person that worked with us or came through here in a
28:28
major way, that we still wouldn’t or still don’t collaborate with.
28:34
And I think that’s a testimony to the spirit and the openness of the place.
28:41
You mentioned several times the evolution towards the River Continuum idea.
28:47
Maybe you could elaborate on that a bit, the origins and the concepts,
28:50
and how all that got put together.
28:53
Well, that
28:57
got started, really in ’72,
29:04
the winter, actually spring of ‘72, February of ‘72.
29:09
It was right after I got here.
29:11
I said, “Well, we need to bring in some of the big stream people, the stream
29:15
groups.” Robin Vannote’s group had filled out the academy in Stroud [Water Research
29:20
Center in southeastern Pennsylvania] , and it was just really starting to crank
29:22
and make waves. I’d stopped to see him before I came back here to Corvallis.
29:29
Charlie Warren had ideas of what was going on here at Oregon State, so I
29:35
asked Professor Warren if he would be willing to put on a workshop, and
29:40
we would bring people like Ken Mann who’d done all this energetics in
29:43
England and who’s now at Dalhousie.
29:45
We’d also bring in Ken Mann,
29:51
Ken Cummins, Wayne Minshall,
29:54
Robin Vannote and their graduate students.
29:56
So, they all arrived here in
30:01
‘72.
30:02
Charles Warren laid out what he thought his ideas of the world were.
30:07
It took for two-and-a-half days, and it was a courageous thing for Charles
30:14
to do, just to unload all this in front of all these critics and spectators.
30:20
What evolved out of that was we were not going to follow
30:26
the path that Charles took.
30:28
What we were going to do was work much more with nutrient material balances.
30:34
What it did do was establish the fact that we were serious, and we
30:40
started this dialogue back in ‘72 with Minshall and Cummins and Vannote.
30:49
We would gather together at ecological society meetings, and pretty soon
30:56
followed it up with a small grant in
31:01
1975 that put ideas together.
31:05
We gathered at Hickory Corners there at Michigan State’s field station,
31:09
at Cold Lake, and agreed that out of this would come a paper, and
31:16
that we would write a big proposal.
31:18
So, we wrote a proposal, and that got funded.
31:23
Part of the reason it got funded was that Jerry Franklin was the program
31:29
officer at National Science Foundation.
31:32
It was a time when there was a huge struggle between people who had done
31:38
population and small community ecology,
31:45
and the ecosystem scientists who came up through IBP.
31:48
The population and community ecologists didn’t think it was good science and
31:51
it was taking out of a common pie, so there’s less money available for them.
31:56
So, there was just this classic
32:01
beating up on us.
32:01
Well, the classic ecologists always rated ecosystem proposals low in part,
32:06
because they were big, messy proposals.
32:11
Jerry took a look at ours, which got an interesting mix of marks, and he
32:19
said, “We’ve got to take a risk with some new ideas.” Because that was what
32:24
Jerry felt that his legacy was sizing up to be. And he’d sized up the group and
32:29
figured that they would come through.
32:30
So, we got that and he was very instrumental, along with the
32:36
other brass at National Science Foundation, of getting us started.
32:40
And once it got started, it ran on its own really well.
32:46
That started in ’72, and was because we kept in touch and
32:52
started to talk about the lack of a defining concept for streams, and
32:59
whether we had anything to offer.
33:00
Robin then served up his River Continuum idea and we knew we had a winner.
33:06
Then it was a matter of structuring how we were going to test or describe
33:13
this concept empirically, at four different sites and in a common place,
33:18
and it just took off from there.
33:22
But it was because we were a viable site that were a part of that.
33:28
And then, we were one of the major energy and intellectual drivers
33:34
to keep it going, and to get the proposal in the first place.
33:40
So, part of what made it successful was the established climate of
33:45
interdisciplinary exchange that you were already instituting?
33:46
Very definitely.
33:47
We got good encouragement from Dick Waring and Jerry.
33:51
They knew the biome, the
33:55
IBP, was winding down, and they wanted to keep a core here.
34:00
The River Continuum provided enough of a core that would lead us in
34:06
some new directions, and still feed off what we’d already done.
34:10
That was the whole point; define a core, and then, grants you get
34:16
are just spokes off that core.
34:19
Occasionally, you get a flyer that leads you into another direction,
34:22
but for the most part, we tried to build on what we’d already done.
34:25
That way, we had a robust program.
34:29
At the same time, we tried to take our overhead in the early days, and put it
34:34
either into new equipment or new pilot studies, like when some of the riparian
34:41
vegetation was funded out of our overhead, to Alsie Campbell, and that started a
34:46
whole set of riparian work and papers.
34:48
Likewise, the wood work
34:54
got started on a flyer and developed its own
35:01
grant and proposals.
35:04
So, in this kind of interim period, from the slowing down of the IBP to the startup
35:06
of the EER, was that in any way beneficial to the Continuum [River] project?
35:06
Right.
35:06
There was another step in succession, intake succession, with a new
35:25
decomposition
35:28
grant, that Chuck Hawkins, Stan, and Frank Triska were involved in,
35:34
that really bridged into the EER.
35:39
Again, the players had all interacted in various things.
35:43
Like Chuck Hawkins went on to get a Ph.D. with Norm Anderson, but he was
35:48
very much thinking and working in the whole group in the mid to late ‘70’s.
35:55
Then, he post-doc’ed here a while, as did Cliff Dahm, and suddenly we were
36:01
getting oceanographers starting to look at dissolved organic carbon in small woodland
36:09
streams as well as the Columbia Basin.
36:11
So, people started to take these little streams which formed the core
36:17
of our information, and then looked all the way to the Columbia River on
36:24
carbon flow and carbon standing crops.
36:29
So, we thought,
36:32
again, that the attitude of allowing and encouraging other
36:37
scientists to come in was good.
36:38
Cliff Dahm gave us an entrée into oceanography.
36:41
When Mt. St. Helens blew in 1980, I came back here, and many of the same
36:46
players that worked in the Andrews, were able to join with players that hadn’t
36:51
worked in the Andrews, like John Barros and Marv Lilley, who were working at
36:56
deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and get them involved in terrestrial issues.
37:03
It’s a tribute to the kinds of post-docs they got.
37:06
When Ken Cummins got here, some colleagues of his, Amy and Milt Ward
37:12
came out, and they interacted with Nick Aumen, who was getting his Ph.
37:18
D. in microbiology at OSU.
37:20
So, there’s just a whole cycle of people that played and worked well together.
37:31
When you think back to 1971 when you first arrived here, did the
37:33
place strike you at that time as being uniquely interdisciplinary?
37:37
Not at all.
37:44
I was drawn initially because of Charles Warren and Jim Hall and Norm Anderson.
37:51
I knew less about Jim Hall other than he was a friend of Ken Cummins, than
37:54
I knew about Norm Anderson’s work.
37:56
And I was into caddis flies and Norm was into caddis flies, so I
37:59
thought, “Ah, great match.” And then, Charles Warren was doing all this,
38:02
at the time, real cutting-edge work, stemming from a water pollution grant.
38:07
I thought, “Well, this is the right place to go for streams.” And I got
38:12
here and the pull actually was towards forestry, and that’s when I just
38:17
made the choice that I was better off working with Franklin and Waring.
38:25
They were people that gave you a lot of room to maneuver, and you had to come
38:29
through, but I could deal with that.
38:34
You could rant and rave and have intense dialogues with
38:40
them, and get along just great.
38:43
They were very encouraging, and they would find extra dollars to help us out.
38:50
We didn’t go to the well that often, but when we did, we got help.
38:55
That certainly put us over the hump.
38:56
They were the ones that helped us get a technician for six months to get
39:01
us started on weirs and litter traps and things like that at Watershed
39:06
10, or we’d never have gotten off
39:13
the board.
39:16
What you had going was a relatively small group at that time.
39:19
It was not a campus-wide phenomenon was it?
39:21
No, I didn’t think so at all.
39:24
It grew as success and the intellectual excitement grew.
39:31
More people started to show up at meetings.
39:35
It was a decision that Waring and Franklin had made, saying, “Hey, for
39:38
our money, we’re getting more out of a cadre of post-docs than we are
39:43
out of full professors.” Both Dick
39:48
and Jerry really pounded hard at the University of Washington.
39:52
And then, Dick Waring really went after the old guard in
39:57
forestry here at Oregon State.
40:00
He said, “This just isn’t a pork barrel thing, we’ve got to come through.
40:07
You can’t be isolated intellectually.
40:10
Use the money to fund students.” The post-docs we did have here
40:16
were actually delivering for them.
40:22
We were always encouraged to show up at those groups.
40:25
Bill Denison, when I first came here,
40:30
had a whole bunch of
40:34
wonderful and strange people that were working on lichens and mushrooms, and he
40:39
and George Carroll had a good thing going.
40:42
I got invited to their brown bag discussions, and they would bring
40:45
people in and talk about neurological networks, highway networks, tree
40:49
branch networks, and stream networks.
40:51
We’d get there,
40:54
eat our food, and get to know one another.
40:59
I never did anything with that group other than I still respect them and still
41:04
interact with them, but they had these informal get-togethers once a month.
41:09
From playing ping- pong to just brown bags and taking any wild-hair idea and
41:17
tossing it around, it was really exciting.
41:20
Bill Denison had wonderful ideas.
41:24
I had done a little of that at the University of Pittsburgh in graduate
41:30
seminars, where electrical engineers and neurologists got together
41:37
with some of the stream types to talk about networks and patterns.
41:42
But this was the first time where you knew what you came up with, you could
41:48
put down on paper and get funded, to check out or actually do something with
41:55
what you had and get a paper on it.
41:58
So, it was an added component here, and it was funded.
41:59
Oh yeah, it was just a lot of good intellectual excitement.
42:06
Once we resolved our issues with the University of Washington,
42:10
and mostly with my hurt feelings,
42:14
then the University of Washington and Oregon State aquatics group knew
42:18
that we were going to stay together.
42:20
We still do interact with those people a quarter century later.
42:26
We didn’t have to worry about institutional issues.
42:30
We worried about working with Jerry and Dick, and we kept in touch with Jeff
42:38
Ritchie, Bob Wissmar and those people.
42:40
We just didn’t worry about the inter-institutional haggling.
42:44
We could do our job and were encouraged to go do it.
42:48
And it paid off.
42:49
I mean, in the end, certainly the aquatics group was one of the stronger
42:54
groups, as a collective, in the biome.
42:58
There was apparently less of a division between the two universities in the
43:03
aquatic program than the terrestrial?
43:03
Not at all.
43:07
The post-docs purged the major professors out of fisheries at
43:13
the University of Washington, and that was high risk for those
43:19
individuals like Wissmar and Ritchie.
43:22
But, it was a necessary evolution if you were going to take a scarce
43:28
resource and make it go further.
43:32
All those people have gone on to nice careers and jobs, and made
43:38
major contributions in limnology.
43:41
When you say they purged the major professors out, did they
43:44
take control of the funding?
43:46
That’s right.
43:47
And again, people like Waring, and people like Gessel
43:52
and Dale Cole, allowed that to happen, but they would not have succeeded
43:57
if they hadn’t done some major surgery on some of the old guard.
44:06
The fisheries research institute cut ‘em off from the funds, because
44:09
their work was peripheral and they weren’t intellectually engaged.
44:18
I gather you hadn’t worked with the Forest Service before you came here
44:22
and started working with this group.
44:24
I thought maybe you could talk a little bit about your interactions
44:25
with the district staff.
44:31
We didn’t interact a whole lot with them.
44:33
Jerry Franklin and Dick Waring did most of the interactions, although we would
44:39
inform them when we were going up.
44:40
But it was a pretty conservative bunch of rangers [Blue River R.D.] . The
44:46
wonderful relationship they’ve got with the supervisor, and particularly
44:50
with Lynn Burditt, the ranger, that they now consider them all
44:56
corporate partners.
44:57
In
44:59
the old days, we could be considered a bunch of “weirdo beardos” out there
45:03
that were irreverent, sometimes a bit rude, and focused on themselves. They
45:13
didn’t see what they would gain from it.
45:16
In fact, they looked at us as more an impediment and
45:20
something they had to put up with
45:24
while they were running the forest.
45:29
We didn’t think too much about it.
45:30
I know towards the middle of the ‘70’s, we had the infamous Lightfoot
45:37
[timber] sale, which us stream types called the “heavy-foot” sale, because
45:43
it allowed salvage of wood out of streams, and we were into large
45:47
wood in streams and doing mapping.
45:50
They came along with a salvage operation and some road maintenance,
45:54
and there was a trade-off made.
45:59
We did not think that was in the best interests
46:03
of the experiment station or of our stream work in particular.
46:07
But it happened, and that was just a part of the trade-off that
46:13
had to go on, or people perceived that had to go on at that time.
46:18
But, for the most part, it’s been a steady evolution of more interactive people.
46:26
When Steve Eubanks came, he said, “Okay, you guys say this, this, and this.
46:31
Well, here’s what it looks like to me.” We might have tossed some idea out a bit
46:36
flippantly or it was poorly thought out.
46:40
He took it and ran it back at us.
46:42
That was the first time we got a ranger that not only took the science seriously,
46:47
encouraged it, but kept us honest with it.
46:51
That was healthy for both sides, and that really continued with Lynn Burditt.
46:58
The last ten to twelve years have been highly interactive.
47:04
I’ve been more on the periphery of the Andrews group these
47:07
last ten or twelve years.
47:10
I look at the contrasts, and see where these people have
47:13
gone in the Forest Service.
47:16
They’re still pretty conservative in terms of getting on with integrating the best
47:22
of science and trying to take a situation like an experimental forest and say, “How
47:27
can we make this work for us?” I think that was the attitude of Steve Eubanks and
47:32
Lynn Burditt during all this transition from the old way of doing forestry
47:41
[HJA set up to study harvesting methods and impacts on water,
47:42
soils, erosion, etc.] to a
47:46
more ecosystem-based approach to try to manage forests for biodiversity,
47:51
clean water, as well as for trees.
47:56
I think the group was lucky to get people like Eubanks and Burditt.
48:01
These are the leaders making things happen within the legal
48:05
constraints and are driving change with the times, in my opinion.
48:09
So, it’s a matter of replacement of personnel, not conversion
48:12
of people who are there?
48:13
No, no.
48:14
I don’t know whether Jim Caswell [Blue River RD Ranger before Eubanks] really
48:16
thought he learned anything from the experiences, other than we were a
48:20
pain to him a good share of the time.
48:24
Those old rangers would be worth interviewing.
48:31
I talked to Mike Kerrick, who was supervisor of the Willamette.
48:35
Well, Kerrick is one of the new guard.
48:36
He was there when Eubanks was there, but there was Jim Caswell, but the guy
48:41
before him was…..it’ll come to me in a minute, was more into the timber stuff.
48:51
We had some run-ins with him, and he was always someone who was ready to throw
48:57
us out, yet they always allowed us to filter samples there in the basement
49:01
[Blue River Ranger Station] . That’s where we did some of our original
49:05
water sample processing and titration.
49:08
And I think having Art McKee and Ross Mersereau up there really helped us out.
49:13
I mean there’s no question we wouldn’t have survived if Art McKee hadn’t been
49:17
up there to smooth out the rough edges, much less take care of the niceties.
49:24
Of living there close to the people and getting along?
49:25
You couldn’t say enough about the need for that.
49:32
While you were working closely with the group there in the
49:37
‘70’s, what was the degree of your involvement with the local community?
49:41
Did you go down there to stay overnight?
49:42
We would spend the night there, and it would either be
49:49
in tents or these trailers.
49:52
And we would drink beer in the local tavern at that time.
49:56
It was a split-personality community; hardcore logging with
50:04
the Forest Service community.
50:08
We were just moving out of the ‘60’s, and so you had a lot of
50:14
the flower children and the drug trade was focused in Blue River.
50:18
And I remember in the mid ‘70’s going into the Blue River Tavern for a beer, and we
50:24
took over one of these foosball machines.
50:29
We’d been up there working hard and a couple of us thought
50:32
we were really pretty good.
50:34
We were having a good time, and pretty soon a couple of people came up and put a
50:38
quarter on the game and it was their turn.
50:43
Mike Murphy and I were playing, and they started to ask us questions, and
50:47
we got the first two or three points.
50:50
Then, when they figured out that we were just a bunch of scientists and not
50:54
narcs, we didn’t see the ball again.
50:57
They just blew us off the table and none of us had a shot at either pool
51:02
[chuckle] or foosball with these people.
51:04
Then we’d go in the bathrooms and there were deals being made.
51:10
There was a crowd that checked out
51:16
the scientists pretty close.
51:20
Occasionally we gave high school talks, and I remember giving a couple of those
51:26
at McKenzie High School, the McKenzie Eagles.
51:32
There was a high school right out of Blue River.
51:35
So, we didn’t do a whole bunch with them.
51:38
We did more with the Eugene crowd, with the natural history museum and
51:44
University of Oregon, and naturalist groups, Audubon groups out of Eugene,
51:51
than we did with the real locals.
51:53
Other than the fact we hired locals, when
51:58
we had to do bricks and stuff, and that was always interesting.
52:02
I’m sorry Stan isn’t here to help jog my memory because we’ve had some weird ones,
52:08
some of them that were just really spaced out, and a couple of them that were really
52:15
hardcore workers.
52:16
I mean, they gave you an honest day’s work for your pay, but the
52:19
spaced-ones, they hardly knew, seemed to ask where they were.
52:25
I think, at that time, there were some thefts of rope and some things like
52:29
that that we’d left on the Andrews, so we started to gate different roads.
52:36
You started a road closure system?
52:37
Right.
52:38
I think that came on in the late ‘70’s,
52:42
because at that time Bill Denison and George Carroll, had spun-off
52:46
and gotten their canopy work going.
52:52
They’d rig up a tree [for climbing] , and they’d lose several hundred
52:55
dollars worth of rope a time or two.
52:57
And they said, “Wait a second, we can’t keep having this
53:06
go on.”
53:06
When you were working up there, was there some sort of a formal check-in system to
53:09
let people know where you were working?
53:10
No.
53:15
In those early ‘70’s, Art McKee
53:19
would know when we were coming up there.
53:22
And sometimes we would need help from the Forest Service for some of our
53:25
people, and he would try to arrange that.
53:29
We would tell him where we were gonna be.
53:33
We rarely went out as just a single person.
53:38
It was always usually two or more people out there.
53:40
Was that for safety reasons?
53:42
Yeah, pretty much.
53:45
Those times were really amazing.
53:47
I was talking with Stan just before he interviewed with you.
53:52
We did some real firsts in the Department of Fish and Wildlife [OSU] . We were the
53:58
first to get women on our field crew.
54:02
At the time, we had to talk to the wives of people there to ask if it was okay.
54:10
We were told to do this, and we thought, why should we do that?
54:15
I mean people are out there working and people are responsible for their behavior.
54:21
So, in a sense, we did a bunch of gender integration.
54:27
And then, we hired a woman who was
54:34
had polio, and could not move very well.
54:38
And we figured a way to use her in the field too.
54:42
We would go out and take her up into the woods, and she would be the recorder.
54:49
We would go bring the bricks with these leaf packs on them, or sticks that had
54:54
been marked to Barbara Buckley, and she would record them and get them in
55:00
bags, and generally take care of them.
55:04
Even though she wasn’t very mobile, she was an essential part
55:10
of getting the samples collected.
55:13
When we got back to the lab, she did a lot of the grinding and getting
55:16
things ready for the chem lab, and looking after our people and keeping
55:25
track of the different projects.
55:28
She was kind of our first lead technician.
55:34
You started to make a move towards hiring more technicians
55:37
and fewer graduate students.
55:39
Yeah, that was probably, that was the mid ‘70’s.
55:40
We were getting to the place where we needed full-time help and just
55:45
couldn’t rely on graduate student help.
55:48
They were doing their own things, and it was important to the group, but we
55:52
needed a core of full-time workers.
55:56
Did that involve a different source of funding or anything?
55:58
No, we basically got increases.
56:01
Like we always told Jerry we were the best thing he had going.
56:05
He and Dick Waring were always grateful, and they gave us the boost.
56:14
Now they might have a little different version of it, if they were here,
56:18
but they took care of us pretty well.
56:21
And they could see that, if we were going to come through,
56:23
we needed the full-time help.
56:26
Yes, Jim Hall kept raising that in the meeting the other day.
56:27
They just looked upon each other as
56:31
the best thing they had going.
56:46
[chuckle] Yeah.
56:46
What was your personal transition from there?
56:46
Back in ’77,
56:51
being a long-term post-doc wasn’t going to be a viable future.
56:58
I had a growing family when we were being paid ten or eleven thousand a
57:04
year, and we were all on soft money.
57:07
If we didn’t get our own money, then our salary didn’t get paid.
57:12
At that time, we’d built up a number of grad students, a number of technicians,
57:17
and a couple of us post-docs, and I was in charge of getting money for them all.
57:21
Well, that was getting old, and there was no guarantee the
57:25
university was going to back us up.
57:26
So, I had a colleague, Pete Bisson, at Weyerhaeuser say, “Hey, we’ve
57:31
got a research manager job open at Weyerhaeuser, would you apply?” I
57:38
did, and interviewed with them, and they offered me three times the salary
57:43
I was getting at Oregon State, so I
57:48
took that.
57:49
And at the time, there
57:52
were some difficulties with my marriage, and we decided we would just
57:58
leave Corvallis.
57:59
When I got to Weyerhaeuser, I stayed with the group two ways.
58:04
Dick Waring was extremely helpful, and he said, “Now,
58:08
really Jim, you’ve got three years
58:12
at Weyerhaeuser before you cease to be a viable research scientist.” He
58:18
said, “Think hard about what’s going to happen in those three years.”
58:24
And Jerry also had the same advice.
58:27
But Jerry, in his wonderful style, would always have these “pulse”
58:33
studies in which he gathered a large group together for a week or two of
58:35
field work in a beautiful, wild place.
58:35
We had a big Weyerhaeuser group that went up on a pulse study to the Hoh River [west
58:38
side of the Olympic Peninsula] where we
58:42
looked around for a couple weeks on the Hoh River.
58:46
And that led to a number of research projects that got funded, and
58:49
a number of theses and papers.
58:52
At the same time, Dick Waring and Jerry helped get me on National
58:58
Science Foundation panels for reviewing grant proposals.
59:01
Well, that kept me into the mainstream of science.
59:06
I mean they’d recommend me to Tom Callahan and to John Brooks at the National Science
59:11
Foundation, and I reviewed proposals for National Science Foundation from ‘78 to
59:23
‘80.
59:23
That really kept me in the game.
59:24
It became apparent after a couple years, that Weyerhaeuser
59:28
was not my cup of tea, so
59:34
I talked to the [PNW] station director.
59:35
At the time it was Bob Tarrant, and I asked him if he was going to
59:38
replace a scientist who had gone back up to Alaska, Bill Meehan.
59:43
He said, “Are you interested?” I said, “Well, I’m always interested.”
59:47
He said, “Well, send me a CV.” And he just ordered Bill Meehan
59:51
to write a position around my CV.
59:56
I don’t think Bill Meehan was too thrilled with it.
1:00:00
Then, between Jerry and Tarrant, we negotiated a start-time and a salary.
1:00:07
But Meehan didn’t tell me when the position was open, I just had a
1:00:10
premonition I ought to call him and ask him what’s happening to this position.
1:00:14
I had five days to go before the whole thing closed and I didn’t even know it.
1:00:18
So, I got my application in, I got the job, and I came here.
1:00:28
Two things happened.
1:00:29
One,
1:00:31
it became obvious that the future in Forest Service research was
1:00:35
with anadromous fish, and we didn’t have those at the Andrews.
1:00:38
It also became obvious to me that my power-base, intellectually and
1:00:43
friendship-wise, was with the Andrews
1:00:47
group.
1:00:47
And about that time, Mount St. Helens blew.
1:00:51
So, I was back ridin’ in there with my old buddies.
1:00:54
Stan was over his head with Andrews’ work, so he got involved with some of
1:01:00
the St. Helens work, but really Fred Swanson, Jerry Franklin and I, got
1:01:06
full-bore into St. Helens work, and I think still, the chance of a lifetime.
1:01:11
To take some of what we’d learned on the Andrews, and think, “Well, here’s the most
1:01:15
colossal event we’ve seen in our careers.
1:01:18
What’s the recovery, what are some of the processes we’d look for?” Then I
1:01:22
was able to draw on Cliff Dahm, bring the oceanographers in, Milt and Amy
1:01:28
Ward, Gary Lamberti was post-doc-ing with Stan at the time, and Al Steinman.
1:01:35
A whole bunch of the Andrews group also did work up on the mountain.
1:01:44
So that kept that base going, but by-and-large, I’ve stuck more
1:01:49
onto the anadromous fish side of things, and Stan and crew have
1:01:55
continued the core of the Andrews.
1:01:59
Although I haven’t been directly involved in much of their
1:02:03
discussions, I’m a huge supporter.
1:02:07
Through a
1:02:10
position here, I’ve funded studies up there through Stan and Fred Swanson.
1:02:18
At the time, Fred Swanson had a different assistant station director than I
1:02:24
did, so we would go for year-end money for joint projects on the Andrews.
1:02:29
The collaboration and respect has always been there, it’s just that I wasn’t as
1:02:36
actively involved in it as I used to be.
1:02:40
I follow it closely, I keep up on it through Stan and Fred Swanson,
1:02:46
but really the salmon issues drew me away from the Andrews.
1:02:53
Other than when St. Helens blew, there was a period of time through
1:02:58
1987 where that same crowd in the Andrews was working real intensely
1:03:08
on recovery of Mount St. Helens, too.
1:03:12
So, if I’m following you correctly, Fred Swanson is the one that kind
1:03:16
of pulled you back into that?
1:03:18
Yeah, well, Fred and Jerry both.
1:03:21
Jerry’s been one of the finest mentors I’ve ever had, and
1:03:26
is a close friend today.
1:03:28
Fred Swanson was at the University of Oregon, I think in ‘74 or ‘75,
1:03:35
and we would run into each other, and I had him over to dinner and to
1:03:39
talk to our stream ecology class.
1:03:43
I think our friendship, as well as the excitement going on the Andrews,
1:03:47
was pivotal in him coming here to OSU on a post-doc, and basically
1:03:54
getting on with the Forest Service.
1:03:56
Those are ties that aren’t going to go away.
1:04:02
I feel like all of this group of people looks after one another,
1:04:05
whether still working with them or not.
1:04:07
I think that’s a sense of research community that doesn’t go away; in
1:04:12
my case, it’s real important to me.
1:04:15
People like Art McKee, Stan, Fred Swanson, Jerry, always invited
1:04:22
me and consider me part of the team, so I’ve never felt shunned.
1:04:26
I felt embarrassed I wasn’t able to do more work with them, but I’ve
1:04:31
felt like the future of our Forest Service research here was going
1:04:36
to be with the anadromous fish.
1:04:39
With the exception of using that tremendous intellectual
1:04:43
capacity when the mountain blew.
1:04:45
I think the response that the ecological community had, and particularly
1:04:50
we on the water, was just amazing.
1:04:54
Bringing in oceanographers to look at chemotrophs and all those weird
1:05:01
forms that were there the first couple of years, compared to what they were
1:05:07
normally seeing in their streams here.
1:05:09
So, the way you characterize it is that sort of energy after the explosion of
1:05:16
Mount St. Helens was a derivative of this pre-existing connection you had?
1:05:19
Yeah, you had a cadre of people.
1:05:22
They were busy people already trying to come through with this, but when that
1:05:26
thing blew, we were able to entice them and encourage them, and that encouragement
1:05:31
came from Fred Swanson and Jerry Franklin.
1:05:34
And like I say, while Stan was not able to get into it big-time, but we were able
1:05:41
to get a lot of his post-docs involved in it, like Cliff Dahm and Milt and Amy Ward.
1:05:50
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how your understanding of
1:05:55
stream biology evolved from the time you started working at the Andrews
1:06:00
through to the present, and particularly, about the intellectual models that
1:06:05
you followed or tried to follow?
1:06:14
I did my early work with
1:06:18
trophic feeding behavior
1:06:24
and did mostly descriptive work on two species, then did some experiments on
1:06:34
what they ate, and so that flow always attracted me.
1:06:40
I’m an empirical descriptive ecologist.
1:06:43
I’m not a good experimentalist.
1:06:46
Dick Waring’s a good experimentalist.
1:06:48
I’m not.
1:06:51
So, you’d try to gather people around that were more experimental than I was.
1:06:58
What it really boiled down to was, it became real important that we
1:07:06
solidify the contribution that forests made to streams.
1:07:11
Everyone waved an arm at it, but nobody, other than Stuart Fisher in Likens’ group,
1:07:17
had really formalized the connection.
1:07:19
I think Ken Mann in England, did on the River Thames.
1:07:23
But there was no data on energetics and material flows and balances in
1:07:28
streams or the contributions of forests.
1:07:33
The decision to go in that direction was a good one, because that panned out,
1:07:39
and we could show clearly the domination of the forests on smaller
1:07:46
streams, and then the emergence,
1:07:50
trophically, of different contributions of algae and moss on larger rivers.
1:07:58
That had been observed, the Europeans had seen that a lot, but they hadn’t really
1:08:02
formalized it in an ecosystem context.
1:08:05
I think that’s what we did.
1:08:07
It wasn’t that we were breaking total new ground.
1:08:11
I think that we were riding the shoulders of Stuart Fisher and Gene Likens.
1:08:18
I think the “river continuum” came off of that.
1:08:22
We really checked how
1:08:26
robust the interaction and the connectedness of the forest was, and that
1:08:30
stimulated a whole new line of thinking
1:08:35
in stream ecology.
1:08:36
We
1:08:40
had a defining concept for ecologists and ecosystem types to play with.
1:08:42
And they did that.
1:08:51
Another thing that stemmed off this was, when everyone was into
1:08:53
leaf breakdown and leaf packs, they
1:08:57
were using leaves as a great energetic driver, which they are in small streams.
1:09:02
Everyone tried to test
1:09:07
the continuum ideas we put together, which were really based a lot on
1:09:14
context from geomorphology, that were poorly-tested and just
1:09:20
based on notions of minimizing variance and maximizing efficiency, and
1:09:31
more on the thermodynamics of streams.
1:09:35
Well, that never really got tested.
1:09:37
What really got tested was the contribution of forests to small
1:09:42
streams, and whether there was a succession as you went to larger streams
1:09:46
from leaf-dominated organisms and processing to more algal-dominated large
1:09:53
rivers with high light availability.
1:09:54
That concept has been amazingly successful.
1:09:57
Not only as a straw-person, as a straw argument, for people to bang away at.
1:10:05
It’s got modified and reworked.
1:10:08
When you go to the classroom and back, as long as water is going to run
1:10:11
downhill, you’re going to come back to some sort of continuum and succession
1:10:19
or graduation of different energy-processing.
1:10:24
That was real exciting and stimulating.
1:10:28
The other part was the logs.
1:10:30
We used to not think about logs in streams as anything until we did organic
1:10:35
matter and energy budgets, and found out all this wood was the total dominant.
1:10:38
While the energetic driver was these leaves, they were a minor-league
1:10:42
part of the organic story.
1:10:43
So, even a very small fraction of processing of wood was a huge contribution
1:10:49
to an energy budget on a stream.
1:10:51
That got us looking into structural roles of wood, which is still going on today.
1:10:57
Large wood in streams turned out to be important, instead of something that we
1:10:59
cursed when we tripped over it as we went to gather leaf packs or do our sampling.
1:11:05
Now, we looked at it as something really unique and worthy of study in itself, and
1:11:12
that included connections with the forest.
1:11:20
We were told by many of the mainstream scientists, “Oh, it’s just an
1:11:24
artifact of you being in the West that you’ve got wood in streams.” We
1:11:28
might have the only big wood left in the streams, but it was no artifact.
1:11:32
That sent me back to the archives, and I started to look at streams
1:11:37
all over North America, via the Army Corps of Engineers snag records,
1:11:43
how they pulled wood out of streams.
1:11:45
I found the story of wood-dominated small streams was the same in West
1:11:50
Virginia and Appalachia as it was in Minnesota and Michigan, as much as it
1:11:56
was in the Gulf Coast of Mississippi or in St. Johns River in Florida.
1:12:01
Anywhere I looked, even the Wabash River of Indiana, if there was a
1:12:06
forest, it influenced the stream, not only in the leaf litter and the kind
1:12:11
of insect community, but the wood.
1:12:14
We usually took the big wood out because it took out bridges or plugged culverts.
1:12:26
The work here at the Andrews basically got people worldwide starting to
1:12:30
look at large wood in streams.
1:12:31
Not only as an essential part of maintaining habitat structure and
1:12:37
biodiversity options, but as that intimate link between forest and
1:12:45
stream.
1:12:45
This allowed for the slowing downstream transport of leaf litter as it was
1:12:51
trapped behind these debris jams, so it could persist long enough
1:12:55
to get processed and decomposed.
1:12:58
You then work through the total
1:13:05
stream community all the way up to the fish.
1:13:08
I think all those things interacted and worked together.
1:13:17
Then we got into Fred Swanson’s thing.
1:13:20
After you get a picture of a static budget, you find a major component like
1:13:24
logs, you also find a switch in energy resources, and you get to a larger stream.
1:13:30
Then you start to look and see what all these landslides are doing.
1:13:33
What are all these different geomorphic processes?
1:13:36
I think that’s where Fred really started to kick in big-time, was in the mid ‘80’s
1:13:42
and the ‘90’s, in that suddenly this dynamic landscape that we had in the
1:13:49
West, was important not only forests, but also worked within the river network.
1:13:57
It was a disturbance mechanism, but an essential one for providing
1:14:00
long-term fish habitat, and setting up situations which allowed more
1:14:07
wood to come in than just what was delivered from the adjacent stand.
1:14:10
The
1:14:13
ideas just kept evolving off of what was a simple budget exercise, drawing
1:14:19
up an accounting of carbon or nitrogen.
1:14:22
That led to a whole series of questions about the dynamics of wood, not only
1:14:26
it’s role, but what is the role of landslides or wind or fire in getting
1:14:34
wood into streams.
1:14:34
Those ideas found their way into the way we manage streams to maintain process
1:14:40
and structure in forests worldwide.
1:14:45
So, we had an intellectual component, but we also had a message
1:14:49
and a story to give back to the managers, which is being used today.
1:14:54
I want to get back to that in a second.
1:14:55
I wanted to ask clarification on one point.
1:14:57
You mentioned that someone had raised the point about the debris
1:15:01
of wood in the streams as an artifact of being of the West.
1:15:03
Who raised that, or what was the context?
1:15:06
At the time,
1:15:09
the people back East felt
1:15:15
we’d see wood here, but we probably wouldn’t see it anywhere else.
1:15:19
I don’t know whether they thought that it was all gone because of humans.
1:15:23
I remember Gene Likens and some of the East coast crowd, would say, “We’ve
1:15:32
got wood, but it’s more leg size or arm size than really big wood.” They
1:15:40
had never considered the trunks and the branches as a big part of their systems.
1:15:45
Well, Likens immediately saw that it couldn’t be missed in his forest, either.
1:15:51
He and Bob Bilby did a lot of very good work with wood.
1:15:55
But, we were told that it was just a western stream phenomena.
1:16:00
But our own work here and then the archival work we did, showed very
1:16:05
clearly that worldwide wood was a major component of streams and rivers.
1:16:12
For the Mississippi River, Mark Twain wrote books about it, and about the snags.
1:16:17
They made double-hulled boats in the 1830’s to the ‘60’s, so if the first
1:16:24
one got punctured, the boat didn’t sink, because it had a second hull.
1:16:27
That was a concern because you had huge amounts of wood in big rivers.
1:16:32
The Mississippi is our biggest river, and yet, between St. Louis and New
1:16:36
Orleans, in a 50-60 year period the Corps pulled out a million snags.
1:16:40
Well, those aren’t just sitting there waiting to bag a boat.
1:16:45
You had all sorts of biological organisms working off of those wood surfaces,
1:16:52
or the fish using that habitat or the structures functioning as a sorting
1:16:56
mechanism for fine organic material.
1:16:59
A number of
1:17:03
people then, folks like
1:17:07
Art Binky and Bruce Wallace in Georgia and then again Jack
1:17:12
Webster and some of the others at
1:17:16
Coweeta and Virginia Tech, started to pick up and work on this idea too.
1:17:21
But,
1:17:25
the Europeans never believed it at all.
1:17:29
You could go back into their archives and find out that as long
1:17:34
as rivers were highways, which they were, they had to be clean.
1:17:38
Theirs were just cleaned in the 14th century to get masts for war
1:17:44
machines in the form of naval boats and naval ships down the rivers.
1:17:49
So, when you went back there, they wouldn’t see much wood,
1:17:53
but where they left a forest, there you would still see it.
1:17:58
I’m still puzzled about the comment, “Artifact of the West.”
1:18:02
Well, it was because no one else had these great big pristine forests left.
1:18:07
They’ve all been fragmented, and particularly in the East coast, they’ve
1:18:10
gone through three or four rotations or
1:18:16
converted to farms from forests.
1:18:19
So, they just thought that this was something that would just be germane
1:18:25
to the forests of the Northwest, the big old-growth forests here.
1:18:30
The image I had was they had this vision of really sloppy
1:18:32
logging practices in the West.
1:18:34
They did, and there was no question that people were outraged when
1:18:38
they saw pictures of the West, showing all the slash in streams.
1:18:42
In fact, we got into the big wood story primarily off of that.
1:18:48
There was a study that Hank Froehlich was doing with a Swiss student.
1:18:53
And the issue was, we’re being asked to clean up these streams,
1:18:58
because of all the logging slash.
1:18:59
What if we felled trees away from streams and then we did a “before-and-after”
1:19:04
look at the amount of wood in the stream?
1:19:06
I saw that and I though, “Bingo!
1:19:08
They’re
1:19:10
looking at it to cut costs and to up the amount of fiber delivered to the mill.”
1:19:14
They figured if they felled uphill, they wouldn’t shatter the tree, and they’d
1:19:18
get more valuable logs out of the deal.
1:19:23
They were looking at the economics of it.
1:19:25
I was looking at it from an ecological perspective, so, and I said, “Well, these
1:19:28
people know how to measure this stuff, let’s just use their sampling techniques
1:19:32
and measure wood, because we’re interested in grams and kilograms of carbon
1:19:39
for organic matter budgeting.” Well then, that’s been brushed away, and Fred
1:19:42
Swanson came in and said, “Hey, these are big structural components also.”
1:19:48
We were more looking at them as tons of carbon and a way to measure them,
1:19:53
and it was really the impetus that Hank Froehlich and a couple of his students
1:19:58
that really got us into measuring wood systematically and in a big way.
1:20:02
And then considering its role in the ecosystem, in terms of storage
1:20:07
of organics or habitat or surfaces for other kinds of organisms.
1:20:11
Hank Froehlich, you said?
1:20:14
Hank Froehlich, yeah.
1:20:16
He was never part of the Andrews group.
1:20:17
We’d always argue about logging and sediment and things like that.
1:20:24
But
1:20:28
I would give him a lot of credit for us getting into the big wood
1:20:39
game.
1:20:39
I wanted to ask you if you could give me kind of a long-term perspective
1:20:44
from your situation of the changes in structure and focus in areas of
1:20:50
the Andrews group and its leadership,
1:20:54
since 1971 when you first got here.
1:20:57
Before then, there was no question up until probably close to 1980,
1:21:06
it was a two-person show, Jerry and Dick Waring.
1:21:09
They both did very different kinds of things, but they
1:21:12
functioned very well as a team.
1:21:14
And then Dick had his own interests, and Jerry did too, but Jerry’s been
1:21:19
the spiritual father keeping the Andrews going, and that’s his thing.
1:21:23
He really passed that torch onto Fred Swanson, as nobody wanted to
1:21:28
pick it up after Jerry, just because, well, Jerry is hard to replace.
1:21:34
But, Fred stepped up, and Fred’s passion is keeping the Andrews going.
1:21:40
What I see now is that we have got to take some of our mid-career scientists,
1:21:48
many of them on soft money, and find institutional homes for them.
1:21:52
Either at Oregon State or within PNW, or together, to pass the torch.
1:21:58
Fred’s burning out, just like Jerry did, and you need someone else with a
1:22:04
little fire in the belly and commitment.
1:22:07
It’s a labor of love to keep that going because, the headaches of
1:22:12
facilities, the headaches of personnel;
1:22:17
they take a toll.
1:22:18
And always coming up with a new intellectual idea.
1:22:22
I think that the succession’s been pretty good.
1:22:26
Fred’s done a superb job, but Jerry hasn’t gone away, and when they need to
1:22:32
pull in Jerry, they do, and Jerry has stayed involved in the LTER network.
1:22:37
He’s
1:22:40
looked after the group from a different vantage point, and he’s not uninterested,
1:22:46
he’s just not intimately engaged in the day-to-day or in getting the new
1:22:50
grant prepared and things like that.
1:22:53
But he’s committed to the place, both intellectually
1:22:56
and that it’s just a passion.
1:23:00
It’s a huge legacy.
1:23:01
I think his research natural areas work and the work he did at the Andrews,
1:23:07
that’ll be the long-lasting legacy, in my opinion, of Jerry Franklin.
1:23:11
And the work he did with describing forests, and what his students
1:23:18
have done; it’s been superb.
1:23:20
And Fred Swanson will do the same.
1:23:22
He’s kept the group together, and there is a cadre that wants to stay together
1:23:27
that just does not want to leave it.
1:23:29
That group now is a position where they’re going to have to make a transition.
1:23:35
Fred is tired, he needs a break, and some new people have to step up.
1:23:41
I think the institutions of Oregon State [University] and the Pacific
1:23:45
Northwest Research Station, if in fact we want this to go forward, have got
1:23:48
an obligation to get those people on a harder-money base, so that they can
1:23:54
devote themselves full-time, not to securing their own funding, but they can
1:23:59
devote their time to facilitating the group and taking care of those details
1:24:04
that Fred and Jerry did all these years.
1:24:10
So, it’s changed.
1:24:11
It’s much more diverse group than it was.
1:24:14
It was a little family back in the ‘70’s, looked over by the teutonic
1:24:22
“captain midnight” Dick Waring,
1:24:27
and this effervescent arm-waver and synthesizer in Jerry Franklin. I mean,
1:24:33
Jerry just totally amazed me the first few years that he could sit down like
1:24:38
you and I are doing now, and say, “Well, tell me what you’ve learned.
1:24:41
What to do you think.
1:24:42
What’s your story?” You’d reel off a storyline, he’d take some
1:24:46
notes, and then he’d write it.
1:24:48
He was a very good writer and he knew how to get right to the “splash.” So, he
1:24:55
was very good at marketing the Andrews as well as keeping and attracting people,
1:25:00
and Dick, who may not be as good a marketer, but had major contributions
1:25:04
in certain areas. I think the Andrews has got to keep up that marketing, if
1:25:11
it’s going to survive in the long term.
1:25:16
I think the mid-career people are ready to give it a go, and I think the institutions
1:25:20
now have to step up and help it out.
1:25:25
The way you characterize this is that this is a group that attracts people, and once
1:25:27
they leave they don’t ever really leave.
1:25:29
I don’t think so.
1:25:30
If you got to a meeting of the North American Benthological Society or ESA
1:25:33
[Ecological Society of America] , we’d talk about old times as if it never quit.
1:25:41
Many of us still interact professionally together on grants or papers, or in
1:25:49
my position now, I’ll contract with people like Bob Wissmar, Stan Gregory
1:25:57
or Chuck Hawkins at Utah State.
1:26:02
They’ve gone their different ways, and yet you come back, and the
1:26:07
feelings are all very, very positive.
1:26:10
I just could not imagine a better launch to my career than to have come
1:26:15
here, and I didn’t know it at the time.
1:26:18
To have people like Jerry and Dick look after me
1:26:24
when I when I left Oregon State and went to Weyerhaeuser, and to
1:26:28
look after me when I came back!
1:26:30
I mean you can’t ask for more than that.
1:26:33
They just did that, and that was because there was a sense
1:26:37
of commitment to one another.
1:26:40
Several people have used this term, the Georgia Mafia, to describe the way
1:26:45
that people go to Georgia [University of Georgia] , and then go from
1:26:47
there to get leadership positions.
1:26:49
Do you see things like that happening with this group?
1:26:51
Yeah, I think that
1:26:54
the group has put out a lot of
1:27:00
people.
1:27:00
But this here is the place that people send people to learn how to
1:27:01
do interdisciplinary work together.
1:27:04
Because, while the Georgia Mafia is very, very good, I think that the Andrews
1:27:12
group has done an incredible job also.
1:27:17
If people in stream research want to see how to interact, they came here.
1:27:23
Because people were open,
1:27:26
there was
1:27:29
a feeling of excitement and a lot of things happening.
1:27:33
I’m not putting Georgia down at all, they do put out good leaders, and I
1:27:38
think this place has put out, I think people have through here have also been
1:27:41
highly successful, wherever they’ve gone.
1:27:43
Some
1:27:45
are now leaders in international limnological circles.
1:27:50
Like Amy Ward, Ken Cummins still feels a connectedness to
1:27:58
the Andrews and Oregon State.
1:28:00
And Charles Hawkins at Utah State.
1:28:05
All of them have carved out very good careers.
1:28:07
Also Cliff Dahm at University of New Mexico.
1:28:11
So the problem isn’t that leaders aren’t available here, it’s
1:28:14
that the funding is lacking?
1:28:16
Well, I think each primary institution here has to have someone that says, “Hey,
1:28:23
there’s a commitment to keep this thing going.” And right now, in the early
1:28:29
stages that was shared, and then it got more shared as the post-docs got
1:28:33
empowered so the workload gets divvied up.
1:28:36
Jerry could focus on what he did best, and Dick could too, and we all fed into that.
1:28:46
Jerry had the primary responsibility in the original LTERs,
1:28:51
and then passed that on to Fred.
1:28:53
Well, it’s more than a one person show now, it’s too big.
1:28:57
You’ve got to have insiders work to move the program forward.
1:29:00
And they can still attract the Georgia Mafia, the Hubbard
1:29:05
Brooks, and other places.
1:29:06
That’s what the LTER system is doing.
1:29:09
It’s a lot of collaboration between the different groups in the LTER network.
1:29:14
But that’s going to take more than just one person.
1:29:19
And I think people like Mark Harmon or Barbara [Bond] Yoder are the
1:29:22
type of people that Oregon State and Pacific Northwest Research Station
1:29:26
ought to make offers to as full faculty members, and they assume
1:29:31
the leadership into the next decade.
1:29:35
Will
1:29:37
Fred Swanson go away?
1:29:39
Not on your life, and Jerry Franklin too.
1:29:43
And so, they can still rely on those two, but I think it’s time
1:29:50
for the institutions to step up.
1:29:51
The institution says, “This has been good to us,” both, for the Forest
1:29:57
Service and for Oregon State, and I think they’re going to have to
1:30:00
step up, and put some money into
1:30:08
that.
1:30:13
What is
1:30:15
your perception as a scientist of who your primary audience is, and how that relates
1:30:20
to the kind of science that you do?
1:30:26
The public.
1:30:27
I’ve
1:30:31
been criticized for that.
1:30:32
I’m a marketer.
1:30:34
I like to take
1:30:37
the ideas that we’ve come up with, put them in real simple form,
1:30:43
and give them with a punch line.
1:30:45
And so that if it’s the governor, if it’s the Garden Club, or the Rotary
1:30:50
Club or the Kiwanis Club, or some member of the Ecological Society,
1:30:54
they understand what we’re doing.
1:30:56
In a sense, that takes the mystery out of it, and shows
1:30:59
that, in fact, we are relevant.
1:31:00
We’re just not bunch of people that go off and talk about
1:31:05
chaos theory to our colleagues.
1:31:12
I’m not particularly good about chaos theory, even though my
1:31:15
office is chaos [chuckle].
1:31:18
So, I look more at translation and seeing how do we make the work relevant.
1:31:23
How do we distill it down to the good ideas?
1:31:27
I learned that from Jerry Franklin.
1:31:30
Jerry is very good about distilling a story down to an essence, or getting some
1:31:34
defining statement or experiment that has some splash that you can rally around.
1:31:44
I think that has served the Andrews well and it serves science well because
1:31:48
it has allowed more people access to say, “This place is relevant to
1:31:52
us.” Then I look at translating a lot of the work, particularly what
1:31:57
the Andrews has done, to managers.
1:32:00
How get do we get that thinking into how to manage forests?
1:32:04
A good share of my work the last ten, fifteen years, has been, in fact, adding
1:32:11
to some new knowledge, but as much translating to managers and saying, “This
1:32:15
is real, you’ve got to manage to maintain this or restore it or preserve it.”
1:32:24
So, that’s where I come from.
1:32:27
Who are some of the managers you’ve worked with most closely with
1:32:32
the last few years?
1:32:32
I’ve been really fortunate.
1:32:35
It started out working with district rangers of national forests.
1:32:39
But, in the last five or six years it’s been the chief of the Forest
1:32:43
Service, director of BLM, regional foresters, state directors, governors.
1:32:49
So, national level?
1:32:50
It’s at the national level.
1:32:55
Stan Gregory is on sabbatical now working on wood in streams.
1:32:59
And working with Europeans who are trying to get a six or seven
1:33:05
country proposal, on the role of wood in woodland streams in Europe.
1:33:10
They’re saying, “Here’s all this North American stuff, does it really work here?
1:33:16
Given our culture and what we’ve got left?” And, there’s no doubt
1:33:19
in my mind it’s going to work.
1:33:22
Change some of those Napoleonic laws that require all streams be cleaned of wood.
1:33:29
I feel like this place
1:33:33
– the Andrews – has given me a platform to speak to scientists at the highest
1:33:39
levels of NSF and in science forums.
1:33:42
And it’s also given me a forum to speak very authoritatively in
1:33:47
the huge debates over how we’re going to manage natural resources.
1:33:56
I think, you’ll relate to this theme I would like you to address.
1:34:01
I’ve asked this question of most people I’ve interviewed, to get a sense of
1:34:04
how this concept has changed over time.
1:34:08
Maybe you could tell me how you would, at this point in your career, differentiate
1:34:12
the relative priorities between applied research and basic science, and how
1:34:16
would you characterize the distinction?
1:34:18
Well, I think you need to mix them.
1:34:22
The thing about the Andrews was, you had some people doing some pretty esoteric
1:34:26
work, and they were all part of the group.
1:34:28
And you had people that weren’t particularly inclined to talk to
1:34:32
managers, and now I’ve found in the last several years, they’re out
1:34:38
there talking to managers.
1:34:38
These distinctions are really breaking down.
1:34:39
I think, particularly in ecosystem science
1:34:44
and forests and streams, that, as soon as we learn some new things
1:34:50
about the ecosystem basic-wise, they’re almost always immediately
1:34:56
relevant on the applied side.
1:34:58
And then, it’s a matter of well how far can we extend this?
1:35:01
How far can we go?
1:35:02
And in some cases, it seems so intuitively obvious that we have to go
1:35:07
forward and overplay the hand, and the science catches up, we’re shoring it up.
1:35:12
In some places, the management is so hungry for any information, that our
1:35:20
information is on a time trajectory and they want to take this slice and
1:35:24
they try to modify strains or forests, and it’s just the wrong thing to do,
1:35:31
because we didn’t get the whole picture.
1:35:34
I really think that
1:35:37
the basic vs.
1:35:38
applied distinctions are blurring.
1:35:41
And there’s no question that technologically, we’re entering
1:35:45
into much more sophisticated math and modeling and remote sensing.
1:35:50
Also
1:35:53
chemical analysis, and that’s telling a story we didn’t know before, but
1:36:00
that’s playing right into the management and the robustness of the story.
1:36:05
I don’t see a whole lot of difference.
1:36:08
I see that Forest Service research is moving more towards applied,
1:36:14
and that might be just part of the times, given this Congress and
1:36:17
fact we’re in a major transition in the way we’re managing forests.
1:36:24
With incomplete knowledge, people want what we do know translated.
1:36:29
Then there’ll be a period where we’ve run out, the Schlitz is gone, we’re
1:36:33
gonna have to develop some new beer.
1:36:36
And I see that the pendulum will swing back to the fundamental side.
1:36:42
For now it sounds like [end of question covered over by Sedell’s response]
1:36:45
I think
1:36:48
the relevancy to the policy issues is really going to keep funding going.
1:36:53
But
1:36:56
the National Science Foundation, you can see their new programs
1:36:58
emphasizing the sociological impacts
1:37:03
of forests and some of the economics.
1:37:07
They’re trying to get more integrative of the social sciences
1:37:11
within the basic sciences.
1:37:13
And I say that this place will go the same way.
1:37:15
Now you say, “Well, is this basic research or applied research?” I think it’s a lot
1:37:20
of basic, we don’t have the tools and in many ways the concepts, to integrate
1:37:23
social, economic and ecosystem processes.
1:37:26
It might be that it’s always going to be apples and oranges, but
1:37:30
everyone’s trying to see how they can integrate it better than we’ve done.
1:37:34
And those are going to end up immediately as applied tools through policy makers
1:37:39
to weigh risks and opportunities.
1:37:45
That’s going to take some basic research in some fields that haven’t
1:37:48
traditionally been in ecosystem science.
1:37:51
So, there’s relevance to policy issues in funding lines, but
1:37:54
it also raises new questions.
1:37:55
Oh yeah.
1:37:56
I think there’s a push-pull, and in many ways in this current
1:37:58
“basic vs. applied” debate, is like
1:38:01
the old debates of the early ‘70’s we used to have with Dick
1:38:06
and Jerry. Jerry’s a natural historian and descriptive ecologist.
1:38:13
I’m the same way.
1:38:15
Well, the experimentalists, if you weren’t describing what was going on
1:38:19
and giving them an idea of what the world was, very often, the experiments
1:38:24
would be a lot less meaningful.
1:38:25
So, once you give them the hypothesis or description, they say, “If that’s so,
1:38:32
then we ought to be able to find this, this and this.” They set up the experiment
1:38:37
to falsify or see where they lead.
1:38:41
I think you need ‘em, just like theoretical physics needs people to spend
1:38:47
their time blasting gold or platinum with high energy particles to see whether you
1:38:52
can get a statistical pattern that fits.
1:38:54
So, you need the descriptive parts, you need the theory parts, and
1:38:59
you need the experimental parts.
1:39:02
I think that at different times, the science community has tried to
1:39:05
emphasize one or look down on the other, but in the long run, it’s a mix.
1:39:13
I see the “applied vs. basic” as the same mix.
1:39:16
Right now, I’m more interested in saying, “What do you have that I can apply?” At
1:39:20
least, that’s where I’m at in my career.
1:39:22
But, we fund a lot of basic research.
1:39:25
So, what you’re saying is that dichotomy has always really
1:39:28
been there in this group?
1:39:29
I think so.
1:39:29
And it’s always been an element of
1:39:34
this group.
1:39:36
Maybe you could give me your encapsulation of how you would
1:39:38
characterize the relative success of the Andrews group to market what it
1:39:42
is that they do as a group over time?
1:39:46
I think within the science community, they’ve done a superb job, and within
1:39:51
the Forest Service the last ten years, they’ve established themselves as
1:39:58
a relevant player to the Willamette National Forest within the region.
1:40:05
I think what
1:40:08
we’ve learned collectively on the Andrews, has been the foundation
1:40:12
for some of the huge changes in forest management that have gone on
1:40:16
in the West and are rolling East.
1:40:19
There’s no question that on the collective understanding of streams
1:40:27
and forests and geomorphology and wood, they’ve had a major influence.
1:40:33
And the owl, because Eric Forsman originally did his work there
1:40:37
in the Andrews, has been a
1:40:41
cornerstone for allowing major policy shifts.
1:40:46
And
1:40:51
that came out of fundamental science, it didn’t come out
1:40:53
of industry-financed science.
1:40:56
In many ways, a lot of what the industry was funding was, “How can we
1:41:05
up production, cut costs, or what’s the minimum we need, as opposed to say
1:41:09
how does the system work, and are we doing the things that keep the system
1:41:13
working that way.” It’s kind of like agriculture with the chemicals. A lot
1:41:19
of research in agriculture was around chemicals and what are minimums,
1:41:23
what are maximums, and not what it’s going to take to keep soil fertile.
1:41:30
That foundation, when people were tired of the clear-cuts and we
1:41:35
were running out of the old trees, then became the cornerstone.
1:41:42
We could say, “Hey, this is what people think about how an old
1:41:46
growth forest works.” And that all stemmed out of a bunch of us sitting
1:41:50
around in 1979 or ‘80, or was it ‘77-’78, at Wind River Experimental

Forest, and Jerry Franklin and I
1:42:02
were there with about six or eight of us authors that put together this book
1:42:05
on the characteristics and function of old-growth forests. That was just
1:42:11
synthesizing bits and pieces that we’d all done, to put it into a coherent story.
1:42:16
That was the first look at those forests that way [Ecological
1:42:19
Characteristics of Old-growth Douglas-fir Forests, Franklin, et.
1:42:20
al.,] I think that
1:42:23
little government technical report had more to do with focusing on
1:42:31
old-growth forests than anything.
1:42:33
Subsequently, they’ve sent more books out, but that was the pivotal
1:42:36
book right around 1980, and that all came out of basic research.
1:42:41
Then people started to ask, “How do we manage to maintain any of these
1:42:45
processes or some of these features, these structural features,” and it certainly
1:42:50
influenced the way we managed streams.
1:42:53
Those were scientists who wrote that synthesis, is that right?
1:42:57
Right, and just to summarize what was known about
1:42:58
old-growth forests and streams.
1:42:58
Jerry put it together in his own wonderful style, and it was highly readable.
1:43:03
Managers can pick that up and understand the implications of it.
1:43:08
I gather from what you’re saying that the Andrews has been critical to this shift
1:43:12
in thinking about ecosystem management.
1:43:13
No question.
1:43:15
But, is it recognized outside of the scientific community as
1:43:19
being central in that shift?
1:43:21
Well, I think the managers here know it is when they stop to think about it.
1:43:29
A lot of things in the policy arena are moving fast.
1:43:32
And when you start to look at documents like FEMAT [Forest Ecosystem
1:43:35
Management Assessment Team] report, which was the foundation of the
1:43:36
Northwest Forest Plan, the fundamental citations are out of the Andrews.
1:43:40
That’s not saying other people haven’t done things, they have,
1:43:44
and that’s fed into it, too.
1:43:46
But in terms of a collective, these people have been instrumental.
1:43:51
I mean, Jerry Franklin, Stan Gregory, Gordon Grant, Fred Swanson, Tom
1:44:00
Spies, Dave Perry, have all been major players in the policy debates.
1:44:13
I think I’ll let you go with that.
