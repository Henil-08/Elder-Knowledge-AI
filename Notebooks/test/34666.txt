00:00
I’d like to start out with a little bit of background, your academic
00:00
background, that kind of thing, and how you came to be involved here.
00:00
You started out here OSU as faculty in 1977.
00:00
Could you talk about the origins of that move, and your personal academic
00:00
interest at that point to be here?
00:00
I’d just been trying to remember what I did since I left here.
00:00
I think it was 1973.
00:00
At that time, I was hired at the University of Washington to work on
00:00
the Coniferous Forest Biome project.
00:00
One of my jobs was to build models for the Andrews; the other half of
00:00
my job was to help with the [Univ.
00:01
of] Washington program] , which was the other IBP site.
00:03
I was spending half my time here working with the Andrews people,
00:04
and about half my time working in Seattle, from about 1973 to
00:06
1975
00:31
or so.
00:32
In ‘75
01:39
I moved down here full time, but continued to be paid by the
01:44
University of Washington, and then in
01:49
1976, the appointment was made to switch over to OSU.
01:53
Chuck Grier went up to U of W at that time.
01:58
We did a switch.
02:01
Chuck went up there, and I went up here.
02:04
We actually swapped salaries.
02:08
In fact, I started here
02:18
in ’73; it might have been ‘72.
02:19
How did you become involved in the IBP program in the first place?
02:30
I was in graduate school at Oakridge National Laboratories working on my
02:36
Ph.D. there, funded by the Eastern Deciduous Forest Biome, one of the
02:41
other 5 or 6 U.S. IBP programs.
02:50
Through that work I met Jerry Franklin, and I met Doug Chapman
02:55
at the U of W, who was in charge of modeling for the whole program, and
03:02
I met Dick Waring and Chuck Grier.
03:06
I think that might be everybody I met from out here.
03:13
No, I met Bill
03:16
Mendelson, because he was a professor at Swarthmore where I did my
03:19
undergraduate, and he was out here
03:24
by then, and also Mike Newton, because he spent a sabbatical at Oakridge
03:28
while I was a graduate student there.
03:29
I had a bunch of contacts with the people out here about ‘69 or ’70.
03:39
Dick and Mike brought me out here to interview for a post-doc,
03:45
I stayed at Mike Newton’s house,
03:50
interviewed, and was offered the post- doc and turned it down.
03:54
I elected to stay at Oakridge instead.
03:57
Why was that?
03:59
I just had a whole bunch of things I was working on there, and felt like I
04:05
wanted to finish what I’d was doing.
04:11
Oakridge offered a good deal - much money, so why not do it?
04:18
Later, I became increasingly disenchanted with
04:22
Oakridge and started to look for a number of options out here, and I discovered
04:30
that there was a job available out here.
04:33
At the same time, I wrote to Jerry Franklin and asked him if the previous
04:42
offer was still available, and he said it was probably available as
04:49
a half-time job down in Corvallis, and when can I get after it.
04:55
At the same time, I saw this advertisement for a visiting professor that I made out
04:58
that they were looking for a fellow up at
05:01
the University of Washington.
05:04
Since I knew Doug Chapman, respected him a great deal and really liked the idea
05:09
with working with him, I called up the University of Washington, and they said
05:16
sure, when could I come to interview?
05:19
When I got out here, I discovered that I was in Stan Gessel’s office,
05:24
the head of the whole IBP program out here, and that they’d flown me
05:28
out to interview for a job that Jerry Franklin had already offered me.
05:37
Stan said, “Why in hell did we fly this guy out here if Jerry Franklin
05:41
has already offered him the job?”
05:43
Even at the half-time position?
05:46
I didn’t connect Jerry’s offering me a half-time position with this full-time job
05:52
available at the University of Washington.
05:54
I didn’t know it was the same money.
05:57
I had no way of knowing.
05:58
First thing I knew, the boss was pissed off at me for coming out here
06:03
for a job I was already offered.
06:08
So, anyway, that’s how I came to be here.
06:13
Where you from originally?
06:15
Where was I born?
06:17
Los Angeles.
06:18
Oh, yeah.
06:20
I
06:23
grew up in Puerto Rico, and then in summers,
06:34
worked at Luquillo, which is now an LTER site.
06:40
So, I started working at an LTER site almost 34 years ago.
06:42
I lived in New York and
07:04
did my undergraduate at Swarthmore and graduate school at University of North
07:09
Carolina-Chapel Hill and the University of Tennessee, which was really a fellowship
07:15
from the Oakridge National Laboratory.
07:20
Now, except for a few years on the University of Washington
07:24
payroll, I‘ve been here ever since, except two years I spent at
07:32
Yale as a visiting professor, during which I worked
07:40
with the forestry department out there.
07:41
I came back when this place was more ready to hire me into a
07:49
real position.
07:51
I
07:58
have a very weird kind of pedigree.
08:03
Lot of different regions.
08:05
Lot of different regions, levels.
08:07
I did a lot of forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards
08:11
Were you researching things
08:15
consistently at the time?
08:21
To me, it was always a natural progression.
08:25
The work I did on the El Verde Rainforest Project [In El Yunque
08:25
N.F. in Puerto Rico] was on nutrient cycling, biomass estimation,
08:25
stem flow, and water chemistry.
08:25
I did a lot of computer programs for them in the early ‘60’s.
08:25
So, I had an interest in computers.
08:33
I had an interest in math.
08:42
I was sort of a dual chemistry-biology major in college, and when I got
09:13
to grad school, I was working with Tom Odum.
09:17
I got a lot of encouragement to study math, systems analysis, programming
09:25
and computers, that kind of stuff.
09:28
I didn’t know much about this stuff, and Tom didn’t know much
09:31
about this stuff either, but he encouraged us to come and learn.
09:35
It was really good.
09:41
He was interested in nutrient-cycling and chemistry, so primary
09:45
production was easier to learn.
09:48
His idea was to calculate how much
09:54
carbon a tree was fixing, and once that’s learned, that’s useful information.
09:55
That’s pretty easy.
09:57
Trying to understand phosphorous chemistry itself, is a lot harder.
10:00
I started to read these things about biomass and worked with that for
10:12
my Ph.D. As I got out here, I moved from carbon-cycling into an energy project
10:18
in hydrology, modeling energy budgets
10:27
and nutrient-cycling issues.
10:30
That got
10:37
me more interested in nutrient-cycling.
10:37
That is why I started looking into
10:41
proton budgets or hydrogen budgets, to try to make sense
10:51
of soil
11:03
pH.
11:03
I’m not sure it happened, but I started getting more and more interested in soils.
11:07
And a guy by the name of Gody Spycher came along.
11:07
Gody came to me one day in 1977.
11:07
This was after the biome came to an end at the Andrews.
11:08
We were trying to learn about writing grants on our own.
11:08
He said they have a great grant proposal, and here’s what I want to do.
11:09
I said this could be really important.
11:09
So, I helped him write a grant proposal, and we got
11:21
it funded – the first “flawless” proposal funded ever by NSF.
11:23
This was after
11:42
you’d
11:58
come down here?
11:59
Yeah, this was about 1978; we must have written it the year before.
12:08
If it wasn’t the first, it was one of the
12:13
first [funded proposal by non-soils PI] , and I’ve been
12:16
told that it might be the first.
12:18
It really shook them up.
12:19
They never had anybody with a real soils background, and the proposal
12:29
to work on their ecosystems before.
12:29
I didn’t have a soils background, but Gody did his Ph.D. in soils.
12:35
We got the money and did the work at Mount Shasta and Grande Peaks,
12:37
and wrote a whole bunch of papers.
12:37
That helped us understand how soil and organic matter worked.
12:41
In the process, we
12:54
learned the rates which carbon dioxide
12:58
was released for
13:06
plant growth.
13:06
Gody and I kept plugging away on it.
13:08
Gody dropped out.
13:09
He just decided this grant proposal writing wasn’t for him.
13:12
Next time, we submitted a grant proposal, it didn’t get funded.
13:14
That was a grant proposal that was way ahead of its time.
13:16
Now, we’d be able to get funded
13:18
What was the focus?
13:21
There were two components to it.
13:21
It was too big and it took 35 years.
13:23
One was using algebraic analysis
13:29
to understand soil development.
13:30
That was 10-15 years ahead of it’s time.
13:30
The other was using new chemical techniques that had
13:30
just emerged for looking at
14:03
the constituents.
14:06
In those days, people felt the only thing worth doing was developing the
14:08
soil as a strong base or strong acid, and somehow precipitating it out.
14:15
The problems are; we can’t really infer anything useful from that,
14:19
it alters the system, and doesn’t bear any claims to nutrients, and
14:19
it’s been partially abandoned and replaced by this new technique.
14:20
Gody is
14:28
the one who got me
15:03
started on all
15:06
this.
15:09
With this pure interest in soils, I went from that to getting interested
15:14
again in the tropics, and went down to Puerto Rico, working on excuses to
15:21
get back to the tropics, personally.
15:23
I discovered out
15:27
how little
15:30
the tropical ecosystem scientists knew about soils, less than the
15:32
temperate-system scientists do, and there was less contact between tropical-soils
15:36
people and tropical ecology people than there was between temperate-soils
15:40
people and temperate-system ecologists.
15:43
So, there was a fertile field to go try to do address something with.
15:49
What was the reason for that state of tropical forest science?
15:55
Tropical soils people are predominately agriculturally-oriented, and
16:01
tropical ecologists I think, are anti-tropical agriculture
16:11
in those general areas, or they were in those days, and tropical soils
16:12
people were anti-conservation in those days, and [against] people
16:15
interested in conservation and
16:19
preservation, and anything like that.
16:21
There was no blood lost between these various camps, so there were
16:29
all kinds of good reasons for not coming in contact accidentally.
16:33
It took people a pretty substantial effort to get together.
16:40
This
16:42
is all not a serious problem
16:46
anymore.
16:47
Was this a problem in the temperate areas also?
16:48
It was less of a problem in the temperate areas for two reasons.
16:53
There’s a huge legacy of so-called forest soils people, and they
16:59
were very active in forest soil.
17:03
People like Earl Stone in this country, probably
17:09
the living grandfather at this point for
17:14
this kind of concerted collaboration, and a guy by the name of Carl Olaf
17:15
Tom in Sweden, whose father Olaf Tom
17:21
was from back in the ‘30’s.
17:24
Many other
17:26
people in soils worked closely with foresters, and foresters
17:30
tended to work with forest ecologists and that wasn’t this, as
17:30
ecologists tend to work on forests
17:37
in general, and they
17:40
tended to work with foresters.
17:41
Everybody who worked with forests
18:01
considered the soil a part of this ecosystem; it wasn’t a separate entity.
18:09
In agricultural lands, grassland ecologists for the most part
18:21
had nothing to do with people growing
18:25
crops.
18:27
They might talk to the range people, and they might talk to the range
18:29
ecologists, although in the 1970’s the concept of range ecologists
18:29
might be a little premature, and there were some people that called
18:29
themselves range ecologists, but for
18:45
the soils people, most of the money for soils work was
18:53
from farmers.
18:53
At ag research stations, these people were doing row crops of corn or
18:58
wheat, annual type of agriculture, Ecologists didn’t have any
19:06
interest in annual agriculture, so there was this huge gap between the
19:12
people doing really excellent work in soil chemistry and soils organic
19:18
matter, but doing it with corn, wheat, soybean, and particularly wheat,
19:25
and the rest of the community down there – the ecologists and ecosystems people.
19:31
The place that first came together was Colorado State [Univ.]
19:34
and the biome [IBP] out there.
19:43
There was also a Canadian project in which
19:46
those two groups worked very closely together
19:49
What were the Canadian group?
19:50
Matador.
19:52
That was Elder Paul, in particular.
19:54
It was an early age for me, a more advanced age for him,
20:04
so I ended up doing a lot, working for people in the various grasslands
20:10
projects; Elder, Merncall, Dave Coleman,
20:17
Bob Creel,
20:23
John Steward, Norm Teases, a bunch of people famous in temperate zone
20:24
agriculture, but, who wouldn’t consider themselves to be in agriculture, and who
20:24
wouldn’t consider themselves ecologists.
20:24
They would consider themselves soil scientists, or Creel
20:45
would consider himself to be an ecologist, and the rest
20:52
wouldn’t.
20:52
The more of us that did this [interdisciplinary work] , the more it
20:55
helped breakdown the gap between the soils community and ecosystems community.
20:59
The
21:03
gap exists to this day.
21:06
There are all kinds of politics
21:12
between the soils community and ecologists.
21:12
I can get into that if you want to.
21:13
Anything likely relevant to the tropics?
21:20
Relative to the tropics, more of the people were associated
21:25
with agriculture there.
21:29
That is what lured you back into temperate studies then?
21:34
What lured me back to the tropics?
21:36
I’m sorry, I ‘m trying to remember where we started off.
21:39
Well, in the early eighties I got involved in a whole lot of tropical research,
21:44
because I realized what I was learning and what people were thinking of how
21:47
tropical soils worked, was completely unknown to the tropical ecologists.
21:52
I could do a project and get money because I could put the money to do
22:03
tropical soil work.
22:03
It wasn’t old hat to the tropical soils people, it was somewhat cutting-edge for
22:05
them, but it was totally beyond anything that the tropical ecology community
22:10
ever thought about or heard about.
22:13
We got a lot of money
22:19
to work in Costa Rica.
22:19
Did that pull you away from your involvement up here more?
22:21
Yeah, which was good, too.
22:25
There’s stuff we can talk to about what my involvement
22:32
has
22:37
been through the years.
22:39
It hasn’t always been my focus, as with people here.
22:43
Maybe you can talk a little bit here about your first questions you had about
22:47
Andrews when they brought you around?
22:53
Other that the big trees?
22:54
Yeah.
22:56
[Laughter]
22:56
Well, I spent a lot of time in the West before that.
22:59
I
23:01
was in California until I was eight, so we had camped in the
23:04
Redwoods in the forties and fifties.
23:07
Certainly, some big trees and some bigger trees.
23:10
That was nice, but it wasn’t anything unusual.
23:14
Every summer, I had been climbing
23:18
up in the West, in the Rockies and up in to the Cascades and Canada,
23:22
and so I knew the western forests.
23:26
Things were certainly wetter, but they were not as wet as the tropical forests.
23:34
It was an interesting sort of combination for
23:39
me; aspects of the western Rocky Mountain forests, the California Redwoods,
23:45
the Canadian wet forests that I had seen, and the tropical rain forests.
23:53
Did they take you down to the Andrews?
23:55
Yeah.
23:55
I saw Watershed 2 and walked around.
23:55
I’m probably sure we
23:59
saw Watershed 10.
24:07
I’m
24:10
sure Dick took me down there.
24:14
Dick Waring.
24:15
Did
24:18
you stay overnight down there or did you do a quick tour?
24:20
It was just for
24:23
the day.
24:29
By comparison from what you were doing in the Eastern Deciduous Biome,
24:36
what was your impression of the scientists [at the Andrews Forest] at that time?
24:39
Well, you’ve got to understand, I was comparing life here,
24:49
to Oakridge National Lab, which was at the time and still is fairly described
24:58
as a cross between Boy Scouts of America and [unintelligible] , with
25:04
the worse features of both.
25:06
Lots of resources, lots of equipment, lots of very good
25:10
people, but a security-oriented
25:17
mentally and a very structured organization, and people taking orders,
25:22
and you get notes like, “I was here at eight in the morning, where were you?”
25:26
I got here and I was surrounded by an endless expanse of dope smoking hippies,
25:34
and everybody having a great time.
25:38
I found this to be fun.
25:41
It was this was a nice change, and besides, I had mountains out
25:46
here to go climb, and I was pretty bored with the hiking and the
25:51
climbing I could do in the East.
25:53
My marriage had broken up and I was ready to go out there
25:59
and go live somewhere else.
26:04
This was the time you accepted the job, or turned it down?
26:06
The time I accepted it.
26:07
Oh, okay.
26:07
The time that I turned it down,
26:13
I was laboring under the impression that life at Oakridge would be the
26:14
same as life as a graduate student.
26:17
Life as a graduate
26:20
student, you have all the resources, you’re not regarded as part of a
26:25
hierarchy, and people don’t ask you
26:28
where you were at eight o’clock in the morning.
26:32
Then, when you get a real staff position, they feel they have the right to inspect
26:37
certain kinds of professional behavior.
26:39
I think they’ve loosened up a bit.
26:43
Lots of people have left the place because they couldn’t deal with the
26:48
authoritarian kind of structure.
26:52
Is that still true back there?
26:54
That people still leave occasionally?
26:59
[Laughter] That’s what they tell me.
27:00
I don’t know.
27:01
I’m not that curious.
27:02
So, what you’re saying is, the reason you came out here was the atmosphere?
27:09
The lack of authoritarian structure, and I was really excited about it
27:14
[HJA/new position] . I was given an enormous amount of resources.
27:18
Probably too much for someone who was 27 years old or however
27:21
old I was at the time, to handle effectively or efficiently.
27:27
But that didn’t stop it for being very exciting at the time.
27:31
It was later that I realized that I was probably given too much freedom.
27:36
At the time, it seemed great.
27:39
I was really excited about what we were building.
27:42
State-of-the-art, trips to Europe, and things like that, to meet with people.
28:07
Petty stuff, petty stuff, but whatever, it was fun.
28:12
Good people.
28:13
Really good people.
28:13
People working really hard.
28:16
What was your perception at the time of the standard role of the experimental
28:20
forest and how does the Andrews fit into that kind of model of expectations?
28:20
Where I worked in Puerto Rico was an experimental forest [Luquillo] , also.
28:21
I had no doubt in my mind that experimental forests were good things.
28:22
I knew about a hundred books from them, and I had been to Fernow [Experimental
28:50
Forest]
29:02
in West Virginia.
29:05
Chuck Grier
29:09
was working at Cascade Head [Experimental Forest] at the time, too.
29:12
I‘d been out there with him and knew that these were good things.
29:18
I guess my
29:27
feeling is, still to this day, the
29:34
experimental forest concept is a really good one.
29:38
The only [potential negative] side of this, is it occasionally seems
29:42
like the real estate can drive the research, instead of the research
29:50
working for the right real estate.
29:54
I think there were occasionally times when we sited things
30:00
because it was good for the Andrews, but not necessarily the
30:04
best place to do the research.
30:09
I don’t think that’s good.
30:10
I think most of the time it works out well that the Andrews is the best place.
30:18
The work that gets done there at the Andrews get done, because
30:20
it is the best place to do it.
30:20
There are
30:23
a lot of things that go into making something the best
30:24
place or not the best place.
30:29
Convenience and sight characteristics aren’t the only things.
30:34
The history of data for the site makes it the right place to do something
30:40
no matter how intricate they may be.
30:43
The fact the people available from whom you could get a history
30:49
of the place, find out what’s gone on at your particular site.
30:53
There are not that many places where you can do that.
30:58
So, there all kinds of reasons why it might not be the most
31:03
convenient place to do something and, yet, it’s the right choice.
31:09
That said, I don’t know if you’ve gotten this explained to you, but
31:17
certainly within the Conifer Forest Biome there was a strong competition,
31:23
if not jealously, between the two areas of major studies, Cedar Creek [site
31:28
in Cedar River watershed, Washington, stream site for U of W in IBP-Coniferous
31:31
Forest Biome] at the University of Washington, and the Andrews here.
31:34
I would say Andrews was associated with Oregon State University, but at
31:38
that time, Oregon State University wasn’t much on the Andrews.
31:45
At least, our college did [get involved there] , but that has changed
31:47
radically the last 10 or 15 years.
31:50
Now finally, I’m proud of it.
31:53
I should have been all along.
31:55
But at the time, it was PNW [Pacific Northwest Research Station] with
32:01
Jerry Franklin as the lead person, and Dick Waring as the site
32:07
director, who was OSU tenured faculty
32:15
and all that.
32:15
[OSU as
32:29
institution wasn’t much interested.] But the University of
32:36
Washington was really excited about IBP, and strongly
32:38
supported it as an institution.
32:43
Stan Gessel was the founding director.
32:45
He was a tenured professor at the University of Washington, and by far the
32:51
senior person in age, of the whole crew.
32:55
He was a pretty logical person to be the guy for leading the Coniferous
33:07
Forest Biome project] among the scientists in the Pacific Northwest.
33:10
Interestingly, he’s a forest soils person.
33:13
He is the product of a
33:19
guy by the name of Hans Jenny at the University of California at Berkeley,
33:24
who died recently, but Jenny is widely regarded as the one of the major
33:31
fathers of soil science in the world.
33:40
Stan was his student and he brought this forest soils interest to
33:45
the whole campus forest group.
33:49
Stan’s student Dale Cole was the site director [Cedar Creek] . Dick
33:53
Waring took over up there.
33:56
[Andrews Forest]
33:56
At Cedar Creek?
33:58
At Cedar Creek.
34:03
Yeah.
34:04
Very different philosophies.
34:05
There were differences in science, managerial philosophy,
34:14
everything you can imagine between the group down here, and the group up there.
34:22
At times it felt really good.
34:26
So,
34:33
my early impressions of what role
34:40
an experimental forest can play was
34:49
tempered,
34:51
taking into account that I was supposed to be
34:58
working for all three of these sites.
35:01
I was supposed to be working on the Andrews, modeling, I was
35:05
supposed to be working on the Cedar Creek, modeling, and then we had
35:07
another high-altitude site called
35:13
Findley Lake, that was a much prettier place, much prettier aesthetically,
35:16
certainly, than Cedar Creek.
35:18
It had a road cut out of glacial outwash and rather ugly and
35:23
boring sort of place
35:26
in a lot of ways.
35:29
Bigger than Andrews in high elevation, and surrounded by
35:32
rock and snow, just beautiful glacial lakes all over the place.
35:37
For somebody that’s been climbing all his life, I had my preference,
35:41
to spend a weekend, I go up to Findley, not to Andrews.
35:45
But I was supposed to be working for all three.
35:49
I was supposed to be trying to get them all producing, doing something
35:54
with their data that would be useful.
35:58
Lean towards models of predictive capability and I was had
36:04
responsibilities towards all three, which I was trying to balance somehow.
36:09
I
36:12
looked at this experimental forest as being a site.
36:15
Cedar Creek was a site, and they had different sorts of
36:19
institutional infrastructure and were organized in different ways.
36:24
Cedar Creek is the city of Seattle watershed
36:30
[municipal water supply] . Findley
36:34
Lake
36:39
was also on the watershed, and it was also on the Snoqualmie National Forest.
36:48
We had a freshwater program, too, for people living on Lake Washington.
36:56
I went out on crews that and that sort of thing.
37:03
The experimental forest system is a good thing and Andrews was a great
37:10
site, but it was one of several sites I was supposed to be working with.
37:14
So, you do a lot of traveling around?
37:17
Yeah.
37:18
Every possible way going from Seattle to Corvallis and back.
37:23
I’d climbed them all [mountains along routes] . The fastest
37:28
was driving the long way.
37:31
No, the fastest was driving from here to Portland, and then flying.
37:36
The next fastest was driving the whole way.
37:40
The next was hitchhiking, which I only did once, but it turned out to
37:46
be from the bus to the train, and that changed from a train to a bus.
37:56
You’re talking about the convenience of access.
37:58
From your perspective, was the Andrews a convenient site to work at or not?
38:12
What do you mean?
38:13
Moderately, we had some trailers in those days.
38:21
I’d spend a lot of nights down there, and didn’t think that’s where I’d be doing.
38:27
I’d pitch a tent someplace or sleep in the back of my truck,
38:31
or maybe stay in the trailers.
38:34
I still do that [camp] most of the time.
38:39
It was farther from the university than Cedar Creek was
38:45
from UW.
38:46
In terms of the traffic we went through, we went through more cars getting
38:52
to Cedar Creek than the Andrews; it was shorter in time and distance.
38:58
The
39:01
facilities were probably about the same.
39:06
For the time,
39:14
the facilities were good.
39:17
The work got done.
39:17
An incredible amount of field work got done
39:20
from 1969 or whenever that thing [EER-LTER] started, maybe it
39:22
[IBP] went from 1966 to 1976.
39:24
Do you have the dates?
39:25
It starts about ‘68-’69, and goes to.… [IBP era, HJA, 1967-76; Application
39:25
query-1967/68, first grant funded, 1970, program formally finished, 1976]
39:25
. …Maybe it was a five-year period.
39:26
It happened until ‘76 or ’75.
39:44
We got more field work done there in that 3-4 year period, than probably
39:51
has been done than some other sites.
39:55
The kind of money we had available to do the standard ecosystem work;
40:00
precipitation, solution chemistry, and cutting down trees to get
40:00
biomass, digging up root systems for biomass circulation through
40:16
forest roots.
40:17
We never had it since, and at this rate, we will never have
40:22
it again.
40:22
We’d never had that kind of money since.
40:25
Nobody’s had
40:29
that kind of money
40:33
since.
40:33
When you think of that period of activity, how do describe your level of interaction
40:43
Forest Service scientists and Oregon State University scientists?
40:52
You couldn’t tell who was who.
40:52
In some ways it was even more so that way then.
40:56
For the OSU people who were associated with the Andrews project, they didn’t
41:00
feel they had much of a home at OSU.
41:01
OSU was not exactly proud of us.
41:01
So, we identified with the
41:11
Station and I had my office here at the Station since 1974 or something like that.
41:15
One or two summers
41:21
I was over at FRL [Forest Research Lab, an OSU facility on Western Blvd] , but
41:22
the whole rest of that time the Forest Science Department was over here in
41:22
the 1980’s or something like that.
41:22
So, I’d been here 5
41:29
years before the rest of that program was [moved]
41:33
. How did you swing that out of your office?
41:38
Because the university wasn’t willing to give us office space, and PNW
41:43
was.
41:45
Do you have any insight why the University was so nonchalant about this?
41:48
At that
41:53
time the college,
41:56
the forest industry was
42:01
concerned about the environmental movement.
42:02
And felt that it could stop the environmental concerns by
42:03
burying its head in the sand and pretending that they didn’t exist.
42:03
We
42:20
were part of that.
42:22
They pretended that we didn’t exist.
42:23
Or it wasn’t until the 1980’s.
42:26
In part is was Carl Stoltenberg, our Dean, who took so much
42:35
of that attitude with him.
42:40
Which served its purpose at the time,
42:49
but rapidly becoming a liability and I think [people began to] realize that.
42:51
Realized that it was time for him step down and turn it over to somebody else.
42:53
And George [Brown] came in and he took a very different approach.
43:02
He just looked for one thing.
43:04
Partly he wanted to, he really was concerned about environmental
43:10
issues and about the university’s image about being pro-industrial.
43:16
He just wanted a more balanced image.
43:21
He
43:27
also took a hard look at the kind of money in ecosystems and stuff, which
43:33
didn’t get [industry money] . A whole bunch of us really rubbed his nose in
43:37
it a whole bunch of times, and just kept pointing out that, look when you
43:40
get congressional mandated program to a FIR program [Forestry Intensive
43:41
Research] , most of the rest of the
43:47
money is coming from this group.
44:01
And you might want to take some pride in it.
44:03
Maybe do some nice things for us to on the side.
44:05
If nothing else, it’s doing you a lot of good, take a look.
44:10
And they did.
44:15
They’re proud of it now.
44:16
I think the whole college is and university circle.
44:22
And it’s really changed.
44:23
So, I think now there’s more of a gap, more of a “we versus them.”
44:23
Now at the PNW, university then there was back at the seventies.
44:23
I don’t think it’s a problem, there is more
44:40
now then there was before.
44:41
I sure feel loyalty to my college and the department.
44:43
I certainly didn’t feel
44:51
it in the 1970’s.
44:52
70’s, and 80’s until about what you said in 1990’s?
44:54
When did George come in?
44:59
I talked to him.
45:00
I think about 1990?
45:01
I think it was before that.
45:06
About mid 80’s.
45:10
I’m curious about your perceptions, or whether you had any interactions
45:15
with forest managers at the Andrews site at that time?
45:20
I remember Steve.
45:25
He ran the forestry program.
45:34
Eubanks
45:35
Eubanks,
45:37
Yeah.
45:38
Then before John Cissel.
45:47
He just shot up here and said hello.
45:49
He certainly remembers me.
45:51
He
45:56
had a special report.
45:57
Yeah,
46:02
I was there
46:05
when Lynn Burditt showed up.
46:06
Certainly, got to know her fairly early in the game.
46:10
I actually had more contact probably in the 70’s with people at the
46:18
Siuslaw and the regional office than I did with people in the district.
46:22
I felt like I had a really good
46:28
working relationship with most of these people.
46:28
It’s something I really
46:32
enjoyed.
46:34
We fought a lot, but I thought we fought fair and
46:40
respectfully.
46:47
Very fond memories of some of the people out there
46:54
who have retired.
46:54
I did work much with people in the district.
46:57
I had this Snowbrush study project and that had the district out there.
47:02
Those people did a hell of a lot of work.
47:03
I was just swapping war stories with the fire people down in the
47:04
district a few weeks ago about that.
47:05
What were you doing on that project?
47:23
We were trying to kill everything
47:28
except snowbrush seeds so nothing else would come back.
47:30
We’d plant Doug-fir, snowbrush would out compete the Douglas-fir, and we’d
47:36
be able to study the competition.
47:41
It didn’t work.
47:42
This was the first time the Forest Service didn’t have a
47:46
serious regeneration problem.
47:48
We
47:50
did everything we could to encourage the snowbrush.
47:53
We got 20, 30, 40, thousand [sprouts] per hectare, germinating, but they never grew.
47:59
The Doug-fir just took off, totally.
48:04
Up until the last couple of years it was growing better than everything
48:07
in the district, and practically anywhere on the Willamette Forest.
48:11
Our objective here was to create a stand where the Doug-fir grew very poorly,
48:16
and the snowbrush grew very well.
48:19
Then we were going to control the amount of snowbrush, and actually
48:19
weed the snowbrush out of there, on
48:26
two- thirds of the forest.
48:30
No visible effect of the snowbrush.
48:33
The rest of it died or went into the mud.
48:36
Never got much bigger than this [demonstrating low height] , until the
48:37
Doug-fir was about eight feet tall.
48:39
At some
48:41
point, it did grow a little bit.
48:45
We had various theories into what went wrong.
48:49
Dave Perry had a student work on figuring out why snowbrush never got going or
48:55
fully-developed nodules [for nitrogen fixation] . All he managed to prove
48:59
after five years working on this, was that not a single one of the standard
49:03
reasons you would expect to see snowbrush not nodulate, was a factor at the site.
49:11
He added everything into the culture in a greenhouse, but one
49:14
could see something reasonable the snowbrush was lacking out there.
49:20
Nothing helped.
49:21
There’s still some nodulation though in the soil out there, so we still
49:28
don’t know what the problem is.
49:30
The other thing that happened at the same time, was that the elk herd took off.
49:34
I’m convinced the older ones had finally stopped, and the
49:36
elk grazed on the snowbrush.
49:37
This
49:42
was the first year they started coming around the Andrews again.
49:47
They grazed on the snowbrush, they prefer it to Doug-fir.
49:51
That’s my hypothesis, without any proof of this what so ever.
49:52
I still think
50:04
it’s right, and wish there was some way to follow-up on this.
50:10
I think the problem of overgrowth of snowbrush in the 70’s was the trigger
50:15
to a herbicide-use controversy.
50:18
That’s when I testified in Washington.
50:21
People were screaming and yelling at each other.
50:24
Was the elk population getting to the point where they couldn’t
50:25
keep the snowbrush under control the way it normally did?
50:25
Once the elk came back, snowbrush wasn’t so serious a problem.
50:25
We did one hell of a lot of work do
50:46
down
50:50
there,
50:59
also a lot of
51:21
tree-planting.
51:22
The district took the lead in all this,
51:27
getting it down, did a wonderful job.
51:31
People are still talking about us
51:35
down there.
51:37
Was there abnormal [collaboration] at the time?
51:37
One thing we do need to do a better job on [is the effects
51:37
of animals] . It is changing.
51:37
The elk herds are
51:39
taking off, the bear
52:06
are coming back after getting wiped out.
52:11
Their effects are all through the system, and it would be nice if we could get some
52:20
more work done on this.
52:23
Work on the streams, and the insects, a lot of work on birds
52:27
and bats, things like that.
52:30
Especially the young-growth stands out there.
52:33
To my knowledge, I think that there is much
52:40
more growth.
52:40
Your perception, has there had been increased hunting recently?
52:46
Something strange.
52:48
It was my impression that the elk herd really increased the year before, that
52:53
year, the year after we planted [the site]
52:58
. Do you remember any of the names of the people you worked on that region?
53:02
At the region or the district?
53:05
The district.
53:07
I don’t remember their names.
53:08
I just met one the other day.
53:11
Bill Jackson is one of the fire people down at the district
53:15
right now, and he’s on the burn.
53:16
He
53:20
was telling me who the burn bosses was, and I can’t remember [name]
53:23
. Somebody else came and talked to us.
53:26
His name I’ve forgotten now, he was one of the sub-bosses there, something like that.
53:34
There must have been quite a few people who were there for
53:41
that fire.
53:41
It was about fifteen years ago,
53:45
so I can’t remember it, but Bill would remember who was there that night.
53:49
It was a memorable night.
53:53
Wish I could I remember who I went walking with under the burning trees.
53:58
It was so hot that it set off the trees across the road.
54:01
I
54:05
went down there walking at five o’clock in the morning with the guy
54:09
in charge when it was still dark.
54:10
We
54:13
were just looking at huge branches falling out
54:16
of the trees.
54:20
Not next to us, twenty, thirty feet away.
54:25
Full moon, beautiful.
54:34
Do you think about the people that you work with out there on projects out of
54:41
the ordinary, in comparison to other
54:44
experimental forests?
54:45
Or would you characterize that?
54:48
I don’t have much to compare it with.
54:50
I worked at one other experimental forest.
54:54
It wasn’t any different from the kind of cooperation and integration we [HJA] had.
55:11
The level of integration
55:17
I really noticed here, was between PNW scientists and university scientists.
55:27
That was complete.
55:27
Really couldn’t tell who worked for the university and who worked for the station.
55:40
The district
55:44
[Blue River] was great.
55:45
I just took it for granted, and didn’t think of it very often.
55:48
It wasn’t a problem area for
55:54
you at least?
55:55
Yeah, things were never a problem.
55:56
These were in the days when there were a lot fewer rules and
55:58
regulations then there are now.
56:02
I was going to ask you that.
56:03
When you were down there to do these things, was there somebody
56:06
to check in so let them know where you were putting in plots, or
56:09
where you would work on that day?
56:12
Art [McKee] , even in those days, was trying to keep track of that stuff.
56:16
Al Levno,
56:20
and Dick Fredriksen, probably up until his last couple of years,
56:27
did as much as anyone in trying
56:32
some kind of semblance of order out there.
56:35
I
56:39
really
56:42
felt the biome people took the lead, certainly setting up the
56:46
data bank and documentation.
56:52
Who started that?
56:52
That’s a hell of a good question.
57:02
We had two data bank managers before Susan Stafford was hired by John
57:06
Gordon [chair of Forest Science Department] , Bob Riddell and Greg
57:14
Koerper, I think.
57:15
Dick Waring and Chuck [Grier] , and probably to some extent, Scott Overton,
57:27
and I’m sure Jerry, also [had roles in the organization] . I think a whole bunch
57:30
of people were keeping track of what we
57:36
were doing, where we were doing it, and who was doing what and when.
57:40
We didn’t want the data to just go into the file cabinets and never come out.
57:48
There was a very big effort as well, biome-wide, world-wide.
57:52
This was part of the IBP effort to collate data, organize data, and make
58:00
data accessible from over the world.
58:06
We were being told this by staff and the international steering committee on IBP.
58:11
Biome
58:14
directors discussed it in meetings, with people in other sites.
58:18
Dave Goodall, George Van Dyne, people like that, were really instrumental in this.
58:26
I’m
58:31
trying to think of some of the eastern [U.S.] people in this.
58:37
In any case,
58:39
the concept of a data bank
58:42
in trying to keep track of things, was a
58:46
fundamental part of the IBP project.
58:50
Where do we began?
58:52
The push for it didn’t come from the station.
58:55
That I remember.
58:57
No, wait a minute, that’s not true.
58:59
Because the hydrology data were being collected.
59:02
Dick was working hard, Fredriksen, not Waring, was working hard, on
59:08
the streamflow chemistry data.
59:11
All that was being organized and made useful to people.
59:21
That fit in nicely with the efforts of the biome to put together the data bank.
59:28
I wouldn’t say it was a hard priority for the PNW
59:34
or university [OSU] administrations.
59:35
This was definitely a Biome IBP project.
59:36
Out of that came
59:36
-- [Break in tape]
59:36
[Missing words/tape] -- Those are
59:39
two names that aren’t mentioned much anymore.
59:41
They
59:52
were
59:57
both important people making this all happen; Bob Rydell and Greg Luckini.
1:00:02
Bob Rydell?
1:00:05
R-Y-D-E-L-L.
1:00:09
He died about ten years ago in a very, very unfortunate accident.
1:00:14
Greg, I have no idea what happened to him.
1:00:16
No idea.
1:00:17
What
1:00:20
was his last name?
1:00:20
L-U-C-K-I-N-I, or something like
1:00:28
that.
1:00:28
I never heard those names before.
1:00:29
I’m not surprised.
1:00:31
Scott Overton was another big influence.
1:00:35
I think I’ve heard that name before.
1:00:36
He finally left because he and
1:00:42
Jerry couldn’t work together.
1:00:45
Basically, Jerry and Dick couldn’t, I mean Franklin and
1:00:48
Waring, couldn’t work together.
1:00:51
So, we post-docs carried on.
1:01:05
What occurred through that?
1:01:05
What were the personalities?
1:01:05
People who were creative, enthusiastic, aggressive,
1:01:15
and had different ideas on how things should be,
1:01:19
frequently, would want their own ideas to be used, not
1:01:28
the those of other persons.
1:01:29
You just can’t do both.
1:01:31
Can’t please both.
1:01:32
I was going to ask you little bit about that.
1:01:34
If you could characterize your involvement in the decision-making
1:01:36
process in the group.
1:01:36
I don’t know how much of that I really want to talk about
1:01:43
on
1:01:58
the record.
1:02:00
A lot of it is personality, and people can be blamed for personality and
1:02:08
make judgments about personalities.
1:02:10
It’s
1:02:12
pretty hard to explain my perception of what went on without making judgments
1:02:20
of personality, and my job is [scienced]
1:02:31
. I will say that, especially back then, I had a lot …..I don’t think I’m going
1:02:41
to say this on the record, either.
1:02:49
That’s fine.
1:02:51
So, in terms
1:02:56
people being encouraged to become involved in the process, it’s not
1:03:00
the result of your monthly meetings.
1:03:02
But, is there some kind of different equivalent at that time,
1:03:04
or did it function differently?
1:03:07
There were meetings, all kinds of things.
1:03:08
There were committees that did a lot of work; there was a logging committee, a
1:03:16
few transition committees, and a weekly
1:03:19
cycling committee.
1:03:21
These were to be across the biomes [categories/sites] . We were supposed
1:03:24
to integrate, and we put the river and the lake models into the Andrews.
1:03:30
Then, there were inter-biome committees, something like that.
1:03:33
I forget what we called them, but they did the same things across the various groups,
1:03:38
nation-wide and then, internationally.
1:03:41
We all participated all these things.
1:03:43
It was just wonderful, as they really gave us [room to run] . This
1:03:48
coincided with when phone costs, and plane fares, starting to come down.
1:03:53
It was the first time a lot of these people ever met each other, much less give
1:03:58
them a chance work together, regularly.
1:04:01
Particularly, some of the international collaborations, where people I saw
1:04:04
get together and work in the sixties, had been reading each other’s papers
1:04:09
for ten years, and never had met each other, from all over the world.
1:04:16
To meet somebody whose papers you’ve been reading since you were a graduate student,
1:04:21
since they were a graduate student,
1:04:25
face-to-face, never having done it before and never talking to
1:04:28
them on the telephone, just really
1:04:34
changes things.
1:04:34
There were a couple of meetings in the late sixties that really set
1:04:37
up the first time some of us met.
1:04:38
And there were ones who you would meet by chance, that might be of interest to you.
1:04:47
I think in the power structure, graduate students and post-docs had far
1:04:54
more of a role than they had ever had in any major project.
1:05:11
Out of that came an incredible family of people.
1:05:14
Some of them to this day, have nothing but nasty things to
1:05:17
say about IBP, but they’re fun.
1:05:21
They wouldn’t be where they
1:05:34
are if they didn’t have IBP.
1:05:35
Some of these people have calmed down, and some I haven’t seen in twenty years.
1:05:36
How are they concerned?
1:05:36
That they were just wasting money.
1:05:39
Everyone was sitting around and arguing.
1:05:41
Nobody was doing their work.
1:05:42
Everyone was being nasty.
1:05:49
Why
1:05:52
is your view that these people had a stronger role than other sites?
1:05:59
Why is that?
1:05:59
The morale for
1:06:07
the most part [was affected by] , the University of Washington
1:06:09
giving grants to OSU’s post-docs, which was part of the conflict.
1:06:18
There were numerous exceptions, but
1:06:23
managerial philosophy was central to the conflict.
1:06:25
We could go on and
1:06:34
on.
1:06:42
There was plenty of perceptions that there was money available on the scale of
1:06:48
everything.
1:06:52
The professors had the luxury of having
1:07:01
graduate students.
1:07:02
It started in other parts of the country before it did here.
1:07:07
The Coniferous Forest Biome was the last one to get started, the second to last
1:07:18
one.
1:07:18
By then, there was a bunch of graduate students who had done a Ph.D. with
1:07:24
funding from the other biomes.
1:07:27
Came out here, as did post-docs.
1:07:30
That’s fine with me.
1:07:52
I don’t think Fred made it.
1:07:53
He went here for his graduate school.
1:07:54
He was at U of O. I don’t see it associated with an Andrews’ situation.
1:07:55
I’ve talk to him.
1:07:55
I think you are right.
1:07:55
We had a couple efforts at the U of W. Perhaps I’m overstating it.
1:08:02
I think
1:08:10
there
1:08:12
were the only two who had IBP graduate students fellowships,
1:08:25
who came out here.
1:08:26
In any case, there was a lot of work that needed to get done.
1:08:30
There was money to do the work and a lot of work that needed to get done.
1:08:34
It was clear that the faculty, basically
1:08:38
Dick and Jerry here,
1:08:43
had this money.
1:08:45
They had work to get done.
1:08:47
They just didn’t want to give it to faculty members who would
1:08:51
use it to continue whatever they were doing all along.
1:08:56
The idea was to do this integrated project, and that meant you had
1:08:59
to do something different from what you had to do all along.
1:09:04
Well, graduate students are real easy to talk into something slightly different.
1:09:06
Post-docs were
1:09:10
into different [work and ideas] . Faculty members weren’t.
1:09:13
That’s where the conflict came from.
1:09:16
So, the model here was using post-docs to do the work.
1:09:20
The model up there [U of W] , was graduate students hired by two or three faculty
1:09:26
members integral to the project, and who
1:09:29
did the work.
1:09:31
In either case, the money was available, and because these people
1:09:35
were doing the work, they were the ones knowing what was going on.
1:09:40
They had a lot of say about the direction of things here.
1:09:44
Do you know why UW went with the grad-level work as opposed to post-docs?
1:09:53
Probably, ultimately, because UW was a university, and this
1:09:57
was a PNW [Station] stage.
1:10:00
In other words, it was the fact OSU was not that locally tied to the project.
1:10:08
You said there were some benefits to
1:10:13
that?
1:10:14
Yeah, sure.
1:10:15
Grad students are great.
1:10:18
They work hard, they get a lot done.
1:10:21
And they go on and do great, wonderful things.
1:10:24
I’m very appreciative, but you have to spend a lifetime taking courses.
1:10:28
And,
1:10:32
to an extent they feel [exploited] . We spend a lot of time doing
1:10:35
stuff other than taking courses.
1:10:36
Sometimes you have to pay them to take classes
1:10:42
for three years, before they can ever start working on a project.
1:10:46
And they went results in two years, but there’s no efficient
1:10:51
way to get them to do that.
1:10:53
And with graduate students, you have a little bit of an unknown factor,
1:10:59
your taking someone on who hasn’t proved themselves as much, taking
1:11:05
more of a chance with somebody.
1:11:08
Post-docs have made it through Ph.D. That proves something.
1:11:20
I don’t know what, but that proves something.
1:11:22
So,
1:11:25
fewer post-docs drop out and say, I can’t stand this, I’m going off
1:11:29
to farm tobacco or have a baby.
1:11:30
Then
1:11:34
you get graduate students who say I can’t deal with this.
1:11:39
I’ve just had it.
1:11:39
There’s much more pressure on graduate students then there is
1:11:46
on post-docs.
1:11:46
It’s a harder thing to do.
1:11:47
Get a Ph.D., and then do a post-doc afterwards.
1:11:52
I feel we got a lot more work out of the post-docs than
1:11:56
out of the graduate students.
1:11:58
There were some exceptions, three or four really exceptional grad students at UW.
1:12:03
All of them could have gone on to be heads of departments, things like that.
1:12:10
They were great.
1:12:12
We had some graduate students do a whole hell of a lot.
1:12:16
Some never wrote it up, some never finished, and some never did much
1:12:25
of anything.
1:12:25
We [HJA] didn’t have any post-docs that couldn’t produce, but we had
1:12:30
relatively few graduate students.
1:12:37
We had some graduate student failures, but
1:12:44
we
1:12:47
didn’t have very many graduate students.
1:12:48
You can’t have no graduate students.
1:12:49
You just can’t ignore the concept of graduate student education.
1:12:53
So, at some point you have to bite the bullet and say, “If the work
1:12:56
didn’t get done as quickly and professionally as you like, you
1:13:01
still must have money for graduate
1:13:06
students.
1:13:06
There’s pro’s and con’s, and there was a lot of hard feelings about that.
1:13:13
I was going to ask, when you joined the faculty,
1:13:19
how involved were the students?
1:13:20
I didn’t have to [advise grad students] because I was soft
1:13:23
money.
1:13:24
I just didn’t have to.
1:13:25
I was fortunate.
1:13:29
I had to get work now, not two years from now after they take classes.
1:13:35
I was lucky to get a grant that lasted two years.
1:13:37
Two years was just enough to get a PhD. Student were just reaching the point
1:13:41
where they could be doing some work.
1:13:44
I didn’t start getting graduate students at all until I got on
1:13:48
tenure track until the university started paying my salary here.
1:13:50
I couldn’t afford the luxury of graduate students.
1:13:54
It’s great.
1:13:55
You can’t be funding [grad students] with your own salary, very effectively.
1:14:03
I had a few.
1:14:07
From the perspective of the Cedar Creek and Andrews programs,
1:14:09
you talk about the student vs.
1:14:09
post-doc [issue] . What impact did that have on
1:14:12
the
1:14:18
integration of the degrees into the Biome projects?
1:14:22
There was always a [flap]
1:14:26
whenever anything went wrong.
1:14:29
Around here, that’s because there weren’t graduate students.
1:14:35
This place [HJA] said they were using students, and something went wrong here.
1:14:38
The place up there said they weren’t using
1:14:42
students.
1:14:42
Just gives people just one more excuse to bicker with each other.
1:14:49
There were all kinds of other excuses,
1:14:54
but that was one, strictly convenient.
1:14:56
I was thinking that with professor and graduate students, it might
1:15:04
have more continuity then having a string of post-docs who may or may not finish
1:15:11
your research?
1:15:12
Well, that’s true.
1:15:17
I say that now because I’ve been here 25
1:15:22
years.
1:15:23
At the time I didn’t want to identify with the leadership.
1:15:24
I wanted to stay a neutral course.
1:15:24
I had a lot of respect for people in those
1:15:34
times.
1:15:35
Still do.
1:15:37
Some of my best friends are at the University of Washington.
1:15:47
We may have worked harder on the data bank system here, very recently.
1:15:52
We felt more susceptible to people leaving and flunking out,
1:16:01
moving on, [becoming] dope heads.
1:16:04
That’s the continuity that tenured professors at U of W had to deal with.
1:16:13
More emphasis here on the documentation
1:16:18
and stuff?
1:16:18
My feeling was there was more emphasis on it here.
1:16:30
You mention that you didn’t often spend the night down at the Andrews.
1:16:35
I was curious about your level of involvement with other people
1:16:39
down at the Andrews site, and
1:16:46
how important was that kind of interaction to your research project?
1:16:48
Well, the people I worked most closely with were
1:16:54
Mike McCorison,
1:16:58
Fred Glenn, Dick
1:17:11
Fredriksen, and Bob Fogel.
1:17:12
Didn’t work with Fred [Swanson] . Didn’t work much with Jim Sedell.
1:17:19
Didn’t work much with Jerry.
1:17:23
I thinking I’m on the Waring side, instead of Franklin.
1:17:32
The person I
1:17:39
worked closely with
1:17:49
was Chuck Grier.
1:17:50
He came from UW, not OSU.
1:17:53
He was the most important person.
1:17:53
When I published the nutrient cycling data from Watershed 10, Chuck was
1:17:58
the second author, and also, Bob Fogel or Fredriksen [other authors]
1:18:05
. It might have been McCorison.
1:18:06
Fredriksen didn’t much
1:18:23
do much
1:18:27
in analyzing the data, but was very supportive.
1:18:33
Chuck was the one who really worked
1:18:37
on
1:18:40
the data.
1:18:41
Chuck was my focal point who worked on data for me.
1:18:46
Then, I got interested in the [plant/habitat groups?] refining a
1:18:53
classification system, about ’76 or ‘77.
1:18:57
I’m
1:19:12
curious of all these names.
1:19:13
These are people who were good collaborators originally,
1:19:20
from your interaction with them?
1:19:22
You’re on campus or
1:19:25
involved in field work somewhere?
1:19:31
We would go down there [Andrews Forest] to work on specific things.
1:19:35
Then we developed interactions on campus.
1:19:40
I only went down there when I needed to.
1:19:41
How commonly was that?
1:19:41
Every week or two, something like that.
1:19:48
The data were conveyed,
1:19:59
something like
1:20:04
that.
1:20:04
I had
1:20:06
three grants for field work at the Andrews, and the crews did research
1:20:14
for months and months and months.
1:20:16
Mostly, they took the lead on that and I didn’t have to be down there
1:20:22
as much.
1:20:23
Steve Cline and Tom Verhoeven [grad students] . Tom is somebody that might be
1:20:28
fun to interview, and Steve Cline, too.
1:20:33
Tom?
1:20:33
Did you ever hear of Peoria Gardens?
1:20:34
Not much about it?
1:20:35
Across the river.
1:20:35
Peoria Road.
1:20:36
He
1:20:49
used to work for me down at the Andrews.
1:20:52
Quit his job at OSU to found a national seedling distributorship.
1:20:59
Steve Cline worked down at the Andrews for 3 or 4 years back then.
1:21:04
After the biome [IBP] , after they took the watershed grant.
1:21:08
I don’t need to brief you about that.
1:21:12
He left and went to EPA in San Francisco.
1:21:13
Now he’s back at OSU.
1:21:13
I saw him interview the other day.
1:21:13
But he’s back in town.
1:21:13
Is he
1:21:16
in Corvallis?
1:21:18
I think
1:21:21
so.
1:21:21
He’s
1:21:25
around here somewhere.
1:21:25
You might try the phone book and
1:21:36
see.
1:21:36
C-O-E-E-N?
1:21:37
No, Cline.
1:21:39
There’s always been
1:21:43
social groups evolving around the Andrews.
1:21:46
And then, a number of people who did a lot of work down there
1:21:54
who aren’t necessarily part of these social groups, and who I think play
1:22:00
a real important role down there.
1:22:04
I’d like to see these people and their contributions remembered.
1:22:09
Have you talked to George Carroll at all?
1:22:13
No.
1:22:15
He’s at U of O. He runs the program down there, for 7 or 8 years.
1:22:22
George?
1:22:22
C-A-R-R-O-L-L.
1:22:26
Professor of biology at University of Oregon.
1:22:29
He worked with Bill Denison, who’s name
1:22:36
you might have heard.
1:22:39
Denison worked on the tree climbing
1:22:58
thing.
1:22:58
George was down there for many, many years,
1:23:06
and I think all these people made a substantial contribution.
1:23:08
That’s why I bring up people like Steve Cline and Tom Verhoeven.
1:23:21
What you are saying is that there were different groups that would
1:23:26
collect around certain personalities, individuals or different studies?
1:23:30
Didn’t necessarily work with those very much.
1:23:35
Not necessarily a lot of
1:23:40
interaction, but any formal, structured integration of that work later?
1:23:43
Any
1:23:48
interaction at conferences and efforts the Biome, that brought interaction
1:23:52
between Cedar Creek and the Andrews?
1:23:59
Well at the time of the biome, definitely.
1:24:02
Once the biome ended, the money for travel disappeared.
1:24:07
The requirement, the responsibility to NSF, that we collaborate, disappeared,
1:24:15
in terms of a huge sticker project with one PI and a pair well-defined
1:24:23
organizations with national and international connections, and
1:24:29
us post-docs writing proposals so we can stay here.
1:24:34
So, the
1:24:39
whole tone changed a great deal.
1:24:39
It became much more insular and fragmented.
1:24:46
By the time George got his NSF grant to the U of O, even Bill Denison
1:24:51
had dropped out of the scene.
1:24:53
I was working with George.
1:25:00
And no, we didn’t have meetings that crossed the line between George’s
1:25:07
group and what other people were doing.
1:25:12
I talked to a hydrologist here now and
1:25:17
they don’t know George’s work.
1:25:18
They never heard of him.
1:25:18
They didn’t know somebody built the model for tree fall dynamics on
1:25:24
Watershed 10, back in ‘78 or ‘79.
1:25:31
Some integration certainly managed to take place as well as it could have.
1:25:34
I think this
1:25:38
largely Fred’s doing, a combination of Fred and the fact that LTER came to be.
1:25:44
LTER came to be,
1:25:50
in part, to a reason well outside the Andrews and this group.
1:25:56
There
1:26:00
were national and international groups reaping fortunes
1:26:01
that brought LTER together.
1:26:04
Make it come to be.
1:26:08
Some of those forces were here.
1:26:11
Jerry certainly played a major role in both LTER nationally, and creating
1:26:19
a site here, perhaps the major role.
1:26:23
But, once it came to be, we had more
1:26:32
of a…….. Fred would remember this better than I do.
1:26:37
Trying to remember the month when it started.
1:26:40
I
1:26:45
forgot now.
1:26:48
Seems to me to be around the same time as LTER.
1:26:51
How it fast did that happen?
1:26:51
Or maybe they started it as a way of putting the LTER grant
1:26:51
together in the first place.
1:26:52
There were four to five years where there was not in the way of
1:26:55
organized maintenance, ‘76 or ‘77, once the watershed grant ended.
1:26:55
We got the equivalent of $700,000, the equivalent of about $2 million now.
1:26:56
We continued the
1:27:12
biome series in 1976, and the PI of that grant was Kermit
1:27:28
[Cromack] . Now it’s Stan and Fred, I guess.
1:27:42
Once that changed hands, things fragmented.
1:27:46
I dropped out of the group scene, totally.
1:27:49
I didn’t want to deal with it anymore.
1:27:51
That’s when I started getting other
1:27:55
grants.
1:27:56
I don’t remember how, by what mechanism or to what extent; Fred, Jim
1:28:04
[Sedell] , I think Stan [Gregory] was on the scene, Jerry was still here.
1:28:08
Dick Waring was well out of it.
1:28:10
Fredriksen had retired.
1:28:12
I
1:28:14
don’t recall what kind of mechanisms they had for meeting.
1:28:18
I think it was the ‘80’s before it started to happen here.
1:28:24
Talk to Fred about
1:28:27
this.
1:28:28
I’m curious.
1:28:30
This is the EER?
1:28:30
[Experimental
1:28:41
Ecological Reserve] Or
1:28:44
do you use that term?
1:28:45
Maybe that was for site funding.
1:28:48
From the
1:28:52
site-funding point-of-view is how we would have looked at it.
1:28:54
I would have seen it as a
1:28:58
combination of the “golden years” and “dark ages.”
1:29:05
Golden years, because there was more freedom?
1:29:09
Oh, no, money was easy.
1:29:12
Money was easy.
1:29:12
There were a lot of people.
1:29:14
Somebody pointed out the question I’m
1:29:35
not sure applies here or not, but you didn’t spend a lot of time down there?
1:29:38
I’m curious, for someone who drops down in like that, how important is
1:29:46
being at the Andrews for what people do for relaxation in the evenings?
1:29:50
You mentioned that it was alluring the first time you came out here,
1:29:53
but when you decided to do the job?
1:29:54
But, it wasn’t the social thing down there.
1:29:54
It was the social thing here that I didn’t find great.
1:29:54
No, I had interest in it down there.
1:29:54
It wasn’t something that allured me at all.
1:29:54
In fact, in a lot of ways it turned me off.
1:29:55
I don’t know, I was just silent.
1:29:56
I was used to serious outdoor people who seem to be
1:30:26
interested in sitting around camp fires and that kind of thing.
1:30:30
Chuck was my friend.
1:30:32
He and I spent a lot of time climbing together.
1:30:35
We climbed all over the Cascades.
1:30:40
We climbed over the Coast Range.
1:30:41
All over the Washington and Oregon Cascades.
1:30:48
We were serious
1:30:57
climbers,
1:31:01
downright serious climbers.
1:31:03
These people were afraid to stay out in the woods.
1:31:10
Places like Wolf Rock up there?
1:31:12
Shit rock.
1:31:13
Shitty rock.
1:31:15
Shitty rock.
1:31:16
We used to go over to Mount Washington and climb up the southwest ridge.
1:31:19
That
1:31:30
was nicest rock in the area.
1:31:32
Chuck and I found it very beautiful and the most elegant place around.
1:31:35
Just beautiful.
1:31:35
When did you start rock climbing?
1:31:37
Was that when you were out
1:31:50
here?
1:31:50
Since I born; 1962 or something like that.
1:31:52
Hearing about these hiking expeditions, several people went on there.
1:31:52
I think Jerry went out on some.
1:31:53
They’d
1:31:57
go out backpacking, and I
1:32:03
don’t know what they’d do.
1:32:05
We’d talked about before Chuck Grier, and you’d spent a lot of time with
1:32:10
him.
1:32:10
What were leisure time activities?
1:32:12
Yours were different?
1:32:18
That’s still true.
1:32:23
The focus for you, if I’m characterizing this right, and if I’m wrong, let me know.
1:32:29
The primary focus for you was you are at the university [OSU] and the people that
1:32:35
left you out?
1:32:37
It was the same thing at the UW back in the early ‘70’s.
1:32:45
I had two lives, two social lives; one up here and one down there.
1:32:49
Chuck stayed at both of them.
1:32:50
All my other climbing buddies were either up there or down here.
1:32:55
And the climbing, the serious climbing, was in Washington,
1:33:01
not in Oregon.
1:33:02
That’s my view.
1:33:06
You entered this building before the rest of the department by 4 or 5 years.
1:33:12
I’ve been talking to other people about the impact of that move on coordination.
1:33:19
I think they moved over here in 1980.
1:33:23
That’s sound right.
1:33:25
How would you characterize the impact of that on the relations here?
1:33:33
Start of the college’s inability to [ignore the Andrews] . You can see
1:33:38
it as the nail in the coffin of the college trying to ignore the Andrews.
1:33:47
That certainly became increasingly difficult.
1:33:50
It also became much further when Logan became part of it, because
1:33:53
he used to be sort of boss.
1:33:53
[Logan Norris was leader of the PNW Station project responsible for Andrews
1:33:54
Forest, but moved to be Chair of the Forest Science Department in OSU-COF]
1:33:55
. Then, Dick Fredriksen and all that.
1:33:55
I knew I was going to be his project leader.
1:33:55
Logan came to talk to me.
1:34:00
I was 26 or
1:34:10
something like that, and Logan was 30 something or 40, and a project leader.
1:34:16
We actually had a pretty good relationship, even though he was
1:34:20
Forest Service and I was OSU.
1:34:23
And we blew up at each other.
1:34:25
But we actually found a [way] where we’d started talking, and I
1:34:29
was in the line and got the job.
1:34:31
I don’t think John [Gordon] ever had offices with me.
1:34:35
John left [OSU to go to Yale] , and Bob Tarrant became PNW Director.
1:34:37
He became department head, for a dollar a year or whatever we’d pay him,
1:34:48
something
1:34:53
like that.
1:34:53
I think those things happened simultaneously.
1:34:54
That was serious training for
1:35:00
me.
1:35:14
I just wasn’t part of the department to play with soft money.
1:35:18
I really didn’t have anything to do with department politics,
1:35:21
governance as we call it.
1:35:23
I was fighting to make sure people told me what’s going on, so I could manage
1:35:28
my grant, managing three times as much money as most full-time faculty were.
1:35:35
There were times when nobody would tell me the rules had
1:35:38
changed, something like that.
1:35:40
All I cared about was being kept informed, I didn’t want to influence or anything.
1:35:45
And it certainly became easier to keep informed when your department
1:35:49
head was keeping something over you.
1:35:52
It had a big impact on people.
1:35:55
I was really not much a part of the department, anyway.
1:36:00
I was more a part of the station, and all these other people in
1:36:06
the Forest Science Department were somewhere over here with me.
1:36:11
It was nice to have the company, and was nice to not have to be running
1:36:13
back-and-forth to somewhere else.
1:36:17
It didn’t have much of an impact on me.
1:36:20
I’m not the right one to talk about
1:36:25
it.
1:36:25
Susan [Stafford] might have a right feel for it.
1:36:30
She’s pretty good about noticing people’s feelings and reactions, things like that.
1:36:37
Dave Perry would be really good to talk with, if you have a chance to catch him.
1:36:45
Susan Stafford?
1:36:46
Yeah.
1:36:47
She’d be a real good one I’m sure, because she’d moved at that time.
1:36:51
She’d probably had as much
1:36:56
hassle to her move as anyone, because she was running the data bank operation.
1:37:02
I would be curious to hear what she’d have to say about that.
1:37:08
I think it was a
1:37:11
long, distant move.
1:37:12
I think it cemented the relationship between the college [College
1:37:19
of Forestry] and the Andrews,
1:37:23
which was on real shaky grounds
1:37:29
through the seventies.
1:37:29
This was not that John Gordon didn’t support it, but he didn’t have the history
1:37:36
of being associated with us, as Logan did,
1:37:40
as George Brown did.
1:37:41
Are you aware that George worked his undergraduate on the Andrews?
1:37:45
Yeah, I talked to him once
1:38:06
about it.
1:38:07
I think it was ‘63.
1:38:10
So, even though
1:38:14
there was still, I think, a belief in a lot of people’s minds that the Andrews
1:38:19
group was a bunch of crazy ecologists, the idea that we were determined to
1:38:25
shut down the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest, is ridiculous.
1:38:30
May have been crazy, but we weren’t determined to shut
1:38:34
down the timber industry.
1:38:34
And we were crazy and still crazy.
1:38:37
That must explain everything.
1:38:43
People like Logan and George had a history of association with that thing.
1:38:51
Just made it easier for them to be a little more open and objective about
1:39:01
the whole thing.
1:39:02
And they had the tendency to see the cup as half full instead of half empty.
1:39:10
And a bunch of us really fought to for getting the college to adopt the Andrews.
1:39:14
And finally, it worked.
1:39:14
The college takes a great deal of pride in it and it shows.
1:39:14
I talked to George Brown little bit about this, on
1:39:24
Friday, about the whole
1:39:31
college program.
1:39:31
There’s a lot of money that could be used better.
1:39:31
I was wondering how the cultural awareness treaty that worked to better the Andrews?
1:39:32
A good way to deal
1:39:35
with that was to have them go and talk
1:39:58
with the scientists.
1:40:00
I was wondering if you ever ran into that.
1:40:05
What did you say?
1:40:06
That one way of the easing the donors’ concerns would be to go
1:40:10
talk to the scientists involved?
1:40:11
Did you ever experience anything like that?
1:40:15
We talked about this.
1:40:16
I’d given
1:40:19
a presentation to the FRL advisory group once [Forest Research Laboratory
1:40:24
advises OSU College of Forestry] , and got into a real pleasant conversation
1:40:31
with a couple of people, the other Norm Johnson, the VP at
1:40:35
Weyerhaeuser, and somebody from one of the timber families down here.
1:40:45
I wanted to continue to finish the conversation and I felt like
1:40:49
I had the opportunity to finish.
1:40:51
I’d think it worked.
1:40:53
But, I’d don’t think it’s happening.
1:40:55
I thought it would help.
1:41:01
Because someone is not interested, do
1:41:08
you think?
1:41:08
I don’t think George was pushed for this.
1:41:09
He may say he has, but I don’t feel
1:41:16
he has.
1:41:16
I think there are two real sources of conflict: one is, the college
1:41:23
gets money from industry [via a timber harvest tax] , and industry
1:41:25
is worried about environmentalists,
1:41:31
relating to being shut down.
1:41:37
Some of that has some basis, and some of it long-term I think would
1:41:42
be good for industry, and then, the long-term turned out good for industry.
1:41:46
They changed the plate somehow.
1:41:48
I think there are people in industry who recognize this, probably
1:41:52
people in industry who recognized this from the very beginning.
1:41:54
Not like they can speak up.
1:41:58
Some
1:42:02
environmental things were overblown and not good.
1:42:07
We can go through this sometime.
1:42:09
The college gets caught in the middle.
1:42:11
And you can argue about how effective a job that it’s done in steering
1:42:18
a middle course through this.
1:42:20
But, the fact remains, it had to try.
1:42:23
They argue about its success, but it’s been a real challenge.
1:42:27
And
1:42:30
there’s a second conflict that involves the university, or
1:42:37
more specifically, the college [Forestry] , which is very caught up in
1:42:44
it.
1:42:44
They control the research the faculty does, their lifestyle, to the extent the
1:42:51
money we as faculty use comes through FRL, and the legislature
1:42:58
and various industry-sponsored initiatives and funded initiatives.
1:43:05
The college feels it has a
1:43:11
right to tell us what to do.
1:43:15
Or at least,
1:43:19
not tell us what to do, but to be part of some partnership,
1:43:23
setting what to do together.
1:43:25
That’s probably being kind.
1:43:29
When we as faculty go out to get our own grant money, we don’t feel the college
1:43:35
has the right to tell us what we should be
1:43:39
doing.
1:43:40
College administrators have
1:43:43
a hard time explaining to the legislature what their scientists are doing,
1:43:52
when at worst they don’t know, and two, they don’t have any role in it.
1:43:55
They ought to feel like they
1:44:01
are a part of it.
1:44:01
When we go out and get grant money on our own, do our own things, and tell
1:44:05
them about it, when they ask us and don’t tell them about it, otherwise.
1:44:09
They’re not part of it and it’s not a very comfortable feeling.
1:44:13
Kind of makes them wonder what their role are as administrators.
1:44:18
It makes it hard for them to work with industry in Salem and that kind of thing.
1:44:25
Things are going a lot better, but there was a period of time there
1:44:31
when we were doing [things with] FRL money, and doing what the FRL and the
1:44:35
dean wanted you to do, or you were a soft-funded [person] and you were a
1:44:39
maverick who didn’t even talk to them
1:44:43
FRL structure.
1:44:45
Do you know what FRL means?
1:44:46
Forest Research Lab.
1:44:47
I’m not talking about the building.
1:44:49
I’m talking about the institution.
1:44:50
Okay.
1:44:51
We are the research farm of the state,
1:44:57
and the forestry research organization of the state.
1:45:00
The distinct group is the Forest Research Lab here, ODF [Oregon
1:45:06
Department of Forestry] manages the Oregon state forests,
1:45:11
and George was the head of the Forest Research Lab.
1:45:15
In this capacity, he reports to the legislature and not [OSU
1:45:19
leadership] . And the money comes from the legislature directly
1:45:25
to George, not through the university.
1:45:31
There’s a very
1:45:34
well-organized,
1:45:39
old established, power structure here.
1:45:44
Well-organized.
1:45:45
What I’m trying to say, not old,
1:45:48
established in a bad sense.
1:45:49
It’s got a long history of working that is the Forest Research Lab.
1:45:54
It’s not going to matter of if we close the building over
1:45:55
there on Western and 30th.
1:45:55
That’s what people think of physically being the Forest Research Lab.
1:45:56
But
1:46:05
in fact, a group of scientists within the college who are paid by state money,
1:46:13
not by the general fund, but by the state timber tax, money that comes straight
1:46:18
from the legislature to the college.
1:46:21
Now, the Peavy Forest is the other source of money that has to do with
1:46:27
the university.
1:46:30
All I’m saying is that after 15 or 20 years ago, people worked in that Forest
1:46:38
Research Lab structure, or they were soft money from their own grants, or
1:46:46
Dick, who was one of the few people who was hard money without grant
1:46:57
monies,
1:46:59
in the FRILL structure.
1:47:01
He has broken down some of these structures and gotten away from this
1:47:06
tribal anatomy in the last 15 years.
1:47:09
It is something Logan, I, and a bunch of others here, including Susan, have done
1:47:15
in the College of Forestry, and have
1:47:20
worked hard to accomplish.
1:47:22
We’ve got a
1:47:31
really good system.
1:47:34
It’s one of the best departments I know of in terms of people working together.
1:47:41
Yesterday, Bob Tarrant spoke about how well the Andrews
1:47:47
group had been working together.
1:47:51
For research ecology, yeah, it was.
1:47:57
If you look at the ESA, the Ecological Society of America, look
1:48:05
at the membership list and number of people in Corvallis,
1:48:08
physically in the United
1:48:11
States, and the world.
1:48:13
ESA is the home of the world’s ecologists,
1:48:19
somewhat the home of all American ecologists, and only to a
1:48:23
slightly lesser respect, Canadian
1:48:27
scientists.
1:48:29
There’s not just university, but EPA and PNW and USDA groups, and a
1:48:40
lot of people here who would call themselves forest ecologists, soil
1:48:45
scientists, hydrologists, entomologists or
1:48:48
something like that.
1:48:50
Even working at the Andrews – a lot of members of ESA.
1:48:53
There’s a lot more than are listed here.
1:48:55
Sounds to me like what your saying is during that period of the
1:48:55
‘80’s and ‘90’s there was a [large population of ecologists here]
1:48:55
. Well, towards the early ‘80’s and ‘90’s there was a change for
1:48:55
the better and it happened slowly through the late ‘80’s and the
1:49:00
early ‘90’s.
1:49:01
For a while there
1:49:04
was
1:49:21
a period when there was discouraging unto keeping of the ground?
1:49:23
Oh, I wouldn’t say that.
1:49:23
The money was there,
1:49:30
so why would you
1:49:35
need to.
1:49:40
I think they would delighted that people have done this.
1:49:47
Only if specific people became too independent.
1:49:50
How?
1:49:50
Well, the Forest Service has horrible growing pains with Jerry and they
1:49:59
couldn’t tell him what to do.
1:50:01
He had all this grant money and they didn’t have much control over him.
1:50:09
They didn’t like it.
1:50:11
So, all I’m saying is, when you talk to a dean or talk to a station director
1:50:16
or somebody like that, you’ve got to realize that they have a number of
1:50:21
jobs to do and have a very difficult line to walk between
1:50:33
giving people the support and
1:50:41
freedom to just do what they want.
1:50:43
Just making sure they’re doing something
1:50:51
and making sure what they’re doing isn’t embarrassing the organization or
1:50:58
making it difficult for you as a dean or as a station director to get by.
1:51:04
It’s a very difficult line to walk.
1:51:08
Some of our station directors have succeeded and some
1:51:11
of us have done better
1:51:17
jobs at this than others.
1:51:17
Getting onto about two hours here.
1:51:21
I can
1:51:23
probably come back.
1:51:24
We can talk some more sometime.
1:51:25
Yeah, it might be a good idea.
1:51:31
How are you going to know when your done?
1:51:34
I’ve got a time line here.
1:51:37
By December I’ve got to pretty much wrap these things up.
1:51:40
Oh, that’s good it gives you some time.
1:51:42
I’ve got about three months to finish up.
1:51:45
We’re about on schedule here.
1:51:47
I’d like to know more about your background, too, and
1:51:49
how you got involved in this.
1:51:52
Pretty candidly, if you can.
1:51:54
In return, I’d like to know a little more about you sometime.
1:51:58
I’ll be working up here, hopefully, my transcriptionists
1:52:05
will be using the office here for the next few months.
1:52:06
Well, hopefully, they won’t be playing the radio while they do it.
1:52:08
I’m not sure.
1:52:10
I’ve not met them yet.
