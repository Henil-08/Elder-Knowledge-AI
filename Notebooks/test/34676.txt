00:17
I wanted to give you a little feedback on the meeting since
00:21
you brought up a really good point that I have to think
00:25
of, instead of talking about.
00:26
The way you phrased it was pretty good.
00:33
It strikes me that you’re a little more concerned than I am about the
00:38
importance of striking a balance between academic freedom and guidance and
00:42
direction of project and at this stage.
00:44
I’m not really all that concerned about that kind of freedom.
00:47
I mean, the more input I get and the more direction at this point, the better.
00:51
The only concern I would have is when the final product is all up and written.
00:57
That’s the point where I would expect people to back off and let me do my thing.
01:02
By that time, if we’ve done our job right, we should be approaching the
01:06
same wavelength in terms of what we’re expecting out of the project.
01:08
From that point on, it won’t be affecting it anymore; it will be
01:13
the kinds of information I’m getting and the interpretation I put on it.
01:20
Okay.
01:22
I would encourage you, as much as you can, to get people involved in addressing
01:27
their revisions of who you spoke with.
01:28
Yeah.
01:29
That’s how some people approach research work.
01:33
Kind of their own area, and they don’t have any direction at all.
01:38
My field is actually publishing three stories which really
01:42
emphasizes the need to develop
01:45
group involvement in the early stages, and even during the writing stage.
01:49
Uh-huh.
01:50
[Affirmative]
01:50
For the final product, I’m concerned with my aptitude in relation to the
01:51
total, and how it can incorporate some of that and put it along
01:51
with some perspectival material.
01:57
One thing I’m asking for is you write a final letter, a
02:01
pre-final letter [Introducing history project to participants]
02:02
. Yeah.
02:02
So, when the final draft comes out, you can keep making
02:06
corrections up to the last point.
02:12
Yeah, right.
02:16
Finally, I’m the one who has the last word on it [Editorial content]
02:17
. Right, and we’re talking to a group that has to take in
02:27
closure and freedom, you know?
02:30
Right.
02:31
And so, that’s just why I want to make sure that I have these
02:35
issues out in front of the people.
02:40
I don’t foresee any problems.
02:42
Okay.
02:43
Yeah.
02:43
I appreciate that.
02:44
That was my next point, to have people be thinking along those same lines.
02:48
Yeah.
02:48
It really is an issue, but it’s not really something you need to be concerned about.
02:52
Right.
02:52
Just wanted to reassure you on that.
02:53
The other thing that struck me, I don’t know if you’ve seen it,
03:01
but there’s a survey of social scientists studying the birth of forest science
03:08
and the pile of the directories.
03:13
They’re sort of lengthy and they touch on some of the issues we’re talking about.
03:17
I’ll give you a brief introduction things that were part of the survey
03:20
that they did, and that I was involved in discussions with groups and things
03:26
like that.
03:27
One of the things that struck me, was your impression of
03:29
the nature of doing long-term research that you were going with.
03:34
You mentioned something about trying to raise the awareness of the Andrews’
03:39
people to this and related subjects.
03:41
That’s one concern we have as social scientists; trying to get involved at
03:48
an early stage in timing and policies, so that we don’t come in as late-comers.
03:57
I think what had been your involvement up to this point, and for a while, actually,
04:03
was as an editor and doing research.
04:06
That helped a lot on
04:09
this project.
04:09
But the desires were a little of the problem in terms of distance between
04:12
the researcher and the subject, and the more we can review stuff the better.
04:17
So, if you have any suggestions or things that I might be involved in,
04:24
we talked about the policy before.
04:24
Well, it came up at our lunch today.
04:27
We’re having a major public
04:33
discussion on the results of landscape studies, and that’s
04:38
the twenty-first of October.
04:41
It would be good if you could go and listen in.
04:49
We
04:52
are in
05:25
the early stages of planning a program.
05:29
It will be a situation where we describe some of the science results
05:35
from studies-to-date, and raise questions with managers and the public,
05:39
and maybe the media, about what the implications should be for management,
05:45
future managers, and from a science
05:53
standpoint.
05:54
Yeah, that would be interesting.
05:55
We would like to have you get involved.
05:58
And some things like the LTER meetings.
06:01
I’m not sure if I need to be all that involved – it might take
06:04
too much of my time and yours.
06:07
If something’s coming up, some issue that you think is important, let me know.
06:09
You can be
06:13
on the
06:15
meeting notes distribution list.
06:23
We send out information about other meetings or other
06:27
activities we’re working on.
06:28
You’ll probably want to look at and see if it’s a useful resource.
06:28
Those notes may go back ten years or so.
06:28
Yeah, that would be worthwhile.
06:28
Is that on e-mail, or notes?
06:31
No, a bunch of it was generated and stored electronically, but there are paper
06:35
copies.
06:35
That’s something I definitely want to look
06:58
through.
07:03
But anyway, something that I really liked that you said was about maniacal
07:09
persistence verses adaptability.
07:12
That phrase, “maniacal persistence;” I really liked that.
07:15
That “versus adaptability” in conducting long-term studies, that’s
07:20
something I want to pursue more.
07:25
One other thing you might mention to the people, because I
07:28
meant to raise this when Gordon
07:33
and some other people were there, concerns the question of the purpose of history.
07:37
The way I view history and the plan of history, is that it provides a kind of
07:43
institutional memory, where, as long as you’re around and Art [McKee] is around,
07:47
all the stuff [background] to the scene is going to be second nature to people.
07:47
They’re not going to have any question as
07:52
to how they got to where they are now.
07:55
But, if you left to go somewhere else, then retired, becoming less
07:59
accessible, like Jerry Franklin, he’s no longer immediately accessible.
08:06
A lot of that
08:08
leaves.
08:08
. . . [institutional memory and experience]
08:09
. Yeah.
08:09
And it helps ground decision-making.
08:14
Yeah.
08:17
But anyway, mainly I’m here to get some background from your perspective.
08:22
On your view of how things stood at the
08:28
Andrews at the time of your involvement up there, and your perception
08:29
of how things have changed over from the particular stages from
08:29
1972-1982 or 83 to the present.
08:29
You mentioned that you came to the Andrews in 1972, essentially clueless
08:29
about ecosystems and things like that.
08:29
I think you said that Ted Dyrness kind of brought you up to speed.
08:30
Would you elaborate on what brought you to Corvallis at that point?
08:30
Some
09:06
of the roots of the work I’m doing today in terms of interdisciplinary
09:11
ecosystems and geo/eco work, started back when I was a freshman at Penn
09:19
State and getting an opportunity to go to the Bermuda Biological Station.
09:26
As an undergrad, one year into undergrad, to hang out with a group of very
09:33
interesting, top-notch grad students who were taking a course on organism-sediment
09:38
relationships in an environment of modern carbonate deposition, which is where
09:45
limestones were starting to form today.
09:49
Okay.
09:49
There were sea-water chemists, biologists, geologists,
09:56
all there working together, including some really impressive people, like
10:00
Steven J. Gould, [went on to fame for his science and public storytelling
10:03
about evolution] . There were about a dozen grad students and a
10:08
number of faculty, and just little old me.
10:11
It
10:13
was very exciting to me to see interdisciplinary ecosystem research
10:18
going on and to take part in some of it.
10:22
So, that was a theme that I felt surfaced a few times in my history
10:29
leading up to my grad student days.
10:34
Then, I helped lead a project to the Galapagos that involved
10:43
plant-geology interactions and geologic history and things like that.
10:48
Was that at the U of O?
10:49
Right,
10:52
and when I graduated from there in 1972, then I
10:57
worked for a couple of other guys.
10:59
Alan Kayes [UO geology professor] , who’d actually worked with Ted
11:06
Dyrness and Jerry Franklin, earlier.
11:08
Alan had a small grant from the International Biological
11:12
Program [IBP] to do some work at the Andrews to map the geology.
11:16
I worked with UO grad student Mike James on the geology up there for IBP.
11:24
I was still living in Eugene at the time and was on IBP as a
11:29
post-doc, partially-funded student who had some other sources, too.
11:36
I was pretty marginal to the whole IBP thing, topically, and in
11:41
terms of time scales of interest.
11:42
In order to try to understand how to relate to the ecologists, I
11:43
produced a chart of what’s going on different time scales in the
11:50
geological and ecological realms from tens of millions of years to days.
11:59
I would have this problem of being disjunct in my interest from the
12:05
ecologists – the youngest rocks we were mapping were 3.5 million years.
12:09
Guys like Dick Waring were measuring dew-point at minute intervals.
12:13
So, I was trying to map things out in terms of time-scales to
12:16
find out what kinds of geological and ecological phenomena were
12:21
operating at similar time-scales.
12:23
When we were working on the same time-scale, the linkages
12:27
were likely to be most strong.
12:30
Anyway I
12:33
was living in Eugene, working on that, beginning to make
12:38
the acquaintances of some of
12:41
the ecologists, then I connected in with Ted and
12:46
a few other folks for the first few years there.
12:54
Connecting with Corvallis came in part through the interest of Jim
12:56
Sedell in linking the geomorphology with aquatic stuff; he’s always a
13:02
great one to try to link things.
13:06
I remember he had me come up and give seminars in a stream
13:10
ecology class, and then in some other ways encouraged linking up.
13:14
So, my wife and I moved up here to Corvallis in 1975 and then I really
13:20
started plugging in a lot better.
13:22
I
13:24
was a post-doc at U of O,
13:32
then, I became a post-doc up here and then I got hired by the Forest
13:37
Service in 1978, I think it was.
13:42
Uh-huh.
13:42
I was working with
13:46
[Forest Service Research Geologist] Doug Swanston.
13:48
We wrote some papers together in the mid 70’s.
13:51
He has a rather geotechnical orientation, pretty much
13:55
geology-orientated, whereas I was more working on the interface of ecology.
14:01
When he moved back to Alaska, from whence he’d come,
14:08
that opened up a slot that I was able to move into it.
14:13
You came in essentially with the thought of getting a permanent job?
14:16
Right.
14:17
Okay.
14:21
So then, my work moved from being geological to more geomorphology
14:28
as it linked to ecology.
14:30
From studying rocks to studying landslides and woody debris in streams
14:35
and things of this nature, that had more direct linkage to ecological matters.
14:42
What brought you to U of O instead of OSU in the first place?
14:45
Well, from being an undergrad at Penn State,
14:52
I was given the opportunity to go and work for the U.S. Geological Survey
14:56
after graduating from Penn State.
15:02
You could tell them what field you were interested in and what geographic
15:08
area you wanted to work in and they would do their best to match you up.
15:11
I was interested in oceanography-marine geology.
15:17
I wanted to be on the west coast, so I was given a job at Menlo
15:23
Park in California, where the main USGS office is on the west coast.
15:29
Our mission was looking for gold and platinum in beach sands
15:34
and placer deposits in rivers near the southern Oregon coast,
15:41
as well as the off shore environment.
15:43
Some U of O professors were studying the bedrock geology and gold in
15:50
the streams of the south coast.
15:53
Some OSU oceanography people were studying offshore, and then, the USGS
15:57
group I was working in was sampling along modern beaches and uplifted beaches.
16:02
Hmm.
16:06
I then got to know these U of O profs, I wanted a break from school, so I
16:16
stayed out a year and continued to work for USGS back in Menlo Park.
16:20
Then, I came back for a second field season, and then, went to the
16:24
U of O because I knew those guys.
16:27
At
16:30
that time I was interested in sedimentary geology and did a study in gravel movement
16:35
on the Elk River on the south coast.
16:38
Although I sort of tired of that area of geology,
16:46
it led to doing the Galapagos project because people were very
16:51
interested in sea-floor spreading at
16:54
the time, and I went from there.
16:59
You said earlier that you wanted to go to the west coast.
17:02
What was the reason for that?
17:03
You had been out here before?
17:04
I had been out here before.
17:06
I had come up to Montana to a geology summer field camp after my junior year.
17:12
My parents had brought the family out to the west coast,
17:18
and I had been interested in the west coast because I had
17:22
followed track closely, so I was reading about Oregon runners.
17:27
Also, my girlfriend at the time, she and some of her girlfriends wanted to
17:32
come out to the west coast to work.
17:35
They got jobs in San Francisco.
17:36
So, I’m just sorting out details; were you there at U of O when the
17:41
[Steve] Prefontaine was running?
17:42
Right.
17:43
Yeah, okay.
17:44
I really enjoyed watching that, he and Frank Shorter
17:50
and all of those guys compete.
17:54
So,
17:58
then I moved to Corvallis in
18:01
1975, three years into working into the group, and progressively got more
18:11
involved, although still somewhat peripheral to people like Art and Jerry.
18:17
Jerry was, of course, the main motivator, and I worked with Dick Waring.
18:24
Dick and Jerry made an interesting duo.
18:27
They’re quite different personalities and science interests and styles and so
18:34
forth.
18:38
I worked with stream folks quite a bit, Jim Sedell and I being contemporaries.
18:48
He helped provide an opportunity for me to get into River Continuum
18:54
project, which was one of the major stream themes for a while.
19:01
Then
19:10
I participated in LTER and enjoyed that early on and was a participant in
19:18
some of the forestry interaction work.
19:21
We had Dick Janda, who was a USGS geologist and worked on geomorphology in
19:30
forested areas, like I was starting to do.
19:31
He was on our Andrews advisory committee.
19:31
I was eager to have him on our advisory committee
19:35
to try to help stimulate
19:41
the earth science presence early in LTER.
19:45
Dick had a big influence on people like me and Gordon Grant.
19:50
He died a few years back, at age 54.
19:54
But, he was important to me, he gave up some input in LTER, and he was important
20:00
in our connections at Mount St. Helens.
20:04
I’ll be leading ahead a little bit into the early 80’s, the early
20:05
LTER era, which there are a few
20:09
things I want to cover.
20:10
Okay.
20:16
It occurred to me when you first started working for this group, you were kind
20:20
of peripheral to the group for a while.
20:23
Where you doing field work at that time that got you out on the Andrews?
20:24
Or were you mainly working
20:30
in other areas around here?
20:31
Well, I did a lot of work in the field and I really relished that
20:38
part of my experiences there.
20:42
I started out walking all through the Andrews trying to map the geology.
20:46
Hmm.
20:47
Then, I got interested in landslides.
20:49
Ted [Dryness] had written up the landslides from the 64’-65’ winter.
20:55
I would start finding other landslides, so I started documenting them, and that
21:01
led to a paper on the full history of
21:07
landslides since 1950.
21:10
We published on that in 1975.
21:10
Now, interestingly, we’re going back and redoing that with
21:14
a 1996 map, and comparing it
21:23
with the earlier findings.
21:23
I walked through forest to look for the rock outcrops and I walked throughout
21:26
the forest to for the landslides.
21:29
Then I got interested in the question of, “Hey, we’ve got all this forest
21:34
here in a “controlled” [native forest, not plantations] condition, like in our
21:37
controlled small watersheds, but nature bangs the system up, what about forest
21:41
fires as disturbance agents?” So, I asked Jerry and Ted what the fire history
21:46
had been.
21:46
Well, they
21:48
had counted a few rings on some stumps that they’d been sitting on
21:56
to eat lunch one day.
21:56
They figured there was a 120-year age class, a 450-year age class,
21:58
and a few other little things and that was pretty much it.
22:03
So, then I got interested in the frequency, severity and extent of fire.
22:08
Around 1975,
22:12
Peter Morrison and I tried to reconstruct the fire history.
22:18
Hmm.
22:18
We went around and counted tree rings on stumps, and walked the
22:22
forest looking for the fire history.
22:27
I spent a lot of time out there looking at the landscape from
22:30
different points-of- view.
22:32
It sounds like Ted kind of clued you into an interest into landslides and
22:36
things which drew you to that area.
22:42
I forget exactly how that happened, but I was aware of his work.
22:49
Uh-huh.
22:50
One thing happening for me in the mid 70’s was I was hanging out with
22:54
hydrologists, who were thinking about the hydrologic cycle and a
22:59
systems-approach to thinking about water.
23:01
Through IBP, I was meeting ecosystem and nutrient-cyclers who were thinking
23:04
about taking a systems-approach.
23:07
Where was the nitrogen stored, what processes moved it
23:13
from one place to another?
23:24
The small experimental watersheds had been set up, and they were they
23:32
were treated as black boxes in terms of what went in and what came out.
23:41
Water, dust and dissolved nutrients fell in, and sediment came out.
23:42
So, adopting the systems perspective from my ecology colleagues, I
23:49
tried to apply systems thinking to soil and sediment movement.
23:57
A few other people have gone the same way before, like Dick Janda.
24:01
We’re doing the same thing at the same time for somewhat different reasons.
24:05
That led to a small workshop that we held on sediment routing and
24:11
budgets and forest catchments.
24:13
So, that was
24:16
another area
24:21
of exploring concept development and then drawing on the associated
24:24
fieldwork collected data and
24:31
erosion rates by different processes.
24:32
Sounds like a lot of research questions and interesting
24:35
questions drew you out there.
24:36
I’m curious what were the connections between your first impressions of what
24:41
you saw and what you anticipated you were going to see once you got out there.
24:44
In other words, how did the Andrews strike you the first time you went to do work
24:52
out there?
24:52
I remember going out in the spring of 1972, I think it was.
24:57
I was about to graduate, I knew I was going to be doing work
25:01
there, and a few of us went out.
25:05
I remember not getting very far because it was still pretty snowy, and not
25:12
seeing very much because of all the
25:27
damp vegetation.
25:28
It has been an interesting learning experience for me, because I wasn’t really
25:34
trained to study the things I’m studying.
25:38
Uh-huh.
25:38
I think there is no place where you would have been trained to do this work.
25:43
And we’re still in training in some ways, now.
25:48
Yeah.
25:48
I
25:50
went out to map the rocks, and so little of the landscape has exposed rocks, a
25:56
percent or two along stream bottoms, road cuts, and a few other places.
25:58
So,
26:01
I
26:06
went out to do geology and couldn’t see any, so I gave
26:09
up and joined the ecologists.
26:15
Then, on the fire history work, I had taken a geologic mapping approach to that.
26:22
That
26:25
work
26:32
had a certain set of motivations, such as learning how fire regimes may
26:34
influence soil and sediment dynamics.
26:35
Now we’re going back and redoing fire history, expanding the area and applying
26:40
some different approaches, in part, because of the tying in with people
26:44
who are sampling-orientated rather than mapping and history- orientated.
26:49
As a geologist, I’m bringing in historical and spatial perspectives,
26:55
not an experimental perspective.
27:06
So,
27:09
what you’re saying, sounds like you were sidetracked into another area
27:12
you weren’t really anticipating when you started graduate school
27:15
or your post-doctorate work?
27:19
Yeah, or anywhere along the line, I didn’t anticipate the next development.
27:24
When you think back to that point in time
28:16
in your career, coming out of graduate school, you must of had a vision
28:19
about what you wanted to accomplish, or where you wanted to be in 20
28:26
years.
28:26
Can you recall what you had in mind?
28:29
Well, there were two things there; one was where I was at personally,
28:33
and two, was a more general issue you might want to explore in the
28:40
history effort.
28:43
Jim Sedell and I were talking a little about it the other day,
28:47
which has to do with letting loose some of your disciplinary
28:53
roots, which is sort of scary.
28:58
Just personally, I wasn’t real concerned about where I was going, I was just
29:04
sort of enjoying what I was doing.
29:07
I wasn’t married, I had been married, but I got divorced.
29:11
I felt pretty free.
29:13
I didn’t have kids to be responsible for.
29:24
I wasn’t strongly aligned to a particular discipline.
29:28
I mean, I was a geologist, but I’d been doing work in sediment transport
29:33
and I wasn’t very excited about sedimentary petrology and sedimentology.
29:40
I sort of lost my interest in it.
30:05
That’s where I went off to the Galapagos and did some paleomagnetism
30:10
work, something in the sea-floor spreading/plate tectonics realm.
30:13
Uh-huh.
30:16
I didn’t pursue other jobs very hard.
30:20
I interviewed a little bit a couple times, but I wasn’t
30:28
very aggressive and directed, professionally.
30:36
It was sort of puzzling to me at the time, and yet on the other
30:38
hand, I always sort of just
30:42
cruised along, let things evolve and just relied on trying to
30:49
have a good, positive energy, and figured that things would work out.
30:58
It’s interesting as a geologist, going out to an area where there are
31:01
very few rocks showing, where getting frustrated by the vegetation as you
31:05
go just a few yards this way or that.
31:07
In the Cascades region [“high Cascades” east of H.J. Andrews] , there’s
31:08
a lot of rocks, so why dig around there [HJA] , and keep working in an
31:11
area that was frustrating like that?
31:14
I was being facetious when I said I was frustrated by the vegetation.
31:19
I was quite interested.
31:22
When I tried to learn the species of plants out there, and I had taken some
31:32
ecology at the University of Oregon, there wasn’t much offering interest
31:36
to me [individual plants/traditional botany] . But, I was interested
31:42
in the linkages [ecological]
31:45
and how the system worked together, and that’s what helped me to stay.
31:49
And I liked the people I was working with.
31:57
In fact, maybe the absence of good rock outcrops accelerated my
31:58
engagement with the ecology community.
31:58
Yeah, sounds like you’re not that committed to geology or
32:01
you weren’t, is that what led to you keeping your options open?
32:05
I
32:07
was committed to it personally in terms of what was intellectually stimulating,
32:17
but I hadn’t charted a career path.
32:19
I hadn’t said, I’m going to be a professor, I’m going to do
32:22
my work as an assistant prof,
32:28
in five years I would like to write these papers.
32:31
I hadn’t charted a course.
32:35
I knew I didn’t want to work for an oil company in Texas, but that
32:37
was still an option at that time.
32:42
What did you think about the quality in terms of access?
32:43
I was talking to Roy Silen about the road systems and how those were
32:51
put in.
32:53
Obviously, you spent a lot of time there, you were getting access
32:55
to something you were after.
32:57
Did the infrastructure or the road system that was there, strike you at all?
33:00
What did you think about the facilities?
33:04
Well, at that time there weren’t any facilities as we know them
33:08
today, no buildings out there.
33:12
I camped out
33:15
or stayed in the trailers sometimes, which were off the forest.
33:21
The roads themselves, I appreciated
33:25
the amount of roads, just for getting around, looking at different
33:29
things, including the road-cuts, and of course the landslides.
33:32
I was interested in all the routes.
33:33
I drove a lot of the roads and
33:47
sure used them to get around.
33:51
You didn’t have any problems or any concerns about the way the place was,
34:00
the way the infrastructure had been laid down?
34:05
Well, I was interested in
34:12
forest management and roads in general, not actually the forest landscape
34:23
much, yet.
34:26
I think for the most part I was just taking it as a given, whereas
34:30
somebody like Roy wanted to know what’s good management and what’s
34:34
bad management, and he had direct input on how management progressed.
34:39
At that time, I expect I was feeling like quite the outsider, and I wasn’t
34:50
familiar with logging systems and road
34:56
systems.
34:56
Sounds like it didn’t make that much of an impression on you.
34:58
It essentially did what you wanted it to do and that was it.
35:03
It got you where you wanted to go and didn’t get in your way too much.
35:06
Yeah, that is my recollection.
35:10
If you think
35:13
back to the way you worked with Ted, Jerry, and people like that at that
35:18
time, would you consider them to be “avant-garde” in the work they were
35:24
doing, or was this something that just was of more interest to them?
35:28
Was there something that struck you as unusual?
35:38
Who out there would you consider to be most avant-garde in that
35:42
kind of work at that time?
35:50
Part of it was that we were moving in a direction that not
35:54
many people worked in before.
35:58
I just wasn’t familiar with the field.
36:04
I had audited one course in ecology,
36:13
but only a little bit of it.
36:15
So, I didn’t have a real sense of what was cutting-edge and what wasn’t.
36:20
What was being done, seemed to me like it was real reasonable to do.
36:25
It didn’t take great leaps of creativity to see what needed
36:35
to be done.
36:39
I do recollect that I had the feeling that
36:45
a critical thing we were contributing, was putting these pieces together.
36:53
People could go do a post- clear-cut succession study like
36:57
Ted [Dyrness] was doing, and probably other people were doing it.
37:02
I think he did a more thorough job than most,
37:08
but it was in an experimental watershed where you could link the
37:11
vegetation story with the nutrient cycling and soil erosion stories.
37:15
I recollect feeling that
37:22
some of the work was way out there, like the tree climbing [canopy
37:27
work] , and stuff like that.
37:28
It evolved in the later 70’s,
37:35
but a lot of it seemed pretty straight-forward to me.
37:39
The key
37:54
to me is to try and put it together, rather than seeing the individual pieces.
38:01
It kind
38:05
of strikes me that the people you’re talking about here, like Jerry Franklin,
38:08
who doesn’t come out often, it sounds like at that point of your career, he
38:13
wasn’t making that much of an impression on you, at least what you were involved
38:23
in then.
38:23
That’s an interesting comment.
38:28
For
38:32
some reason, I tended to connect pretty strongly with the stream people.
38:38
They had flowing water moving sediment, and I’m working on sediment.
38:41
I have landslides, and they’re worried about landslides.
38:43
I was involved a lot in the woody debris and streams theory,
38:43
but not woody debris on land.
38:43
So, I
38:59
think some of it was a matter of personality, and linking with Jim Sedell.
39:11
A lot of it has to do with the stream environment being
39:16
the one that’s most active.
39:18
I’ve
39:26
done quite a bit on fire history, but I’ve never had
39:35
the strength or linkage with the regular plant people in our group,
39:41
with all that fire history stuff.
39:43
I’m not sure why.
39:48
I haven’t really thought about this stuff quite this way before, but Jerry
39:55
is a tremendously important person, to me and my whole development.
40:05
Professionally, I consider him a really good friend and very important
40:11
influence on me, as I said today.
40:20
He helped us all.
40:21
He’d say we can stand up and talk to [Senator] Mark Hatfield about this stuff.
40:26
You know,
40:30
he’d just stand up and do it.
40:33
You look at the Andrews facility, say 10 years ago, and say this is what
40:37
you’re going to have at this site.
40:41
It’s sort of
40:44
like, have a dream, make it happen.
40:46
It can happen where that attitude is there, and although we may
40:54
be fairly common folk, we’re
41:05
good.
41:05
We’ve got good ideas, and we can make this thing happen.
41:09
I got nervous when we talked about moving the crane, Jerry’s canopy crane down here
41:16
when it was getting too [politically] hot for the Olympic Peninsula.
41:18
I
41:21
thought, wow!
41:22
It’s going to be like an “ecosystems scientist theme-park”
41:26
down there, with all these toys.
41:28
We had a debris flow flume [USGS project on HJA EF] and all that stuff.
41:30
I was concerned about too much luxury of infrastructure, and drawing
41:40
negative reactions because of it.
41:45
My general point there is
41:47
-- I’m sorry, back up just a minute; drawing negative reaction,
41:51
meaning public perception?
41:53
-- Public perception and other components of the science community that were struggling
41:59
to keep a $5,000-a-year study going.
42:04
You know, those guys are getting a $500,000 crane.
42:11
We could spend that money a lot better.
42:13
In a lot of cases, I would sort of have to agree.
42:16
On the other hand, if you don’t go out there and make some bold moves,
42:19
you may miss important discoveries.
42:20
It isn’t money that would of gone somewhere else in the science
42:24
arena, or it would of just gone to
42:28
parts of some aircraft carrier.
42:29
My
42:32
general point though, is that
42:37
Jerry has been a really powerful influence on me personally and on the whole group.
42:44
I’ve been reflecting on that a little bit recently when it was time to put in
42:48
nominations in the Forest Service category of scientists for awards, and just how
42:56
well-staffed we are with potentially high-level award winning scientists.
43:02
People who can receive the distinguished or superior science award for the
43:08
whole of Forest Service Research.
43:11
We’ve got two nominees in now and a number of folks that have gotten it before, and
43:19
I see a few more coming up in the ranks.
43:22
We’ve just been really blessed with good people, and it’s a bold move
43:28
on the science front that they’re willing to step up when it counts.
43:34
Jerry set the model.
43:36
And we had powerful linkages when we worked on things together.
43:40
Was he someone you were working with
43:49
on
43:55
fire history research?
44:10
I never really interacted with him that much in those capacities.
44:16
Once
44:20
the research-management linkage really started to bubble along,
44:26
then we went out a number of times.
44:29
Quite a few times, on field tours.
44:33
I always appreciated his commitment to the partnership.
44:38
I
44:40
really liked the guy.
44:42
How
45:46
would you describe your understanding on long-term research in 1972, in terms of
45:53
potential problems that were presented?
45:57
Were you personally the researcher and for the kind of science you envisioned?
46:05
I don’t recollect much emphasis at all on long-term research at that time.
46:13
Except that the watershed studies had been going, Watersheds 1, 2, 3, and
46:23
some new ones [WS 9-10, WS 6-8, all in HJA EF] were getting going.
46:25
In 1975, the treatment [clearcutting] of Watershed 10 occurred.
46:31
Also, some of the vegetation plots [reference stands] were being put
46:34
in, but I just don’t remember much discussion really focused on long-term.
46:42
I do recollect some feeling that the expectation of IBP was that
46:49
we already know a lot about these ecosystems, and we don’t really
46:54
have to collect a lot of new data.
46:56
We just need to develop our systems model along the lines of what Odum
47:01
and others have done for energy budgets and nutrient budgets.
47:06
We just need
47:12
to develop these big models and they would explain how ecosystems function.
47:19
There was a little bit of a feeling that maybe the business would be sorted out
47:31
in that context.
47:32
There’s an interesting question here of what is an ecosystem,
47:35
and what is an ecosystem study.
47:38
I think that some people who view ecosystem studies as sort
47:42
of nutrient-modeling studies and nutrient-cycling studies
47:47
and microcosms and watersheds.
47:52
To me, an ecosystem and an ecosystem study includes disturbances banging
47:57
all around, and all that kind of stuff.
48:00
I haven’t really tried to define it very
48:08
explicitly, and I don’t recollect much of a focus on long-term.
48:13
When IBP ran out [1970-76 at HJA] towards the end of the 1970’s, I know
48:19
Jerry in particular, from our group, was instrumental in working with others
48:27
and nationally to get a LTER-like thing set up.
48:36
The Andrews ultimately bridged its way into that through a temporary
48:43
Experimental Ecological Reserve [1977-79 at HJA, funding/admin.
48:46
bridge to LTER] . That is when long-term really became prominent in our thinking.
48:55
So, you were setting the stage for that, but it was not a
48:58
conscious effort at that time?
48:59
My take on it, and I most certainly was not in the mainstream, was that
49:03
Jerry was very much in the mainstream nationally, and people like Art were
49:07
more in the mainstream, locally.
49:09
IBP
49:12
had been successful in developing a cadre of scientists that could work together,
49:18
infrastructure around field sites,
49:24
databases in particular, as we have the Forest Science Data Bank
49:29
[FSDB] and some important commitment to long-term infrastructure.
49:37
What is the expression of the knowledge we have accumulated?
49:41
It’s
49:43
in publications and databases and things like that.
49:47
Anyway,
49:50
those developments were occurring in IBP, and NSF said this is a good thing,
49:55
and we just didn’t want to cut it off.
49:57
It’s really a tremendous investment, but its manifest in its infrastructure.
50:04
Places, publications, records, and databases; we try to
50:07
find a way to keep it going.
50:08
If
50:12
there was no conscious turn toward, at least in the beginning,
50:16
toward long-term studies, what was
50:22
being done?
50:25
What I’m really asking about, is how were projects and decisions
50:30
on study sites and projects made?
50:34
Who was making the decisions and on what basis?
50:39
Well, people like Jerry could give a much clearer answer.
50:46
I was more on the receiving end of decisions, and my subject
50:49
matter was somewhat marginal.
50:50
I took the early push to be to develop the systems models and the collect data
50:59
that was necessary to make them go.
51:03
In the erosion realm, the part I was working in, we were pressed to
51:09
develop an erosion model.
51:13
You say you were pressed.
51:13
Do you mean other researchers were looking for an answer to that, or just you?
51:20
People like Dick Waring were encouraging us to do that.
51:23
I guess money was being invested in doing that, including contracts
51:30
with some people at Utah State that involved hydrology modeling.
51:45
I think other IBP sites were probably more heavily invested in
51:50
the systems modeling than were we.
51:54
Jerry, for example, is someone with a much more intuitive approach and descriptive
52:04
approach to understanding ecosystems.
52:10
So, he had a strong influence on the how we conducted ourselves.
52:14
I’d say that we had a mix of ways in setting our course.
52:25
There was some direction that was universal across IBP, then
52:33
there were some local leadership influences, like Dick and Jerry.
52:40
Then there were also some opportunities for individual investigators to
52:45
perpetrate what they wanted to do.
52:48
You said earlier, and casually, that you were on the receiving end where it
52:54
implies you were making decisions based on a limited range of options or choices.
53:00
Is that accurate?
53:03
Other people, in other words, were making larger decisions and then, you
53:06
got some freedom within that framework.
53:08
Yeah, I think that’s a fair way to put it.
53:11
Okay, and that was largely driven by the availability of funding for work?
53:14
Yeah.
53:16
What kind of staffing were you working with?
53:17
Did you have students or support staff that were helping you
53:22
with your work at that point?
53:24
Well, I was a post-doc and there was a student, Mike James, who was
53:27
funded to do a particular soil study.
53:32
He and I worked together on a bunch of field-mapping [of HJA EF] . Then, by 1975,
53:45
I remember having some ability to influence work, such as fire history.
53:52
I got some summer students to work on fire history or on some
54:02
other topics, like woody debris in streams, which Jim
54:07
Sedell and I conspired on.
54:10
I had George Lienkaemper, who is now our GIS leader,
54:17
work on wood in streams.
54:19
So, by the mid 1970’s, I could gain access to small bits of funding.
54:33
Can you recollect the rough proportion of your funding went towards
54:37
staffing and what went towards
54:43
logistics and equipment?
54:47
It would
54:49
probably boggle my mind if I actually went back and really thought about
54:54
or looked at some of those numbers.
54:55
I remember doing a contract for USGS for $3500 dollars
55:15
for geomorphic mapping in the Elk and Sixes rivers country [southern Oregon
55:17
coast mountains] . I was a post-doc and I didn’t get paid full-time.
55:21
I was working with this one student for the most part, and
55:24
he has his own project as well.
55:28
We just had really limited resources.
55:31
I didn’t have expectations that were that much bigger, so I wasn’t feeling deprived.
55:40
You never felt pinched by the budget you had available?
55:44
I don’t recollect feeling that way.
55:47
I didn’t have bigger expectations.
55:50
The type of science staffing in the infrastructure we’re trying
55:55
to feed now, we didn’t have then.
56:03
Look at the computing scene we support and the field facilities we support.
56:11
It is mind boggling!
56:12
That’s something I haven’t actually included in some of these materials
56:17
and I probably should be talking about it more; the changes that
56:21
take place in computer technology and how that influences the work.
56:25
I think for a broader study in general.
56:28
The whole evolution of infrastructure
56:31
is a very important point.
56:33
It’s important in terms of what you can actually do out there, what is
56:38
directly supported by the infrastructure.
56:42
This level is the most direct level [for “x” funding/support to = “a”] . Another
56:47
important role of infrastructure, is that when you compete for large competitive
56:50
grants, like from the USDA and NSF, you have to define your infrastructure,
56:55
and if you have a good reputation for that infrastructure generating
56:59
quality information and making it really accessible, and you’ve got the
57:04
computing and the support like that, you’re going to be more competitive.
57:08
You have to have good science, but you have to have the where-with-all to do it.
57:11
So, that’s number two, and that’s a really important part of infrastructure.
57:16
A third thing that I think is quite important, but is sort of subliminal, is
57:25
I think people take you more seriously if they go to the Andrews
57:30
headquarters, it’s a bunch of nice looking buildings, it’s busy and you
57:36
go look at the debris flow flume.
57:37
The message is, “Hey, this is a serious undertaking. These
57:40
guys take this seriously.”
57:42
Yeah.
57:44
I know we got reactions from [Deputy Chief of Forest Service] Jerry Sesco,
57:46
when we had a bunch of junker trailers.
57:50
He said, “Why’d you guys let it get like this?” I said, “Hey, this is a big
57:56
improvement over what we had, and we’re not spending our research dollars on
58:02
facilities.”
58:05
Yeah, I was talking to him about that.
58:06
He said that he got really angry when they [Congressional members
58:07
and staff] asked him many questions.
58:08
Right.
58:10
Another thing is you go out and look at Mark Harmon’s log decomposition study,
58:16
and you say, hey this guy is really serious about this work [taking role of
58:20
dead wood in ecosystems seriously] . This is a major investment, the scientific
58:23
community is serious about it.
58:31
This work has passed through peer-reviewed proposals to be
58:31
undertaken as a 200-year study.
58:35
I think a lot of it comes down to the subconscious level of, “Hey, these guys
58:40
aren’t just out here spinning yarns.
58:43
They’re taking this seriously.” Also,
58:47
you have a big research machine to feed, an infrastructure system to feed.
58:55
I’ve had periods of high level frustration within the station
59:00
[PNW] , when it gets reorganized and there’s talk about being responsive
59:04
to client needs and stuff like that.
59:09
In the narrow sense, you could say that we have to support this infrastructure, and
59:15
the station reorganizes that in some ways.
59:19
When we reorganized, I was very concerned we were going to lose the
59:23
commitment to the infrastructure.
59:29
We’ve survived so far, but it’s sort of a constant battle and there
59:32
is a constant erosion of support.
59:34
Not due to conscious decisions, but just because the leadership up there
59:40
is thinking about this other stuff and forgetting about the things over here.
59:47
Then there’s also that aspect of maniacally sticking to
59:54
it, and yet being agile.
1:00:15
Can you identify some turning point or “critical mass” you have to
1:00:21
approach before you can do that. You build up the trailers out there,
1:00:25
and you had people working out of tents. Then, all of a sudden, boom,
1:00:29
you’ve got money coming down a chute.
1:00:34
Obviously, a lot of that was because of the influence of
1:00:36
what had been done out there.
1:00:38
Did you see, from the seventies to the nineties, a kind of curve where
1:00:44
you reached the point of a sudden take-off and new expectations?
1:00:50
There was an abrupt change,
1:00:55
and it would be easy to pose some very interesting interpretations.
1:00:59
I haven’t thought it,
1:01:03
but you know we built up with the junker trailers.
1:01:10
Meanwhile, our science was building up and the issues we’d been working
1:01:14
on for a long time, different people, spotted owls, watershed, old
1:01:20
growth; they became more prominent.
1:01:23
More people were coming to the Andrews to go see the product of the
1:01:28
science, to stop and take a leak in
1:01:34
our crummy facilities.
1:01:36
I know some of our station directors, and
1:01:43
this was a flagship place
1:01:53
for the station and the Forest Service.
1:01:55
I’ve never met a Congressional person, a staffer or Congress person in the
1:02:02
FSL [Forestry Sciences Lab-Corvallis].
1:02:04
We’ve had dozens to the Andrews.
1:02:08
Forest Service Research, what is it?
1:02:11
You go people in Congress, there have been a bunch of them that
1:02:16
have started thinking, well, of places like that Andrews.
1:02:22
I think there might have been some motivations like that.
1:02:24
A triggering event, the precursor, was the “ghetto on the meadow” joke coined
1:02:31
by a National Park Service ecologist in reference to the Andrews headquarters
1:02:33
site [decrepit trailers-lodging and research] . We had a field trip with
1:02:37
Congressman Les Aucoin [D-OR] , when he was on the House Appropriations committee,
1:02:41
and Mike Salsgiver, when he was lead staffer for Senator Hatfield, who was
1:02:46
on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
1:02:46
We had those two guys out together, we were not talking about facilities,
1:02:50
we were not making a pitch.
1:02:53
We were talking about changes in forestry practices and policy.
1:02:55
They went to work getting us an earmark for facilities improvement
1:02:56
so the place could look worthy of the valuable science emerging from it.
1:02:56
Aucoin used the quip [ghetto in the meadow] in budget hearings.
1:02:56
So, that “ghetto on the meadow” quip triggered getting the
1:02:56
money that’s built the place up.
1:02:58
A part of the ghetto story was when the bathtub fell through the floor in
1:03:27
the owl
1:03:31
crew trailer, because the floor had rotted out.
1:03:39
That was a pivotal event, as after, the station director said, “Here’s fifty
1:03:41
grand, let’s get this place going.” That was a key piece to get going on the
1:03:49
first bunkhouse. In a way, you could say that owls have had a pivotal that role
1:03:49
in Andrews’ infrastructure development, not just regionally in terms of the
1:03:49
policy changes that have occurred.
1:03:49
For issues that affected policy, old growth and natural ecosystems were
1:03:49
important, but the owl was the hook.
1:03:49
Now, these things are
1:03:55
all pretty recent.
1:03:55
This was in the late eighties, early nineties.
1:03:58
Yeah, right.
1:04:02
By that time, the science was built up and the Andrews had built up its reputation.
1:04:08
What’s shocking people is that this place that has turned out such high-quality
1:04:12
work living in these junky trailers.
1:04:17
I guess the question is, at what point does the infrastructure become a burden?
1:04:24
Were there some advantages to not having all that material?
1:04:28
Oh, sure there were.
1:04:29
It is
1:04:32
a constant challenge now, and the institutional commitment to
1:04:43
it, in my mind, is still vague.
1:04:48
Is this a research team [our little team] responsibility?
1:04:55
Is it a program responsibility within the station?
1:05:00
Is it a station facility, such that a lot of it should be funded at the director’s
1:05:04
office level, skimming off the top?
1:05:06
At what level do we support it?
1:05:10
That’s just in the PNW or the university [OSU] realm.
1:05:16
Is it a sub-departmental entity?
1:05:19
Is it a departmental entity?
1:05:20
Is it a college entity?
1:05:23
We’ve got a lot of different colleges within OSU that are involved.
1:05:26
Is it a university entity?
1:05:27
In the National Forest [Service] , is it a district thing, or is it a
1:05:30
Willamette National Forest thing?
1:05:33
But, a lot of the implications of Andrews’ science go way beyond the Willamette, so,
1:05:37
is it a regional office responsibility?
1:05:39
You get the buck passing up and down the line in each of these institutions.
1:05:46
So, it’s a constant scramble, and sometimes you come out fat.
1:05:51
Like on this
1:05:54
1996 flood work, we didn’t come out fat, we’ve been busting our asses,
1:05:59
but we got a bunch of money to try and rebuild our stream gauging facilities.
1:06:11
Other people cry the blues because they would have used it other ways.
1:06:24
That’s a funny thing about this whole deal.
1:06:29
It is easy for me to get overwhelmed by the challenges, problems, frustrations,
1:06:36
and personal issues down here.
1:06:41
You weren’t there when we had to deal with Watershed 3, and you
1:06:46
can’t reconfigure it because of this landslide and this sediment wedge.
1:06:50
It was screwing up our gauging.
1:06:53
I think I came in on the end of that.
1:06:54
Yeah, you just deal with these little things, one after another.
1:07:00
That’s why, people like me, I can get off on this history, because
1:07:04
that backs me off the scene.
1:07:07
Wow, we’ve really done some deep thinking.
1:07:09
So, the facilities are both a triumph and a sorrow.
1:07:17
Art was getting signals there was concern now that this Forest Service
1:07:17
facility is being managed by the state [OSU] . It struck me that
1:07:49
the more impressive the facility becomes, the more attentive
1:07:52
the bureaucracy gets about
1:07:56
status, prestige, and who’s in control.
1:08:00
You get a sense that back into the 1970’s, people were not
1:08:07
that tuned in and aware of the Andrew’s being there.
1:08:10
I think there was.
1:08:13
I think that was true, especially on the PNW and the university
1:08:21
fronts.
1:08:23
I heard that the PNW leadership would say,
1:08:30
“I don’t think I want to know the details of what you’re doing, because
1:08:34
it’s probably not legal.” Then we were the [OSU] College of Forestry,
1:08:41
which was heavily into production forestry on nonfederal lands.
1:08:48
You know, it was set up to serve private forestry and state interests.
1:08:58
Makes sense.
1:09:02
We weren’t real central in these different institutions.
1:09:09
I think we’ve become much more so for a variety of reasons.
1:09:14
Accomplishments and just the profile are up, and also, we’ve tried to be
1:09:23
good citizens of our home institutions, and not be the odd duck.
1:09:29
Things
1:09:31
have changed in ways that have gotten us more central
1:09:37
to forestry issues of the day.
1:09:41
The interpretation that Art has is one that could be made, that is, that
1:09:47
the Forest Service sees this as a good thing and will want to take more credit.
1:09:53
I’m
1:09:55
not sure if he was exactly saying that, but he was speaking more in terms
1:10:00
the problem right now, where somebody in the Forest Service has issues.
1:10:06
He’s
1:10:09
concerned that he’s in charge, but not a Forest Service employee, and
1:10:14
there’s a control issue involved.
1:10:17
There are some issues that are emerging.
1:10:25
We do have a problem where the business end of the deal is wagging
1:10:33
the dog in a number of respects.
1:10:42
It mainly comes from some people who,
1:10:50
for justifiable reasons which are not at all convenient or
1:10:54
attractive or of interest for us.
1:10:56
For bureaucratic reasons, they are trying to get the Forest Service house
1:11:04
in order, so if we’re doing something, such as having the university collect
1:11:12
fees for using the Andrews, that’s done in a way that meets federal regulations,
1:11:18
because it’s federal property.
1:11:19
Lynn [Burditt]
1:11:21
and I were talking about at it lunch today.
1:11:26
We think things are working fine.
1:11:29
Our view of the world is different from the business people,
1:11:34
but they are trying to follow the rules and are motivated by
1:11:40
the hope that we might think
1:11:45
along those lines.
1:11:46
So, we’re working through some administrative changes.
1:11:51
It is impossible to get the national forest system business
1:11:58
managers to understand that information is our product.
1:12:05
They look at dollars and cents accounting for running the facilities;
1:12:08
who’s staying there, they consider it like running a hotel or a campground.
1:12:13
I’m thinking, hey, I just spent PNW money to engage a university scientist,
1:12:19
who’s going to go out and get a grant and bring in grad students,
1:12:21
and do interesting work that’s in the interest of the Forest Service.
1:12:25
Look at all they are contributing, so we should be able to give
1:12:28
them a little room for free.
1:12:31
I like that information is a product.
1:12:34
What struck me really when I was speaking to Art was this is something new.
1:12:39
Which is more important for the history project I suppose since we
1:12:43
are going through 1998, that’s when the project officially concludes.
1:12:47
This is something you could probably keep an eye on.
1:12:52
What strikes me is that it didn’t seem to be an issue until recently.
1:12:56
Is
1:13:04
it unusual
1:13:08
for a major experiment forest to be operated, essentially,
1:13:16
administered by someone who is part of university not associated
1:13:21
directly with the Forest Service?
1:13:23
Well,
1:13:25
I think it is, but I don’t think that’s really what’s happening.
1:13:28
In
1:13:34
our NSF correspondence and elsewhere, he and I are called co-directors.
1:13:41
A lot
1:13:46
of the management of the Andrews is conducted by people like Al
1:13:50
Levno and people who report to him.
1:13:53
He
1:13:55
reports to me, and on the Forest Service side, I’m called a scientist-in-charge,
1:14:06
and NSF wanted a university person to have substantial responsibility for
1:14:12
management of the property, because NSF was pumping all this money into it.
1:14:17
The National Science Foundation, especially back when the issue
1:14:23
arose 15 or however many years ago,
1:14:28
they didn’t want to actually or be perceived as supporting
1:14:35
research by another federal agency.
1:14:38
They were there to support academic research, for the most part.
1:14:42
So, Art isn’t a soloist for leadership of the place.
1:14:48
There other leaders such as myself.
1:14:52
I supervise a lot of budgetary decisions related to management
1:14:58
of the infrastructure.
1:15:03
Also, there is distributed leadership within the group.
1:15:19
I’m
1:15:55
not directly going with this, but I do find it interesting and it really
1:16:01
came out of my discussion with Art when I was down at the Andrews.
1:16:04
There’s an interesting situation, I’m not sure if I can find it here, which directs
1:16:10
me to something unique about the Andrews.
1:16:13
Check and see if I made it too strongly in here.
1:16:18
I recognize the joint administration, and it strikes me that now it’s an issue.
1:16:27
There’s something about that arrangement that’s unique and has worked.
1:16:58
I think
1:17:07
that is important.
1:17:08
I want to be careful to not get tangled up with issues that are very proximal issues.
1:17:17
Art has
1:17:21
a different view of what’s going on than I do, and a different
1:17:24
view of how to deal with it.
1:17:27
I do think
1:17:30
that if you go anywhere – I think you may have found it in Alaska – there is
1:17:35
a constant kind of bickering between the science cadre and the leadership.
1:17:46
You probably find this kind of thing in any bureaucracy in some senses, and
1:17:54
then, in science doing bureaucracy, you probably find the same kinds of things.
1:18:01
In fact, there are cartoons on the wall of our office about higher levels
1:18:04
of the organization being well-funded while the lower levels where the
1:18:04
science takes place, coming up short.
1:18:05
There’s one where there’s three people sitting around a table, one of them has
1:18:09
a huge plate of food, another one has a smaller one, and another one has a bone.
1:18:19
You have administration and science, you know the science is the bone,
1:18:24
and administration is the big plate.
1:18:32
That’s a real good insight, and it’s not something that’s unique here.
1:18:37
What is interesting in some settings, is that this kind of
1:18:40
bickering becomes debilitating.
1:18:42
I don’t see sight of that
1:18:49
at the Andrews.
1:18:50
I’ve heard philosophizers calling those kind of rumors back,
1:18:54
but it seems at the Andrews it didn’t have that kind of impact.
1:18:56
That’s what I’m trying to get at here.
1:18:57
In the 1970’s and 1980’s, you had this period of
1:19:04
an emerging move toward long-term, integrated studies, with a number
1:19:11
of people getting involved.
1:19:12
In 1972, when you came on, and 1983
1:19:26
or
1:19:36
thereabouts, when the transformation was taking place [to LTER] , what
1:19:45
would you identify as the most remarkable successes, and some of the
1:19:51
problems the people of the Andrews were uncovering at that stage?
1:19:56
From 1972 to 1983?
1:20:05
You mentioned one already, which was the NSF funding and the concern about
1:20:09
granting funds to another federal agency, as opposed to a university.
1:20:11
With
1:20:23
the inception of LTER, which is the local scene of the 1980’s, I think
1:20:36
we really made the transition from the early IBP days, when I did
1:20:42
not perceive long-term research as our major focus, to the early
1:20:47
LTER days, when it was the focus.
1:20:52
In 1983, some of our infrastructure was substantially improved as we
1:20:59
continued to develop information management and data management systems,
1:21:06
and development of the Andrews field facility on-site was beginning.
1:21:14
The early parts of LTER focused around a series of long-term experiments, and
1:21:19
we were beginning to implement those.
1:21:25
I think we were trying to communicate with land managers and having some
1:21:33
summer short courses at that time.
1:21:36
We were also in the early Mount St. Helens period.
1:21:43
Mount St. Helens blew up
1:21:47
May 18, 1980, and that had taken some energy off the Andrews
1:21:52
just as LTER was beginning.
1:21:56
The alliances we had built through IBP and the Andrews,
1:22:02
were really critical in going after the Mount St. Helen’s opportunity.
1:22:09
We had an aquatics group; lakes, thermal environments, and streams, with
1:22:14
Jim Sedell as the point person, Jerry leading on terrestrial vegetation, and
1:22:19
overall, I was a contact on the geo front and erosion and linking with USGS.
1:22:27
We learned a bunch of things in the gray forests there that we brought
1:22:29
back to the green forests and Andrews.
1:22:33
So, those were some of the things that developed over that time period.
1:22:37
That’s interesting, as that was brought up in workshops with Art.
1:22:41
One of
1:22:43
the key things about the Andrews is that it became a kind of go-to place,
1:22:48
where there was a cadre of people working together already on projects.
1:22:54
So, when something came up that was of public interest,
1:22:58
it attracted attention.
1:22:59
Some of what you’re saying is that Mount St. Helens was a natural event that
1:23:04
sparked the consciousness of this group.
1:23:09
Some of us
1:23:14
gravitated to it strongly.
1:23:17
I sure as hell did, and capitalized on my U.S. Geological Survey
1:23:21
contacts to get to go in there early.
1:23:25
Then,
1:23:28
as I recollect, it was our initiative, and Jerry got fifty grand from NSF to
1:23:34
help provide access for other scientists.
1:23:39
Access was a big problem.
1:23:41
The Forest Service was presenting a lot of obstacles with the concern for safety.
1:23:48
Costs for getting in were high because you needed a helicopter or
1:23:55
four-wheel drive in a lot of areas.
1:23:57
For access, you needed permits, radios on USFS frequencies, and all kinds of stuff.
1:23:57
So, in a way
1:24:04
the Andrews was a go-to place even there, although people didn’t come and tell us
1:24:10
to go do stuff, as much as we would go out to do it out of our own interest.
1:24:20
It was also a go-out-from place,
1:24:25
as some people accused us of hunkering there and putting too
1:24:27
many eggs in one basket [reference to big research investment at the
1:24:29
Andrews] . Yet, we’ve gone out of that geography in many different ways;
1:24:38
through pulse studies, through extensive vegetation plot work across
1:24:44
the region, on a consulting basis, and through the LTER network, nationally.
1:24:48
We go out and test our ideas elsewhere, and then come back and edit concepts.
1:24:56
That’s kind of interesting picture raised there.
1:25:02
You drew on your networks to get into this area that was difficult to get access to.
1:25:11
How many people were involved in the effort from the Andrews
1:25:13
group, besides yourself?
1:25:14
Well, many people.
1:25:15
So,
1:25:20
you were kind of
1:25:23
one way of getting into that area, you had some networks and other
1:25:28
people had things they could try.
1:25:29
Yeah.
1:25:29
We built social networks as we ran pulse programs up there for two weeks each
1:25:36
in the first two summers [of LTER era]
1:25:39
. Was that 1981 and 1982?
1:25:42
In 1981 and we had
1:25:47
one hundred and sixty people go through,
1:25:54
up to a hundred at a time.
1:25:57
The external media were represented.
1:25:59
We had
1:26:01
USGS and Weyerhaeuser, the University of Washington, our own people,
1:26:04
but a lot of other people, too.
1:26:05
Our people helped staff
1:26:11
it, and
1:26:14
then, when it came time to write the management plan for the National
1:26:18
Volcanic Monument, or even give input into how the monument geography might
1:26:22
be designed to provide representation of the geological and ecological
1:26:25
features of interest, they came to us.
1:26:25
So, part of the point is
1:26:33
we go out and tend to new jobs or explore new things, and come back
1:26:38
and infuse that into our concepts.
1:26:40
That’s kind of the rejuvenation thing you were talking about earlier.
1:26:44
Bringing it back.
1:26:44
How exactly do you mean bringing it back?
1:26:47
Bringing it back with ideas or new insights on how to approach questions
1:26:52
you’ve already had before on the Andrews?
1:26:54
Yeah.
1:26:55
Or people that you involved outside, that you bring in to the Andrews?
1:27:00
Yeah, all of the above.
1:27:03
Do you have any examples of a particular experience?
1:27:09
There are some particular things through LTER, for example, where we see what
1:27:15
others are doing and see opportunities to implement similar experiments.
1:27:29
There was a nutrient addition experiment on the Kuparak River at the Toolik
1:27:31
LTER site on the north slope of Alaska.
1:27:32
Stan Gregory, who was working on that topic, picked up on that and implemented
1:27:36
a similar experiment examining trophic cascades of nutrients through food webs
1:27:37
with new NSF funding on the Andrews.
1:27:40
I think that spring-boarded more sites to get interested
1:27:44
in that experimental approach.
1:27:45
Now, there’s a larger inter-site project going on, not with that
1:27:51
specific experimental approach, but
1:27:59
on questions that can be addressed through nutrient additions in streams.
1:28:04
So, we borrowed some stuff from elsewhere and brought it to the
1:28:07
Andrews and worked it out here.
1:28:10
Then, our folks participated in efforts to develop
1:28:16
experiments across a larger set of sites, and do comparative analysis.
1:28:22
Another example.
1:28:23
Mount St. Helens was pivotal in the legacy concept which then had a big role
1:28:29
in New Forestry, an alternative approach to forestry promoted by Jerry Franklin.
1:28:32
We went to Mount St. Helens, and initially thought the landscape
1:28:37
has been blasted, sterilized, and ecosystem responses would be starting
1:28:40
from scratch and be protracted.
1:28:42
We’re talking about primary succession, but right away, we
1:28:45
started seeing surviving organisms.
1:28:48
In the lakes, streams, upland forests and meadows, all kinds of different survival
1:28:56
mechanisms allowed species to survive.
1:29:02
Buried plant parts which would sprout, were liberated when small
1:29:06
gullies cut down through the new deposits to the old soil surface.
1:29:09
There was a big role of surviving plants and animals in much of the landscape.
1:29:17
And
1:29:21
that was a time when the clear-cut controversy was chugging away.
1:29:22
By the late 1980s, Jerry was advancing the concept of biological legacies and arguing
1:29:24
for retention of live trees and more
1:29:27
dead wood in cutting units – New Forestry concepts.
1:29:28
He’d say, “Let’s focus on what we leave on a logged site, rather than on
1:29:41
what we take away.” Mount St. Helens really stimulated that because it was such
1:29:46
a stark landscape, and that when something survived, you were surprised and noted it.
1:29:54
There is documentation of those ideas.
1:29:59
Yeah, that’s something I would like to take a look at.
1:30:04
I hadn’t really focused on that, but I think you mentioned that earlier.
1:30:08
Yeah.
1:30:11
Was it
1:30:20
you and Jerry Franklin walking up the hill, this is the way it
1:30:24
appeared on the internet anyway,
1:30:29
mainly if you have some documentation or is there a report filed on that?
1:30:36
Yeah,
1:30:46
I think some of the key ideas are represented in the article
1:30:49
in National Geographic Research.
1:30:50
Then, there had
1:31:01
been some subsequent things.
1:31:19
Also, I think we could find some of the other literature that does talk
1:31:23
about the link back to New Forestry.
1:31:27
Actually, I think it’s discussed in the Journal of Forestry, article;
1:31:35
“Toward a New Forestry.” No, it’s in American Forests – and many other of his
1:31:39
[Franklin] writings of the late 1980s.
1:31:40
American Forests article?
1:31:44
Yeah, it discusses
1:31:49
carrying
1:31:55
the ideas from Mount St. Helens back to green forests.
1:32:03
We should probably call it quits for the day.
1:32:06
The general theme though, and this is something which you might want to
1:32:11
consider, is how to deal with networks.
1:32:16
These networks include networks of sites which may one time or
1:32:21
persistent experiments elsewhere.
1:32:23
We conduct research in networks of natural areas and other experimental forests.
1:32:30
The Andrews sits in a whole series of nested webs and networks.
1:32:37
Yeah, this is what we were talking about in some of our earlier meetings, isn’t it?
1:32:41
One of the more interesting things about this project.
