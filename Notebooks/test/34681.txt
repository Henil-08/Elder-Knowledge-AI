00:01
This is an interview with Bob Tarrant at his house in Corvallis
00:04
Oregon, on the 24th of July, 1997.
00:09
The time is one o’clock in the afternoon.
00:32
You were one of the first six that it was recommended I talk to about
00:35
the history of the Andrews Forest and the people working there.
00:37
I got a couple of other people before you, just because I happened to run
00:40
across them at an opportune moment.
00:44
Here’s
00:52
the prospectus for the book that these interviews will feed into [Gives
00:59
Tarrant copy of prospectus] . We had a workshop session last August where Fred
01:08
Swanson and Art McKee and Ted Dyrness and others and I sat down and hashed
01:15
out some general goals, what we wanted to try and accomplish with this book.
01:21
I’ll leave that prospectus with you, too.
01:23
You might look especially at some of the ideas on science topics and other
01:27
things that have been included in there.
01:29
I just
01:34
was interested in names.
01:37
On the first page are some names of people that are projected to
01:41
be interviewed, and a fair number of them I’ve gotten to already.
01:45
This will be aimed at the Andrews only, right?
01:51
Basically, what we’re looking at is the Andrews Experimental Forest and the
01:54
research group that evolved out of that.
01:56
It includes connections off the Andrews, but the Andrews is the
01:59
focus of it, and then, the community of scientists that’s evolved.
02:05
There’s been a lot more work done there, but the Wind River Experimental
02:09
Forest across the Columbia,
02:14
is by far the oldest [exp.
02:16
forest in NW]
02:19
. I was interested whether this
02:23
involved a general pulling together of research done in the Cascades
02:27
of Oregon and Washington, or
02:31
specifically, the Andrews.
02:33
Specifically the Andrews.
02:33
It’s coming out to essentially celebrate the 50-year
02:36
anniversary which is next year.
02:41
The work in the Wind River area is important because it put Jerry
02:44
Franklin central to this work, he has been involved up there [and grew up
02:48
nearby] . But the focus has been the Andrews, and then, we’ll be branching
02:52
off of that to connections with Wind River, Cascade Head, and places like
02:56
that, but the main focus is on the Andrews
03:03
and the people who worked there.
03:04
To recap, we had an interview a couple of years ago, I don’t know
03:08
if you recall or not, but that gave a general sense of your background.
03:12
I want to focus here more on, specifically, your perceptions of
03:18
the Northwest area forest research [mainly U.S. Forest Service/PNW
03:21
Station] , in the period from the 1940’s to 1979, when you left to go to OSU.
03:26
Is that right?
03:27
Yeah.
03:27
So,
03:29
just to make sure I’ve got the time right, so it doesn’t confuse me later.
03:35
You got your B.S. from OSU in 1941 in plant science/agricultural
03:41
resource economics, and went to the Soil Conservation Service in 1941
03:45
for three months until you went to the Navy during WWII, from 1941
03:48
till about 1946, is that right?
03:50
Yeah.
03:50
Then you came out and went directly back into forest research at the PNW Station,
04:00
from ‘46 until ‘50, then fought in the Korean war until ‘52, and from then
04:05
until ’79, you were at the PNW Station?
04:07
Is that right?
04:09
And from 1979 until the present, you’ve been either here at OSU
04:15
or doing research in forests?
04:20
Uh-huh [affirmative]
04:21
Let’s start out here.
04:26
At the time you became involved with the Forest Service, or with forest
04:30
research, about the time you graduated from OSU, or while you were at OSU,
04:37
from about 1941 to ‘50, what was your perception of forest research and
04:43
the station in particular.
04:44
Also, what was your understanding of academic priorities.
05:01
Forest Service research before 1946, which began
05:08
essentially, one starting date is given around 1898, was based in one of the first
05:19
priorities with the Forest Service, which is to discover
05:22
what’s out there in this new land
05:30
[under their charge] . That’s essentially what they called research.
05:38
What kind of trees are there?
05:40
Nobody knew what kind of trees there were.
05:43
What condition the forests were in?
05:45
There was really nothing known about it, nobody had studied it.
05:53
That really carried through
06:01
until 1946, when things changed a lot.
06:06
There was little
06:10
biological research in that early period.
06:14
Research was conditioned on trying to find out what we had here in these new forests.
06:28
It was a matter
06:32
of counting the resource, a timber inventory [basic inventory/surveys]
06:43
, defining characteristics of the trees as far as their usefulness, forest
06:51
products research which today is still
06:56
pushed.
07:04
How do you efficiently measure a non-cylindrical
07:18
piece of wood that you can’t afford to under-represent on samples?
07:22
Some of that still goes on today.
07:31
Wood as a product, essentially, drove this.
07:36
There was very little biological research.
07:39
You’ll run into some reports by Leo Isaac.
07:46
Leo was about, as I recall,
07:52
the only person out in the Northwest
07:57
interested in some of the biological aspects of it.
08:03
I mean, research was crude in those days compared to now, but
08:08
for the time,
08:11
finding out anything, Leo concentrated on regeneration, did a
08:15
lot to help regenerate, but again, it’s about trees as a product.
08:26
That may not have changed
08:30
except for WWII, and that shut research down for a few years.
08:35
When it came to open up again, there
08:40
was much better funding, suddenly.
08:45
That gave a chance to expand into
08:49
things like soil science,
08:53
things that didn’t have much to do with much in a lot of
08:56
people’s minds [beginning of
09:00
new paradigm]
09:01
. When you started working at the PNW Station in ‘46, were there
09:06
other people in soil science there, or were you essentially
09:09
the only person who was doing it?
09:10
I was the only one there.
09:13
I guess
09:19
I was the first person interested in soils on the scene, except
09:25
there was a little work done before, just kind of excursions from work in
09:31
the agricultural soils by university crops from Pullman and Oregon State.
09:38
From the period ‘47 to ‘50 or ‘52
09:51
or so, University of Washington and Oregon State,
09:57
hired soil scientists, and
10:03
it was suddenly legitimate to think about things like that.
10:07
You mean an ecologic forestry?
10:10
There was one professor in the soils department at
10:13
Oregon State, Chet Youngberg.
10:14
And
10:21
Dr. Stanley Gessel, at the University of Washington.
10:39
Weyerhaeuser had a
10:44
soil scientist, and Crown Zellerbach did for a while.
10:57
Was there much coordination or cooperation between the different soil
11:01
scientists and different agencies?
11:03
It was very close because we quickly built
11:10
a working group, which runs still today.
11:16
I’ve got a paper on it, I’ll try to find a copy for you upstairs I ripped it off for
11:24
some of the young folks today that have got this Oregon
11:28
Soil Science Society going.
11:32
Now that is a sideline that’s an interesting thing.
11:36
That group essentially is one of the new players that’s going today.
11:42
You were part of the founding of that?
11:45
Yeah.
11:47
Well, to bring us into focus here at that time in your work.
11:52
What did you consider to be the value and potential use of experimental
11:55
forest research in general to the kind of research you were in involved in?
12:01
We looked at them in the first few years, or many did, as a place where
12:10
you could do research and expect to come back in ten years or fifteen years,
12:17
and fifty years, and a hundred years.
12:20
It was a place where you could put an experiment in and expect it to
12:23
not to be erased by some action.
12:30
Long-term plots?
12:30
Yeah.
12:34
Then,
12:36
fairly quickly the point arose that,
12:43
being confined to a particular situation like that, didn’t
12:48
fit a lot of the research.
12:49
In other words, you wanted to sample a range of soil conditions
12:57
over an area.
13:00
Experimental forest was too small a unit for some kinds of studies,
13:06
although I did a lot of my work at Wind River and at the Andrews.
13:13
But they were limiting, eventually, because as we learned more, we
13:20
needed to do different things.
13:22
So, you did more of your work on the national forests?
13:26
Yes, if there was something that you needed to work on that wasn’t
13:33
represented on an experimental forest.
13:37
But,
13:40
much of the early work was concentrated really on those two experimental forests.
13:46
Wind River
13:50
and the University of Washington people did their work on Pack Forest.
14:00
Chet Youngberg did most of his work, I suppose, on the Pringle
14:04
Falls Experimental Forest.
14:06
He liked to dig in pumice, so that was nice digging.
14:13
It
14:18
sounds like you did a fair amount of work down at the Andrews in
14:20
that period in the early 50’s?
14:24
Yeah.
14:26
After I got back from the Korean War, I
14:33
did most of my work at the Andrews, at that point.
14:40
Have you got Roy Silen down as one of your interviewees?
14:42
Yeah, I was just going to ask you that if you were working there when he was there.
14:44
Well, Roy was there.
14:48
We had a trailer down on the highway.
14:55
I put in a number of studies there while Roy was laying the forest out.
15:02
He spent several years there, really working by himself.
15:06
In those days, nobody
15:12
thought much about the safety aspect of a guy working by himself.
15:17
Roy would go out for a week or ten days at a time.
15:23
None
15:26
of us wondered
15:29
about safety.
15:30
I don’t recall anybody ever getting in real trouble.
15:33
But, if you got far away from home, wandering around by yourself,
15:40
nobody had done anything about it.
15:43
You were there after the access road was put in?
15:46
Before.
15:49
I didn’t put any studies in before that, but I was interested in
15:56
getting a feel for what we had there and laying things out.
16:00
Backing up just a little bit, I was wondering if you had any recollections
16:01
about the establishment of the Blue River Experimental Forest in 1948,
16:03
as it was called at that time.
16:03
Do you have any recollections of the origins of it when you were
16:04
with the PNW Station at that
16:14
point?
16:16
It became a matter of
16:23
conversation, but I was not directly involved in it.
16:26
I was
16:29
pretty much brand new there.
16:33
At that time,
16:41
they were still looking at old growth.
16:48
And somebody realized that, really, the way things were going,
16:57
young growth, regeneration and young growth, were the real problems.
17:03
Because at that time, a group of us was discussing the other day, nobody thought
17:12
anything was special about the fact that the policy essentially was to replace the
17:21
old-growth forest of Oregon and Washington with young, more productive forests.
17:28
[Chuckle] Some
17:35
of my work was directed towards “what ifs”
17:43
as a result of logging.
17:46
Some of
17:49
that was probably the first concern about what were we doing.
17:56
The
18:00
point was that, what we needed
18:05
was an experimental forest
18:10
where you could
18:12
log a piece of land and had a lot of information about
18:18
that stand before you cut it.
18:21
Regenerate it, and follow through with research on young growth.
18:28
And most everybody’s point was, “How can we make it grow faster?” Weyerhaeuser in
18:32
those days had grabbed hold of this and had beautiful color ads, “We are growing
18:41
trees a third faster than ever they were grown before,” and things of that sort.
18:48
Much of that early research was how do you get them to grow faster.
18:54
But it had to do on the Andrews with
18:58
starting with an old growth and getting a chance to go clear
19:02
through a cycle, of cutting the old growth, regenerating and raising
19:11
the next crop.
19:15
Really thinking that we could do it better.
19:17
That was
19:20
what I still consider a fallacy; where they
19:24
could do it better,
19:28
or how do you can do it better than nature did it.
19:33
Things were very naive then, and we had no
19:38
biological background whatsoever.
19:42
What there was then was just very primitive.
19:44
There was no background
19:48
biological information.
19:50
And
19:52
that’s part of the problem today.
19:54
It
19:57
was
20:00
quite reasonable, cut these down and get you some trees that economically grew a
20:04
certain way, that are going to be better for the world than these old trees are,
20:12
just hanging on.
20:15
Why not use the ground for faster
20:23
growth.
20:24
We had quite a discussion a while back about that.
20:28
Were you involved in some early theorizing about moving to a 300-year
20:37
rotation instead of a 100-year rotation.
20:39
Were you aware of any of that at that time?
20:44
How important was that?
20:45
Roy was thinking about that?
20:47
Yeah, several people have mentioned that, and I’m not sure what the timeline was
20:51
when he started being involved in that.
20:53
He had a paper that, I got a copy of it, came out I think in ‘50 or ’55, where
20:59
he was talking about that possibility.
21:04
No, I don’t recall anything.
21:05
I never heard Roy talk about that.
21:14
Going back to
21:17
what you were saying here about the need to replace old growth and get
21:22
more vigorous, productive stands.
21:26
What kinds of projects or programs were you involved with in that time that
21:30
related to those kinds of concerns?
21:33
For
21:40
five years, I pretty much specialized most of my effort
21:44
into the effects of slash burning.
21:47
There
21:51
were concerns about what that was doing.
21:55
I
21:59
probably spent maybe a five-year period on that.
22:06
I did some work early on forest-fertilizing, when that began to be
22:18
popular with the companies.
22:20
I never felt good about that as a silvicultural
22:28
method.
22:29
I did studies on individually fertilizing
22:37
trees and fertilizing the planting hole that you put a tree in.
22:47
Later in the game,
22:54
1965 I think it was,
22:58
I got back into fertilizer, when people were having trouble using urea
23:06
instead of other nitrogen fertilizers.
23:11
And I put in a study that’s become
23:18
quite well known, and a landmark.
23:22
I used ammonium nitrate, and we have re-measured that for 30-35
23:32
years.
23:34
The effect of that
23:37
single fertilizing is still
23:42
visible in measurements.
23:45
But it was
23:48
certainly not intended as an economic measure, because it’s a lot cheaper
23:53
to throw urea out of a helicopter, because a pound of it is 50%
23:59
nitrogen, and this stuff is 21-22%.
24:05
That’s
24:08
a study that you did on the Andrews?
24:10
Did that at Wind River.
24:15
And then I got
24:18
interested in using nitrogen-fixing plants, particularly
24:24
alder, essentially as a
24:31
crop rotation where you can grow it.
24:36
I probably put more time into that than I did in anything else from then on.
24:43
Attempting to find something like the use of legumes in agriculture.
24:50
We wondered about the same possibility in forests with
24:53
nitrogen-fixing tree species, but
24:57
it’s pretty hard to
25:00
sell to people that can’t see anything other than Douglas-fir,
25:02
Douglas-fir, and Douglas-fir.
25:06
But that’s been an interesting thing.
25:08
We published it in Oregon State press book about four or five years
25:15
ago, and wrapped up what we knew about it and what needed to be done.
25:22
Well, if you could think here a little bit about what your first impressions
25:27
were of the Andrews Experimental Forest when you started working there.
25:32
What your first perceptions were?
25:33
Oh,
25:36
it was another place to work.
25:41
I really turned away from them, from
25:47
the Wind River work, because what I was doing up there was pretty well along, and
25:54
this was a chance to work on a new area.
25:57
New climate, new soil, so I put a lot of time in down there, because, I guess
26:04
it was
26:10
new.
26:10
New and interesting [H.J. Andrews] . I didn’t think much
26:15
of it or think in terms of
26:19
it being one day a world-class operation.
26:25
It
26:28
was
26:50
another place, another place to work.
26:52
Hmm-hm.
26:52
[affirmative] Did you run across anybody else there besides Roy Silen?
26:56
People that were working down there or people that were based there?
27:03
Yes, throughout the years.
27:06
We had people based down there.
27:10
Dick Fredriksen, who’s gone.
27:15
Henry Gratkowski [early HJA researcher
27:21
who worked with Silen] . Much of the water work was done out of Corvallis,
27:26
headquartered in Corvallis, because the watershed project worked both on the
27:32
Bull Run Watershed near Portland and
27:39
also had the basic watershed studies at the Andrews.
27:48
I
27:50
think this was the beginning of
27:54
some really critical work at the Andrews, addressing a very critical problem.
28:01
The first full-size watershed study was done down there, and I
28:07
worked with Jack Rothacher on that.
28:36
When was that roughly?
28:36
Oh, it was 50’s and 60’s.
28:37
That’s still very productive work up there.
28:43
Good example of something you can do on an area that’s set aside and will
28:48
be there when you go back in decades.
28:53
Do you remember where on the Andrews you were focusing your
28:55
work, a particular watershed?
29:00
Oh, it’s off the access road in there.
29:03
They had to get concrete trucks in when they built weirs and, it’s
29:11
not too far
29:15
after you pass the reservoir at Blue River there.
29:20
I don’t know if it’s before or after you get to the headquarters
29:25
site, but it’s very accessible, partly for snow, for one thing.
29:30
They had to have a place they could get to year-round
29:36
[HJA watershed 1, 2 or 3; unsure which as description is unclear]
29:36
. So, it’s right down there between the headquarters and the river down there?
29:38
Yeah, somewhere in there, it’s close to the river.
29:47
Do you recall, since you’re kind of in the same area of research, do
29:52
you recall working with Ted Dyrness when he started working there?
29:58
I never worked with Ted.
30:01
By that time I’d gone onto something else, I guess.
30:07
I knew Ted as a graduate student, and a
30:15
couple of days ago I saw him.
30:17
But I didn’t do any work with Ted, directly.
30:24
Was he down there at all at the time you were working on the Andrews?
30:27
I don’t associate him with the Andrews, but he probably was during
30:31
the International Geophysical Year
30:37
. Jerry Franklin came down there and started working in the late ‘50s,
30:41
also . Did you work at all with him?
30:43
Because he was not expressly in soils, more on ecology.
30:47
I
30:49
knew Jerry all the way along there, from the time he came to the [PNW] station.
30:56
We did some fertilizer studies down there together.
31:01
But we didn’t do any joint-studies.
31:05
Well, I can’t say that either, we published some stuff from Cascade Head.
31:10
I didn’t mention Cascade Head yet, an interesting study.
31:20
So, you’ve known Jerry for years?
31:22
I’ve known Jerry since he came there,
31:27
before he left and did a Ph.D. and came back.
31:32
He was there pretty early in the game.
31:32
Do you recall anything about
31:37
living arrangements and logistics of going down there to work?
31:41
Did you tend to go down there to work for the day and then drive back,
31:44
or did you go down there and stay in the trailer you’ve mentioned?
31:45
I stayed in the trailer.
31:46
Later on, there was a
31:53
bunkhouse up there
31:57
at McKenzie Bridge.
32:00
Roy Silen lived at McKenzie Bridge over the grocery store.
32:06
He’d just gotten married,
32:10
but before that, he lived in the trailer, he lived there in a bunkhouse.
32:13
It was an old CCC
32:23
bunkhouse, I believe.
32:23
But, just above McKenzie Bridge.
32:25
But, nothing like there are today.
32:27
This was sort of
32:30
a crude arrangement.
32:35
I’m curious, because Roy talked about what you’d call “primeval forest” conditions.
32:42
And schools of over a thousand fish and things like that.
32:47
Do you recall your perception of the game?
32:50
Yeah.
32:50
In the evening when we got through work, we’d meet somewhere down
32:56
there along the Blue River, where some roads came together.
32:59
We had one fly rod, used barbed hooks, and we traded off every night.
33:07
One night one would fish that hole until they caught five fish
33:12
or something like that, measure ‘em, and they would keep records.
33:18
We had a kind of informal competition.
33:20
[Chuckle] That’s before there were any fishery biologists up there.
33:24
I recall there was one pretty good-size trout.
33:29
He had a bite out of its side.
33:32
An otter had caught it and missed, and we would catch that fish about every
33:36
third or fourth night, turn him back.
33:40
Had a name for it.
33:43
Yeah, that was a pristine creek.
33:50
Not much of anybody had been up there.
33:54
You know, that wasn’t too that long ago, that was the 50’s.
33:57
[Chuckle] A lot of the country is still
34:04
unroaded.
34:04
There’s
34:07
a quite a change though when you go down there now.
34:10
Have you seen that?
34:11
Yeah, it’s a little much for me.
34:19
When you were working in Corvallis,
34:23
you started a project with Bill Needham on forest chemicals in ’64.
34:29
I got this from the last interview.
34:33
Who else at OSU were you working with in this period of
34:35
time, in the late 50’s, early
34:45
60’s.
34:45
Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring , and
34:53
industry groups wasted two years or more fighting her and writing white papers
35:01
and defending [the status quo] , until somebody in research was smart enough to
35:04
say this is dumb, we can get money out of this, and let’s get some information.
35:10
We got a dab of money and a big promise of a whole lot more [for
35:14
research] . I was asked to go down to Corvallis and set up a project on this.
35:20
Nobody knew anything about it, really.
35:24
I certainly didn’t.
35:25
I
35:27
hired one of my old profs, Dr. Bolen.
35:33
Hired Logan Norris for that project.
35:37
Hired
35:40
the only two people capable of analyzing material for DDT
35:48
and some of the other chemicals.
35:53
We had a very successful project that
35:58
ran about eight years..
36:03
Then, I left and Logan Norris took that over.
36:06
[Mid-1960s to early 1970s, research on DDT/other chemicals]
36:09
. About ‘72, is that right?
36:12
70’, yeah 70’, 71’, 72’, something like that.
36:17
Then I went back to Portland.
36:23
That was kind of the end of research until I get to retire
36:26
and come back to Oregon State.
36:29
As life went on you’re more involved in the administrative side of forestry?
36:33
Yeah, I went in there as assistant director, and then
36:39
became director [PNW Station] Well, I got frustrated with money situations
36:49
and came back down here and went to work for the university for eight years.
36:53
The period when you were doing
37:00
that was in the middle of that was the period when the RNA issue began to heat
37:06
up a little bit in the Northwest here.
37:08
Jerry Franklin and Ted Dyrness were talking about their efforts to build a
37:13
“research natural area” system out here.
37:18
Were you involved?
37:18
Well, yeah it was obvious that at the rate things were going at that point, if there
37:25
were going to be any more research natural areas established, it had to be soon.
37:41
That’s my main recollection, that Jerry and Ted got together and were a
37:46
very effective team for pushing this.
37:52
They got a lot of those established, and I don’t know the fate of those.
38:05
They worked hard on that for a number of years.
38:08
From your perspectives, what’s the relationship between an experimental
38:12
forest and a research natural area?
38:13
Are they are complimentary?
38:15
Did you make much use of them?
38:17
No, I didn’t.
38:20
I
38:29
never heard a good argument stated for them, except when you’re interested
38:36
in saving a piece of an ecosystem as an example for the future.
38:45
The research part of that
38:49
name, had to do with,
38:54
“We need to save some samples of diverse things that we may need someday to
39:08
get to for information and guidance on
39:14
things.” I don’t think they were ever heavily used for research,
39:20
and I think the research part of that title was really that
39:27
we might need them for research.
39:32
It was a good idea, but I don’t know what’s happened to that. We’ve
39:37
got one out there on the Finley Wildlife Refuge, a patch of
39:49
native grassland
39:53
that was saved.
39:57
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a sign out there, for instance, indicating
40:02
that there’s anything there.
40:08
One thing I was thinking of here, is the perception of how the [USFS]
40:12
research natural area program influenced the use of experimental forests.
40:17
Was
40:22
the concept of having this natural space area as something that is worthy of study?
40:30
Did you get any feedback from that in case of the experimental forests?
40:34
No, I can’t think of any relation.
40:42
I haven’t thought of research natural areas for a long time.
40:48
I guess I’ll be interested in trying to find out what’s become of that movement.
40:53
Whether that was a nice thing at the moment.
40:56
The
40:58
forest that’s in the early days of forest research, obviously
41:03
in the 20’s, they immediately
41:09
set out growth plots, which were measured every 10 years, I guess.
41:16
Kind of forerunner to the forest survey.
41:21
Had those all over, until latter days when funding became a problem.
41:30
We just didn’t have the manpower to measure them.
41:32
Had to give ‘em away [chuckle], all sorts of universities took over
41:36
some, and that was the end of it.
41:37
So,
41:42
I can’t speak on that
41:56
subject.
41:56
I want to shift focus a little bit.
41:56
Franklin and Ted both saw evolving perception of studies
41:59
they wanted to do, individually.
42:02
The way I understood it, it was
42:06
a transforming experience for them, just like the politics of trying to
42:09
set up the research natural areas.
42:13
But it sounds like you weren’t going in that direction?
42:15
No, I was not involved in that.
42:18
That was really pretty much a two-man effort.
42:25
They published some findings, basic reference books
42:37
that are good today,
42:41
encyclopedias of invertebrate animals.
42:46
They did just a whole lot of work.
42:49
Then Ted went to Alaska, and that’s the last I recall of that activity.
42:55
Well, another tack here.
42:58
The International Biological Program began to
43:06
attract funding out at the Andrews or support research on the Andrews,
43:10
between about 1968 and 1978, and I kind of roughly parallel the time you began
43:14
to move into administrative positions and on to PNW Station Director, so I
43:22
want to talk about that a little bit.
43:23
Because several people have raised the IBP up as kind of a center piece for
43:27
the emergence of the Andrews group.
43:30
I agree.
43:34
What are your recollections of the IBP program and the importance
43:39
of that program to the Pacific Northwest Station at that time?
43:43
And the responsibilities of the station?
43:45
I was not involved in IBP at all.
43:52
Each assistant director had a different area, and I had Alaska
43:56
at the time and other things.
43:59
I was never involved in IBP other than
44:04
continuing some of the studies I had down there, but I did not get
44:08
involved in the IBP work as such.
44:11
I think Oregon State University
44:19
got more out of that as far as upgrading the level of the research
44:27
that they did, and the station as far as
44:35
getting out so much applied research of measuring growth, things of that
44:40
sort, and looking at processes.
44:45
I think Oregon State University’s research staff probably
44:55
gained more growth out of it than the Forest Service side, because we were
45:01
hiring new people and the Oregon State people had kind of a different attitude.
45:07
In the university it’s hard to
45:23
get a lot of interest in, “Let’s all get together and do something.” This is
45:27
an unprecedented thing that happened.
45:31
[Long-term ecosystem research - groups] Do you have Dick Waring on your list?
45:34
Yeah,
45:36
I need to track him down.
45:37
Yeah, you need to talk to Dick because he was
45:42
the young researcher who really found himself in that program, and
45:52
had a strong hand in maintaining it, and being a supporter
45:58
and getting support for it.
46:01
That would be my viewpoint.
46:02
The
46:05
university program was strengthened and led to
46:14
doing more university-level process work,
46:24
but that also it welded together better.
46:30
When we [Forest Service] built this lab on this campus down here, there just
46:35
wasn’t any competition for anything.
46:41
As administrators, we had a heck of a time
46:45
beating on our people to
46:50
work with other people.
46:52
We’re putting you on a university campus with libraries and all the
47:00
things.
47:00
It was always a chore, but the IBP drew those who got involved in it.
47:09
And suddenly things were kind of integrated,
47:14
as if they were one organization for that group.
47:17
So, it was
47:22
more of a focused or coordinated effort.
47:24
Yeah, up to that point, I saw some of that later on lingering in a few people.
47:32
Your counterpart over at the university that had the same title
47:37
as you were – “so and so,” a plant physiologist or something – was a
47:44
threat, if you weren’t very sure of yourself.
47:48
We had a heck of a time,
47:52
meet with the dean regularly and talked about this problem, and how do you do it.
47:59
But, the IBP had that wonderful effect
48:06
of making everybody grow up
48:09
and have some pride in the kinds of things they were doing, new things.
48:13
I
48:28
say there was no background of biological information.
48:33
The industry and some people in the Forest Service had a pet saying that, “An
48:39
old-growth stand is a biological desert.”
48:44
Of course, this IBP [research results, holistic way of thinking] just blew
48:45
that all away, but that was the level of thinking, the propaganda that was laid
48:54
down. “Well, gee, this stuff’s no good.
48:55
It just sits there.
48:58
Animals don’t use it, no life there, these trees are barely living.
49:05
Let’s do nature a favor and get rid of it.” [Chuckle] So, it got rid of
49:11
that “biological desert” idea about old-growth forests, and started
49:20
informed,
49:23
more mature thinking on the subject.
49:28
So, although I was not directly involved in IBP because of the circumstances at the
49:34
time, I was thoroughly familiar with it.
49:37
Spent quite a bit of time down there with people or taking
49:45
visitors into that to explain.
49:50
I think IBP and the Andrews were just one of the really significant things of my
50:00
time I observed forest research.
50:03
In terms of directing the station at that time, did the activities of IBP
50:10
change the kinds of questions that researchers were encouraged to pursue or
50:16
the kinds of questions that management was asking of research to try and address?
50:23
No, the IBP research really went beyond what managers could
50:31
conceive of as a question.
50:35
We had a little trouble at first, I think with managers saying, “What good
50:39
is that gonna do us if you go around looking at angleworms?” or something like
50:47
that.
50:47
That’s another long-hard-pull story but.......No, I don’t think
50:58
it changed the way
51:04
research was done except again in that context of that group.
51:12
They had a chance to do group thinking, had some group
51:16
agreements, and group prioritizing.
51:23
But within the station, there’s so many different kinds of things.
51:27
Forest products, forest survey, none of that
51:34
practical work, you might call it, the meat and potatoes stuff,
51:41
wasn’t changed by it at that point, because that really didn’t affect the
51:51
questions they were asking.
51:53
Later, of course, it would affect them, and they had to consider it from then on.
51:57
To
52:00
have a different idea of what
52:12
that forest was.
52:13
But the IBP was the glory days of the Andrews.
52:17
You talked earlier about the difference between applied research
52:20
and more profit-oriented research.
52:24
The period we’ve just gone over is the 1950’s till about
52:31
the mid 1970’s.
52:34
What kinds of changes occurred in that period in terms of what management
52:37
was looking for from research?
52:40
Was there much change?
52:49
I think that
52:59
much of my time in research
53:11
for that period, 30-some-odd years, that research was a threat
53:25
to established ways of doing things.
53:32
I was told quite frankly in a number of cases by
53:41
people in the management side, that
53:45
research really wasn’t helping them.
53:47
In fact, it hindered them somewhat, and threw out ideas that
53:54
didn’t jibe with policies.
54:00
I was told that quite bluntly that this was one fear of the
54:05
other side of the Forest Service
54:11
[management] . Forest Service research, we were physically
54:16
separated until I left the station.
54:21
Up to that point we were housed on the other side of the river from the
54:26
regional office in Portland [Region 6 office of National Forest system] . We
54:30
maintained our own headquarters, our own personnel and business functions.
54:38
That was for a purpose.
54:41
If somebody wanted to talk about timber sales, they
54:46
should go to the
54:53
national forests.
54:56
It may not a national policy, but research was physically separated most times from
55:01
the operating [land management] branch of the Forest Service, for a good purpose.
55:05
It’s rather amazing that Forest Service research has got along
55:10
as well as it has with the
55:13
people raising the question we were accused of, “Well, you’re working for
55:17
the Forest Service, and you find out what the Service wants to know.” Really,
55:22
the opposite was true because I had some people in the operating branch [National
55:31
Forest system] who would say, “I’ve got no time to read that crap,” all that stuff.
55:36
“Can’t read it anyway, can’t make anything out of it.” Or, “Why don’t
55:40
you write simply,” that sort of
55:46
thing.
55:46
Talking about the
55:49
impact of research on management, was always an “arm’s-length” thing.
55:54
Now, that has changed to
56:00
some extent during the crisis years [“Forest Wars,” spotted owl controversy]
56:02
. I know they were glad to bring some of us in when they were being attacked in
56:09
the Congressional hearings about impacts on watersheds, the effects of forest
56:10
chemicals and things of that nature.
56:10
I did Congressional hearings
56:26
and headed stuff for the National Academy of Sciences,
56:36
things of that sort.
56:36
It
56:47
was a boon for the research side during the forest crisis.
56:51
In the mid 70’s?
56:56
70’s?
56:56
Yeah,
56:59
especially.
57:04
We had something to talk about then, as a result of work at the Andrews.
57:11
Which was something other than, we measure these trees, or we did
57:16
something to a stand, we measured the growth, and it did so and so.
57:19
We had some concrete evidence these systems were tender
57:19
things that could be harmed.
57:19
And so, we had something
57:42
to talk about the way they worked,
57:45
which we never had to before.
57:46
Do you think that’s something that’s possible because of the IBP program?
57:50
I think the IBP contributed much more than anything, to that sort of information.
58:02
The first part,
58:05
zero to
58:11
1946, when things opened up after the war,
58:16
everything was pragmatic.
58:20
At that point, some new things were introduced that undoubtedly
58:26
took a while to take hold, and
58:34
there was a little more consideration given to soils; erosion, damage to soil,
58:39
things of that sort.
58:46
These are biological systems, they’re not physical plots of
58:53
[inert] material out there.
58:57
So,
59:00
I think
59:05
from year-to-year, “Gee, we just
59:09
don’t seem to be getting anywhere with
59:14
this long, full process, to start from ground zero with this biological
59:18
thing.” But at the end of my time I can look back and think, really, a
59:25
handful of people at the universities, and Forest Service, some of the other
59:34
agencies, really developed a heck of a lot of information.
59:40
Starting from dark ages up to where there were some new concepts, and certainly a
59:50
portion of the population knows that.
59:52
Do you think that
1:00:17
the adaptive management initiative of the Andrews in recent years is a shift,
1:00:25
at least in the Blue River District and on Willamette National Forest, in
1:00:28
terms of willingness to look through the research and to cooperate with
1:00:33
them [researchers] in identifying problems you studied and how to apply
1:00:37
the research on the national forests?
1:00:41
Did that begin to change while you were director up there?
1:00:48
I suppose there were changes.
1:00:54
They may have been subtle, maybe nobody was talking about
1:00:58
it, but ideas were changing.
1:00:59
I know about the adaptive management program, and have worked with
1:01:04
Bernard Bormann on that since.
1:01:08
I keep a courtesy appointment with the university for the working platform
1:01:13
[for adaptive management, innovative methods] . I’m probably the oldest
1:01:16
non-paid employee they’ve got.
1:01:19
[Chuckle].
1:01:22
I
1:01:25
don’t know if I speak with authority on that.
1:01:28
I
1:01:32
would be amazed if there was not increased interest in the management side,
1:01:42
getting help and trying to do new things.
1:01:49
But, I don’t have observations.
1:01:54
I would expect that to happen, and it’s what we wrote
1:02:02
in the book draft.
1:02:04
That’s
1:02:07
the way it should be.
1:02:09
I was just curious in the specific case of the Andrews, if any names of
1:02:14
people come to mind for you from the Willamette National Forest, people
1:02:16
who might have been more receptive to working with research than others,
1:02:23
at the time when you were director of the station?
1:02:34
When
1:02:40
I came to the station in
1:02:44
the postwar period, there was practically no conversation between the station,
1:02:51
which was in the federal courthouse up on Broadway in Portland, and the regional
1:02:56
office, which was on the other end of Broadway in the Post Office building.
1:03:01
There wasn’t much of a relationship at all.
1:03:09
It must be entirely different, just because
1:03:16
younger people were coming in all the time, as each generation comes in.
1:03:19
I watched the
1:03:24
arrival of “tennis shoe” rangers.
1:03:26
The early rangers
1:03:29
were
1:03:31
non-college people, who were real woodsmen.
1:03:38
[Cultural shifts in Forest Service regarding types of
1:03:39
people gaining entrance.]
1:03:39
Tennis shoe rangers you said?
1:03:39
Yeah.
1:03:41
[Chuckle].
1:03:41
A number of them, instead of wearing cork boots [logging boots with
1:03:43
spikes] , they wore tennis shoes.
1:03:45
Said they beat cork boots, and cork boots are dangerous.
1:03:48
And
1:03:52
those were tough, old guys, and there’s a great story told about them.
1:03:58
They had difficulties with a logger doing something they didn’t like,
1:04:03
and he didn’t clean up his act.
1:04:06
These guys would stand and beat each other up on a sandbar somewhere, and
1:04:12
it was a
1:04:15
pretty “friendly” thing. But, there were a lot of people who reacted like
1:04:20
me; and I used to be aghast about that. I thought, “Gee, how can you do
1:04:26
that?” They were dedicated people who knew their job in the woods.
1:04:36
Their job was to facilitate getting these trees out.
1:04:42
I recall as a youth that
1:04:48
I thought, “What the heck are you ever gonna do to sell these people on some new
1:04:53
ideas?” But, you could see that change.
1:04:57
Unfortunately, a
1:04:59
few funerals now and then, are a good thing [meaning generational turnover and
1:05:02
change] . But you could see that change, and I watched changes in the attitude of
1:05:09
forest supervisors.
1:05:13
One would start out with one of them,
1:05:16
suggesting we stay off of his forest, even when his people bothered me
1:05:21
about standing around talking about
1:05:29
the environment.
1:05:30
Here you’ve got people two generations into the
1:05:38
world where you talk about the environment and environmentalism,
1:05:44
and to be better, with programs or something else.
1:05:50
It’d be pretty hard to measure, because,
1:05:57
you take a person that on the ranger district that might have made an
1:06:01
observation, “Gosh, I wonder if we were doing right?” and might see something in a
1:06:06
research publication and say, “Gee, that’s just what I was thinking!” I don’t know.
1:06:16
Several people have identified Steve Eubanks as a ranger who was really
1:06:21
receptive to working closely with research down there [HJA EF] in the mid
1:06:26
70’s [Actually was early to mid-1980s]
1:06:26
. Yeah, he’s a good example.
1:06:30
I don’t know what ever happened to him?
1:06:31
I think he’s up in Minnesota somewhere.
1:06:33
He’s a forest supervisor [Chippewa N.F.] , now.
1:06:36
I need to track him down sometime before the end of the summer [Eubanks was later
1:06:39
interviewed for HJA history project] . Let me shift gears a little bit here.
1:06:43
In about 1977 to about 1978, there were increasing concerns about administration
1:06:51
of the headquarters site on the Andrews.
1:06:53
And there was eventually, a formalization of the arrangement of
1:06:57
how that was going to be administered between the station and the forest.
1:07:01
Well,
1:07:04
the regional forester at that time, felt very strongly that first, as I
1:07:11
recall, there was some reluctance to get involved in that [LTER site/system]
1:07:16
. Who was that?
1:07:17
Oh, I forget who it was.
1:07:21
You know that the Andrews is named after a
1:07:28
Forest Service person.
1:07:30
Yeah, a former researcher in the Forest Service.
1:07:31
[also a Regional Forester]
1:07:33
It was somebody after him.
1:07:37
I often wondered, and was not privy to the arrangements in those days, but I
1:07:42
often wondered if part of that naming of the forest didn’t have to do with
1:07:53
placating the National Forest system [regarding management classifications
1:07:54
and innovation, with H.J. Andrews, Region 6 Chief Forester, likely
1:07:56
future Chief in Washington D.C., killed in an auto accident while
1:07:57
looking at homes for a family move]
1:08:04
. At any rate, I do recall a period when the regional forester
1:08:14
was fighting to get a ruling from the Washington office that
1:08:23
any timber
1:08:26
cut on the experimental forest for experimental purposes would
1:08:35
be placed under his allowable cut
1:08:42
number goal.
1:08:45
And that any timber that came off there would be credited to his allowable cut.
1:08:51
Well, you can see the obvious there.
1:08:55
It was a good example of
1:09:00
the
1:09:02
two different goals that didn’t ever come together very well [between USFS
1:09:07
National Forest system and USFS research.]
1:09:09
Yeah, Silen talked a little bit about that.
1:09:10
Yeah, it went on and on and on and finally,
1:09:15
whatever happened, it was not allowable to get away with it.
1:09:20
But,
1:09:26
that was kind of typical of the time.
1:09:27
Do you recall when or why it became necessary to draw up a formal
1:09:33
agreement between the station and
1:09:37
Oregon State University?
1:09:39
There was formal memorandum of agreement.
1:09:43
Steve signed it.
1:09:46
That came as a result of, what’s the date?
1:09:52
There are a couple of them.
1:09:54
Yeah, there were a few.
1:09:55
The one that I’m talking about right now, is called Master Memorandum
1:09:59
of Understanding 1978, August 1978.
1:10:02
[Original OSU-USFS MOU was in 1961, a basic framework one.]
1:10:10
I think
1:10:14
pretty much we had operated on
1:10:18
the basis of the International Geophysical Year, which began that cooperation.
1:10:25
This was an invitational sort of
1:10:33
thing.
1:10:33
My assignment didn’t involve anything directly with that, but it was a sort
1:10:42
of, “Come on over and,
1:10:46
you can use some of our property.” And then, the thing
1:10:57
just sort of
1:11:03
took care of itself, pretty much.
1:11:06
There were things that would come up quite normally that required attention.
1:11:12
So, with some years’ experience in that thing, and then the
1:11:24
IBP tapered off, as did all that great funding that was coming into us from
1:11:31
outside the Forest Service budget, and
1:11:36
the people didn’t want to break this up.
1:11:38
It was operating too well.
1:11:41
So, we decided that
1:11:46
we had to have some understanding about who paid for what, and all the nuts
1:11:52
and bolts of finally running this thing presumably forever, I hope so anyway.
1:12:03
This required a
1:12:08
contract of some sort to
1:12:13
keep from destroying it some way in
1:12:17
sloppy operation.
1:12:18
[Preparation for more permanent facilities and long-term arrangements,
1:12:18
come to fruition under LTER]
1:12:19
. What was the main concern then?
1:12:21
What kind of problems might emerge, if that wasn’t done?
1:12:25
Oh, I think the university people had one way of doing things,
1:12:28
and Forest Service, another.
1:12:33
Protection of the resource?
1:12:35
No.
1:12:35
I think it was
1:12:41
kind of our “prenuptial agreement,” something of that sort.
1:12:46
In case it breaks down?
1:12:48
In case it breaks down, who does what?
1:12:51
What commitments are made by both parties?
1:12:54
But,
1:12:57
as long as the money was flowing in, it ran pretty well.
1:13:04
It was just a housekeeping thing.
1:13:08
I don’t think it had anything to do with the resource.
1:13:10
Was there any difficulty in negotiating that or was that pretty straightforward?
1:13:14
No, I think it was just a matter of, “Maybe we better put things together.”
1:13:20
And
1:13:23
I think
1:13:25
the dean [OSU-COF] wanted to protect what they had in it.
1:13:33
Maybe Dick Waring can give you some better insights on that.
1:13:38
He was involved in those negotiations then?
1:13:40
I think so.
1:13:41
I think by that time [IBP era] he was pretty much the OSU representative.
1:13:46
That’s one of the kinds of things we wanted – to have one guy named by the dean
1:13:52
to speak for him.
1:13:57
That’s what I mean, it was just housekeeping.
1:14:01
I think under that agreement Art McKee began as
1:14:10
the on-site director at the Andrews.
1:14:12
Was there any concern in the Forest Service about having an OSU employee
1:14:18
managing a property of the Forest Service?
1:14:23
I think by that time, those people
1:14:27
wanted to step out of things, that nobody
1:14:32
wanted to rock boats.
1:14:41
What’s your perception of how
1:14:44
priorities in research have changed since you stepped down as station director?
1:14:49
You talked earlier about your perception of experimental forests
1:14:53
and what their purpose was.
1:14:55
Looking at the Andrews now, from 1980 to the present, what would
1:15:01
you see as the really more important changes?
1:15:05
Again, I’m not
1:15:08
very closely associated with that, but I think there’s been a move.
1:15:22
I think the main thing I’ve seen is a move to stop doing the old-line
1:15:30
research, like straight-out silviculture.
1:15:35
Silviculture is
1:15:40
still kind of the basic, “How fast and how good can we raise a tree?” And, I
1:15:47
think the recognition by this time, is that this is a complex thing. That’s
1:15:55
been demonstrated as being certainly a more fragile thing than we knew
1:16:04
60 years ago.
1:16:05
Things since I left the station have
1:16:22
pretty much
1:16:27
involved people, whose old-line, measurement jobs, are being
1:16:34
threatened.
1:16:35
There’s kind of
1:16:42
a fight to keep that going – just straight silviculture, doing the
1:16:48
“growth-and-yield” sorts of things.
1:16:58
Well, forest products research still seems to keep going, but Congressional
1:17:06
hearings sometimes get around to the point of, “How come we’re putting up money
1:17:13
for something the companies do?” Well, there were several arguments for that.
1:17:20
I don’t know what studies are germane today but they still use that, “Well, it’s
1:17:25
about the small companies that just can’t afford research,” and that sort of thing.
1:17:31
Good to favor of some of these new programs.
1:17:38
Alternative ways of doing
1:17:43
things.
1:17:47
That’s the only thing I’ve been really drawn into, is trying to
1:17:56
say that some of this is passé, and the money should be going into
1:18:03
more programs like Bernard Bormann’s and things of that sort.
1:18:13
In your field of soil research, Bernard Bormann is one person
1:18:18
you mention quite a bit.
1:18:25
But, you mentioned earlier that you hired Fred Swanson, is that right?
1:18:31
If we could back up a little bit and talk about
1:18:37
what qualities about Fred attracted you to hiring him?
1:18:41
Well, I didn’t have the direct hiring
1:18:55
authority.
1:18:55
Once in a great while someone would come directly to me and
1:19:03
lay it out.
1:19:04
These were usually people who knew who they were, and they fill out the
1:19:12
papers and put in the applications, but they knew how to get things done.
1:19:23
Fred was recommended to me.
1:19:30
We asked around, and he fit a slot very well that
1:19:43
we wanted to fill.
1:19:43
If you can tell me, who recommended him to you?
1:19:45
No, I can’t remember that.
1:19:49
I can’t remember those details.
1:19:52
But, by that time we were having enough budget troubles that
1:20:00
every hire had to be looked at pretty hard.
1:20:10
You always wanted to have at least one piece of money somewhere, so
1:20:18
that if a really well qualified person came along, you could act.
1:20:21
Like Bernard Bormann,
1:20:29
a guy who did wonderful things in Alaska and the Forest Service probably has paid
1:20:34
attention to what he found up there.
1:20:39
A real example of a well-trained person, analyzing and showing
1:20:49
a problem and solving it.
1:20:54
And Fred had the background,
1:21:01
so I thought of those as kind of special hires that were direct interventions.
1:21:07
Jim
1:21:11
Sedell was another one, he was at Weyerhaeuser.
1:21:26
There weren’t many, but you were well paid off if you had somebody that really
1:21:31
stood head and shoulders above the rest.
1:21:34
Somebody mentioned this to me and it kind of struck a chord, because I was an
1:21:43
undergraduate at that time, looking for work, and there was a hiring freeze on.
1:21:48
Fred was hired during a freeze.
1:21:50
So, what you’re saying is
1:21:55
it was just, there was what you call a need for someone with his qualifications,
1:21:57
and that there was a policy, or your approach to things was to make sure
1:22:03
that, if that kind of person became available, that there was some way
1:22:06
of getting them into the station?
1:22:08
Yeah.
1:22:10
Got a grandson right now that’s been working on temporary [employment status]
1:22:15
since graduation at the Forest Service.
1:22:20
Nine months a year
1:22:24
job with no benefits.
1:22:25
Of
1:22:27
course, the agency is trying to meet their target by year 2000, to have
1:22:33
a majority of women and minorities.
1:22:38
He’s a wonderful woodsmen,
1:22:41
hardworking serious kid,
1:22:45
just the same as, and with the cutbacks on people, women’s rights and other
1:22:49
factors, makes it hard to find a job.
1:22:52
But, there was a few people you couldn’t pass up.
1:22:58
I would say that
1:23:03
I felt that was entirely justified, because
1:23:08
they only come around once.
1:23:10
When Fred came in, did you have any expectation at that time that he
1:23:13
would be going into leadership of the Andrews group in the future?
1:23:17
No, I didn’t.
1:23:21
He was capable.
1:23:23
The
1:23:25
Andrews group, another nice thing about it as far as I recall, that was
1:23:30
something you didn’t have to worry about.
1:23:34
Of course, you did a little worrying about
1:23:41
the outside money, but
1:23:48
you weren’t given any problems with these people.
1:23:49
They were all
1:23:55
sincere and eager to go and
1:24:00
everything.
1:24:01
I recall that as one of the nice areas that I didn’t have
1:24:05
to do much worrying about.
1:24:07
Would you compare the Andrews Experimental Forest
1:24:13
with Wind River, Cascade Head, and Bonanza Creek.
1:24:17
Was administration of the Andrews a different kind of responsibility
1:24:20
than some of those ones, or, were the other ones as self-directed,
1:24:24
as it sounds like the Andrews was?
1:24:28
Bonanza Creek was new enough and near enough the one unit up there, and
1:24:38
it
1:24:40
was selected for its adaptability to the kind of work that was supposed to
1:24:45
be done, so that unit was set up well.
1:24:49
Cascade Head was set up as a research
1:24:58
headquarters for Sitka spruce-hemlock forests.
1:25:04
It was one of the earlier ones, and they made quite an investment
1:25:07
in the house and buildings and
1:25:11
putting somebody there, but
1:25:16
it never enjoyed a great amount of use, except when they had tests of
1:25:25
skyline logging systems down there.
1:25:28
And that was a time when the industry got a lot of Sitka
1:25:35
spruce trees and we got some
1:25:40
research ideas.
1:25:40
So,
1:25:51
it never attracted lots of people.
1:25:54
I had studies down there.
1:25:56
Most of the time I worked
1:26:02
there, weren’t many others there.
1:26:03
It was kind of the same thing in each of the old experiments, that in the first
1:26:08
days there was a lot of stuff put in,
1:26:13
some of which turned out to be really valuable, but the
1:26:20
techniques of designing good studies were not
1:26:28
really paramount in the “old, old days.” There
1:26:38
were lots of side-by-side comparisons, and few replications.
1:26:44
So, much of that older work,
1:26:49
at the time,
1:26:53
might of given some ideas, but I don’t recall any great practices.
1:26:59
How
1:27:05
would you talk about the success of the Andrews?
1:27:09
As a long-term program that is, and as the station director.
1:27:16
Well, it’s certainly a different world with a
1:27:23
much more mature approach to research.
1:27:28
We certainly have the facilities now that nobody has ever had before,
1:27:33
as long as you keep people that are
1:27:43
into it.
1:27:45
What’s that one study, 200 years, 300 years,
1:27:54
something [chuckle] like that?
1:27:54
That’s right.
1:27:54
Gabe Tucker is putting in a long-term
1:28:03
experiment now with
1:28:06
different simulations, how to reconstruct or simulate old growth type
1:28:12
forests, over a long period of time.
1:28:16
It’s a phenomenal idea.
1:28:17
I think one measure perhaps of the fact that people are these days
1:28:23
much more comfortable with research than they used to be, is that I have
1:28:28
never heard anybody snicker or laugh about the idea of thinking you can
1:28:33
put in a study for 100 or 200 years.
1:28:37
You’d have been laughed out of the room [in previous era] , “Who’s
1:28:42
gonna make the last measurement?”
1:28:47
And maybe the value of that study is that that will give some continuity
1:28:50
to that operation. I don’t know, I hope humanity lasts that long.
1:28:58
Well, I’m curious, you’ve been involved with this for a while.
1:29:02
What
1:29:05
changed that attitude about long-term studies, and where does that leave us
1:29:10
in terms of the ability to complete a long-term study or continue it?
1:29:14
There’s a number
1:29:17
of possible areas you might think about.
1:29:20
Funding sources which
1:29:24
might be involved, just the fact that we’ve been out here
1:29:28
in the Northwest longer now.
1:29:29
The Pacific Northwest Station has been here for pretty close to 80
1:29:34
years now, 70 years, I guess”?
1:29:37
Well, I think it’s just betting on the word that the guy’s got an interest and
1:29:44
we’ll put ‘er in, and I’ll do all I can to see that it keeps going, including
1:29:50
making sure somebody is coming behind me.
1:29:55
Just individuals working there and bringing other people in with them?
1:29:58
Yeah.
1:30:03
Quite a concept.
1:30:07
Do you have recommendations on
1:30:13
things that
1:30:20
you think a study like this should really look into, in the
1:30:23
context of Andrews and the last
1:30:34
50 years?
1:30:35
Chris Foster and I have talked about the ways in which the Andrews
1:30:40
grew and found an avenue for taking their work off the Andrews, and
1:30:45
connecting with other sites or groups.
1:30:49
And one of the ones that he’s pointed out here is the Mount St. Helens study,
1:30:52
which I guess came right about the end of your period in the directorship up
1:30:57
there, trying to get recollection of that.
1:31:02
Well, I was down here by that time, but
1:31:10
it interested me that the people that turned around and watched
1:31:14
St. Helens, were the same group.
1:31:18
Which was really the one group in the Northwest capable of doing all that.
1:31:27
There were people from the University of Washington and other places, but here was
1:31:30
a group of people, who, well everybody was ecstatic with this opportunity, what
1:31:39
a wonderful thing [study post-eruption dynamics] . Here we are trying to
1:31:46
look at something after the fact, at
1:31:50
the Andrews, and here, we get a chance to start from day one?
1:31:58
Gosh, there’s no way they could have done a study at the Andrews that
1:32:05
would be as good as this area to see something start, from right after
1:32:11
the big bang, and to watch it grow.
1:32:15
About the
1:32:21
enthusiasm, it was the same kind of thing at the Andrews, but I think I heard more
1:32:26
enthusiasm about the St. Helens stuff.
1:32:30
It turned people on, and it was a great opportunity,
1:32:35
like a lot of things were.
1:32:39
I think they all could see the application of exactly what
1:32:42
they were doing at the Andrews.
1:32:43
That there was a moment of opportunity that they
1:32:53
didn’t miss a beat in taking advantage of it.
1:32:57
It sounds like what you’re saying is that by the time of that event, the
1:33:02
Andrews group had already established a
1:33:06
presence in the research community that people thought of them as being
1:33:09
the people that were set for it?
1:33:10
[Prepared scientifically and logistically to study Mount.
1:33:10
St. Helens eruption/recovery processes.]
1:33:10
Yeah.
1:33:12
Do you attribute that to IBP?
1:33:21
IBP gave the opportunity,
1:33:27
and it so happened we had enough people with the ability to take advantage of it.
1:33:36
That’s probably the first generation of that kind of people,
1:33:43
and enough time had gone by
1:33:47
for that first generation that they could have done
1:33:56
that [Study complex post-disturbance dynamics at high level] . They’d
1:33:57
essentially done a lot of research out here as far as biology.
1:34:01
Those of us that
1:34:06
came in right after the war, you started out and by-and-large,
1:34:12
you did the easy things, because there was a nice place to start.
1:34:14
You had to start and pick away at
1:34:19
getting some things done.
1:34:21
There was a group that this
1:34:26
IBP caught at
1:34:30
the time, probably serendipity, that ten years before you wouldn’t
1:34:36
have had these people, maybe.
1:34:39
Then, ten years after that you had a group all ready to go that could
1:34:44
respond to the St. Helens thing.
1:34:48
I’d never really thought about that, but that looks pretty clear to
1:34:53
me.
1:34:53
That is
1:34:58
the first time we could could have mustered that many capable scientists who
1:35:05
were really focused deeply, and said, “St.
1:35:12
Helens is neat, and let’s run up there and take care of that.”
1:35:18
[Intensive studies first 5-10 years, tapered back after that.]
1:35:19
You mentioned the last time I was here, you were talking about the concept
1:35:21
of getting a critical mass of people together in one location to do quality
1:35:25
research, and that at some point you split them up into different locations.
1:35:32
Probably what you’re saying is that enough people had come together since 1979 at
1:35:35
the Andrews, to be a really powerful unit.
1:35:36
Yeah.
1:35:36
Well, at
1:35:39
Andrews we had that many people that could do the job.
1:35:45
And I’d never thought of that, but that’s kind of a wonderful thing.
1:35:53
What do you think led to those people focusing out of that one
1:35:58
location, what attracts that kind of person to that kind of location?
1:36:03
You mean?
1:36:04
The Andrews is what I’m talking about in this case.
1:36:08
So, that by the time the St. Helens event occurs, you have
1:36:12
this critical mass of people.
1:36:13
I think the Andrews was
1:36:21
the best and closest
1:36:25
of any of the Forest Service experimental forests.
1:36:28
And the Forest Service was the only one [agency] that had big
1:36:33
areas in experimental forests.
1:36:37
The Andrews was the closest one of the forests to Oregon State.
1:36:46
I don’t think I remember ever of anybody doing research for
1:36:52
Oregon State up at the Wind River.
1:36:56
The
1:37:00
other side of the Columbia River, and they are having the ceremony to note
1:37:06
the passing of the Wind River Nursery.
1:37:10
It must be that they can get seedlings cheaper than they can grow them up there.
1:37:16
And that’s another interesting thing.
1:37:20
One of the other things I did for a few years was work on regeneration problems.
1:37:31
I observed that they were planting green seedlings in winter.
1:37:40
They’d be green up into May, but the first couple of dry days,
1:37:47
many times they’d call in and say, “We got a problem – an epidemic.
1:37:51
They’re all dying off!” But you could go around the edge of a clear-cut
1:37:56
and dig up natural seedlings that had long, succulent roots with great big,
1:38:01
long, white things on the end of them.
1:38:04
So, obviously,
1:38:09
I was able to get them to do some different things at the nursery.
1:38:15
They cold-stored these things all winter in bales, and they would get mold on them.
1:38:21
One pathologists at the station told them that they should wait till they get the
1:38:31
below-freezing days up there in the [Columbia River] Gorge, and the
1:38:35
sun was out, a clear cold day, and open all the doors and the whole
1:38:41
works, get some fresh air in there.
1:38:45
[Laughter]
1:38:46
Some concept, huh?
1:38:47
[Laughter]
1:38:47
[Laughter] They were planning.
1:38:49
That
1:38:52
was somewhat pragmatic.
1:38:55
Where were we?
1:38:57
Actually, we were talking about your trips out to the
1:39:00
Andrews and why they were there.
1:39:04
Well, I think it was that we had people from the station
1:39:08
who were working down there.
1:39:16
I can’t remember any Oregon State people actually doing anything
1:39:21
down there before that time.
1:39:24
But when this thing came along, somebody down there got together and
1:39:28
suggested, and I don’t know who that was.
1:39:32
That’s why I think Dick Waring would be a good lead for you.
1:39:35
Is he here in town?
1:39:40
Yeah,
1:39:44
he’s gone quite a bit.
1:39:46
He’s
1:39:48
much in demand.
1:39:54
I always daydream about picking the big “dream team” out of
1:40:02
the two organizations [US
1:40:19
Forest Service and OSU] , and he’d be one.
1:40:22
Dick Waring, Professor of Forest Science.
1:40:26
What is he?
1:40:26
He was
1:40:29
awarded the
1:40:32
Distinguished Professor award a year
1:40:37
or two ago.
1:40:37
Dick did some real fine physiology work.
1:40:44
As I
1:40:50
was saying I don’t want to use up your whole afternoon, I’ve spent a couple
1:40:53
hours already, it’s wearing I know.
1:40:57
If something does occur to you,
1:41:01
you’re welcome to let me
1:41:15
know.
1:41:15
Okay.
1:41:16
I
1:41:21
would like to get up to speed on what you’re doing.
