00:01
You were at the Andrews and talking a little bit about how you worked at the
00:11
Andrews since being a graduate student.
00:11
I thought maybe we could start out a little bit before that
00:11
actually, and describe a little bit about your background and
00:11
academic path to the Andrews.
00:11
Did you work in
00:45
forestry?
00:55
Why the Northwest?
00:56
Why the
01:00
Andrews?
01:00
Why do you work here?
01:01
I actually started working for the Andrews as an undergraduate.
01:07
I was a forestry student over in Peavy [Hall] , here.
01:16
I had come to get into forestry and be in the Northwest.
01:21
Well, I came to OSU specifically to go into forestry, and OSU is
01:28
known to be a very good forestry school, and so I ended up here.
01:33
I had started my undergraduate at the University of Arizona because
01:38
I was working in biochemistry, actually, at that time.
01:42
I had a high school job working in a biochemistry laboratory and the job
01:48
took me, after graduation from high school, to the University of Arizona.
01:52
And I was working in biochemistry, but what I really wanted to do was
01:55
to go into forestry, because it had a lot to do with natural history.
02:01
As a child, because of my sixth-grade science teacher, I was always
02:06
interested in natural history.
02:10
Among the fields of natural history,
02:14
the one that I thought would be most applicable to my interests was forestry,
02:21
so I decided to go into forestry when I was still in high school.
02:25
Where did you go to high school?
02:26
A place called Germantown Friends near Philadelphia.
02:30
I grew up there.
02:31
It was a Quaker high school and I was interested in natural history, but
02:36
it had to be something professional.
02:38
I had to find some kind of profession.
02:41
At
02:44
a young age, the one that I identified with was a forest ranger, so I
02:53
decided to go to forestry school.
02:55
I ended up at the University of Arizona, because the person I was working with
03:01
in Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania, took a position at the
03:04
University of Arizona and he asked me to come out and train his new technician in
03:09
a technique I had developed in his lab.
03:11
So, I was out in Arizona and did a semester there, but the forestry
03:16
program there was nonexistent, so I transferred quite quickly to
03:24
OSU.
03:25
At that time there was no Department of Forest Science,
03:30
only a Department of Forest Management that had a forest science option.
03:37
There was an undergraduate curriculum in forest science that
03:40
kind of augmented the normal forest management track for an undergraduate.
03:47
But there was no department of forest science per se, which is a main part
03:53
of OSU that now works on the Andrews.
03:59
So, I
04:04
really got into it as an undergraduate, and you’re required at OSU to take
04:09
two summers of work within forestry.
04:14
Most forestry schools have a summer camp where you go and live together,
04:21
and OSU is adjacent to McDonald Forest, so there is no need for summer camp.
04:25
But you do have to work within the industry.
04:29
I kind of blew off the first summer painting houses, I only had two summers
04:34
left in my undergraduate career, so I had to spend both of them working in forestry.
04:40
I spoke to my advisor, Bill Ferrell, who is still quite active in LTER.
04:45
He was my undergraduate advisor, and he was also, Jerry
04:49
Franklin’s master’s advisor.
04:53
Anyway, Bill
04:56
Ferrell knew I needed a job, and he took my resume and sent it over to
05:06
Chuck Grier who was working on the IBP program, International Biological Program.
05:13
He was over in the Forest Research Lab and worked very closely with Dick Waring and
05:17
Jerry Franklin and others who were heading up what was then a major research project.
05:22
I’m sure you’ve heard about that.
05:28
He got my resume and I went over for an interview.
05:35
I came for the interview and sat down, I don’t know if
05:40
I’ve told you this story.
05:40
It’s kind of a funny story.
05:42
Grier
05:47
sat up there, rocking back-and-forth in his chair, reading my resume,
05:52
and it was dead silence for 15 minutes or more as he sat and read
05:57
my resume and thought about it.
05:58
I was getting pretty nervous, you know.
06:00
I really wanted this job bad.
06:02
I had to get a job in forestry, and doing research was exactly what I wanted to do.
06:07
I had other research experience, but it wasn’t in forestry.
06:11
Finally, he looked up from my resume, looked at me and said, “Well, it
06:15
looks like you are qualified, but do you fly fish?” Totally flabbergasted,
06:20
I said, “No, I don’t fly fish, but I can learn fast.” [Chuckles]
06:28
I really wanted this job.
06:29
And so, Grier said, “Well, it turns out the guy you will be working
06:31
for, he doesn’t want any turkeys.
06:33
You have to be a fly fisherman to take this job.”
06:38
And I said, “Okay, I will learn fly fishing.”
06:42
He
06:48
was actually hiring people to work with this guy named Steve Running.
06:54
Steve Running was Dick Waring’s technician.
07:00
He had done his masters at OSU and was now a technician.
07:01
I think
07:08
he did his masters with Dick Waring.
07:11
No, Dick Walker over in Botany, and he was a technician for Waring.
07:19
Running had several research sites inside the Andrews, and ones outside the Andrews
07:26
located near deep fly fishing holes.
07:30
His strategy was you had to work a very long day doing water relations, which is
07:34
the study of plant physiology, the water relation of plants in regard to plant
07:43
physiology, and you had to start pre-dawn.
07:45
At 3:00 in the morning, you had to be up and measuring plants.
07:48
You do what they call pre-dawn moisture stress.
07:53
You had to start pre-dawn, get a sample from the plants and put it in
07:59
this pressure bomb, and test it before the sun rose, because then the plant
08:03
moisture system changed as the sun rose.
08:05
You had to get the conditions, and then every two hours throughout the
08:10
day, you would use a parameter and measure the transpiration of the plant.
08:16
But that only took like 10 to 15 minutes, so for like an hour and 45 minutes,
08:23
you, basically, had nothing to do.
08:25
Except you had to start at 3:00 in the morning and go to 10:00 at night.
08:28
You
08:31
work like 10 or 15 minutes every two hours for almost all the day.
08:39
So, the fly fishing fits in-between.
08:41
Yeah, so the fly fishing fits in-between.
08:43
We couldn’t do it at the Andrews, of course [it was closed to fishing]
08:44
, but there were sites outside of the Andrews that involved IBP.
08:49
He was leery about
08:52
getting a “turkey” [technician who couldn’t fly fish] , so the
08:55
first day at work, he sat me down.
08:59
Steve Running was very serious about this, and he said, “Okay, you get out
09:02
a piece of paper and pencil, and we are going to make a list of the equipment
09:06
you’re going to buy and bring back, and don’t come back to work without it.” And
09:13
it was a rod, cougar, reel, you know, a forward-weighted
09:20
fly-fishing line, so much lead.
09:22
So,
09:28
I just listened and went down to Anderson Sporting Goods, bought
09:35
this stuff, and came to work.
09:39
Technical equipment.
09:41
But that point aside, the work was really serious and they took it very
09:47
seriously, but at the same time they needed to get through the day, and this
09:52
was the way Steve Running ran things.
09:55
When was this?
09:56
This was 1974, the summer of 1974.
10:00
You came
10:08
here in 1972?
10:12
I came in ‘72 and I did four years here, fall of ‘72 to spring of
10:18
‘76.
10:18
Starting in June of ’74, I worked at the Andrews with the IBP program,
10:24
and my junior and senior year,
10:30
I worked during the school year as well.
10:33
They kept me employed during the school year.
10:36
I worked part time through the school year, my junior and senior year.
10:42
A lot of it was water relations, because that is what Steve Running and Dick
10:50
Waring were working on, and that was a big part of the modeling that was going on.
10:55
IBP was developing simulation models, and a lot of the simulation models
11:00
had to do with plant moisture stress.
11:02
That was a real driving factor; the physiological state of the plants and how
11:10
they would photosynthesize, whether or not their stomates were open or closed.
11:15
The stomates open when they have plenty of water, and therefore, photosynthesize.
11:20
That, in return, impacts productivity of the ecosystem.
11:24
How much primary, how much carbon was being fixed, and therefore, the
11:27
net primary productivity increases.
11:35
Running was a very jovial guy, but at the same time, he took his work
11:40
incredibly seriously, and I don’t think people ever realized how serious
11:44
of a scientist Steve Running was
11:49
all this time.
11:50
When he went from the IBP program into a Ph.D. program, and now is
11:55
at the University of Montana and really a world-class scientist,
11:58
he just totally stunned everyone.
12:01
I think the IBP program and Andrews’ program was kind of a ferment which
12:11
inspired a lot of his intellectual development in ways that people never
12:15
imagined, that this joker would go off and become the scientist that he is today.
12:21
While he was here, he was a technician?
12:23
Right, while here, he was a technician.
12:28
He wrote a paper with Chuck Grier, and several with Dick Warring, but people
12:33
always saw him as Dick Waring’s assistant.
12:37
They never suspected him in his own right as a scientist.
12:40
But he was developing his own ideas and coming into his own, unbeknownst
12:47
to many scientists around him.
12:50
He went to Colorado State [where he worked] , with a guy named Ken Reed,
12:56
did his Ph.D., and went on to the University of Montana.
13:01
Now,
13:04
he gets literally millions of dollars in grants and has a whole
13:08
platoon of graduate students.
13:09
He apparently made quite an impression on you, beyond fly fishing.
13:14
Yeah.
13:23
I also met Bill Emmingham, who is now here
13:29
at OSU, and
13:33
also Chuck Grier and Dick Waring, but it was really Emmingham and
13:38
Running I worked the closest with.
13:41
I was able to do
13:53
an undergraduate thesis at the Andrews, and nobody else I know has
13:54
done an undergraduate thesis at OSU, although it is in the catalogue.
13:57
You look at the schedule of classes it’s always there, undergraduate thesis.
14:02
When I saw it I said, “Well, I’m going to try that,” and I had some ideas.
14:06
We were doing pressure bomb measurements and plant moisture stress measurements at
14:09
a place called the Hi-15 in the Andrews.
14:11
You may be familiar with it; it is Watersheds 6, 7 and 8.
14:12
Watersheds 6 and 7 were
14:16
just being harvested at that time in the mid- ‘70’s.
14:20
In fact, I think they were cut in
14:28
‘75, ‘76, something like that.
14:33
We were doing pressure bomb measurements on smaller trees, and I
14:36
was interested in the development of the trees following clear-cutting.
14:42
How are these trees going to respond not only from a plant moisture
14:45
stress point of view, but also from a leaf morphology point of view?
14:48
How are they going to deal with the large amount of incoming sunlight,
14:52
when they had been dealing with a very shady environment all
15:01
their lives?
15:02
We collected samples, I sectioned the samples and looked at the
15:06
development of the leaves, and wrote this up as an undergraduate thesis.
15:16
Not only the IBP program, but the Andrews
15:21
research enabled that and really started me.
15:26
That was the first paper I ever wrote in the forestry literature.
15:32
You came in with quite a little bit of technical expertise for
15:35
someone who was an undergraduate.
15:35
Did you see that as common with
15:39
the people you were working with?
15:42
Not really, no.
15:44
I
15:48
had worked as a high school student in a laboratory and I didn’t know
15:53
of anybody else that had done
15:57
that.
15:57
That didn’t captivate me as much.
15:59
I kind of wanted to do my own thing.
16:01
My father had worked in medicine and biochemistry.
16:04
I had wanted to do science, but a different kind of science,
16:08
and this was the science
16:12
that I wanted to do.
16:13
The Andrews and the IBP program created the environment that
16:18
allowed me to really do that.
16:22
That undergraduate thesis Bill Emmingham and I later published, got me into
16:27
a master’s program at University of Washington, and then, got me into a Ph.
16:32
D. program at Cornell.
16:33
It was that start that really kind of got me going in my career.
16:39
I really credit it to the people, the IBP program and
16:46
the Andrews, where it happened.
16:46
Have you ever regretted your decision to come up here, or were
16:51
you attracted in by Oregon State’s reputation or the forestry complex?
16:53
Had you any other options at that point?
16:59
No.
17:02
When I went to Arizona, I had applied to other places.
17:07
But, when I came here I decided that I wanted to go to OSU and
17:12
I didn’t apply to anywhere else.
17:16
I didn’t know about the Andrews at that time,
17:20
so it wasn’t until I got here that I really found out about it.
17:25
You talked a little bit about your first impressions working here
17:26
with Grier early in the interview.
17:27
What were
17:30
your first impressions of the site when you began to work there?
17:35
Well, there were no buildings.
17:37
I think maybe the warehouse was there, but we never went in the warehouse.
17:42
Actually, we went to the weather station there near the warehouse.
17:46
That was there in the early ‘70’s, and I think maybe the warehouse
17:51
was there, but no other buildings.
17:54
The road stopped at that warehouse you see on the immediate right as
17:57
you drive into the headquarters site.
18:00
There weren’t trailers.
18:01
There wasn’t anything.
18:02
There was nothing on the Andrews.
18:07
There were trailers outside the Andrews.
18:10
There was one down at Blue River, and there was one over at Rainbow.
18:15
That’s why the fisheries unit
18:19
now at the Andrews is called Rainbow, because Rainbow was originally a trailer
18:24
in the Rainbow trailer park in the town of Rainbow on the McKenzie, where
18:29
the covered bridge is located, a very scenic little town called Rainbow.
18:35
It’s called Rainbow because there was a trailer that housed the fishery people
18:39
in the town of Rainbow that was part of the IBP program, but at that time
18:43
there were no facilities.
18:45
My first memories of the Andrews were that weather station, and
18:50
then, or course, Watershed 10.
18:52
Watershed 10 was where everything happened, because it related to IBP.
18:57
You had to do a replica of your research on Watershed 10.
19:03
You may have research sites elsewhere, but you also did that kind of
19:08
data collection on Watershed 10.
19:13
Watershed 10 was cut at about that time, I think in ‘75 or
19:16
something.
19:17
You would know better than I.
19:21
But we did some data collection in Watershed 10, I believe,
19:25
before it was cut, and
19:31
did these pre-dawn measurements.
19:33
A lot of data I collected, I didn’t see where I was, because
19:37
we were doing it pre-dawn.
19:39
Once a month I think it was, we had to drive around the Andrews.
19:43
We started at like one in the morning, and would drive around the entire
19:47
Andrews to different sites where we would quickly do plant moisture stress
19:52
measurements using a pressure bomb.
19:54
It was quite difficult because we were often measuring very large
19:59
trees, like old-growth trees.
20:00
The way to do it was to use a shotgun, blow a branch out of the tree, then
20:08
take the branch and stick it in this pressure bomb, apply pressure and measure
20:13
the plant moisture stress of the plant.
20:16
In very quick order, we had to start at one in the morning, and
20:19
by the time sunrise is coming, we had to reach the last of 10 or
20:24
15 sites all around the Andrews.
20:29
They were recording temperature, soil temperature and air temperature,
20:33
at all these sites, as well.
20:34
And they were what we call reference stands.
20:37
You’ve heard of reference stands?
20:39
Once a month during the program, the reference stands were measured
20:42
for plant moisture stress.
20:44
So, that’s another early memory.
20:47
I mean, you had to have a good sense of humor
20:55
to drag yourself up at one in the morning and to go through that.
21:01
So, there was a lot of camaraderie.
21:09
Were there other undergraduates working there?
21:10
Not that many.
21:11
Actually,
21:14
there were a few.
21:16
It was interesting.
21:17
I wanted to mix with them, get to know them, but a lot of them stayed
21:24
down at a place called Gypsy Camp.
21:29
It was where all the hippie, quote, unquote folks, hung out.
21:35
“Gypsy Camp” is kind a youthism, or hippyism, what they came up with for
21:44
the name of a place.
21:46
At that time, that was the only place that anybody stayed on the Andrews, and where
21:52
any large number of people camped out.
21:54
In a sense, Gypsy Camp was the first headquarters.
21:59
Running didn’t like Gypsy Camp.
22:01
I always wanted to stay there, and he would never go anywhere near it.
22:04
That’s just the way Steve Running was.
22:08
So, we never stayed at Gypsy Camp, and I never really got to
22:11
hang out with my peers, fellow technicians or assistant technicians.
22:16
Just worked pretty closely with Steve?
22:17
I worked very closely with Running and that’s why he was so intent
22:22
on getting somebody who wasn’t a “turkey.” To him, if you were a
22:26
fly fisherman, then it was okay.
22:28
You probably weren’t a hippie?
22:29
Well, I don’t
22:34
know.
22:35
Because, obviously, I had to work very closely with this guy.
22:38
I mean, we were camping out the whole summer in different places,
22:42
and getting up at odd hours and doing
22:47
these measurements.
22:48
It was important that we get along, so he figured a big part
22:50
of getting along was fly fishing.
22:53
Did you get good at that?
22:54
I never got really good at that, but I really enjoyed it.
22:58
I still do a bit of it with
23:04
Al Levno, who’s kind of the resident expert.
23:06
The last time I went fishing was with Al Levno.
23:11
What was your impression of Andrews’ people interacting with people at
23:13
established communities, like at Blue River or the upper McKenzie area?
23:13
Well, it was different at that time.
23:22
There were
23:39
a lot more scientists around during the IBP program, and because
23:46
there wasn’t a headquarters where everybody went and stayed, people
23:49
interacted more with the community.
23:51
We went to the Whitewater Cafe for breakfast, and
23:57
we often had dinner there.
23:58
And the Blue River Tavern was open and running as a tavern, so we would go
24:04
there in the evening and have a beer.
24:08
We didn’t interact a whole lot with the loggers, but there was a lot
24:12
of logging going on at that time.
24:15
So, it was a different, a very different relationship.
24:18
Now that there is a headquarters, we all kind of go there and hang out there,
24:21
and don’t mix much with the community.
24:23
But at that time, we were living in trailers and mostly eating at restaurants,
24:29
so I think that there probably was more interaction with the community, because
24:36
there was a lot more logging going on and more of a vibrant community.
24:42
Blue River is a ghost town now compared to what it was twenty
24:46
years ago, when logging was really
24:51
booming.
24:54
The
24:56
level of interaction was pretty much focused on people coming up there to
25:00
see what kind of work was going on?
25:02
No.
25:04
The
25:07
interpretive aspects of the Andrews are really very recent.
25:11
There was no old-growth trail, no interpretive kiosk, and
25:17
we didn’t have
25:20
groups of undergraduates coming to study like we have now.
25:26
So, there was a lot less of that type of interaction with the forest.
25:34
Any interactions we had was afterhours with the local community,
25:39
and it was much less formal.
25:42
It was strictly during the summer that you were up there?
25:46
Right.
25:46
Yeah, this is when I worked up there in the summer and then we
25:50
would collect data and bring data and samples down to the [FSL] here.
25:55
And there were people like Art McKee and others who were up there year around
26:02
and graduate students, but at that time I was an undergraduate, so I was doing
26:08
classes and stuff during the school year.
26:12
Do you have perceptions of the interaction or connections between
26:20
scientists working up there
26:24
and people working with the ranger district?
26:28
I didn’t personally at that time, although a lot of interaction had to do with the
26:34
fairly close connection because of the logging of Watershed 10, and then of the
26:40
Hi-15 watersheds, which took place in the
26:45
early to mid ‘70’s.
26:46
But, I didn’t personally have a lot of interaction with them, although I’m sure
26:53
Art [McKee] could probably tell you a lot
26:56
more about that.
26:57
I was just curious, was there any kind of orientation to working at the Andrews
27:01
at the time you started working there?
27:01
Were people oriented to the philosophy of the place?
27:02
Oh no.
27:02
A bunch of fishing equipment and that was it?
27:02
Well, when you work with
27:13
Steve Running, yeah.
27:14
How do you spell his name by the way?
27:16
R-U-N-N-I-N-G.
27:17
Okay.
27:20
That is what I had.
27:20
He’s now at the University of Montana.
27:23
You could call him and he would give you an ear full.
27:26
How long was he there, do you know?
27:27
How long was he at the Andrews?
27:29
Yeah.
27:29
Working up there fishing.
27:33
At least five years, I think.
27:40
I can’t remember when he went and did his Ph.D. He was thinking about doing
27:47
his Ph.D. He might have actually worked on his masters connected to the Andrews.
27:51
I can’t remember.
27:55
But it was really remarkable what happened to him.
28:01
I will never forget once when
28:10
Running related to Chuck Grier that he was thinking about getting a Ph.D., and
28:17
Grier said, “You’re going to get a Ph.D.?” You know,
28:23
like, “Why don’t you just be Waring’s assistant?” Running said,
28:27
“I’m not going to be Waring’s assistant for the rest of my life.
28:32
I’m going to be a scientist in my own right.” Essentially,
28:35
that is what he was saying.
28:39
Nobody ever expected that he would turn into the world-class
28:42
scientist that he has.
28:44
He’s every bit as much a world-class scientist as Dick
28:50
Waring, who he had worked for.
28:52
I mean, NASA and
28:56
NSF are showering him with all kinds of research grants at this point, and he’s
29:04
incredibly successful in his own right.
29:07
There was a paper that he, and I think he and Waring and Grier put together,
29:15
that kind of got him going into
29:24
large-scale, ecosystem modeling.
29:27
Looking at the large-scale ecosystems, which is what he does now, really,
29:29
from remote sensing and modeling.
29:33
A lot of that started at the Andrews, and the simulation modeling and
29:39
what not that was going in there.
29:44
Your perception of that time,
29:49
that a student in the process of becoming a scientist, would be unusual among the
29:50
Andrews’ people working as technicians?
30:04
It’s hard to say.
30:13
I think in many ways, the Andrews created
30:19
a real ferment that allowed people to think a lot and develop ideas, so that it
30:30
gave people opportunities they wouldn’t have had otherwise.
30:33
I don’t know if Steve Running, for example, would have gone on, or if
30:36
I would have gone on to a Ph.D., had not it not been for that, but it
30:37
certainly was crucial to our situations.
30:37
Does it stick out in your mind, mainly because you worked
30:37
closely with him, not because he
30:48
was an exception to the rule?
30:49
No.
30:52
It was because people underestimated him and
30:58
he did go on to great things.
31:00
I think a lot of that had to do with his experience at the Andrews and IBP program.
31:10
Another person was Henry Gholz, who was a graduate student at the
31:14
time, and is now a professor at University of Florida at Gainesville.
31:20
Henry Gholz.
31:21
Gholz.
31:21
G-H-O-L-Z.
31:22
He
31:26
started out doing a master’s program with Waring then they quickly eliminated
31:31
the master’s and turned it into a Ph.D.
31:35
He did really great stuff and now has gone on.
31:40
He
31:47
really benefited from that whole scene.
31:50
And it’s hard to say, what was going on.
31:53
In many ways it was much different than it is now.
31:55
During the IBP program, there was
32:00
no
32:03
facility, so that wasn’t the focus.
32:05
Right now the focus that brings people together, is kind of the facilities
32:08
that are there, and everybody kind of staying in those buildings.
32:14
But then, there wasn’t that, but there was this unifying research
32:19
program in the IBP, which in many ways was much more unifying than LTER.
32:26
It was a very short burst of energy, a short infusion of money they knew
32:32
wasn’t going to last a long time.
32:33
It wasn’t long-term, it was very short-term, but
32:39
it was a kind of funding that forestry research had not seen
32:40
and never expected to see again, so they were making use of it.
32:47
That really pulled people together,
32:51
and made them think not only of their own work, but how they could
32:54
develop simulation models to pull in the work of other people as well.
32:58
And it
33:03
had a certain camaraderie and
33:08
an atmosphere that I haven’t seen in research since,
33:14
and which is really different from the LTER program, which is much
33:18
more entrenched in the long haul.
33:25
Sounds like it was almost a different mission,
33:30
a different sense of mission and lifestyle?
33:32
Well.
33:32
Was there a different kind of dynamic there?
33:37
I was curious if there were any particular problems that came
33:42
up when you were out there.
33:44
One that struck me, driving around at night on the roads at the Andrews, was
33:49
you either got to know the roads really
33:55
well, or you were just lucky.
33:56
Which was it?
33:56
There was also a lot more logging going on, so the roads were better maintained.
34:01
Right now, the roads are much more dangerous than they were then, because
34:06
road maintenance is dependent on logging.
34:09
And there is very little, if any logging going on, so the roads aren’t graveled
34:13
and they don’t brush the sides of them.
34:19
The use of the shotgun kind of had me concerned, as I didn’t
34:24
come from a background of hunting and fishing for that matter.
34:29
You’re dealing with this shotgun and it was a little spooky, but
34:34
we got used to it and nobody was hurt, and the most important thing
34:37
you had to remember was one person.
34:39
There was a fellow named Glenn Hawk who worked there, and Hawk had tried out a
34:45
technique with the shotgun where he would lie flat on his back and hold the shotgun,
34:50
because, you had to steady yourself.
34:53
He wanted to try a new technique, so he would lie flat on his back
34:58
on the forest floor and hold the shotgun to his shoulder.
35:01
He got a much steadier aim at the branch he wanted to shoot.
35:08
When he fired the gun, it had no place to go.
35:12
The kickback, or whatever from the gun, had no place to go
35:16
and really hurt his shoulder.
35:18
That was the way not to do it.
35:23
Glenn Hawk apparently taught us that.
35:34
Did you have
35:39
much experience out in the woods before this happened?
35:40
Sounds like you were doing laboratory work.
35:45
Yeah, I had some.
35:46
I had been in scouting and I did an Outward Bound program.
35:51
I was pretty comfortable in the outdoors, and I did a lot of mountaineering
35:54
through my undergraduate, too.
35:58
So, being in the outdoors didn’t bother me.
36:08
There was no problem actually being in a car on a logging road.
36:13
We had these big cylinders of gas that we had to carry around everywhere, and
36:18
we were really worried that if you broke the valve stem on one of these, it could
36:25
just be a bomb, we were always concerned about that, and Running was very careful.
36:30
He made a box that kind of bolted down in the back of the station wagon and
36:38
kept it stable.
36:38
We had to carry this large, full-size cylinder of nitrogen
36:42
gas everywhere we went.
36:43
Now, if we had been rear-ended, you know, by a logging truck or something
36:47
and had broken the valve stem on that cylinder, it would have just taken off.
36:53
That was probably one of the biggest dangers and one of our biggest concerns.
36:56
What was that for?
36:57
It was for the pressure bomb.
36:59
You see, to do the
37:02
plant moisture stress measurements, you had to put the plant in a chamber
37:05
with the cut branch end sticking out.
37:09
Then you would apply pressure and would restore moisture up to the cut end, and
37:14
the amount of pressure that it took was equal and opposite to the tension that
37:19
was present within the plant when it was pulling the water column up the leaves.
37:25
It’s a very good, accurate measurement of the moisture stress, the
37:30
tension the water column is under.
37:34
But you had to carry around a source of pressure with you,
37:37
which meant a big cylinder of gas.
37:42
That was probably one of the biggest dangers, but nothing ever happened.
37:46
We
37:48
were driving old station wagons at that time.
37:51
There wasn’t even a radio at that time, and the OSU motor pool wouldn’t even
37:56
issue a car with radios, AM/FM radios, because they were, you know, frivolous.
38:04
Now,
38:08
you can’t buy a car without a radio, or it is cheaper for them to get them with it.
38:14
Anyways, we were driving old, old station wagons
38:21
around the Andrews.
38:23
I guess at that point in my life, you know, when you’re a teenager,
38:32
nothing can happen, so we didn’t really worry about that.
38:32
What led you to leave OSU and go elsewhere for your graduate work
38:49
at that point?
38:50
When
38:56
I left OSU [chuckles], one thing I knew was that I wanted to do be a forester.
39:00
Another thing that I always wanted to do was to go into Peace Corps, so I quit
39:08
working on the Andrews program in June of
39:15
‘76, and the next month, in July of ‘76, I was in Africa working in
39:23
the Peace Corps.
39:23
Then my life kind of went off in that direction.
39:25
I worked for six years overseas in West Africa, and I spent
39:32
five years on a Ph.D. program.
39:36
So, it wasn’t for ten or eleven years that I got back to the Pacific Northwest.
39:44
At that point, I was working with OSU and started working
39:52
at the Andrews again.
39:52
In the meantime, what about OSU or the Andrews led you back there, and why
39:57
return after all the work in West Africa?
40:00
Yeah.
40:01
Well, it was a good opportunity to work.
40:08
Once I got my Ph.D. at Cornell, I was married, had kids, and I needed work.
40:18
This was a good opportunity and to come work in the OSU College of Forestry.
40:21
I applied, and was lucky enough to get it.
40:22
So, I ended up
40:31
back here.
40:35
At first, my work didn’t directly associate me with the Andrews, but
40:40
I made contacts, renewed my old contacts with Art McKee and others.
40:46
Had you been in touch much in the interim?
40:51
In the interim, a little bit, a little bit.
40:53
I would always look up McKee and Running at national meetings.
40:57
We would go to the ESA, Ecological Society of America, when I did my masters.
41:07
When I did my masters after the Peace Corps up at the University of Washington,
41:12
I was in touch with people here at that
41:20
time.
41:20
It was usually through scientific meetings that I would kind of stay
41:25
in touch with folks at the Andrews, and people I had worked with.
41:32
You came back as a post-doc?
41:34
Yeah, I came back on a post-doc, essentially.
41:37
When did you wind up going up to Evergreen?
41:40
[College in Olympia, Washington]
41:40
I came back here in January ‘91, and I started work at Evergreen in the spring of
41:51
‘95.
41:51
In the interim, I worked somewhat on a program that kept me in the
41:56
Coast Range, not at the Andrews.
41:58
But then, starting in about ‘92, ‘93,
42:06
I started working on the Andrews program,
42:11
which I’ve been doing ever since.
42:15
Mostly I’ve been affiliated with the Cascade Center [for Ecosystem Management]
42:19
, as opposed to the Andrews proper, although now I’m doing more in the Andrews proper.
42:23
The Cascade Center is an interesting alliance between the
42:29
Department of Forest Science, the
42:33
Willamette National Forest, mainly the Blue River Ranger
42:35
District, the Andrews and the
42:41
PNW Station.
42:46
I’ve really enjoyed that, working with
42:51
the ranger district and the projects that we’ve been working on.
42:55
Back up a little bit, and we
42:57
will talk about the transition from your 1970’s undergraduate
43:03
work through your return in the ‘90’s.
43:05
What were the
43:10
major transitions of Andrews in that period?
43:11
I want to get two things here, first, if you can remember when you first came
43:11
out here as an undergraduate, what was your perception of what you thought of
43:11
experimental forests for the purpose of the forest and the site itself.
43:25
Do you remember?
43:30
Well,
43:33
at that time I think my thoughts were pretty traditional.
43:37
Ecosystem science wasn’t something that I really appreciated, and I think it
43:42
was the Andrews that made me appreciate that, whereas my concept at that time
43:48
in the early ‘70’s of what forest research and what experimental forests
43:53
were all about, was very traditional.
43:58
Explain what you mean by traditional.
43:59
Oh, what I mean is it would have to do with how a given species of
44:05
tree would grow on a given site and how that would be harvested, and
44:10
how much wood it would produce, and maybe how that individual species
44:16
of tree would work physiologically, and how it would grow faster.
44:20
But it didn’t take in all the ramifications of the ecosystem, which
44:25
is what we deal with now and what the International Biological Program at
44:30
the Andrews made us all appreciate.
44:32
It just was a quantum leap or maybe several orders of magnitude more
44:40
complex when we were done with it.
44:45
It really made us realize how challenging it is to deal with forest
44:49
ecosystems as opposed to agricultural systems, which is what forestry really
44:55
was much akin to not that long ago.
45:00
Can you tell, had you been involved with or even been in any other
45:04
experimental forests up until that time?
45:05
Let me think.
45:05
You mentioned the McDonald Forest.
45:10
[OSU’s McDonald-Dunn Forest near Corvallis]
45:13
. Well, of course, McDonald Forest.
45:16
As an undergraduate, I did
45:21
all of my undergraduate studies out there.
45:26
Instead of having a summer camp, we just went to “Mac” Forest every
45:30
week, almost every day, in the vans.
45:34
The Mac Forest was at that time, as much as anything, a learning
45:42
environment as much as it was a research environment.
45:45
There were a lot class labs conducted out there, and
45:54
a fair amount of research.
45:56
There has always been a fair amount of research, but for
45:57
me as an undergraduate, it was
46:02
the learning,
46:06
the labs and what not, that we would do out there.
46:14
In addition to different research trials, which were usually species-oriented or
46:29
site-oriented, that learning was not so much ecosystem-oriented, which
46:34
is what is going on at the Andrews.
46:38
When you went to the Andrews, was there anything that kind of hit you that this is
46:41
different than the whole forest, something that kind of hit you in the face?
46:49
Yeah, in many ways the Andrews as a piece of land, was really remarkable.
46:56
I think the beautiful old-growth stands that are there, and the
47:01
work that had been done to document those old-growth stands and their
47:05
differences in climate as you go up a relatively steep altitudinal gradient.
47:11
I think that’s what, even at that time, was really striking about the Andrews,
47:16
these beautiful old growth stands, and then the documentation of them and
47:18
research associated with them via the reference stands that was going on.
47:24
That to me was the most striking thing about the piece of land itself.
47:27
Perhaps more important than even that was just the people, the esprit de corps,
47:30
and the interest that was going on.
47:35
The full ferment of activity had as much to do with the
47:39
people as the place, you know.
47:44
And then, the synergism, obviously to that piece of land, and the
47:48
people that were drawn to it.
47:50
What that created, I think, was a whole research community that
47:54
revolved around the Andrews, that is really unsurpassed in forestry.
47:58
I mean if you look around, and I’ve worked at the University of Washington
48:03
and at Cornell, and have visited the Bloggett Forest for Cal-Berkeley and
48:15
several forests related to Cornell, and there really is nothing that compares.
48:20
I think maybe Oak Ridge in Tennessee, and then Harvard Forest, are
48:27
maybe on a par with the Andrews.
48:30
But they’re really few and far between.
48:34
When you came back in the early ‘90’s, what were the
48:40
first impressions for you here?
48:42
What do you recall when you first arrived?
48:45
You were expecting something.
48:47
What did you find?
48:49
A lot of what had happened in the interim, was the building that had gone on.
48:56
At that time, there were a lot more buildings and a lot more of
49:01
a permanent focus on research, than had been there before.
49:08
Like I said, when I left, there was only a warehouse, and when I came
49:12
back, there were several warehouses and office-trailer combinations, and
49:17
people living up there all the time.
49:21
In many ways, the focus was now the place that we would
49:26
interact, this group of buildings.
49:28
And in many ways, the land was still the same.
49:31
There was some research going on, notably Dave Perry had
49:35
installed some experiments, and
49:40
now the focus was long-term.
49:42
It was the LTER program instead of the IBP program, and LTER was unsurpassed
49:47
in its commitment to the long haul.
49:51
That just brought another, a different perspective.
49:55
In other words, it wasn’t a short burst of research in half a decade.
50:04
It was several decades, centuries of work, that was going to be
50:10
going on at that site, and it was obviously this new commitment.
50:14
That it had been named [a reserve] in the Man and the Biosphere Program [of
50:18
UNESCO] , which was obviously a serious commitment, not only on the part of
50:33
OSU.
50:34
I felt proud to have started there, you know, and then to have gone
50:37
away and come back and seen that this place had really blossomed
50:42
and been recognized by the world-at-large.
50:47
So, it’s a big part of me, as a person, as a scientist.
50:57
I would like to see it succeed, and I would like to do more stuff there.
50:59
You came back here at kind of critical point in your development as a scientist,
51:04
just finishing your Ph.D. What were your priorities in going to the Andrews?
51:08
What kinds of projects were you interested in pursuing at that point?
51:17
I’ve always been interested in how the Hi-15 [experimental watersheds]
51:21
has developed since I’ve first worked there, and that will continue
51:24
to be a place I’m interested in.
51:29
But Art McKee is a friend that I’ve had since the time I was there as an
51:35
undergraduate, and his work had always been invested as well in that particular
51:41
place, the Hi-15 [Watersheds 6, 7, and 8, the experimental watersheds
51:47
which comprise the Hi-15 study site] . A lot of the faces were new.
51:51
I mean, Art is one of the few people
51:55
that’s provided continuity and has been there since the
52:00
early ‘70’s and is there now.
52:02
Fred Swanson as well, is there, but he’s a physical scientist really,
52:08
and I didn’t work with him early on.
52:10
He came in after you had left.
52:12
Yeah, he came in, I think in the early ‘70’s.
52:15
But, like I say, he was a hydrologist [geologist-ecologist] , and at that time
52:20
we weren’t doing ecosystem science, so we weren’t interacting as much as we are now,
52:25
even though IBP did create a fair amount of interaction and I still hung out at
52:33
that time.
52:33
I think it
52:36
would have been hard to believe a physical scientist, which is what
52:41
Fred is, could have led a group of biological scientists, which is what
52:45
he is doing and has been doing for a long time, and doing really well.
52:50
But, that maturation of the intellectual approach to forestry, I think created
52:56
an environment that allowed that
53:05
to happen.
53:06
Was there a strong relation between what you’ve been doing in your Ph.D. research,
53:09
and what you found yourself doing at the Andrews when you got here in ’91?
53:14
No.
53:14
My Ph.
53:15
D. was completely related to allocating hardwoods in the East and sugar
53:19
maple, maple syrup for that matter.
53:23
It
53:26
was related to tree physiology, but not to the same species and same environment.
53:35
But, because I had worked there before, I felt very comfortable getting back
53:39
into it and switching species and environments, but using a similar
53:46
approach that I learned in IBP.
53:47
So, you were thinking more in terms of career path and potential opportunities
53:47
than you were about where can I
53:59
take the skills I learned and apply them.
54:02
It sounds like you were willing to shift your research priorities.
54:06
Absolutely.
54:08
I was willing to drop sugar maple and the work I’d done there, for
54:14
the opportunity to come here to OSU.
54:17
Once I got to OSU, I was anxious to renew my relationship with the Andrews,
54:24
and I’m really glad that’s where I’m at.
54:27
I can’t imagine anything at the OSU College of Forestry that I’d rather
54:31
be doing than working with the Andrews program and Cascade Center.
54:36
It’s clearly
54:39
the program that best fits my personal interests, and where I
54:44
think forestry should be going.
54:46
You mentioned Art McKee several times.
54:48
Who did you work most closely with in the early ‘90’s when you were here?
54:52
When I first came here?
54:54
Yeah.
54:56
Like I said, when I first came here, I was more associated with coastal
54:59
forests and not with the Andrews.
55:02
It was a program called COPE, Coastal Oregon Productivity Enhancement.
55:12
Andy Hanson, who worked in COPE and did work at the Andrews, he,
55:29
probably as much as anyone, was able to work at the Andrews and at the
55:36
same time do research on the coast.
55:40
So, in some ways I followed him because he went from the COPE program to work with
55:48
the LTER group, and I did the same thing.
55:54
I went from the COPE program, but in a very different way in
56:08
many ways, and Fred was glad to see both Andy and I make our way to
56:15
the
56:18
LTER.
56:19
How did you find the Andrews?
56:22
Obviously, there wasn’t much of a staff there in the early ‘70’s.
56:25
Or was there?
56:26
At the Andrews?
56:27
At the Andrews, because there really wasn’t a site.
56:28
There wasn’t a permanent staff.
56:32
I don’t know if Art was even around yet.
56:33
I don't know if they actually called him the director then?
56:37
Maybe they did.
56:38
He was a coordinator in the field, I think was what they
56:46
called him.
56:48
Somewhere around there.
56:49
I’m trying to remember the years.
56:53
But Art was the person we associated with most closely with the Andrews,
57:01
mostly because he is very bright and was able to absorb all of the
57:04
minutiae of information that was associated with the Andrews, so if
57:07
anybody had a question, they would go ask him and he generally knew.
57:11
So, Art’s
57:16
the person that that
57:21
really comes to mind.
57:22
I guess what I am getting at, you mentioned earlier, that when you first
57:22
went there in the ‘70’s, you dealt pretty much with Steve Running, and it sounds
57:22
like the two of you were pretty much on
57:46
your
57:55
own.
57:56
When you came back in the ‘90’s, you mentioned the different
57:56
facilities and the congregation of people at the headquarters there.
57:56
Looking at the quality of interaction between you and other scientists,
57:56
were there people that you worked with
57:59
on an ongoing daily basis, or people that you were kind of casually meeting,
58:03
but doing your own thing still?
58:03
At that time, it was much more casual.
58:07
It wasn’t that a lot of that has to do with the Andrews and functioning of
58:15
it as an interdisciplinary group and the Andrews proper, but the monthly
58:21
meeting that Fred religiously holds there which brings together people, and
58:27
that’s two hours away from the Andrews.
58:29
But the fact this meeting takes place every first Friday of each month,
58:35
means that everybody associated with the Andrews, if they have a
58:39
concern or they want to hear about something, they know to go there.
58:43
Fred’s been really good about that, and that’s a real important thing he’s
58:49
made sure happens, and not only does he make sure the meeting happens, but
58:52
he personally makes sure the notes from each of those meetings comes
58:55
out and there is a record of that.
58:59
The style that the meetings are carried on is very open and informative.
59:05
It’s
59:08
really to his credit I think that the program has functioned so well, and
59:12
the Andrews has continued to have the focus that it has, and that monthly
59:15
meeting, in many ways, has a lot to do with it, even though, like I say,
59:20
it’s two hours away from the Andrews.
59:22
It’s at a place where most of the people that are concerned
59:24
about the Andrews are on
59:29
a regular basis.
59:31
It’s interesting that several people mentioned in various
59:34
ways that there was a shift.
59:35
Earlier there was field research and then there was a shift to laboratory work, and
59:36
Art pointed out that there was a shift from agency work to university work.
59:37
There was kind of a transition, but with
59:44
what
59:51
you’re working on now, is a shift in the other direction again.
59:56
Well, it’s more agency-oriented.
59:58
You see, the Cascade Center does that, because the Cascade Center
1:00:02
for Ecosystem Management involves the Willamette National Forest and
1:00:05
the Blue River Ranger District.
1:00:06
We’re doing, you know, agency-oriented type of stuff.
1:00:10
And in many ways, I feel like I work for
1:00:15
the National Forest system as much as OSU, because my money comes from
1:00:21
the National Forest system now.
1:00:25
I feel like I work very independently of them, and I always challenge them
1:00:29
intellectually in a lot of ways.
1:00:31
But, I think that if we did make a move away from doing
1:00:42
applied work, the Cascade Center brings us back to that.
1:00:48
Just curious.
1:00:50
You
1:00:53
focused on the program in the IBP days with a burst of creative energy and people
1:00:59
under a sense of mission, and now there is this long-term potential with LTER,
1:01:06
and now what you have is a more conscious structuring of the community of scientists
1:01:14
you have with all these LTER meetings.
1:01:14
What is the difference from earlier?
1:01:18
I’m just curious how that influences the way ideas are formed, and what I’m
1:01:19
thinking of here, specifically, are your current efforts to develop this
1:01:23
“uneven-aged management” study with practical, in-the-field applications.
1:01:23
I just wanted to ask you to talk about the origins of that idea,
1:01:24
that concept, scientific origins or
1:01:35
the community-agency interaction origins.
1:01:46
How did that idea originate?
1:01:47
Who is involved?
1:01:49
The idea of the Uneven-Aged Management Project is about uneven-aged management.
1:02:12
What has been commonly practiced and traditionally practiced in the Pacific
1:02:16
Northwest, is even-age management, not uneven-age management [“even-age
1:02:20
management” generally means clearcutting] . The reason for this is that
1:02:29
right after the Second World War, well, in the late 30’s and 40’s and early
1:02:35
50’s, there were attempts to partially cut Douglas-fir forests, to practice
1:02:39
uneven-age management in old-growth forests, and for a variety of reasons it
1:02:45
didn’t work. This research wasn’t actually carried on in the Andrews itself, but was
1:02:50
done throughout the Pacific Northwest.
1:02:52
Those forests were of such large structure
1:02:58
that it was very difficult to bring down these large trees, to get them
1:03:05
out of the forest and not destroy the understory which would be necessarily
1:03:10
be preserved to carry on with uneven-age management [i.e., trees intended to
1:03:15
be left would be destroyed in logging operations] . But what we’re trying now,
1:03:21
is not uneven-age management starting with old-growth forests, but uneven-age
1:03:26
management with very young forests.
1:03:29
The Andrews, having liquidated a fair amount of its old growth the last few
1:03:36
decades, is now at a point where those stands have been regenerated and we
1:03:40
have young stands which can be managed in a variety of different ways, one of
1:03:48
which would be uneven-age management.
1:03:51
Since it was tried on old growth some decades ago, it really hasn’t
1:03:56
been tried by agencies since then.
1:04:00
Small landowners have tried it in a small way, and their
1:04:04
reasons for doing it are varied.
1:04:08
One of the biggest reasons is that people have a strong infinity to their
1:04:16
own small piece of land, and they don’t necessarily want to cut it all down.
1:04:19
They don’t want to clear-cut it.
1:04:20
So, there’s the aesthetic thing, but there is also a desire to have a
1:04:24
small, continuous income, instead of a boom-or-bust kind of thing that even-age
1:04:30
management and clear-cutting brings you.
1:04:32
Small landowners are particularly sensitive to that, if they are wanting
1:04:35
to have a regular income out of it.
1:04:38
Also, another thing is that small landowners don’t
1:04:40
necessarily have the best land.
1:04:45
The timber industry has done everything they can to buy up the best pieces
1:04:49
of land and put it in good blocks.
1:04:51
Starker, for example, did that in Benton County and around here, and
1:04:57
then of course, other bigger timber industries have done that as well.
1:05:01
That has left smaller landowners often with the more droughty
1:05:06
soils and more inland areas.
1:05:10
So those areas, in many ways, lend themselves more to uneven-age
1:05:15
management because they don’t produce dense forests, trees that are rapidly
1:05:21
growing and closing the canopy quickly.
1:05:24
They produce more open, park-like forests, like what you would find
1:05:28
on the east side, where uneven-age management occurs naturally.
1:05:37
By trying uneven-age management here on the west side and at the Andrews in
1:05:43
particular, we’re trying a system that has more history with small land owners
1:05:50
and which we’ll probably have to work at.
1:05:54
In other words, the ecosystem doesn’t necessarily lend itself to it as much
1:06:00
as the east side where you naturally get very open park-like forests with
1:06:05
multiple age classes of trees with prolific understory regeneration.
1:06:08
We’ll probably have to thin to create regeneration.
1:06:12
Whereas, on many drier ecosystems, like on the east side, you get
1:06:17
fires which would sweep through.
1:06:21
Here, particularly with fire
1:06:25
suppression, we don’t have that so much on the west side.
1:06:32
The public as well as the scientific community, is anxious to try
1:06:38
alternatives to clear-cutting.
1:06:40
They’ve seen what clear-cutting does from an aesthetic point-of-view,
1:06:44
a wildlife point-of-view, and an ecosystem productivity point-of-view.
1:06:50
There were concerns that by removing all of the forest cover in a given area, and
1:06:56
then also by slash burning, which is often associated with that, that we may be over
1:07:04
the long haul, be reducing productivity.
1:07:07
Now, there is another project specifically looking at that: LTEP,
1:07:11
or Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity.
1:07:14
But these are general concerns that people have.
1:07:17
Any question in forestry is going to take decades, centuries, to really answer.
1:07:21
But,
1:07:24
I think we have to stay ahead of the game and try
1:07:31
different things, try alternatives to clear-cutting and uneven-age
1:07:39
management, are what needs trying.
1:07:42
It’s interesting, because up until World War II, the Forest Service was in a
1:07:43
position of generally trying to promote selective-cutting over clear-cutting, and
1:07:44
after World War II is when clearcutting on Forest Service lands began.
1:07:45
As you talk of this agency-driven shift in LTER, there’s a return to that
1:07:45
earlier philosophy, although it’s not the same thought, but it’s not clear- cut.
1:07:46
I am curious, is there a chain of scientists or
1:08:36
particular people whose work was influential in leading up to the point
1:08:39
at which you’re at, where you come in, say, with some authority now, and have
1:08:39
people follow your suggestion that we
1:08:42
should be trying these
1:08:46
alternative strategies?
1:08:55
I think the best examples,
1:08:59
unfortunately, are not in the American forestry literature.
1:09:05
They are in European forestry literature.
1:09:09
And in some cases with our own species
1:09:14
like Douglas-fir.
1:09:17
The Europeans have been practicing uneven-age management in coniferous
1:09:21
forests for much longer than we have.
1:09:30
It’s in Germany.
1:09:32
It’s in Europe.
1:09:32
I’ve had a hard time really getting into it.
1:09:39
Of course, that’s where Fernow came from.
1:09:41
Right, that’s where Fernow is from.
1:09:42
And Fernow was into even-age management, as much of Prussia was managed, and
1:09:49
there is also uneven-age management in Germany that has continued to this day.
1:09:58
And
1:10:05
the eastern United States and intermountain west has
1:10:10
practiced uneven-age management.
1:10:14
There really is very little on the west side, I should say in the Pacific
1:10:20
Northwest, as far as research goes that guides us in this direction.
1:10:25
Clearly, we will have to work at it to make it work in very
1:10:30
dense, productive forests.
1:10:38
I personally think that it is worth working at finding solutions
1:10:44
or alternatives to clear-cutting.
1:10:46
I’m not saying that uneven-age management will be more “natural,” quote-unquote,
1:10:53
than even-age management or clear-cutting.
1:10:58
It will require more frequent entries and much more intensive stand-tending.
1:11:04
But it will also avoid the catastrophic effects of clear-cutting, which not
1:11:11
only has aesthetic problems, but from a wildlife point-of-view, in ecosystems from
1:11:16
a region lacking in mature and old-growth forest habitats, we need to maintain
1:11:21
closed-canopy forests, and thinning can clearly benefit the development of
1:11:30
forests structure, but clear-cutting
1:11:35
is often very detrimental.
1:11:39
Like I said, the best examples don’t come from this region.
1:11:42
I think, that’s in many ways, the reason why we need to at least try it here.
1:11:49
It may not work.
1:11:53
It will be possible to do it, the question is how feasible is it to do it?
1:11:59
Uneven-age management, as much as anything, requires good knowledge of
1:12:03
the stand and regular stand-tending.
1:12:05
It will mean that foresters will have to be intimately involved with their forests.
1:12:09
They will have to know it’s done right, and when it’s done
1:12:12
right by small landowners, they know personally, each tree.
1:12:16
They know that this tree is not ready to be cut now, but in five years this one
1:12:22
growing next to it will be bigger, and you can remove this one and replace that one.
1:12:27
That kind of a knowledge on a tree-to-tree basis, is where it works best.
1:12:33
Any land management agency cannot afford to
1:12:38
have that kind of
1:12:41
relationship with its forests.
1:12:43
It is much more of a broad-brush approach, and that’s why most forest
1:12:50
practices have been more akin to agriculture than anything else.
1:12:55
But
1:12:59
with small landowners in the United States, and then also
1:13:02
with “forest meisters” in Germany, who have lived with a
1:13:10
given parcel of land and worked with it for their entire career, and they
1:13:13
become intimately involved with it.
1:13:15
Whereas, the Forest Service and other land management agencies, but
1:13:17
particularly the Forest Service, are
1:13:20
in the habit of constantly moving people around from one ranger district
1:13:24
to the next all over the United States, and that does not develop
1:13:27
the kind of relationship between a forester and his forest necessary
1:13:34
to really understand what is going
1:13:40
on.
1:13:40
I’m not saying it is definitely going to work; a lot of things would
1:13:44
have to change to make it work.
1:13:47
But I think it’s worth trying, and it’s worth seeing what it
1:13:51
would take to make it work.
1:13:54
Because, if nothing else, these are public forests and the public is concerned
1:14:00
as to why we haven’t come up with alternatives to clear-cutting,
1:14:04
which is clearly something that has serious concerns attached.
1:14:09
For
1:14:13
too long, we have gone on saying there are no alternatives.
1:14:16
There are alternatives, but the question is: are we willing to go to
1:14:20
the extent needed to implement them?
1:14:23
A couple things come to mind here.
1:14:26
One is, in the time that you were absent from the Northwest, there
1:14:33
was a major issue over old growth that involved people working
1:14:44
at the Andrews becoming essential to that public debate which ensued.
1:14:44
One of the questions is, how much did that have an influence on
1:14:48
your decision to come out here?
1:14:49
Obviously, that brings the forest into the limelight and some
1:14:53
of these questions that you had an interest in.
1:15:01
Yeah, to a large degree,
1:15:04
when I came back out here 1991, the spotted owl controversy was at its
1:15:11
height, and there were people who were still desperately holding on
1:15:17
and thinking that they could hold off
1:15:24
efforts to preserve remaining old growth.
1:15:32
I just kind of parachuted in to the middle of that controversy.
1:15:38
It
1:15:40
was really very interesting to me, because the undergraduate thesis that
1:15:45
I had done looked at what we call advanced regeneration, or the small
1:15:50
trees that are regenerating in the understory, and those are just the kind
1:15:55
of trees that need to be promoted to a position of canopy dominance with
1:16:03
partial cutting or other alternatives to clear-cutting.
1:16:11
I’ve always
1:16:18
had some of these concerns and think I came back at a time where, in many
1:16:23
ways, I’ve thought this too, that it was in some ways better to go away
1:16:28
and come back twenty years later.
1:16:32
Rather than
1:16:37
to hang around here and fight the fight all those years, because
1:16:44
it was clear to me that at least shelterwood cutting, as opposed to
1:16:47
clear-cutting, was a much better way to develop advanced regeneration, understory
1:16:54
structure and understory cohorts.
1:16:56
That was obvious to me in the mid ‘70’s, and yet people thought I
1:17:03
was nuts to be concerned about these small understory trees.
1:17:10
So, in many ways, I think it was fortuitous to go
1:17:14
away and then to come back.
1:17:15
And now there’s a much more obvious acceptance to alternatives to
1:17:21
clear-cutting, and the concern for many cohorts of trees as opposed
1:17:25
to one single cohort of trees.
1:17:32
There is a different level of involvement necessary
1:17:48
with talking about now, between scientists, researchers and the forest
1:17:48
managers, in the region and district.
1:17:49
We need to talk over about your relationship with people
1:17:51
in the region and the forests.
1:17:53
I think that in the past,
1:17:58
managers in the Blue River Ranger District were interested
1:18:07
in implementing timber sales to do these scientific experiments,
1:18:12
but it wasn’t something they were really directly commissioning.
1:18:23
They were really interested in seeing the results.
1:18:27
This was just something those scientists were interested in, and
1:18:30
it was their job, and the managers were going to help them do it.
1:18:33
That’s how Watersheds 1 and 2, 6, 7 and 8, were put
1:18:38
in [H.J. Andrews] . Now it is very different;
1:18:44
the National Forest System is really under the gun; they are in court.
1:18:49
People want to know why they have to clear-cut, and are there other things
1:18:53
they can be doing, not only to do as alternatives to clear-cutting, but to
1:18:59
develop young stands to replace old-growth stands that have been liquidated.
1:19:06
Can’t we raise forests to engender mature and old-growth characteristics?
1:19:12
So, the National Forest System is actively seeking responses to these
1:19:19
kinds of questions, instead of just being a steward to forest lands
1:19:24
for scientists of the university.
1:19:35
They are now, through the Cascade Center, becoming more involved than ever.
1:19:41
At least, that’s the end of things I work on.
1:19:44
There are others, like Mark Harmon, and those who work more directly with
1:19:50
LTER, that are less closely associated
1:19:55
with the National Forest System and Blue River Ranger District.
1:19:59
But I, personally, and others
1:20:01
at the Cascade Center are increasingly
1:20:09
associated with them.
1:20:11
And it’s a really useful relationship because, by being an employee of Oregon
1:20:16
State University as opposed to an employee of the Forest Service, I can
1:20:20
maintain my intellectual integrity.
1:20:26
I don’t have to toe the line of the Forest Service; getting the “cut out” is the
1:20:31
last thing on my mind. Okay, but at the same time, they can avail themselves of
1:20:42
our expertise [“getting the cut out” was a Timber Era expression for
1:20:43
meeting the timber targets of ranger districts or national forests] . And
1:20:44
we can be of service to them.
1:20:48
I think it is a very useful relationship, an incredibly useful relationship, and the
1:20:54
Andrews is really very unique in that way.
1:20:56
I don’t know how many other
1:21:02
experimental forests there are, where the director is a university
1:21:07
employee, and yet, the forest land is part of the National Forest System.
1:21:12
Art McKee’s situation is a very difficult one, yet it is a very unique and useful
1:21:17
to the forestry community-at-large.
1:21:21
Art may have filled you in on how unique the situation is, and how difficult it is.
1:21:28
But it is really critically important that somebody like him be a university
1:21:33
employee, and that there are people like me and others that are university
1:21:37
employees, and yet they are working on Forest Service land and on problems
1:21:42
that concern these public lands.
1:21:45
Because, unless we are university employees, we can’t maintain our autonomy
1:21:49
from the interests of “getting the cut out,” or whatever they may be interested
1:21:54
in, ultimately. And that’s important.
1:21:55
I was just going to say, there’s an interesting issue you touched on
1:21:57
earlier that I wanted to revisit.
1:21:59
Perhaps fortuitously, you were gone for a while and came back.
1:22:03
I was wondering, some problems with maintaining autonomy have to do
1:22:05
with the way that scientists have been brought into the public eye.
1:22:06
There’s not just autonomy, but appearance about what’s important.
1:22:06
I was wondering, in the case of Eric Forsman [Northern
1:22:08
spotted owl researcher] , what
1:22:28
kind
1:22:31
of pressure was he under that you aren’t having to face?
1:22:38
Well, I don’t know the pressures that Eric Forsman was under.
1:22:46
He does work for the Forest Service, although he is with the PNW Station as
1:22:53
opposed to the National Forest system.
1:22:55
So, it is a little different.
1:23:13
Most of the
1:23:17
people, for example, who work for the PNW Station are ultimately part of
1:23:27
the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Department
1:23:33
of Agriculture, and Congress puts certain mandates on them.
1:23:38
I don’t know how difficult it is to operate in their work
1:23:44
environment, if they don’t align themselves with those mandates.
1:23:48
I should think that getting research funding is a lot easier, if you
1:23:54
are more interested in traditional types of things, but I think that he
1:23:59
would be in a much better position.
1:24:01
People like Fred Swanson would be in a much better position to answer that.
1:24:06
I, for one, personally, am glad that I am working
1:24:13
at the university end of things, just because I think
1:24:20
it allows me to
1:24:23
intellectually align myself with what I think is important.
1:24:31
If I worked for an organization,
1:24:36
I think, instinctively, I would want to align myself with the concerns
1:24:40
of that organization, but I can’t really speak for those people.
1:24:48
I’m just curious because you’re in a totally different situation here,
1:24:53
in that you’ve been at the Andrews or been affiliated with OSU and the Andrews as
1:24:59
an undergraduate, as a post-doc, and now as a cooperator for another university.
1:25:05
We start talking about this
1:25:11
and concepts of autonomy when you float from place to place.
1:25:14
This is a different category.
1:25:15
I’m not saying it’s better or worse.
1:25:16
I’m just interested if you have any insights on what is the situation of a
1:25:22
cooperator with the Andrews group when you are on appointment at OSU right now.
1:25:31
But that might change.
1:25:32
I may go to be
1:25:36
an employee elsewhere and not be an employee of OSU.
1:25:41
Yeah, I think that
1:25:44
you become
1:25:50
less directly involved.
1:25:51
But, the way that things are run, and I think that the esprit that
1:26:00
people like Fred Swanson promote
1:26:04
is
1:26:08
very inclusive, and it doesn’t really tend to throw up boundaries for one
1:26:14
person as opposed to another person.
1:26:19
I think that
1:26:23
the most important thing,
1:26:27
from my point-of-view,
1:26:30
from doing silvicultural research in the Andrews, is to be aligned with the
1:26:35
needs and concerns of the Forest Service.
1:26:40
Because I think the ultimate clientele for the
1:26:52
Andrews is the people and the managers that are charged with
1:26:57
managing the people’s land.
1:27:01
I think “alternative” silviculture is in many ways, fulfilling that
1:27:11
need.
1:27:12
The Blue River Ranger District realizes that; the Cascade Center realizes that.
1:27:18
And if I can convince them that answering questions about uneven-age
1:27:24
management are going to be questions that are useful to them as land
1:27:28
managers and useful to the public that are concerned about the management
1:27:33
of their lands, then I think that
1:27:38
is going to be something that can be done or something that can be broached.
1:27:46
But it doesn’t necessarily have to be something that was done in the past
1:27:49
or something that is traditional.
1:27:53
In many ways, I feel like I can get the best of both worlds.
1:28:00
There is a real synergism by bringing together these different
1:28:03
organizations under the umbrella of public land management,
1:28:12
and that I think the Forest Service alone could never get, or even the PNW
1:28:18
Station and the National Forest System could never get, if OSU wasn’t involved.
1:28:25
And the best example of that is the fact that OSU has brought in so much
1:28:29
National Science Foundation funding.
1:28:32
That would not have happened, clearly, if OSU was not there, because the research
1:28:37
community at large, the national research community, would not have recognized
1:28:42
the Andrews as the center for objective scientific research, if it hadn’t involved
1:28:51
Oregon State University.
1:28:56
I guess it is
1:29:03
remarkable to me is that there is,
1:29:07
from what you’re saying, very little difference between being a cooperator
1:29:13
and being a post-doc, permanently associating with people here.
1:29:14
And that is due to the fact that you spend nine months of the year up at
1:29:14
Evergreen State College [Olympia, Wash.] teaching, and come down here
1:29:14
for three months in the summer.
1:29:15
Two things that I am curious about.
1:29:16
One is, do you see a change in your relationship the
1:29:17
longer you stay at Evergreen?
1:29:18
And two, what are the mechanisms that allow someone like yourself
1:29:20
to be fully integrated into the group while you’re down here?
1:29:23
How do
1:29:30
they accomplish that?
1:29:43
Well,
1:29:46
it is true that the longer that I have been here,
1:29:53
the more I’ve kind of detached myself and moved toward Evergreen, which
1:29:58
has provided me with a permanent job.
1:30:01
But, at the same time, the longer I’ve been here, the more I’ve
1:30:04
become familiar with the people and the issues, and the more I think
1:30:06
that I’ve been respected for that.
1:30:09
So, one has kind of
1:30:12
countered the other.
1:30:15
Now,
1:30:19
what was the other question that you had?
1:30:21
I’m curious what the mechanisms are that that the group has developed?
1:30:27
I think the mechanism that has kept me involved and has kept me well
1:30:31
associated, is what I’ve mentioned before, and that is the monthly meetings.
1:30:38
It so happens that my personal situation is such that I have two sons that live
1:30:44
down here near Corvallis, and I come down here every month to spend time with them.
1:30:52
I do that to coincide with the LTER meeting.
1:30:56
So, I make every LTER meeting
1:31:01
and it fits well into my personal life,
1:31:07
and that’s what’s kept me involved.
1:31:11
It sounds partly because you built your personal life around that?
1:31:13
Exactly.
1:31:14
That is a critical element.
1:31:14
Yeah,
1:31:23
I know the first Friday of every month that I’m going to come to the
1:31:31
meeting, and then after that I will spend the weekend with my sons.
1:31:35
And that’s added a certain continuity to our lives, in a
1:31:39
professional and a personal level.
1:31:45
I don’t want to keep you here too long.
1:31:46
No,
1:31:54
that is all right.
1:31:55
It’s quite fine.
1:31:55
Art and I talked a little about the decision made fairly early, to use
1:31:56
post-docs as opposed to graduate students, to work on the Andrews.
1:32:06
Of course, that puts post-docs in an unusual position.
1:32:15
It’s a temporary position, not one that is leading to tenure, but they
1:32:15
are usually people that have some
1:32:19
ambition.
1:32:21
I was just wondering, how did you
1:32:28
balance these concerns when you were working there, long-term?
1:32:29
How actively involved were you in seeking a tenure-track position
1:32:32
elsewhere, or where you pretty much resigned to the situation
1:32:38
of being
1:32:41
a post-doc?
1:32:42
I guess I am the kind of person that I have to have some certainty in my life.
1:32:46
I really feel it gnawed away at me that I was operating on soft money, and I
1:32:54
think that’s really what made me want to get that position at Evergreen.
1:33:00
I wanted to know I would have some certainty in my life, and that I wouldn’t
1:33:03
always be operating on soft money.
1:33:09
I had to have that kind of certainty,
1:33:15
and I think all post-docs operate to some degree under that.
1:33:21
Now, some are incredibly productive and successful scientists, like Mark Harmon.
1:33:31
He must have a lot of confidence in knowing what he has produced as far
1:33:39
as research results and publications.
1:33:44
I think there is also a continuing amount of stress, because soft
1:33:47
money is still soft money, no matter how many publications you might
1:33:50
have, and no matter how comfortable you may feel in your situation.
1:33:53
Soft money
1:34:00
is still soft money.
1:34:03
The way I dealt with that is to get another position that could take care of
1:34:09
me for at least nine months of the year.
1:34:11
Then, through my students up at Evergreen and their work down here, I
1:34:14
come down the Andrews for three weeks.
1:34:16
I brought students with me this last spring, and hope to continue that.
1:34:20
So, it’s just the kind of the way that I’ve carved my niche at the Andrews.
1:34:26
But other people do it in different ways.
1:34:27
I imagine Mark Harmon has been so successful in the scientific community,
1:34:32
and has been a real leader, not only in our LTER group, but in LTER nation-wide.
1:34:40
He has a very much a different niche he carved for himself.
1:34:49
But money is so short, and because of Ballot Measure 5, it doesn’t look like
1:34:57
OSU is going to be creating any more tenure-track positions in the near future.
1:35:05
Different people deal with that in different ways.
1:35:12
Some people leave all together.
1:35:15
Andy Hanson was a post-doc here,
1:35:20
and he kind of regretfully left and went to the University of, or Montana State
1:35:26
[University] , in a faculty position.
1:35:26
He had intended to do summer research here, but it was just
1:35:30
too far away and we haven’t seen
1:35:35
Andy.
1:35:35
He wanted to maintain his ties, but wasn’t able to do it.
1:35:40
Maybe I’m kind of in the middle where I’ve kind of maintained my ties,
1:35:43
and then there’s somebody like Mark Harmon that never created new ties.
1:35:50
Clearly, somebody like Mark deserves a tenure-track position,
1:35:54
but the money just ain’t there.
1:36:03
One strategy I think that somebody could try is to become integral in a
1:36:08
group, and then to find a job elsewhere, and say, look I’m going to take this
1:36:13
job, if you don’t create something.
1:36:17
But you have to be really good to do that.
1:36:20
I think Mark could maybe try that, but that would be another
1:36:22
strategy that somebody could.
1:36:26
That could be a very risky strategy, because it might not work.
1:36:28
One paradox at the Andrews is this
1:36:35
long-term work done with all this soft money.
1:36:38
With all these short-term people, that is very true.
1:36:47
There are some old timers like Bill Ferrell and Ted Dyrness, but they
1:36:52
are not as closely connected with it,
1:36:56
and are basically retired.
1:37:02
I think in many ways, the PNW Station provides continuity
1:37:08
because people like Fred Swanson
1:37:14
have been around a long time and will continue to be around, hopefully.
1:37:22
But there aren’t many of them either.
1:37:28
From my personal point-of-view, we clearly need a tenure track or permanent
1:37:35
PNW position to cover silviculture.
1:37:38
What could be more important to an experimental forest, than a
1:37:42
silviculturist that is going to study the culturing of trees and how that’s
1:37:47
going to impact different treatments for experiments in the future.
1:37:52
Yet, that is a position not being filled.
1:37:57
I dealt with it the best I could as a post-doc, but I was focused
1:38:02
on things that would move my career in a more permanent basis.
1:38:08
That didn’t necessarily add continuity to the Andrews.
1:38:15
So, from your research goals, you were thinking in terms of what it
1:38:19
might possibly do in the direction of your practical position?
1:38:24
Yeah.
1:38:25
Maybe I should have been thinking more about that.
1:38:30
One of the problems I’ve had within the Andrews is that
1:38:33
there were several projects.
1:38:35
I’ve worked a lot to get projects going, but these projects won’t really
1:38:40
produce good results for quite a while.
1:38:44
I’ve been as lucky as I have, I think, because people have
1:38:48
been understanding of that.
1:38:50
It hasn’t been so much of a “publish or perish” environment.
1:38:57
As long as I’ve kept these projects going.
1:39:01
We are only now getting the first data set out of a project that was
1:39:08
first was conceived about a decade ago.
1:39:17
Forestry takes that kind of time.
1:39:25
It’s hard, it’s really hard.
1:39:31
But there are people that are able to do a mixture of short-term
1:39:39
results and publish those, and then also longer-term results, from data
1:39:48
maybe other people have abandoned.
1:39:51
People like Mark Harmon have been very successful at that.
1:39:56
Charlie Halpern has as well.
1:40:01
He has made use of some data that Ted Dyrness first started
1:40:06
collecting, then Ted Dyrness went off to Alaska and Charlie Halpern
1:40:13
came along.
1:40:15
As a post-doc, he was basically given stacks and stacks of data sheets.
1:40:23
Through a hell of a lot of hard work, he made sense of them and published on them.
1:40:31
But that wasn’t data that he collected or initiated, but was
1:40:35
data that he was hired to deal with.
1:40:40
That is really a different mode of science than laboratory science, where people
1:40:44
do an experiment and end it in a day.
1:40:47
We do experiments in decades, and
1:40:53
that makes it difficult in many ways to be on soft money in an environment like that.
1:41:00
Makes it very difficult.
1:41:03
That’s why I’m up at Evergreen, because it provides more continuity
1:41:06
in my life than I could get here.
1:41:08
Was there some point at which you reached a decision that it
1:41:12
was time to move on to Evergreen?
1:41:14
You were a post-doc here, for what three or
1:41:19
four years?
1:41:20
Yeah.
1:41:20
Was it just the fact the position was open?
1:41:24
Was there something particular about Evergreen that attracted
1:41:24
you, or was it a decision based on
1:41:28
personal situation at the time
1:41:32
to go on?
1:41:32
Oh, a combination of those things.
1:41:37
I was attracted to Evergreen because
1:41:46
I felt it
1:41:52
had a good reputation for teaching, and because teaching was something I realized
1:41:56
that I really enjoyed, that I loved.
1:42:00
I was given an opportunity to teach a short course, really
1:42:05
enjoyed it and did well.
1:42:08
I said, “Hey, this is something that really gives me a lot of satisfaction
1:42:11
and that I’m good at.” I’d heard of a temporary opportunity at Evergreen, and
1:42:19
I knew that they didn’t have anybody that was really doing applied forest ecology.
1:42:23
There were forest ecologists, but nobody really doing silviculture or applied
1:42:27
forest ecology, so I thought, “This is a niche that I can fill,” and I pursued it.
1:42:40
It did get me into a more permanent situation, one where I didn’t have
1:42:48
dependence on soft money hanging over
1:42:52
me all the time.
1:42:53
In the future, I would like to involve my students up there and to
1:42:59
bring in modest amounts of research money to carry me through a summer.
1:43:04
To continue to fill what my intellectual and research interests are, but at
1:43:11
the same time have the stability of at least a nine-month job.
1:43:15
Have
1:43:18
you had much chance to teach while you were down here?
1:43:22
Something that is really unique about the Department of Forest Science at OSU, is
1:43:27
that we are all in a graduate department and there were very little, if any,
1:43:33
opportunities to teach undergraduates, to do any teaching at all, really.
1:43:41
This affects
1:43:47
post-docs that work at the Andrews.
1:43:52
They have little if any opportunity to do teaching, and they are expected to
1:43:57
be moving into jobs where teaching is going to be a major component of the job.
1:44:03
Yet, they’re not generating the experience to fill those jobs.
1:44:08
This is a real problem, this has come up at Forest Science
1:44:13
retreats, and I’ve pointed it out.
1:44:20
The opportunity I got to teach was through a very narrow window.
1:44:27
The Department of Forest Science here has a relationship with a Forestry College in
1:44:32
Argentina, and I was asked to go there and teach a short course in tree physiology.
1:44:40
It was through that opportunity that
1:44:43
I got to teach, and it was under a difficult situation.
1:44:45
I was teaching non-native English speakers and taught them tree physiology, which
1:44:54
has a lot of details that goes with it,
1:44:58
and yet, it went off well.
1:45:01
So, it was that little opportunity to teach I sort of capitalized on
1:45:07
and it allowed me to go to Evergreen.
1:45:11
Because Evergreen accepted me basically on that experience at
1:45:15
the University of Buenos Aires, and the recommendation I got from that.
1:45:20
If I hadn’t had that, I don’t think I ever would have gotten the job at Evergreen.
1:45:28
But there not many opportunities like that.
1:45:30
Normally, you would be in a department of forestry or department of forest
1:45:37
management, and you would have undergraduates all around you in
1:45:39
your department that needed TA’s, and that needed classes taught.
1:45:43
As a post-doc you would take a quarter and teach a course and
1:45:48
get that kind of experience.
1:45:49
Well we don’t have that around here.
1:45:52
You get kind of locked into being a post-doc doing research, and
1:45:57
it can be difficult to get out
1:46:09
of it.
1:46:09
Did you find your experience in the Peace Corps to be helpful down in Argentina?
1:46:14
Yeah, for sure, and in working for the Forest Service here.
1:46:16
Working with Forest Service
1:46:25
also?
1:46:26
When in the Peace Corps, I worked for the Forest Service in Niger, in West Africa.
1:46:32
Essentially, I worked for a government agency.
1:46:36
I was an employee essentially of a government agency; the
1:46:42
Department of Waters and Forests
1:46:45
in Niger.
1:46:47
My boss was basically a district ranger, and I was managing plantations, planting
1:46:53
trees, and managing planted trees for him.
1:46:57
So, that whole government worker side,
1:47:03
was one that I learned early on there.
1:47:07
You can still see the same
1:47:15
corporate culture, as it were, in the Forest Service, which
1:47:19
is not wholly dissimilar to the corporate culture in West Africa.
1:47:25
In fact, there are probably more similarities than
1:47:27
there are dissimilarities.
1:47:27
What country were you in?
1:47:30
I was in Niger, in West Africa, north of Nigeria.
1:47:34
It
1:47:38
was a government agency
1:47:47
that managed the forest there and it was under some difficult systems
1:47:53
that weren’t made any easier by an almost intractable bureaucracy.
1:48:00
I think the Forest Service is often ham-strung by its bureaucracy.
1:48:06
So, I can kind of empathize maybe a little with the agency.
1:48:13
One thing I’ve noticed about the “Andrews Days” [public and outreach event held
1:48:17
each year in June at HJA] is it seemed like a lot of undergraduates there.
1:48:19
Maybe it’s my perception as I’m getting older, but these people are there
1:48:21
working on projects with scientists.
1:48:22
Is that what is going on?
1:48:25
There is some interaction with undergraduates, but not as
1:48:37
a teacher?
1:48:39
Not in a classroom situation.
1:48:42
There is not teaching, there are teaching opportunities, per se, but summertime
1:48:47
is about research opportunities.
1:48:49
Experiential learning.
1:48:50
Yeah, right, and that’s good.
1:48:55
At Evergreen, I’m in a good position to kind of engender that, because students
1:48:58
can take not only summer contracts, but also fall, winter, and spring contracts,
1:49:04
where they can come and do research.
1:49:08
So, we might create research opportunities for undergraduates at
1:49:12
the Andrews like that for the future.
1:49:14
I’m anxious to engender that.
1:49:20
I think we can do more of that, where, for example, I have two,
1:49:27
three students, that were hired to work the summer at the Andrews.
1:49:32
We had a crew of nine, and three of them are from Evergreen.
1:49:36
Two of them are not only collecting data, but summarizing it, and they
1:49:42
have created a homepage for the project, and hopefully we will get a
1:49:48
Northwest Science publication out of it.
1:49:54
I think it’s great to have these opportunities for undergraduate
1:49:58
research, especially in a place like Evergreen, where graduate schools have
1:50:03
such difficulty with their transcripts that don’t have grades on them.
1:50:08
If they have a publication, even in something like Northwest Science, that
1:50:13
can just speak volumes for the potential of this student in graduate school.
1:50:22
It is interesting, your continuing involvement at the Andrews,
1:50:27
for this purpose.
1:50:28
There are other places, Wind River [Experimental Forest, southern Washington]
1:50:32
, for example, that bring students in.
1:50:32
Have you considered that?
1:50:32
Yeah.
1:50:34
That is a good
1:50:44
question.
1:50:45
I often ask myself why I haven’t been more involved there,
1:50:48
but I guess it’s because I’m
1:50:53
so closely affiliated with the Andrews and the facilities at the Andrews.
1:50:58
Wind River doesn’t have anything like
1:51:03
the apartments-complex at the
1:51:08
Andrews, and I’m not as closely tied with the research that’s going on there.
1:51:14
For a lot of reasons, the Andrews is becoming a center for
1:51:22
not only research, but also teaching throughout the Pacific Northwest.
1:51:28
Pack Forest is another one, which is much closer to Olympia, and
1:51:34
has a lot of stuff going on.
1:51:36
Pack Forest is the college forest for the University of Washington’s College
1:51:44
of Forest Resources.
1:51:44
But the facilities there are very expensive for
1:51:50
students.
1:51:52
A student pays five dollars a day at the Andrews, which is just dirt cheap, or
1:52:01
eighty dollars a month, something
1:52:07
like that.
1:52:07
That is really good.
1:52:09
I can bring down a class of students.
1:52:11
There are different possibilities.
1:52:12
I can either hire a cook to feed them, or I can have them feed themselves in a
1:52:19
central dining hall there, or they can fend for themselves in the apartments.
1:52:25
At Evergreen you’ve got vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores, and they
1:52:30
all have their own peculiarities.
1:52:32
It’s much easier to put the vegans in an apartment, the veggies
1:52:37
in another apartment, and the omnivores in another apartment, and
1:52:41
they can deal with it themselves.
1:52:42
So, the set-up is just perfect for that kind of thing there, and we just don’t
1:52:48
have that kind of opportunity elsewhere, so the facilities make it useful,
1:52:54
not to mention the ongoing research.
1:52:57
In the past, Art
1:53:01
always made himself available, I really appreciate it and try
1:53:04
not to take advantage of it.
1:53:06
He gives a great tour, knows every square inch of the Andrews, he’s
1:53:13
enthusiastic, and the students love him.
1:53:24
That’s a good thing.
1:53:26
Wind River had a lot of things, like the canopy crane and what not, but
1:53:35
I think I will continue to drag students down to the Andrews.
1:53:36
The reason I ask that question, is in my interview with Jerry Franklin,
1:53:36
he was talking about the difference between the Andrews and Wind River up
1:53:40
in Washington.
1:53:46
Oh yeah?
1:53:48
What did he say?
1:53:50
He says that dealing with University of Washington and
1:53:54
OSU is two different worlds.
1:53:57
He’s never felt like
1:54:11
he’s been able to replicate there anything close to the community spirit that
1:54:23
evolved on the Andrews, which is what you’re talking about, it sounds like.
1:54:23
There are positive aspects and there are things that are different
1:54:23
that he likes about it [Andrews]
1:54:23
. You went to Seattle and interviewed him, or he was down here?
1:54:25
He came down to Blue River, and we were out near the crane there
1:54:29
at Wind River, and the Forest Service-controlled forests there.
1:54:33
A Forest Service cabin right down on the river, not the river, but along a stream.
1:54:40
It was picturesque.
1:54:41
Well, that’s good.
1:54:42
He’s got a great perspective on the Andrews, and that is really
1:54:45
important that you interviewed him.
1:54:45
He is such a great character and such a great personality.
1:54:46
He was there when you were there?
1:54:46
Oh yeah.
1:55:06
Jerry Franklin and Dick Waring ran the IBP program in the early ‘70’s, and he
1:55:17
was there in the Forest Research Lab, so I guess he was here, that’s right.
1:55:23
Jerry was housed over here in this building [Corvallis FSL] . This part of
1:55:26
this building was just being built at that
1:55:31
time, but Jerry was housed over here, and then, much of the rest of IBP
1:55:37
was over in the FRL, the Forest Research Lab on Western Avenue.
1:55:40
That’s where Dick Waring was, and so much of the Andrews was
1:55:43
run out of the FRL over there.
1:55:45
Oh, I didn’t know that.
1:55:48
Yes.
1:55:48
That’s the hub, and I mean, Dick Waring, Chuck Grier, Steve Running,
1:55:55
Bill Emmingham, and I think even Art McKee had his office in
1:56:03
the Forest Research Lab on Western Avenue.
1:56:04
We were physically separated.
1:56:11
I didn’t personally come in contact with Jerry on a day-to-day basis,
1:56:16
except maybe when I was at the Andrews.
1:56:18
But when I was working in Corvallis, we were physically separated.
1:56:21
When
1:56:23
the Department of Forest Science [OSU] was created, we came together,
1:56:28
and then, the Andrews people came together in this building.
1:56:33
In the mid ‘70s, the Department of Forest Science [OSU] was
1:56:37
created, and that brought them
1:56:48
together in this building.
1:56:51
On
1:57:02
a day-to-day basis, you ran into these people.
1:57:05
That had something to do with it.
1:57:05
Finally, they are
1:57:12
building here, which is essentially bringing the FRL here.
1:57:16
At this point, all there is forest products out there;
1:57:19
there’s no forest science.
1:57:24
We were really lucky part of this building was vacant, and the college
1:57:28
was able to get space in the building.
1:57:32
I think that engendered a lot of synergism and esprit de corps.
1:57:38
That kind of brought the Forest Service and OSU together, the fact there
1:57:42
was space in this building to house the Department of Forest Science.
1:57:47
Yeah, that is interesting.
1:57:47
I didn’t know that.
1:57:47
There was a cooperative agreement announced that was drafted, and John
1:57:47
Gordon had a role, about ‘76 to ’78.
1:57:49
It got a critical mass of minds at one location, it was institutionalized,
1:57:50
it was place-centered, and it had a research outlet at the Andrews.
1:57:50
We are
1:58:26
nearly out of tape here and I don’t want to keep you here all afternoon.
1:58:28
Also, I don’t want you to think that this is the end of your
1:58:29
input if you have anything else.
1:58:33
I really encourage you to take a look at the book prospectus.
1:58:37
Especially the last part you said.
1:58:39
Well, you might take a look at this.
1:58:39
The book is roughly-organized chronologically.
1:58:39
One of the chapters is dealing with the IBP period in the 1970’s.
1:58:39
You might look at that one, and then the last two chapters, especially
1:58:40
the last chapter, which probably has strong relevance to what
1:58:45
you’re doing now.
1:58:58
But you might also think of some of the continuing things you talked about a
1:59:02
little bit, what draws people back to the Andrews after being away for a while.
1:59:07
One of the reasons why I wanted to interview you was to get into that, so,
1:59:07
if anything else occurs to you along those lines, feel free to drop me a note.
1:59:08
Actually, you talked fairly eloquently here today about it, so
1:59:20
I’m pleased I got a chance to talk to you.
1:59:22
It occurred to me after the summer you were going to be gone to Evergreen.
1:59:28
What was the book you mentioned?
1:59:30
Oh, it’s by Paul Hirt, H-I-R-T.
1:59:32
H-I-R-T.
1:59:34
It’s called Conspiracy of Optimism.
1:59:36
It’s a history of, I can’t remember the subtitle, but something to do with
1:59:46
Forest Service management in the West since World War II, ‘45 to
1:59:52
present.
1:59:53
But he talks a little bit in there, in the beginning chapters, about
1:59:56
traditions of the Forest Service, and how they were basically violated
1:59:57
after World War II, things they had really been pushed early on.
1:59:57
One of the things that happens in the Northwest is this Advisory Council
1:59:57
of Forests, and the PNW Station has a research advisory council that is
1:59:58
heavily dominated by the industry.
1:59:59
That’s one thing that obviously happened, but also, it’s
2:00:16
just
2:00:24
a
2:00:29
part of the culture of post-war America.
2:00:38
I wonder how people like Forsman were impacted by that.
2:00:39
And that was really one of the questions you gave.
2:00:39
I just don’t know.
2:00:39
Are
2:00:49
you going to interview him?
2:00:51
I plan on doing it.
2:00:52
I was going to put it off a little while.
2:00:54
There is a chapter in there where we’re focusing narrowly on
2:01:03
the old-growth issue.
2:01:03
I’ve never seen him at the Andrews.
2:01:03
Apparently, he goes there once in a while, but there is a lot of spotted
2:01:06
owl monitoring work done there.
2:01:09
The owl folks have a presence there, although he himself does not.
2:01:14
He’s really kind of kept to himself.
2:01:17
God,
2:01:21
he’s shook things up.
2:01:25
And his Ph.D. thesis, which became an Ecological Monographs monologue,
2:01:27
I mean, brought down the “house of cards.” Changed everything.
2:01:27
Of course, he
2:01:30
was here
2:01:41
all through the scramble, and his name is well known in the public realm.
2:01:49
One of the things that U.S. forestry does is name recognition,
2:01:54
which can work against you, too.
2:01:54
People will automatically pigeon-hole you in this camp or that camp.
2:01:54
Whereas, what you’re doing right now with this second-growth land management,
2:01:54
is not as easy to pigeon hole.
2:01:56
Right,
2:02:11
that’s true.
2:02:11
I’ve benefited from that, too, and I’d rather not be in a particular
2:02:15
camp, although being at Evergreen, it is almost unavoidable.
2:02:19
People think that I’m a particular way.
2:02:22
If you’re at Evergreen and advocating that Evergreen consider cutting down
2:02:28
some trees, [chuckles] it’s different.
2:02:37
The name Forsman comes up among environmentalists at
2:02:40
Evergreen, and they just put him
2:02:45
on a pedestal and call him a saint.
2:02:48
I wonder how difficult it was for him to operate within the Forest Service,
2:02:53
and how much flack he must have gotten.
2:02:57
I
2:03:01
just don’t know.
2:03:02
I’ve never talked to him about it.
2:03:02
I’ve run into him a few times at the LTER when the PNW Station
2:03:02
Director came down to visit, and he was there giving a presentation.
2:03:02
But, it strikes me, his situation is similar to Wallmo.
2:03:02
Who?
2:03:02
Charlie Wallmo, the guy who did the deer research up in near Juneau, Alaska.
2:03:02
This is about the time you were down here as an undergraduate.
2:03:02
In the late ‘70’s, mid-to-late ‘70’s, he was up there blowing holes in the
2:03:02
myth about creating habitat for deer by clear-cutting southeastern Alaskan forest.
2:03:02
He died not too long after the controversy blew up in their
2:03:13
face.
2:03:13
Ted Dyrness was in here the other day,
2:03:46
saying
2:03:49
how he’s convinced that it was, because he was up at Fairbanks at that time,
2:03:59
that it was the reaction against him,
2:04:13
that killed him.
2:04:14
It was just intense pressure from the PNW Station as well as the
2:04:14
region [– Pacific Northwest Region of the Forest Service] up there.
2:04:14
The pressures and his temperament didn’t match.
