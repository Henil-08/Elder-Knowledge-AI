00:23
How much do you know of what I’m working on here?
00:27
I don’t remember exactly, but I read what you were trying to do for
00:34
the history project, to find out why people came in, and various philosophies
00:38
of the Andrews and why they got out.
00:42
Good.
00:42
Yeah.
00:42
I guess that’s not too far from the main theme.
00:45
Yeah, that’s the main thrust.
00:47
What we’re trying to do is a history of the science and community out there.
00:52
I want to look at not just the history of the Andrews Forest, but also the
00:56
group of scientists that were involved.
01:00
Sure.
01:00
To get started, I understand that you joined the OSU faculty about
01:06
1963 out of UC [University of California]-Berkeley, is that right?
01:11
Uh-huh.
01:11
Maybe you could discuss the origins of your decision to come to OSU at that point
01:16
and your academic career at that time.
01:19
I had a background in forestry at University of Minnesota,
01:26
both a B.S. and master’s degree.
01:28
And got accepted to go to either the University of Michigan with
01:33
Stephen Spurr or to go to Davis [University of California-Davis].
01:39
Spurr became president of the University of Texas, so I went to
01:44
Berkeley rather than Davis because I could actually teach in the forestry
01:48
school, and get a Ph.D. in botany and physiology with a minor in soils.
01:55
When I graduated, there were a number of jobs, and this was the one that was
02:01
initially full-time research, but with a potential to fuse the Forest Research
02:07
Lab with the College of Forestry, at that time the School of Forestry [UC-Berkeley]
02:11
, so that you could have some teaching, at least, at the graduate level.
02:20
There weren’t any jobs compared to today, so this was one of
02:24
the better jobs to start out at.
02:28
Were you from Minnesota?
02:30
No, I was born in Chicago.
02:33
But my wife is from Minnesota.
02:35
And there were no forestry schools at that time other than Minnesota, in the Midwest.
02:41
There wasn’t any in Illinois.
02:43
I don’t think there was any in Wisconsin.
02:46
So, I guess I could have gone to Michigan.
02:50
We used to vacation and go for canoe trips in Wisconsin and up in Minnesota.
02:55
I had contacts through the scouts.
02:57
And through my father’s business contacts, I
03:02
knew a guy named Hubachek , who had purchased land as a Chicago lawyer
03:10
and then dedicated it to research.
03:14
So
03:17
I started out as a young lad right out of high school, met all these
03:21
scientists and started doing science.
03:23
Then when I started forestry school that fall, I already knew
03:27
lots of Latin names of plants.
03:29
So, I had already started into research.
03:32
I came out West in ‘55, and worked in Idaho for the [U.S.] Forest Service.
03:39
What did you do in that?
03:40
I was on a study with Don Leephart and our job was to look at pine roots and
03:46
see historically whether trees that were on droughty sites had more damage
03:51
that might account for their dying back.
03:54
We created artificial drought by building big platforms and trying
03:58
to shed all the rain and snow off of these platforms onto the ditches.
04:03
So, it was my first experimental manipulation, almost my last.
04:07
[Chuckles]
04:08
Why was that?
04:08
Hard work!
04:10
Digging in rock, putting up platforms.
04:14
Right.
04:14
I started out in the Siskiyous in southern Oregon, probably the most
04:18
complex forest system in terms of vegetation and soils, certainly in the
04:26
West and possibly in the U.S. At that time, we had about seven years down
04:36
there to develop techniques that gave us a measure of what we thought was the
04:41
effective environment for the plants.
04:43
Rather describing what slopes they’re on and what elevation and what kind of soils
04:49
and that, we started to use physiological measures of drought, and physiological
04:54
measures of availability of nutrients.
04:58
That was a new framework for forestry research, and was the basis that we
05:06
thought might be able to move from different areas to make comparisons and
05:10
to model not only distribution of plants, but also the growth of plants, at that
05:16
time in forestry, that was the key thing.
05:20
So, I started to do a little bit of work on the Andrews on the east
05:24
side [of Willamette Valley] as I was moving out of the Siskiyous,
05:28
and I was also beginning to be very interested in the idea of modeling.
05:33
About that time,
05:38
just about when I’m getting tenure, at seven years, the International
05:43
Biological Program [IBP] had started.
05:44
We had a conference at the University of Washington-Seattle.
05:47
Jerry Franklin was there and others, and we had to debate if we were
05:51
going to be a part of this, and where were we going to do the research.
05:55
Two big choices were either McDonald Forest or the Andrews.
05:59
The Andrews was the only place then that had a few wildlife studies,
06:05
particularly pens where they were keeping out birds and rodents and
06:11
were looking at the seed mortality, and they also had gauged watersheds.
06:16
And you
06:22
had some control over where and when it was logged.
06:25
Whereas at McDonald Forest, it was more market-driven when
06:28
there was an opportunity to log.
06:29
So, it was much more difficult to control an experiment on McDonald
06:35
Forest than the Andrews, even though the Andrews was much further away and
06:40
on federal land.
06:40
In 1969 we wrote the first sub-proposal to go into this large
06:46
IBP project with the University of Washington and other universities.
06:51
We had the University of Washington lead it, and we were the next
06:56
principle, I guess you would say.
07:01
Over the next five years, we developed different philosophies
07:05
than the University of Washington.
07:07
They kept the motif of professors and graduate students, and never really
07:13
developed, except in oceanography and stream work, a philosophy that
07:19
brought new people in that could be post-docs that could cross fields.
07:24
We actually
07:27
reduced our commitments to full professors and graduate students,
07:31
actually took them out of the program.
07:35
Not maybe the wisest thing to do as a young associate professor, but we did it.
07:40
We brought in people that had a background from other fields.
07:45
This includes Fred Swanson, Kermit Cromack, eventually Jim
07:54
Sedell, and at the very tail end, also Stan Gregory, in terms of graduate
08:01
students that came after the IBP and got an appointment as an assistant
08:05
professor in fish and wildlife.
08:09
Now, what the rationale for that?
08:10
The rationale is that we needed the full-time commitment of people that
08:14
already had a degree because we were doing field projects and lots of workshops.
08:19
And we couldn’t do it with graduate students, and the professors weren’t able
08:24
to make this leap of commitment to learn these new fields and to integrate them.
08:33
So we assigned that to the post-docs, and usually that was a
08:36
person who had a master’s degree or was getting a master’s degree.
08:40
There’s quite a bit of resources with the responsibility.
08:43
It wasn’t just, “You have to do this.” It was like, “You have to do this,
08:47
but here are the resources to do
08:52
it.” Phil Sollins also was one of these.
08:56
At that time we could see jobs on the horizon either at the Forest Service
09:00
or at the university [OSU] , so we didn’t feel guilty about exploiting
09:03
the talents of people from other fields when you could see that there
09:07
was an opportunity to move them into classically forestry enterprises where
09:11
you had to have a degree in forestry, otherwise you wouldn’t be accepted.
09:14
We broke that convention at that time, big time.
09:20
We did it!
09:22
And it made a large difference because we began to look at
09:25
decomposition as a process, independent growth, and how the whole system
09:32
was put together.
09:33
There were certain difficulties.
09:36
One was developing things before the models were in place.
09:40
And the modelers were trying to get data from graduate students and professors
09:44
who weren’t ready to give it up, either because they weren’t sure it was
09:47
okay, or they weren’t sure they should release it to these people and not know
09:51
what they were going to do with it.
09:53
So, these very elaborate models turned out to be basically usable
10:00
only on a few sites where you had all the data to drive it, and then
10:03
basically described what we measured.
10:05
They weren’t dynamic in the sense of what happens when the climate
10:09
changes or what happens when we cut the forest or something like that.
10:14
About five years through that,
10:18
I became very interested, at least in looking ahead in two ways.
10:23
One is how do you extend these models so they could be used to study clearcutting
10:30
of Watershed 10, which we were going to do, and make predictions on hydrology.
10:35
The easiest thing we could do is to see what kind of process models we
10:40
had in hydrology, which is the most physical-based and least biological-based
10:44
of all the processes that go on in watersheds and in ecosystems.
10:51
We linked up with people in Coweeta [USFS experimental forest and IBP/LTER site]
10:53
and Wayne Swank, who also got his Ph.
10:55
D. from University of Washington, so we knew that.
10:59
And we developed a general model that we could test in Arizona, Oregon, and North
11:08
Carolina [where Coweeta is located; near Georgia border] . That was published
11:10
actually as the major synthesis out of
11:19
this book here.
11:21
Along with it, the University of Washington had a series of people,
11:26
Dale Cole in particular, that put together the nutrient-cycling balances
11:30
of not just Oregon and Washington.
11:33
This is the premier first attempt to actually show generalities among biomes
11:40
and to put them into quantitative models that were generally based on processes
11:47
rather than statistical correlations.
11:50
Until then, almost all the watershed models were tuned to
11:53
how much water flowed out and how much came into paired watersheds.
11:57
You couldn’t extrapolate them.
12:02
That was quite a refreshing
12:06
insight that perhaps this was an opportunity to go
12:10
further in this direction.
12:14
So this was in 1981?
12:16
Yeah.
12:16
So, I personally began to look for more ways to do experiments to
12:21
test hypotheses that would allow us to have fundamental models.
12:25
At that time it meant taking another sabbatical to Europe and
12:30
working with Paul Jarvis, who we’d brought over also into Seattle at
12:35
the tail end of the IBP projects.
12:39
We started using radioisotopes, not the stabilized stuff, in order to
12:43
quantify the estimates of fluxes through trees, soils and the system.
12:49
That worked out, although we started on the Andrews and a little
12:54
bit up at the Washington site.
12:57
We really wanted to test these broadly.
13:02
The disadvantage of the Andrews is that it’s basically a spot.
13:07
If you were to generalize anything from there about
13:09
drought, you hardly have drought.
13:10
If you were to generalize about heavy winter snow-packs where you have
13:13
permafrost, there’s no permafrost.
13:15
So, it isn’t inadequate for many things, but it’s perfectly inadequate
13:20
for reaching generalized models.
13:23
It’s a great spot,
13:27
but it has limits.
13:28
In 1982, actually earlier than that, it was in the ‘70s, one of my graduate
13:33
students, Henry Gholz, had gotten funding to work on the Andrews, but his Ph.
13:38
D. studied a gradient that goes from the Oregon Coast to the juniper
13:43
woodlands [Central Oregon] , that’s called the Oregon Transect.
13:46
That had all the variation in production that exists in the forests in North
13:53
America, in just 250 kilometers.
13:57
Since then, there’s been 50-60 publications, including major
14:07
projects that NASA has sponsored.
14:11
And to run those projects, you have to have somebody fully dedicated,
14:16
just like you did for the IBP, for something like a five-year period.
14:22
I guess
14:26
my abilities run toward projects that have a beginning and an end.
14:31
I’ll do anything for five years involving up to a hundred people.
14:36
But, I won’t do it for life because I can’t see how to finish these
14:41
things up, do the synthesis, and then go on my learning curve about
14:45
how to scale or do things further.
14:47
So, every five years or so, I’m about ready to take a break.
14:51
It was about ten years, actually, on the IBP, but then
14:54
it transferred into the LTER.
14:57
We wrote the cover grants, Jerry Franklin, and I think, Fred Swanson,
15:01
may have been on the first one, to make sure there was a continuity.
15:06
And we knew that things were going to change, the perspectives and
15:10
the focus and the applications.
15:12
But we thought it was in good hands.
15:14
And I think it was.
15:19
Your primary position in the group started somewhere in the
15:23
mid-sixties with the IBP, and then extended through the late seventies?
15:28
That’s right.
15:29
It went, certainly through the late seventies.
15:31
This book came out in ’81, so that’s still involved in ‘80.
15:37
I wrote the first rough draft before I went on sabbatical in
15:40
‘69, so that’s about ten years.
15:49
What was your perception at that time of the site that is
15:57
the Andrews?
15:57
Do you recall first impressions of the people working there at that time?
16:03
I thought it had a lot of potential because it had a
16:05
road system and it had control.
16:09
The McDonald Forest had a road system, but not the control.
16:12
It had the gauged watershed, so you already knew what the runoff was, but what
16:16
you didn’t know was how to predict it.
16:19
So that’s an opportunity.
16:21
I thought most of the people that started out were highly descriptive.
16:25
I
16:27
started from that same vein in soils and botany, but as I moved
16:33
around at three different regions, Minnesota, California and Oregon, I
16:38
realized that you had to generalize and you had to scale differently.
16:42
So, I began to look for these common properties that work everywhere.
16:46
And anything we did on the Andrews we hoped would fit in everywhere
16:51
else, but it was just a point.
16:54
At that point, the Andrews was basically one site of many you were involved with.
16:57
Right.
16:57
I couldn’t do that because I was involved 80 hours a week holding up everybody
17:02
and trying to keep the money flowing.
17:04
I was the flight director.
17:09
We’d cut up the budget each year with the University of Washington.
17:13
It was a tremendous amount of administration.
17:17
I was going to ask you, were you involved in 1968 with a meeting at the
17:24
University of Washington with you and Jerry Franklin and, who was it, Dale Cole?
17:31
Dale Cole and Stan Gessel.
17:36
That was concerning the establishment of the project, right?
17:40
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your reflection on that
17:42
meeting and what your concerns were.
17:45
I think concerns that people who attended it had, outside the University
17:49
of Washington, is that it looked like everything was going to start
17:52
at the University of Washington.
17:53
Maybe, maybe not, but there wouldn’t be much off-site.
17:58
We thought there were some good people at the University of Washington.
18:00
I had close friends in physiology and they had really excellent work going on.
18:07
But, we didn’t think it was wide enough to really develop these models.
18:11
So, there was certainly a concern about organizing very quickly to
18:18
have more balance.
18:21
And I don’t think there was a tremendous
18:27
uproar about not allowing that to happen.
18:30
I mean it was difficult, because we had all kinds of
18:32
university representatives there.
18:35
So, we couldn’t have ten sites fully supported; we might have
18:39
one-and-a-half, and we were the half.
18:42
There were sites also in Alaska, individual little stations where
18:47
people worked on making a few measurements and trying to coordinate.
18:50
But we didn’t have the resources to do everything at the same time,
18:54
without quite knowing how models were going to work and before we knew
18:59
what measurements should be made.
19:00
So then the concern was one of institutional involvement or was it
19:06
more a concern of where the program would go if you weren’t involved in it?
19:11
I think we wanted to be involved in it because we were interested
19:14
in modeling ecosystems.
19:16
And to be fully involved in it, at that time, we thought
19:22
we had to have a site nearby.
19:26
You’ll find now the world has changed, that you can have these
19:29
large projects and you can pull people together for three years.
19:33
You can put them anywhere in the world; Bora Bora, Amazon basin.
19:40
That wasn’t an opportunity during those days.
19:43
It wasn’t just because we didn’t have, we did have airplanes, but we didn’t have
19:47
the electronic communications and network setup, where other sites, not the LTER
19:54
kind of network, but other more permanent sites, were available for us to move in.
19:57
Other than the Forest Service research stations, most of those just had a
20:03
station, and a building, and we visited a lot of those and used them, but
20:09
they didn’t have the cadre of people around to really do the research.
20:15
The great advantage of the IBP, was we did reach out and with people and
20:21
with other biomes, particularly the tundra and eastern deciduous biome
20:28
people working in decomposition and water and carbon-cycling.
20:32
We would link up with those because we needed each other to see the
20:36
methods, and that really brought us together across the country.
20:40
But more at meetings, rather than actually going to each
20:45
other’s site and gathering data.
20:47
You became aware of what other people were doing but you weren’t
20:49
directly involved in the curriculum?
20:51
Well, except in writing up the synthesis.
21:07
My understanding is there were some concerns around 1962-63, somewhere
21:10
in there, about the possible closure of the Andrews by the Forest Service.
21:13
Do you recall anything along those lines and how people responded to that?
21:18
Well, I think that was because they thought they had done all
21:20
the research they needed once they demonstrated that you could do
21:26
cable-logging.
21:28
Uh-huh.
21:28
Because that was the big thing, to get away from clearcutting
21:33
with roads everywhere.
21:35
They demonstrated that, and also, I think they had success partly from the
21:41
Forest Research Lab work, and partly from regeneration specialists with the Forest
21:45
Service in getting seedlings to grow.
21:47
Before, they were dumping seed on the ground and rodents were eating it.
21:51
So, they said, “We solved the problems of getting regeneration back, and of
21:58
getting roads that don’t immediately erode when we take the timber off.”
22:06
I think was part of it, and it is expensive research, the monitoring
22:10
of water quality and water flow.
22:13
It got a lot more expensive [Chuckle].
22:16
Was there a shift in focus from what was expected?
22:21
Well, I don’t think the Forest Service had fully decided to close this experimental
22:27
forest [Andrews] . Then we came in.
22:29
I think they were concerned about the investment and return, now that
22:33
some products would come off of it.
22:36
We actually took advantage of that by saying, “Well, what you’re doing is fine.
22:40
We can build on top of that and if you keep it open, everyone
22:43
will benefit.” Ever since,
22:47
that’s been the relationship between the U.S. Forest Service
22:50
here and the university [Oregon State] , and I think most people
22:53
would say that everyone benefits.
22:57
At that point, you took the risk before the IBP was established, so
23:01
that the university was just concerned with it as a possible research site?
23:05
That’s right.
23:05
Just as a research site.
23:07
And I knew Ted Dyrness and Jerry Franklin, back when I came.
23:16
They told me they were trying to recruit people down there.
23:18
Yeah.
23:18
It’s been a long relationship.
23:22
I was working up in Cougar Creek, which is
23:27
one of the drainages that goes into the McKenzie, and making measurements
23:34
of climate and tree growth in clear-cuts and non-clear-cuts.
23:39
So, it was not too far away from the Andrews already.
23:42
Cougar Creek is up the McKenzie a little ways?
23:42
It’s
23:45
just a drainage near the Cougar Reservoir
23:49
before Cougar Reservoir existed.
23:51
Okay.
23:52
You all
23:54
were interested in the general area.
23:56
Sure.
23:56
Sure.
23:57
Because I wanted to extend the principles and the ideas that we
24:00
started in the Siskiyous, to see
24:05
whether we could generalize them.
24:07
At the time just prior to you being established at Andrews,
24:09
what was the degree of interaction between your OSU colleagues and
24:13
the Forest Service scientists?
24:15
Oh, one-on-one.
24:18
I had a fishing buddy over there.
24:21
We were really good friends, we reviewed each other’s
24:24
manuscripts, that kind of thing.
24:26
But there wasn’t any formal arrangement for seminars and there wasn’t any
24:30
formal attempt for project leaders to involve the University, or vice versa.
24:36
Who was your contact?
24:38
Ken Krueger was my friend.
24:41
He died very young.
24:43
And then Jerry Franklin.
24:44
But Ken Krueger was a physiologist, and so that was my closest link.
24:50
I knew Eileen Boyce.
24:51
I knew a lot of people
24:55
over there, but I was interested in research.
24:57
We were full-time research.
24:58
We didn’t want to completely duplicate what they did on the
25:02
same place so we would communicate.
25:06
But, I don’t remember graduate students being trained.
25:08
There may have been a few; mostly technicians at that
25:12
time in both our shops.
25:15
I had one graduate student, maybe two or three, in those first seven years.
25:22
One was Bill Emmingham.
25:23
Another one was Brian Cleary.
25:25
Who would have been
25:35
a founder of the core HJA projects?
25:36
Jack Rothacher?
25:36
Yeah, he was there.
25:40
And Richard Fredriksen was their hydrologist, so I obviously knew him.
25:42
I was also curious, at that time, did that strike you as
25:48
unusual degree or a different type of interaction than
25:56
other places you had been?
25:58
At [University of] Minnesota they had an experiment station upstairs in the
26:03
same building as the forestry building.
26:05
So, I had worked for those people in the summer, so no,
26:08
it didn’t strike me as unusual.
26:10
I was used to that kind of relationship.
26:13
I worked for the Forest Service at least two summers, so
26:19
I highly approved of it.
26:20
So, it was something you’d kind of come to expect by the time you got here?
26:23
Right.
26:24
Also, in my Ph.
26:25
D., I worked with three other professors and three other graduate students on
26:29
a joint project in the redwood region.
26:31
So, I already knew, both the tremendous benefits and also some of the problems
26:36
that arise in joint research, where everybody else, even though you help
26:41
them, data doesn’t come when you need it.
26:43
That kind of thing.
26:44
Usually three-quarters of it works out, and three-quarters
26:47
is a pretty good investment.
26:49
Usually one quarter does not.
26:51
And that shouldn’t surprise you.
26:53
I mean, once you recognize those averages as what you should expect
26:58
under the best of conditions, then you can live with them.
27:00
Or not live with them.
27:02
The biggest hurdles were coordination of the work, not necessarily
27:06
the institutional differences?
27:07
Yes, and people.
27:09
I mean, people are the biggest opportunity, and the biggest problem.
27:16
Because, if you can’t get the personalities to match, you
27:17
can’t very well send them out and expect them to get much work done.
27:21
We’d have people saying, “We collected it, or we’re still collecting it.”
27:25
And the other people would say, “Well, they haven’t given it to us yet.” Then,
27:27
pretty soon you have to figure out a way to replace both those people.
27:34
Any examples of that?
27:36
We had some tremendous people climbing trees, studying
27:39
lichens and growth and all that.
27:41
Then we had people down on the ground waiting for branches to come down
27:44
and to do the elementary analyses, and they weren’t coming down.
27:47
Actually, the people doing the tremendous work on lichens, overran
27:51
their budget by $10,000 a year.
27:53
Then the department head wouldn’t back them up.
27:55
So, you’re looking at how to solve the problem, not how to create more of it.
28:03
You could find a graduate student and try to save that person and get the
28:08
work done, and put the post-docs to do the other things, and it all works out.
28:13
But, you just can’t have two professors blaming one another and having
28:18
their students caught in-between.
28:20
And of course, the product isn’t coming out that you need for the models.
28:24
Somebody’s gotta move, and I never had any problems moving.
28:31
I tend to have very short meetings with a very short agenda.
28:36
You come, you know what you’re doing, then that is great.
28:39
Then you can have a long meeting.
28:40
I can’t keep my attention on all the possible things that come up in a long
28:43
meeting, so I don’t have long meetings.
28:46
Lots of other people like long meetings, and do very well at them.
28:50
But I don’t go to them, because I can’t focus on all of it.
28:55
I can’t integrate in my mind where to move next, what consensus we have, if it’s
29:00
basically a long, wide-open discussion.
29:04
I like wide-open discussions, but I don’t call meetings for those.
29:08
I’ll have a workshop in the evenings, something like that.
29:12
I have a different philosophy
29:15
that I’ve lived with.
29:16
It works for me great.
29:18
It sure gets a lot done in a short time, and most of the people I
29:22
work with are highly productive.
29:25
You can sometimes sense that this is really hard to do with a huge group.
29:30
You need to break them into groups of five and ten people, and have
29:34
them reach a consensus, come with their reports, and have a decision.
29:38
Because you’re shifting money from one budget to another that time,
29:42
or from a joint venture, or from a small pool of money, into that.
29:47
We made some really hard decisions in switching away from forestry kind of
29:51
things over into the stream group, because we thought they had more exciting things
29:55
to do with the money, and we shifted it.
30:00
When you say we, was there a
30:01
-- -- Jerry Franklin and I.
30:02
Oh.
30:02
Okay.
30:03
Sat down together
30:04
-- -- With a huge crowd of twenty people in the room, it’s not
30:07
-- Okay.
30:08
-- but they would come in, present their reasons why they needed this.
30:11
We would look for alternatives.
30:13
We would have the meeting,
30:16
hear the alternatives, make the decisions, and commit the
30:24
money.
30:24
I suppose it still happens today on the small projects of three to five people.
30:28
But once you get up to a hundred people or something like
30:31
that, it’s very, very hard to
30:36
do that.
30:36
There were a lot of people there.
30:38
Yeah, but we still reached these kinds of decisions.
30:39
Of course, there was an
30:43
end in sight.
30:44
There was an end in sight, right.
30:45
Also, there was a sort of crisis, if we don't do this then, we
30:49
can’t go to the national meeting, we can’t renew the grant, etc.
30:50
Right.
30:50
I mean, we
30:54
had to show what we were doing.
30:55
They came out and reviewed our work because these were big grants, a million
30:59
dollars a year, back in the sixties.
31:00
A year?
31:02
[Chuckles]
31:02
Yeah.
31:04
When people were being paid $12,000 a year full-time as an assistant professor
31:09
Yeah, right.
31:10
So, you got a lot and had almost no overhead.
31:13
I mean, a very small overhead.
31:14
So it was the kind of thing, they’d come out here, and they talked, in fact,
31:20
we wanted them to talk to the graduate students and talk to the post-docs to see
31:24
how each one fit into the larger project.
31:27
That’s what we’d been working on, how they fit into the larger project,
31:30
so they knew why this was important, before something that might be on
31:34
their thesis came up as important.
31:36
So they could explain that to the NSF reviewers.
31:40
That wasn’t true at the University of Washington.
31:43
Is that right?
31:43
Yeah, because they didn’t have the structure to really
31:48
encourage that to happen.
31:49
It took a big, big plan.
31:51
I said in this one little paper published, an internal thing in the Coniferous
32:00
Forest Biome pubs, about integration.
32:05
“The most valuable product of the International Biological Program in the
32:08
United States will not be the systems models that will aid making decisions
32:12
concerning land and water management, but training people that will bridge the
32:15
communication gap between disciplines and institutions.” It’s not exactly profound,
32:20
and there wasn’t necessarily a consensus with the University of Washington.
32:27
I think
32:31
he was a post-doc at University of Washington, and I was an
32:34
associate professor here.
32:38
We got it in writing,
32:41
looking at the organization of the
32:45
biome as a system, the actual organization of it.
32:50
Whether or not it’s an honest interpretation, history will judge that.
32:55
That’s what we put out at that time so people could see
32:58
how the thing was organized.
32:59
Obviously,
33:02
there’s some political sensitivity in trying to not create big
33:07
waves, because we were different.
33:09
They had post-docs at the University of Washington, but they didn’t assign
33:12
them the same responsibility we did.
33:14
Or where they did, they couldn’t seem to get the data when they needed it.
33:18
Sometimes, it’s people again.
33:19
Sometimes it’s the post-docs that were involved, although not anything
33:22
is wrong with the professors.
33:28
So, in general terms, your perception is that the University of Washington
33:33
program was a little bit less efficient, at least, in reaching
33:35
these goals that IBP had laid out?
33:38
If they did reach it, they reached it in a different way.
33:41
A lot of things came after the IBP.
33:45
Because there were still data-sets, and sometimes some
33:48
really sad things would happen.
33:50
A very young and good graduate student would die.
33:54
The thesis would barely be in the form that you could extract anything from it.
34:01
You can’t blame the University of Washington when a graduate
34:04
student dies, one that has a big responsibility for the program.
34:07
It wasn’t a post-doc.
34:09
That’s one of the reasons why we brought Paul Jarvis over as a
34:12
professor to see if he could help us pull these pieces together.
34:16
And he did.
34:17
So, as long as you had alternatives and you could make the decision in a hurry,
34:24
then you could usually solve the problem.
34:26
But you had to have money and you had to be able to make the decisions.
34:28
But if you didn’t have money and you couldn’t make decisions, well, then,
34:31
basically, you couldn’t succeed.
34:33
So the difference would be that you might have a post-doc who might die,
34:36
but if you could replace him right away.
34:37
Right.
34:37
[Chuckles]
34:37
I see.
34:39
Okay.
34:39
Or they’d have more than one person that knew how that stuff fit in.
34:43
We failed, too.
34:44
We tried and tried with some of the wildlife people to get it together, and
34:48
we didn’t have a good enough feeling of how the role of wildlife in the
34:54
forest really fit in, because we were just studying undisturbed forests.
34:58
Most of the role of wildlife is in what happens after the disturbance, in terms
35:04
of how quickly these animals and insects
35:12
speed up recolonization of the system once it’s been really disturbed.
35:16
You look at the disturbed conditions, they’re hardly eating anything.
35:19
I mean they’re keeping alive, the system is supporting them.
35:23
But, what are they doing?
35:25
Until we started looking at disturbance, and insect outbreaks and disease
35:30
outbreaks, as mechanisms to reset the system, help cycle nutrients
35:33
more efficiently, and bring the thing back up to a standard that had been
35:38
sinking into a very-stressed state, we couldn’t really see the role.
35:43
And that’s not the wildlife people’s fault.
35:46
They were trapping animals, looking where they lived, and finding out the
35:49
gradients and densities of animals.
35:51
That was great stuff.
35:51
But we couldn’t really quantify, until much, much later, some
35:57
of the roles that they played.
35:58
I’m sure all the wildlife studies were one of the reasons the Andrews was selected.
36:03
Right, but those studies were almost done.
36:07
They still had the fences up and you still could see they were working,
36:09
but they were already being published.
36:11
They had the actual experiments on the ground so you could say there was a
36:14
history of experimentation, weirs and sites where people had manipulated the
36:19
access to seeds by birds and mammals.
36:23
Both of
36:27
them noted the lack of wildlife studies since the IBP days.
36:34
Well, maybe since the
36:38
IBP days, yeah.
36:41
There was an
36:46
NSF inspection that took place in 1971, I understand, where they
36:51
came out and evaluated the program.
36:55
Can you recall those inspection tours?
36:58
Apparently, that took place every year, right?
37:00
If I’m not mistaken.
37:01
It was certainly every other year.
37:04
I’m not sure it was every year.
37:08
When was it?
37:08
‘71?
37:08
What I’ve got here says 1971.
37:13
I’m just curious how the group responded to that, if there was a group response
37:17
to how those sessions were conducted, and what the product of them was.
37:25
We had a series of them.
37:28
The two most important, I can’t remember the exact years, would be where the NSF
37:34
people would be asking, as they walk through the woods, people next to them,
37:42
how the whole thing fit in terms of the arrangements and how things were working.
37:49
One of the things that we did to improve our chances of actually having
37:57
an integrated program, is we would go out ahead of time with a group
38:02
and we would first listen to their stories, and then, we practiced it.
38:07
And to make more fun out of it, we would tell each other’s stories.
38:12
So, I might tell the stream story, and Jim Sedell would talk about how water
38:17
moves up trees, or something like this.
38:18
But we knew enough of the story to be dangerous.
38:23
Well, when Jerry and I are writing the final reports each year, this experience
38:28
is invaluable, because this allows us to write in the same style with the same
38:34
major “hits.” We’d look for important “hits,” meaning linkages between programs
38:39
and ideas, and on the field trips we’d actually have, “Oh, let’s do it this way.
38:44
Let’s put this chemical in and turn this thing green, and make
38:47
these rocks look like chlorophyll.
38:49
Let’s do it, and now let’s go from this series to here.” We actually figure
38:54
out the most reasonable thing to do.
38:58
We would start at the bottom of a watershed and walk the people up, when
39:01
we should have taken some of the older people to the top and walked them down,
39:04
because they were very, very tired and not too happy [chuckles] in cases
39:08
where we walked them up and around, which is a 45- minute trail, minimum.
39:12
It’s a long, 25-acre watershed, and it’s steep.
39:16
[Watershed 10 - HJA EF]
39:17
The people on that committee would be senior scientists from back East?
39:21
Well, they would be from all over, including other biomes.
39:23
Okay.
39:24
But, we had already been reviewing some and we had workshops.
39:28
But, there would also be some senior administrators from NSF.
39:31
This is a huge amount of money, line itemed by Congress to NSF for these
39:37
things, and most people didn’t think it was going to be a good investment.
39:42
At the end of it, I think most of the reviews would say
39:45
it wasn’t a good investment.
39:46
Is that right?
39:47
Yeah.
39:47
Very, very few positive things about it, measuring everything, rushing back and
39:52
forth, and the models are too complex.
39:56
I mean, all of that’s true, okay?
39:59
It’s only when you look at the legacy of the next generation, and how they
40:04
were able to better integrate and see across the systems and begin to see
40:08
applications where other people didn’t, then you could really evaluate it.
40:13
It’s sort of like bringing up kids.
40:14
I mean, you’re not sure when they’re in high school whether
40:15
you want them to grow up.
40:17
[Chuckles] But you better wait a while, because you have a big investment.
40:21
Another decade later, then you begin to make your judgments.
40:24
The criticism came from one NSF director or from
40:27
--? No.
40:28
They had independent reviewers
40:31
doing these things.
40:32
They just couldn’t see for the money spent that we had advanced our understandings.
40:36
The models were oversold.
40:39
The computer systems weren’t able to handle all this.
40:41
The stuff was not well-documented, I mean, in huge data banks.
40:47
Think about all these people trying to get this stuff in different formats.
40:51
And our big concern was to get just enough so we could see how the pieces
40:55
fit together and get something out.
40:57
We even started with these gray literature things.
41:00
Lots and lots of gray literature.
41:02
Well, that doesn’t count in the scientific establishment.
41:05
Particularly, it doesn’t count when the precursors to the IBP in the United States
41:11
were the watersheds at Hubbard Brook.
41:13
Everything that was published in science was very, very carefully done
41:18
by a group of very fine scientists – Bormann and Likens and some very
41:22
good graduate students, but not too many, and over quite a long time.
41:28
That’s the standard and here, all these people are practically trying to do it.
41:32
You’re not going to do as well with that kind of thing.
41:35
On the other hand, the training, the other perspectives and cross-fertilization
41:40
of ideas, made a difference in our lives, because we were able to travel
41:43
to Hubbard Brook, travel to Coweeta, and see these things, and meet young people
41:49
who were coming up the career ladder.
41:51
So, you have these more collegial relationships than you would
41:55
normally have in those days.
41:59
Good and bad.
42:01
[Chuckle]
42:01
In about 1970 or ’71,
42:07
you were involved in a decision to hire Art McKee, I understand.
42:11
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations
42:13
of Art’s role at the Andrews?
42:16
Originally, he was hired to be the local site coordinator, or director.
42:21
I guess I was supposed to be the site director, so he must
42:23
have had a different name.
42:25
What was your title officially?
42:26
Site Director.
42:27
Site Director.
42:27
Of the Oregon site.
42:30
Oh, Okay.
42:30
And I was stationed in Corvallis.
42:32
Art initially was stationed in the Andrews, so he must have
42:35
been the site coordinator.
42:36
I think that’s right.
42:37
He must have had a different
42:40
title.
42:41
I liked the idea he’d come from another part of the country, so that
42:46
gave him a different perspective.
42:48
Art’s also a good writer, and I always appreciated that because you
42:52
can see opportunities to have ideas put together and shared at that time,
42:58
as we still wrote memos and letters.
43:00
Even later, Art had a potential to be a Ph.
43:04
D. candidate, and we knew that.
43:05
He had the brain power and the writing abilities.
43:09
Yet, at
43:12
that time, he thought it would be fine to be on the Andrews for a while.
43:16
We worked very, very closely with him, in all the coordination.
43:19
You can imagine, this is basically a phone call every night for five years or
43:26
so.
43:27
That was pretty intense.
43:28
He stayed up there, must have been a decade.
43:31
He knows.
43:32
Then he had kids and wanted to get into a different school system,
43:37
and for other reasons, he wanted to move here [Corvallis] . Then,
43:42
I hired another site coordinator who struggled very, very hard
43:48
to do everything, and who didn’t have the same innate abilities.
43:53
Things wouldn’t get done quite right, no matter how hard he worked.
43:56
It was not the same as what Art could do.
43:58
Who was this?
43:59
Who was that?
44:01
[Chuckle] I’d have to look up the name.
44:03
He wasn’t there very long then?
44:05
He was there a couple years, but the met [meteorological]
44:07
stations became uncalibrated.
44:13
You run into these people two times in your life.
44:23
They’re really working hard and you’re trying to help them, and they’re
44:29
working right at their capacity, or maybe just slightly above it.
44:34
When something happens where you have to do more than that, that’s really unfair.
44:41
You push them above that.
44:44
You can get people that can work at about three-quarter capacity, they’re
44:49
the same for crises and they’re motivated, so you’re usually home free.
44:55
It takes a long time to recognize them.
44:58
There’s a whole bunch of them I’ve found that really want to do the work.
45:04
They want to be a musician.
45:05
I wanted to be an athlete.
45:07
And
45:10
the attitude is just so good.
45:11
They’ll come to work for nothing the first month, that kind of attitude.
45:15
I used to be that way, too, when I was starting out.
45:18
But they don’t know what their real capacity is.
45:23
And then, there’s a later stage where you should be on guard,
45:26
and that’s where they’re good.
45:29
They’re in their forties and they still haven’t had a job for
45:31
more than one year at any place.
45:33
Then, all you have to do is check, because there’s something else wrong here.
45:37
If it isn’t this trying to do more than what your ability is, there’s
45:41
something even worse involved.
45:45
Those are the two things that catch.
45:46
So, you begin to look for talent, and then, you burnish that talent.
45:51
It’s much easier with your own graduate students than it is with other people,
45:55
but you still find if you talk to people and ask them about ideas and
46:01
that, that at least when you get into these kind of programs, you can sort
46:05
out who might be a good site manager from those who might really struggle.
46:10
We never found anyone that didn’t want to do the job and didn’t try hard.
46:13
We never got anybody who was lazy at that job.
46:17
You’ve got people to work with, you’ve got reports to write, you have instruments
46:22
to calibrate, and it’s a tough job.
46:25
I’m curious here about the rationale behind why a site coordinator was
46:29
deemed necessary in ’71, because there hadn’t been one up until that point.
46:31
Is that right?
46:32
Well, we had so many people coming that didn’t know where
46:35
to go and where the sites were.
46:37
We had phones and we had to put locks on those phones so
46:41
people didn’t call everywhere.
46:42
We initially set up a whole bunch of tents, and then, we had trailers off-site.
46:52
Eventually,
46:57
we brought in used trailers and set them up where the present stations are.
47:05
At the very end of it, we had to redesign plumbing systems with the
47:09
state and federal government together.
47:12
That obviously became more than Dick [self-reference] was able to handle
47:16
for research interests, because you’re now building bricks and mortar.
47:21
That’s a different kind of person than a scientist who’s interested in
47:25
the beginning and end of a project.
47:26
It’s sort of like a boat builder for oceanography.
47:30
You know, somebody will have to build the boat and equip it, and then the
47:34
oceanographers get on to do the cruise to gather the data to publish together.
47:38
Well, I’m great at integrating the oceanographers to get on and
47:42
publish it, but I don’t do plumbing.
47:44
Yeah, I was gonna ask that.
47:46
It was hours and hours of these things, and things would break.
47:52
I think there was two years, that if I hadn’t hired a masters-level person, I
47:57
wouldn’t have had any publications out.
47:58
And with that masters’ person, we got nine out.
47:58
I’m re-writing a textbook with him
48:03
right now.
48:03
Are you co-authors with him in other words?
48:05
Yeah.
48:06
But, I couldn’t do it alone because the logistical problems that have
48:11
to be part of your daily concern when you’re running a large program
48:15
and people need these facilities.
48:17
You’re gonna have little things like the dogs are in their things and people
48:21
are using the phone, I mean, just little things that eat up forty hours a week.
48:29
You were administrator for a while, and you were also a university professor.
48:33
Right.
48:33
And writing publications.
48:35
Sounds like you were having some difficulty reconciling those.
48:37
Well, for a year.
48:40
I don’t take forever to reach a decision [chuckles] when it’s not working.
48:45
When you’re working eighty hours a week and you’re still not getting
48:47
any publications out, then you say, “Well, obviously I can’t work
48:50
more than eighty hours a week.
48:52
I’ve got a young family and this kind of thing, so what are you going to do?” Well,
48:55
you’re going to figure out a way so that somebody else has to resolve it for you.
48:59
Okay.
48:59
Or you’re going to hire more people, and we had the resources to hire more people.
49:03
We had
49:06
the need.
49:07
Paul Jarvis documented the need.
49:10
Jerry Franklin was in Washington, D.C. at that time, and we got a supplement.
49:14
The supplement supported this master’s student so that I could take a deep breath
49:18
and still think research and do the rest.
49:22
Pretty cheap investment for nine publications in two years.
49:25
Who’s the student?
49:26
Steve Running
49:27
Okay.
49:27
I’ve heard his name.
49:29
Steve Running, yeah.
49:31
Gabe Tucker was talking about him.
49:34
University of Montana.
49:34
We’re just finishing the second edition of this textbook.
49:40
He brings all the expertise in remote-sensing and large-scale
49:44
modeling to the book.
49:46
He went on to get a Ph.D. later?
49:48
Yeah, at the University of Colorado.
49:51
Any reason why he didn’t do that here?
49:55
A couple reasons.
49:55
My general philosophy for students, remembering that I went to University
49:59
of Minnesota and [Cal] Berkeley, was you don’t get your upper
50:03
degrees at the same institution.
50:05
Okay.
50:06
Because one, you learn how to see different perspectives.
50:09
And two, you have a whole set of new people you know.
50:12
So, unless you’ve got a terribly constraining family relationship so you
50:18
can’t move, something like that, it’s really desirable to go somewhere else.
50:23
Now, that was also before there were post-docs.
50:27
Now, I’m a little more tolerant because most people have to have at least
50:32
one post-doc, if not two post-docs.
50:34
Now, if they stay at the same place as they got their undergraduate degrees,
50:40
their Ph.D. and post-doc, then I have all kinds of problems with that for their
50:46
careers and a whole bunch of other things.
50:48
Because, it’s too incestuous a relationship.
50:52
That’s what you advised people?
50:53
Oh, yeah.
50:54
You bet.
50:56
One other question I had about Art was, how’d you go about selecting
51:01
a site manager, and what kind of connections were expected?
51:06
Well, he came recommended from people in the Northeast.
51:10
We knew from other people in the system that this guy had qualities we wanted,
51:15
so he wasn’t a complete unknown.
51:16
You mean in the IBP system?
51:17
In the IBP system, or, I don’t think it was Hubbard Brook.
51:21
I think he came from
51:24
Maine.
51:25
I think he had been at Hubbard Brook.
51:27
I think so.
51:28
He had a linkage.
51:29
They said, we had a person who’s coming west, or who’d like to come
51:33
west, and is interested, so are you?
51:34
I said, well, yeah.
51:36
Actually, he had two chances to get a Ph.
51:41
D., one with me and one with a professor in botany.
51:46
In both cases, he didn’t finish.
51:50
Is there a reason?
51:53
I think in one case there was family.
51:58
And I’m not exactly sure what, divorce or things like that
52:00
were going on at that time.
52:02
But I think
52:05
he had probably waited quite a long time to get a Ph.
52:07
D. in those days, and it was going to take a lot of effort, and maybe not
52:13
the same pay and responsibilities.
52:15
So the question was, “Do I really need this to do the
52:19
kinds of things I like to do?”
52:24
In retrospect, he would have had different options had he had a Ph. D.
52:28
at that time. Today, I’m not sure a Ph.
52:31
D. does you any good at all.
52:32
But, at that time, it would have given him different options.
52:37
But, he still would have been writing grants, or teaching five courses a year.
52:43
Those are the options.
52:44
You don’t get this thing, like somebody’s going to give you a
52:46
12-month salary and research money.
52:50
They might give you a 9-month salary, but they’re not going to give you
52:52
any research support, and you still have to do all the other things.
52:57
I think maybe by putting him on the Andrews, put him in a little
53:02
bit more isolated situation than was good for that final decision.
53:06
But, he made the decision.
53:08
He actually was on campus, and I felt sad about it because he had the capability.
53:15
Okay?
53:15
We’re not arguing that.
53:18
To do it, you have to jump some hoops.
53:20
The longer you wait to jump the hoops, the harder it is.
53:25
But it wasn’t that we didn’t want to see this person have the opportunity to get a
53:29
Ph.D. and would force him to stay at the Andrews forever and not achieve that goal.
53:35
That’s not one of the outcomes.
53:37
He had two chances.
53:39
And
53:42
he doesn’t sound too worried about it currently.
53:44
Oh, no.
53:45
I don’t think he is.
53:48
During the period of IBP, how
53:54
would you characterize your priorities as an Oregon State University professor
53:59
involved in research at the Andrews?
54:03
Well, I put it as the highest priority.
54:07
I always have one high priority and just a couple modest ones beyond that.
54:11
Because I can only have one major priority in science.
54:15
I can’t do three things at once, never have, never will.
54:20
I can schedule things, so I have different months, different promises, I made.
54:26
But I’ve got enough of a Midwestern background that my
54:30
promises are sort of my word.
54:33
So, if I tell you it’s going to happen on that day, it’s going to happen.
54:37
Occasionally, when people told me something was going to happen and it
54:40
didn’t happen, we’d have some “public hangings,” because I just wasn’t used
54:45
to that. From the Midwest, you promise this and we’re planning to put this
54:50
together, and I’m having to assemble this, and you haven’t done it. And you
54:53
didn’t tell me ahead of time that you were having problems so I could help you.
54:57
Well, that’s something you don’t want to do to too many Midwesterners.
55:02
Because they’re used to blizzards and expecting to have the chains
55:05
on and water in the radiator.
55:09
You don’t do these things and you told them you would.
55:11
This is not conducive, we had quite a big mix of people, and probably a third
55:17
of them fell into that latter category.
55:20
Just by chance, it’s not that I wanted to do it, I think.
55:25
They just had other things come up.
55:29
This is when you’re working eighty hours a week and you’re meeting your deadlines and
55:32
they’re telling you, well.....[Chuckle]
55:36
How did those kinds of issues get resolved?
55:40
Well, in most cases, if the private and public hearings didn’t get
55:47
their attention, they weren’t on the payroll the next year.
55:50
Oh, I see.
56:01
Any examples of that?
56:01
Somebody pointed out to me once, that each person is supposed to bring a
56:06
paragraph so we could help assemble these ideas and I could get to writing these
56:13
integrated reports for the year.
56:15
We were going to have them presented at these meetings so everyone else
56:20
could hear what this person would say.
56:23
I remember Phil Sollins was one of those persons, and he didn’t do it.
56:27
So he got publicly taken apart.
56:30
It’s
56:36
like,
56:39
you promised this.
56:41
We got other people in line.
56:42
Here you are today and you haven’t done it.
56:44
Yeah.
56:45
You know, there isn’t any excuse.
56:48
Well, there was an excuse, but it wasn’t something I bought.
56:50
Then everyone else is terrorized, which is one thing that my
56:55
professor at Berkeley taught me.
56:56
You don’t have
57:00
to shoot the whole group.
57:02
Just shoot one, for God’s sake.
57:05
There’d be other cases, where,
57:09
mostly graduate students were trying, but they couldn’t quite share their data yet.
57:16
Then you wonder, how can we get the data?
57:18
What more money do you need, or how can we do this?
57:21
And then their professor would say, “Well, he’s not ready to do that until the thesis
57:24
is completely done.” Well, that wasn’t the deal. The deal was that as part of an
57:28
IBP, when we’re doing these workshops and things, we need to know what you have now.
57:32
We allow you to correct them later, but we have to do these things, so we
57:36
usually supported the graduate student for one more year, and then terminate.
57:44
We did that with three different professors in forest science,
57:49
and I was an associate professor.
57:51
Is that right?
57:51
Did that create tension in the department?
57:54
Sure.
57:56
Who was department chair then?
57:58
We had Dale Bever and Richard Dillworth.
58:05
They were caught in-between.
58:09
And of course, money.
58:11
Well,
58:14
I was looking for a way to do it.
58:20
We never quit speaking to the people.
58:26
I’d still go to soccer games, and we’d still do it.
58:32
At least I thought it had to be done, so it was up to me
58:35
to go figure out how to do it.
58:37
We’d hire post-docs, and we had some wonderful post-docs,
58:42
too, that have gone on to be department chairs and other things.
58:45
What was the typical path how you identified post-docs to bring in?
58:49
How did that occur?
58:50
They usually had been somehow attached as a graduate student
58:53
to one of the other IBP groups.
58:56
So, they already had been involved learning the ropes in a special field.
59:01
Chuck Grier came down as one of Dale Cole’s students, and he was great.
59:06
He knew the soils and nutrient cycling, and he worked with one of my graduate
59:11
students, Bob Logan, and they did some beautiful pieces of work together.
59:19
That could be one example.
59:20
Bill Emmingham, who was a post-doc here, no, he was still getting
59:24
his Ph.D., and I think he also had about one year as a post-doc.
59:27
It was much harder on the Ph.D.s, because when you try to
59:46
give input
59:46
-- That time, what would you guarantee up front?
59:47
Yeah, sort of.
59:50
We could see that, and then at the end, either they’d find opportunities
59:55
or we’d find opportunities within the university system.
59:58
The system was much wider than just Oregon State, with all the contacts
1:00:12
that we had.
1:00:13
I was curious, also, what person was assigned to do that?
1:00:18
We would have workshops where we’d try to formulate the major
1:00:25
structure of the model and what variables we measure at what time.
1:00:29
We didn’t really have the models running before we started gathering data.
1:00:33
There
1:00:37
was one time we knew we had to, for example, upgrade
1:00:40
the meteorological station.
1:00:42
The basic models ran on more than minimum-maximum temperature
1:00:47
and daily precipitation.
1:00:50
Preferably, I’d like to have hourly precip so you could know whether it was snowing
1:00:53
at night or raining during the day.
1:00:54
Otherwise, your model can’t predict the difference, as they needed
1:00:59
to have radiation and humidity.
1:01:05
So, even though the watershed stuff was there with the met station,
1:01:09
it wasn’t an adequate met station, and you couldn’t drive any models
1:01:12
- photosynthesis, hydrology or even nutrient-cycling - without either
1:01:18
estimating that or measuring it.
1:01:19
So you would say, we better measure it.
1:01:23
Actually, I’ll bet it took us another decade after I quit before we convinced
1:01:29
the other IBP sites, or LTER sites, to have a standardized set of quality
1:01:34
met-data to drive these models.
1:01:36
They didn’t have them, or some did, yet didn’t address that [standards]
1:01:41
. But at the end of IBP when we
1:01:45
were moving towards LTER, that was one of the things I thought was so obvious
1:01:48
we wouldn’t have to talk about it.
1:01:49
Well, we talked about it for a year and it didn’t happen.
1:01:53
It was not ready yet.
1:01:55
We have to get these models out, people have to use them, because what was
1:01:59
good enough for the Forest Service twenty years ago on precipitation and
1:02:02
temperature, wasn’t good enough if you were going to generalize these models.
1:02:08
Later on, we found out ways to correlate minimum-maximum
1:02:10
temperature with radiation.
1:02:11
But, at that time we had to have the good data out there to make a comparison.
1:02:17
We didn’t have to do it forever, but you had to do it for a year.
1:02:19
That’s just one example.
1:02:22
What turned the corner on convincing
1:02:26
other sites to do it?
1:02:27
Probably that, and the reviews of their proposals.
1:02:33
Those of us that were successful and publishing, ended up on the review board.
1:02:40
It doesn’t happen instantly, but if you keep using the wrong equations and these
1:02:43
kinds of things keep happening, eventually somebody will say, “This isn’t perfect,
1:02:46
but at least you’ve got to have...”
1:02:50
Also, NASA had done collaboration with LTERs for measuring and
1:02:58
estimating incoming radiation, and they’re estimating variables from satellites
1:03:02
to compare predicted versus observed.
1:03:04
There are additional reasons to put both stations out there.
1:03:09
All things in time.
1:03:10
Some things that we thought were important turned out not to
1:03:18
be.
1:03:18
Any examples of things
1:03:24
you thought were important that
1:03:29
weren’t?
1:03:30
I think it was important to know methods that did not work,
1:03:34
and one was root production.
1:03:37
We spent time in this country, and the world, hours and hours digging up and
1:03:43
coring for roots, trying to separate them out and get production values by
1:03:47
looking at cores every month or so, to estimate the change in weight of fine
1:03:51
roots in soils extracted every month.
1:03:54
Sometimes that gives you a pretty decent value, and sometimes it doesn’t.
1:04:02
No matter how hard you work, you get big errors.
1:04:04
So, we’ve had to wait until periscopes came, where you could actually put these
1:04:10
tubes into the soil and put a video camera down there to photograph the changes from
1:04:14
white roots to brown roots to dead roots.
1:04:17
Also,
1:04:19
monitor the system, and then have independent estimates of how much
1:04:22
carbon is coming in, how much is used above ground, how much is allowed to
1:04:25
come below ground, and what fraction of that is likely going to the roots.
1:04:29
So, you begin to get closure on your models by knowing more
1:04:32
and having methods that work.
1:04:35
And we had a lot of people making a tremendous effort trying to get
1:04:41
fine root production and turnover.
1:04:43
And some of those estimates are great.
1:04:44
Some are one-third to more carbon than you possibly have available
1:04:50
left over after you’ve accounted for above ground production.
1:04:54
These were sort of originally going to be our standards.
1:04:58
Well, when your standards are not reliable then, and
1:05:01
-- Yeah.
1:05:02
-- you’re not quite sure you shouldn’t have done it
1:05:06
[continuation of previous graph] . You’re very unsure that’s the real standard.
1:05:11
That would be
1:05:14
one example.
1:05:15
Leaking watersheds were the original concern.
1:05:18
You have these watersheds where you think you’ve measured everything
1:05:20
that comes in and everything that goes out, but there’s a fracture [in
1:05:23
the weir or in bedrock] and a lot of water doesn’t go out over the weir.
1:05:27
That
1:05:30
doesn’t mean you quit measuring the watersheds, but it means that you
1:05:32
really try a number of different ways to see whether or not you can
1:05:36
get closure on those water balances.
1:05:38
One way was to put isotopes and heat pulses into trees to keep track of
1:05:43
the daily and seasonal transpiration.
1:05:46
So, you made sure that was right.
1:05:48
Then, changes in the soil water volumes.
1:05:50
And if that was right, then, what’s left over?
1:05:52
At a certain rate, water should go into the stream.
1:05:54
So, to check all your assumptions through the model, not just what the model said.
1:06:03
That would be an example.
1:06:05
I guess the latest check on a lot of our models
1:06:14
is to estimate the total amount of carbon, for example, that
1:06:18
was needed to grow a forest.
1:06:21
We did that at that time by adding up the change in biomass.
1:06:27
Here’s a tree and it’s growing this much, and here’s the roots and they’re growing
1:06:31
this much, and then, it costs this much to maintain these leaves, and it costs this
1:06:35
much to build this foliage, and so forth.
1:06:37
Then add it up and say that’s got to be how much carbon you have.
1:06:42
When we did that and published on it from the Andrews,
1:06:48
in one case, I think, we overestimated by two-fold.
1:06:55
In print.
1:06:57
[Chuckle]
1:06:59
Other people overestimated by two-fold also.
1:07:03
They made assumptions that turned out to be wrong in the models.
1:07:07
The way we got closure was with techniques worked out by a micro-meteorologist
1:07:13
and some people working with the biome, Leo Fritchen up at the University
1:07:17
of Washington, who worked and worked and worked on techniques that
1:07:22
required very high-speed computers and very accurate instruments.
1:07:25
It’s called eddy-flux measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor,
1:07:30
continuously above a forest, or above grass or any vegetation.
1:07:35
When you do that continuously, you get the total amount of water vapor
1:07:39
actually moving by the top, you get the carbon net flux in and out
1:07:43
and at night and fall respiration.
1:07:45
And you can get closure on these models.
1:07:49
And, oh my God!
1:07:49
It’s off by two!
1:07:51
This kind of thing.
1:07:53
You get into the processes of the photosynthesis, stomatal
1:07:56
control, and water uptake.
1:07:58
Once you understand those, you have these ultimate constraints that I suppose in
1:08:02
retrospect, you should have known anyway.
1:08:04
Okay?
1:08:05
But, you were adding it up this way and everybody else was doing
1:08:08
it this way, and you were putting these figures in the models.
1:08:11
What, just reducing the errors of estimations?
1:08:13
Yes, and going back to first principles.
1:08:15
We had principles about what the theoretical conversion of
1:08:18
light into photosynthesis is.
1:08:20
We had surpassed that.
1:08:25
We had other cases where we would sample diameters of trees and correlate with
1:08:31
the amount of leaves the trees had.
1:08:33
When the trees got bigger and bigger, we would only fell trees
1:08:36
that would not hit other trees.
1:08:39
Think about it.
1:08:40
Those turned out to have a high amount of leaves on them because
1:08:43
they had more growing space than trees shaded by close neighbors.
1:08:46
Then you take these diameter correlations, that are algorithmic,
1:08:49
and you’d go out and measure diameters of trees and calculate the leaf area.
1:08:54
What you’d end up with is values twice the amount than all the light
1:08:59
that had already been absorbed.
1:09:00
Sure.
1:09:01
Well, we could have seen this in
1:09:04
20 minutes, and known it was wrong.
1:09:08
We eventually corrected the literature.
1:09:10
But a lot of stuff in the data-bank, and a lot of the stuff that has
1:09:12
been published, it still has the equations that are off by two.
1:09:20
These were really hard methods.
1:09:21
We were felling eighty-, ninety-meter tall trees, and the Japanese were
1:09:27
helping us collecting all the biomass and showing us how they do these things.
1:09:33
It really wasn’t any lack of effort or actually structured analyses
1:09:36
that caused the sample to be biased.
1:09:39
What do you do once you find that problem?
1:09:41
What we did is we had three or four independent methods,
1:09:46
and we got a publication out where a graduate student went to one of the stands
1:09:51
that had already been estimated with this other equation, measured the amount of
1:09:55
light coming through the canopy using the Lambert Law, and found out that with much
1:09:58
light, the leaf area can’t be above eight.
1:10:01
The original method says 16 layers of leaves.
1:10:05
Okay?
1:10:06
We have litter fall estimates because we’d collected litter
1:10:08
fall every month for two years.
1:10:10
We knew that about 25% to a third of the leaf litter, turns over each year.
1:10:14
Multiplied by four, that came out to eight.
1:10:17
And then, we had a correlation with water relations with
1:10:24
the part of the tree that conducts water, the sapwood.
1:10:27
We had a linear correlation between the cross-sectional area of that sapwood
1:10:31
and the amount of leaves on that tree.
1:10:32
That also came out to eight.
1:10:33
So, we had three methods that said eight, and we had one that said sixteen.
1:10:39
This is how you trick things up you that need better estimates for.
1:10:45
It hurt because our original standard was wrong.
1:10:50
It’s the
1:10:53
same with the fine roots.
1:10:54
What looked like the easiest thing to measure was the above-ground stuff.
1:10:57
We felt we’ll be able to do this and the Japanese were doing it.
1:11:00
Turned out that we measured it wrong.
1:11:03
And it was just because, if we felled the other trees that were
1:11:06
representative, we would have taken down a lot of the neighboring trees
1:11:08
and not been able to separate out which branch belonged to which tree.
1:11:16
Then, what it leads to is additional studies and more publications.
1:11:20
Right.
1:11:20
I mean, you always publish and correct your mistakes.
1:11:26
The principle I got out of it is, don’t measure and make your estimates
1:11:30
just by modeling and one method.
1:11:33
Try to have two or three independent methods that estimate these on the same
1:11:36
sites, even if you have to bring in NASA aircrafts to do one, and use two
1:11:41
different sensors to do the others.
1:11:43
That’s what we did on
1:11:47
the same days on the same publications.
1:11:50
You can tell whether you are right or wrong.
1:11:52
It gives you a lot more confidence.
1:11:54
We still have problems, but that would be one example.
1:11:58
When did NASA start cooperating on
1:12:02
these things at the Andrews?
1:12:03
Oh, I would say the big thing came when I came back from NASA headquarters.
1:12:09
No, before I went to NASA headquarters.
1:12:11
You were there?
1:12:12
I didn’t know that.
1:12:14
Year-and-a-half.
1:12:15
I’d been on committees with NASA, probably starting in the early eighties,
1:12:25
because I was trying to learn about what these things could
1:12:28
do to drive models from space.
1:12:33
There was a lot of hype in engineering that these things do everything.
1:12:36
But of course, the engineers don’t know what they really measure.
1:12:39
They’re correlated with things.
1:12:40
So, I was called in as a physiologist to help with pigments and physiology.
1:12:49
We would really start checking these things by writing joint
1:12:53
grants with some of the people I worked on committees with, and Steve
1:12:56
Running and some of his students.
1:13:00
We would do it across this Oregon transect that Henry Gholz had already established,
1:13:04
so we knew something about the history of it, the climates, and so forth.
1:13:09
They would fly over these sites on the same day
1:13:13
with eight different planes, anything they had, plus our own lightweight aircraft.
1:13:18
So, we started our own “air force” here.
1:13:19
We had three aircraft and all the remote sensing gear.
1:13:25
We would make those comparisons and
1:13:30
try to scale it up.
1:13:32
We’re still doing this now with people from other countries.
1:13:34
This
1:13:38
came out in ‘94, but most of the fieldwork in Oregon was done in ‘89 and ‘90.
1:13:43
Remote Sensing Environment [The journal] has special issues, and
1:13:45
this was from a special issue.
1:13:50
This
1:14:07
is one of our planes [showing Geier image in magazine].
1:14:15
The link was that we could come down on the ground and make measurements,
1:14:19
or in the laboratory check these principles that they thought the remote
1:14:22
sensing instruments were measuring.
1:14:26
Other groups of biologists and physiologists were involved, too.
1:14:29
Once we had a bit more confidence, and once the remote sensing group
1:14:33
had more confidence, then you could see these ideas being scaled, going
1:14:38
regional, going to the earth level.
1:14:40
We still had a lot of unknowns, but by having all these aircraft and ground
1:14:45
measurements across a wide area of vegetation that gave them confidence
1:14:49
that, “There’s something here.
1:14:50
There’s the same instruments, the same principles, and it’s
1:14:54
global.” Now you can see why a scientist like me was interested.
1:14:58
Sure.
1:14:59
You’re always looking for ways to scale.
1:15:01
This is one tool.
1:15:02
The model is another tool.
1:15:03
Stable isotopes are a third tool.
1:15:09
For stable isotopes, I took a year’s sabbatical at Woods
1:15:10
Hole to learn about them.
1:15:11
At where?
1:15:11
Woods Hole Biological Lab in Massachusetts, for stable isotopes.
1:15:13
I also worked
1:15:19
some time that year with a group in New York.
1:15:24
For me to learn these techniques and get these ideas, I had to
1:15:28
leave Oregon State, or mount a new project where these people come in.
1:15:32
I may leave for a year just to mount another five-year project for going
1:15:37
to coordinate the NASA “air force.”
1:15:39
When did you go to Woods Hole?
1:15:41
Uh...
1:15:41
In the mid-eighties?
1:15:46
Partly on a NASA grant
1:15:50
to see whether these ideas would come together, partly
1:15:52
on a stipend that they paid.
1:16:15
It’s my
1:16:17
understanding this
1:16:35
is taking place mainly after you’ve kind of backed away from the Andrews group.
1:16:39
Oh, yeah.
1:16:41
I still occasionally go up to the Andrews, usually to help somebody
1:16:44
out like Kate White or Phil Sollins.
1:16:49
But,
1:16:52
if we’re going to do the work that we’re now funded to do for NASA, we
1:16:56
need fairly uniform topography for these eddy flux things and for planes to fly.
1:17:02
Uh-huh.
1:17:02
Extremely dangerous for light aircraft to fly in the Andrews.
1:17:05
We flew it once and just about killed the pilot because we hit a downdraft.
1:17:08
We got bigger planes and better planes, but still, it’s a very dangerous area.
1:17:12
It’s got these tremendous downdrafts.
1:17:14
Did he actually crash?
1:17:15
No.
1:17:16
No.
1:17:16
But he barely pulled out, because he didn’t have much power left to pull out.
1:17:20
He needed a bigger plane.
1:17:22
So, I wouldn’t have anything more to do with any flights over the Andrews in
1:17:26
any plane that I was responsible for.
1:17:30
With the eddy-flux stuff, we need about a mile of fairly uniform topography
1:17:37
where you can fly safely over it.
1:17:38
We work with
1:17:40
NOAA, which now has our light aircraft and also some bigger ones of their own.
1:17:45
And they actually monitor the CO2 and water vapor flux
1:17:50
from each area they’re above.
1:17:54
That’s really difficult to do in the Andrews.
1:17:58
You can’t have big slopes like this and that.
1:18:03
Also, we were interested in the big differences.
1:18:07
We were interested in ponderosa pine forest and juniper forest, and
1:18:11
the spruce forest at Cascade Head.
1:18:12
The
1:18:16
Andrews is a spot.
1:18:17
A great spot.
1:18:19
But, it’s only a spot.
1:18:20
Sure.
1:18:20
You need a bigger scale.
1:18:22
I need a bigger scale,
1:18:30
right.
1:18:31
I wanted to track down a little bit more clearly your connection with NASA.
1:18:35
What were you doing in those committees where you
1:18:38
-- -- They called up and asked if I would be willing to advise them on the
1:18:43
potential design of a new satellite that would have very, very fine
1:18:46
resolution for spectrometry and be able to do pigment analysis from space.
1:18:50
I said, “I don’t know anything about satellites, but everybody
1:18:56
has a textbook on pigments.
1:18:58
So, yeah, I can come.
1:18:59
I’ll learn something.” I’d already been reading about NASA, otherwise they
1:19:02
wouldn’t have known my phone number.
1:19:04
And I’d been to workshops Dan Botkin had held where
1:19:08
they were looking at ideas about what’s the minimum amount of life and
1:19:13
structure you would have to have to have a self-functioning ecosystem in space.
1:19:18
Since all ecosystems are open – they’re not closed systems -- I
1:19:21
don’t know what the answer is.
1:19:26
But, maybe you could recycle the water and everything and use the sun’s
1:19:31
energy still to drive it from space.
1:19:33
That might still do it.
1:19:35
We’d had lots of contacts from these workshops that NASA would invite us to be
1:19:44
part of.
1:19:44
That got me maybe deeper than I wanted to get.
1:19:51
I could see the way for my graduate students to write grants to get
1:19:55
funding to test the underlying assumptions for these models.
1:20:00
Barbara Yoder [later Bond] was one of my first students to really test this.
1:20:04
At the same time we had this big NASA project over Oregon.
1:20:09
I think I had three of my graduate students involved in that – two Ph.Ds.
1:20:15
and one masters.
1:20:20
All these other people were coming in and they had a full-time pilot, but
1:20:28
they only had
1:20:31
two years.
1:20:38
We would allow you to come in, but we weren’t responsible for funding,
1:20:43
so it was opening a wider door.
1:21:00
Nice.
1:21:01
Thousands and thousands of images and data and met station data.
1:21:04
This is all going back to that first transect?
1:21:05
The Oregon Transect?
1:21:06
Yeah,
1:21:12
the Oregon Transect.
1:21:12
It isn’t that I’ve abandoned Oregon.
1:21:14
I like beginnings and ends of projects, and I like to see them scale.
1:21:18
I like to have the underlying things checked out.
1:21:22
The Andrews is more of an ongoing kind of thing.
1:21:24
It’s not a beginning or an end.
1:21:27
At least, we hope not.
1:21:29
Most of the people now involved are fully involved doing what,
1:21:32
what they already planned to do.
1:21:38
You
1:21:40
just overload the system if you actually went to the Andrews every time.
1:21:43
Got a hundred graduate students up there now or something like that.
1:21:46
And now I’m going to bring in the NASA aircraft.
1:21:48
It wasn’t even considered.
1:21:51
I didn’t even think about going to the Andrews.
1:21:54
It’s interesting, you’ve been talking quite a bit about
1:21:55
how you had a fair number of graduate students over the years.
1:21:58
I’ve had 21 in 33 years, I know where they all are and we still publish,
1:22:04
or they publish with one another.
1:22:06
We’re very close.
1:22:07
It’s family.
1:22:08
That’s where I do my closest learning, and I’m very much interested in what
1:22:15
they’re doing, and I’m very interested in their success, their careers,
1:22:20
philosophies of science, and networking.
1:22:23
That’s where I spend most of my time.
1:22:25
You’ve mentioned other professors and other scientists, but your
1:22:29
collaborative work tends to be often with graduate students, it sounds like.
1:22:32
Well, originally it was.
1:22:33
But now I’m using post-docs, because there’re no jobs for graduate students.
1:22:40
I’ve collaborated with other fine scientists and I’ve also published
1:22:45
fairly recently with probably 3/4 of my former Ph.D. students, which
1:22:51
is sort of like coming around again.
1:22:54
And I’ve always had foreign students very much in mind.
1:22:56
We’ve sponsored visiting scientists, three from Costa Rica, and
1:23:05
one from Austria, and then, 22 years later, his son came back and lived in our
1:23:08
house as an undergraduate student [OSU] . I sponsored one and an offspring, I guess.
1:23:14
We’ve had visiting scientists from Sweden, from Norway, from Germany,
1:23:21
from Scotland, from New Zealand, too.
1:23:26
And I work with these people.
1:23:28
We publish with these people when we go there.
1:23:30
So, my world is very close as far as people are concerned.
1:23:36
Far flung.
1:23:36
They’re far flung, right.
1:23:38
And the graduate students help, because there’s one in Quebec and
1:23:41
one in Florida and one in Idaho.
1:23:45
Barbara Yoder and Mike Ryan, they’re working in Panama.
1:23:49
It
1:23:52
doesn’t matter where you are anymore.
1:23:53
The big change in science is if you can write the grant together and cleanly get
1:23:57
it, you can go anywhere in the world for two or three years and get the work done.
1:24:01
Even when
1:24:04
you were starting that wasn’t true.
1:24:04
But
1:24:07
it’s true now.
1:24:11
You mentioned the recent shift to post-docs and the lack of jobs.
1:24:15
What you mean by that?
1:24:15
You don’t see job prospects for graduate students so you don’t
1:24:19
take them on as often or what?
1:24:20
I’m not taking any right now, but I’m getting up in years too.
1:24:25
I’ve got three of my last graduates that have been working
1:24:33
on half-million to million-dollar grants that they’re PI or co-PI on.
1:24:39
They’re still post-docs.
1:24:41
Well, they’re more than post-docs, because in some cases,
1:24:44
they’re the PI on the grant.
1:24:46
But they’re still in an unstable position.
1:24:48
Until they get into a more stable position, like a five-year appointment,
1:24:52
something like that, I shouldn’t be training more graduate students.
1:24:56
I’m flooding the market with good people, and these are good people.
1:25:00
These people can write, they can think, and work with other people, and
1:25:04
they’ve had to take physical chemistry and have to speak a foreign language.
1:25:08
These are not normal requirements, and they have to work with me for
1:25:12
three or four years [Chuckle].
1:25:15
That’s quite a cross to bear for both of us, if they’re not successful.
1:25:26
Nobody’s requiring me not to take graduate students, but that’s my rationale for it.
1:25:31
Also, I could have retired some years ago.
1:25:35
I’m
1:25:37
really looking for talent anywhere I can find it.
1:25:40
I’ll see if I can help them.
1:25:43
That’s very rewarding, and I’m at a position where I can do that.
1:25:48
What you’re saying is that teaching has been a pretty high
1:25:50
priority for you all along?
1:25:51
Oh yeah.
1:25:51
Very much so.
1:25:52
Not that I’m a great teacher, okay?
1:25:54
But one-on-one, I really enjoy, and small graduate classes.
1:26:00
Undergraduates, they just don’t know the background well enough and
1:26:04
I’m always trying to push them, and some of the class can be pushed, but
1:26:07
the rest aren’t ready to be pushed.
1:26:10
Unless I’m fully in charge of that and I can work with them, one-on-one
1:26:14
through email, I can’t really solve the problems they’re facing.
1:26:21
You’re a teacher too; this is really hard, it’s really frustrating.
1:26:25
Yeah.
1:26:25
And the pressure is always for larger classes, and less time one-on-one.
1:26:28
Right.
1:26:35
There was an effort to formalize an agreement between OSU and the
1:26:38
Forest Service concerning managing the Andrews in ‘76, I think it
1:26:41
started, and continued through ‘78.
1:26:47
What were the concerns and reasons for trying to update
1:26:49
the agreement at that point?
1:26:51
I think the big concern was how much investment NSF at that time was going to
1:26:57
continue to make in the Andrews and the university [OSU] . At that time the vice
1:27:05
president of research, who I think was
1:27:12
John Byrne, who would become president, made a commitment following an NSF review
1:27:19
to pick up all of Art McKee’s salary.
1:27:25
Now this may have come back to the College of Forestry, but he made
1:27:27
that formal agreement when this review panel was here from the NSF.
1:27:31
If we continue to support this from the Andrews, what’s
1:27:35
the university going to do?
1:27:37
Okay?
1:27:37
And then in turn, and what’s the Forest Service going to do?
1:27:40
Now we’re talking about building with federal money permanent buildings
1:27:44
on the Andrews and plumbing them.
1:27:46
What kind of commitment do we have that there’s going to be control on the
1:27:51
kind of the facilities and operations.
1:27:53
We’ve got to have an agreement here.
1:27:56
We can’t go into building buildings and expecting great things and
1:28:01
then neither the university nor the Forest Service show us that they
1:28:05
have a long-term commitment too.
1:28:07
So that was the driving thing.
1:28:09
It was pretty obvious.
1:28:10
That was about the time that the Long-Term Ecological Research grants were beginning?
1:28:18
Yeah, you’d have to check with Art on that.
1:28:22
You can see that the only reason I remember dates is because I write them
1:28:27
down.
1:28:27
I’m sorry.
1:28:28
Dates are important, but I might get them out of sequence.
1:28:30
But that was really important and that was the first time Art had full
1:28:34
support independent of the NSF grants.
1:28:37
Oh, is that right?
1:28:38
It came, I think, from that university agreement with NSF, that
1:28:47
at the same time or shortly thereafter, pushed the Forest Service to have
1:28:49
to sign on the line that we would have control that would take the
1:28:53
forest out of the allowable cut.
1:28:56
Oh.
1:28:58
Otherwise, the allowable cuts they are always driving, you
1:29:00
have to take something out.
1:29:02
Well, let’s put the pressure off and physically take them
1:29:06
out of the allowable cuts.
1:29:07
Did you manage to get that through?
1:29:09
Yeah.
1:29:09
And was Bob Tarrant a signer on that?
1:29:12
Yeah, Bob Tarrant.
1:29:13
[Chuckle]
1:29:13
That was just before he retired, wasn’t it?
1:29:15
Oh yeah, all these people were doing great things for us
1:29:19
just before they retired.
1:29:20
Bob Tarrant was the mentor for Jerry Franklin and me.
1:29:25
I knew people in the Forest Service, and he and Jim Trappe were the best
1:29:29
writers and best thinkers of broad ideas.
1:29:34
Jerry Franklin and I were young scientists at that time and we were
1:29:38
looking at these two guys as really being exemplary, in different ways.
1:29:43
But exemplary types of people
1:29:49
that, maybe they weren’t our direct mentors.
1:29:51
I had other mentors, but they really were important.
1:29:54
They’re both good writers and both of them have edited, particularly
1:29:58
Tarrant, some of my stuff when I was trying to reach a more general
1:30:01
audience and not get too political.
1:30:05
He would help me on that.
1:30:06
So, he was really important.
1:30:09
That was while he was director?
1:30:10
[PNW Station]
1:30:10
No, that was before he was director.
1:30:10
I wouldn’t think he’d have time.
1:30:10
Oh no.
1:30:16
We’d still talk, but he had all kinds of problems in trying to
1:30:19
move people off the payroll and all kinds of really difficult things.
1:30:23
There were a lot of changes here at that time, ‘78 or somewhere in there,
1:30:30
‘78 to ‘80,
1:30:40
as you moved into the FSL.
1:30:40
[Forest Sciences Laboratory/USFS-Corvallis]
1:30:40
Well, sometimes I had split things where I would do one out of one building
1:30:43
and have an office here and there.
1:30:45
But most people moved.
1:30:47
I had an office over there, too.
1:30:53
As I’ve moved each time, the office has gotten smaller.
1:30:57
At one time, I had a huge lab with all my reprints and everything
1:30:59
around it, and now I’m down to the smallest office I think I’ve ever had.
1:31:04
Was there a reason why you moved over here instead of staying in the FSL?
1:31:09
There’s a lab at the end of the hall, and another office.
1:31:17
Those were the only ones available to put physiological equipment and not
1:31:20
have direct access to it on weekends and evenings when the Forest Service
1:31:27
is shut down and the power is off.
1:31:28
The
1:31:37
Forest Service had a lot of constraints.
1:31:39
They used to turn the power off and the Xerox machine when you’re
1:31:41
working on grants on the weekends.
1:31:43
This will bring you to your knees right away.
1:31:48
It’s their policy, but we were supposed to be in these joint buildings.
1:31:53
So we had choices; maybe moving, maybe not moving.
1:31:58
But there was an office, this place where the graduate students worked
1:32:01
away, there was room to put the equipment to be shared, and I could
1:32:05
have somebody in there that I knew would take care of the instruments.
1:32:08
So, rather than having them trashed or lost, it was an advantage here.
1:32:17
I teach with Kermit Cromack, he’s over there.
1:32:22
Probably most of my associates now are in Atmospheric Science and
1:32:26
Soils across campus anyway, and
1:32:33
Kate Lajtha, she’s in Botany.
1:32:36
I’ve always been campus-wide.
1:32:39
This department has actually been taken out of Forest Management
1:32:42
and made into Forest Science.
1:32:43
In the last ten years or so it’s gotten more into management and co-ops
1:32:48
and things that are not science.
1:32:50
They’re not advancing the field of science, they’re applying
1:32:53
the things from science.
1:32:54
So, it’s sort of a hybrid, anyway.
1:32:56
And I could work either place, but my loyalty is to the campus.
1:33:04
Do you have a pretty strong connection to the geosciences?
1:33:06
Oh, yeah,
1:33:08
oceanographers I know.
1:33:10
We’ve had joint seminars with them with NASA money.
1:33:13
We’ve written grants to bring satellite downlinks here with Atmospheric Science.
1:33:23
It’s a whole university, and with Forest Science, particularly the part that has
1:33:28
to go correctly into extension and co-ops,
1:33:35
that, almost by definition, is not advancing the field of science or scaling.
1:33:39
It’s trying to meet the client’s needs, the local part
1:33:41
of Oregon, almost one-on-one.
1:33:44
Nothing wrong with that.
1:33:46
It’s
1:33:51
not good, necessary for either one to do it that way.
1:33:53
Once you do it that way, you’ve pretty well made a split.
1:33:56
And you and I don’t think it’s an ideal split, at all.
1:34:00
But when somebody makes that thing, the system says, well, you’re co-op
1:34:03
full time, and you’re extension full time, and maybe you’re going to do
1:34:07
research and have graduate students.
1:34:09
That’s not the same kind of research to find how to get this species of this
1:34:13
seedling or genus type to survive in this soil and under this management
1:34:16
scheme, than it is to say what principles can we go around the world on?
1:34:24
It’s the difference between researching the best buy on something, or
1:34:30
the best option you have for an investment, or the best refrigerator.
1:34:36
What principle could we find to cool food that didn’t require putting it in a box?
1:34:42
It’s a completely different kind of question.
1:34:46
The tools you use, the analytic techniques you use, the audience you
1:34:49
use, and where you get your money from, they don’t overlap, initially.
1:34:54
Later, if they work, everything comes back together.
1:35:00
You moved over here then early in the early ‘90s, is that right?
1:35:03
Yeah, I must have just come back from a sabbatical at NASA headquarters and
1:35:08
they had all my stuff out in the hall, with about half of it not going to fit.
1:35:13
And somebody from the Forest Service had moved into my other office, and
1:35:20
I didn’t quite swear never to go back to the other building again,
1:35:22
but it wasn’t the greatest thing.
1:35:26
Yeah, I’m starting with only three months here since I got on this grant.
1:35:30
‘92, ‘93 so it must have been, must have been ‘92 or something, yeah.
1:35:36
Pretty recent.
1:35:37
Yeah, they changed the locks and the name on my door already.
1:35:39
[Chuckles]
1:35:41
Ooooh?
1:35:42
That’ll tell
1:35:47
you something.
1:35:47
I was interested to hear
1:35:51
a phrase that Jerry Franklin used when I was talking to him.
1:35:53
He said that you opted out of the Andrews in 1978-79.
1:35:56
Is that a fair characterization of your history?
1:36:01
Yeah, I would say, but there’s some reasons for the opting out.
1:36:05
One is we thought we’d picked good people to carry on.
1:36:09
Two, my dad said once you delegate, don’t go back and try to tell them how
1:36:13
to do work the way you would do it.
1:36:15
I would
1:36:18
have one-hour meetings, for example, with an agenda for one-hour meetings.
1:36:23
That doesn’t mean you’re wrong, that just means that’s better than the
1:36:26
way I would do it, and for lots of reasons I wouldn’t do it any other way.
1:36:29
Well, partly, I’ve got other things to do.
1:36:31
Uh-huh.
1:36:34
Delegating.
1:36:35
Oh yeah, we had people we thought were ready for it, and if we didn’t
1:36:39
give it to them then, you know, like the “King of England.” You wait
1:36:44
too long and then they’re not ready, and then they’re “yes” people.
1:36:49
They were ready to do it.
1:36:51
Who’re you talking about?
1:36:52
Fred.
1:36:53
Yeah, Fred [Swanson] was the major one.
1:36:54
We had hope
1:36:58
for some other ones too, but Fred’s taken the major responsibility.
1:37:03
Susan Stafford has taken quite a bit, and certainly made a success.
1:37:12
Without her there wouldn’t be a quantitative science center.
1:37:15
Okay?
1:37:15
Yeah, right.
1:37:16
She’s a great teacher, she’s given her life to service there,
1:37:19
and hopefully, she is recognized now for her outstanding service.
1:37:27
She was also working for a vice president at one time, and she also
1:37:31
was in Washington, D.C. So she got some recognition, but service jobs are
1:37:37
sort of like, everybody wants more.
1:37:40
That’s through NSF.
1:37:41
Yeah, right.
1:37:52
How would you characterize your involvement with the Andrews group since
1:37:55
you have distanced yourself from it?
1:37:59
I think wherever I can really help them, we’ve come back together.
1:38:06
And I think the biggest example, and Fred wrote me a note thanking
1:38:09
me so I remembered what this was.
1:38:12
When I was at NASA headquarters, I helped to arrange a workshop where NASA and
1:38:17
LTER people got together and began to share ideas of collaboration and money
1:38:24
shifted mostly from NASA, into LTER.
1:38:33
I’ve gone on annual field trips occasionally to see what they’re doing.
1:38:40
But it seems like a lot of it is very long range, waiting for the storm years out
1:38:46
so that we finally got to test the ideas.
1:38:54
My research career is built on three years of measurements and two years
1:38:59
of analysis, and I’ve run out of time.
1:39:03
I’ve gotten an awful lot done this way, and felt really
1:39:06
good about the LTER going on,
1:39:10
but it would be different if I were in it, because it would be much more functional
1:39:15
models and much more experimentation.
1:39:17
But the Andrews is a very hard place to do the experimental models.
1:39:21
Some of them, I mean, you can change some things, but you can’t change all of them.
1:39:28
And finally, because it’s very, very undulating land where you
1:39:33
can’t have lots of replications, and [there’s a challenge with]
1:39:36
the permit system.
1:39:37
Because it is so sacred, the land now, what to do with it?
1:39:41
It’ll take you two years to get all the agreements and all the permits.
1:39:45
Well, we can go off onto other Forest Service land.
1:39:50
We can get agreements in six months or something and we’re thinking of
1:39:54
doing that in some of the other areas.
1:39:56
It’s just sometimes easier to go ahead and do the experiments off the Andrews,
1:40:01
and not get in the way of other people.
1:40:03
Especially, if they have to be big experiments, if you have to
1:40:05
dump fertilizer from the air.
1:40:08
You want to make sure you dump it into something uniform,
1:40:11
not into the stream, and
1:40:14
so forth.
1:40:14
So you’re
1:40:15
-- No animosities at all.
1:40:19
I see a lot of the people at the national meetings, the ESA meetings.
1:40:23
But, I don’t go to most of the seminars.
1:40:27
You’re involved then with the decisions about how to manage the forest?
1:40:30
Oh, none.
1:40:31
No, when I left [chuckle] the site director position, I knew I was not
1:40:36
going to enter into any more decisions on how it’s managed
1:40:38
and the making of the decisions.
1:40:42
That’s a different position.
1:40:45
My father warned me about those kind of situations – don’t go
1:40:48
back and help make the decisions.
1:40:51
You were making the decisions, don’t step down and then…
1:40:57
Oh, if you were going to look at the scope of your first involvement there to the
1:41:02
present, what would you characterize as being the period of closest integration?
1:41:07
When I was site director.
1:41:10
That’s you, but I mean
1:41:11
-- Oh, closest integration?
1:41:13
Forest Science people and the management out there when they were working?
1:41:18
Oh, I think they’ve still done some very close coordination.
1:41:22
Mark Harmon and Phil Sollins and Kermit Cromack, these
1:41:30
are people I know intimately.
1:41:31
They’re
1:41:35
all Forest Science [Department, OSU] , and yet they’re working with
1:41:38
people like Tom Spies on the modeling.
1:41:42
That’s not all on the Andrews.
1:41:47
Dave Perry had a project up there.
1:41:48
He’s retired now, he was up there.
1:41:51
I don’t know how many graduate students.
1:41:54
And they take my ecosystem course.
1:42:01
I think we have a hundred graduate students now, so almost by definition,
1:42:05
if a third of those work on the Andrews, then this is our highest integration.
1:42:11
But on the day-to-day meetings when we were actually moving ideas and people
1:42:15
around, we were doing an awful lot of that with the post-docs back in the IBP,
1:42:21
then also, shortly after the LTER started.
1:42:26
Then, we still had full-time post-docs.
1:42:29
They weren’t off teaching and doing other things.
1:42:32
Post-docs do an awful lot of integration.
1:42:34
I think if you’ve got sixty hours a week out of them on one project; that’s a lot.
1:42:42
The graduate students work with them, and hopefully, that’s still happening.
1:42:47
I know some professors have 10 or so graduate students.
1:42:52
I’ve had 21 in 33 years, so you can imagine if 4 or 5 of those can’t do
1:42:59
the same kind of integration, when you as the professor have 10 graduate
1:43:02
students or 50 people in the classes, four classes, as you can when you
1:43:06
have no more than 5 graduate students at one time, usually only three, and
1:43:09
you’re working with three post-docs.
1:43:13
You can’t compare those
1:43:16
things.
1:43:17
Tell me something about post-doc workers who might be more interested in talking.
1:43:23
Because we hired them with another background than what
1:43:26
we’re actually asking them to
1:43:31
do.
1:43:31
And we’re asking them to do integration, to cross fields.
1:43:37
We would do that on the grounds that there is opportunity in cross-field work
1:43:40
there wouldn’t be in their own field.
1:43:43
Because we’re asking them to make a career adjustment, not a shift, an adjustment.
1:43:50
You don’t do that lightly.
1:43:51
My students now are going more with atmospheric science,
1:43:57
remote sensing, and stable isotopes people.
1:44:01
Because there’s tremendous opportunities in those fields compared to classical
1:44:07
forest ecology, classical tree physiology, which are basically very, very limited.
1:44:15
You’re talking about employment opportunities now?
1:44:17
Employment opportunities, and also intellectual opportunities.
1:44:20
Because this integration is still yet to be done.
1:44:23
And most of the things that biologists do in science, with a few lovely
1:44:30
exceptions, they do through integration.
1:44:33
We don’t do the best physics, we don’t do the best math, we don’t
1:44:36
do the best computer programming.
1:44:37
Now
1:44:40
what we do, is we see opportunities to use those tools in a theoretical framework
1:44:44
that maybe other people have talked about, but not actually pulled together.
1:44:48
And partly because of the original background as naturalists, our heritage,
1:44:56
that caused us to write in prose that people might still feel akin to.
1:45:04
If we take that prose and we begin to explain how those isotopes move around
1:45:07
and use some analogy, like remote sensing eyes in the sky, and what they
1:45:12
can see through and this kind of thing.
1:45:13
Well then the people that are interested in this and its importance, they may
1:45:19
understand it much more from that perspective than if an engineer wrote or
1:45:25
a detailed super competent scientist in that kind of field.
1:45:31
Ecologists, in particular, have this challenge to integrate.
1:45:34
But to do it, they have to have enough math, physics, chemistry and English, or
1:45:38
you fill in the foreign language to do it.
1:45:41
That’s the training that we try to give at least some of our students
1:45:46
because that’s where the opportunity is.
1:45:47
And then you don’t have to say, well, it’s stable isotopes and it’s remote
1:45:50
sensing, it’s in the integration and not being afraid to talk to the
1:45:55
people that have this fundamental background in physics, math, chemistry.
1:46:00
A lot of ecologists don’t have that background.
1:46:03
In fact, I’m afraid that most ecologists don’t have physical chemistry.
1:46:07
And it puts them at a tremendous disadvantage.
1:46:11
Difficulty communicating with these specialists.
1:46:14
Yeah, and to even work with the specialists because they’re having to dumb
1:46:18
down the principal ideas and the original references to talk to you as a colleague.
1:46:24
Well, we all expect some of that, I mean, thank God.
1:46:29
But we at least should say, oh, we need to be able to communicate a little
1:46:33
bit other than just superficially.
1:46:36
That takes a lot of learning, continuous learning.
1:46:41
If we can train for that, then we have a really good generation of scientists.
1:46:47
I think my students could all do this much better than I can, but I
1:46:51
know the reason why it’s important.
1:46:57
Why do you think the students, your students, are better at this?
1:47:00
Well, I’ve had students that had lots and lots of forestry background, and
1:47:05
they come here with statistics and correlation matrixes and these things.
1:47:09
After I sit down and ask them, “What am I doing wrong? Because you’re
1:47:13
talking a completely different kind of science than I’ve ever been trained
1:47:16
in the forestry school.” They might say, “Oh, you’re right.” So we’ll
1:47:20
sit down, and for three months, we’ll do philosophy of science. I’m not a
1:47:25
philosopher, but I have some of the books.
1:47:29
I know the standards of it, and we can read some of these things and see how
1:47:34
people from different religions work
1:47:37
in different fields at different levels, and how ideas come together
1:47:42
when they’re right, but not before.
1:47:46
You can see what’s an important idea and one that’s testable now.
1:47:51
And does it make any difference?
1:47:53
It makes a difference if the international audience at this
1:47:55
time thinks it’s different.
1:47:56
Does it make any differences to people in forestry in Oregon?
1:48:00
Maybe, but probably not.
1:48:04
The big problems in insect outbreaks and disease outbreaks are that we don’t know
1:48:08
enough before they happen to solve them.
1:48:10
So, you pour all kinds of money on them.
1:48:11
All right then, you don’t have a serious test.
1:48:13
You’re sort of discovering who killed what, but you don’t
1:48:17
have a fundamental theory.
1:48:19
Do the theory first, try to find these general principles, and then see
1:48:22
whether or not they work everywhere.
1:48:26
You actually give them examples, and in your research you try to
1:48:29
do this to your limited ability.
1:48:32
Well, they’re starting out fresh, coming in often without a forestry background.
1:48:40
This makes them scientists, from the start.
1:48:43
And I never had that advantage.
1:48:46
But I wouldn’t give up my forestry background, because I see a lot of
1:48:49
the opportunities for application.
1:48:51
I
1:48:54
had a very broad training at Minnesota in hydrology, wildlife,
1:48:59
meteorology and all these things.
1:49:00
I never thought I’d use any of it.
1:49:02
Turned out I used all of it.
1:49:04
So, when you’re looking for a graduate student - you’re not looking for
1:49:06
them now, but when you were – you were looking outside of forestry?
1:49:07
Definitely, almost entirely, and almost all outside of Oregon.
1:49:07
Outside Oregon, the region, the Northwest region?
1:49:07
I’d take them from the University of Washington or from
1:49:22
California.
1:49:24
It wasn’t anything malicious.
1:49:26
I have had graduate students from
1:49:33
Oregon.
1:49:34
The qualities that seem to do best are the intellectual rigor of the Northeast,
1:49:44
the ethics and the working habits of the Midwest, and sort of the laid-back
1:49:49
kind of a thing like it’s not a crisis, we’ll get it done, of the Far West.
1:49:55
If you drop any one of those out, you know, it’s not fun to work with
1:50:01
them.
1:50:01
Does that make sense to you?
1:50:03
Three different institutions probably come here, it sounds like.
1:50:06
I’ve had people sent to me that have worked at different institutions.
1:50:10
Most of the time once you get up in your career, the graduate students
1:50:15
that are applying for your Ph.
1:50:16
D., they know your literature, they know your reputation and other people.
1:50:20
What you’re trying to find out is are they thinking already?
1:50:24
Are they open to thought, or are they technically an expert?
1:50:27
Because there are great technical experts around.
1:50:29
I can’t help them much, make them a better programmer, make
1:50:32
them a better remote sensor.
1:50:33
All I can is say, this too may be important here.
1:50:38
What I want to test is, what do you think is going to happen and why?
1:50:43
What’s the basis for that?
1:50:45
What do you think we measure?
1:50:46
What will we find?
1:50:48
You may be wrong, but I want to see that kind of thought process.
1:50:52
And how do we do it?
1:50:54
Where do we do it?
1:50:55
Those are details.
1:50:58
How
1:51:02
would you characterize the work that’s been done and being done at
1:51:07
the Andrews by the Andrews group now?
1:51:11
I think it falls within a
1:51:15
philosophical framework of science with the ideas of trying to scale
1:51:20
it, and make it applicable elsewhere.
1:51:22
But
1:51:30
I would think an awful lot of it is still empirical.
1:51:34
And lots and lots of measurements, and lots and lots of comparative
1:51:37
measurements, comparative physiology isn’t bad either, and comparative
1:51:40
genetics, and comparative that.
1:51:42
But, we get into trouble in real important fields like biodiversity.
1:51:48
We can describe it, we can show where it’s rich and then
1:51:51
we can speculate on why it is.
1:51:52
But we need testable hypotheses that can predict before we make the
1:51:56
measurements what the diversity’s going to be and where it’s going to change.
1:52:01
And then we’ll begin to feel a little more solid about using the GIS maps to decide
1:52:06
where we’re going to put a preserve that may or may not change with the climate.
1:52:13
That
1:52:16
doesn’t mean that biodiversity isn’t important.
1:52:17
Good grief, it’s one of the keynote things in the ecological society.
1:52:22
But it’s
1:52:25
one of those things that’s not easy to approach in clean scientific ways yet.
1:52:31
I’d like to see more theory and less empirical measurements, or the
1:52:35
theory coming before so rather than say, let’s say variants which you’re
1:52:39
familiar with, we’re going to lay out a treatment, or we’re going to
1:52:42
look at things and we’re going to see whether there are differences among
1:52:47
treatments, or you fill in the blanks.
1:52:48
Believe me, if we go far enough, I’ll guarantee they’ll be
1:52:50
differences among treatments.
1:52:51
This is not advancing science.
1:52:53
Science asks, why will there be differences and how will the
1:52:56
response surface change over time, and over space and environment?
1:53:01
Now we’re seeing what would happen over any environment,
1:53:04
over any time, over any space.
1:53:07
That’s a different perspective.
1:53:09
It’s a different way of approaching science.
1:53:11
Initially, forestry had to do the empirical work; they haven’t had a choice.
1:53:16
The trees are growing, the trees are dying, they’re trying to understand why.
1:53:18
Without understanding photosynthesis and growth, other than the names, they had
1:53:23
to go do it.
1:53:24
I think we’re reaching the stage in many of these fields where the
1:53:28
theory and the methods, if we worked on it, would come to the fore.
1:53:33
And I can’t think of a better group that hasn’t had all this empirical experience
1:53:37
to try to step back and begin to do that.
1:53:40
But,
1:53:43
you’re committed every hour of the day every week to do and perform empirical
1:53:47
measurements, especially since you have storms now, because now you
1:53:49
expect that things are going to change.
1:53:52
We’re going to quantify how those things change.
1:53:57
But, do we have a theory of where we should have expected the change, and how
1:54:01
much and what rate they will come back?
1:54:03
Well, to some degree we do.
1:54:05
We have succession theory and we have disturbance theory.
1:54:09
But, those work at very broad levels.
1:54:13
They tell you alder will come in along the stream, but they
1:54:16
don’t tell you how many alder.
1:54:17
When
1:54:21
we make the measurements really detailed, we actually get backed
1:54:24
up on how many alders there are.
1:54:27
Where the question is sometimes best tested looking back and saying, “Well,
1:54:32
it’s hardwoods that grow fast versus slowly developing evergreens that
1:54:37
grow slowly, and this is the reason why.” It’s a different philosophy
1:54:42
that still requires measurements, and I’m not against measurements.
1:54:46
I certainly don’t see that, even in the present hydrology program, which
1:54:50
I’ve sort of put my nose in because students have been taking my class.
1:54:55
Lots of good statistical correlations which locally should show
1:54:59
something, and maybe regionally.
1:55:00
But, I don’t know what the reasons are for those statistical correlations.
1:55:07
The initiative that
1:55:14
was applied.
1:55:15
Well, that’s fine.
1:55:16
I
1:55:18
think the strength of it is right around the Andrews, and that should work.
1:55:23
I’d always like to have more second-growth and more “herbicided”
1:55:26
areas and things that are not being done on the Andrews. There is no
1:55:34
“herbiciding” on federal lands.
1:55:36
You’re trying to advise what will happen without having that in your context, so
1:55:40
you need to broaden it to contain the full range of options that are now being
1:55:44
used, whether or not you agree with them.
1:55:46
Okay?
1:55:47
I mean, that’d be one thing.
1:55:50
The other thing is, if you said that you needed huge amounts of woody debris,
1:55:54
based on the Andrews, and you went up to Alaska and found huge amounts
1:55:58
of woody debris actually lead to degradation of the site, and you read
1:56:02
in California, it leads to fire hazards.
1:56:04
Well, if you only had the Andrews to make this judgment on, you’d include one
1:56:10
thing and you would exclude the other two options, which means let’s get rid
1:56:14
of the debris up here and let’s let the fires burn this up here, because
1:56:16
otherwise we got a fire hazard from hell.
