00:01
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Forest Ecosystems
00:05
and Society Department, College of Forestry, Oregon State University.
00:09
I am here on August 26, 2016 in the home of Gordon Reeves, Research
00:17
Aquatic Ecologist for the PNW Station of the U.S. Forest Service.
00:22
We are going to do an oral history interview recording today that is part
00:27
of a project being sponsored by the PNW Station [U.S. Forest Service] , and we
00:31
are going to be talking mostly about the Northwest Forest Plan, which is the
00:35
focus of this oral history project, but also about Gordie’s life and career.
00:38
Why don’t we get started right away?
00:40
Anyway, hello Gordie.
00:41
How are you?
00:42
Just great.
00:43
Very well.
00:46
Start as basic as you can.
00:48
Where were you born and raised?
00:49
Well, I was born in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada, and raised
00:53
in Niagara Falls, New York.
00:56
And what was your childhood like in relation to the natural world?
01:00
Oh, we spent a lot of time outside.
01:03
It was weekends going places to camp and fish, and then I almost
01:10
fished almost every day during the summer, places around Niagara Falls.
01:14
We’d ride our bikes and walk to them, and spend the whole day by a river.
01:20
Was the place in Canada just on the other side of the border?
01:22
It was.
01:23
It was directly right across from the falls.
01:24
[Niagara]
01:24
Okay, so when you talk about it, you were literally in the same
01:26
neck of the woods, both times?
01:27
Yeah.
01:28
It was like going from here to Linn County [adjacent to Benton County,
01:32
locale of Corvallis] , going across the bridge and you were in Canada.
01:35
What experiences did you have when you were young that got you
01:39
interested in nature and science and what you became as a professional?
01:43
It was just always enjoying being outside and being in places that were not crowded.
01:53
A lot of trees and water.
01:56
It just felt really good.
01:59
What were some of your favorite places in either the Canadian or the New York side?
02:02
There are
02:05
a couple places that come to mind immediately.
02:07
Algonquin Park in northern Ontario.
02:11
I used to go there most summers and canoe and camp.
02:17
With the Boy Scouts, we used to go down into the southern tier [local term for
02:20
southern part of western New York] in New York, into the Allegheny Mountains, and do
02:24
a lot of camping and fishing down there.
02:27
Were you always fascinated with the water?
02:30
Oh, totally.
02:31
In the sense that, obviously, your career became water-based?
02:35
Yeah,
02:37
yeah.
02:38
I always had an interest in
02:41
rivers.
02:43
And I had an aunt, who was—she was an old-maid, my Aunt Rose.
02:47
We’d go visit her on Friday nights up in Canada, and she would take me down to the
02:51
river to catch “minnies,” as she would say, and we’d fish for yellow perch.
02:56
And that was like a highlight of the week, to go up and get Aunt Rose, and
03:03
go down to the river and fish with her.
03:11
When young, what did you notice about land and natural resource management in
03:15
your home region that made an impact on you, maybe that set something up in your
03:21
mind; I like that, I don’t like that, or
03:26
--? In upstate New York, and particularly Western New York, it was very industrial.
03:32
The places that weren’t strongly affected were scarce, as everything was affected
03:37
back East and in that part of New York by
03:42
some type of human activity.
03:45
Even on the farm land, there was always patches of woods, and that’s it.
03:50
I remember the deer and the pheasants.
03:50
That was the thing
03:54
that always used to capture my fascination, these little patches
03:59
somewhere out in the field, you’d go there, and invariably there were
04:03
white-tail deer and ring-necked pheasants.
04:06
Then, as I got a little older and started being able to go to Ontario
04:11
and see that northern Ontario was not developed, just the enormity of
04:22
it, the scale of these lakes and how neat it was to be able to fish
04:27
in them and just walk around them.
04:29
Basically, up on the Canadian Shield up north.
04:31
Right?
04:31
Shield, yeah, exactly.
04:32
Yep.
04:34
So, being around that area at that time, pre-environmental age, what do
04:40
you remember about pollution and water and what you were told, you can’t
04:44
swim there or that kind of thing?
04:46
Well, it was interesting because we would play hockey in the wintertime,
04:53
and looked for areas that were frozen.
04:57
Any spot that had frozen water on it, we’d gravitate to it
05:01
and use it as long as we could.
05:03
There were some places
05:06
around plants, these various industrial plants in our
05:11
neighborhood that never froze.
05:15
Or if they did, it was always just a very thin layer, and
05:19
it was like, that’s not water.
05:23
[Laughs] There’s something going on there.
05:25
It was a little bit too chemically-altered to freeze at normal temperatures?
05:30
Exactly.
05:30
And then, my dad was a millwright, and he worked in a carbon factory.
05:38
You could just see the toll that whole lifestyle took on people.
05:45
Most everybody, all the men in our neighborhood, their desire was to make
05:51
it to 65, so they didn’t have to work.
05:51
And many of them didn’t, and those who did, didn’t last very long past 65.
05:56
Was that because of the toxic environment they were exposed to when
06:00
there really weren’t many protections for citizens and workers alike?
06:04
Yeah, totally, totally.
06:07
Interesting.
06:10
When did you first travel out West?
06:14
I had never been west of Pennsylvania until we moved.
06:18
My wife and I moved to Arcata, California, to go to grad school in 1976.
06:25
So, you were really an easterner?
06:26
Oh, totally.
06:29
And I’d spent a lot of time in northern Maine, into New
06:34
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Quebec.
06:39
But I had never been west of Pennsylvania until I was 22 or 23-years-old.
06:44
When I met you, Gordie, I was trying to figure out your accent.
06:47
It wasn’t quite Boston, but it wasn’t quite New York.
06:52
It’s western New York.
06:53
Western New York.
06:54
That flat A?
06:58
Now I know, thank you.
07:01
So you did not come out west until later.
07:03
What was the first thing that you remember about the West?
07:08
What places made an impression?
07:09
Well, having never been to the West, I remember we were driving,
07:17
and it was in a Volkswagen bug.
07:20
We had everything we owned either on it or in that bug, and in fact, whoever wasn’t
07:26
driving, had to put a box in their lap.
07:27
You drove across the country in a Volkswagen bug?
07:30
That’s a great story.
07:32
Yeah.
07:33
I remember seeing a sign for Denver, a day-and-a-half into the drive, and
07:38
I thought, “Well, God, California can’t be that far.” You know, because
07:43
Colorado was “the West” in my mind.
07:47
Then we realized, we weren’t even halfway.
07:49
We were about halfway across the country.
07:51
How did your bug do over the passes in Colorado that go up to almost 12,000 feet?
07:56
Well, we drove in third gear for the whole day.
07:59
And our engine didn’t last very long once we hit Arcata.
08:04
You really torched it on that trip, didn’t you?
08:06
Oh, we did.
08:07
We pushed it way beyond its limits.
08:10
I blew a valve six months after we got to Arcata.
08:15
So you were an undergraduate.
08:17
What was your training in?
08:19
In biology, a liberal arts degree in biology.
08:21
At what university?
08:22
It was at the State University of New York College at Oswego.
08:26
Okay.
08:27
That was right on Lake Ontario.
08:29
Isn’t that the Finger Lake area?
08:30
No, it was right on Lake Ontario.
08:32
Oh, Ontario, okay.
08:32
Yeah, directly north of Syracuse.
08:35
The dorm was literally twenty feet from a lake.
08:37
The dorm I lived in on the campus was right on the lake.
08:43
What took you out west in terms of the program at Humboldt State?
08:48
I always wanted to go west.
08:50
And there was a fellow where I worked at a research lab on campus after I graduated,
08:56
and the fellow who was the physical oceanographer, he came from Humboldt.
09:06
He was working at that lab.
09:08
I was telling him, I would really like to go into fisheries, and he said, “Oh,
09:13
you’ve got to go to Humboldt State.” And I didn’t even know where Humboldt State was.
09:19
I was working in northern Maine that summer and I submitted an application
09:24
to Humboldt State, and I hadn’t even looked on a map as to where it was.
09:26
It was in northern California.
09:27
I knew it wasn’t San Francisco, so I thought, “Well, okay,
09:31
that should be fine.”
09:32
This is when you looked on the map and said, “Eureka, I have found it.”
09:35
I found it, exactly.
09:36
Sorry, I had to throw that one in.
09:40
[Laughs]
09:40
Well, Eureka, we did find it.
09:43
For you guys on the record, Eureka is the sister city [adjacent] of
09:49
Arcata.
09:49
Exactly.
09:49
I got a call in March on a Thursday night, and
09:56
this fellow said, “My name is Terry Roelofs.
09:59
I just accepted you at Humboldt as a grad student.” And I said, “Great.” He said,
10:04
“But you have to be here next week.”
10:07
So, that’s why this sprint across the country in the bug?
10:09
Yeah.
10:10
So I asked her [wife] , and Meg was literally getting ready to go to bed, and
10:15
I said, “Hey, Meg, you want to move to California?” She said, “Why?” I said, “I
10:18
just got accepted at grad school.” She said, “Sure, let’s do it.” We both said
10:23
yes, and both quit our jobs on Friday.
10:26
After we hung up the phone, we called up friends and
10:29
said we’re going to have a party tomorrow tonight.
10:32
They said, “What are you having a party for?” We said, “We’ve
10:33
moving.” They said, “You’re moving?
10:35
Where are you moving to?” “California.” “No.” We both walked
10:41
in the next day and quit our jobs.
10:45
We had a party that night and we gave almost everything, things,
10:48
stuff we didn’t want, away.
10:53
After people left on Saturday afternoon, we drove down to Meg’s
10:57
family in New Jersey and said goodbye.
11:00
We came home on Sunday.
11:02
My sister and brother-in-law came and helped us, my mother had just
11:06
bought us a new bed, so we were giving the bed back to my mother.
11:08
We moved it to my mother’s house on Monday, and on Wednesday morning, we
11:12
jumped in the car and drove to Arcata.
11:15
We were there on Saturday.
11:18
And I take it, you liked Arcata?
11:22
Here’s the funny thing.
11:22
The plan was, okay, I’ll get my masters and then we’ll go back east.
11:26
We lived in Arcata three days and decided we were as far east [U.S.]
11:30
as we were ever moving again.
11:31
In other words, at least through the Ph.D.
11:33
Yeah, we lived in Arcata for
11:38
about two-and-a-half, almost three years.
11:40
Then Meg went to law school in Eugene,
11:46
I started a Ph.D. program at OSU,
11:50
and we never left.
11:52
Where did you live, Eugene or Corvallis?
11:57
Well, for the first two years, it was Meg’s second year of law
12:00
school when I started school at OSU, so I commuted between
12:08
Eugene and here.
12:10
Be
12:14
in Corvallis during the school year.
12:16
Then during the summer, Meg got a job in Corvallis or in Salem, and we lived here.
12:21
And then in
12:24
May of ’81, we moved here permanently.
12:30
What professor, during either your undergraduate or graduate work,
12:37
made the biggest impression on you, as a person, as a teacher,
12:41
or in terms of theory and content?
12:43
Well, I would point two people out, and they were—well, three people.
12:51
Two of them were at Humboldt, Terry Roelofs and Dave Hankin.
12:56
Terry was my major professor at
13:01
Humboldt, and Terry was going to be on sabbatical and David came
13:05
as a sabbatical replacement, and
13:10
it was just a really cool experience.
13:13
Terry was a really wonderful teacher, but he pushed you to really
13:18
think different, which was neat.
13:20
David,
13:26
he was a biometrician, and the rigor and the demand that
13:29
David had was just incredible.
13:32
It was just one of those things where you wanted to be pushed.
13:36
And the harder David pushed, the harder I worked.
13:39
He would just push.
13:41
He said, “I couldn’t believe how hard I pushed on you, and you didn’t just—”
13:46
Now, when you started graduate school, what did you want to be, and
13:49
at the end, what did you want to be?
13:50
Same question for both.
13:51
How or why did that change during graduate school?
13:54
No, it only reinforced that I had done the right thing.
14:01
So, when I got out of Humboldt,
14:09
I really want to keep going, and had an opportunity.
14:15
I heard Fred Everest talk in a meeting I was at.
14:18
Fred was at the [PNW-USFS] research station, and he was talking
14:22
about a project that he had.
14:25
He was going to look for a grad student to work on this project.
14:28
So, I went up to him after the meeting and said, “Look, I’m here.
14:30
I’ll do it.”
14:31
What was the project?
14:32
Do you remember?
14:32
He was looking at the effect of turbidity.
14:34
He wanted to look at the effect of turbid
14:39
water on the interactions between juvenile steelhead and a native minnow.
14:46
He had done other things with some other
14:50
parts of the study, but he wanted to finish it up with a Ph.D. student.
14:54
And so, I just walked up to him and said, “I’ll do it.” And he said, “Well, come and
14:58
see me.” I said, “When?” I was there the next day, showed him my master’s thesis.
15:05
And he said, “Alright, let me see what I can do.” And
15:09
within a week, I had been accepted at the school.
15:14
Were there any particular places in northern California or the Pacific
15:18
Northwest during that period when you and your wife moved out here, down in northern
15:22
California, but also up here in Corvallis and Eugene, that you started saying,
15:28
this is my place, or I really enjoy this?
15:30
I mean, how did your constellation of places start to develop?
15:34
Well, the first part
15:40
was the Trinity and Klamath Rivers in northern California.
15:47
Terry and David were both avid fly-fishermen.
15:52
So,
15:55
it was like, come on, we’re going to go fishing, for steelhead, and
15:59
I never had never done this before.
16:00
I remember it being like when I was growing up, my dad would
16:03
get Sports Afield, Outdoor Life, and Field and Stream.
16:09
Field and Stream, that’s the one I remember.
16:10
There were three of them, and they came out every month.
16:11
I remember my mom and dad would go shopping on Thursday nights
16:15
because that’s when my dad got paid.
16:17
And the first Thursday of the month, I couldn’t wait till he got home because
16:20
I wanted to look in those magazines.
16:23
The thing that always fascinated me were these guys that were fishing
16:26
for salmon and steelhead in Idaho.
16:29
This was before a lot of the dams were on the Columbia, so these guys needed
16:32
big, black raincoats and black boots, and were holding up these monster fish.
16:37
Back when the fish could actually get up that far?
16:39
Yeah, get up there, exactly.
16:41
And so, it was like, wow!
16:42
I want to see that, and so that always fueled my interest in getting west.
16:49
But once we started doing that, and David [Hankin] would just,
16:56
we were talking about our relationship of the last almost 40 years, about how
17:02
we always were pushing each other to do something more than we would normally do.
17:07
And so,
17:10
David had a class he taught at 8:00 a.m., on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
17:16
And
17:19
the class was over at 8:50.
17:21
At 9:00, he’d pick me up and we’d head off to the Trinity River, and just go explore.
17:26
Did you tie your own flies?
17:27
Yes, I learned to tie my own flies, make my own rods.
17:30
And
17:33
you’re still a big fisherman?
17:34
Oh, yeah, totally.
17:35
Yeah, I can tell.
17:37
In other words, how many times have you read Norman McClean’s book, right?
17:41
[A River Runs Through It]
17:42
Yeah.
17:43
[Laughter] Right.
17:44
And that’s when you’re supposed to say, the movie isn’t quite
17:46
as good as the book, right?
17:47
Well, right.
17:54
How do you think the contrast between where you were raised, the Northeast, and
17:58
here, affected how you saw the landscapes here which were less human impacted,
18:04
but still where issues were happening?
18:06
How do you think that affected the context of how you went into a career of
18:09
science in relation to land management?
18:13
You know what, I think the difference was
18:18
the awe of these systems out here compared to what they are back East, and
18:22
just the wildness of them compared to
18:28
what you see back East.
18:29
And so, it was like, whoa, man, these things are just really wild in terms
18:37
of, not in just how they looked, but you could just see, if you started
18:39
looking around, at how they behaved.
18:43
Any particular streams or places in particular that was like,
18:46
became like your favorite places to go, either play or work?
18:49
Like I said, initially, it was the Klamath and the Trinity.
18:54
But here, up north?
18:55
In Oregon,
19:00
one of the things I was doing as
19:04
a grad student, was helping run field crews and do all of data analysis
19:10
and report-writing for the Forest Service, of the work they were doing.
19:16
So, we got to go over to Cummins Creek on the coast, which was a wilderness area.
19:21
That was my first introduction to a wilderness area.
19:26
And
19:29
you know, it’s on the coast with these monstrous spruce
19:33
and cedar, big Doug firs, and
19:37
big-leaf maples, and the whole bit.
19:40
There were
19:47
landslides everywhere, and these weren’t
19:53
human-caused landslides.
19:54
So, it wasn’t in connection to clear-cutting and that?
19:56
No, no, no.
19:57
It was just like you’d look and say, wow, these systems are really wild.
20:02
It’s also because there’s so much moisture on that slope that you’re going to have
20:06
a lot more earthflows and landslides.
20:07
Yes?
20:07
Right.
20:07
But then, they wanted us within.
20:12
I started school in January of ’80, and then, in May, St. Helens blew.
20:19
And Jim Sedell had come here.
20:23
Jim and I arrived at the lab in January to start school, and Jim arrived in
20:29
March to work at the Forest Service.
20:35
St. Helens blew in May.
20:38
May 18th.
20:39
Yeah.
20:40
And I remember, it was a Friday afternoon, I was walking through the
20:44
lab, and Jim said, “What are you doing?” I said, “What do you mean?” He said,
20:48
“What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m not doing anything.” “Alright, you’re
20:51
with me.” We got in the car, we drove to Portland, got in a helicopter, and
20:56
this was a week after St. Helens blew.
20:59
We got to St. Helens on a Friday, and St. Helens blew the Sunday before.
21:02
Right.
21:02
This was five days after St. Helens blew.
21:04
We were in a helicopter flying over the eruption zone looking for streams.
21:11
Was this the same helicopter with Jerry Franklin, or a different one?
21:15
No, this was—
21:16
Just a different one.
21:17
Right?
21:17
It was a different one, yeah.
21:20
We were allowed to walk around, but we couldn’t go more than just a very short
21:24
distance from the helicopter, and you could see the mountain steaming and stuff.
21:30
Steaming?
21:30
And there were places that you didn’t want to walk, and you had to be careful
21:32
where you stepped, because there was still hot areas underneath the ash.
21:36
It was like, holy mackerel, you can’t be serious.
21:41
This is crazy!
21:43
And it was so wild to see this place completely blown apart.
21:47
And you’d never seen it, of course?
21:48
I’d never seen anything like that.
21:50
But you’d never seen St. Helens before?
21:51
No, not at all.
21:53
It was always the perfect “Fuji-esque” symmetrical cone of the Northwest.
21:56
On the Portland horizon, there was Hood [to the east] and there was
21:59
St. Helens [north across Columbia River] , when I was growing up.
22:01
Oh, wow.
22:02
So you saw those two things, and now it’s like as I describe it, as if
22:06
“God’s meat cleaver” just kind of sliced off one side of St. Helens.
22:10
Right.
22:11
Oh, it was absolutely wild.
22:14
I remember coming home and Meg said, “Where were you?” I said, “You wouldn’t
22:17
believe what I just did.” [Laughs]
22:20
And she said, “Hum, you should have told me.” [Laughs]
22:24
That was in the day before cell phones.
22:27
Was there a bit of trepidation and nervousness in front of this?
22:32
No, I think that it was there, but it was overrun or overwhelmed
22:36
by the pure excitement of being there, and being with Jim and Fred.
22:42
And they were like little kids.
22:43
Fred Swanson?
22:44
[Geologist also involved with MSH Studies]
22:44
No, Fred Everest.
22:45
Fred Everest, okay.
22:47
They were like little kids.
22:49
Wow, I’ve never seen this before.
22:51
There were massive trees all over the place.
22:53
It must have been an overwhelming experience?
22:55
Yeah, and we found sculpin, and it was like, what!
22:57
Found a
23:01
what?
23:01
Sculpin.
23:02
You know, they’re a type of fish, a bottom-dwelling fish.
23:08
They were still alive?
23:09
They were in these streams, you know, and they
23:15
were just amazing.
23:16
Did you see Spirit Lake?
23:18
Yeah.
23:19
Back then it was—
23:20
Spirit Lake, you could hardly see it for all the trees and stuff in it.
23:23
[From eruption, there was a large “log raft” floating on
23:23
an elevated lake surface.]
23:23
Right.
23:26
Yes, we saw Spirit Lake, but did we see much water?
23:31
We didn’t see much water.
23:32
So, were the flowing areas or the places where there were fish, down a little bit
23:35
lower farther away from the mountain?
23:37
No, these were just right at the very base.
23:39
Really?
23:40
Yeah.
23:40
Oh God, it was just amazing.
23:41
It was just absolutely amazing.
23:44
I mean, Jim, he was like,
23:49
he just couldn’t believe what we were seeing.
23:52
Well, not too many people get to see that.
23:54
No, no, it was absolutely amazing.
23:57
Was it also kind of somber because you realized a whole bunch of people died?
24:00
Yeah, there
24:03
was certainly that aspect to it.
24:06
And especially, not on that particular trip, but then we went to later trips
24:11
when we flew all around the area, and you’d get there, and here’s a car,
24:16
you know, just completely charred.
24:19
Or there was a campsite that you could see where the remnants of [people]
24:26
were, and from the heat something was left and you knew somebody was
24:29
like there [in past] . So, that was
24:34
sobering.
24:34
What do you think that did to you, obviously emotionally, but what
24:38
did that do to you intellectually, specifically how it related to
24:41
your career in aquatic biology?
24:43
Well, that was the idea that it really started, the beginning of thinking
24:51
about systems and the common dogma about aquatic ecosystems that they were all
24:57
relatively stable, and that they bounced back to this stable condition if they’re
25:04
perturbed, in a relatively short time.
25:08
You look at this, and say, no way that’s bouncing back in a short time.
25:12
This is going to be a while.
25:14
And I think it’s where Jerry Franklin started thinking about the importance
25:19
of these early successional systems.
25:22
Well, the little colonizers that he found.
25:24
Definitely.
25:24
The little lone species out there on the pumice plain, for instance?
25:30
Where the elk were booming, and fire weed was coming back.
25:33
And so, there was this whole, you could see terrestrially, but there
25:37
were things going on in streams that were equally incredible, you know.
25:43
How did it change the chemistry of the streams?
25:48
Obviously, dramatically.
25:49
Yeah, it had some really significant impacts.
25:53
I’m trying to remember all the numbers, what alkalinity and pH,
25:58
and there were significant changes, but the specifics I don’t remember.
26:06
But I remember Jim just being, like, “holy mackerel.” But, within a short
26:11
time, the aquatic invertebrates were starting to recolonize these areas.
26:17
The tailed frogs were coming back.
26:21
How would you characterize it today?
26:22
I mean, the last time that you’ve been there?
26:26
You know, it’s a going place.
26:33
The big thing was,
26:37
it’s not clear how rainbow trout got into Spirit Lake.
26:43
They were there before, and did they survive or were they introduced?
26:47
But, you know, the rainbow trout population in Spirit Lake
26:50
now, it’s a trophy fishery.
26:54
Is that because they’re really large now?
26:57
Oh, they’re very large, you know, five and six pounds are very common.
27:01
And
27:05
the productivity of that lake has just gone through the roof.
27:09
And why would that be in your view?
27:10
Well,
27:13
you have a tremendous amount of organic material blown
27:18
into or blown onto the lake.
27:21
And it’s decomposing, becoming available to microorganisms and it worked its way
27:29
through the food chains and the plankton.
27:31
It’s
27:34
just a booming place.
27:35
Now that will tail off as that vegetation is used up.
27:41
It will reach a different level of stasis, you mean?
27:44
Right?
27:44
Yeah.
27:46
So, you come out of the St. Helens experience.
27:48
Now, did you stay involved with that or was that just kind of a one-time deal?
27:52
No, I stayed involved for the first couple years with it, with Jim
27:59
going back up on a fairly regular basis to do water chemistry, stream
28:05
surveys, collect fish and so on.
28:10
But I had a dissertation to finish.
28:13
What was your dissertation on?
28:14
I looked at the effect of water temperature on the interactions
28:18
between a redside shiner, which is a native minnow, and juvenile steelhead.
28:26
I built artificial streams at the lab and then I did field work.
28:32
I played around with Jim and Fred for two years at St. Helens, and then I
28:37
decided that, I’ve got to get moving here.
28:41
So, I eased out of the whole thing.
28:46
Where was most of your field work in relation to your dissertation?
28:48
Down on the Umpqua, on the North Umpqua,
28:53
a couple tributaries of the North Umpqua, and then down on
28:57
Cow Creek on the South Umpqua.
28:58
Did you work around Coyote Creek, in that area?
29:03
I did.
29:04
South Umpqua Experimental Forest?
29:06
No, this was down lower.
29:08
Okay.
29:11
So, how did this transition into the Forest Service, how did
29:16
that happen, or were you Forest Service right out of college?
29:20
No, as I said, I went there and when I started with the grad program,
29:28
the Forest Service was sponsoring my research.
29:35
The first summer, I was building artificial streams over at the lab,
29:41
and there was only Fred Everest and Jim Sedell there, but they
29:47
had no field crew and they had one technician.
29:51
So, the agreement was, I would go in the field and help them do their
29:55
work, and then they would help me with building the stream channels.
30:01
When we weren’t in the field, everybody was working on, well, Fred and Carl
30:06
MacLemore, who was the technician, and I, were working on the channels.
30:10
Jim would come down and talk, but he wasn’t much inclined mechanically or
30:15
otherwise to do those types of things.
30:17
But we would work on, we would go back-and-forth, and so I got to see a
30:22
lot of the Coast Range, and then like I say, St. Helens, with those guys.
30:28
I did that, and then the field crew expanded, and eventually
30:33
I ran the field crew
30:37
during the summer while I was doing my own research, plus helped Jim at St. Helens.
30:42
Then I did all the data analysis and report writing for the Forest Service for
30:47
all the work they did during the summer.
30:50
And finally, after doing that for two seasons, Jim said, this
30:53
is unfair, you can’t do this.
30:55
So, they [U.S. Forest Service] gave me
30:59
an appointment as
31:02
a fish biologist, which was called a term appointment, which
31:05
is a temporary appointment.
31:07
And this was in October or November and the first of 1984.
31:16
The first assignment was, they gave me an office and told me I wasn’t
31:21
supposed to come out of the office until my dissertation was done.
31:26
And how long was that, about six months?
31:29
That was about six months.
31:29
That was like November, and I finished in March.
31:32
So, you come out finished in ’85.
31:35
Correct?
31:36
Yeah.
31:36
And you basically went into the Forest Service?
31:40
Well, I was working on a term appointment.
31:43
But I mean, that continued, is what I’m saying.
31:46
Then,
31:49
after I graduated, I still had this appointment and was working with Jim
31:53
and Fred, and started doing some stuff up in southeast Alaska with some folks.
31:57
And then I worked mostly down on the south coast down on the Elk
32:03
River near Port Orford [Oregon]
32:10
. That’s where things really started to happen at Elk River.
32:14
We started seeing these systems and
32:18
how amazingly diverse and dynamic they were, and started thinking about
32:26
how did fish ever persist in this environment.
32:28
And then you start looking at, oh, let’s look at
32:32
histories of an average fish or an average salmon.
32:36
[Sneezes] Excuse
32:40
me.
32:40
Okay.
32:45
We started thinking about things really, really differently as
32:48
a result of that experience.
32:50
I can remember calling Fred and Jim up and saying, “You’ve got to get down there.
32:53
I’ve got to show you this.” It was the north fork of Elk River.
32:57
We had gone in there and
33:01
it was just absolutely amazing.
33:04
There were terraces, fifty and sixty feet stepping terraces, that were fifty or
33:08
sixty feet above the existing stream channel, and there were
33:12
pieces of wood protruding from it.
33:14
And you could see where there had just been this massive hillslope
33:18
failure [landslides] , and it dammed up the whole valley.
33:22
You could see where there was a lake formed.
33:25
And now this was some of the most productive habitat on the whole coast.
33:31
Now, how did your real life experiential knowledge that you were gaining as a young
33:36
professional, compare and/or contrast with the book-learned knowledge that
33:41
you had from undergrad, masters, Ph.
33:43
D.?
33:44
Well, I remember then one of the most exciting lectures I ever heard
33:49
was by Ken Cummins and Jim Sedell.
33:52
I was taking this stream ecology class.
33:55
It was one of the first courses I took when I came and
34:00
went into the Ph.D. program.
34:03
They were talking about the river continuum concept, and
34:07
they had just published on it.
34:08
It was a really neat idea about how streams operate
34:14
in different parts of the [riparian] network.
34:16
But
34:19
out there, I remember talking to Jim and saying, “Jim, the continuum
34:22
doesn’t work.” He said, “What do you mean?” I said, “Look at this system.
34:26
If we had been here fifty years ago, we’d be seeing something very different
34:30
than what we’re seeing right now.”
34:34
So we started talking about how variables of streams and
34:36
forests operate based on time.
34:39
And
34:43
the prevailing dogma was about stability and absence of variability, and yet,
34:49
you get out on the ground, it’s like, whoa, wait a minute, these systems
34:53
are really variable, not just amongst themselves, but even within themselves.
34:58
And so, it really started to spark a wave.
35:03
How did Jim modify his river continuum concept?
35:07
[Concept originated from Robin Vannote of Stroud Water Research
35:09
Laboratory, Pennsylvania.]
35:09
I think Jim started to think that maybe the river continuum
35:13
wasn’t the right concept, that
35:17
it indeed lacked a temporal aspect to it.
35:22
And so, we started thinking about it, and that led to us thinking
35:28
this is really interesting.
35:30
At that time, we were into the “timber wars.”
35:37
[Also called “forest wars”] And the timber wars were not just owls; a
35:39
lot of it was dealing with fish and the concerns about the impact of
35:43
timber management practices on fish.
35:49
You sort of step back and say, “Why are the timber guys saying
35:56
they see it one way, and the fish guys are standing there and they’re
36:01
seeing it in a very different way.”
36:08
You think about it for a little bit and it all has to do with world views,
36:13
which we very seldom ever surface or articulate, and yet, we’ll argue, yes,
36:18
it is, or no, it isn’t, until the cows come home, and we never understand why
36:23
I’m saying yes and you’re saying no.
36:25
And often, I think, much of it has to do about how you view the world.
36:29
So, you’ve got the timber people and the people in general who have this
36:34
view of the world that’s very dynamic, both in space and time, and so change
36:40
is a natural part of your thinking.
36:42
On the other hand, you’ve got the aquatic people, who have paradigms
36:46
shaping their thinking that are all very static and predictable, so
36:51
any change is viewed as negative.
36:54
And so, you’ve got these two groups who are talking to each other, and really
37:01
arguing with each other, who are coming from very different perspectives,
37:06
and yet that never gets articulated, to try to understand those things.
37:12
So, it started us thinking about, okay, what is it that’s really going on?
37:19
Well, it is world-view differences.
37:20
It’s world-views we don’t communicate right.
37:22
But it doesn’t hardly ever get surfaced
37:27
or acknowledged.
37:30
Well, for instance, some science, and especially environmentalists, view an
37:35
idealized nature as having humans removed.
37:39
Right.
37:39
And then they insert themselves, whether it be activism or science, into that,
37:44
but sometimes I don’t think they’re able to reconcile the fact that they
37:48
are humans interfering in the system, even if it’s just intellectually.
37:53
Right?
37:54
Yes, exactly.
37:54
So, anyway, yeah.
37:56
But it was interesting, really interesting, talking, particularly
38:02
with Jim, about this whole thing.
38:06
Like wow!
38:07
This is really
38:09
interesting!
38:10
It provided much better insights into what was going on than I ever had before.
38:16
Now, tell me about, because you were here in the ‘80s
38:20
-- Right.
38:21
Tell me about the “Forest Wars,” and what you saw as a young, up-and-coming
38:26
science guy who just was finishing graduate school, coming out.
38:30
What was it like?
38:31
What did you hear about?
38:33
What did you see?
38:33
What did you feel?
38:34
Oh,
38:38
everything in the science was geared towards to show
38:41
how bad timber harvest was.
38:42
That was really what it was all directed towards.
38:45
There
38:48
was this presumption that timber harvest was negative and had
38:55
no ecological benefits at all.
39:01
So, a lot of the research was geared to support that premise.
39:06
But do you think that was mainly because of the type of timber harvest
39:11
that was dominant [clear-cuts] , versus all timber harvests?
39:15
[Less intensive]
39:15
Well, yeah, I think there were a number of things going on.
39:23
That was part of it, you know, that it was all clear-cutting.
39:27
But underlying that whole controversy was not just the timber
39:35
harvest, as a lot of the real issues about jobs, were about
39:40
automation of the industry.
39:43
The mills were starting to move towards more efficient ways
39:48
of dealing with the lumber.
39:51
It was taking fewer people to produce the same amount of boards.
39:58
There was a growing recognition we were running out of big trees,
40:04
and the social/legal aspects of it as well.
40:11
It was a really cool to be here beginning one’s career.
40:15
Because it was definitely a synergized, energetic, intense time?
40:19
Yeah, right.
40:21
And then mixed into that
40:27
was the whole legal aspect, where, that was at the end of the Reagan
40:32
administration, the beginning of the Bush I administration, and
40:40
those guys were going to cut timber.
40:43
You knew they were going to cut timber.
40:45
Well, Ronald Reagan said, “You’ve seen one tree, you’ve seen them all.”
40:48
We were living in Arcata when he made that statement.
40:51
And you’re in the middle of the Redwoods?
40:53
Yeah.
40:54
That was the end of the era where there was part of one [single]
41:00
redwood [log] on a logging truck.
41:02
But
41:04
it was like they were getting the last of the really big trees.
41:06
On [Route] 101 in Arcata, I can remember either driving or walking across the
41:15
101 bridges, and
41:18
every couple minutes, here came a truck with one piece of wood that covered,
41:24
you know, where the whole trailer was a single-log load on a logging trailer.
41:28
Part of one log.
41:29
Part of one log, exactly.
41:34
Did that make a negative impression on you, or was it more
41:39
--? The other thing going on, it was just before the establishment of
41:43
Redwood [State & National] Park.
41:44
All of the private timber companies were liquidating
41:55
the trees on their land because they knew the Park Service, or
41:58
the government [state and/or federal] , was going to buy the land.
42:01
But you’re talking about the extension of Redwood Park, because ’68 was the
42:04
original, and ’80 was the expansion?
42:05
Correct?
42:05
[Redwood State and National Park – collection of reserves
42:05
on northern California coast.]
42:05
Right, the extension, the expansion, yeah.
42:08
Simpson Timber, and I can’t remember who the other companies were,
42:17
they were cutting trees like there was no tomorrow.
42:23
You could just see that on the highway, and it was all
42:27
in anticipation of the park.
42:31
What would you say that your environmental ethics and philosophy were before you came
42:37
out here, but then, as you developed as a young professional, and viewing these
42:43
things that we’re talking about here?
42:44
Well, I would say, it was the ethics.
42:51
I was developing the ethic back East, I
42:55
think just from some intuitive sense, but it was really hardened, I guess, I
43:03
don’t even know how else to describe it.
43:05
I was reading Sand County Almanac [Aldo Leopold] , a reading
43:11
that Terry [Roelof] had us do.
43:13
Another book, I wish I could remember the name of it.
43:19
It was a series of essays that
43:23
Terry had us read for his fish ecology class, that even more so
43:29
than Sand County Almanac, started
43:33
and really pushed me to really think about the environment, what the environment
43:37
was, and what we were doing, how we were fitting into it or not fitting into it.
43:43
Man, I wish I could remember the name of the book.
43:45
I remember it had a blue cover?
43:48
Was it an anthology, or was it one particular author?
43:51
One author.
43:53
And,
43:57
it’s funny, I was just talking to Ken Cummins about this back in Montana.
44:00
He was talking about the advent of using the bathrooms, of humans having
44:09
indoor plumbing and having bathrooms,
44:14
and forcing us to spend, causing us to spend more time inside than we would have,
44:20
and particularly at all times of the day.
44:23
He was talking about when you had to use an outdoor toilet, you saw more of
44:28
nature and experienced more of nature, because you would be going out there
44:33
at night, you saw something different than you did during the day, but you
44:36
were always having to go outside to do something, to do this particular task.
44:42
And how that was a real interesting idea, that chips away at that
44:47
connectivity that we have.
44:50
So, how did your career develop that first, let’s say, five to
44:54
seven years, before the Northwest Forest Plan process started?
44:59
Yeah.
44:59
In other words, what led into you becoming the person that you were
45:03
professionally, that then got asked to join this massive project?
45:08
Well, we continued.
45:11
We were working in Elk River.
45:17
It was supposed to be a one-year project, and it turned into a twenty
45:20
20-year project, and just because we were starting to pick on these
45:25
dynamics of variability and other stuff.
45:29
Then, we started expanding from there into different parts of the coast.
45:34
That was the real focus
45:40
leading into
45:43
challenging some of the dogma that was there.
45:46
But what happened, one of the things
45:50
that really
45:56
was a very interesting experience; after the first year, either the first or second
46:02
year we worked in Elk River, one of the things we were identifying was the North
46:07
Fork of the Elk River and how incredibly productive it was for a variety of fish.
46:16
The Forest Service was proposing a big timber sale in there.
46:21
This was right at the very end [era of industrial forestry before the
46:23
NWFP] , they were still hanging on [trying to log in national forests]
46:26
. Was this in the redwoods?
46:26
[Zone of species coverage.]
46:26
No.
46:26
This is the Elk River on the Siskiyou National Forest.
46:29
Because you’re north of the main range [of redwoods] , right?
46:34
The Forest Service put out a notice that they were going to have a massive
46:39
timber sale and build roads and the whole thing, in the North Fork [Elk
46:42
River] , and we were starting to get attention for our work down there.
46:48
I had made presentations to various groups, and I was actually asked to
46:54
testify at a congressional hearing on it because it was being considered for
47:02
Wild and Scenic [River] designation.
47:05
So the Siskiyou National Forest was moving ahead with a massive timber sale in there.
47:13
I was asked to come down to meet with [Congressman] Peter DeFazio.
47:19
It was one of his first terms in Congress.
47:21
By the way, he also drives a Volkswagen Bug.
47:23
You know that?
47:23
Oh, I know.
47:23
I had to bring that up because of your car.
47:23
And so, I was asked by—I can’t think of, Bob, Bob,
47:31
what was his name?
47:32
I want to say Bob Weaver.
47:34
Jim Weaver was the guy he replaced.
47:36
Yeah.
47:36
Bob, I can’t remember his name, was his natural resources staffer.
47:39
[Bob Warren] He asked me to come down to meet with him.
47:48
I was really just starting my career in the Forest Service, and
47:56
he said, “I want you to come down to a meeting.” It turned out that he
48:00
had the environmental groups in his office, and the Forest Service, the
48:06
supervisor and the district ranger, were
48:11
there.
48:14
I had never been involved in anything like this before, so I had
48:17
no idea what this was all about.
48:22
So, I go down there, and they are talking about this timber sale.
48:27
The
48:30
forest supervisor was talking, and he said, “Gordie approved this timber sale.”
48:39
But I’m like, I looked at the guy, and it’s like, huh?
48:42
Did you understand that you had approved the timber sale?
48:47
No, not at all.
48:48
Not at all.
48:48
Okay.
48:50
And
48:52
so—
48:54
What environmental law or paradigm would have been necessary for a science
48:58
person to approve to make that okay?
48:59
Well, first of all, a science person, a scientist, can’t approve of anything.
49:05
I know that, but I’m making a point about the background science or
49:08
-- ? Well, I think
49:12
he assumed that I would bless his proposed actions, because I
49:17
worked for the Forest Service.
49:19
And so,
49:27
DeFazio’s aide said to me, “Is that true?”
49:31
I said, “No, it’s not true.
49:34
In fact, that’s a
49:42
really highly erosive area
49:47
of the entire Elk River, and you are likely to have massive erosion events if
49:54
you went in there and logged.” He said, “Do you approve of them logging?” I said,
49:59
“Not my job to approve of them logging.
50:02
My job is to tell them what’s likely to happen or not happen if they do
50:06
it.” He said, “Did you ever [guy’s name was Abel Camareras] tell Mr.
50:13
Camareras that you approved?” I said, “I’ve never had a discussion about
50:18
that at all.” He looked at the guy and
50:24
said, “I’ll tell you what, you go ahead with that sale and your career
50:28
in the Forest Service is over.”
50:32
End of the meeting.
50:34
Well, they tried to go ahead with the sale, and I don’t
50:39
know where that guy ended up.
50:41
Needless to say, he wasn’t your best friend?
50:43
Oh, no, no.
50:45
I got the forest supervisor, he was the acting forest supervisor, who called
50:52
up Fred [Everest] and said, I wasn’t a team player, so on and so forth.
50:56
Fred said, “Look, his job is not to be a team player, his job
51:00
is to give you an assessment.”
51:02
And
51:04
of course, this was the beginning, well, maybe not the beginning, but
51:07
when it was obvious to the typical timber guys, that the “ologists”
51:12
were having more and more of a role.
51:14
Oh, right.
51:15
In terms of how decisions were made.
51:17
Correct?
51:17
Well, it wasn’t just the “ologists.” What was going on is the scientists were
51:24
-- Well, that’s what I meant by that.
51:25
Any scientist.
51:26
Yeah, yeah.
51:27
I used that phrase [ologist] because you hear a lot of people describe that.
51:29
Well, I think there’s a lot of “ologists” in the agency, in the
51:33
management side of the agency.
51:35
But it was the time when the credibility of the Forest Service
51:41
was being severely diminished by the clear-cutting system.
51:44
They were losing suit after suit after suit.
51:50
Pretty soon, they had no credibility.
51:54
So the legal system was turning to the scientists, which
51:57
was what FEMAT’s all about.
51:59
The reason that FEMAT came about is because the agency, the management
52:05
side of the agency, had no credibility, legally or otherwise.
52:11
The court systems and the agencies turned to the scientists to help them get them
52:15
out, you know, to help break that log jam.
52:18
Within the context of environmental laws.
52:20
Exactly.
52:21
Which changed how multiple-use and the traditional mission of the
52:26
Forest Service was interpreted.
52:27
Right, right.
52:27
I mean, sustained-yield and the whole dynamic that was very
52:31
technocratic and economic, had a new paradigm it had to steer towards.
52:38
Right.
52:40
And the agency wasn’t able to do that, or be willing to do that.
52:45
They didn’t do it easily.
52:46
Right.
52:46
That’s what you’re saying.
52:48
How was clear-cutting, and I’ll call it traditional silviculture
52:52
[post-World War II U.S.] , affecting hydrological dynamics and water
52:55
quality in streams, big and small?
53:01
It completely
53:05
alters the way water comes off the landscape, and it alters the
53:09
quality of the water coming off.
53:10
So, instead of
53:16
being held on the land, hitting leaves and the forest, and being held in
53:23
storage with the root systems and everything else, it doesn’t happen,
53:28
so the water is just running off.
53:30
And a lot of that has to do with roads.
53:32
Basically, the road networks that are associated with these management
53:35
activities become streams, a lot of these first-order streams that channel
53:41
water off the landscape faster.
53:43
So, you’re moving the water off the landscape faster, and
53:47
you’re also causing erosion.
53:47
So,
53:53
you’re driving sediments into the stream.
53:54
And the water is much more turbid?
53:57
Well, yeah, with the turbidity.
53:58
You’re talking about your early project, and I’m going back to the turbidity thing.
54:02
So, it was interesting that you studied that, and of course
54:05
it’s a direct by-product, often immediately, after clear-cuts?
54:09
Right?
54:09
Right, yeah.
54:12
So, what were some of the most dramatic examples that you saw early in your
54:16
career before the Northwest Forest Plan?
54:18
Mapleton
54:21
was the big place,
54:25
I remember when I first came on, where there was all kinds of controversy.
54:29
When I first started grad school, and even into the early part of my career
54:33
with the Forest Service, Mapleton was the centerpiece for all of that, for the
54:38
whole clear-cutting effect on fish debate.
54:44
You went over there, and there were massive clear-cuts that you could see were
54:51
changing the whole nature of the way things were operating.
54:55
And this was still at the time when there really was no opposition
54:59
to speak of against clear cuts?
55:02
Oh, I think there was.
55:04
Well, starting.
55:05
It was starting.
55:05
It definitely was starting.
55:07
And it was not just the enviros, as there were people, a lot
55:12
of the so-called “ologists”
55:16
inside the management section of the Forest Service and
55:18
BLM, who fully recognized
55:23
clear-cutting was an issue. This was in the early ‘80s, and it’s hard to imagine,
55:29
but that was when any type of stream protection was just starting to happen.
55:35
We were starting to see, it was the earliest time riparian
55:38
buffers were being implemented.
55:41
Often times, they were either, one, really small, or you could
55:49
do a lot of activity within them
55:53
under the guise of management.
55:55
But it was the beginning.
55:58
It was the beginning.
55:59
You also had recreational fishermen and commercial fishermen concerned
56:04
with the quality of the water and the effect on the fisheries too.
56:08
Correct?
56:08
But that was beginning.
56:11
You know,
56:15
people hadn’t thought about it, and the Clean Water Act really
56:17
hadn’t come into the picture.
56:19
It was in place, but it hadn’t been used that much.
56:22
Yeah, it hadn’t been used, exactly.
56:24
So, there were a lot of things that were starting to emerge and coalesce
56:28
in the mid to late ‘80s around concerns about environmental effects.
56:36
Then you had the rigor of the—like you say, in the last part of the
56:41
Reagan administration and then into the Bush administration, just the
56:45
total resistance to anything but “get the wood out.” Eventually, the court
56:52
systems under the guise of ESA and the owls, began to really challenge the
57:02
agencies about what they were doing.
57:05
What particular examples that you remember, of especially dramatic
57:09
erosion events or water quality issues, in that period of time before the
57:15
Northwest Forest Plan process [Early 1980s to 1993-94] , when you were out
57:19
in the field, either recreationally
57:22
or working?
57:22
I remember where it just really hit home was on Canal Creek, a
57:26
tributary of the Alsea [River]
57:29
. It’s on Forest Service lands
57:33
down toward Waldport near
57:37
Tidewater.
57:37
We were doing surveys in there.
57:41
You went in and the sand and fine sediment in the channels just
57:47
completely overwhelmed everything.
57:50
Like a year before, there had been a lot of activity up above.
57:56
We drove up and you could see the road with the rills in the bank, and the
58:01
gullies on the hillside and everything.
58:03
You’d look down, and
58:08
the thing is, where all the dust sets up, is in the most productive
58:11
areas for fish, which is sort of these flat, low-gradient areas.
58:15
And when it fills in the pools, it affects their spawning grounds and everything?
58:18
Oh, all kinds of stuff goes on, yeah.
58:22
Now, how would you characterize the aquatic habitat stream and water
58:26
quality in a classic old-growth forest?
58:32
The view was that it was the pinnacle of habitat suitability,
58:40
and that there was lots of wood, pools and so on and so forth.
58:47
But
58:52
after walking around the Coast Range and looking at systems,
58:59
we started questioning that.
59:01
I mean, it’s a very interesting history there.
59:05
What that was about, if you look at the history, the importance of
59:10
large wood [terrestrial and streams] originated in the Andrews, and Jim
59:12
Sedell and Fred Swanson really went on a rant of making this known.
59:18
It was also the time when there was a growing recognition about the
59:23
ecological importance of o ld growth.
59:26
It wasn’t just the decadent and barren successional stage
59:30
it had been made out to be,
59:35
as there was all kinds of biodiversity and other stuff going on.
59:37
But the whole old-growth deal, and then, associated with that was the
59:41
assumption the streams are in great shape, or that streams are the type
59:46
of things we want to emulate for fish.
59:49
Again, if we go back and ask, why did we do that?
59:55
Why did we make that assumption?
59:57
Again, it has to do with this idea of stasis or stability.
1:00:00
These are the conditions we think are best.
1:00:05
There certainly is a lot of wood, but there are very few studies that had
1:00:11
looked at other successional stages and the productivity of those for
1:00:17
fish and other aquatic organisms.
1:00:20
So, we ran with this idea that old growth was best, and no one really looked at
1:00:25
what assumptions were being made, what the limitations of those approaches were.
1:00:29
What did you find that those limitations were?
1:00:34
So, there’s two basic building blocks to fish habitat.
1:00:38
It’s sediment, and that’s the range of sediment sizes from small
1:00:42
stuff to big stuff, and wood.
1:00:45
Okay?
1:00:46
So, an old-growth system has a lot of wood in it, but it doesn’t have
1:00:53
a wide range of sediment sizes.
1:00:55
That’s because that system hasn’t been disturbed for a long time.
1:00:58
What we’re learning is that the sediment supply to the streams in
1:01:05
much of the Northwest, are coming in on these very big disturbance events.
1:01:10
A fire followed by landslides or floods, are
1:01:16
bringing in the
1:01:19
sediment in these massive pulses, then the system works with it, erodes
1:01:25
it, and transports that through time.
1:01:29
If you go in an extended time period without this input, you’ve got
1:01:35
lots of wood, but you don’t have much in terms of sediment, or all
1:01:40
you’ve got is the really big sizes.
1:01:42
So, the emerging evidence is that old growth isn’t the panacea for
1:01:47
fish that everybody expected.
1:01:49
It looked like, at least in the Coast Range, and certainly in the Cascades,
1:01:54
that forests about 80 to 120-140 years out from big natural disturbance
1:02:01
events, are indeed the most productive.
1:02:04
You have intermediate amounts of
1:02:08
wood, but they’ve got a lot of pools and complexity provided by the substrates.
1:02:16
Now, if you were going to make a regional assessment, maybe offering an example of
1:02:21
grades, how would you rate the aquatic habitat in the decade or the five years
1:02:27
before the Northwest Forest Plan process?
1:02:31
If you were going to say, here’s an example of good, medium, bad.
1:02:36
Well, I think the one thing is that you’ve got to realize, these systems, we presume
1:02:48
a lot of these things are pristine.
1:02:49
Right?
1:02:53
They were significantly impacted well before logging really kicked into gear,
1:02:59
modern-day logging kicked into gear, by
1:03:04
activities that went on with initial settlement of this area.
1:03:09
One of the first things that happened,
1:03:13
was in river systems, in order to facilitate
1:03:16
transportation and commerce, the
1:03:21
amount of wood that was removed is staggering, dynamited, just
1:03:29
cut up, and so on and so forth.
1:03:32
And in other cases, beaver were trapped out.
1:03:38
Beaver were trapped out of much of Oregon by the 1850’s.
1:03:40
This is a very historical question, because I used to
1:03:44
teach American West history.
1:03:48
One of the things I discussed was how we’ll never know exactly how much the
1:03:53
hydrological dynamics of the whole West, even in the Southwest, was changed
1:03:58
because the beavers were all taken out?
1:04:01
You go back and look at history; Jim Sedell discovered the Secretary of
1:04:06
War records, which included early military surveys done in much of the
1:04:13
West to help the military identify where to establish bases or forts.
1:04:20
You look at them and they have incredibly-detailed records, and
1:04:24
you see that much of this area and the West, was really wet.
1:04:30
It had wet meadows, and there were issues with malaria and other
1:04:33
things because of standing water.
1:04:39
Areas that are dry now,
1:04:44
150 years ago, were totally wet.
1:04:47
A lot of that has to do
1:04:51
with the fact that some of the first activity in it was to trap beavers.
1:04:56
There was a fad in Europe in the 1820’s and ‘30s where beaver pelts
1:05:02
and hats were in vogue, and that literally was the market for it.
1:05:07
Of course, they trapped them out, and then, about the same time in the 1830’s,
1:05:13
early 1840’s, that they were pretty much trapped out, the fad changed.
1:05:17
Right.
1:05:18
But by then, the damage had been done, because they literally stripped the
1:05:22
population [beaver] of a lot of areas.
1:05:24
There wasn’t a sufficient population base in many areas where you
1:05:27
could start a new population.
1:05:28
It was pretty much, I won’t say extinct, but they were close.
1:05:31
Well, it was close.
1:05:34
Yeah, so anyway, continue on.
1:05:37
I’m just saying, we’ve seen massive changes because of that.
1:05:42
And then you look at the first places where people want to settle, they
1:05:46
tend to be valley bottoms near rivers.
1:05:49
And so,
1:05:52
the channels are constrained or moved around.
1:05:58
Even before the 1940’s and 1950’s when things really picked up with
1:06:05
modern-day logging, many of our river systems were heavily altered.
1:06:10
Well, by removing all those catchment basins and mini-dams and slow-downs to
1:06:17
the streams, not ramping rates, that’s for individual streams and events, but
1:06:21
overall runoff rates and distribution.
1:06:22
You understand.
1:06:23
But,
1:06:28
there were interesting changes that happened.
1:06:32
For example, in the Oregon Coast Range, historically, there were
1:06:38
relatively few salmon, particularly, fall chinook populations.
1:06:44
Because there was
1:06:50
a lot of slow water, and that’s not conductive to chinook.
1:06:55
That was conducive, really geared towards coho [salmon] . When many of
1:07:00
these valley areas were settled, the channels were straightened and confined.
1:07:08
The first thing you lost were the coho populations, but you saw an
1:07:11
uptick in fall chinook populations.
1:07:16
So, there are these trade-offs going on.
1:07:19
There are probably more fall chinook in the Oregon Coast Range now than
1:07:26
in Washington, and probably northern California as well,
1:07:29
than there were historically.
1:07:33
The stream shapes and the channels were changed.
1:07:36
Exactly.
1:07:36
Because of dredging or jetties or whatever.
1:07:39
Yeah, and if that goes to an extreme, then you end up even losing the fall chinook.
1:07:44
But,
1:07:47
there’s winners and losers the whole way around, all the way along.
1:07:51
You lost this, gained that, but what’s the effect?
1:08:02
You were going to give examples, good or bad in the Northwest.
1:08:04
We got to the substance, but not places.
1:08:05
Yeah,
1:08:11
I think where
1:08:14
you saw probably some of the better places tended to be either small systems that
1:08:24
the people just didn’t gravitate to, or just systems that were
1:08:29
higher in the network because
1:08:34
we hadn’t gotten there yet in our march upward.
1:08:37
And that’s where it’s happened, the federal lands, if you look at it, they
1:08:42
tend to be the more marginal areas.
1:08:45
They’ve got a lot of trees.
1:08:47
But from an aquatic perspective, they’re probably not the best
1:08:54
places in terms of fish production.
1:08:56
They tend to be steep, more confined, less favorable,
1:09:01
particularly for the salmon species.
1:09:04
But they happen to be the source for the water and the nutrients
1:09:07
that come down through the system?
1:09:07
They’re through the systems, exactly.
1:09:07
So, that’s the key point, I think, going into what we’re going to talk
1:09:12
about changing forest planning.
1:09:18
What has been more harmful affecting fisheries in the Pacific Northwest and
1:09:22
aquatic biology in general, the major networks of the dams and diversion
1:09:27
projects, or aggressive timber-cutting?
1:09:31
Undoubtedly, timber—or the dams . [Amending answer]
1:09:33
The dams, okay.
1:09:34
Oh, by far.
1:09:37
Once you put a dam in, you completely change the nature of the stream.
1:09:42
Timber harvest can change it, but if you can work with timber harvest,
1:09:45
you can keep some semblance of that stream which is going to allow for
1:09:50
other aquatic values to be expressed.
1:09:52
So,
1:09:56
if someone says to put it in the pecking order of effects, you know,
1:10:03
put urbanization at the top, and then, you have dams, and timber harvest
1:10:08
falls out down below, and agriculture; there’s a whole set of other things.
1:10:13
It’s always interesting as to how the battle’s always being
1:10:18
fought over timber harvest.
1:10:20
But there’s this multitude of other things that we’re just ignoring.
1:10:24
And I remember having a conversation with Bart Starker
1:10:28
one time about we were on a tour.
1:10:31
Who is that?
1:10:32
Bart Starker, he’s one of the owners of Starker.
1:10:33
[Starker Forests, a family forestry company based in Corvallis/Philomath
1:10:33
with holdings of 70,000+ acres of forest land in the Coast Range.]
1:10:34
Okay, Starker.
1:10:35
Starker Forests, yeah.
1:10:36
Right.
1:10:37
I remember saying, “Bart, it’s really interesting you guys are
1:10:41
getting beat up over riparian areas and what you do or don’t do, and
1:10:47
the ag [agriculture] interests just skates free in this whole thing.”
1:10:52
Basically, the runoff and what comes off into the water system?
1:10:55
Yeah, and the fact they’ve [agriculture] had no riparian requirements, they
1:11:00
don’t have to, you know, do nothing.
1:11:03
If you looked at what the timber industry is required to deal with
1:11:08
and how they manage their land, compared to the agriculture interests,
1:11:14
I mean, it’s like night and day.
1:11:19
So, what examples,
1:11:24
well,
1:11:26
the most dramatic examples, I guess they are everywhere in Oregon and Washington,
1:11:30
about dams and diversion projects and how maybe overbuilt they were?
1:11:36
Well, the Columbia is the poster child for that.
1:11:41
You just can’t change it from a running river system to a pond system.
1:11:53
And how much help are the fish ladders and other systems, to at
1:11:58
least the fish getting up to spawning grounds; ten percent, twenty percent?
1:12:05
Well, there is like a ninety percent mortality rate at any
1:12:10
one dam, of juveniles passing down, which is incredible.
1:12:16
I want to say 90 percent, but I wouldn’t bank on that.
1:12:20
I’d have to go back and look at it, but it’s very high.
1:12:23
You think if you have a ninety percent mortality at every dam, and you have
1:12:29
to go through, what, ten dams at least.
1:12:34
It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to figure out.
1:12:37
It’s amazing anything gets back, you know?
1:12:40
The question, where have all the salmon gone?
1:12:42
Well, right?
1:12:44
Right, and then you throw on top of that the fact that what
1:12:48
we’re trying to use hatchery fish to maintain this whole thing.
1:12:54
And once you put a fish into a hatchery, Mike Blouin’s work is just showing,
1:13:00
within one generation, you’ve lost tremendous reproductive capacity.
1:13:06
In other words, their biological toughness and ability to keep going, is diminished.
1:13:11
Yeah, you’re breeding it out in the first generation, and you go to successive
1:13:15
generations, you’re losing it altogether.
1:13:28
What was your first experience with forest planning?
1:13:32
You were within that situation with the Elk River supervisor, but, well,
1:13:38
you were more of a “prop,” really?
1:13:38
Yeah.
1:13:41
It was probably the Gang of Four.
1:13:44
So, that was when that happened.
1:13:45
Okay.
1:13:45
Yeah, I had never been involved with anything like that before.
1:13:49
What did you sense before you got thrown into the deep water, so to speak, during
1:13:54
the Northwest Forest Plan experience?
1:13:57
And what did you see going on in the planning world and within
1:14:01
the Forest Service, from your perspective as a young scientist?
1:14:06
Well,
1:14:08
it was just, connect with people who were on various boards and their struggle
1:14:13
in trying to do things to benefit fish.
1:14:19
We would talk to those guys all the time, and try to feed them information to help.
1:14:24
But it wasn’t until getting involved in the Gang of Four that I actually sat down
1:14:29
and started to read forest plans, and that
1:14:36
was an amazing eye-opener to do that.
1:14:39
So how would you describe forest planning policy in the Pacific Northwest
1:14:43
before the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:14:45
Because obviously when you were preparing to do that, you read
1:14:48
some previous forest plans.
1:14:50
So how would you characterize what you saw, and then, what
1:14:53
you were moving towards?
1:14:54
Well, what was clear is that timber was king and you got the maximum
1:15:03
amount of timber out with supposedly the minimal amount of damage.
1:15:08
And
1:15:14
it was hard to argue for doing anything different that didn’t maximize
1:15:20
the amount of timber coming out.
1:15:23
So, that paradigm was unquestioned by the power structure of the Forest Service?
1:15:28
Totally, yes, it was driven.
1:15:30
The paradigm [max.
1:15:31
harvest] drove the agency.
1:15:36
Did that bother you when you first got
1:15:40
into the Forest Service?
1:15:41
You know, I was somewhat naïve.
1:15:41
You don’t realize it until, it’s like, oh, wow!
1:15:47
Because what I saw of the Forest Service when I first started, was not
1:15:51
what the Forest Service was all about.
1:15:55
Research at the time, was a necessary evil as far as a lot of the people in the
1:16:05
National Forest system were concerned.
1:16:07
It was nothing but a pain.
1:16:09
They did nothing to help us.
1:16:10
They only hindered us.
1:16:13
But I was just in the environment of research, a lot of that
1:16:17
didn’t start to happen until—
1:16:20
So, you knew it was there, but it didn’t affect you too much?
1:16:21
Well, I was not even sure I knew it was there.
1:16:27
I think I knew it was there, I just didn’t realize the intensity of it.
1:16:33
Now, in your view, were these pre-Northwest Forest Plan
1:16:36
plans sustainable ecologically?
1:16:38
[Those based on 1976 Forest Mngmt.
1:16:39
Act]
1:16:40
Again, I didn’t look at it [philosophy shift] until the Gang of Four.
1:16:42
[s]
1:16:42
So, you really didn’t know at that point, okay.
1:16:44
Then, it was very clear after we got into the Gang of Four, there was no way.
1:16:51
[Earlier forest plans would not be accepted with new standards.]
1:16:52
You’re taking me up to the Gang of Four, so we’re going to go into that now.
1:17:00
You told me a story a while back about how you were approached.
1:17:03
Right.
1:17:05
You were doing your science thing, and please tell me kind of how
1:17:09
the sequence of events happened that brought you into the fold?
1:17:15
Well, it was May of 1991.
1:17:18
It was a Monday night.
1:17:20
I could go back and find the exact date.
1:17:23
But I got a call from Norm Johnson, it was about 9:00 at night.
1:17:28
And he introduces himself.
1:17:30
I had no idea who Norm Johnson was.
1:17:36
He said, “I’m doing some work for Congress,
1:17:41
would you mind coming to Portland to talk to us?” Okay, but I wondered who “us” is.
1:17:48
He said, “Could you be here tomorrow morning at nine?”
1:17:52
I said, “Sure, right, yeah,” and I’d go talk to anybody.
1:17:59
So, I remember calling Jim
1:18:03
Sedell afterward, or Sedell called me a little while later.
1:18:07
He said, “Do you know what just happened?” I said, “Some guy named Norm Johnson
1:18:12
called and he wanted some help, he wanted to talk us.” And he said, “This is big.”
1:18:18
I said, “What?” And he said, “This is big.
1:18:21
You know who these guys are?” I said, “I don’t even know who they are, much
1:18:27
less what they are.” I had heard Jack Ward Thomas’ name. Jerry Franklin, I had
1:18:33
heard about, but I didn’t really know.
1:18:35
And John Gordon, I had no idea who he was, and I had no idea
1:18:43
who Norm was.
1:18:43
But Jim said, “Pick me up at 6:30 tomorrow morning because we’ve got to
1:18:46
go to Portland.” And I said, “Okay.”
1:18:49
So, I get in the car and Jimmy says, “I’m driving.”
1:18:54
[Laughs] “We’ve got to come up with something.” I said, “What!
1:18:56
We’ve got to come up with what?” He said, “A plan.” He also said, “We’re
1:19:01
about to be interviewed by these guys.” And I said, “What?” He said, “Just tell
1:19:07
me what you”—he said, “Tell me if you were king, what we should do for fish?”
1:19:14
I said, “Okay,” started writing ideas down, and then, all the way
1:19:21
up to Portland, we talked about it.
1:19:23
And I had just stuck an issue of Fisheries, which is a magazine that
1:19:33
came out from the American Fisheries Society, and there was an article that
1:19:36
Willa Nehlsen, Jack Williams and Jim Lichatowitch, had done, called “Salmon
1:19:41
at the Crossroads,” which really surfaced the idea that many of our
1:19:48
salmon populations were in trouble.
1:19:50
I had just fortuitously stuck that in my briefcase and I wanted to read it.
1:19:56
We got there and were put in this room, and Jack Ward Thomas and
1:20:04
John Gordon and Jerry Franklin and Norm introduced themselves.
1:20:08
And
1:20:12
I was thinking, “Okay.” And there’s all these people, this was at the
1:20:14
Coliseum [Portland Memorial Coliseum] , the old Coliseum in Portland.
1:20:17
There were all these people working around tables and drawing maps and stuff.
1:20:21
So, this is the ISC activity?
1:20:23
[Interagency Scientific Committee]
1:20:24
No, this was after the ISC.
1:20:25
Okay, right, that was ‘90.
1:20:25
Yeah, and I’m thinking, “Oh, okay.”
1:20:28
You were in
1:20:33
the Coliseum?
1:20:34
Yeah, they rented the Coliseum.
1:20:36
You mean, where the Blazers [NBA team] used to play?
1:20:38
Yeah, yeah.
1:20:39
Okay,
1:20:40
Well, they had meeting rooms, big, massive meeting rooms.
1:20:43
We weren’t out on the basketball floor.
1:20:46
I was going to say, when you said it was big, okay.
1:20:50
[Laughs]
1:20:50
Well, it was.
1:20:50
It was a big room, but it wasn’t there.
1:20:52
You made it sound
1:20:56
- . And so, they said, “Well, tell us about fish?” I said, “Well, look at what
1:21:02
is happening, and there’s this really neat article that just came out, and
1:21:07
it talks about that thing, man and fish, and the fish are really in trouble.”
1:21:11
They’re like, “What?” And I said, “Yeah, look at this.” I showed it to them.
1:21:15
And they said, “Well, what would you do?” I had the little list, and read off
1:21:21
the list, about the establishment of key watersheds, something called conservation
1:21:26
areas or emphasis areas for fish, and we could make bigger riparian areas,
1:21:31
and I forget what also was on the list.
1:21:35
And they said, “Okay. You got, can you –Oh,
1:21:44
how did they say it? I just remember John Gordon saying,
1:21:48
“Okay, this game just changed.”
1:21:53
So, he was the one that kind of lit the fuse that led to the aquatic addition?
1:22:00
Well, no.
1:22:00
They all jumped, they all saw it.
1:22:02
But John,
1:22:06
I remember him sitting there and saying, “This game just changed.”
1:22:09
He said, “You know, Joe Blow,” These were his exact words.
1:22:14
He said, “Joe Blow doesn’t give a shit about owls, and they’re totally
1:22:21
confused about this whole owl/old-growth thing, and owl-job thing.” But he
1:22:27
said, “I tell you what, when we tell Joe Blow that his fish are going, and
1:22:33
the fish in the streams are going down the tubes,” he says, “It’s going to
1:22:37
change the whole nature of the debate.”
1:22:42
I’m like sitting there, and it was like, “What?” [Laughs]
1:22:47
And it is rather interesting in the context of the Endangered Species
1:22:52
Act, which was by that time almost fifteen to eighteen years old.
1:22:57
Right.
1:22:57
And they’d had major precedents with the Tellico Dam snail darter
1:23:01
[Tennessee] and the whooping crane.
1:23:02
[Nebraska]
1:23:03
Right.
1:23:03
That they didn’t realize that, well, it’s not just the owl.
1:23:07
Well no, but nobody had petitioned.
1:23:08
There were no petitions or nothing.
1:23:09
But still, it potentially could.
1:23:11
Correct?
1:23:11
Well, but I think there was a real effort to suppress that information.
1:23:18
The fisheries stuff?
1:23:19
The fish stuff.
1:23:20
Even before you came to that meeting?
1:23:21
Yes, yeah.
1:23:22
Okay, all right.
1:23:23
I think there was—I think the agencies, NOAA and Fish and Wildlife
1:23:28
Service [U.S.] , were just in denial.
1:23:34
Denial or intentionally suppressing?
1:23:37
Probably a combination of both, because it was probably suppressed
1:23:45
for political reasons, but also, it’s the agencies who didn’t want to have egg on
1:23:50
their faces as having been responsible, sort of, but now they couldn’t deny it.
1:23:56
It was like right out there front and center in
1:24:02
the Journal of the Professional Association of Fish Biologists.
1:24:08
And
1:24:11
we—I don’t think I came home for almost
1:24:19
two weeks
1:24:22
after that, I think.
1:24:24
I can’t even remember how I got clothes and stuff.
1:24:27
But they said okay.
1:24:28
You were there for two weeks in the Coliseum?
1:24:30
Yeah.
1:24:30
So, this is before the “pink tower”?
1:24:32
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:24:33
For the record, the pink tower is where the FEMAT report was produced
1:24:37
after the Clinton Summit, and which Gordie will talk about in a minute.
1:24:40
Yeah, so this was two years before, probably, close to two
1:24:45
years before the pink tower.
1:24:47
And we started calling people.
1:24:51
“You’ve got to come to Portland.” “Well, I can’t come to Portland.”
1:24:55
“Congress is telling you to come to Portland.” I mean, that was it.
1:24:59
Congress had given Norm and Jerry and that group money and—
1:25:04
And they were by that time, the Gang of Four.
1:25:08
Correct?
1:25:08
They were the Gang of Four, right.
1:25:09
Who came up with that tag, by the way?
1:25:11
The Oregonian, if I remember correctly.
1:25:16
And it had to do
1:25:22
with Chairman Mao.
1:25:23
Wasn’t it the “Gang of Eight” in China?
1:25:24
There was something about Chairman Mao, and remember, that whole upheaval
1:25:26
in China about that same time?
1:25:29
[Various versions of Gang of Four naming story exist.]
1:25:30
Well, the Cultural Revolution [s in China] was way before that.
1:25:33
Yeah, well, there was a gang of something, and I remember the joke
1:25:38
always had to do with the Chinese, but—
1:25:44
Anything.
1:25:45
We started calling the fish biologists on the various forests in the owl region, and
1:25:50
said, “You’ve got to come to Portland.” They were interested in participating,
1:25:51
but the universal response was, “Well, the forest won’t let us go.” We said,
1:25:55
“It’s not each forest or the Forest Service that’s asking you to come here.
1:26:00
It’s Congress telling you that you have to come
1:26:06
here.” With that, just about every biologist that we called came to Portland.
1:26:07
But the Forest Service traditional guys were saying, “Don’t go there.” Correct?
1:26:11
Well, it was interesting, because of the lot of the fish people, this
1:26:14
was their opportunity to finally feel like they could tell the truth.
1:26:20
Did you even sense that at this early stage in your career, or were
1:26:23
you just too naïve at that point and too new to know what political land
1:26:29
mine field you were walking into?
1:26:30
No, it wasn’t.
1:26:31
So, we were in the Coliseum for about two weeks, I think.
1:26:36
And there was all of us, Norm and Jerry, Jack, John, myself, Jim
1:26:45
and four or five other people.
1:26:47
We went over—it was Norm who arranged for us to go to the OSU Alumni Center.
1:26:54
And we worked in the basement at the Alumni Center for about the next month,
1:26:59
compiling all the information and analyzing it, and then
1:27:03
developing these alternatives for
1:27:08
Congress.
1:27:13
It was really
1:27:16
cool interacting with these guys and learning about the
1:27:19
policy aspects of this work.
1:27:19
And were you working with BLM people and other agencies?
1:27:22
Yeah, BLM, Forest Service, no fishery, or Fish and Wildlife Service, not
1:27:27
at that time, on the fish issues.
1:27:31
We were going to go back to D.C. to report to Congress, and Jack Ward Thomas came up
1:27:36
to Jim and myself and he said, “I’m going to take you guys to dinner tonight.” And
1:27:42
we went to this really nice restaurant and he says, “All right, this is it.” He said,
1:27:51
“You guys have got a decision to make.
1:27:55
If you get on that plane in the morning, your career will never be the same.”
1:27:58
“It’s going to be changed in ways you can’t even imagine.” He said, “But if you
1:28:07
leave here tonight and you don’t want to get on that plane, we all respect what
1:28:11
you did, we understand why, and we’ll represent your work the best we can.
1:28:17
So, right now, either you go.
1:28:21
If you stay, we’re all together.”
1:28:27
It’s like, what?
1:28:29
[Laughs] And I thought, it was like, holy shit!
1:28:32
This is the first time maybe somebody said that this is really big, that maybe where
1:28:36
you started to really understand that.
1:28:39
And when I finally realized the magnitude of it.
1:28:41
Because like when Jim Sedell called you on the phone that one night,
1:28:44
you still didn’t really quite get
1:28:47
it?
1:28:47
I’d never been involved in anything like this and had no idea about or
1:29:03
appreciation or the implications of doing so [high profile a project]
1:29:06
. Did you have a talk with your wife before you made that decision, or you just went?
1:29:11
Just went.
1:29:11
Did she have any idea, or you have any idea, really?
1:29:14
We had no idea.
1:29:15
Okay.
1:29:16
Except afterwards, we went back there.
1:29:21
That was a really funny night, I just laugh because that wasn’t yet
1:29:24
the end of an intense evening.”
1:29:24
You mean, the night with the dinner with Jack Ward Thomas?
1:29:26
Yeah, and Jim and
1:29:29
I forgot to get a hotel room.
1:29:34
We worked until like 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, all of us, getting everything
1:29:38
ready, getting it all packaged up.
1:29:40
And we had like a 6:00 or 7:00 flight out
1:29:44
of Portland.
1:29:46
So Norm said, “Well, why don’t you
1:29:51
just come back.” He had a room somewhere and he said, “Just come
1:29:52
back to sleep in my room.” And
1:29:58
so,
1:30:00
Jim and I went back to Norm’s room.
1:30:02
There was barely enough room between the wall and the bed to sleep, and
1:30:08
Norm had all the blankets and we were sleeping on the floor with no blankets.
1:30:11
I said, “All right, screw this,” and I took the blankets off of Norm’s
1:30:15
bed, left him with the sheet, and gave Jim a blanket and myself a
1:30:19
blanket, and we slept on the floor.
1:30:21
Norm laughs about that still.
1:30:23
He said, “I was cold all night,” and I said, “Well, the floor
1:30:27
wasn’t very comfortable, either.”
1:30:29
Do I have permission to ask him during his interview about that?
1:30:31
Oh, yeah, and we laugh about it all the time.
1:30:37
The next day, we got on the plane, got back to D.C. and went to Congress.
1:30:44
We went to the area where the congressional offices were, and
1:30:52
we were put into this big room.
1:30:55
There were these three guys who came to help us, various [congressional] staffers.
1:31:02
One was Jim Lyons, one was, let’s see, what’s the guy who
1:31:10
had—Tom Tuchman, and who is he?
1:31:14
One of the primary authors on that final report, the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:31:17
Right.
1:31:20
They were all working for various congressional leaders,
1:31:23
and Will Stelle, head of NOAA.
1:31:28
They were all aides to various congressmen who had the panel
1:31:35
that sanctioned the Gang of Four.
1:31:39
They went out and got us pizza and other stuff while we were working, and
1:31:42
we worked until really late that night.
1:31:45
The next morning we were going to testify before Congress.
1:31:48
Now,
1:31:50
Jim and I weren’t going to testify because we were agency people.
1:31:53
They didn’t want us
1:31:56
front-and-center.
1:31:58
And
1:32:01
so, John Gordon, Norm [Johnson] , Jerry [Franklin] and Jack [Ward
1:32:05
Thomas] were going to testify.
1:32:07
But beforehand, we had a meeting with the Northwest delegation in
1:32:12
this closed room, just us and the delegation, so the delegation knew what
1:32:18
was going to be said at this hearing.
1:32:23
They went through the owl and the old growth issues, and
1:32:25
everybody was like, “Oh, okay.”
1:32:33
Then John Gordon said, “And we have fish.”
1:32:40
The look on people’s face was like, what?
1:32:46
You have fish?
1:32:49
John asked
1:32:51
me to give a quick summary, and I told them 214 populations that are
1:32:55
troubled, and we’ve lost blah, blah,
1:33:01
blah.
1:33:02
Bob Smith, who was a congressman from eastern Oregon, his head
1:33:07
literally bounced off the table.
1:33:09
It was like, what?
1:33:11
We’ve got fish?
1:33:17
They were just totally shocked.
1:33:19
How were you able to make the causation between certain activities, whether it be
1:33:24
timber or water diversion, dam projects?
1:33:27
How were you able to tie that into the same process?
1:33:31
Well, this report, the “Salmon at the Crossroads,” had identified habitat
1:33:38
degradation as the number one cause for decline, and that degradation came
1:33:42
from dams, that degradation came from
1:33:45
-- The whole, everything.
1:33:45
Everything.
1:33:46
But it was very clear, there was lots of evidence about the issues with dams.
1:33:52
So, we did that behind closed doors.
1:33:56
There was just an absolute silence.
1:33:59
There was like, you could just see just, oh, my God, you know
1:34:05
[concerning people’s reactions] . Then we did the public hearing.
1:34:08
And again, Jim and I didn’t testify.
1:34:13
Was the public hearing also in Washington?
1:34:14
Yeah.
1:34:14
It was later that day.
1:34:14
So, it’s the same?
1:34:16
It was
1:34:19
before a committee.
1:34:20
The same trip, okay.
1:34:20
Before the congressional committee that sanctioned it.
1:34:23
And the Chief of the Forest Service, Dale Robertson, he came to it and
1:34:31
they went through the whole thing about the owl and old growth.
1:34:35
Then John Gordon began talking about fish.
1:34:41
And I think Jim and I would have been hung right there, if they could have hung us.
1:34:47
And finally, Dale Robertson gets up and storms out, and the full
1:34:56
cadre of people with him just get up and leave the hearing en masse.
1:35:01
And
1:35:07
I didn’t think much of it, you know?
1:35:10
We get back to the hotel, we’re going to do to dinner, and we’re sitting
1:35:14
in the lobby and I see Norm get up and go in one direction, I see
1:35:19
Jim go in another direction, I see Jerry go in another direction, and
1:35:23
John Gordon go in another direction.
1:35:26
All of a sudden, it’s just Jack and me, and he said, “All right, you’d
1:35:30
better hang on because here they come.” All of these sort of high
1:35:35
deputy “muckety-mucks” in the Forest Service came and invited us to dinner.
1:35:45
So, I’m watching this, and pretty soon they separate me from Jack, and they
1:35:51
start telling me what a bad employee I am, like I never should say this stuff,
1:35:58
and I need to retract what I was saying.
1:36:00
You didn’t say anything, they said it for you.
1:36:03
They said it for us, yeah.
1:36:04
Yeah.
1:36:04
Where did you get this information?
1:36:07
And so on and so forth.
1:36:09
We went to dinner, and it was just like, wow, this is really—
1:36:15
You got attacked pretty hard-core, huh?
1:36:17
Yeah.
1:36:18
But it was still like, what?
1:36:20
I’m just being totally naïve.
1:36:22
I didn’t
1:36:32
know.
1:36:33
I can’t remember the guy’s name.
1:36:34
He says, “You can’t say this stuff.” And I said, “Look, I’m not saying anything
1:36:37
that isn’t true.” He said, “None of that’s true.” And I said, “It says it
1:36:42
right in the forest plans.” I said,
1:36:49
“Have
1:36:51
you read the forest plans?” “Oh, I’ve read every one of them.” What I had done,
1:36:57
is I had xeroxed all the appropriate pages out of the forest plans, and then
1:37:03
highlighted the same for every forest in the Northwest Forest Plan area.
1:37:10
I said, “Here, look at this.” He said, “Where’d you get that?” I
1:37:15
said, “I read the forest plans.”
1:37:20
He said, “We never said anything negative in the forest plans.”
1:37:25
I said,
1:37:27
“The Siuslaw says you’re going to lose twenty percent of your habitat.
1:37:30
The Umpqua says you’re going to lose fifteen percent of it.
1:37:31
The GP [Gifford Pinchot National Forest] is dependent on making paper and fish.
1:37:36
You’re going to cut the shit out of a place, but you’re going to restore it
1:37:41
so you that you don’t lose this.” I said, “It sounds to me like fish are in
1:37:46
trouble.” He said, “Let me have that.” I said, “Here it is.” I gave it to him.
1:37:52
Jack and I went back and the next day, and then we had to
1:37:57
visit every
1:38:01
person in the Northwest delegation, the congressional delegation;
1:38:04
we went to their offices.
1:38:08
The phones started ringing and somebody would come in while we were talking to
1:38:11
the congressman or congresswoman, and say, “Gordon, you know, the Forest Service
1:38:17
wants to talk to you.” So, I’d go out and there’d be somebody saying, “Now, what
1:38:22
forest plan was this?” And, “Which one are you talking about?” Then I said, “Look
1:38:26
at the top of the page, it’ll say Umpqua, it’ll say Siuslaw.” “Okay.” I’d go to
1:38:31
the next office, “And where did you find that?” I said, “It’s right in the forest
1:38:35
plan.” It went on for the whole day.
1:38:44
Finally, they said, well, we never said this.
1:38:48
And I said, “I’m not making this up.
1:38:52
It’s right there in black and white.” Then
1:38:59
they sanctioned an assessment of the work Jim
1:39:07
and I did, the Forest Service.
1:39:12
They appointed a guy who
1:39:17
was at Utah State.
1:39:19
He worked for the Forest Service, but was at Utah State in terms of training, and
1:39:26
basically put on short courses and stuff with continuing education.
1:39:29
Not McMahon
1:39:30
? No, this was Jeff Kirschner.
1:39:33
Okay.
1:39:34
He was somebody else anyway.
1:39:36
Jeff
1:39:40
did this report.
1:39:42
And we did get
1:39:45
a call from Jim Lyons, and I remember, he said, “They’re about to
1:39:48
fire your boy.” It’s like, our boy?
1:39:52
“They’re about to fire Kirschner, because he agreed with what you guys
1:40:01
said.” We said, your job, Jim Lyons, is to save Jeff Kirschner’s
1:40:04
job. You’ve got to get to
1:40:10
Harold Volkmer [D-Mo.] , the guy in charge of the committee on Natural Resources and
1:40:19
Merchant Marine, or something like that.
1:40:21
You’ve got to tell them what they’re going to do.
1:40:25
And it ended up that he went and there was no way they were going to fire Kirschner.
1:40:30
Well,
1:40:33
what about you guys?
1:40:36
The hearings are over now.
1:40:37
Your little congressional office meetings are over.
1:40:41
Then, you come back?
1:40:42
Well, no, it was really just strange.
1:40:44
When I really knew how serious it was, was afterwards.
1:40:50
First of all, Jack Ward Thomas was sent a message from the Chief [Forest Service]
1:40:56
that he was no longer welcome in the Forest Service building, and neither
1:41:00
were Gordie Reeves and Jim Sedell.
1:41:02
But he was Fish and Wildlife at that time?
1:41:04
No, he was Forest Service.
1:41:05
Oh, he was?
1:41:05
Yeah.
1:41:06
Oh, okay.
1:41:08
Jack had to go to the Forest Service building, and he said, “We’re
1:41:10
going to go to that building. I’ve got to do something, I’ve
1:41:13
got to talk to some people in
1:41:17
there.” “But Jack, they just said.” “Don’t worry about what they said.”
1:41:20
We were going down these alleys and somebody lets us in the back door. And
1:41:25
I mean, we’re meeting in the basement.
1:41:26
It sounds like a spy movie.
1:41:28
Oh, you know, it was that sort of thing.
1:41:32
And Norm, well, I’ll let Norm tell
1:41:36
you about what happened to him.
1:41:38
You mean within the College of Forestry?
1:41:39
[OSU]
1:41:39
Yeah, yeah.
1:41:41
You know, he was denied tenure.
1:41:43
I’ll talk to him about that later.
1:41:45
Yeah, and we’re sitting in a cab.
1:41:47
Norm’s writing his letter of resignation to OSU.
1:41:53
And Jim and Jerry are saying, “Don’t do this!” I’m just like watching this whole
1:41:57
thing, thinking, like holy cow, this
1:42:00
is amazing.
1:42:01
Did you by this time realize that you had shaken the hornet’s nest?
1:42:05
Whooh!
1:42:06
Big-time, big-time.
1:42:08
Were you worried for your career?
1:42:10
No, not really.
1:42:11
No?
1:42:11
I don’t know why, but it was just like, what?
1:42:16
[Laughs] You know, I think part of it may be naïvete.
1:42:19
I just didn’t feel like I did anything wrong.
1:42:25
You just did science.
1:42:26
I just did science.
1:42:28
As John Gordon said, what we did within the Gang of Four, was science assessment.
1:42:32
We didn’t produce new science, we assessed the science.
1:42:36
And he was very clear.
1:42:36
I thought that was a very elegant way to describe it.
1:42:39
Well, you didn’t create a new wheel, you just plugged facts
1:42:44
into the discussion at hand.
1:42:46
Correct?
1:42:47
Yeah, yeah.
1:42:47
Why do you think the Forest Service was in such denial, or
1:42:51
did they want to be in denial?
1:42:53
I think politically, they couldn’t be anything but.
1:42:56
Because they were basically so tied in with the timber industry?
1:43:00
Yeah, and you know, it was a Republican administration
1:43:02
telling him what they had to do.
1:43:06
And Congress was telling them
1:43:12
what they had to do.
1:43:12
You come back from this.
1:43:14
Tell me about between then and when things really got busy in terms of
1:43:21
the Clinton Summit and FEMAT.
1:43:23
I know there were some planning attempts starting to be implemented or
1:43:27
finished under the Bush administration.
1:43:30
But if I recall, they just kind of were left there.
1:43:32
[Not enacted or completed due to legal challenges.]
1:43:33
They were left there, exactly.
1:43:34
Then,
1:43:38
I think it was Judge Dwyer
1:43:43
who said we had to work for him.
1:43:45
[Fulfill requirements of Endangered Species Act.]
1:43:46
The second injunction, correct?
1:43:47
The second injunction.
1:43:48
Right.
1:43:48
And that was just Forest Service scientists.
1:43:53
So, it was Jack, Jim
1:44:01
Sedell, myself, Bruce Marcot, Marty Raphael,
1:44:06
and other people.
1:44:07
Basically, we had to do the same thing for Judge Dwyer that we had just done
1:44:13
for Congress, in terms of offering him options for resolving the problem.
1:44:28
The interesting part about the fish, there were no ESA listed
1:44:32
species or ESU’s [evolutionarily significant units] , at the time.
1:44:36
So,
1:44:39
there was no legal mandate to deal with fish, although
1:44:42
people knew this was coming.
1:44:46
We end
1:44:48
up working on the SAT, and
1:44:58
Jim and I were able to do most of the work there.
1:45:00
The SAT, for the record, what was that?
1:45:03
The Scientific Assessment Team.
1:45:04
Okay, that was after the ISC, after the Congress, but before FEMAT?
1:45:08
After the Gang of Four, before FEMAT.
1:45:10
Okay, right.
1:45:12
So, we got that done, and then, Clinton came.
1:45:15
You know, Clinton during the campaign, had said that if elected, he would
1:45:21
help resolve this whole issue and bring some semblance of sanity to it.
1:45:29
So that happened, Clinton gets elected in
1:45:36
November.
1:45:37
In March [actually April] , he’s out here having a summit.
1:45:40
And while all that’s going on, Jack’s organizing the FEMAT effort.
1:45:49
So, we knew about FEMAT before it was announced.
1:45:52
Did you go to the summit?
1:45:53
No.
1:45:54
Jim Sedell, didn’t he attend?
1:45:55
Yeah, Jim did.
1:45:57
What did Jim say about that?
1:45:59
It must have been quite an experience.
1:46:02
It was really funny.
1:46:03
You know, I was glad Jimmy did it.
1:46:05
I didn’t want to.
1:46:06
I would have been too nervous to do it.
1:46:08
Well, you already got shaken up by your Washington trip and experience.
1:46:12
But Jimmy was definitely a much more confident person
1:46:14
around political dynamics.
1:46:14
I’m a scientist in my early
1:46:18
career.
1:46:18
I did not have the standing that Jim did.
1:46:21
Oh, okay.
1:46:22
I understand why he did it, but he was really nervous.
1:46:26
And I remember, I helped him with what he was going to say.
1:46:30
I
1:46:33
get a call at, it must have been 1:30-2:00 in the morning, and he said, “Gordon,
1:46:38
I can’t do this. I’m really nervous, I don’t know what I’m doing.” I said,
1:46:43
“All right, I’ll be right there.” I got up and I drove to Portland. I remember
1:46:47
I met him at this Kinko’s somewhere downtown at 3:00-3:30 in the morning, and
1:46:54
we worked on what he was going to say.
1:46:58
For that morning, right?
1:46:59
For that morning, yeah.
1:47:00
He wasn’t speaking too soon.
1:47:07
I left there about 8:00-8:30 and came home, got home about 10:30.
1:47:13
And we all went down to Squirrel’s because it [Clinton Summit]
1:47:15
was on the TV at Squirrel’s.
1:47:17
It was broadcast.
1:47:18
I remember it was about noon when Jimmy got his chance, and
1:47:22
then we were eating, having a burger, and Jimmy did a great job.
1:47:31
What was his spiel?
1:47:33
On the aquatic biology?
1:47:34
Yeah.
1:47:37
What do you think the Summit did for the whole dynamic of what became
1:47:43
the Northwest Forest Plan, and in general, the culture and atmosphere
1:47:48
surrounding old growth and natural resource management in the Northwest?
1:47:50
Well, I think it gave us legitimacy, made it more legit, and gave
1:47:56
it some sense of importance.
1:47:58
Now, here’s the President saying that we’re going to get this resolved, and
1:48:03
I want you scientists to help me do
1:48:10
it.
1:48:10
You guys weren’t ready for that, were you?
1:48:12
At that point, we were, at least I felt much better prepared for it,
1:48:17
than I was with the Gang of Four.
1:48:20
At
1:48:23
that point, you’re starting to think, okay, fool me once,
1:48:29
fine, but you’re not going to get me twice, that type of thing.
1:48:37
Was it the Gang of Four that was charged with leading the FEMAT
1:48:43
report, or tell me how that went?
1:48:45
Well, because it was a federal committee, you’re under FACA rules [Federal Advisory
1:48:50
Committee Act-governs establishment and operations of advisory committees]
1:48:50
. Technically, Jack was in charge.
1:48:53
Norm and Jerry were brought in as advisors , as was John Gordon.
1:48:57
[Norm, Jerry, John were academics, not federal employees, which some
1:48:58
viewed as a violation of FACA processes.] So, there were a lot more
1:49:00
federal scientists involved in it,
1:49:04
and Jim and I were the co-leads for the aquatic component.
1:49:12
How did the whole ninety days go?
1:49:14
It’s supposed to be sixty days, originally, then it
1:49:17
was extended to ninety.
1:49:18
Correct, ninety.
1:49:18
And you were in one floor of the U.S. Bank building in downtown
1:49:23
Portland, called the “pink tower”?
1:49:25
[Term given by FEMAT participants]
1:49:25
Right.
1:49:25
Is it really pink?
1:49:26
Yep.
1:49:27
Okay.
1:49:28
Tell me about how that came about?
1:49:30
Well, Jack rented it.
1:49:32
He was looking for a space where we could all work together.
1:49:37
It was a massive room with a couple small meeting rooms off of it, and
1:49:43
the idea was to try to facilitate more interaction among the various groups.
1:49:50
The aquatic group was in one part, the owl guys were here,
1:49:53
the vegetation people there.
1:49:58
As we called them, the “low-lifes,” which were the “survey and manage”
1:50:02
people, were in another section [Focused on non-charismatic species,
1:50:06
such as lichens and fungi] . Murrelet people were somewhere else.
1:50:09
And we all
1:50:16
met a lot together,
1:50:19
the various teams, so everybody could see; what the old growth people
1:50:24
are thinking about this, and the owl people are thinking about that.
1:50:27
And we’re thinking, the aquatic people, are thinking something else.
1:50:31
And a lot of really interesting discussions, so it was really—
1:50:35
That kind of thing doesn’t happen very often?
1:50:37
No, no, no.
1:50:38
It was an once-in-a-lifetime experience.
1:50:40
And the thing is, we were drawing on mylar maps with
1:50:48
magic markers.
1:50:50
Somebody then would have to take them and digitize them, and we’d
1:50:54
have to wait for a few days to get an answer back, to see if it is five
1:50:57
acres or is it five hundred acres.
1:51:00
This is a time when connectedness was not what it is now.
1:51:04
You obviously had some computers there, but primitive ones by today’s standards.
1:51:08
Yep.
1:51:09
How did you get your data and information together so everybody went
1:51:12
up there and you were ready to go?
1:51:13
How did that all happen?
1:51:14
Everybody just grabbed everything they had, threw it in a car, and went up there?
1:51:18
Yeah.
1:51:19
That was basically it.
1:51:21
And then we got there and the aquatic area was roped off, and then,
1:51:29
Jim and I assigned areas; let’s get the hydrologist sites on this side,
1:51:33
we’ll get the biotechs over here.
1:51:37
We got together and said, let’s outline the framework that
1:51:41
we’re going to work towards.
1:51:45
Wow.
1:51:45
Yeah.
1:51:47
Some especially interesting anecdotes that you could share about that
1:51:51
experience that you remember?
1:51:53
No, it was just,
1:51:58
going sixteen to eighteen hours a day, hard.
1:52:03
Seven days a week?
1:52:04
Seven days a week.
1:52:05
How did you survive that?
1:52:07
That’s some pretty serious hours.
1:52:09
Those were serious hours, yeah.
1:52:11
I
1:52:14
don’t know.
1:52:14
Much worse than a dissertation?
1:52:16
Yeah.
1:52:19
I remember the most challenging part was where we developed, I
1:52:25
think we developed eight options, and thought we were all done.
1:52:30
We got them all tied up, evaluated and packaged up, and gave them to Jack.
1:52:39
He then went to D.C., and we were still working.
1:52:44
Are you talking about what they called the alternatives or options?
1:52:46
Yeah, the alternatives.
1:52:46
It was like,
1:52:49
here’s what we do for fish, here’s what we do for owls, here’s what it’s
1:52:52
going to be for timber production, so on and so forth; these assessments.
1:52:56
He [Jack] went back, made a presentation to the White House, came back,
1:52:59
and said, “None of these work.”
1:53:02
So, this was after the sixty days, correct?
1:53:04
Yeah.
1:53:05
This was probably about day seventy, because we were still behind.
1:53:09
Okay.
1:53:09
He came back and said, “These aren’t going to work.”
1:53:13
What was the reason given to him?
1:53:14
They just couldn’t find enough protection and enough timber.
1:53:20
I remember it was a Friday afternoon, and he said, “Okay, nobody’s going home.
1:53:23
You’ve got until Monday morning to come up with two new alternatives.” It
1:53:30
was Friday afternoon.
1:53:31
We cleared the room, everybody brought their maps out, and we started trading.
1:53:37
Okay, I got a key watershed that’s got this old growth in it, but if
1:53:40
I can move my key watershed over here, you can get more old growth,
1:53:43
and that puts this into the Matrix, which helped with the timber base.
1:53:48
And if you can move this LSOG [Late Successional-Old Growth]
1:53:51
over to this key watershed, I can do this and you can do that.
1:53:55
We sat there and literally went over every inch of ground in the Northwest
1:54:00
Forest Plan area, trying to figure out how to reconfigure this to gain
1:54:05
some acreage and still maintain a sufficient level of protection.
1:54:13
Working till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning on Friday, and on Saturday, being back
1:54:17
in there at 8:00 am and going at it again until 8:00 or 9:00 at night,
1:54:21
coming back in on Sunday morning at 8:00 in the morning and going at it till
1:54:28
probably 2:00 in the morning on Monday.
1:54:29
Then, when Jack walked in, we had—
1:54:31
Was that
1:54:33
what became Alternative 9?
1:54:35
Uh-huh.
1:54:38
When looking at the categories, and I don’t want to use the word matrix,
1:54:41
because matrix is a title for one of the types of zoning [in NWFP] , but if you
1:54:46
were going to look at the categorization scheme, and what it was meant to do,
1:54:52
what did you think about how they came up with the LS Old Growth Reserves, the
1:54:59
Riparian Reserves, the buffer zones, the Matrix, and the AMA’s [Adaptive
1:55:03
Management Areas] . Were there any others?
1:55:04
Yeah, those were the biggies.
1:55:06
Yeah.
1:55:07
Again, we all had to
1:55:12
talk to each other because we needed to know what each other was doing.
1:55:16
We just spent a bunch of time together,
1:55:20
and I’d say, I can put a key watershed over here in this LSOG,
1:55:28
and move this one.
1:55:30
If we move this key watershed, then it might give you, it might put a little
1:55:34
bit more land back in the Matrix.
1:55:37
And I’m not exaggerating, we went over everything, we’d sort of get done with the
1:55:44
whole area, and then we’d put a map up and look at it and say, does that look right?
1:55:48
Does the distribution look right?
1:55:49
Are there gaps somewhere?
1:55:51
And we’d take the map down and start all over again.
1:55:54
Because you’re thinking about not only riparian, but owl
1:55:57
habitat and connectiveness, and there’s BLM, and there’s Forest
1:56:02
Service, and there’s private, and there’s all this [land ownership]
1:56:04
. Yeah, and we didn’t have the luxury of the sophisticated tools you have
1:56:09
today for that type of analysis.
1:56:11
We were literally drawing on Mylar, hanging it on the wall and stepping
1:56:15
back, and asking, what do you see?
1:56:17
Well, I see a gap over here.
1:56:18
So, it was like the domino thing, if you move this one, then
1:56:22
everything else sort of falls apart.
1:56:24
Even with that.
1:56:28
We spent an entire weekend
1:56:33
drawing the map, redrawing the map, reconfiguring the map, and
1:56:37
just going back-and-forth, talking
1:56:42
to Eric Forsman about the owls, and Jack about the owls, and Marty
1:56:47
would talk about murrelets, and then we’d have this fish thing.
1:56:51
We’d have to call somebody, wait a minute, and tried to do something on the Umpqua
1:56:55
[National Forest] . I would call Jeff Dose, the Umpqua biologist, and say, “Hey,
1:57:00
Jeff, what about if we were to put this watershed in instead of that watershed?”
1:57:04
You were horse trading?
1:57:06
It was a total horse trade.
1:57:08
It was a total horse trade.
1:57:12
Now, what do you think about the product that came out in
1:57:15
the form of Alternative 9?
1:57:16
At the time, how did you feel about its scientific integrity?
1:57:24
I think it was strong.
1:57:26
We brought a bunch of people in to rate the options, and these were people from
1:57:33
industry [timber] , there were academics, I’m trying to remember if there were
1:57:41
regulatory people.
1:57:45
I think there were maybe some people from different agencies, NOAA for fisheries,
1:57:50
in anticipation of the listings.
1:57:54
We had to get up and explain to them each option, show them the map of the whole
1:57:59
region, and explain why we did things.
1:58:01
I did all of that.
1:58:05
That was like a two or three-day process.
1:58:09
Then when we developed the new options, we brought them back
1:58:11
in and did it all over again.
1:58:15
So, I knew the gory details of everything, because I wanted to make
1:58:18
sure if somebody had a question,
1:58:21
I could answer it.
1:58:26
You had been learning since the first, the start of this whole thing, that you do not
1:58:32
want to be caught with your pants down.
1:58:33
Totally, totally.
1:58:35
Because somebody very important could say something that you’d better at least be
1:58:38
able to give an intelligent answer for.
1:58:40
And be able to explain stuff.
1:58:42
So,
1:58:45
I was responsible for
1:58:51
directing the development of these things and the assessments, but then
1:58:54
having to go make the appearances, you know, do all the presentations on them.
1:59:01
So, what happened?
1:59:04
Alternative 9 is presented.
1:59:07
Jack Ward Thomas, did he take it back to the White House?
1:59:10
Uh-huh [affirmative].
1:59:12
And?
1:59:12
That one got a thumbs-up.
1:59:13
Okay.
1:59:14
And then we had to wrap everything up.
1:59:17
What happened after that?
1:59:20
Well, it was a mad scramble to finish.
1:59:22
Which meant what?
1:59:23
Well, getting the report done, making sure all the assessments were completed.
1:59:30
That’s the FEMAT report, the big monster, which is 500 or 600 pages?
1:59:35
Yeah.
1:59:36
So, it was a scramble to get that done and handed off to the people who were going
1:59:43
to do the environmental impact statement.
1:59:44
[Compliance issues under NEPA.]
1:59:45
And that would eventually lead to the Record of Decision,
1:59:48
the guidelines and all that.
1:59:49
Right?
1:59:50
Yeah, yeah.
1:59:51
So, you were out of the “pink tower,” you’re back in your regular
1:59:54
office environments, doing this collectively, from different locations?
1:59:58
Correct?
1:59:59
Uh-huh [affirmative].
1:59:59
Okay.
2:00:00
Except, I came back.
2:00:03
I remember I came home after the last day in the pink tower.
2:00:10
I’d barely got home.
2:00:11
I hadn’t slept for, I think, three days.
2:00:15
We were up for three straight days.
2:00:19
I can’t believe I stayed up.
2:00:20
I don’t drink coffee or caffeine, and I just stayed up.
2:00:24
You must have been wasted?
2:00:25
Oh, I was.
2:00:26
I think I took one nap.
2:00:28
I went in under Jack Ward Thomas’ desk at about 4:00 in the morning.
2:00:34
At 6:00, I felt somebody tapping me, and it’s Jack.
2:00:45
He said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I’ve been up for sixty hours.”
2:00:51
He said, “What?” I said, “I’ve been up for sixty hours.” He said, “Get
2:00:52
out of here.” I said, “I can’t go yet.” He said, “You’ve got to get
2:00:55
out of here.” So, we finished up.
2:00:57
I came home.
2:00:57
I don’t even know how I drove home, how I ended up there.
2:01:02
I had all this stuff.
2:01:05
I dropped my wallet when I was coming in the house, and someone picked it up.
2:01:09
Was it on the street?
2:01:09
Yeah, right out
2:01:12
front here.
2:01:13
I had no idea who it was.
2:01:14
And they ended up using my credit card.
2:01:16
What?
2:01:17
Yeah.
2:01:17
So, the price of all this is that you basically got credit card-frauded?
2:01:22
Yeah.
2:01:24
Fortunately, when
2:01:27
they saw the signature and stuff, it was pretty clear.
2:01:31
But I just remember just coming home, just collapsing and sleeping.
2:01:35
Wow.
2:01:37
And then I was useless.
2:01:39
I mean, it’d been like three years of constant activities [connected
2:01:43
to NWFP and planning in general]
2:01:44
. So, this was just insane, from ’91 until ‘94?
2:01:48
Right?
2:01:48
Yeah.
2:01:55
Jim and I both went in to Fred Evere st and said, “Look, we need a break.
2:01:58
We’ve got to get out of here.” Fred said, “Okay, figure out where you want
2:02:02
to go for six months and I’ll make it happen.” We went to New Zealand.
2:02:12
South Island, North Island, or both?
2:02:13
Went to the North Island.
2:02:15
There was a student who worked with Jim Hall,
2:02:18
who had gotten a teaching position at
2:02:24
Waikato University in Hamilton.
2:02:26
I
2:02:27
got a hold of Brendan [Hicks] and said, “Hey, can you get me an office?”
2:02:30
He said, “Yeah, why?” I said, “Well, I think I can get a sabbatical for six
2:02:33
months to come to New Zealand.”
2:02:39
We finished [NWFP-related work] at
2:02:40
the end of July, and the first of November, I was in New Zealand.
2:02:44
And this was for what purpose other than R&R?
2:02:50
It ended up that I had some of the most productive research
2:02:56
and writing periods of my life.
2:02:58
So, it was research, but it was R&R?
2:03:00
Definitely.
2:03:02
We had to get out of there.
2:03:04
And Meg took a leave of absence.
2:03:06
She went down with you?
2:03:07
Oh, yeah.
2:03:08
She took a leave of absence from her job.
2:03:10
We took the kids out of school.
2:03:12
We went to New Zealand for six months.
2:03:14
I came home, we came home.
2:03:16
We went in November, we came home at the end of April.
2:03:24
Then in June, Jim went to France for six months.
2:03:28
So, we traded off doing it, but it was exhausting.
2:03:36
How do you feel that in the long run this affected your career
2:03:40
trajectory at the Forest Service?
2:03:43
Didn’t you tell me before that somebody kind of had your back, one of the
2:03:47
politicians, when you were early-on in this process, and Robertson [Dale] and
2:03:52
some Forest Service people got all po-ed?
2:03:56
Oh, yeah.
2:03:57
It was Jim Lyons and folks in Congress who did it.
2:04:00
Okay.
2:04:01
Yeah, yeah.
2:04:05
You come back and this is now the law of the land.
2:04:08
How do you feel that this [Northwest Forest Plan process] affected
2:04:10
your Forest Service career?
2:04:12
Well, we never really
2:04:21
left it, as it’s been part of my career ever since.
2:04:25
You’ve been involved in the monitoring and review process since?
2:04:28
Right?
2:04:28
Yeah, I tried to direct myself out of it, though there was supposed to be a
2:04:33
monitoring program that’s part of this.
2:04:37
There were four attempts, I think, at developing a monitoring program,
2:04:42
and none of them worked due to different squabbles in the agency.
2:04:46
Someone finally came to me and said, “Look, you need to be in charge of
2:04:50
this to make this happen.” And I did.
2:04:53
Of the monitoring program?
2:04:54
[Aquatic portion]
2:04:54
The monitoring program.
2:04:57
I thought it was pretty innovative in the way we did things.
2:05:01
But then, you’re constantly thinking because you knew what
2:05:04
the individual intent of this was, and how we came up with things.
2:05:09
So, it has always been, if you’ve got a question, I’m the person they came to.
2:05:14
Let’s talk about the plan itself now.
2:05:20
How pleased were you with the final product regarding aquatics and the
2:05:24
buffer zones that are in the reserves?
2:05:26
Talk a little bit about that.
2:05:28
I thought we had just hit it out of the park, and that we had really done well.
2:05:32
It was really innovative, very creative, and really
2:05:39
a major advancement in terms of thinking about aquatic ecosystems.
2:05:44
How would you compare it to what was the thinking before, or at least the
2:05:47
planning and implementation before?
2:05:50
Well, prior to the Northwest Forest Plan, if you looked at what was in the forest
2:05:56
plans themselves, there was a riparian
2:06:04
management area with maybe one hundred feet on some of the better plans, like
2:06:08
the Willamette, and as small as fifty feet or less in many of the forests.
2:06:14
And that was only along the fish-bearing streams.
2:06:17
So,
2:06:20
we did two things.
2:06:21
One, we said, “Look, what you have to do is think about the outer boundary
2:06:25
of the aquatic ecosystem.” Start there and work your way in. Don’t set some
2:06:30
arbitrary distance because we wanted to focus on the ecological processes that
2:06:36
were really important to maintain the long-term productivity of these systems.
2:06:40
So, that was one thing.
2:06:42
Secondly, we said, “You’ve got to think about non-fish-bearing streams.”
2:06:48
We were just getting an inkling about the importance of these in terms
2:06:52
of a number of different things.
2:06:56
So, we really pushed the envelope in terms of what people thought
2:06:59
an aquatic ecosystem was.
2:07:03
And
2:07:08
I can remember thinking that I was really proud of myself.
2:07:11
And I was also proud of everybody who worked on this, that what we did in
2:07:15
ninety days was quite spectacular.
2:07:20
But then I went to New Zealand and I started asking myself,
2:07:25
“What did we really do?”
2:07:30
Or how is this going to be interpreted, regarding what we did?
2:07:36
I came away much less convinced that we had done a really stellar job.
2:07:43
And why was that?
2:07:44
Do you think it was more buyer’s remorse or
2:07:51
-- ? The idea was, if we draw a line on the map, it means something ecologically.
2:07:58
In other words, you kind of realized that maybe some of these things,
2:08:01
although they really sounded and looked good, might have been arbitrary?
2:08:04
Yeah.
2:08:07
Then
2:08:09
I started thinking about it and communicated with Jim while I was
2:08:14
in New Zealand, and thinking about what was it that we really did, as
2:08:20
opposed to what we intended to be done.
2:08:22
And ended up then, really spending a lot of time reading.
2:08:28
I just went to the library all the time and just read.
2:08:33
It was such an amazing thing.
2:08:35
In New Zealand?
2:08:36
In New Zealand.
2:08:36
Also, you were in a new context ecologically?
2:08:39
Yeah, oh, yeah.
2:08:40
And so, you were looking at things through that lens also.
2:08:43
Yeah, but that was just sort of a minor thing.
2:08:49
The real experience was having the luxury to step back and critically
2:08:54
examine yourself and what you were thinking, and then challenging myself
2:09:00
and asking--is that really true?
2:09:01
What came out of that whole process?
2:09:03
We wrote a paper, Jim, myself and a couple other people involved with FEMAT, that
2:09:12
we really described how we thought things should work, and it was published in 1995.
2:09:18
That paper still gets a lot of play today.
2:09:20
What was it called?
2:09:23
“A Dynamic Perspective on Aquatic Ecosystems,” something like
2:09:27
that. I can’t remember the name.
2:09:29
We also gave a presentation at the American Fisheries Society Symposium
2:09:35
on Salmon, and the ESA [Ecological Society of America] in Monterey [Cal.]
2:09:43
. That would be, if I could look at a pinnacle in terms of scientific fun
2:09:48
and accomplishment, that would be it.
2:09:50
In other words, after you had climbed the mountain, you realized
2:09:54
you needed to reassess the mountain?
2:09:55
That’s right.
2:09:56
That’s right, yeah.
2:09:57
So, it was a moment of humility, but also enlightenment?
2:10:00
Exactly.
2:10:01
And there was the thought—“Wait a minute, that’s not
2:10:09
how are you going to interpret what was in option 9, to put
2:10:13
it into play for management.”
2:10:18
We didn’t do a good job, I don’t think, of providing that [for
2:10:22
managers in NW Forest Plan area] . This was an attempt to do that.
2:10:29
[Break in Audio]
2:10:29
Okay, we’re picking things back up where Gordie had already talked about
2:10:33
New Zealand, and was reassessing the science and what he had done with
2:10:38
the aquatic portion of the FEMAT report and the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:10:41
Would you want to just continue?
2:10:43
So, I came back.
2:10:45
I started the shell of a paper about the ideas, talked to Jim [Sedell]
2:10:53
and Kelly Burnett, who was involved with the Northwest Forest Plan, and
2:10:56
Pete Bisson, who was also involved.
2:10:59
I also started talking to other people about, okay, did we really get it right?
2:11:06
I think we had the pieces right, but the question was about the interpretation
2:11:08
of the pieces and what that meant.
2:11:10
And so, that’s been a real focus of the career since then.
2:11:16
How well do you think the old-growth people got their section right,
2:11:19
which was often seen as the high-profile one [part of NWFP]
2:11:22
? Well, yeah.
2:11:22
Everybody thought about the big trees and the owl, but--?
2:11:27
Obviously, they were right, but they were right at the expense of not
2:11:33
thinking more broadly, you know.
2:11:35
How so?
2:11:37
For example, there’s
2:11:41
an acknowledgement that the early successional stage is also an
2:11:44
important thing to be managing for,
2:11:50
in terms of the very important ecological values of that.
2:11:56
That wasn’t even considered in FEMAT.
2:12:06
We did the best we could in 90 days, and we’ve learned a lot since then.
2:12:13
So, we just have to be honest about the assessments.
2:12:18
Now, in terms of listings, since then, have fish been listed?
2:12:25
Oh, yeah.
2:12:25
What ones [species] , how have they been impacted, and how has
2:12:27
that affected the implementation of the forest plan that you created?
2:12:35
At the time, what’s listed for fish, and particularly for salmon,
2:12:41
are what are called the ESU’s, or Evolutionarily Significant Units.
2:12:45
Rather than the whole species being listed, there are
2:12:52
population segments listed.
2:12:55
And so, the only one that was listed at the time we went into the Northwest
2:12:58
Forest Plan, was the Sacramento winter chinook, which was on some of the
2:13:05
forests, I think the Shasta-Trinity [National Forest] , and some other
2:13:11
ones in the southern part of northern California, the very southern end.
2:13:16
We had anticipated that there would be numerous
2:13:23
ESA listings once people got their petitions together.
2:13:32
This was all developed with the eye towards helping with that, to contribute
2:13:36
to the recovery of the populations that we thought were going to be
2:13:40
listed, or expected to be listed.
2:13:44
And so, we had a representative of NOAA Fisheries there right from
2:13:50
the get-go, and made sure that what we were doing would be acceptable
2:13:58
for the Forest Service and BLM in any consultation process.
2:14:02
This is FEMAT?
2:14:03
This is FEMAT, yeah.
2:14:04
We had a person there.
2:14:07
We even got a letter from NOAA Fisheries, saying if option [“alternative”] 9 was
2:14:10
selected, it would be sufficient for the Forest Service to meet ESA needs. Well,
2:14:20
there’s two things have contributed to the—the
2:14:26
option not being, I think, implemented as we fully expected.
2:14:30
One was the listing, and then, NOAA Fisheries decided that there
2:14:36
was going to be essentially no activity in the riparian reserves.
2:14:41
We had said we expected that there would be silvicultural activity for restoration
2:14:46
purposes in the riparian reserves, because many of the riparian reserves
2:14:50
were nothing but overstocked plantations.
2:14:53
With hatchery fish?
2:14:55
No, I mean with the trees.
2:14:56
Okay, I’m sorry.
2:14:59
Because prior to the Northwest Forest Plan, up until the late ‘70s and even
2:15:06
the early ‘80s, in many cases there were no riparian rules, and trees were
2:15:11
harvested right to the edge of the stream.
2:15:13
Then, in order to increase timber production, they planted Doug-fir,
2:15:20
primarily back in the riparian areas.
2:15:21
Regardless of what was there before?
2:15:22
Regardless of what was before.
2:15:23
Because it was the fastest-growing, commercially-conducive species?
2:15:23
There was
2:15:33
that mindset; we’re all about growing wood.
2:15:36
Well, it’s an agricultural model.
2:15:37
Exactly.
2:15:40
We knew one thing that had to be done was to restore these riparian
2:15:46
areas in terms of their vegetative structure, composition and diversity.
2:15:51
We fully expected that as part of the restoration process, there would be
2:15:57
silvicultural activity in there, to push these riparian zones back in a
2:16:02
direction we thought they needed to go.
2:16:04
Well, it turned out, the NOAA Fisheries decided after-the-fact, they weren’t
2:16:12
going to allow that to happen.
2:16:14
They were concerned about the effects on wood recruitment [delivery of big wood
2:16:18
to streams] , and water temperature.
2:16:19
They essentially said,
2:16:23
no activity in the riparian reserves.
2:16:27
The analysis I’m just doing now for the Northwest Forest Plan science census, by
2:16:34
our wildest guess, in the twenty years since the Northwest Forest
2:16:42
Plan was implemented, maybe three percent of the total riparian reserves
2:16:46
in the Northwest Forest Plan area had activity [cutting of trees] in them.
2:16:51
Three percent.
2:16:53
Now, even though they weren’t listed, what was your concern and that of Jim Sedell
2:16:58
and your team, what were the species, let’s stick with fish, first of all, you
2:17:02
can address invertebrates and other parts of the organic [food] chain, shall we say.
2:17:06
Yeah, right.
2:17:08
What were the fish you were most concerned with?
2:17:10
First of all, there’s commercial interests, and, shall we say, the
2:17:13
charismatic fish, if you want to use that term, but also the fish that are important
2:17:17
to the whole system, that may not be commercially important or well-known.
2:17:19
Well, the focus was primarily on the Pacific Salmon, the genus Oncorhynchus.
2:17:24
Okay.
2:17:28
So that’s the steelheads, chinook salmon, coho salmon; those were the big three.
2:17:33
Okay.
2:17:33
And then there’s pink salmon and chum salmon, and to a lesser extent, sockeye,
2:17:38
and some others in a few spots in the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:17:41
The silver?
2:17:42
The silver is a coho.
2:17:44
Coho, right.
2:17:45
So, the coho, chinook and steelhead were the big three, and then there
2:17:51
were cutthroat and bull trout.
2:17:55
And bull trout are in some areas, a char, they’re not a salmon.
2:18:01
But those were the biggies that were being analyzed, where the focus really was.
2:18:09
There still was a commercial-economic center that wasn’t purely ecological?
2:18:15
Yeah, the idea was, there
2:18:18
was a
2:18:21
big economy built around the commercial fishing.
2:18:25
How involved were the Indian tribes?
2:18:28
Hardly at all.
2:18:29
During the process, before and after?
2:18:32
Not hardly at all.
2:18:35
Now, I’m trying to think when the Boldt Decision came in.
2:18:41
Boldt, I think,
2:18:44
was slightly before FEMAT; I want to say 1989 or something.
2:18:49
[– Washington state Indian tribes given equal fishing rights and responsibility
2:18:49
to manage resources.] But in the Northwest Forest Plan area, there
2:18:52
really isn’t a lot of interactions between the tribal nations, the
2:19:02
Forest Service and BLM.
2:19:04
Well, not any more.
2:19:05
Not anymore.
2:19:05
Because of what’s happened in history.
2:19:07
It’s not like the Columbia.
2:19:09
Right.
2:19:10
There’s some, you know, the big area for that is in northern California,
2:19:15
with the Yuroks, Hoopas, and Kuroks.
2:19:19
I can’t remember the other tribes.
2:19:20
In the Redwood zone, right?
2:19:21
In the Redwood zone and up into the upper Klamath [river basin] there.
2:19:26
All right.
2:19:26
But for the most part, there wasn’t a lot of tribal involvement.
2:19:31
How did it affect their lands, though?
2:19:33
I mean, were they immune from the zoning [NWFP] or not?
2:19:40
They were zoned the same way, weren’t they?
2:19:41
Well, outside of the Coquille tribe, they
2:19:49
each had their own lands.
2:19:50
It was not affected by the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:19:53
So, that’s my question is about how they were involved in some way.
2:19:57
They certainly have been in the reports and the follow-ups.
2:20:00
Right.
2:20:01
But they were not central players?
2:20:02
No.
2:20:03
Okay.
2:20:03
And the big aftermath of the Northwest Forest Plan, particularly with
2:20:09
regards to the riparian areas, is it
2:20:16
put a lot of focus on the states and their riparian regulatory
2:20:24
conditions.
2:20:29
The State of Washington moved really close to what was in the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:20:34
The State of Oregon just dug in its heels and it hasn’t modified hardly anything.
2:20:39
In terms of?
2:20:40
The size of riparian areas or what you can do in them.
2:20:45
California also made some pretty significant changes.
2:20:49
Why do you think the difference is there in the cultures and the governments?
2:20:52
[Washington, Oregon and Washington]
2:20:52
. I think it’s how much political clout the industry has in Oregon
2:20:59
compared to California and Washington.
2:21:02
Even today?
2:21:03
Even today.
2:21:05
Because the skyline, if I want to call it that, in Eugene where I grew
2:21:09
up, doesn’t look the same as it used to, when smokestacks were everywhere.
2:21:13
Oh, yeah.
2:21:14
And you couldn’t swim in the Willamette River.
2:21:16
Oh, yeah, yeah.
2:21:17
But the power is still there.
2:21:20
Yeah.
2:21:22
But Washington is different; Weyerhaeuser was bigtime up there,
2:21:25
and it’s just a different dynamic.
2:21:28
Yeah.
2:21:33
And I have no idea how true this is, but someone has said the biggest supporters
2:21:38
of the Northwest Forest Plan have been Weyerhaeuser and Georgia Pacific.
2:21:43
[Have large private timber holdings]
2:21:45
Because?
2:21:45
Because it took the federal lands out of competition.
2:21:49
They had such huge, private land stocks, that
2:21:54
this would push prices up.
2:21:55
If you go back to D.C. and look behind the scenes about who is actually pushing
2:22:00
for support of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:22:06
How interesting.
2:22:07
So, it was the medium and smaller players that got really hurt by this?
2:22:13
Yes and no.
2:22:14
The hurt was already there.
2:22:18
What’s really hurt the industry is automation.
2:22:22
The industry wants to blame the federal government.
2:22:24
But truth be told that, mills dare run now with a fraction of the
2:22:29
people that it took historically.
2:22:29
And the other
2:22:33
thing is, who wants big logs?
2:22:38
Mills aren’t geared for big logs.
2:22:40
Well, the smart ones [mills] retrofitted for smaller and medium logs.
2:22:44
Right, exactly.
2:22:46
And so, you look at what is in demand from an industry perspective
2:22:52
now, it’s not a big tree.
2:22:54
It’s a tree you can get a two-by-four or two-by-six out of, so you can
2:22:58
laminate it together to make a big beam.
2:23:02
Which are stronger anyway.
2:23:03
Which is stronger anyway, exactly.
2:23:04
Yeah.
2:23:05
Right, yeah.
2:23:09
So,
2:23:11
how did things shake out in the first few years after this, you’re talking
2:23:15
about coming back from New Zealand.
2:23:17
Eventually, you became part of this assessment [NWFP monitoring] team.
2:23:22
Yeah, yeah.
2:23:22
Just kind of tell me how that shakes out, and then start taking me through
2:23:26
the process of the five- and the ten-year reviews, just looking at things.
2:23:31
I was thinking back on how after the Gang of Four, Norm, I and the group,
2:23:38
felt what we should do is go around and explain to every national forest
2:23:44
what we did and why we did it, so they could understand our assessments.
2:23:49
So, Norm and I went on a speaking tour.
2:23:51
Norm and I were the ones designated to do it.
2:23:55
We went to every national forest.
2:23:58
In three states?
2:23:58
In three states.
2:24:01
And made a presentation to the [national] forests on what we
2:24:06
did, why we did it, how we did it.
2:24:08
And this would have been ’90?
2:24:10
This is ’92, probably.
2:24:11
So this is before the pink tower [FEMAT-] and all that?
2:24:14
Okay, so it’s after the original meeting.
2:24:16
Got you.
2:24:16
Yeah, after the Gang of Four [report] came out.
2:24:17
Okay, got you.
2:24:19
And we went to every national forest, sat down
2:24:25
with them, and went over the gory details of what we did and why.
2:24:28
They would ask us why did we say something, and I would just pull out
2:24:33
the forest plan, and say, look, I didn’t say anything other than what you said.
2:24:44
So, here it is.
2:24:46
Here it is in black and white.
2:24:48
“But, we didn’t say that.” [They might say as example]
2:24:51
And so, they generally went into denial mode?
2:24:54
Yeah, yeah.
2:24:55
And then, what we later learned, was many fish biologists had slipped
2:25:00
things in at the last minute.
2:25:05
The local fish biologists, not you guys?
2:25:11
So, you found out there was subterfuge going on at the forest level?
2:25:17
Wow, interesting.
2:25:20
Did anybody lose their job over this that you know about?
2:25:24
You know who took the biggest hit in this whole thing, Willa Nehlsen, who
2:25:27
works for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
2:25:28
Willa Nehlsen.
2:25:30
She
2:25:34
was the lead author on “Salmon at the Crossroads,” and her career was ruined.
2:25:41
Because it went against the power structure.
2:25:46
Did she leave Fish and Wildlife?
2:25:48
Eventually.
2:25:49
You know, it shifted back to D.C. and then they sent her to
2:25:54
“Podunk.” [Unattractive or remote agency posting]
2:25:55
In essence, sending her to Siberia.
2:25:57
Exactly.
2:25:58
Yeah.
2:25:59
That’s always kind of sad when that happens, isn’t it?
2:26:01
Oh, I know, I feel so bad for her.
2:26:04
She paid such a price.
2:26:06
Now, you guys did not.
2:26:08
Nope.
2:26:10
So, do you have any particular anecdotes in remembering about your march across the
2:26:17
territory and meeting all these people, some of whom were probably not too happy?
2:26:21
Some
2:26:24
people.
2:26:26
Like
2:26:29
when we went to Mount Hood.
2:26:30
One thing that happened, is the forest leadership people were not
2:26:34
allowed into the Coliseum when we were doing the Gang of Four.
2:26:38
If they came, they had to wear an orange vest when they went out on the
2:26:43
floor to look, and they couldn’t talk.
2:26:46
They had to wear an orange vest and they couldn’t talk to anybody.
2:26:49
Anybody outside of who was working, people from the Washington office
2:26:54
came, they’d put on an orange vest.
2:26:56
The chief, I can’t remember if he came, I want to say he
2:26:57
did, but I don’t know for sure.
2:26:57
Well, Robertson [Dale] was there then.
2:26:57
[USFS Chief]
2:27:01
{ Yeah.
2:27:01
He was there until ’93.
2:27:02
Right, I know, but people were coming, and Jack Ward Thomas was adamant that
2:27:07
they would wear this orange vest.
2:27:09
I bet they didn’t like that very much.
2:27:11
No, some people found humor in it.
2:27:13
Like I remember when we went to the Mount Hood
2:27:19
[National Forest] . We went to the Mount Hood and they made Norm and I
2:27:21
wear orange vests when we were talking.
2:27:23
It was a joke.
2:27:24
I still have the orange vest in my office.
2:27:26
It’s funny, though.
2:27:28
[Laughter].
2:27:28
No, no, no.
2:27:28
All’s fair in, you know, all’s fair here in love and war.
2:27:31
Yeah, it’s like, payback’s a bitch, right?
2:27:33
Exactly.
2:27:33
No, no, no, it was really funny.
2:27:36
We went to the Siskiyou.
2:27:38
And there were two people who were really belligerent.
2:27:43
We went to the Siskiyou and there were two guys, the planner and somebody
2:27:49
else, I can’t remember who it was.
2:27:51
They started giving me a hard time about how I could say anything about
2:27:55
what they were doing, how I could say that there were issues with fish.
2:28:00
And I was explaining that I just read the forest plans.
2:28:08
“Well, you shouldn’t say that sort of stuff.” I said, “Look, someone asked me
2:28:13
what I think, what I know, and it’s my job to tell them.” And then they got all over
2:28:22
Norm.
2:28:24
Like ugly?
2:28:25
Oh, ugly, yeah.
2:28:26
I mean, it was getting ugly with me, but when they turned
2:28:28
to Norm, they just unleashed.
2:28:30
And Norm finally, they were recording, this whole thing was being recorded, and
2:28:34
Norm said, “Turn off the camera.” And he went and he got in these two guys’ faces.
2:28:41
He said, “You will not do that anymore. This is disrespectful and a disservice
2:28:47
to both of us. And we are not going to tolerate that anymore.” And turned back
2:28:51
on the camera, and it was all over.
2:28:54
And then we went to the Siuslaw, and the guy, he was the planner,
2:29:01
threatened to beat me up.
2:29:04
Threatened fisticuffs?
2:29:05
He got up and he was coming at me, and people grabbed him.
2:29:11
Norm stepped in and said, “We’re not going to do this.” And this guy, just
2:29:16
every couple of minutes, was just ready, “I was the worst, you know, SOB he’d
2:29:21
ever met,” blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2:29:23
How could I do this?
2:29:24
I worked for the same organization.
2:29:35
Continue with the fisticuffs.
2:29:38
Oh, you know, there were definitely some hard feelings.
2:29:43
Basically, because their world view and their paradigm was threatened?
2:29:47
That, and I think they felt embarrassed that someone would say
2:29:52
that they weren’t doing a good job.
2:29:54
That’s how it was construed.
2:29:57
And they, and the truth be told, they were doing what they were told, there was
2:30:03
a tremendous amount of pressure on them, and they had to deal with the agency.
2:30:08
Well, the traditional agency powers were pressuring them to keep the old way going.
2:30:12
Exactly.
2:30:13
And what you guys did was like a punch in the gut?
2:30:15
Well, yeah, and some people were saying, it was like, wow,
2:30:21
it is about time this happened.
2:30:24
And I’m so glad you did this because we’ve been suffering
2:30:27
with this for years, and so.
2:30:33
So, you did this and you came back from this.
2:30:36
What came out of that particular experience, other than more information
2:30:42
and experience you took toward FEMAT?
2:30:45
Because, we’re jumping back in time here.
2:30:46
Yeah.
2:30:49
The Gang of Four sort of set the foundation for moving into
2:30:51
FEMAT, which is one of the reasons we could do it in ninety days.
2:30:55
Because you had a lot done already?
2:30:57
We had a lot of that done already.
2:30:58
Yeah.
2:30:59
So, what I was always listening for, is the science wrong?
2:31:05
Is the logic or the science assessment wrong?
2:31:07
Because that’s your job.
2:31:08
That’s, yeah.
2:31:09
You’re not a politician, you’re a scientist.
2:31:11
Correct?
2:31:11
My thing was, okay, did we not put something together right?
2:31:16
Did we not interpret something right that led us to some conclusion?
2:31:21
That’s what I wanted to hear.
2:31:22
I
2:31:25
would ask straight up--is there something wrong with the logic or
2:31:28
the science that we put into this?
2:31:31
They all said no, but some said, “But, you shouldn’t have done it.”
2:31:35
Okay. All the no’s, you had me at no.
2:31:39
You know, that is how I was looking at it.
2:31:43
Do you feel that anybody in the FEMAT group, or any of the other
2:31:47
people, ever steered toward advocacy, or was science a pretty
2:31:52
consistent rudder for the experience?
2:31:56
I can tell you with absolute truthfulness, in all of these
2:32:02
efforts, we never discussed
2:32:07
whether we liked an option
2:32:12
or not.
2:32:14
We never said, I like option 1, or I like option 9, or I like option 8.
2:32:19
[“Alternative”- term used in NWFP] We never had that discussion, and
2:32:26
there was never even any attempt to do that in any of these things
2:32:30
that I have been involved with.
2:32:33
What involvement or pressure came from the environmentalist-activist
2:32:37
side of things in the lead up to the ISC, the congressional
2:32:42
hearings, FEMAT, and all that?
2:32:44
What was the noise on the outside, but also their involvement, during maybe
2:32:48
the public participation portions of it?
2:32:54
There were two things that I can think of.
2:32:57
And I learned one of them after the fact.
2:32:59
I asked Norm, “So how did you end up calling me to be
2:33:07
involved with the Gang of Four?”
2:33:12
I was barely out of grad school, I had a few publications, that sort of stuff.
2:33:20
I said, “So, why me?” And “why not” he said, “We wanted you, we knew
2:33:25
we had to get Jim because we all liked Jim, but Jim was a great idea
2:33:32
guy but didn’t really carry through on stuff, and didn’t know how to
2:33:36
explain things really well,” he said.
2:33:40
I said, “So, why me, Norm?” And he said, “Well,
2:33:45
we were told by George Miller,” who was from northern California in
2:33:52
the Bay Area, he was in the House Interior Committee or something.
2:33:55
He was a pretty powerful guy.
2:33:56
George Miller from California, the Democratic congressman?
2:33:59
Yeah, yeah.
2:33:59
Okay.
2:34:00
I was thinking of somebody that was in the Forest Service or the
2:34:02
university at Humboldt State.
2:34:05
We were told by George Miller that he would sanction our effort if we brought
2:34:12
one of three people into this effort.
2:34:16
He said it was myself, Reed Noss, or Dave Perry.
2:34:25
How did he know you?
2:34:27
It was the Pacific Rivers Council,
2:34:35
which was in discussions with George Miller.
2:34:39
George was saying, if you had, who would you put on this group,
2:34:43
if we can get somebody on?
2:34:47
And the Rivers Council gave him my name.
2:34:49
And
2:34:51
your life was changed forever.
2:34:53
And my life, forever, yeah.
2:34:55
So, Norm told me they talked about it, the group talked, the four of
2:35:00
them [Gang of Four] talked about it.
2:35:01
And they didn’t feel like they needed any more terrestrial people.
2:35:04
They talked that maybe they
2:35:08
should have an aquatic person.
2:35:09
Well, they had to reassess even the paradigm of their pre-planning planning.
2:35:15
[New process and world-view]
2:35:15
Oh, yeah.
2:35:16
Because they said, “Oh, my God, we’ve got to bring a fisheries guy
2:35:18
in.” Well, you need to bring in a full team, not just a couple guys?
2:35:21
Right, and then we go back, and as Jerry tells it; Harold Volkmer, Congressman
2:35:37
from Missouri [Democrat] , in the Natural Resources and Merchant Marine Committee
2:35:40
in the House, something to that effect.
2:35:41
Harold Volkmer was chair of that committee.
2:35:42
He said to these guys, I want you to resolve this, and he made
2:35:48
this off-hand comment, “Don’t let some damn fish scuttle this.”
2:35:55
He was just making a joke, but they took it seriously. So with George
2:35:58
Miller saying he would sanction the Gang of Four effort if they
2:36:03
took one of these three people [identified earlier in transcript] , they
2:36:05
settled on a fish/aquatics person.”
2:36:07
Can
2:36:09
you imagine a discussion like this happening with today’s Congress?
2:36:13
No.
2:36:15
No.
2:36:16
I don’t mean to get too political, but yeah.
2:36:18
But then, you know, it was interesting.
2:36:21
One time, we
2:36:24
were called back to D.C. by George Miller, the six of us were called back.
2:36:32
We went into his office, and he had this office off his office,
2:36:39
which was like his private office.
2:36:43
We were sitting down, and he wanted to know if the enviros were trying
2:36:47
to really expand the amount of old growth, and this was in the Gang of
2:36:53
Four [report] that they wanted in.
2:36:55
What we discovered was
2:36:59
that there were a bunch of enviros who had these private inholdings inside these
2:37:05
old growth areas, and they were adding on where their particular cabins were.
2:37:12
So, this is what you’d call a bad manifestation of limousine liberalism?
2:37:18
Yes.
2:37:19
Yes.
2:37:20
And he was
2:37:26
furious, and Jerry was the one that figured it out.
2:37:30
And we were looking at all of these maps and they’re trying to
2:37:32
add all these things down here.
2:37:33
I’m like, what the hell?
2:37:34
There was this little postage stamp thing and
2:37:39
they weren’t going to support it unless they got, these things got added in.
2:37:43
And Jerry figured it out.
2:37:45
Was this like, what rich groups are we talking about?
2:37:50
I don’t remember.
2:37:50
Can’t remember?
2:37:51
Yeah.
2:37:52
But
2:37:54
he was just furious.
2:37:56
I mean, he cussed them up one side and down the other.
2:38:01
He said, there was this classic statement that we all repeat.
2:38:06
He said, “You know, you guys stopped the stagecoach, gave the enviros
2:38:14
the strong box, and now they’re sticking around for their watches and their
2:38:19
rings, and they’re gonna get shot.
2:38:21
They’re going to lose the whole thing.” And that was his
2:38:23
analogy about what was going on.
2:38:27
So, what did the environmentalists legitimately want?
2:38:30
You know, aside from these selfish, little things.
2:38:32
Well, I think that the thing was, they wanted old growth.
2:38:38
They wanted—
2:38:38
As much as possible?
2:38:39
As much as possible.
2:38:40
Right.
2:38:42
And at that time, what was estimated what was the left?
2:38:45
Oh, it was just a fraction.
2:38:46
Five, ten percent?
2:38:47
Something like that, yeah.
2:38:48
I mean, similarly, isn’t it the estimate of the redwoods that were basically
2:38:53
salvaged through the little park system down in northern California,
2:38:56
something like five to eight percent?
2:38:59
Yeah, just some small remnant population, a segment of what was there originally.
2:39:05
But they were more concerned with the old growth and the charismatic
2:39:10
species like the spotted owl.
2:39:13
They weren’t as focused on riparian stuff?
2:39:16
No, but once once we surfaced that issue--
2:39:22
Then they glommed onto it?
2:39:24
Then they glommed on it bigtime, yeah.
2:39:26
How did that manifest itself, both during the planning process and since?
2:39:32
They have just
2:39:35
been pushing really hard that nothing happen in there, and
2:39:38
keep it as big as possible.
2:39:39
In terms of the riparian reserves, correct?
2:39:41
Yes.
2:39:42
How does that intersect with laws like the Clean Water Act,
2:39:47
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act?
2:39:48
How were those things tied in with what you guys did?
2:39:53
The Clean Water Act was a real big part of it, because trying to minimize
2:40:02
any additional listing that
2:40:06
is in 303[d] [section of Clean Water Act concerning listing of impaired waters]
2:40:08
, where the listings occur, you know, and prevent things from going on from there,
2:40:12
or helping them in avoiding legal issues.
2:40:18
So,
2:40:20
yeah, so there was a lot of stuff going on.
2:40:26
So, tell me about the aftermath and how your involvement developed after
2:40:32
the plan was actually implemented.
2:40:34
Oh, wait.
2:40:35
I will first go back to address the following: Please clarify,
2:40:39
what are Tier 1 and Tier 2?
2:40:42
Key watersheds?
2:40:43
Yes, yes.
2:40:45
The key watershed idea was developed back in
2:40:51
the Gang of Four.
2:40:52
The idea was that we would have watersheds distributed throughout the Northwest
2:40:57
Forest Plan area where there was an emphasis on managing for aquatic values,
2:41:02
and these were the key watersheds.
2:41:05
The Tier 1 key watersheds were
2:41:09
watersheds that had either existing strong populations of fish and good
2:41:14
habitat, or in the judgment of the various fish biologists, had the
2:41:21
best potential for restoration.
2:41:23
Additionally, some people were concerned about drinking
2:41:24
water, so we developed Tier 2
2:41:39
watersheds to protect municipal drinking water sources.
2:41:42
Like, for instance, Bull Run in Portland, right?
2:41:46
Bull Run in Portland, or the Ashland watershed [southern Oregon]
2:41:48
. Or the McKenzie in Eugene?
2:41:49
Exactly, yeah.
2:41:51
Where does Corvallis get its water, by
2:41:54
the way?
2:41:54
The Willamette, this time of year, it’s primarily Willamette.
2:41:59
But during the winter, it’s, oh,
2:42:03
God, where?
2:42:03
Mary’s River?
2:42:04
It’s not the Mary’s, it’s a tributary of
2:42:11
the Mary’s, not Greasy Creek.
2:42:18
Anyhow, it’s out there.
2:42:19
[Rock Creek on the east flank of Mary’s Peak in the Siuslaw National Forest.]
2:42:19
It doesn’t matter.
2:42:20
Anyway, back to what we were talking about.
2:42:22
How did your role develop and crystallize as the plan is, it’s in place, it’s the
2:42:30
law of the land, and you’re going forward?
2:42:32
How long before you started to develop a monitoring assessment review process?
2:42:39
Well, it took almost ten years.
2:42:41
Right.
2:42:42
And that’s because the agencies couldn’t agree.
2:42:47
You’re talking about BLM and Forest Service?
2:42:49
Well, it was BLM, Forest Service, EPA, and [National] Park Service.
2:42:57
NOAA?
2:42:57
And NOAA.
2:42:58
Okay.
2:43:00
What was the debate, and what was the disagreement?
2:43:04
In all sincerity, I stayed out
2:43:08
of it.
2:43:08
I just kept my head low and was dealing with other things.
2:43:15
Finally,
2:43:18
the RIETS, or Regional Interagency Executive Team, made up
2:43:31
of representatives from each of the major agencies, who are to oversee
2:43:36
management implementation, asked me to help, as there had been three or
2:43:44
four unsuccessful attempts to come up with something everybody could
2:43:47
agree upon, and they needed this done.
2:43:48
You mean, just even a schematic for doing it?
2:43:50
Yeah, they couldn’t even get it.
2:43:52
Is that because of the
2:43:59
interlocking oversight of different areas or
2:44:02
-- ? Yeah, it was that, and nobody
2:44:08
knew how to deal with this thing called a watershed.
2:44:11
Nobody had ever monitored it before.
2:44:14
How do you define a watershed?
2:44:19
We define it
2:44:24
by the 6th level field hydrologic unit system from the Watershed
2:44:24
Boundary Dataset [WBD] layer for Oregon, a data-set delineated to
2:44:25
the 6th level drainage systems.
2:44:25
Their boundaries are defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria
2:44:25
that delineate an area of land upstream from a specific point on a river,
2:44:25
stream, or similar surface waters.
2:44:26
I can’t remember the exact acreage of
2:44:34
the aquatic landscape.
2:44:37
It’s characterized these days by what are called hydrologic unit codes.
2:44:41
A
2:44:45
small one, like the smallest watershed at the top, gets two
2:44:50
numbers, and that’s a first order,
2:44:55
a first code.
2:44:58
Then, the aggregation of those at some point gets a second and third.
2:45:02
A sixth is something the size of like the Mary’s River, or
2:45:10
Elk River on the south coast [Oregon] . The Alsea is probably
2:45:25
a fourth or third code.
2:45:27
Anyhow, it’s
2:45:31
defined on an aerial basis, the drainage of a given area in
2:45:40
its entirety.
2:45:41
So,
2:45:46
if you look at the Aquatic Conservation Strategy [NWFP] , that’s what it’s about;
2:45:50
what are the watersheds and maintaining the integrity of those watersheds.
2:45:54
And so, the monitoring naturally should be about these watersheds.
2:46:00
Whatever that unit was.
2:46:01
Whatever that unit was.
2:46:02
Right.
2:46:03
And people couldn’t agree on how to do it.
2:46:07
Was that also because some of the watersheds were cut up
2:46:09
in terms of who owned what?
2:46:11
That was part
2:46:15
of it, so that was one of the big challenges.
2:46:17
When you have some 6th field watersheds, only five percent of it might be federal.
2:46:24
Well, that, and particularly for the BLM, that’s what really came into play
2:46:29
with the checkerboards [land ownership] . You couldn’t effectively monitor.
2:46:37
I mean, you could monitor it, but could you really look at the effectiveness
2:46:41
of the Northwest Forest Plan, or the aquatic conservation strategy, when
2:46:44
ninety-five percent of the watershed is being affected by something else?
2:46:49
How did you come to the point, after ten years, to decide on what to do?
2:46:53
Yeah.
2:46:53
How did you decide what to do, and when you did what did that reveal about what
2:46:59
was happening with aquatic resources, what had happened since implementation
2:47:02
of the plan, and how effective the plan and its various parts were?
2:47:09
Well, the development took probably about a year.
2:47:13
And I think it helped, because I had a real understanding about what was
2:47:20
intended and could explain it to people.
2:47:26
Then maybe it was just the particular group that got together, we sort of
2:47:32
started rallying around my way of doing it, which is, you don’t go for
2:47:37
the home run, let’s hit singles first.
2:47:40
When we get the bases loaded, then we can talk.
2:47:42
So,
2:47:44
it started small.
2:47:45
Okay, can we agree on X?
2:47:47
We agree on Y, and then started putting it together.
2:47:50
Now, if we can agree on X, Y and Z, how do we pull that together?
2:47:55
I remember, one of the big issues was, is there such a thing as a watershed?
2:48:03
EPA says no.
2:48:06
If you look at the Clean Water Act and the monitoring for the Clean
2:48:09
Water Act, it’s in stream miles.
2:48:13
They talk about the number of stream miles that are impaired.
2:48:17
They don’t recognize the ecological unit of a watershed.
2:48:22
Which is more of a point-source pollution model, like their original,
2:48:27
you know, based on the evils of industrialism, in other words?
2:48:27
Exactly, right.
2:48:31
So, you know, it was going back-and-forth with the folks from EPA.
2:48:37
And finally, what we ended up doing was a person from EPA and myself,
2:48:42
and we debated about the merits of a watershed, or the points type of approach.
2:48:49
We debated between the Director of PNW, the Director of the
2:48:56
USGS Research Group, and EPA.
2:48:59
And then those three voted on whether the group should do
2:49:00
watersheds or point source.
2:49:00
And?
2:49:00
They voted on
2:49:15
watersheds.
2:49:16
Doesn’t that fit in tune with what the whole?
2:49:18
[NWFP model]
2:49:18
Oh, totally, yeah.
2:49:19
I mean, it was—
2:49:21
Holism behind the concept, anyway.
2:49:22
Yeah, it was a rigged vote, because the PNW wasn’t going to vote against
2:49:27
me, and the EPA wasn’t going to vote against their guy and their policies.
2:49:33
Right?
2:49:36
Exactly.
2:49:36
Yeah.
2:49:37
So anyway.
2:49:38
But we did it.
2:49:39
So, you got it in place.
2:49:40
Yeah.
2:49:41
You’re doing the monitoring, and that’s through today?
2:49:43
For ten years?
2:49:45
Twenty.
2:49:45
No, but I mean—
2:49:47
Well, we went back, and because some of it was not being done,
2:49:52
things you could be doing, measuring remotely, like the number of roads,
2:49:57
number of other things, vegetation patterns, and that sort of stuff.
2:50:01
So, you historically reconstructed the ten years before?
2:50:03
Yeah.
2:50:05
And
2:50:09
so we’ve done a ten, a fifteen, and now, we just finished up a twenty-year report.
2:50:15
Taking the major points of the plan, your goals, your hopes,
2:50:22
what have the reviews told you?
2:50:25
The monitoring had basically said we’re making slow, steady progress in terms
2:50:31
of improving watershed conditions.
2:50:35
One thing about the assessment of option 9 from an aquatic perspective, if you
2:50:41
look at it, it was the lowest of the various components, considering it was
2:50:47
lower than owls, or it was lower than old growth, it was lower than murrelets
2:50:53
and everything else.
2:50:54
You mean, in terms of its grade, meaning forest health?
2:50:56
Yeah,
2:50:58
how well we thought it would work.
2:51:01
I meant your predictions were right.
2:51:03
So there was this assessment.
2:51:04
The White House wanted us to assess it.
2:51:06
To predict if this going to work, what’s your chance of success.
2:51:10
Exactly.
2:51:12
They restricted it, and there were two things.
2:51:14
They restricted it to 100 years.
2:51:16
Will this be successful, and what will things look like in 100 years?
2:51:20
Will there be a vast improvement, small improvement, so on and so forth.
2:51:27
We said there will be improvement, but that it would
2:51:30
probably be relatively small.
2:51:32
It’s going to take a long
2:51:36
time, and this has nothing to do with logging, nothing to do with it.
2:51:40
With modern logging, these systems have been vastly mistreated for a long time.
2:51:46
And it’s going to take a long time for them to recover.
2:51:50
Now, the White House didn’t particularly like that, because they wanted everything
2:51:54
to be like really high up there.
2:51:56
This is back in the Clinton administration?
2:51:59
This is the Clinton administration.
2:52:01
They didn’t like that.
2:52:04
They asked us to “reassess,” and I said, “No.” I told Jim
2:52:09
we’re not going to do that.
2:52:11
That’s our answer, the final answer.
2:52:15
And nothing,
2:52:19
we would do nothing different the second time around, so we just told
2:52:21
Jack that we weren’t going to do it.
2:52:22
So, you didn’t.
2:52:22
Yeah,
2:52:28
we
2:52:31
didn’t.
2:52:33
Concerning the ten years to now, and you’re going to look back at the
2:52:36
previous ten years, and off towards twenty, if you were going to draw a
2:52:40
sketch since then, how would you state what has happened, what goals were met,
2:52:47
what goals were not met, and what are the hopes and plans for the future?
2:52:51
Well, there has been a steady improvement.
2:52:56
And in part, one of the major things has been road-decommissioning.
2:53:02
So, I think there’s been a major effort by the agencies,
2:53:06
particularly in the key watersheds.
2:53:08
In other words, reducing erosion, sedimentation and turbidity in the water?
2:53:12
Yeah, all the things that go along with the roads.
2:53:15
Right.
2:53:16
There had been a major effort, a concerted effort, particularly in the
2:53:20
key watersheds, to get rid of the roads.
2:53:25
So that’s been quite good.
2:53:27
There’s been, just because of
2:53:33
natural growth, an increase in the size of large trees in the riparian areas.
2:53:38
However, two things that were just surfacing in the twenty-year science
2:53:45
censuses, is that, as I talked about, only a very small fraction of
2:53:54
these plantations, these overstocked
2:53:59
conifer plantations, have been treated [logged] in the last twenty
2:54:08
years.
2:54:08
What we’re finding out, and NOAA does operate on the
2:54:16
assumption if we don’t anything and that we’re having no effect,
2:54:20
we won’t have any negative effect.
2:54:23
But what we’re finding out is
2:54:28
it appears not doing anything is actually having effects, and they’re not good.
2:54:35
What we’re doing is suppressing the development of diverse vegetation in
2:54:42
the riparian areas, so we’re losing.
2:54:44
How so?
2:54:45
Well, we’re losing hardwoods.
2:54:47
Two things, we’re losing the hardwood component,
2:54:51
and the hardwoods with the leaves and stuff, is a major energy
2:54:57
source for many of these streams.
2:54:59
The organic, the biogeochemistry
2:55:03
of what’s in
2:55:03
-- ? The food chain.
2:55:04
So it’s likely we’re having quite significant effects on the food chain.
2:55:08
In other words, having “too coniferous” of a forest.
2:55:10
Right, exactly.
2:55:12
It actually is hurting the biogeochemistry and the decomposition
2:55:12
chain in the riparian system.
2:55:12
And so, you have this
2:55:19
cascading effect with the food chain.
2:55:22
That’s one aspect of it.
2:55:24
The other thing is, we’re retarding the development of the largest trees that
2:55:30
really need to get into the channel.
2:55:32
Historically, if you look at
2:55:37
“unmanaged stands,”
2:55:40
the largest trees came from really close to the channels where you
2:55:43
had low densities of conifers.
2:55:46
Now we’ve got these dog-hair plantations the regulatory agencies
2:55:53
don’t want any activity in.
2:55:57
Which does what to the riparian ecosystem?
2:55:59
It retards development of the big trees, and eventually, the recruitment
2:56:04
of those trees to the channel.
2:56:06
That’s one thing, and then, we’re finding that fire suppression has an effect.
2:56:12
The absence of fire in these landscapes is having some pretty
2:56:15
significant ecological implications.
2:56:20
Fire is a
2:56:23
major disturbance in these systems, and after fires, we had landslides,
2:56:28
debris flows and other erosion events, that delivered sediment and wood to
2:56:34
the channels, which are the basic building blocks for good fish habitat.
2:56:40
We’ve completely altered that process.
2:56:43
Many of these systems where we haven’t had fire in a long time, are
2:56:48
now particularly sediment-starved.
2:56:52
What does that do nutritionally to the food chain, not just to
2:56:57
the fish, but what they eat?
2:56:58
Nutritionally, it has to do with the complexity of the substrates.
2:57:03
So, there’s two things.
2:57:04
One, if you’ve got a stream bed that is
2:57:09
either larger materials or bedrock, you can’t deform it to form pools.
2:57:16
Also, you don’t have any inter-gravel flow that helps cool water, and finally,
2:57:22
you don’t then have the variety of substrates to support the invertebrates.
2:57:22
Part of the food chain.
2:57:22
Yeah, so
2:57:28
there’s all kinds of implications we never even thought about.
2:57:32
How about the chemical breakdown of the water in that kind of situation?
2:57:32
What is it starving?
2:57:32
[biota] What is it missing?
2:57:32
[chemical/mechanical]
2:57:32
It’s going to be missing a lot of nutrients because you don’t have the
2:57:32
processing of deciduous [plant] material.
2:57:32
There is no place to store it.
2:57:32
How much of the dynamics of breakdown
2:57:44
[erosion, hydrology,
2:57:50
biogeochemical] and
2:57:54
things going into rivers and streams, is mechanical, and
2:57:58
how much of it is chemical, in terms of supporting the system?
2:58:01
It’s a combination of both.
2:58:05
The transport is going to be the mechanical aspects of it.
2:58:09
The
2:58:12
actual chemical breakdown is more bacterial, and the invertebrates,
2:58:20
the bacteria and fungi actually decomposing the leaves, and then
2:58:24
the invertebrates coming in and eating the fungi and bacteria.
2:58:28
But when I mean mechanical, I also mean—
2:58:31
Well, just the transport of it.
2:58:31
The mechanical nature of things once they’re there, creating
2:58:35
pools and places of harbor.
2:58:37
Well, yeah, but in order to create a pool, it’s not just bringing in wood, you’ve
2:58:43
got to have something to form the bed.
2:58:45
The whole, right.
2:58:48
We’re changing that process.
2:58:53
Instead of like in the past, in which periodic influxes of these materials,
2:58:58
these building blocks, enter the system and are has some period to work with it.
2:59:03
One can imagine, the transitions may not be real favorable in the
2:59:07
beginning, but it transitions into something, and it’s really favorable,
2:59:11
and then it’s going to dip down.
2:59:14
The other aspect of it is when you look across these landscapes
2:59:20
historically.
2:59:21
The way fires operated on this landscape, is the whole landscape didn’t
2:59:26
burn, but there were patches left.
2:59:28
You can imagine the variability in conditions amongst these watersheds
2:59:33
that existed historically.
2:59:37
There’s this myth that in the “good-old days,” you could have walked across
2:59:43
the back of salmon in any stream in Oregon. You know, that didn’t exist.
2:59:48
It’s the “golden age” mythology that exists everywhere in all cultures.
2:59:53
Exactly.
2:59:53
Yeah, and so, we have these false expectations or illusions that
3:00:01
are really difficult to overcome.
3:00:05
The “good-old days.”
3:00:06
Yeah, right.
3:00:08
So, you’re doing the twenty-year synthesis now.
3:00:09
Correct?
3:00:10
Right.
3:00:10
Is this what you’re telling me about now kind of part of that?
3:00:13
Yes.
3:00:15
Do you want to continue a little bit more talking about that?
3:00:17
Well, I think what we’re seeing is that
3:00:23
we’ve got to figure out
3:00:27
two things.
3:00:28
We’ve got to challenge this notion that no activity has no effect, or it
3:00:34
looks like you can’t do something in the plantations; that we’re not having
3:00:39
an effect, but we are having an effect.
3:00:42
It’s going to be a challenge, and how do we deal with that
3:00:44
from a regulatory perspective?
3:00:48
What it is someone is going to have to do?
3:00:50
And you have to think about if we are willing to take a short-term
3:00:56
potential negative effect for a long-term positive gain.
3:01:02
Then somebody has to make a decision and take responsibility for it.
3:01:06
Take the heat.
3:01:06
To take the heat.
3:01:07
Exactly.
3:01:08
Or, are you just going to say, we’re not going to do that.
3:01:14
Now, I think we’ll be able to start to have the discussion, and
3:01:16
when you say you’re not going to do that, that’s not no effect.
3:01:20
That is an effect.
3:01:26
[Inaction can have effects]
3:01:27
What has been the biggest surprise for you, first, from the aquatics,
3:01:32
portion [NWFP] , but also in general,
3:01:37
effects, good or bad, from what was expected or hoped
3:01:42
for with the original plan?
3:01:44
You can start with aquatics, but you can also reference old
3:01:47
growth and that kind of thing.
3:01:49
I think we’ve advanced
3:01:55
aquatic conservation strategies.
3:01:56
Norm [Johnson] said that of all the stuff which came out of the Northwest Forest
3:02:03
Plan, the Aquatic Conservation Strategy was probably the most innovative, creative
3:02:08
and effective thing that happened.
3:02:09
And it was totally new.
3:02:14
He felt it was the biggest thing.
3:02:16
But he doesn’t like to say that around Jerry because it
3:02:18
upsets Jerry, and he thinks they [aspects of NWFP] all sound good.
3:02:21
But, I’ll take it.
3:02:23
You don’t want to shake the guru, do you?
3:02:25
No, you don’t want to poke the old dog in the eye.
3:02:32
But the truth be told, I think it really is
3:02:37
[innovative] . But having said that,
3:02:44
it’s been implemented in a very protective way.
3:02:47
[Limits on activity, affecting innovation.]
3:02:51
The aquatic part?
3:02:53
Yes, the aquatic part.
3:02:56
There has been very limited activity in the Riparian Reserves, when there
3:03:00
was expected to be a fair amount.
3:03:04
There have been very few attempts to think
3:03:19
big or develop work to apply over a large area.
3:03:20
Which is still the paradigm of the Forest Service, BLM, and pretty much everybody?
3:03:25
Exactly.
3:03:25
We assume that by doing active management that we are not having an effect.
3:03:33
However, we often creating unintended affects that will be
3:03:37
expressed in the future [range of issues regarding ecosystems]
3:03:43
. Give me an example?
3:03:44
Well, again, you know, with fire suppression, we’re trying
3:03:49
to protect something, right?
3:03:50
Right.
3:03:51
Well, in many of our streams,
3:03:56
there’s a serious deficit of sediments.
3:03:59
Because there’s not enough erosion?
3:04:01
There’s not enough erosion.
3:04:03
And even when we have a fire, what’s the first thing we do?
3:04:07
Put it out.
3:04:07
We put it out.
3:04:07
But after a fire, the number one priority of the Forest Service is to stop erosion.
3:04:13
Do whatever you can to plant stuff?
3:04:15
Right, to stop erosion.
3:04:20
Okay, I understand, you’ve got the Clean Water Act, property and stuff,
3:04:27
but don’t do it under the guise of saying you’re protecting these stream
3:04:31
systems, because you’re actually not.
3:04:38
About the Clean Water Act,
3:04:42
how much better do streams of the Northwest fulfill
3:04:49
provisions of the Clean Water Act since twenty years ago?
3:04:52
Well, it’s probably better, but again, it’s coming at a price.
3:04:57
The Clean Water Act says every stream should
3:05:01
be drinkable, swimmable, wade-able, fishable, whatever-able,
3:05:07
whatever they call it.
3:05:08
It says every stream shall do this.
3:05:12
That never happened, it never will happen, and if it does, we’re in trouble.
3:05:19
Because?
3:05:20
We need this inherent variability.
3:05:22
[In aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems.]
3:05:24
Right.
3:05:26
If you look at the fish we’re trying to protect, they’re built for disturbance.
3:05:33
You look at them,
3:05:41
they’re nothing more than “weeds,” you know, aquatic weeds.
3:05:47
That is indicative of an evolving landscape that was very dynamic
3:05:51
and very unpredictable, and we’re trying to force them into a much
3:05:57
more stable, predictable landscape, and that’s just not going to happen.
3:06:02
It shows, I think, the limitations of even the best-laid human plans.
3:06:06
Exactly, exactly.
3:06:08
Mother nature is still boss, in other words.
3:06:10
Yeah, that’s right.
3:06:12
We’re just temporarily visiting here.
3:06:13
Yeah, yeah.
3:06:19
What would you say the biggest disappointment or shortcoming of the
3:06:22
plan was in terms of the plan itself, but also how it’s played out over time?
3:06:28
Stick again with aquatics, unless you want to make other comments.
3:06:32
If I could go back in time and change one thing in the plan, it would be to
3:06:37
not call the riparian reserves, “riparian reserves.” That completely sent the
3:06:42
wrong message. You know, we used the “R-word” and we never should have done it.
3:06:47
[Implied to many, preservation without active management]
3:06:47
Which means something like a park preserve?
3:06:49
Don’t touch.
3:06:51
Exactly, don’t touch.
3:06:51
And that was never what the intention was.
3:06:53
The intention was, let’s identify the outer boundary of the aquatic ecosystem,
3:06:57
and manage it in a very dynamic way.
3:07:00
Preserve made it sound like it’s a park.
3:07:01
Exactly.
3:07:03
Right.
3:07:03
That sent a message that these were really no-touch zones.
3:07:08
So, in part, the scientists are responsible for what’s happened.
3:07:12
I’m not trying to lay it all on the managers or the regulatory agencies.
3:07:17
We were in part responsible just because of the terms we used.
3:07:20
And I know why we did it.
3:07:24
We did it because
3:07:29
everybody was tired and we were losing our creativity.
3:07:33
We had been through
3:07:38
the Gang of Four, we’d been through SAT, we’d been through PACFISH,
3:07:44
INFISH, whatever else we did in between before we got to FEMAT.
3:07:48
We were trying to change the terms, but we didn’t come up with new terminology.
3:07:53
You
3:07:56
can only call a dog so many things, and then you run out of terms.
3:08:03
We did that.
3:08:08
We knew that was going to be an issue from day one, and we just didn’t deal
3:08:17
with it.
3:08:17
What do you think going forward, is going to happen?
3:08:22
We’re twenty years in, and that’s a generation.
3:08:27
It’s inculcated into the culture now, although there will be
3:08:31
more challenges because of the barred owl-spotted owl thing.
3:08:40
The Forest Service mentality has always been
3:08:46
to act more like a district, composed of many independent entities
3:08:49
not accustomed to being under the direction of a single plan.
3:08:49
Now that plans [forest/district levels] are
3:09:16
up for revision, it is not clear how the current plan [NWFP]
3:09:19
will be followed or modified.
3:09:20
What the political pressure will be like is unclear.
3:09:21
Under the Obama Administration, there was essentially benign
3:09:22
neglect of natural resource issues.
3:09:22
What happens under the new administration [Clinton or Trump – interview
3:09:22
during 2016 campaign] remains to be
3:09:27
seen.
3:09:28
And it certainly wasn’t on the Bush administration either.
3:09:30
Correct?
3:09:30
Well, it was low there.
3:09:31
You know, with
3:09:34
Obama, it’s just been benign neglect.
3:09:38
Bush was purposefully neglectful.
3:09:40
Yeah.
3:09:42
Now,
3:09:45
I don’t expect much to happen given how close we’re getting to the election.
3:09:52
But what will happen after the election will be interesting.
3:09:55
Is it going to be a high
3:10:00
priority if Hillary wins, and what would they do?
3:10:03
If Trump wins, you know, it’s just going right out the window.
3:10:07
It’ll be dead
3:10:12
before he’s sworn in.
3:10:15
So, you’re not sure what’s going to happen after the next election?
3:10:18
We’re kind of in a static period right now.
3:10:21
Is the Forest Service going to, in unison, continue with the Northwest
3:10:29
Forest Plan with some adjustments, or tinkering around the edges?
3:10:33
Or is everybody going to go their own way again, roll the dice, and the
3:10:38
Siuslaw does something different than the Umpqua, the Willamette, and who knows?
3:10:44
Yeah, it’ll be hard to change the momentum that’s been built, but clearly the timber
3:10:51
companies and the local communities, especially since the O&C lands aren’t
3:10:55
bringing in money anymore, they’re certainly looking at changing the paradigm
3:11:01
back to something more like it used to be.
3:11:03
Correct?
3:11:04
Yeah.
3:11:04
I think that, too.
3:11:05
But you know, the other thing is, science no longer holds sway like it
3:11:12
did twenty years ago, truth be told.
3:11:15
Denial of everything, really.
3:11:16
Facts are no longer important.
3:11:18
And in the National Forest system, I think if they can avoid using the
3:11:24
science, they’re going to do it.
3:11:27
Interesting.
3:11:29
Anyway, you want to talk a little bit about Jim Sedell on the record?
3:11:34
Other than Jimmy was one of the most wonderful people that I know.
3:11:41
Just for the sake of this introduction here, Jim, who was a leading person
3:11:48
in the Northwest Forest Plan, but also in many other areas in the
3:11:51
private and public sectors, passed away, how many, three years ago?
3:11:56
About three years.
3:11:57
Three years ago, of pancreatic cancer.
3:11:59
And Gordie and Jim were co-leaders on the aquatic portion of the FEMAT report in the
3:12:04
Northwest Forest Plan, and good friends.
3:12:05
So, anyway, talk about Jim a little bit.
3:12:07
Well, I
3:12:13
mean, what do you say?
3:12:14
I don’t even know what to say.
3:12:18
It will definitely go down as one of the highlights of my life,
3:12:22
having known and worked with Jim.
3:12:29
There was nobody else like him.
3:12:31
He was incredibly creative and energetic,
3:12:38
and just a kind, wonderful person.
3:12:43
We were talking the last time we got together before Jim passed, and
3:12:52
he said to me, “You the one person in this world I never got mad at.” I
3:12:58
said, “Wow.” And he said, “You knew
3:13:06
how to talk to me and respect me, and when we disagreed,
3:13:11
you just told me straight up.”
3:13:15
And I said,
3:13:20
“Well, Jimmy, I got mad at you once.” He said, “Yeah, I know.”
3:13:25
When you worked with somebody for twenty-five years, and you
3:13:28
think, he never got mad at you, and you got mad at him once?
3:13:34
Whoa!
3:13:34
That’s pretty special.
3:13:37
That’s really special.
3:13:39
When
3:13:45
we would be introduced, someone would ask me what I do.
3:13:50
And I’d say, “Well, I do everything that Jim Sedell says he’s going to do and
3:13:54
never does.” I mean, the guy was just
3:13:59
a creative genius. He just was thinking about stuff all the time,
3:14:06
challenging assumptions and paradigms.
3:14:11
But he wasn’t a good detail guy.
3:14:13
So, I think that is why we worked really well together.
3:14:19
I could come in and do the detail work.
3:14:20
You were the ying and the yang?
3:14:22
Yeah, exactly.
3:14:23
And
3:14:28
we just were able to do it.
3:14:31
How many ideas [aquatic-centered] in the Northwest Forest Plan, were
3:14:34
primarily or originally his ideas, or was it truly collaborative?
3:14:39
Or did he really drop the big ideas, and then you guys shaped them?
3:14:43
I’m not exaggerating--the whole foundation was developed in the car ride between
3:14:51
Corvallis and Portland on our way to the Gang of Four [Memorial Coliseum
3:14:54
meeting] . It just matured from there.
3:14:58
We had this conversation.
3:15:00
Okay, what’s going on?
3:15:03
How do we think this world works?
3:15:05
How do we take what we need, the difference between what we have
3:15:09
now and what we think we need, and how would we go about doing that?
3:15:13
So, we don’t think the riparian ecosystems are correctly identified.
3:15:18
How would we think about it?
3:15:20
Well, maybe we shouldn’t think about a distance, but maybe
3:15:23
something about function.
3:15:24
If we’re talking about function and the processes, what are we thinking?
3:15:28
And it was just this exchange; an idea from him, one from me, and
3:15:35
we just jotted these things down.
3:15:37
And then it sort of morphed and changed and was challenged in different ways.
3:15:45
It was just an iterative process of continually challenging
3:15:52
and not accepting anything.
3:15:54
And I think that was really important.
3:15:56
We’re not resting on laurels, but constantly changing everything.
3:16:01
In fact, we used to say that it would be totally surprising if
3:16:05
these ideas held up for very long.
3:16:09
So, twenty years is a success story?
3:16:11
Twenty years, yeah.
3:16:16
That’s because what you’re doing is just offering up an idea, and then,
3:16:23
people go out and test it, and hopefully
3:16:28
learn from those tests about what worked, what didn’t work,
3:16:31
and then offer up a new idea.
3:16:35
It’s not reasonable to think that your idea is not going to
3:16:39
be challenged at some point.
3:16:41
In fact, if they’re good ideas, they will be challenged.
3:16:46
Now, what role did he [Jim] have after the plan was actually created?
3:16:51
Well, Jimmy
3:16:54
went into more administrative roles.
3:16:57
He was director of research for the Forest Service back in D.C. He
3:17:01
became a director of the PSW [Pacific Southwest-California] Research Station.
3:17:05
But
3:17:08
we always stayed in touch.
3:17:10
We always talked,
3:17:15
sometimes every day for months.
3:17:18
For example, he’d call me up and say, I got this problem, what do you
3:17:22
think about X, or these other things?
3:17:23
Or I’d call him up and say, Jimmy,
3:17:28
I’m thinking about this, what do you think?
3:17:31
What is your spin on it, or how do we talk about it?
3:17:35
We just continually went back-and-forth on those types of things, all the time.
3:17:42
Was he your best friend?
3:17:44
He was one of my best friends.
3:17:45
He was one of my best friends.
3:17:50
Tough, huh?
3:17:51
Yeah, it was,
3:17:55
it was a shock, you know, but—
3:17:59
It’s hard to see big personalities go away like that prematurely.
3:18:02
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3:18:05
Well, I have to tell you, you know, like having that discussion.
3:18:08
What was really interesting is we both were sad, but we weren’t scared.
3:18:15
You know?
3:18:18
You mean, when he was getting ready to die?
3:18:19
Yeah,
3:18:22
and we talked about it.
3:18:23
It was like, wow, Jimmy, just amazing.
3:18:28
It was absolutely amazing what we did together.
3:18:31
And not only what we did together, but how we did it and how much fun we had.
3:18:36
So, even amidst all this stress and pressure, it wasn’t like, ‘oh, my God,
3:18:41
the sky is falling,’ it’s like, ‘we’re going to get through this kind of thing.’
3:18:44
Yeah, “Eye of the tiger,” he used to say. “Eye of the tiger.” I remember we
3:18:49
were down in Port Orford one time to deal with something, we had to meet with the
3:18:55
folks on the Siskiyou about something.
3:19:00
We were watching one of the Rocky movies and they played the music for
3:19:03
“Eye of the Tiger,” and that became sort of Jimmy’s whole thing, “Okay,
3:19:08
eye of the tiger, man, suck it up.
3:19:09
We’re going to go do this.”
3:19:10
Too bad it couldn’t have been a better movie.
3:19:12
Yeah.
3:19:12
Well, the first one was great.
3:19:14
The first one was great, then it went downhill from there.
3:19:16
Yeah, they’re still making them.
3:19:17
Oh, yeah.
3:19:18
Now, he’s [Stallone/Rocky] coming back as a trainer to
3:19:20
train the son of Apollo Creed.
3:19:23
Yeah,
3:19:25
okay.
3:19:25
Anyway, we’re getting close.
3:19:27
[End of Audio, Part]
3:19:27
[Start of Audio, Part]
3:19:27
We are on File two of the interview with Gordon Reeves and Samuel Schmieding.
3:19:33
We’re just finishing up here, but we ran out of space on the previous file.
3:19:37
So, we’re now commencing a new digital file to make sure we finish this
3:19:41
and don’t get cut off mid-sentence, mid-paragraph, or mid-thought.
3:19:45
Anyway, you were talking a little bit more about Jim?
3:19:48
Yeah, I mean, it was just incredible,
3:19:56
how fortunate I was to meet up with Jim, and to just work with him.
3:20:03
Did you have a nickname for him, or nicknames?
3:20:05
Oh, well, no.
3:20:07
What was really funny, Ellen, his wife came up to me afterwards, after I
3:20:11
did a eulogy at his memorial service.
3:20:14
And you know, I used to call him Jimmy.
3:20:18
Well, you still do.
3:20:18
Jimmy or J.R.,
3:20:22
but my favorite was the “adrenal gland with eyes.” He was just
3:20:27
going all the time, you know, and we used to joke about it.
3:20:31
He was the adrenal gland with eyes.
3:20:33
He was an energetic dude, wasn’t he?
3:20:35
Oh, he totally was, yeah.
3:20:36
With a little bit of ADHD built in?
3:20:38
[Laughs]
3:20:38
Yeah.
3:20:41
And again, I think that’s why we worked well together, because we were
3:20:43
really, as you said, the ying and yang.
3:20:44
You’re a little more chilled than him.
3:20:46
Yeah, and there were several times I couldn’t keep up with
3:20:52
him on an intellectual level.
3:20:55
He was three steps ahead of me.
3:20:57
What was his background in terms of his training and reading?
3:21:01
He was a philosophy major as an undergraduate.
3:21:03
That’s what I thought.
3:21:04
Anyway, he went to grad school and went into aquatic ecology.
3:21:12
So, that’s where that came from.
3:21:13
Yeah, totally.
3:21:16
So, did he have a nickname for you?
3:21:19
Nope.
3:21:19
No, just Gordie?
3:21:21
That was it.
3:21:21
Just Gordie.
3:21:22
Cool.
3:21:23
What do you think the legacy of somebody like him should be?
3:21:26
A guy, who wasn’t like a company man with one agency where
3:21:30
he stayed his whole career.
3:21:31
He jumped all over the place.
3:21:33
Right, yeah.
3:21:33
What is the legacy of somebody like that?
3:21:43
Wow.
3:21:44
What would be Jimmy’s legacy?
3:21:45
And I’m asking you purposely.
3:21:48
No, I know, I know.
3:21:49
Because you knew him so well, and I intended on doing this in this interview.
3:21:51
Yeah,
3:21:54
I’m just trying to think about what or how I would even say, and it’s hard.
3:22:04
He was a real facilitator.
3:22:07
And if I looked back at Jim, that is what I would say he was really about.
3:22:13
He was a guy who made people think, and to think differently,
3:22:18
and creatively to push the
3:22:24
envelope.
3:22:25
As a result, there were some really innovative things in
3:22:28
the Northwest Forest Plan.
3:22:30
He was really the pusher behind the stream continuum [River
3:22:39
Continuum Project] . If you want a leader
3:22:44
who
3:22:46
has some charisma, can excite people and get them motivated, it was Jimmy.
3:22:56
If you wanted a leader who was going to pay attention to the details, forget
3:22:59
it, that wasn’t what he was all about.
3:23:01
So, sometimes he could be frustrating to work with because
3:23:03
he didn’t finish certain things?
3:23:06
Well,
3:23:10
that drove some people nuts.
3:23:12
And my thing was, get over it.
3:23:16
Look at what he did, and if you want it finished, finish
3:23:20
it.
3:23:21
He gave you the
3:23:24
idea.
3:23:26
That’s what he does.
3:23:27
Well, why didn’t he do this?
3:23:28
That’s not Jim.
3:23:30
He gave you the idea, and he’s already three projects down the road from that.
3:23:40
Well, thank you for sharing that.
3:23:43
Yeah.
3:23:43
What do you think the Northwest Forest Plan got wrong, and were
3:23:48
some of the things were that have made it difficult to implement,
3:23:52
especially certain aspects of it.
3:23:54
I’ve heard the “Survey and Manage” policy being a big problem, but you know more
3:24:00
about it than me, so fill in some blanks.
3:24:01
Well, I think
3:24:04
we all recognized this.
3:24:05
When
3:24:09
asked to evaluate the various options, we said, “Look, you can’t
3:24:13
evaluate these options unless you consider the whole landscape.”
3:24:22
In many places, from an ecological perspective, it doesn’t matter
3:24:28
what happens on federal lands.
3:24:30
We could lock them up and things may not improve.
3:24:36
We
3:24:38
wanted to talk about that and bring that to the forefront,
3:24:43
but we were never able to.
3:24:50
But where we did that was in the CLAMS project, the Coastal Landscape
3:24:54
Analysis and Modeling Study.
3:24:57
Afterwards, when a bunch of us were
3:25:02
really concerned about the
3:25:09
absence of being able to do that.
3:25:11
And we initiated a ten-year study to do
3:25:21
it.
3:25:21
She’s saying, it’s hot in here,
3:25:27
I want the fan.
3:25:29
[Family dog in room]
3:25:29
Yeah.
3:25:29
Anyway, she’s panting.
3:25:30
[Break in audio.] But continue on, with maybe a critique or reassessment
3:25:33
of the plan and how it’s worked out?
3:25:36
Well, again, I think that—
3:25:38
Not just your area, but anything else.
3:25:40
I think in general,
3:25:42
it’s been successful.
3:25:44
You know, the unanticipated things, like the barred
3:25:50
owl.
3:25:50
It was just like, okay, who saw that coming?
3:25:55
[Laughs] And we didn’t think about climate change.
3:25:58
When you started, it [climate change] , was barely on the radar.
3:26:00
[Central in climate science, but not yet mainstreamed in
3:26:01
society/other disciplines.]
3:26:01
Right, right.
3:26:01
I mean, 1992 was the first big international meeting about it.
3:26:05
Yeah,
3:26:08
so one of the things is that, okay, well, maybe we didn’t get it right,
3:26:15
but we’ve preserved some options by not
3:26:20
going as fast at active management as we would have done otherwise.
3:26:26
And when you mean active management, you mean intensive silviculture?
3:26:29
Silviculure type of stuff, right.
3:26:31
So, we slowed it down, and basically, we’ve had a “time-out” for a while.
3:26:38
But this “time-out” also likely had
3:26:42
unintended consequences that will likely express themselves in the future.
3:26:50
So, it’s
3:27:01
been a success, but not without some downturns.
3:27:06
And we may not fully yet recognize either the extent of the successes
3:27:12
or the extent of the downsides.
3:27:16
Evidence on those outcomes are just starting to emerge.
3:27:20
What about the fact that the timber sales, especially in Matrix and
3:27:25
AMAs, have been far lower than expected, for a variety of reasons?
3:27:31
Well,
3:27:36
is that the Northwest Forest Plan’s fault, or is it,
3:27:43
for example, we assumed that there would be some sale of old-growth,
3:27:48
continued old-growth harvest,
3:27:51
to keep up the numbers, right?
3:27:57
Well, there’s no social license to cut big trees any more.
3:28:00
We didn’t see that coming.
3:28:03
What do you mean, social license?
3:28:04
[Cultural paradigm shift.]
3:28:04
Well, nobody.
3:28:05
It’s not acceptable?
3:28:06
It’s not acceptable.
3:28:07
Except in certain rural communities.
3:28:10
And even there, it’s not acceptable that much because
3:28:21
the mills can’t handle it.
3:28:23
Because they’ve already retrofitted their stuff?
3:28:25
Exactly.
3:28:26
Exactly.
3:28:26
So, a lot of it was premised, at least initially, upon harvesting some old
3:28:37
growth.
3:28:38
That didn’t happen.
3:28:39
And like the barred owl, we didn’t see that type of stuff happening.
3:28:43
Nature is a moving target.
3:28:45
Oh, yeah, totally, totally.
3:28:49
And like I said, we completely missed climate change.
3:28:53
Not missed it,
3:28:56
we didn’t deal with it.
3:28:56
Well, it just wasn’t one of the main issues.
3:28:58
It wasn’t one of the big issues, exactly.
3:29:00
At the time, you were focused with shorter-term stuff, really.
3:29:06
Those type of things, I think, is where
3:29:11
I think there’s a downside.
3:29:14
And that
3:29:18
wasn’t an intentional downside [low timber harvest numbers for example, spotted
3:29:19
owl/barred owl, etc.] , but it’s something that we’re going to have deal with as
3:29:22
this thing morphs and moves forward.
3:29:25
Now, how do you think climate change has affected stream temperatures in the
3:29:29
Northwest, or is it too soon to tell?
3:29:31
I think it’s too soon to tell.
3:29:36
We’ve been doing some stuff recently, and there’s a lot more variability in stream
3:29:41
temperatures out there within a given stream than we had fully appreciated.
3:29:45
We’re going to have to deal with variability and how aquatic
3:29:47
ecosystems behave, and the expressions of that variability.
3:29:48
This
3:29:57
is going to be something that we’ve got to think about, and then figure out
3:30:01
how you’d bring it in to management.
3:30:04
Now, if you were going to put this whole plan and process and aftermath in the
3:30:09
context of American history, environmental history, what would be a capstone
3:30:14
statement that you’d characterize it as?
3:30:20
It was really innovative and creative,
3:30:26
and it served its purpose, but it needs to change.
3:30:31
It needs to morph.
3:30:36
And with that, we sign off.
3:30:39
Okay.
3:30:42
Actually, Gordon, I really want to say one more thing.
3:30:45
Thank you very for spending this afternoon here in Corvallis with me for
3:30:49
this important oral history project.
3:30:53
We’re going to be interviewing a lot of other people, and it will provide a
3:30:56
really important retrospective on a very important policy document and event,
3:31:02
in American environmental history.
3:31:04
So, thank you.
3:31:05
You’re welcome.
