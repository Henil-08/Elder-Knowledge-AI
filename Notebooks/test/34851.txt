00:03
Good morning, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State University
00:08
College of Forestry and U.S. Forest Service, here in the home of Rolf
00:13
Anderson, retired U.S. Forest Service.
00:18
We are here today on May 15, 2014 in his Alvadore home, and we are going to
00:25
be doing an oral history interview that is part of the H.J. Andrews History
00:31
Project, which includes archival rescue and recovery, and creation
00:38
of a research collection from those records, as well as oral histories.
00:43
This is one of many oral histories we are doing with Forest Service people, OSU
00:50
researchers, and other people connected to the Andrews Forest, and related
00:55
land management and science issues.
00:58
Anyway, good morning, Rolf, how are you?
01:00
Hi, Samuel, yeah, I'm doing good.
01:02
All right, very good, excellent.
01:04
I always like to start these interviews off with a basic biographical question,
01:10
where you were born and raised, and then you can kind of go off with a
01:13
biographical sketch on your own terms.
01:17
Okay.
01:21
Well, I was born in Seattle, Washington,
01:27
1936.
01:27
Shortly thereafter, my parents moved to Washington, D.C., where
01:31
my dad worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of
01:39
Interior, and commercial fisheries.
01:42
So, I was raised in Washington, D.C., went up through high
01:46
school, and graduated in 1953
01:51
from Calvin Coolidge High School.
01:54
And from there, I went up to Pennsylvania and took forestry
01:59
at Penn State University.
02:01
At the time, it was Penn State College.
02:04
I spent five years there, was out of school for a period of time, and graduated
02:12
with a Bachelor's in Forestry in 1958.
02:20
Now, what was your childhood like, especially in relationship to the natural
02:24
world, whether you're talking about your early years in Washington, but even
02:29
after you went back to Washington, D.C.?
02:35
I had some relation to the natural world.
02:37
I had an older brother that was, he's a couple years older than me,
02:42
and we both were in the Boy Scouts.
02:45
As I recall, I started out in the Cub Scouts, then went up
02:49
through the Boy Scouts and up through the ranks to Eagle Scout.
02:55
And did some outdoor work there when we'd go on camping trips, and summer
03:05
excursions with the Scoutmaster.
03:07
So, I was involved with outdoor kinds of things.
03:11
Do you remember any specific place or experience that was impactful
03:16
or made a strong impression on you?
03:22
Probably not.
03:24
Not right now anyway.
03:25
We used to go camping down in Virginia, which I'm thinking back now, I don't
03:30
think I realized it at the time or thought about it, but I think it was the George
03:35
Washington National Forest, probably.
03:39
And those were good camping trips, but I don't recall
03:43
anything particularly impactful.
03:46
Now, was there a time before you entered university where you started
03:52
thinking about what you ended up doing later in your life, the life of a
03:57
forester, a park ranger, anything in that basic track, a professional track?
04:07
Maybe more on where I wanted to live.
04:10
My
04:12
dad's family was in the Seattle area, and my mom's family was in the Portland area.
04:21
Two or three times as I was in junior high and high school, we would take
04:27
summer trips out to visit those folks, and spend a good part of the summer
04:31
out in the Seattle or Portland area.
04:35
And I really enjoyed that.
04:36
I enjoyed the trips driving out and back.
04:39
We'd go through national parks and visit other kinds of similar areas.
04:46
So, I always wanted to live in the West.
04:49
That was my major goal is, when I get out of school, I
04:53
want to live on the West coast.
04:54
So, you liked the big geography of the West?
04:57
Right, that's a good way of putting it.
05:02
Big spaces.
05:03
Montana; I'd read a lot of novels with Montana and the Rockies as
05:11
the theme, and I enjoyed that.
05:14
Any of those national parks, in particular, make an impression
05:17
on the drives back and forth?
05:20
Well, the Grand Tetons always have been special to me with those
05:24
magnificent, jagged mountain peaks you just don't see anywhere else.
05:31
And, of course, Yellowstone
05:35
was always interesting.
05:39
Now, what do you remember your views on what would later
05:43
be called the environment?
05:45
It wasn't really a word that was in use like it became later, but do you remember
05:51
your views on that word and the term, and what it came to mean, “nature,”
05:55
shall we say, when you were younger?
05:58
I don't know that the term environment was even used back in those days.
06:04
But you'd use nature, that's why I used that word.
06:07
The major thing I remember is at that time, Weyerhaeuser Timber Company,
06:13
had full-page ads in magazines showing clear-cuts with bright
06:20
green, young-growth growing back, maybe a stump in the foreground,
06:25
and all these young trees around.
06:28
Then in the background, the forest, with a mixture of trees and clear-cuts.
06:34
Their message was they were managing the forest in a proper way, and
06:39
they were very attractive ads.
06:40
And this would have been the '40s?
06:45
Late '40s, early '50s, yeah.
06:49
They were basically selling the positive image of what we'd
06:55
call “Industrial Forestry”?
06:57
Of managing.
06:57
Managed Forestry.
06:58
Managing forests, and it was very attractive to a young kid.
07:01
You know, I thought, "Boy, that's gorgeous country. It makes sense.
07:07
I'd like to be part of that."
07:12
Now, because
07:18
you had this split childhood, how would you compare what you saw in
07:24
the East, and you mentioned Virginia, with what you remember or saw in the
07:30
Pacific Northwest, the Cascades and even the Rockies, because you're going
07:33
back and forth across the country?
07:35
Well, it was a matter of scale.
07:37
Everything was bigger in the West.
07:39
There are broader expanses, bigger mountains, larger forested areas, clean
07:48
rivers, big rivers, flowing blue water.
07:53
You didn't see a lot of that back East.
07:56
So, it was just less people.
07:58
It was just very, very attractive to me.
08:06
How do you think the location of your formative years, and
08:09
in your case, being bi-coastal, affected your views on ecology,
08:16
science, and a career in forestry?
08:18
I mean, you already mentioned big geography and things like that, but
08:21
going from the Northwest, the big nature, back to the center of politics.
08:27
Obviously, you were a young kid and intellectually developing, but how
08:31
do you think that bi-coastal dynamic affected what and how you learned
08:36
when you were at the university and professionalizing yourself, and
08:39
then, even as your career advanced?
08:44
Oh,
08:47
I don't know, that's a tough question.
08:47
I don't know that there was a lot of thought on my part in my high school years
08:55
about what was going on in the environment and ecology and that kind of thing.
09:01
I just kind of took life as it came, and then enjoyed doing the things
09:07
I did, enjoyed going out west.
09:11
Yeah, I
09:14
didn't do a lot of deep thinking in those days.
09:22
[Break in audio]
09:23
We're back on, yes.
09:25
Let me just add something that maybe relates to that last question, but
09:31
something that's always bothered me
09:35
deep into my career, actually, but started in high school.
09:38
Folks would say, "What do you want to do when you get out into the world?
09:43
You know, what's your goals?" And I didn't know what I wanted to do.
09:48
I always thought, "Well, God, there's lot of things going on now, but ten years
09:53
from now there's things going on that nobody's aware of right now. How can
09:57
I say this is what I want to do when I don't know all the options?" And early
10:03
on, I developed a philosophy, you know, I want to take advantage of whatever's
10:08
there at the time and grow in what I was doing, and be ready for the next step.
10:13
So, that was the extent of my deep thinking.
10:19
When you entered the university system, did you know you wanted to study forestry
10:24
and land management, or did that develop over your first year or two or three?
10:29
Well, you had to know initially, going to Penn State.
10:32
Their first, their freshman year for forestry students, was off-campus.
10:38
It was in a small, little town in southern Pennsylvania called Mont Alto.
10:43
And it was where there was a private forestry school started
10:47
in the early 1900's, and in the 1920's, it merged with Penn State.
10:53
And so, they used that as the introduction to forestry your freshman classes there.
11:00
We started out with close to a hundred students in the fall, and by June
11:09
when we finished that first year, we were probably down to sixty-something.
11:14
So, what did they do that first year, they'd get you out into the
11:17
field a lot, a lot of hands-on stuff?
11:19
Some hands-on.
11:21
Lots of, I think, we were like over twenty credits, or close to twenty credits per
11:29
term, and it seemed like we went to school from 8:00 to 5:00, and then had homework.
11:38
It was pretty intense.
11:39
And we had biology, chemistry, physics; outdoor practicums.
11:46
It sounds like a pretty-intense indoctrination into the university system?
11:49
It was.
11:51
And I guess, some of that was probably to weed out the folks that
11:55
weren't sure they wanted to do that.
11:57
But it was just focused on forestry.
12:01
Now, what do you remember about the forests of Pennsylvania, the
12:06
northern Appalachia, if you will, the Alleghenys or wherever you were.
12:10
How was that different?
12:12
Obviously a lot more hardwoods.
12:14
Many, many, many, many more species than you have out West.
12:18
All right.
12:19
I
12:22
really didn't think about that difference a lot at the time, but you know, we had
12:26
dendrology classes, and you had to learn trees and learn the Latin names of trees.
12:30
And after I got out west and taught the folks who'd gone to Oregon State,
12:34
I thought, "Holy mackerel, you guys had it easy in learning trees out here.
12:39
You just have a handful." And back there, dozens and dozens of trees.
12:45
So, and the trees weren't as big, of course.
12:51
Most of the logging was, a lot of it was situated towards pulpwood, growing
12:57
pulpwood, although there were some in there, black cherry and some of
13:01
the oaks and those hardwoods, were
13:05
for furniture and other lumber uses.
13:10
Now, what were some of your career and role models at that time as you
13:13
were developing in school, either in the university at Penn State, or even
13:20
people that you started reading about in the textbooks or public figures
13:25
in land management and the like?
13:31
Well, there was a fellow named Maurice Goddard, who had been
13:35
head of the Forestry School at Penn State for a number of years.
13:38
And by when I entered Penn State, he was the head of the, I forget
13:46
what they call it, but it was the Department of Resources for the state
13:50
[Pennsylvania] . He was always talked-up very positively by faculty, and he
14:00
came to the school several times.
14:01
And it was obvious that he was a very well-respected guy and deservedly so.
14:09
So, he was kind of a guy you looked at.
14:11
And then Gifford Pinchot was strong in Pennsylvania.
14:17
You know, his family was in the northeast part of the state.
14:21
He came back and was governor in the '30s after his Forest Service work.
14:25
So, that was another figure.
14:29
And then I think as part of our schoolwork, I don't remember exactly,
14:33
but I'm sure we read Breaking New Ground, Pinchot's initial autobiography
14:41
about his work with the Forest Service.
14:42
So, those were the influences.
14:46
Yeah, Pinchot is the indispensable icon of anybody that grew up in the Forest
14:51
Service, especially before the 1970's.
14:54
Right.
14:55
Before we started criticizing philosophies of an earlier era.
14:59
Yeah, which we're kind of cycling back to now in some ways.
15:05
How so?
15:06
Well, just in conservation in, let’s say, back starting in '70s, conservation was
15:14
starting to take on a negative connotation because it meant cutting trees.
15:19
And we're kind of getting back to that.
15:22
Well, you know, we need to do management of forests in a conservative way, in
15:28
order to have healthy stands of forests.
15:32
Yeah, I think the word conservation was almost a philosophical
15:40
semantical splitting of hairs there for a while, where even though conservation
15:44
in the early days included both utilitarian forestry and land management,
15:50
as well as preservation, and later on, preservation became environmentalism
15:55
and conservation became something looked at like you were talking about.
16:05
Now, what were the key management paradigms in forestry and land management
16:11
that you learned or embraced as a student?
16:15
Oh, like what, give me an example?
16:18
Well, obviously, there's multiple-use, and any of the Gifford Pinchot-isms
16:24
and the things that came out of what was, you know, central
16:29
ideology and beliefs and management practices in the Forest Service, but
16:33
anything else that came your way?
16:34
Yeah,
16:38
that's one of those questions that you probably really think of some
16:41
good answers a couple days from now.
16:45
But multiple-use.
16:49
I don't know that the School of Forestry at Penn State used multiple-use,
16:55
because that was kind of a Forest Service term.
16:58
But their focus was on managing the forest.
17:03
Right.
17:03
Managing, determining what products, variety of products, you could get
17:09
from the forest in active management.
17:13
And so that was a strong tenet and then, of course, in those days fire control
17:19
and fire management was a strong tenet.
17:23
So, there wasn't so much focus on recreation and the other uses
17:27
of the forest that became more important in the '50s and '60s,
17:32
you know, both in laws, but also in practices within the Forest Service?
17:36
Yeah,
17:39
at that time, Penn State had a separate school for wildlife
17:44
and fisheries biologists.
17:45
They weren't even melded after, some years after I graduated, they finally
17:50
melded those programs together.
17:52
But those were separate degree paths.
17:56
Right.
18:02
If you were going to state your program of study and the things you learned
18:06
at Penn State, looking back, how would you describe your general program of
18:13
study, subjects, and what you learned?
18:15
And maybe what you didn't learn, and would only learn when you became a professional?
18:19
Well, I wasn't a very good student, to be honest with you.
18:23
I got through.
18:28
But when I graduated, I just wanted to get to work.
18:32
I wanted to get out and do applied work.
18:35
And my parents, I remember them asking me, "Are you interested in graduate work?" No
18:41
way, that wasn't anywhere on my agenda.
18:43
I just wanted to do applied work out in the field.
18:51
I had a thought there, but I've kind of lost it now.
18:58
Thinking about the field of study and what I'd learned, and how I applied that.
19:03
It was a general field of study.
19:05
We had dendrology, silviculture, forest economics, all those kind of subjects, but
19:14
I had problems relating those to the real world and to application.
19:19
And like I think I said earlier, I was really focused on getting
19:26
out of school and working, doing things, making things happen.
19:31
And
19:34
things, you know, I think over time, things change.
19:36
It wasn't unique to my period or necessarily of coming out of school and
19:41
working, but there was change in looking at how you managed forests continuously.
19:47
And so, you had a basic background of what a forest is and what the
19:51
interrelationships are in a forest, but lots of on-the-job learning
19:57
and applying, and looking at new approaches and those kinds of things
20:02
has gone on through my whole career.
20:04
Obviously, didn't learn that till you left and got out in the field,
20:07
but in retrospect, what were some of the things that you didn't learn?
20:11
I didn't learn?
20:13
Yeah, that only the "life of hard knocks" or experience would teach you?
20:18
Well,
20:21
this is probably what you've heard a lot, dealing with the public, working with
20:28
people that don't necessarily agree with what you think your approach ought to be.
20:34
Trees don't talk back, right?
20:36
Right, working with the public and public speaking, that kind of thing.
20:40
Oh, I did take a speech course in school.
20:47
Dealing with people, those kind of things, I think is what really, the
20:52
Forest Service is really good at, short-term training sessions and
20:56
bringing you along in those things.
20:58
But we didn't get them at Penn State.
21:03
Can you think of any foundational pivotal experiences in the university aside
21:09
from just your classes and what you took that affected you as you went forward,
21:14
any specific interactions, hearing a famous speaker, a field trip, a special
21:20
summer program, something like that?
21:25
Probably not really.
21:27
Although the Mont Alto experience where you spent nine months with
21:34
60 to 80 people, close quarters, going, living with and going to
21:39
school with, was a unique experience.
21:42
And not just for me, it's you establish relationships there that
21:47
just stay with you through life.
21:50
And I went to a reunion, I guess, it was a fifty-year reunion a few
21:56
years ago, and some folks, I had kept contact with and knew as I matured.
22:03
Some, I hadn't seen since I left Penn State, but I recognized them
22:08
instantly and was able to sit down and talk with them like we had
22:14
been lifelong friends visiting.
22:18
So, that was a unique experience.
22:20
And then we had a summer camp one summer for a couple months up in northwestern
22:26
Pennsylvania that, where we actually did get out and surveyed a tract of land and
22:31
cruised it and made a management plan.
22:34
That was a worthwhile experience.
22:42
So, what thought did the term "forestry" illicit when you were young, and
22:48
then when you were a college student?
22:50
When you thought of forestry, how would you have thought about that?
22:55
Well, to be honest with you, I kind of backed into going
22:59
into forestry at Penn State.
23:03
It was the best alternative arrayed against others that I
23:07
definitely didn't want to do.
23:08
My brother went into engineering.
23:10
And I looked at what he was doing in school and I thought,
23:13
I just couldn't relate to that.
23:15
I just said, "Nah, there's no interest there in physics and
23:19
chemistry and those kind of things.
23:21
No interest." And in talking with my parents, they would say, "Well,
23:26
you know, you've had your Boy Scout experiences and you enjoyed those, maybe
23:31
you're interested in forestry?" I said, "Oh, okay." I can't think of anything
23:35
negative about that, let's give it a try.
23:38
And of course, I really grew to love it, the more I got deeper and deeper into it.
23:43
How much do you think you were affected by the advertising, the propaganda, the
23:50
presentation of the "noble forester." I mean, both the Park Service and the
23:57
Forest Service, at different times there were certain presentations to
24:01
the public of the forester or the park ranger working and doing good deeds.
24:06
Do you remember that?
24:08
You mentioned the Weyerhaeuser ad earlier, but I assume maybe you read an article
24:13
in some magazine or something like that?
24:17
You know,
24:20
that doesn't trigger anything when I was in high school or at Penn State.
24:25
Although, like I said earlier, I did like reading stories about the
24:33
fur trapper days of the West, and the developing of the West, and when
24:40
the Caucasians first moved into the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.
24:47
I really enjoyed reading about that and things related to that.
24:51
So, that was one thing that drove me wanting to get into the Pacific
24:56
Northwest or Rocky Mountains.
25:01
But as far as
25:04
the noble forest ranger, that didn't come on till I was actually
25:08
working for the Forest Service.
25:10
But you know what I'm talking about in terms of the advertising and the
25:13
propaganda about the nobility of these careers and the people doing this work?
25:19
Oh, yeah, I saw that.
25:21
I worked with some really great mentors that who had been in the Forest
25:26
Service, not in the very early days, but in the, dating back to the '30s.
25:33
And I really admired those folks.
25:35
They had a strong work ethic, strong environmental ethic.
25:41
They embodied that noble forest ranger.
25:44
But back in those days, there was also a real strong esprit de corps?
25:50
Oh, yeah.
25:51
Of the Forest Service.
25:52
I mean, it was quasi-military, but it was different than that.
25:56
It was a certain culture that was very strong, and very unified.
25:59
Well, that was strong all the way up through, I think, probably into the '90s.
26:06
And then there was a number of things that kind of
26:13
weakened and diluted that.
26:15
But in my early years in the Forest Service, that esprit
26:18
de corps was very strong.
26:22
Now, before we get into your professional life, I want to ask
26:26
you one more philosophical question.
26:28
How would you characterize your environmental ethic and philosophy at
26:33
this early stage in your career, let's say, as a college student, and then,
26:38
right into your early professional years?
26:43
I think I was, though I wouldn't describe it in these terms back in
26:46
those days, but it was environmentally
26:52
bent towards being careful how many trees you cut and where you're cutting them.
26:59
I think that was it overall, you know, to preserve the forests.
27:07
But counter to that, I remember driving through Yellowstone
27:12
Park on the way to a summer job.
27:13
I had two summer jobs out in the Northwest.
27:17
Driving through Yellowstone Park and seeing these forests
27:22
stacked with dead lodgepole pine.
27:25
You know, even back in those days; that was back in the late '50s.
27:32
It finally caught up to them with the great fires that we had back
27:36
in when was it, the '90s, I guess?
27:37
You're talking about the lodgepole?
27:39
Dead lodgepole.
27:40
That bunched together so tight?
27:42
Just fall over and it'd be waist-deep on the ground.
27:46
And I was thinking, just I remember thinking, "Man, what's going to
27:50
happen here?" What's the final outcome of all this dead, dry wood?
27:57
We found out in, what was it, 1988, with that big fire?
28:00
[Yellowstone Fire]
28:01
Yeah, I guess it was the late
28:04
'80s.
28:04
But, so that kind of clashed with my, I think, my overall philosophy
28:09
of being careful about cutting trees.
28:16
Okay.
28:17
Let's go on to your professional life.
28:21
How did you become a Forest Service person?
28:24
And where was that transition from college to Forest Service, was there
28:28
an internship or some kind of a summer job, or how did that happen?
28:34
Well, I had that drive to live in the Pacific Northwest,
28:41
a very, very strong drive.
28:43
And when I met my wife in college and we got married before I graduated, right
28:50
from the start, I said, "You know, if you hook up with me, we're moving west."
28:55
Where was your wife from?
28:57
Pittsburgh.
28:59
She was a Pennsylvania girl.
29:01
She was, but she said, "Fine, I want to, that's great with me."
29:06
[Break in audio]
29:08
Okay, continue.
29:09
We're talking about you meeting your wife and telling her
29:13
that you had to move out West?
29:15
Yeah.
29:16
But I forgot the basic question we were on?
29:19
Well, the basic question was, is how the transition happened, from your college
29:25
to the Forest Service, and what was the plan or the internship or the first job or
29:30
--? Well, that was the strong driver, to
29:37
move to the Pacific Northwest.
29:38
So, there weren't a lot of options there, there was big lumber companies
29:41
and there was the Forest Service.
29:44
My grades weren't very good until my last year, and so, I got married, I
29:51
settled down, and had really-good grades.
29:54
But I wasn't an attractive person to a potential employer.
30:02
I did do some interviews with the Pennsylvania State Department of Forestry,
30:09
or whatever they were called at the time, and took a test there, but I knew that
30:15
they weren't going to be looking at me.
30:17
I knew my fellow classmates.
30:19
And I knew how many people they were going to be looking at, maybe a dozen
30:24
or fifteen, and I just wasn't in that group, which didn't bother me
30:29
a lot because I wanted to go West.
30:31
You didn't want to be in academics, so you wanted to go out and
30:32
do something in the field?
30:33
Right.
30:34
And I'd worked two summers in the West.
30:36
I worked up on the Olympic Peninsula one summer for the Forest Service,
30:41
and I worked out of Roseburg one summer for the Forest Service.
30:45
So, I kind of knew that agency.
30:48
And so, I applied.
30:52
At that time, you filled out a Civil Service exam, which wasn't
30:57
really an exam, it was just a form with your qualifications on it.
31:04
And the first job offer I got was from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be
31:09
a forester out of Browning, Montana, on the east side of the northern
31:13
Rockies, on the Blackfeet Reservation.
31:18
And I thought about that a while, and I thought, you know,
31:26
we had a child right after we graduated in July, and I said, "You
31:32
know, I want to go West, but that's really pushing the envelope," in the
31:37
Northwest with, not a strong agency, and a really different culture.
31:44
And so, I waited a while, and then I got an offer from the Forest Service
31:49
for the Lewis & Clark National Forest in central Montana in a
31:55
little town, White Sulphur Springs.
31:57
But
32:00
I took that.
32:01
And what I benefited from at that point, that time, that was 1958,
32:07
the Forest Service was really starting to ramp up timber harvest.
32:11
It had been growing through the '50s with all the folks coming out of World War II,
32:18
the veterans that went to forestry school, and the demand nationally just to open up
32:26
the national forests, not only for timber, but for recreation purposes, to get roads
32:32
in the national forests and to harvest timber to feed the housing industry.
32:38
And so, there was, the boom was starting, and the Forest Service was
32:43
hiring folks, even folks with mediocre grades like me they took a chance on.
32:51
So, you were in, what was the town again?
32:55
White Sulphur Springs.
32:56
Now, White Sulphur Springs is close to Missoula or Helena?
32:59
No, Helena's
33:04
the largest big town, but Helena's probably an hour-and-a-half away.
33:09
It's [White Sulphur Springs] out on the open plains.
33:12
If you really look, you can see some trees from White Sulphur Springs.
33:17
But if you go over the ridge, then there's forest land, lots of lodgepole pine,
33:24
some larch and other kind of conifers.
33:27
And the Forest Service had sold a multi-year, large timber sale to
33:35
establish a mill in White Sulphur Springs.
33:39
It was a stud mill.
33:41
And so, that's why they were hiring foresters to help produce
33:47
the timber to feed that mill.
33:49
And what was your job description at that time?
33:53
Well, I was a “junior forester.” I was the first
33:58
extra forester that the district had ever had.
34:01
They had a district ranger, they had an assistant district
34:04
ranger, they had a couple of
34:10
not full-time technicians,
34:14
they had an office clerk, and that was about it.
34:18
And so, I was the forester hired to work on timber sales.
34:26
And what was your impressions of that place, the small town, but also
34:30
the area that you were managing?
34:33
Well, I loved small towns.
34:38
I don't like big towns.
34:40
I like the small-town atmosphere.
34:42
I liked the fact that you knew a lot of people.
34:45
We made good friends with a ranch owner, who invited us out for the
34:51
spring roundup where you branded calves and de-horned calves.
34:57
And that was really enjoyable, but it was tough living for a couple of folks
35:04
that had a less-than-a-year-old baby that had grown up in the East and they're
35:09
used to all the urban kind of things.
35:13
How did you deal with the winters?
35:15
The winters were tough.
35:18
The wind, you know, we were on the east side of the Rockies.
35:21
The wind blew all the time, blew and blew and blew.
35:28
Our young daughter
35:31
seemed to always have a cold or have some health problems.
35:36
And given
35:41
that, plus the Forest Service culture, to me, in Montana, was
35:46
very local, Montana-oriented.
35:49
They had two forestry schools in Montana.
35:52
In Bozeman and Missoula, right?
35:54
Bozeman and Missoula, Montana State and Montana.
35:59
And as folks from the regional office [Region] in Missoula
36:02
would come out and visit
36:06
the forest, and we had, there were three or four districts on
36:10
the Lewis & Clark that had hired, each had hired a new forester.
36:16
Most of the ones they had hired were from Montana or Montana State, and
36:20
as we got together and interacted and went to training sessions in
36:25
Missoula, it just looked to me like
36:30
the management regime in that region was really favoring local graduates.
36:37
I
36:39
mean, it wasn't that I didn’t feel welcome, I made some good friends there,
36:44
but I just thought, "You know, this is going to be a tough show." And I really
36:50
wanted to get out to the West Coast.
36:52
So, after a year, I resigned, and moved out to Eugene, looked
36:58
for a job, and I thought, "Well, maybe forestry isn't for me.
37:02
I want to get back, and history has always been a strong interest with
37:08
me." And I said, "Oh, maybe I'll get a Master’s in History at the University of
37:12
Oregon." So, when I came out, I came out in June and started looking for jobs.
37:20
Every place I looked for a job, a summer job, gave people my background,
37:26
they said, "Well, you need to go to the Forest Service to get a job."
37:32
Finally I said, "Well, okay."
37:33
So, you came to Eugene because of the University of Oregon, or just because you
37:37
thought it would be a cool place to live?
37:41
And because I wanted to live on the West Coast.
37:44
Okay.
37:45
So, I went into the local Forest Service office here in Eugene.
37:50
This was in June.
37:52
Actually, I came out a week in late spring before I had resigned in
37:58
Montana, because I wanted to make sure I had something to come to.
38:01
And I talked to a local guy in the Eugene office and he said, "Well,
38:06
they're hiring up at Oakridge.
38:08
Go up and talk to the Oakridge District Ranger." He set that up, and
38:14
I went up there, and the guy said, "Yeah, we need somebody this summer.
38:18
We'll hire you." So, I said, "Okay."
38:21
So, you had been unemployed, or you resigned for about a month or thereabouts?
38:28
Well, yeah, several weeks.
38:30
See, I had secured that summer job before I resigned in Montana.
38:34
Oh, okay.
38:36
So, then I went back to Montana and I talked to my ranger, and I
38:41
said, "You know, I just think I need to pursue other options and
38:45
I'm going to resign in early June."
38:49
But what did you learn that one year in Montana?
38:53
If you were going to say, that's what I learned during that one year,
38:57
other than the fact that all the graduates from Montana and Montana
39:01
State [universities] were peopling the Forest Service in that area?
39:04
Yeah, and that was an observation.
39:06
That didn't dwell in me a lot.
39:10
What happened during that year is, like I said, they hired, each district
39:15
hired a new, brand-new forester to work on timber sales, and then six months
39:19
into the year, they ran out of money.
39:23
So, they hired these foresters betting on the funding, but
39:28
the full funding didn't come.
39:29
And so, I worked through the winter, went out in the woods with the construction
39:37
crew and helped them build a bridge.
39:40
The carpenter came down from Great Falls, and we built a
39:44
garage for the district ranger.
39:46
I just did anything there was, and I felt kind of bad about it because
39:52
this lack of money, they had to pay me because I was a full-time person, and
39:57
that meant their less-than-full-time people were laid off earlier than
40:02
normal, because they had to pay me.
40:05
And I felt uncomfortable about that.
40:08
So, what did I learn?
40:09
I learned that life is different than you might expect and
40:14
you roll with the punches.
40:16
And if you don't like what you're doing, then you get up and do something else.
40:22
And that the “Big Sky Country” really is true to its name.
40:24
Big sky, right?
40:25
Oh, yeah.
40:26
I had some great times.
40:28
Back in those days, safety, I won't say it was ignored, but
40:34
it wasn't a real-strong issue.
40:36
And you would go out by yourself, and they'd say, "Go up here, you know, with
40:40
a chainsaw and cut some of the trees that have mistletoe in them and some of these
40:46
old clear-cuts." And you'd be out there working all by yourself with a chainsaw
40:50
and, nobody thought anything about it.
40:55
Well, you had to be hardy to live in eastern Montana in White Sulphur Springs.
41:01
And I like to think I was hardy.
41:04
I enjoyed that challenge.
41:05
But it was tough on my wife and tough on my kid.
41:10
So, you came here and applied for a position in the Lowell District.
41:14
Correct?
41:15
Oakridge.
41:15
Oakridge, excuse me.
41:16
It was a summer job.
41:18
Okay.
41:18
And so, I worked that summer and I was in charge of a survey crew surveying
41:23
the first proposed road into Waldo Lake.
41:27
Though, at that time, there were very few roads in the National Forests, very few
41:31
roads in the Willamette National Forest.
41:33
You had mainline roads up the main streams, and that was about it.
41:39
So, I was in-charge of a survey crew.
41:44
Then came fall, school started at the University of Oregon.
41:49
So, I said, "We're going through with the school thing." And my summer job ended.
41:55
We moved into Eugene, and I went to school for a few weeks and then that got me to
42:02
thinking, "Now, what am I going to do when I finish this schooling?" And I went
42:05
in and I talked to my advisor, and he said, "There ain't a whole lot a history
42:10
major can do." And I said, hum, this is going to take, and he said, I thought I
42:17
could do it in a year, and it turned out it was going to take more than a year.
42:23
And so, there were some more negatives stacking up, so I went back up to
42:26
Oakridge and talked to the ranger there.
42:31
And again, good fortune has followed me a lot through life.
42:38
They had hired a junior forester that summer, and he got drafted.
42:43
So, that fall, they were looking for a junior forester.
42:48
So, that was me.
42:49
I said, "Okay."
42:50
So, how did you avoid the selective service?
42:52
You weren't that old back then, either.
42:54
I had a kid.
42:55
Ah, I got you.
42:57
So, I came back, and said, "Okay." I liked the people I was working with,
43:02
had good friends among those folks.
43:04
They liked what I was doing.
43:06
They wanted me to come back.
43:07
So, you lived in Oakridge for a while?
43:09
So, we moved back to Oakridge and lived there for six years.
43:14
Now, this was the era when Oakridge and Westfir, the company
43:18
town, were really booming?
43:19
There was two mills there, Hines Lumber Company was in Westfir,
43:24
Pope & Talbot was in Oakridge.
43:26
And they both employed between mill-workers and woods-workers,
43:31
they both had woods-working crews where they logged their own timber,
43:35
probably 300 to 500 people each.
43:39
And Oakridge was a booming town.
43:42
It was a very prosperous town.
43:45
Were you there when the above-ground gas tank exploded?
43:52
Down in Willamette City?
43:55
Or somewhere right there in Oakridge.
43:59
Yeah.
44:00
Yeah?
44:00
Were you there when that happened?
44:01
Yeah, I was there.
44:02
I remember
44:05
we had a couple of Forest Service fire tankers there.
44:09
I wasn't working with them, but I was a spectator watching that burn, yeah.
44:15
I remember going with my family somewhere up into the mountains and we saw the
44:19
aftermath of that, like, it leveled half a city block or something, didn't it?
44:25
Yeah.
44:26
Right, I remember that.
44:27
But tell me more about your experiences there.
44:31
You were there how many years again?
44:32
Six years.
44:33
Six years.
44:33
I was there from '59 to I think, '66 probably, '65 or '66.
44:42
And tell me about it, it was a boom town.
44:44
I mean, Westfir, Oakridge, two big mills, it was the go-go era.
44:50
And what was the town like, but what was also the Forest Service culture
44:55
and your job like during that era?
44:59
Well, the town was very active, very positive.
45:03
There were good places to eat, and an active social life.
45:08
I joined the Junior Chamber of Commerce, so I made some good
45:13
community friends my age that weren't part of the Forest Service.
45:17
The Forest Service was a big part of the community.
45:19
They had at that time, three ranger districts there.
45:24
They had the Oakridge District, which took the North Fork and the
45:29
Middle Fork of the Willamette.
45:31
They had the Rigdon Ranger District, which was the Middle Fork of the Willamette.
45:37
Then they pared off for a short period of time, the Salt Creek District, which
45:42
included Salt Creek, Highway 58 and Hills Creek, the next drainage to the south.
45:49
That's where I worked.
45:50
I worked on the Salt Creek District from beginning to end.
45:53
It was only in existence for probably five or six years.
46:01
One day I came into the office after work, and they said, "Well, you don't
46:06
work here anymore. You work for the Rigdon District." Because they'd
46:09
dissolved the Salt Creek District.
46:11
And I had the same job, did the same things, but they
46:16
had done some consolidation.
46:18
Now, at that time, the Fall Creek Reservoir, had that been built yet?
46:24
Fall Creek, no.
46:24
Actually, they were just finishing the Hills Creek Reservoir.
46:27
And of course, Dexter and Lookout Point were before that.
46:31
They were built in the late '40s or early '50s.
46:36
When I first got to Oakridge, they were just completing the dam [Hills
46:41
Creek] , and clearing the area.
46:43
There was no filling up of the reservoir, but of course, within a year or
46:48
two, they did fill up the reservoir.
46:51
And my job, what they called pre-sale, getting timber sales, preparing them
46:58
to sell and contracts to be logged.
47:02
In other words, you would go out and do a rough assessment/inventory
47:07
of what was there?
47:08
Right.
47:09
And we would look for, of course, the most mature timber, the best
47:14
timber, and then some stands were what we called over-mature, where
47:18
the tops were starting to die.
47:20
They were old-growth trees.
47:23
And so, I said, "We need to harvest those" and clean that area up.
47:29
But what was really great about the job was, as I said earlier,
47:35
there wasn't much of a road system.
47:37
We were putting in the road system, miles and miles of road
47:43
off the main-haul highways.
47:45
And it was all walking and all foot.
47:48
So, you did a lot of survey work then?
47:50
I did a lot of cross-country, just looking at the country, trying to
47:55
figure out the best route for the road.
48:03
We would mark the route with a plastic flag.
48:06
You know, you'd see different colored plastic flags, and we went through
48:09
rolls and rolls of plastic flagging,
48:15
marking the route.
48:16
Then we did some surveys, but there were other crews, engineering
48:21
crews, that would come in as it got more and more sophisticated.
48:26
Initially, when I was running a survey crew, we had a compass that sat on
48:30
a pole, and you looked through it.
48:33
And they got into more sophisticated instruments over time.
48:37
But it was,
48:41
I don't want to say we were traveling in country that nobody's ever
48:44
seen before, but very few people.
48:47
We were really
48:47
-- It felt that way at times?
48:49
We were really, far, far off.
48:51
Sometimes, we'd hike for several hours just to get to the job.
48:57
Now, you said about the first road into Waldo Lake.
49:00
You were a part of that.
49:02
That's become kind of a cause célèbre of preservation [regarding rules about no
49:06
motors on lake] in the more modern era.
49:07
What do you remember about Waldo Lake, seeing it for the first time?
49:11
Oh, it was awesome.
49:13
Big lake.
49:13
We came into it from the south end.
49:15
And you'd look and it'd just, you'd heard a lot about Waldo Lake.
49:21
The lake was a major feature, even in those days, and not very accessible.
49:29
But it was impressive, yeah.
49:30
Now, have they ever allowed motorboats on that lake, or is that just a recent
49:35
fight over keeping them from coming back?
49:38
No, they did allow motorboats for a long time.
49:41
That's what I thought.
49:45
Tell me about the timber work that you did, a little bit more.
49:52
We had aerial photos and contour maps, and we had old survey records.
50:00
The land survey was conducted in this part of the country, probably
50:05
from the 1860's into the late 1800's.
50:10
There were some good records.
50:11
You're talking about the U.S.G.S.?
50:13
[United States Geological Survey]
50:14
U.S.G.S. So, we could read those records and get an idea of what the country was
50:18
like, and what the vegetation was like.
50:22
And of course, we had to reestablish all those section corners just to tie into
50:29
the road survey and those kind of things.
50:32
So,
50:35
we would look at the aerial photos and look at what looked like the best kind
50:41
of stands we would want to look at to harvest on a priority basis, look at
50:47
the contour maps to see how we might access those stands, and then go out
50:52
on the ground and see if that fit.
50:55
See if what we thought we could do in the office, fit on the ground.
50:59
And sometimes it did, and sometimes it didn't.
51:09
Okay, continue on about the timber sale work.
51:11
Well, a lot of the work was just working outside every day.
51:19
[Phone rings] Oh, I won't get it, but it's going to ring.
51:21
[Break in audio]
51:22
Back on.
51:24
Okay.
51:24
So, we worked outdoors.
51:27
Worked
51:30
with a crew of folks, identifying timber, putting boundary
51:36
signs up around clear-cuts.
51:38
The method of harvesting is clear-cutting.
51:43
Surveying the boundary.
51:45
Making or drawing up maps of the proposed timber sale, putting together
51:50
the timber sale contract; that
51:54
was the job.
51:55
In the fall, we would burn slash.
51:58
Everybody, no matter what their job was, we'd get together and
52:04
burn slash on logged-over units.
52:07
Everybody worked on fire.
52:09
If there was a fire, that was the top priority.
52:13
Locally, I worked in fire and was sent off the district to what at that
52:19
time, we called them project fires.
52:22
Now, I think they call them incidents.
52:24
Now, did you have any really-big fires that you had to deal with during
52:27
that time when you were at Oakridge?
52:30
Not on the forest, not at Oakridge.
52:33
But I did go over to some big fires in eastern Oregon and over in Idaho.
52:40
When was the Oxbow fire, which was just south of where you were, I believe?
52:44
Wasn't that in the Cottage Grove area?
52:46
No.
52:47
Oxbow was actually in the Coast Range.
52:49
Okay, my mistake.
52:51
North of Reedsport and south of Veneta.
52:54
Okay.
52:55
In that country.
52:57
I was in Oakridge at the time.
52:59
And at the time, it was all mostly on Bureau of Land Management land.
53:04
And I remember at the time thinking, "How could the Coast
53:07
Range have that big of a fire?"
53:10
Because of how much rain it got.
53:12
Correct?
53:12
Because of all the rain, yeah.
53:14
But then, as I became more knowledgeable about local conditions, that's
53:21
how the Coast Range burns, in big fires, big, catastrophic fires, as
53:27
opposed to the small, little fires.
53:29
And of course, going back to the classic fire in Oregon history, well, there
53:34
was more than one, but the Tillamook Burn [Several big fires in 1930s]
53:36
. Yeah, Tillamook, right, yeah.
53:36
And that was a Coast Range burn.
53:38
Right.
53:39
I was going to ask you when we were talking about Montana, and
53:41
now that we're talking about fire, but what do you remember
53:47
the memories of people, and how it affected the cultures about, what
53:52
they often called the "Big Blow-Up of 1910," which was big fires across the
53:58
upper Rocky Mountain states that really created the fire suppression culture
54:03
and policy of the Forest Service?
54:07
Yeah, I've done a lot of reading of Forest Service history.
54:10
And even back then, the fires of 1910 were part of the culture of the
54:15
Forest Service, and people talked about it and you read about it.
54:19
And then, the reading I've done in later years showed that every Forest
54:26
Service chief, but maybe one from 1d910
54:32
till deep into the 1930's, was in Region 1 and associated with that
54:39
1910 fire in one way or another.
54:42
So, it made a great impression on those folks and those that eventually
54:48
became chief, and that established our fire policy of fires needing to
54:53
be put out by 10:00 the next morning.
54:55
In other words, fire suppression at all costs?
54:57
Right.
54:58
And looking back at it through the lens of a full career and when beliefs started to
55:05
change about management, how can you see how that policy, actually, in many ways,
55:12
would come back to bite people later on?
55:17
Well, that was a one-solution-fits-all.
55:24
And that doesn't work very well in life and in a lot of ways.
55:29
So, the fact of putting the fire out early still has a lot of credence,
55:35
because the costs mushroom, the longer the fire goes on, the rate of the costs.
55:42
And they just,
55:47
grow exponentially, over time.
55:50
And so, it makes a lot of sense to put a fire out when it's small.
55:54
But also, that coincided with some really-wet years in the '40s and '50s and
56:04
'60s, so the forests had a lot of growth and a lot of flammable material produced,
56:12
at the same time we're putting fires out and not letting natural fires burn in
56:20
small ways, so they weren't catastrophic.
56:23
The fuel load built up, decade after decade.
56:26
The fuel load built up, and then fires became catastrophic just
56:30
because of the heavy fuel loads.
56:32
What's the first catastrophic fire you remember, that you actually
56:36
were more directly involved with?
56:38
You talked about the Oxbow, but maybe in a forest you were working in?
56:43
Yeah.
56:44
Anthony Lakes, which is a small ski area over in eastern Oregon in the
56:53
Wallowas east of, well, actually, I think it maybe is in the Whitmans.
56:58
It's in the Blues [group of mtn.
56:59
ranges in NE Oregon/SE Washington]
56:59
. It's in the Blues.
56:59
Right.
57:01
That was a major project fire.
57:03
I was sent over there, and that was the first big fire I'd been on.
57:08
I thought fighting fires was tough work.
57:11
It was, over there you're in that deep, pumice soil, and it gets, once you stir
57:17
it up and walk through it or dig a fire line through it, it's pumice dust and
57:23
dirt, and you've worked long hours.
57:28
You'd go back to the fire camp, and the fire camp was noisy 24-hours-a-day.
57:33
Generators running, crews coming and going, vehicles coming and going.
57:38
You couldn't get much rest.
57:40
You'd sleep from exhaustion?
57:42
The food wasn't great.
57:44
I mean,
57:47
still tough enough work [more recently] , but you know, now they
57:49
have showers, they have catered meals.
57:51
It's a whole different fire camp situation than when I was there.
57:56
Now, when you were a younger forester, did they cycle a lot of you guys into these
58:03
fire situations when you were still young?
58:06
Well, going to a fire was part of your job.
58:12
I mean, there was a fire organization, pumper crews and those kind of things,
58:19
but fires were staffed by just whoever was working on the ranger district.
58:23
So, age was not a consideration?
58:26
Not really.
58:27
Unless you were really, really old?
58:28
Right?
58:29
Yeah.
58:31
Back in the days at Anthony Lakes, when the Forest Service needed manpower,
58:39
they would take a big stake truck and drive the Portland backstreets.
58:46
And the winos,
58:50
at that time we didn't call them homeless,
58:55
they would just load them into the truck and say, "We got a fire," and probably
59:00
half of them would be good workers.
59:02
Half of them weren't.
59:05
This is a true story.
59:06
When I was at Anthony Lakes I'd come back off the fire, in the fire camp there'd
59:11
be a few folks sitting around, and they didn't even know where they were.
59:16
Because they'd just pull them off the streets?
59:16
They just pulled them off the streets.
59:19
But that was
59:20
-- But they paid them?
59:21
From 1910 on, that was
59:23
-- But they would pay them.
59:24
Right?
59:24
Oh yeah, they paid them.
59:25
That was the source of fire crews, going and finding the unemployed,
59:33
and taking them out to the fire.
59:33
So, the
59:36
professionalization of firefighting crews that you see now across the West,
59:42
for however many months a year those people that are like on-call, that was
59:47
the last 40 years maybe, or 30-40 years?
59:51
That started growing,
59:55
I worked over on the Malheur [National] Forest in the late '60s and early
1:00:01
'70s, and that was when they really started building separate organization
1:00:10
fire crews on a ranger district,
1:00:14
and they weren't looking to pull timber management people or engineering
1:00:19
people into fires near as much.
1:00:21
They were building their own organization.
1:00:25
What do you remember about science and the role it had in the Forest Service
1:00:31
and your specific work at that time?
1:00:38
We had access to specialists or scientists that generally worked in
1:00:47
the regional office in Portland; pest management, insect folks, silviculturists,
1:00:56
reforestation experts, those kind of folks.
1:00:59
If you needed help or consultation, you could generally get a hold of
1:01:03
somebody and they would come out on the district for a day and work with you.
1:01:08
But that was probably our major use of scientists.
1:01:15
Did you know of the PNW Station or the Andrews at that time in your early years?
1:01:23
Yeah, we did.
1:01:26
There was some interaction, but not a lot.
1:01:31
They were kind of two separate cultures.
1:01:35
The National Forest was a can-do production organization, had high targets
1:01:44
and timber-oriented in a lot of ways.
1:01:46
So we were producing, doing work on the ground.
1:01:50
The research folks were kind of looking out ahead, and had
1:01:54
different things driving them.
1:01:56
Was there
1:01:59
a competitive dynamic between the "pointy-head academics"
1:02:04
and the guys in the field?
1:02:06
Do you remember that kind of a thing?
1:02:10
No, I don't.
1:02:12
Not so much.
1:02:13
Probably there were some undertones there, but there were just different
1:02:19
cultures, different objectives, different things, driving the groups.
1:02:26
There'd be some interaction, like at Society of American Foresters’ meetings.
1:02:32
There'd be researchers
1:02:36
from the H.J. Andrews and Corvallis there.
1:02:39
And there'd be ranger district folks there.
1:02:42
But not a lot of interaction.
1:02:45
Speaking about the Andrews or any of the other experimental forests, and
1:02:48
there's obviously, Cascade Head, South Umpqua, Andrews; I'm thinking kind
1:02:52
of the triangulation of this area.
1:02:55
What do you remember knowing about those places and why they were
1:02:59
there, when you were an early career forester, in your first decade?
1:03:05
Well, probably my greater familiarity was with H.J. Andrews, and it was there
1:03:11
to test, initially they were testing different timber harvest regimes, size
1:03:16
of clear-cuts, and that kind of thing.
1:03:18
Then they kind of morphed into looking at riparian areas and managing around
1:03:26
streams, and the temperatures in streams that were affected by timber harvesting.
1:03:32
So, we knew that was going on.
1:03:34
And occasionally, folks from there, would at different get-togethers, share
1:03:41
what they were doing and talk about it.
1:03:43
But from my perspective where I was working, there wasn't a whole
1:03:48
lot of direct hands-on interaction.
1:03:52
There certainly would have been more on the Blue River Ranger District,
1:03:56
which housed the H.J. Andrews.
1:03:59
Tell me about your evolution from Oakridge.
1:04:03
You mentioned eastern Oregon and some other things.
1:04:06
Take me through the next couple stations, for instance, or postings.
1:04:11
Well, I was at Oakridge for six years, and then a job administering timber
1:04:20
sales, different from preparing them.
1:04:22
Once the contract was sold, then you had to make sure the contract
1:04:27
provisions were met by the logger.
1:04:29
And I'd never got into that, and a job, that kind of a job came
1:04:34
open at Sweet Home and I put in for it, and then got that job.
1:04:38
So, I worked there a couple years, but I had to do that.
1:04:42
I had to go out of the Forest Service.
1:04:48
This is a Civil Service classification.
1:04:50
I had to be a forestry technician, because that's the way the job was set up.
1:04:55
And that really made the Forest Supervisor Dave Gibney, uncomfortable that here
1:05:00
was a guy with a college degree, a forester, working in a non-forester job.
1:05:09
So, after a couple years, a forestry job heading up timber management on the
1:05:15
Detroit Ranger District east of Salem came open, and he put me in that job.
1:05:20
He said, "Now, you've got to go back to being a forester." So, I took
1:05:25
that job and was there a few years, and then went over to Burns as the
1:05:33
timber management assistant, the head timber guy working
1:05:38
for the district ranger.
1:05:40
I did that for, we were there six or seven years in Burns, and I loved it over there.
1:05:47
I loved the job, loved what I was doing, but I started to look ahead
1:05:51
and say, "You know, am I going to love this ten years from now, or should I
1:05:55
start looking at maybe doing something different with my career?" And I started
1:06:00
looking at what the options were.
1:06:02
And you were still a forester?
1:06:04
I was a forester.
1:06:05
You were doing basically the same thing in a different location, more experience,
1:06:09
but still basically the same thing?
1:06:11
Yeah, and I was in-charge of everything in timber management, from preparing sales,
1:06:18
to selling sales, to administering sales, to reforestation after the sales, to
1:06:24
pre-commercial thinning of young growth.
1:06:28
And I had a staff of people working for me.
1:06:32
Obviously, the ecology is much different east of the Cascades, but describe the
1:06:37
difference between western slope Cascades, high desert, you know, the mountains
1:06:43
around Burns, that kind of thing?
1:06:44
Well, the trees are different.
1:06:46
The predominant trees in the Cascades are Douglas-fir,
1:06:50
western hemlock, and true firs.
1:06:53
On the east side, it's lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, some
1:06:58
true firs, but not a lot.
1:07:02
And the cutting regimes are different.
1:07:06
A lot of ponderosa pine responded more to intermediate cutting, rather than
1:07:15
cutting everything in clear-cut mode.
1:07:18
The ponderosa pine didn't need near the sunlight the
1:07:21
Douglas-firs need to regenerate.
1:07:24
So, it was just partial cutting.
1:07:28
Marking trees, which I always thought was crazy; you had spray paint on every
1:07:33
tree you wanted to cut, and I'd come from a culture in the Cascades where
1:07:38
you put a line around 100 acres of trees, and cut everything within it.
1:07:44
Here we were putting a spot of paint on every tree we wanted to cut.
1:07:49
I kept looking for ways to do that differently.
1:07:55
But that was a difference in timber management.
1:07:57
Now, Burns was then territory of the Hines Company.
1:08:02
Yeah, Hines Lumber Company had a big mill [in Hines, next to Burns]
1:08:05
. And didn't they actually come over and take over the Westfir operation later
1:08:08
on, or one of those in the Oakridge area?
1:08:14
Yeah, I think the Hines mill was the first Hines operation in Oregon.
1:08:20
They were a Midwest company.
1:08:22
And they got one of those sales similar to what I was working with in
1:08:27
Montana, a multi-year 30 or 50 million
1:08:35
board-feet, I do not remember [exact number] , to be cut
1:08:37
over a long period of time.
1:08:39
So, they were well-established in the Blue Mountains in the Burns area.
1:08:45
They had the logging railroad that went up to Seneca.
1:08:48
It
1:08:50
was the largest indoor mill in the world, I think, at one time, they said at Hines.
1:08:57
[Near Burns]
1:08:57
Now, the ear of the Forest Service was more easily available
1:09:03
to industry at that time.
1:09:06
And you're going to tell me later as you got into planning and other things,
1:09:11
when the public, however you want to characterize that, in the post-NEPA,
1:09:15
environmental age, started to come to be.
1:09:18
What was the relationship in Oakridge, Sweet Home, Detroit, Burns, in those
1:09:26
early days before the environmental lobby became more established and strong, and
1:09:34
knew how to work within these laws, back when it was just you [Forest Service] and
1:09:41
the companies [timber] , and their needs?
1:09:43
Would that be a fair way to characterize it?
1:09:46
Yeah.
1:09:49
The Forest Service was well-respected in those small communities,
1:09:53
for a number of reasons.
1:09:55
There was good folks working that participated in the community
1:10:01
and a lot of community affairs.
1:10:04
Their spouses, which at the time were women,
1:10:09
were school teachers and did things, worked in the community.
1:10:14
So there was a very close relationship with the community.
1:10:18
Our job out in the woods was opening up the national forests for recreation.
1:10:25
I mean, when you put in roads for timber management, then anybody uses the road.
1:10:30
And you could go, you could hunt, you could access streams
1:10:33
for fishing, you could camp, and we were building campgrounds.
1:10:37
And so, it was a very positive relationship.
1:10:42
Numerous times, I would maybe be at a public meeting or
1:10:48
an information-sharing kind of session, and folks would come and say, "Well,
1:10:51
I really like what you're doing, I've always liked the Forest Service." Or, "I
1:10:55
worked summers when I was in high school for you guys." Very, very positive.
1:11:00
The same way over in Burns.
1:11:03
The timber industry
1:11:06
approach was, "Why do you need to involve the public in your planning? We've got
1:11:12
scientists and professional foresters; we know what to do, we just need to
1:11:17
go out and do it." Early on in the '50s, lots of times, industry foresters
1:11:25
would help in timber sale layouts.
1:11:28
They would, before the Forest Service staffed up, industry foresters would
1:11:34
actually say; "We'll help you. We'll help you identify the stands of timber.
1:11:37
We'll help you put boundaries around them." That came to a halt because
1:11:45
there were conflicts of interest
1:11:48
there.
1:11:48
Aside from environmental issues, there were economic conflicts of interest, too?
1:11:55
Yeah, because these timber companies would then bid on the timber.
1:12:01
So, do you remember when you were in your early career as a forester, but
1:12:07
before you evolved into what you would do later in your career and even before
1:12:12
the environmental ethos would shift everything in the public mind, did you
1:12:17
ever think about when you were laying out a sale, you'd say, "I don't know about
1:12:23
this place," or "We're cutting too much too fast, or we have too many roads." Did
1:12:29
you start internally reflecting on that?
1:12:31
Oh, yeah.
1:12:32
I think most of the people on the ground felt the great pressure to produce
1:12:39
timber, and really thought we were probably pushing too hard to do that.
1:12:47
I remember a couple of instances.
1:12:52
One was pretty early in my career.
1:12:55
We were laying out a timber sale up along a long ridge up in the Oakridge area.
1:13:10
There was
1:13:12
a series of high-elevation lakes along there.
1:13:16
And the road, they weren't cutting timber right up to the edge of the lakes, but
1:13:21
the road went fairly close to some of the lakes where I had positioned the road.
1:13:27
One of the fellows working for me was there for a summer job, but he was taking
1:13:31
forestry back at Michigan State, I think.
1:13:37
He asked me about it, "Shouldn't we not be putting a road so close to these lakes?
1:13:43
Aren't they pristine, and we want to preserve them?" My answer at the time
1:13:49
was, "Well, we've got a number of these areas throughout the ranger district,
1:13:54
and some of them we are staying away from, and some of them we aren't.
1:13:57
It's just we're not into preserving everything.
1:14:01
We're just trying to kind of do a mix." And,
1:14:08
God dang it, and I just.
1:14:09
. . . . I had another thought there, too.
1:14:13
Let me, yeah, turn that off for a second.
1:14:14
[Break in audio]
1:14:15
Well, another realization that I had at the end of our National Forest
1:14:21
Management Act planning cycle.
1:14:23
When our plan actually came out, our timber harvest on the Willamette
1:14:27
[National] Forest was cut in half.
1:14:29
This was in the '80s?
1:14:31
This is in the late '80s.
1:14:34
Right.
1:14:35
Right.
1:14:35
Yeah, the '80s.
1:14:37
We knew that was coming because
1:14:43
our projected harvest was skewed.
1:14:47
We
1:14:50
asked, "How could that happen?" You talked about in the early days, were
1:14:55
we aware of special areas, and we were.
1:14:58
Most cases, we would go around those areas.
1:15:04
Locally, the ranger and local ranger district folks knew those were special
1:15:09
areas and that we were never going to go in there and harvest timber.
1:15:13
But they were never taken out of the base for which we calculated how much
1:15:19
timber we should be harvesting annually.
1:15:22
We were actually harvesting timber at a greater rate than we
1:15:26
-- Of the other areas?
1:15:28
Right.
1:15:29
And it was a greater rate than we would ever accomplish.
1:15:31
But we never drew lines around those areas and formally recognized
1:15:37
them until the National Forest Management Act planning process.
1:15:41
And that was after 1976.
1:15:44
Correct?
1:15:44
Yes, that was in the '80s.
1:15:46
Then we created special interest areas, special botanical areas,
1:15:52
special tree-growth areas.
1:15:56
Then we put lines around all those areas that in the back of the
1:16:01
ranger's mind, we would never go into.
1:16:04
Now, you were in another district, but not too far away.
1:16:09
Do you recall the French Pete controversy?
1:16:11
Oh, yeah.
1:16:13
I mean, you could kind of say that was the precursor of what was to come.
1:16:18
Yeah.
1:16:18
And what do you remember about that, and the impression it made
1:16:23
on you or even the culture of the Forest Service here in Oregon?
1:16:28
At the time I was on the ground.
1:16:32
They called us "ground pounders." That was going on, but it
1:16:37
wasn't going on in my district.
1:16:40
It was something to be aware of.
1:16:44
And the Forest Service, we just dragged our feet, resisted any kind
1:16:50
of meaningful dialogue or discussion about not harvesting in that area.
1:16:58
And so, I was just aware of it.
1:17:03
The most local thing I remember is our ranger, one of our
1:17:08
rangers at the time in Oakridge,
1:17:13
was thinking, well, that's what he was paid for, to think
1:17:17
farther ahead than we were.
1:17:20
He said, "You know, this French Pete business is going to continue to escalate,
1:17:26
and we need to put roads around our current wilderness areas. We need to put
1:17:33
roads along the boundaries of current wilderness areas so that they won't be
1:17:39
expanded." Because it won't be a preserve.
1:17:43
In other words, a preemptive strike, so to speak?
1:17:46
Right.
1:17:46
And we did that in several areas.
1:17:50
Do you remember
1:17:54
after some disturbance event, a flood, whatever, where you maybe saw
1:18:00
ecological impacts, the watershed, the erosional effects of too much
1:18:04
cutting, creating problems with the water flow or the runoff?
1:18:12
You know, I don't recall that.
1:18:15
But you do remember the 1964 flood.
1:18:18
I certainly remember roads slumping out, putting timber sales
1:18:24
or roads in slumpy areas, and certainly a lot of that happening.
1:18:31
But I just at the time, I said, "Well, you know, that's just part of what happens."
1:18:38
Now, you were in Oakridge during the 1964 Christmas flood.
1:18:41
Correct?
1:18:41
Oh, yeah.
1:18:43
What do you remember what it did in that area, specifically your district?
1:18:52
Initially, we would have winter storms, heavy winter storms.
1:18:57
The district folks would go out into the forest and try to make sure culverts
1:19:03
weren't plugged and that kind of thing.
1:19:05
So, I was out with a guy up Hills Creek.
1:19:08
And man, we pretty soon realized this wasn't just a heavy winter storm.
1:19:16
There were trees coming down.
1:19:19
You couldn't hear yourself think with the boulders being
1:19:23
pushed down Hills Creek itself.
1:19:28
We turned around and came home, as did everybody else who was
1:19:32
out in the woods at that time.
1:19:34
It was a major catastrophic event.
1:19:37
There was lots of
1:19:41
fallen trees down in the water courses.
1:19:44
So, we had timber sales in those, clearing those out.
1:19:50
A lot of salvage work after that?
1:19:52
Yeah.
1:19:53
Lots of salvage timber sales.
1:19:56
As far as thinking, well, our timber harvesting practices
1:20:02
helped accelerate that
1:20:03
-- I'm not talking directly about that flood.
1:20:08
I'm just talking about, in general, reflecting about, why I had asked you
1:20:13
about sell, sell, sell, and you start reflecting about adding to it the
1:20:18
dynamics of erosion and water runoff?
1:20:21
Yeah.
1:20:24
I don't think I thought a lot about the incremental erosion.
1:20:29
It was more on a landscape scale as, you know, this drainage is prone to
1:20:35
very slumpy ground, and so maybe we don't want to put a road in there.
1:20:39
We want to see if we can helicopter log and that kind of thing.
1:20:44
Now, going back to an even earlier disturbance which affected the Coast
1:20:48
Range more, but you were also in Oakridge during the Columbus Day Storm.
1:20:53
Did you have a significant amount of blow-down in your district?
1:20:56
Yeah, we did.
1:20:57
We had our share, and as I recall it
1:21:04
again took salvage sales to open the roads.
1:21:08
And then there were large areas where just patches of timber came down.
1:21:13
That got us thinking about the edge effect, where you lay out a clear-cut
1:21:19
sale to see how it might produce an edge of standing timber that was very
1:21:24
vulnerable to wind coming up the ridge on the other side, that kind of thing.
1:21:28
I was thinking about that some.
1:21:32
Going back to where you were, I think to segue into your career
1:21:36
transition, and then I asked you a series of questions here.
1:21:41
You were over in Burns, and you started to think about, do I want to continue doing
1:21:47
this specific task in the Forest Service?
1:21:50
So, kind of take me to that process and how you became what you transformed into?
1:21:57
Well, it was several steps.
1:21:59
But I was looking at, started looking at jobs outside the Forest
1:22:04
Service, and I really didn't see anything very attractive.
1:22:08
But, I came to the realization that I would be unhappy spending
1:22:13
the rest of my career in Burns.
1:22:16
And just laying out timber sales, too?
1:22:17
And just working in timber, yeah.
1:22:19
Right.
1:22:20
And at the time, my district ranger, one day he came in and said, "Hey, here's a
1:22:26
one-year, they call it a fellowship, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
1:22:33
in General Management." He said, "You ought to, from what I know, you fit that.
1:22:40
You ought to put in for that." And again, my philosophy is, I did not
1:22:45
know what I'm going to do as I grow up.
1:22:45
You still don't know?
1:22:45
I'm going to
1:22:49
look for the next opportunity.
1:22:51
And this was an opportunity.
1:22:53
So, you went back to Massachusetts?
1:22:55
I applied for it and got accepted, and was at MIT for a year with fellows,
1:23:02
people, mostly industry people, and others from foreign countries.
1:23:09
It was quite an experience.
1:23:12
I took the whole family.
1:23:13
We lived back there a year.
1:23:14
That's very ironic that you describe yourself as a struggling college student
1:23:19
for much of your academic career, and then you go back to "Brainiac Grand Central?"
1:23:24
[Massachusetts Institute of Technology.]
1:23:24
Well, you know, that's right.
1:23:27
That's exactly right.
1:23:28
I had no interest in going to any more schooling until I went
1:23:34
back there, and I loved it.
1:23:36
That must have been fascinating, though.
1:23:37
I enjoyed it very much.
1:23:39
I had just grown up.
1:23:41
I was a different person, looking at academics differently.
1:23:46
You're back at MIT.
1:23:49
You're at MIT!
1:23:51
So, I go through the year at MIT and graduate.
1:23:54
And we had several field trips from, and seminars.
1:24:00
I had the chief come up and talk at one of the seminars we had at MIT.
1:24:06
And we went down to Washington, D.C. on a week-long field trip, and part of
1:24:12
that was visiting the Forest Service.
1:24:14
And so, when I graduated, the Washington office folks said, "Man, we've invested
1:24:21
in this training, and you need to work in the Washington office."
1:24:26
So, you returned to where you lived when you were much younger then?
1:24:30
That was not my response.
1:24:32
You know, I've spent 18 years in Washington, D.C., and I'm a West
1:24:36
Coast guy, and I don't want to work in the Washington office.
1:24:42
Did they make you stay anyway for a while?
1:24:43
Well, it was touch-and-go for a while.
1:24:46
And then, right before
1:24:50
I graduated MIT, Dale Robertson, who was the future chief [Forest Service] , was
1:24:57
the supervisor of the Siuslaw National Forest, and he'd had some kind of
1:25:02
one-year training, schooling after he worked for the Forest Service awhile.
1:25:08
He kind of knew what I had done, and it was a very positive experience for him.
1:25:13
And he was aware what I went through.
1:25:14
And a job, the job of
1:25:18
the Dunes Ranger for the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area out of Reedsport,
1:25:24
was open, and he offered me that.
1:25:26
And I said, "Yeah, man."
1:25:29
But now, you were a ranger, but you also had this background
1:25:34
in management/planning.
1:25:36
Right?
1:25:36
Well, my whole Forest Service background up to that time was in timber management.
1:25:42
And then, I had this general management year-long session at
1:25:48
MIT that covered all the facets of just managing an organization.
1:25:53
Now, you came back in what year?
1:25:56
That was 1975.
1:25:58
So you're at Siuslaw now?
1:26:02
Yeah, and I went down there, and it was a total recreation job.
1:26:07
And the Dunes had just, in the formation of the Dunes, some of the
1:26:11
initial thinking was that it'd be part of the National Park Service.
1:26:16
Was it a National Seashore Recreation Area kind of a deal?
1:26:19
Well, it wasn't anything.
1:26:21
Oh, okay.
1:26:22
But it needed to be put under some kind of a special management regime.
1:26:28
The Park Service was very interested in it, but the local people to a
1:26:33
person said, "We don't want the Park Service here. We're used to dealing
1:26:36
with the Forest Service." It was part of the Siuslaw National Forest.
1:26:41
"We're used to dealing with the Siuslaw National Forest, and we
1:26:44
want to keep dealing with them." So, eventually, it was designated as
1:26:51
a “National Recreation Area,” Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.
1:26:58
So, I went down there, and one of the first days I was there, the
1:27:03
publisher/editor of the Florence newspaper came in, and wanted to interview me, and
1:27:11
he'd been one of the strong proponents for keeping it in the Forest Service.
1:27:15
One of the first questions he asked was, "What's your background?"
1:27:19
Then the second question he asked was, "We heard your background
1:27:23
is totally in timber management.
1:27:25
Why are you here managing a recreation area?" And fortunately, a thought came
1:27:31
into my head at that time, and I said, "Yeah, that is my background, but I
1:27:37
just finished a year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in intensive
1:27:43
management training, and we've got a lot of great folks working for me that
1:27:48
know the ins and outs of recreation.
1:27:50
My job is to manage them." And that, he took that answer okay.
1:27:55
Good answer.
1:27:56
Yeah, I thought, I was pretty-proud of myself for thinking about that.
1:28:00
You didn't want to end up with an awkward quote your first month on the job.
1:28:04
Right?
1:28:04
Yeah.
1:28:06
So, I was there for just a year, a little over a year.
1:28:11
The job of program analyst opened up on the Willamette National Forest, out
1:28:18
of Eugene in the supervisor's office.
1:28:21
That wasn't super-attractive to me.
1:28:23
I loved working down on the Dunes.
1:28:27
But there were some family issues, and my wife was thinking it was time
1:28:33
to get into a more populated area, and she wanted to start working.
1:28:39
Our kids were in the latter stages of junior high and high school,
1:28:45
so she was looking to when they were going to leave the nest.
1:28:48
She wanted to have a career.
1:28:52
Her sister, whose husband had died in his early '30s and had three
1:28:57
kids, was living in Eugene, so things
1:29:02
were personally drawing us to Eugene.
1:29:04
And I thought, you know, she wasn't real keen on moving to eastern Oregon, and
1:29:09
we did, and we've lived in small towns.
1:29:12
Maybe it's time we made some tradeoffs there.
1:29:15
Move uptown?
1:29:17
And so, we moved into Eugene.
1:29:22
I felt bad about that professionally, because it's just not good for a
1:29:28
management unit to have a manager for a little over a year, and then change again.
1:29:34
Because you can't develop any continuity?
1:29:36
Right, yeah.
1:29:38
But I've kept contact with folks, they're having a reunion in September down there,
1:29:47
and they've invited me to the reunion.
1:29:48
So,
1:29:51
they even invite “carpetbaggers” to come back, right?
1:29:53
Yeah, that was kind of a carpetbagger deal.
1:29:56
So, I took that job in Eugene.
1:29:59
That was in '76, and in nineteen, I don't know, early '80s, my
1:30:06
boss who was head of long-range planning and program analysis moved.
1:30:15
I put in for his job, and got that.
1:30:20
That was Mike Kerrick, who was the forest supervisor [Willamette NF] . He
1:30:23
was my immediate supervisor and I was head of long-range planning, and that
1:30:28
was at the very initial stages of the National Forest Management Act planning.
1:30:32
And that was passed in '76, but would really come into implementation in
1:30:37
about the next five, six, seven years.
1:30:38
Right?
1:30:38
Yeah, right.
1:30:40
It was the early '80s before you really had the national
1:30:44
guidelines and the regional guidelines so that you could start.
1:30:48
Now, where was the forest headquarters at that time when you came over?
1:30:51
It was in the federal building
1:30:55
down there across from the Fifth Street [Public] Market.
1:30:57
When did it move over to the facilities it's at now?
1:31:00
Oh, they've only been there four or five years.
1:31:04
Oh, I thought it would have, probably been recent.
1:31:05
Yeah.
1:31:06
So, tell me about; you come into this job, things are changing,
1:31:11
Mike Kerrick's your boss.
1:31:12
What was on your plate?
1:31:15
What was on
1:31:21
the plate?
1:31:24
I had two responsibilities.
1:31:27
One was developing a Willamette National Forest Management Plan
1:31:32
under the guidelines of the National Forest Management Act.
1:31:35
Then also, working with, there were two acts actually in the
1:31:41
1970's that the Forest Service thought would solve everything.
1:31:46
The first was the Resource Planning Act, which was talked about long-range
1:31:51
planning and identifying your needs ten and fifteen years out.
1:31:55
The second was the National Forest Management Act, which talked about doing a
1:32:00
management plan for managing the resources on the forest for the next ten years.
1:32:06
Both of them, in hindsight, thought planning would be
1:32:11
the savior of everything.
1:32:12
All we got to do is make a plan, and then show that to
1:32:16
Congress, and they'll fund it.
1:32:18
Well, that it isn't how our politics work.
1:32:22
We spend millions and millions of dollars doing a Resource Planning Act plan and
1:32:29
doing a National Forest Management Act plan, and Congress could care less.
1:32:36
Didn't respond to them very well at all.
1:32:37
Now, during this whole time, the environmental age was coming of age,
1:32:42
or it was growing up from it’s early,
1:32:50
occasional outbursts to
1:32:55
-- Yeah.
1:32:55
To more grassroots, widespread activism.
1:32:59
Also important acts; Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and especially NEPA,
1:33:07
developed a whole new dynamic in terms of public involvement and management
1:33:13
of the natural resources, certainly on public lands, but broader than that.
1:33:19
And you're involved; your job was timber management and your family.
1:33:24
What do you remember seeing of the growing firestorm, and what was being
1:33:29
discussed within the offices and between colleagues about this developing thing,
1:33:34
and when did people really become aware that it was really different now?
1:33:40
Well, it was a mix.
1:33:42
As I remember, the environmental movement really started in the late '60s.
1:33:48
And that was, in conjunction with that, there was a number of
1:33:51
environmental legislations passed; the Wilderness Act, the Clean Rivers Act,
1:33:59
NEPA.
1:33:59
There was half a dozen laws that affected management of the forests.
1:34:05
And of course, with a large bureaucracy, it took a while for
1:34:10
that to sift down to on the ground.
1:34:13
You know, each level had to make their own interpretation
1:34:16
of the law and the guidelines.
1:34:19
We had national guidelines, and regional guidelines, and forest guidelines.
1:34:24
So, it was, and we had a mix of people.
1:34:26
We were starting to hire
1:34:30
what I call "ologists," you know, biologists, wildlife
1:34:31
biologists, plant folks,
1:34:40
archaeologists, those kind of different disciplines.
1:34:42
Up until that time, foresters just took that responsibility
1:34:47
on and did their self-training, or sometimes there'd be training
1:34:52
sessions about different sciences.
1:34:55
But now, we were hiring people that were trained in a
1:34:58
particular science, a specialist.
1:35:01
And we were starting to hire women at that time.
1:35:07
The whole picture was kind of changing.
1:35:09
And then, the National Forest Management Act talked about
1:35:16
managing in a specific way, identifying what you have out on
1:35:19
the ground, and really gave the environmental movement a spur.
1:35:25
I remember, I had a law class back at Massachusetts Institute of
1:35:30
Technology, MIT, and I wrote a paper on NEPA, which was pretty-fresh then.
1:35:37
And my work and research into similar kind of things, was the reason for writing the
1:35:47
paper, so we would learn how to research, do law research, and that kind of thing.
1:35:52
It became obvious to me that this work was only going to grow.
1:35:55
It started as well, you've just got to note what's out on the ground and what the
1:36:01
inner relationships are, and how you're addressing those in your proposed timber
1:36:06
sale, recreation campsite or whatever.
1:36:10
But it became obvious to me that it was going to be a tool that was
1:36:15
going to have to be more precise and more precise and more precise.
1:36:21
Eventually we would be writing environmental impact statements,
1:36:25
or something very close to them, on most projects.
1:36:28
You remember the early days when usually it was just an EA?
1:36:32
Right.
1:36:33
That was needed, which today, would be like a few pieces
1:36:39
of dust that would blow away?
1:36:40
[Environmental assessments were simpler & short]
1:36:40
Yeah, so we could see that coming down the road.
1:36:44
And things just started to get
1:36:49
more difficult, to get a job done [EA/EIS process]
1:36:51
. So, you're at the Willamette National Forest.
1:36:54
What were some of your first tasks, first jobs, first challenges?
1:37:00
You mean, when I moved there from Reedsport?
1:37:01
Yeah.
1:37:04
Like I said, for several years I was the program analyst, dealing with
1:37:09
putting together budgets and five-year budget planning and that kind of thing.
1:37:14
And identifying major projects we wanted to do, and doing it in a way that we could
1:37:21
secure funding for what we wanted to do.
1:37:23
Then I was promoted into the overall land management planning job,
1:37:29
and the first job there was just to assemble a team of planners.
1:37:37
Get the right folks.
1:37:40
That took a while.
1:37:41
We had some turnover, some folks just didn't quite fit.
1:37:47
But you also had to get a new generation regarding types of training and background
1:37:55
to do that kind of job, versus the old, classic forestry schools which turned
1:38:00
out people that did what you did for so many years, or for the most part?
1:38:04
Most of the planning team on the Willamette, and I think it
1:38:09
was pretty much the same on most national forests, were younger folks.
1:38:16
They were specialists; cartographers,
1:38:22
wildlife biologists, fishery biologists, plant botanists, those kind of folks,
1:38:31
that hadn't been in the agency very long and had different kinds of schooling.
1:38:39
Some of them were pretty idealistic about how they would be able to do their
1:38:45
job, and they did not have the long background indoctrination into the Forest
1:38:53
Service by working on a ranger district.
1:38:56
They were more committed to whatever their thing was, rather than the
1:38:59
service [U.S. Forest Service] . Right?
1:39:01
That was one of the real challenges, taking their specialty input and making
1:39:09
it so that it fit the overall picture.
1:39:12
Now, tell me about what you knew, or what your involvement was at
1:39:17
that time with the Andrews, when you came in the late '70s, early '80s?
1:39:21
And you knew about it from before, but the Andrews was changing, it was becoming
1:39:27
less of a standard experimental forest, you know, geared toward traditional
1:39:32
forestry practices, to more of a truly scientific, ecological research site.
1:39:37
What do you remember about your first interactions with the Andrews after
1:39:41
you came back and went into that job?
1:39:44
Well,
1:39:48
there were two different entities.
1:39:50
Two different cultures.
1:39:51
And you described that pretty well.
1:39:55
But they were evolving, driven by, they had some great leadership; Jerry
1:40:02
Franklin, Fred Swanson, Art McKee,
1:40:07
Stan
1:40:08
-- Gregory?
1:40:08
Stan Gregory, the stream guy.
1:40:11
He just retired, by the way.
1:40:18
They were great scientists, and they wanted to push that science envelope,
1:40:22
but they wanted it to be applicable.
1:40:25
They wanted it to make sense, and they wanted to see what they
1:40:28
were coming up with was applied.
1:40:33
We were the national forest, production-oriented, trying to get
1:40:37
things done on the ground, harder and harder to get done, realizing that
1:40:44
change was with us, and not only with the National Forest Management Act,
1:40:50
but with our public, and socially.
1:40:53
So, we both were kind of looking for, you know, how are we going to make this work?
1:41:01
Go on.
1:41:01
So, we were looking, we were both thinking, how are we
1:41:04
going to make this work?
1:41:05
And we've obviously got to be closer together, but we
1:41:10
weren't very close together.
1:41:13
I can remember we occasionally, we'd have get-togethers, and I
1:41:18
remember, and I've shared this with Fred [Swanson] several times.
1:41:23
We had a get-together, a joint Willamette rangers and management staff, and Jerry
1:41:30
Franklin and his guys, about something going on up the McKenzie, and it
1:41:35
culminated with a joint dinner at the Log Cabin Inn, which was an old, old inn.
1:41:41
It's up at McKenzie Bridge.
1:41:43
But hasn't it burned down?
1:41:44
It burned down, yeah.
1:41:46
In fact, every time I went in it, I made sure I was sitting pretty close
1:41:49
to the door because I thought it might burn down while I was there.
1:41:52
Why, because the kitchen was kind of
1:41:54
--? It was built in like the '20s, was just cluttered and all-wood, and dark.
1:42:00
But anyway, it was a standard meeting place because they had
1:42:04
a restaurant and room to meet, and they had different tables.
1:42:07
I remember we came in and sat down to eat dinner, and I started to look around.
1:42:14
I said, "Hmm." On this side of the room at four or five tables, was
1:42:18
the Willamette National Forest.
1:42:20
On that side of the room at four or five tables, was the H.J.
1:42:24
Andrews, and they were all talking amongst themselves, you know.
1:42:27
So, the two “tribes” were not mixing too much?
1:42:30
Still kind of arm's-length.
1:42:32
As I was looking at that, thinking about that, I looked at Fred Swanson,
1:42:41
and he was doing the same thing.
1:42:43
He got up and walked over and sat at our table,
1:42:50
and I thought, "Wow, that took guts!"
1:42:54
Sounds like a scene from one of those high school movies where the
1:42:58
jocks and the stoners, they don't want to sit next to each other.
1:43:01
And then somebody goes and sits with them.
1:43:03
Yeah, and that to me, was a significant event.
1:43:07
I think your memory is clouded by
1:43:14
age, but I think then, other folks moved around a little bit.
1:43:18
And that was, to me, the start of us really starting to integrate.
1:43:23
That's interesting, because Fred has become known for being a real
1:43:29
synthesizer and integrator as his career evolved in science, but also
1:43:35
as a manager and administrator.
1:43:36
Oh, yeah, yeah.
1:43:37
And just kind of a promoter of everything the Andrews was, has been,
1:43:43
and will be, but even beyond that.
1:43:45
Well, that was quintessential Fred.
1:43:47
That was Fred and how Fred is.
1:43:53
There was another example of this “coming together.” We really came together well,
1:43:59
but it wasn't like, okay, we've got the “national forest management plan, let's
1:44:03
get together.” Another incident that stuck with me was when we were identifying areas
1:44:12
to set aside from timber management, for spotted owls and pileated woodpeckers.
1:44:20
Our thought, the Willamette National Forest’s thought, was,
1:44:23
"Oh geez, this is going to take areas out of timber production.
1:44:28
Our targets probably aren't going to change from Congress
1:44:32
and the Washington office.
1:44:34
What are we going to do with these areas?"
1:44:38
We thought, and I'm kind of paraphrasing now, "The H.J.
1:44:41
Andrews is an experimental forest.
1:44:44
Let's load that baby up with these preserved areas." We started doing
1:44:49
that and pretty soon the phone rang, and Jerry Franklin says, "We've got to
1:44:54
talk to you guys." So, we had a small meeting there in Mike Kerrick's office
1:45:00
with Jerry Franklin and Mike and myself, and I think Jerry had some of his folks.
1:45:08
He said, "This isn't going to work.
1:45:11
If you fill H.J. Andrews with spotted owl and pileated woodpecker areas, we
1:45:17
can't do any research." And I said, "Oh, gee, I guess we didn't think about that."
1:45:26
There was no beating on each other, but it was just a realization that
1:45:31
we both have jobs to do here, and we need each other's help doing them.
1:45:37
To me, that was another step, one of coming together.
1:45:40
Now, speaking about the spotted owl, do you know Eric Forsman?
1:45:44
Oh, yeah.
1:45:45
And then, all of his progeny that followed.
1:45:51
Could you have ever guessed that his research early on, as a
1:45:56
graduate student when he started it, would have become what it became?
1:46:03
No, and that's a simple answer.
1:46:05
I mean, I didn't really think about it a lot at that time, but no, you couldn't.
1:46:10
You heard about the research, but then it became this thing
1:46:14
that developed a life of its own?
1:46:16
I doubt he even thought in those terms, at that time.
1:46:21
But yeah, so we grew together.
1:46:26
Fortunately, there was a string of really good rangers at Blue River; Jim Caswell,
1:46:35
Steve Eubanks followed Jim, and then Lynn Burditt.
1:46:38
They were all future thinkers, looking way ahead further than
1:46:45
probably the average ranger.
1:46:47
Jim Caswell ended up being Director of the Bureau of Land Management
1:46:51
before he retired, so he was, obviously, a sharp thinker.
1:46:57
They just made a relationship with the H.J. Andrews, and
1:47:01
they would push the envelope.
1:47:04
They would do timber management practices on the Blue River District,
1:47:10
implementing some of the thinking from the H.J. Andrews that kind of made the
1:47:16
rest of the forest feel uncomfortable.
1:47:18
You know, this is you're kind of going outside our standard guidelines here.
1:47:23
Enough of that “green” thinking.
1:47:25
Right?
1:47:25
Yeah, you know, and it was leaving more standing trees and clear-cuts, it was
1:47:32
leaving slash, big logs on the ground.
1:47:34
It was putting logs in the creek.
1:47:38
I mean, it isn't that the other rangers weren't thinking about that
1:47:41
or weren't messing around with it, but it was really happening at Blue
1:47:47
River, outside the H.J. Andrews.
1:47:50
And we would take field trips.
1:47:54
Then we could have dinner and sit at the same table together.
1:47:58
It was no longer, you didn't need Fred to go walk over and sit down?
1:48:01
Right.
1:48:02
We would have field trips and just talk about these things.
1:48:05
And that evolved into us asking Stan Gregory to develop the Riparian
1:48:12
Management Guidelines that we would use as part of our forest plan.
1:48:16
And this would be in the '80s as you are leading up to what it became
1:48:19
eventually, the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:48:21
Right?
1:48:21
Right.
1:48:23
And so, we really developed a good relationship, but it took time.
1:48:32
Jerry Franklin, the most famous of the scientists who came out of the Andrews;
1:48:39
he's still working, still doing his cone counts all over the Cascades.
1:48:45
What do you remember about Jerry, personality-wise, but also just all the
1:48:49
things he was doing, his energy, but also some of his really-key research areas that
1:48:55
impacted your management and planning?
1:48:59
Well, he was a driver.
1:49:01
He was a strong personality, very gregarious.
1:49:06
Could be very sharp at times, very political, but also knew
1:49:14
when to be sharp, and when to back off.
1:49:17
Although he would push that envelope, too, and
1:49:22
he developed a reputation, and some folks didn't like him very
1:49:24
well because of his persistence.
1:49:28
But he would take, I kind of looked at them as mini-sabbaticals.
1:49:33
He would take his crew of scientists on trips in the summer time.
1:49:37
And they would go off for two or three weeks.
1:49:39
They called them "pulses." [Held in Oregon, Washington, California.]
1:49:41
Right.
1:49:42
They would look at new things, but there was a whole lot of
1:49:48
interaction going on that whole time.
1:49:51
It was Jerry's way of developing consistent thinking, and
1:49:55
looking, trying to push, what's beyond the current problem.
1:49:59
What's the future?
1:50:02
That impressed me a lot.
1:50:07
We looked to those folks to develop a definition of old growth.
1:50:12
That was a real problem between timber management people and
1:50:17
environmentalists; each saying “old growth.” But really, what is old growth?
1:50:22
We didn't have a definition.
1:50:24
I've read in the literature, “old growth” used back in the '40s and '50s.
1:50:30
But it wasn't commonly used like it would be later, until much later.
1:50:35
What do you remember about hearing the term "old growth" in your schooling,
1:50:39
for instance, at Penn State, or even later when you first came out
1:50:42
West as a professional forester?
1:50:47
We've used the term forever.
1:50:48
I don't remember using it at Penn State.
1:50:51
We probably did, I just don't remember.
1:50:54
When you came out West and you're looking at old-growth Douglas-fir, the consistent
1:51:01
thinking with the Forest Service was these forests are “over-mature.” If the
1:51:07
tops are dying, it's time to harvest. You need to make use of this before it
1:51:14
rots and isn't of value to anybody for anything. But we never had a definition;
1:51:19
it was just “old stands.” When we got into National Forest Management
1:51:25
Act planning, we needed a definition.
1:51:28
We needed to be able to say this is an old-growth stand, or it isn't.
1:51:32
Just the fact it had big, old trees just wasn't enough.
1:51:36
But do you remember the time when old growth was looked at,
1:51:40
almost in a negative light?
1:51:41
Have you ever heard people say “biological deserts”?
1:51:44
Yeah, sure.
1:51:46
Do you remember that philosophy being present, and20-30 years
1:51:51
later, [whooshing sound] the whole thing gets flipped on its head?
1:51:54
Yeah, sure.
1:51:56
That was some of our highest priorities for harvesting timber,
1:52:02
the oldest stands, like I said, tops were dying and trees were falling over.
1:52:09
Now, what do you think about Jerry's promotion of the New Forestry?
1:52:16
And how do you interpret the New Forestry, at the time in the '80s
1:52:20
and early '90s when it was a cause célèbre, if you want to call it
1:52:27
that?
1:52:27
That was generated on the Andrews and concepts of it, is what the district
1:52:33
rangers at Blue River, like I was talking about, started to implement.
1:52:38
But again, that wasn't an easy transition, even for Jerry and his folks.
1:52:44
There were several different terms used, as he'd go one direction and another.
1:52:50
At one point-in-time, Jerry was proposing, rather than spotty, isolated
1:52:56
clear-cuts, you ought to clear-cut 1,000 acres at a time, and let it come back.
1:53:02
I mean, that was, he's clear-cutting the whole ecosystem.
1:53:05
The whole mountain.
1:53:06
Yeah, and then let it come back.
1:53:08
He was just
1:53:11
doing what good researchers do; looking at different hypotheses,
1:53:14
testing different approaches.
1:53:18
And again, trying to find the approach that you could implement on the
1:53:25
ground, politically and scientifically.
1:53:30
Now, when was the first time you visited the Andrews?
1:53:36
Actual location, the forest?
1:53:41
I probably did in my early years when I was working at Oakridge or Sweet
1:53:45
Home or Detroit, maybe on a field trip.
1:53:49
But when I visited it from a scientific viewpoint, probably late '70s.
1:54:00
And what do you remember about your first trip there and what you
1:54:03
saw, either in the landscape, the forest, but even the facilities,
1:54:08
which weren't much at that time?
1:54:09
Yeah, they didn't have hardly any facilities.
1:54:15
Probably one of my earliest visits was looking at the log decomposition
1:54:19
study where Jerry was looking at how logs, big logs, decomposed over time.
1:54:28
And he had even projected like a 200-year study, which was
1:54:32
-- That was Mark Harmon's study, actually.
1:54:34
Yeah, Mark Harmon did that one [Franklin was advisor]
1:54:35
. Jerry was still the lead guy up there, but that actually is Mark's.
1:54:41
Yeah, but that idea came out of Jerry, I'm sure.
1:54:46
And that just wasn't heard of at the time, a 200-year study, you know, who here
1:54:51
is going to be here 200 years from now?
1:54:54
So, that we would take, the forest managers, district rangers and
1:55:02
supervisor managers, supervisors, office managers, who would take
1:55:08
periodic field trips to see what those folks were doing and thinking about.
1:55:11
And the early trips were oriented around old growth and then, kind of also riparian
1:55:21
area management, those kinds of things.
1:55:24
What other people in science do you remember from the Andrews,
1:55:29
when you came back or started to be stationed at the Willamette?
1:55:35
There was Fred Swanson,
1:55:40
Stan Gregory, and Art McKee;
1:55:45
he was one of the
1:55:48
folks that interacted with National Forest maybe more than some of the others.
1:55:53
He was kind of a liaison [HJA Site Manager] . There was a guy;
1:55:58
do not recall his name, he was a silviculturist who ended up in Hawaii.
1:56:01
Vince Puleo?
1:56:01
No.
1:56:01
Vince was a Forest Service guy.
1:56:01
This was a researcher.
1:56:01
He was a strong environmentalist.
1:56:01
And he ended up going to Hawaii.
1:56:22
He was out there.
1:56:28
When you talk about Vince, the evolution of us coming together, the National
1:56:34
Forest and research folks coming together, actually it evolved into,
1:56:42
we established a liaison position
1:56:46
actually paid for by the National Forest system, working
1:56:50
at Blue River, John Cissel.
1:56:53
And actually doing studies on the Blue River Ranger District as part of
1:56:59
their timber program that implemented different ideas coming out of the
1:57:05
H.J. Andrews, like landscape scale management, looking at whole ecosystems.
1:57:13
Managing by fire regime, where history showed you had small, isolated fires
1:57:20
over time, many small ones as opposed to large area, periodic conflagrations.
1:57:27
And so, then we were really just meshed closely together.
1:57:32
Vince was a silviculturist on the Blue River District that was part of that.
1:57:40
Now, you mentioned John Cissel, and there's Cheryl Friesen there
1:57:46
now, somebody else I think was in before, or between the two.
1:57:50
But that's kind of a science liaison position that was created in part
1:57:55
because of the Andrews being there.
1:57:57
Correct?
1:57:58
Oh, yeah.
1:57:58
Or totally because of that?
1:58:00
Yeah, because the Andrews was there.
1:58:02
A lot of forests don't have a liaison officer like that because
1:58:07
there isn't a place like the Andrews within their purview.
1:58:10
Correct?
1:58:10
Right.
1:58:11
Right.
1:58:11
Yes.
1:58:12
They may have a liaison officer for a different reason, but it wouldn't be that.
1:58:16
Right.
1:58:17
Right.
1:58:17
This was doing on-the-ground implementation of research ideas.
1:58:23
Cheryl's very active in the whole dynamic there and is at all the Andrews meetings.
1:58:28
I met her, and you can see how that idea evolved from a
1:58:33
rudimentary idea and position into something that's very important.
1:58:40
Yeah.
1:58:46
Tell me about planning and how that changed.
1:58:50
You were at the Willamette until you retired then?
1:58:54
No.
1:58:54
After we published our National Forest Management Act plan,
1:59:00
which was late '80s, early '90s,
1:59:04
then we had to implement it.
1:59:07
I was there a year or two implementing the plan, and I'd had enough of planning.
1:59:14
I'd worked, spent the whole decade of the '80s planning, and I was just planned out.
1:59:22
I didn't want to go through another cycle of planning.
1:59:25
Again, I was of retirement age.
1:59:28
I could have retired and I was thinking about that, you know,
1:59:32
again like I was back like at Burns.
1:59:35
What are my options now?
1:59:37
What opportunities are out there?
1:59:40
And the district ranger at Sweet Home left.
1:59:48
My boss at the time then was Darrel Kenops, and I thank him greatly.
1:59:54
He came in and said, "Would you be interested in that job?" I thought about
2:00:00
it and said, “Hey, that's back out on a district which is where I was always
2:00:05
very, very comfortable implementing this plan I'd helped put together.
2:00:11
That sounds great.” And so, I went out there for five or six years as the ranger.
2:00:18
Of course, you were living in the house we're sitting at right now,
2:00:21
since you bought this shortly after you went to the Willamette.
2:00:25
Right.
2:00:25
You stayed in the same place, you just commuted differently?
2:00:28
Yeah.
2:00:28
It was an hour commute, but it was a great commute, driving.
2:00:32
I started driving I-5, and quickly got away from that.
2:00:36
There's some great backroads that got me there that were very enjoyable to drive.
2:00:43
And then, we went through a lot of stressful stuff, not only
2:00:48
implementing the forest plan, but reducing our organization.
2:00:53
Our budget was cut drastically and we went through what we call a reduction
2:00:58
in force, which is formally forcing people to move or quit, reassigning
2:01:05
people, bringing in brand-new people based on seniority kind of
2:01:12
considerations, which was very stressful.
2:01:15
But I found that hour commute was a great de-stresser.
2:01:20
At the beginning of the day, I could think about, okay, what do I need to be
2:01:26
geared up for going to work, and at the end of the day, I could kind of let go
2:01:30
of the stuff that was going on that day.
2:01:32
So, by the time I got home, I was de-stressed.
2:01:38
Now, I know you left planning, but I do want to talk about it
2:01:42
a little bit more before we go.
2:01:44
Tell me a little more about that decade, all the work, the
2:01:49
nuts-and-bolts, the grind it out, the public hearings, the whole thing that
2:01:54
became the plans that evolved into the forest plan of the early 1990's?
2:02:04
You know, I look back on that and think, "How could that have taken
2:02:08
that long?" I'm just bamboozled
2:02:14
that it took that long.
2:02:16
I somewhat jokingly, but not 100 percent, call it the "Lost Decade." We spent ten
2:02:24
years putting together a plan that, when I look back on it, it's incomprehensible.
2:02:32
But at the time, it was day-to-day.
2:02:35
You know, there was
2:02:38
pressure to get that plan out, and we went through several years of planning,
2:02:45
and then everything stopped because it wasn't coordinated well from the
2:02:50
regional office, and each forest was kind of doing their own thing.
2:02:54
So, we'd had a planning pause for about a year, in like '83
2:03:01
and '84, something like that.
2:03:02
And then we started over again.
2:03:04
We had the regional guidelines, and we had people coming and
2:03:09
going off the planning team.
2:03:11
Some people fit pretty-well, some didn't.
2:03:13
Some were brand new to the Forest Service, some were old-timers
2:03:18
that nobody else wanted.
2:03:19
It
2:03:23
was a management challenge, and it just went on year after year after year.
2:03:31
But we really weren't thinking in that terms, we were thinking, we've got to
2:03:36
meet these guidelines, we've got to get together, we've got to get it done.
2:03:42
When that was all done and I got out on the ranger district [Sweet Home]
2:03:45
, that's when I realized that plans are obsolete the minute you sign them.
2:03:53
I mean, they're still plans and they're still good thinking,
2:03:57
but you've got to evolve.
2:03:58
You've got to do that “adaptive management,” and see what in the
2:04:03
plan works, what doesn't, and if it doesn't work, you've got to change it.
2:04:09
The couple years I worked after our plan came out and I was still
2:04:13
in charge of planning, I looked for ways to, I'm searching for the
2:04:21
term now, adjust the plan, change the plan, where it wasn't working.
2:04:27
And I would ask districts, where isn't this working?
2:04:31
We want to go through a formal process to adjust the plan, to show that
2:04:36
it's not a document that's just cast in stone whether it works or not,
2:04:41
that it's a living document and we can keep current with activities.
2:04:45
And we were kind of successful in doing
2:04:51
that.
2:04:52
Now there is a popular tag, the "Forest Wars." [Political/cultural conflict
2:04:58
in NW over forest uses/planning in 1980s/1990s.] You were in
2:05:01
planning during that whole time.
2:05:04
How would you characterize this conflict?
2:05:08
We had a public information officer, Jerry Mason, who used
2:05:12
that term a lot- the Forest Wars.
2:05:15
And they certainly were there.
2:05:18
We had some really-tough interactions with industry people
2:05:26
and with environmentalists.
2:05:29
And there were folks across the whole spectrum.
2:05:35
Dyed-in-the-wool industry folks who said the only thing, we got to cut every
2:05:39
tree out there, and environmentalists said, we can't cut any tree out
2:05:43
there, to everything in-between.
2:05:45
And we just kept an open door.
2:05:47
We talked to them all.
2:05:49
And I became really-good friends with one of the industry reps, to the point
2:05:57
where he would come and tell me, "Now, in a couple days, industry is going
2:06:02
to do this," calling attention to something you're doing with planning.
2:06:07
I just wanted you to be aware, so it's not a surprise.
2:06:11
So, there was folks within industry we could talk with
2:06:14
a lot, and agree to disagree.
2:06:16
Other folks from industry, halfway through a meeting, they'd stand up and walk out.
2:06:23
Same with environmentalists.
2:06:25
We ended up asking one, they call it Oregon Wild now, but it was
2:06:30
Oregon Natural Resource Association.
2:06:33
Council, I believe.
2:06:35
They've changed their name three or four times.
2:06:37
We asked them to give us an alternative.
2:06:40
Give us what you think would be a viable alternative, and we'll
2:06:44
analyze it with the others.
2:06:47
They did, as I recall.
2:06:49
So again, we could
2:06:54
sit down and talk with
2:06:58
most of those folks.
2:07:00
But of course, we didn't always come to agreement, and most discussions were
2:07:09
profitable ones, not just yelling at each other.
2:07:12
And we would get Norm Johnson [noted forest planner] to come down and
2:07:16
talk to our management team a couple times a year, just to kind of get
2:07:22
his perception of what's going on.
2:07:24
He is OSU or Washington?
2:07:26
[OSU]
2:07:27
Norm Johnson developed the “Forplan,” which was a computer analysis tool
2:07:37
[modeling] to look at forest planning, and it didn't work very well.
2:07:40
We used it, but then we did make some adjustments and you
2:07:44
could make something out of
2:07:49
Forplan models, which is the way it should be.
2:07:52
You know, a model is a model.
2:07:53
It shouldn't dictate your decisions.
2:07:55
It should give you information to make a decision, to help make a decision.
2:08:00
But Norm was at the cutting-edge of planning things, and had his
2:08:07
finger, politically, in the pie.
2:08:10
He started out at Colorado State, and then, he's still at Oregon State.
2:08:16
He's like a Professor Emeritus now, I guess.
2:08:19
He was one of the “Gang of Four” that Clinton called
2:08:24
together, Jerry Franklin, and
2:08:28
the wildlife biologist guy that was chief [Jack Ward Thomas, and John
2:08:31
Gordon, Dean, Yale College of Forestry]
2:08:31
. Four men or
2:08:32
--? No, he went on to be chief.
2:08:36
[Thomas]
2:08:37
I'm drawing a blank.
2:08:39
Yeah, I'm terrible with names.
2:08:41
But there was four of them, and Norm Johnson was one of them.
2:08:46
He knew what was going on and was looking ahead.
2:08:50
So, we would have him come talk to us and alert us to whatever.
2:08:55
What about the local people, the local communities, and specifically the
2:09:00
local communities that come from the traditional extractive industries on
2:09:05
the land, not the second-home people that's developed up the McKenzie and
2:09:10
other places over time, or retired;
2:09:16
how were your relations with them during this period?
2:09:20
And how did that change, and not only did that, how did the reputation or the
2:09:26
feeling toward the Forest Service change?
2:09:31
Local leaders weren't very involved in the Willamette National Forest.
2:09:36
They knew it was there, they knew it was a big machine producing timber, but that
2:09:41
was about the extent of their involvement.
2:09:43
Early in the planning process, we got the idea to talk to those folks, and
2:09:50
asked, “What do you want to see out in the forest?” And we did have two
2:09:57
or three meetings, and all we got was, "Gee, I don't know, harvest timber."
2:10:03
So, we quit talking to them because they really hadn't thought about it.
2:10:08
The realization we came to, is that the attraction of the National Forest
2:10:13
to them was as an amenity if they were recruiting people to come to their
2:10:18
businesses because it was a great recreation area to go for recreation.
2:10:25
But what about the communities that were dependent on timber, though?
2:10:29
Of course, they wanted to keep harvesting timber.
2:10:34
There was no question there.
2:10:35
Although there were some environmental groups, particularly up out of Salem
2:10:41
and in the Breitenbush area, that were strong environmental advocates.
2:10:46
I remember going to a public meeting.
2:10:49
We didn't hold them, Norm Johnson was holding some meetings.
2:10:52
The Governor [Oregon] asked him to get involved in planning, so
2:10:55
he held some public meetings.
2:10:56
He held one in Lebanon.
2:10:58
I went to that and it was mostly populated by
2:11:05
folks whose families worked in the woods, either in mills or
2:11:09
in the woods itself, logging.
2:11:13
Those folks were just rabid about it; you got to keep this going!
2:11:18
Then I came to the realization, this is just like the auto industry in
2:11:25
the Midwest, where people had been doing this long enough that other
2:11:31
generations are working doing the same job that their parents did.
2:11:38
Or grandparents did.
2:11:38
And it's an expectation now.
2:11:42
In the '40s and '50s, it was a new opportunity, and a lot of
2:11:46
folks came from the South to work in the woods, from Arkansas and
2:11:50
Oklahoma and those kind of places.
2:11:52
And there's little enclaves of those folks still around.
2:11:55
But
2:11:57
then they worked, and then their kids worked, and then their grandkids
2:12:02
worked, and it became an expectation.
2:12:08
That’s the feedback we were getting, you know, “How can you change this? This
2:12:13
is something that's part of our life.”
2:12:15
Do you ever remember feeling disliked, disrespected, unsafe?
2:12:22
For instance, a lot of Park Service people in the Southwest when they were having
2:12:26
wilderness battles over BLM lands, they'd take their uniforms off as soon as they'd
2:12:30
leave the office because they were scared.
2:12:33
I
2:12:37
don't know how deep to get into that.
2:12:39
That's a whole different subject.
2:12:42
I've watched the Forest Service over time alienate themselves with
2:12:48
every support group we've had.
2:12:54
I don't remember any specific instances of physical violence.
2:13:03
There may have been some.
2:13:05
At this point-in-time, I don't remember that.
2:13:07
There certainly were folks that talked about feeling threatened,
2:13:14
primarily from the timber industry side where
2:13:22
the thought was we were taking jobs away from them, and they
2:13:25
got very angry about that.
2:13:27
And folks feeling uncomfortable wearing a Forest Service uniform, either out in
2:13:33
the woods or in the community after work going to the grocery store, or whatever.
2:13:39
We went through a decision process where all our vehicles were green.
2:13:49
What was the name of that green, was there a name for it?
2:13:52
Oh, I don't recall.
2:13:53
They just called it “Forest Service Green,” or was there a name for it?
2:13:56
Well, there was probably several names.
2:13:59
You still see that color around.
2:14:01
There's still some, but we went through a process
2:14:07
to get away from green rigs, and there was two reasons.
2:14:09
One was we had to repaint them when we resold them when we were done using them.
2:14:14
We had to repaint them, and that was a cost.
2:14:17
Also, they called attention to us.
2:14:23
I remember sitting in those decision meetings, thinking,
2:14:27
"That's our identification.
2:14:29
That's how people know us." They go up in the woods and they see a Forest Service
2:14:34
rig up and say, "Oh, my forest is being taken care of." Because they're up there.
2:14:40
But we didn't have that thinking then.
2:14:42
We wanted to get away from being recognized.
2:14:44
Now, they've got white rigs?
2:14:46
We’ve got white rigs, nobody recognizes us, and nobody supports us.
2:14:51
The only time you can recognize them is the ranger or law enforcement ones,
2:14:56
where they're got green stripes on them.
2:14:58
You can recognize that.
2:14:59
Oh yeah, they stand out.
2:15:01
When I went out to Sweet Home as the district ranger that was a
2:15:05
pretty tough community, because there was, probably at one time,
2:15:08
six or eight mills in Sweet Home.
2:15:10
There's only one or two left, right?
2:15:12
Right, maybe one.
2:15:16
So the town was pretty antagonistic.
2:15:20
I made it one of my priorities to get back integrated with the community.
2:15:27
I would wear my uniform, even though I didn't live in the community.
2:15:31
I would go into stores after work.
2:15:35
I joined the Sweet Home economic development group, and would go to those
2:15:43
meetings in my uniform, and I would encourage our folks to wear theirs and not
2:15:47
feel uncomfortable wearing their uniforms.
2:15:49
I
2:15:53
got a lot of support that way.
2:15:57
Over time, the community re-accepted
2:16:02
us.
2:16:02
They said, this is where we're going and we need to learn to deal with it.
2:16:06
Do you think that there's more of an acceptance now in rural Oregon or
2:16:13
the West about the changed calculus of how we manage our forest lands?
2:16:18
Well, there's a resigned acceptance.
2:16:22
Acceptance from the standpoint of I can't do anything about it.
2:16:25
This is going to happen.
2:16:28
Not acceptance from it's the right thing to do.
2:16:32
Particularly in southern Oregon, you see a lot of folks talking, as
2:16:36
there's still mills closing down there.
2:16:41
How many people, though, do you really think understand
2:16:44
the real reasons behind this?
2:16:47
Some of it certainly had to do with laws and culture changes, but a lot of it had
2:16:52
to do with world economics in terms of
2:16:59
where the jobs are going per se, not just things on the American public lands.
2:17:04
Well, that's right.
2:17:06
When I was at Sweet Home, I would talk to folks about the National
2:17:12
Forest reducing available timber, but at the same time, mills automating,
2:17:21
logging systems automating.
2:17:24
Industry
2:17:26
was cutting people, not only because there wasn't as much timber to harvest,
2:17:32
but because it was more economical.
2:17:34
That didn't get a lot of attention or acceptance, but
2:17:40
those things were happening.
2:17:41
And again, it depends on who you're talking to, somebody whose dad
2:17:47
and grandfather worked in a mill, and he doesn't have a job because
2:17:54
he thinks it's because we reduced the timber.
2:17:58
Or they blame the environmentalists?
2:17:59
Yeah.
2:18:02
With people, when they think about it and talk about it, and the different
2:18:06
factors come into play, there's resignation, but not really acceptance.
2:18:21
OSU and U.S. Forest Service co-administration of the Andrews
2:18:25
can today be held up as a model for effective inter-institutional
2:18:29
management and science.
2:18:30
However, that wasn't always the case based on many different reasons,
2:18:34
but this evolved into something that became very effective, and I
2:18:39
think remains very effective today.
2:18:41
But if you were going to characterize that relationship, as well as what
2:18:47
you want to say about the Andrews in general, what would you say about that?
2:18:55
Going to MIT helped because we worked a lot with technology transfer
2:19:03
issues, and a lot with modeling.
2:19:06
I'm not sure before I went to MIT, I knew what a model was when
2:19:11
industry talked about modeling, and we worked with that a lot.
2:19:16
After I went through the cycle of land management planning and was
2:19:22
out at Sweet Home, I looked back and said, "You know, the most impactful
2:19:31
and probably astounding thing that came out of that relationship with the
2:19:36
Willamette Forest and H.J. Andrews, is rapid technology transfer." We really
2:19:43
established a model for that that I don't know has been implemented to that
2:19:49
extent anywhere else in the country.
2:19:52
Explain the model.
2:19:53
Well, just the fact that you've got scientists with ideas, and they
2:19:59
integrate with the ground-pounders, the folks that are making it happen on the
2:20:05
ground, and they try different methods.
2:20:07
They do adaptive management, they share ideas, and the ideas then are
2:20:14
started to be implemented on the ground.
2:20:16
If they don't work, then you try something else.
2:20:19
It's just a very open give-and-take relationship that, again, took a number
2:20:25
of years to build, but man, it was very effective there in the late '80s and '90s.
2:20:32
And of course, that was at the very time when the Forest Wars,
2:20:37
the planning processes, were all at their peak intensity, and so it was a
2:20:42
necessary collaborative arrangement?
2:20:46
Well, it was a very fruitful one.
2:20:49
And
2:20:52
it was necessary, but being necessary doesn't always make it happen.
2:20:58
It happened with us in a very positive way, and a very fruitful way.
2:21:04
And it just worked.
2:21:06
Now, it seems to me, I know it's true that the Andrews and its forest
2:21:13
research and its overall ecological research, has affected management
2:21:20
and science far beyond the scope of the Willamette National Forest.
2:21:27
But in terms of the one-on-one relationship of a government entity,
2:21:32
a hybrid entity like the Andrews that is kind of between academics in
2:21:36
universities and the Forest Service and their scientists, it's a rarity to
2:21:41
have that dynamic, that effective, and that long-lasting of a relationship?
2:21:48
I agree with you.
2:21:50
I think it is, too.
2:21:52
We talked earlier about the roles of John Cissel and Cheryl Friesen, and
2:21:59
those are the folks that make it happen.
2:22:01
They go to the research meetings, they get the ideas, and they can share with
2:22:08
the research folks, "You would like to do this, but here's the reality of
2:22:14
problems with doing that. You know, and maybe if we did this, do it this way,
2:22:19
rather than that way, it would work more." So, we both profited greatly.
2:22:26
Research folks got to see their ideas implemented, and then, where they worked,
2:22:34
taken other places, and worked in other places, and we got the benefit from
2:22:40
cutting-edge research and awareness.
2:22:45
Anything else to say?
2:22:46
I think I'm running out.
2:22:48
I'll give you one more example, though, of us coming together with research.
2:22:56
Pretty far into the planning process, there was a group of environmentalists
2:23:02
led by a guy named George Atiyeh up at
2:23:08
Jawbone Flats, out of Mill City, which is a little piece of private
2:23:12
land and some good national forest, old-growth, surrounding it.
2:23:19
Again, this is one part of a long story.
2:23:22
But George Atiyeh wanted that whole area preserved.
2:23:27
Where is Jawbone Flats exactly?
2:23:31
You go up the Little North Fork out of
2:23:34
-- The Santiam?
2:23:35
The Santiam.
2:23:37
You go up from Salem east towards Detroit.
2:23:43
It's just a little east of Lyons before you get to Mill City.
2:23:49
You go off to the north, and
2:23:54
there's not great access to it.
2:23:57
But George Atiyeh brought together a group of environmentalists, and
2:24:01
he was going to have a long weekend up at Jawbone Flats on his little
2:24:06
piece of private land there where we had a house and a kind of a lodge.
2:24:13
He wanted to drum up the fact that the Forest Service was
2:24:17
really screwing things up.
2:24:18
And he invited Art McKee from H.J. Andrews to come up and talk about old growth.
2:24:26
By that time, we were close enough together, and Art McKee was astute enough,
2:24:33
he said, "You know, I want to go up there, but I don't want to go up and get George
2:24:40
to maneuver me into dumping on the Forest Service." He asked me to go with him.
2:24:48
George didn't know about this, but Art asked me to go with him so there would be
2:24:53
a National Forest representative there, which was great thinking on Art's part.
2:24:59
And I did.
2:25:00
When we got there, George, his eyes kind of got big when he saw me there.
2:25:06
But there was nothing he could do.
2:25:08
Art had invited me, and I was there.
2:25:10
It worked out really well.
2:25:13
In discussions, when he started getting away from good science,
2:25:20
I would talk about the national forests and what we were doing.
2:25:23
What was the resolution for that area?
2:25:25
Do you know?
2:25:27
Yeah, well, it's part of a wilderness now, or either a wilderness or a special area.
2:25:34
It has congressional designation now.
2:25:38
Going back to not just the forest [Willamette NF] , but the Northwest
2:25:40
Forest Plan and planning in general.
2:25:43
Do
2:25:45
you think there's too much land reserved now with different designations;
2:25:49
there's an adaptive natural area here, a reserved management area here,
2:25:53
there's this, there's that, there's the old-school primitive areas which
2:25:57
are now mostly wilderness areas.
2:25:59
What's your thinking on that whole pastiche of special categorizations that
2:26:04
have emanated from the last forty years, even before the Northwest Forest Plan?
2:26:08
Well, there's certainly enough.
2:26:13
The good thing about identifying all those special areas and what made
2:26:17
them special, and drawing a line around them, was we recognized them.
2:26:23
We took them out of the timber harvest base calculation.
2:26:27
The bad thing was we drew a line around them, and they all
2:26:31
were special interest areas.
2:26:33
Some way, we've got to evolve into this whole ecosystem management, blur those
2:26:40
lines and do what management makes sense within those areas, and not do
2:26:48
management that doesn't make sense.
2:26:54
I've done some recent reading and the guy, I can't think of his name right
2:26:59
now, he's a fire researcher, he's done a lot of writing about wildfire.
2:27:07
He wrote a book about the 1910 fires, recently, the last few years.
2:27:11
Steve Pyne?
2:27:12
Pyne, Steven Pyne.
2:27:14
He was my mentor.
2:27:15
Well, he wrote an article in
2:27:20
The Pinchot Institute.
2:27:21
Are you familiar with that?
2:27:22
I think so, yeah.
2:27:23
It's a conservation organization, not an environmental organization.
2:27:28
Right.
2:27:29
Stationed at the old Grey Towers, the Pinchot residence [Pennsylvania] . They
2:27:35
have a semi-annual publication, and he wrote an article recently, talking
2:27:40
about how we've got to start thinking differently about wilderness areas,
2:27:45
because they're evolving, the trees are going, fire is becoming rampant,
2:27:53
climate change is causing different regimes, and we may not be able to
2:28:01
maintain wilderness areas in the future.
2:28:04
And we need to look at a broader scale management all the way
2:28:09
from urban areas up through the
2:28:14
wilderness.
2:28:15
That made great sense to me.
2:28:17
I'm on the board of the McKenzie River Trust.
2:28:20
I don't know if you've heard of them.
2:28:22
Yes.
2:28:24
Our simple motto is "protect special places," not preserve special
2:28:33
places, but protect special places.
2:28:37
Fred Swanson has been involved.
2:28:39
We've asked him on several occasions to look at some areas and give us
2:28:43
some advice and interact with us.
2:28:45
And we've been talking with him about his arts-in-residence program,
2:28:51
wondering if we could expand that to the McKenzie River Trust activities.
2:28:56
I'm kind of going around the topic, but that's kind of what the Trust is looking
2:29:03
at in protecting lands not in wilderness.
2:29:07
We “protect.” We have easements on farm lands.
2:29:11
We have easements on managed timber lots.
2:29:15
It's just getting back to what makes sense for this local system.
2:29:21
I think that's where we're going to evolve to, but we're not
2:29:27
going to do away with wilderness areas in the foreseeable future.
2:29:36
Let's continue with the McKenzie River.
2:29:41
You've been around this area for more than 50, 55 years, I guess, 56 years.
2:29:48
Is 1958 when you came back?
2:29:50
'59,
2:29:52
when we came to Oakridge.
2:29:52
So, you've seen it evolve.
2:29:55
And obviously, you weren't just in the McKenzie River area, but you're involved
2:29:58
with the McKenzie River Trust, and you've been involved with the Willamette
2:30:02
[National Forest] going back to the '70s.
2:30:04
How have you seen the McKenzie River Valley and that kind of watershed evolve?
2:30:11
And I'll say culturally and economically, first.
2:30:20
That's a good question.
2:30:23
I think the evolving culturally is the closer you get to
2:30:29
Eugene, the more it's evolved.
2:30:32
You get way up the McKenzie, McKenzie Bridge, in that country, there's lots
2:30:38
and lots of old-timers there that have lived there their whole lives, and their
2:30:44
parents lived there their whole lives.
2:30:51
They've
2:30:54
just integrated with the resource.
2:30:56
At one time, there were mills in Blue River, lots of logging from the
2:31:04
Springfield mills going on up there.
2:31:08
The ownership pattern is urban areas,
2:31:13
industrial privately-owned forest land, national forest, as you go east.
2:31:20
So, that combination of industrial forest lands and national forest lands
2:31:25
provided a good economic base for folks that weren't urban-oriented.
2:31:32
The living wasn't always that great.
2:31:35
It took a while to get electricity all the way up there, and if you look
2:31:38
at some old pictures of the roads, they're just kind of tire tracks.
2:31:42
But folks depended on the natural resources, and that's
2:31:49
tough to do these days.
2:31:51
That area hasn't evolved very well.
2:31:55
There's no big resort that's drawn tourist people in.
2:32:00
It's more of place with people going through it, going from
2:32:03
Eugene to Bend, and Bend to Eugene.
2:32:08
But it's a gorgeous area.
2:32:10
And the McKenzie River itself is a magical name.
2:32:14
You say McKenzie River, people all over the state and outside the
2:32:21
state, know about the McKenzie River.
2:32:25
People come from all over the country to fish the McKenzie River.
2:32:28
Or to float the McKenzie River.
2:32:30
Or to float it.
2:32:31
So, it's a great attraction, it's just economically never been able
2:32:36
to benefit from that very much.
2:32:39
There were the glory years of logging, for 40-50 years maybe?
2:32:46
Yeah, probably late '40s to late '80s.
2:32:52
How many people do you think have adapted, or how well do you think
2:32:55
people have adapted to the changes?
2:32:59
And the old guard, some of them are going to stay up there till they die
2:33:02
because that's where their family is.
2:33:04
Obviously, you don't have percentages, but how would you characterize adaptation of
2:33:10
the culture and people that you've known and met, just an impressionistic view?
2:33:16
I don't know that culturally, it's more of an observation, than
2:33:21
knowing that I'm that involved in the culture that I really know.
2:33:27
Some aspects
2:33:31
have developed okay, like the river guides.
2:33:35
There's several families doing that for generations and generations.
2:33:40
The young folks that stayed there and became river guides
2:33:43
are continuing the business.
2:33:47
Logging families, the same with lots of rural communities, the young folks leave.
2:33:55
Sometimes the young folks leave like in other places, get a good
2:34:01
basis of income and come back.
2:34:05
And there's lots of moneyed people living up the McKenzie.
2:34:11
It's just not very obvious.
2:34:13
They're tucked back along the river or above the river, and I don't know how
2:34:18
involved they are in the community.
2:34:20
Some of them, again, it's not a broad brush either way.
2:34:24
Some of them get involved to an extent and some of them don't.
2:34:30
Some of them
2:34:35
use their money positively, and some don't.
2:34:37
Like, the McKenzie School District was looking forever to have a developed track
2:34:45
for their track team, one that was to the standard they could have track meets
2:34:50
there, rather than having to go elsewhere.
2:34:54
Aaron Jones' wife, the Seneca Mill family, donated the money to build a track there.
2:35:02
So, some of that goes back into the community, and I'm
2:35:05
sure some of it doesn't.
2:35:10
How about Blue River, the town of Blue River?
2:35:13
A little bit further down, but right by the Andrews?
2:35:17
Blue River at one time had a Les Schwab Tire Center, if you can drive through
2:35:22
it these days and envision that.
2:35:26
It was back when they were building the Cougar Dam
2:35:34
and the Blue River Reservoir.
2:35:35
So, it was a boom town?
2:35:38
It was a boom town.
2:35:39
There was at least one mill right there between the town and the high school.
2:35:45
Do you remember the name of the mill?
2:35:47
No.
2:35:47
It had a mill pond.
2:35:49
It was south of the old road that goes from the high school to town.
2:35:56
And it's where there's a kind of a flat area and an opening; you can see that.
2:36:01
There might have been other activities, I just don't remember.
2:36:06
And when I go up the McKenzie, I rarely go into Blue River these days, so I
2:36:13
really don't know what's going on there.
2:36:15
I know they're struggling.
2:36:17
Little mom and pop stores come and go.
2:36:22
Well, I think the highway being routed around the city really hurt.
2:36:30
Yeah, it did, plus the loss of the logging family income.
2:36:37
So, they're really struggling.
2:36:39
It's not a very attractive community.
2:36:44
But the communities further down are more urban-connected,
2:36:50
would that be fair to say?
2:36:52
Vida, and obviously Leaburg and Walterville.
2:36:56
You get farther down, you're almost in Springfield?
2:36:58
Right.
2:36:59
And I'm sure there's a lot of commuters in those communities that work outside the
2:37:04
community down towards or in Springfield and Eugene, but like living up there.
2:37:12
Lane Transit runs a bus all the way up the McKenzie.
2:37:15
A lot of Forest Service people have used it in the past.
2:37:19
I don't know how much it's used now.
2:37:21
It makes for a long day, I hear.
2:37:23
Yeah, it is.
2:37:24
It's a long day.
2:37:26
It runs twice a day, I think, something like that.
2:37:30
Yeah.
2:37:31
But
2:37:34
your activities with the McKenzie River Trust, tell me what that all involves.
2:37:40
The trust itself, but you, specifically.
2:37:43
Well, the trust, it's a land trust.
2:37:47
It protects lands by, we get the protection a number of ways.
2:37:53
Sometimes easements, which restricts, the landowner still owns the land, but some
2:38:01
development activities are restricted.
2:38:04
And that goes, the easement is part of the property deed, so
2:38:08
it's forever part of the property.
2:38:10
And generally, it's not to build additional structures.
2:38:16
But also, we own land or we've purchased easements.
2:38:22
Almost like a Nature Conservancy kind of a strategy?
2:38:25
On a local basis.
2:38:26
Right.
2:38:26
Yeah, we fill the local niche.
2:38:28
There's lands that folks have wanted to get involved with the
2:38:32
Nature Conservancy, and they say, no, that doesn't meet our goals.
2:38:39
But we're a niche that can deal with that.
2:38:42
So, we can purchase easements or purchase land, or we get donations, or we get
2:38:48
what we call bargain sales where we pay people less than full value for the land.
2:38:53
There's lots of ways that we can do activities.
2:38:59
All told, we've been pretty-successful.
2:39:02
We've evolved to the point where we're protecting land
2:39:10
in a contiguous fashion.
2:39:12
So, there may be some Bureau of Land Management land, there may be a state
2:39:17
park, and then there may be some McKenzie River Trust protected land, which makes
2:39:23
your protection cover a much larger area, so it's for particularly things like
2:39:30
wildlife habitat and watershed protection.
2:39:33
It's much more effective than little parcels.
2:39:35
Where is the lowest point on the river where you're active?
2:39:41
We're active in primarily in Lane County, but we're called the McKenzie River Trust.
2:39:47
We have lands protected in the Siuslaw watershed.
2:39:51
Okay.
2:39:51
So it's not just the McKenzie River?
2:39:53
No, the trust was formed in 1989, and then, in about 2001
2:40:03
or 2002, we made the decision to move out of just the McKenzie
2:40:08
River drainage, and we have some protected land in Douglas County.
2:40:12
As
2:40:14
for your question in the McKenzie River, how far down we come; Green Island,
2:40:19
which is a large, almost 1,000-acre island west of Coburg where the McKenzie
2:40:26
and the Willamette come together.
2:40:28
All the way at the bottom?
2:40:29
Yeah.
2:40:30
So, basically all the way up to almost Clear Lake?
2:40:35
We have gone up to Whitewater Creek, which is out of McKenzie Bridge.
2:40:42
And we have acquired several parcels totally surrounded by National
2:40:47
Forest land in the upper drainage the Forest Service wanted to
2:40:51
own, and we've sold them to them.
2:40:53
After we acquired them, we sold them to the Forest Service.
2:40:56
So, what would you describe your overriding mission and how would
2:41:00
you describe your successes?
2:41:04
Our overriding mission is to protect special lands.
2:41:08
So then, you've got to define special, and that's left open because
2:41:14
of evolving desires and needs.
2:41:20
Right now, our emphasis is on riparian areas, salmon streams, that kind of thing.
2:41:28
If you were going to look,
2:41:32
what are your biggest concerns for the McKenzie River area from
2:41:37
a conservation perspective, things that you may be able to address
2:41:41
with what you do through the trust?
2:41:46
You know, the McKenzie River is a unique river.
2:41:51
You look, even today, environmental groups bringing lawsuit against timber sales,
2:42:01
and they're thinnings, not clear-cuts.
2:42:05
You sit down, look back and say, we've got this expanse of industrial timber
2:42:13
lands and national forest lands, that
2:42:21
well, I was saying, we've got timber sales now that are protested and
2:42:30
taken to court, that are small-volume thinning sales, essentially.
2:42:36
The contention is that it's going to degrade the McKenzie River
2:42:45
terribly.
2:42:46
You think back to that array of heavily-logged industrial timber land
2:42:57
between Springfield and the National Forest boundary, and the National Forest
2:43:01
itself, heavy clear-cut logging and road-building for 40-plus years, year
2:43:09
after year after year, and we still say the McKenzie is one of the purest
2:43:15
rivers in the state and the country.
2:43:20
We don't need to get complacent about that.
2:43:24
That's a great thing.
2:43:25
But we need to make sure it stays that way, not by taking low-impact timber sales
2:43:33
to court, but by insuring that key pieces of the drainage, the riparian areas, the
2:43:40
waterways, remain intact and protected, and that development doesn't encroach
2:43:46
right down to the main river itself.
2:43:50
And with all the urban kind of pesticide applications, runoff and that kind
2:43:58
of thing, from removing vegetation.
2:44:01
So, that's our main thrust now, to look at key wildlife habitat areas that are part
2:44:09
of the riparian system in the McKenzie, outside the National Forest boundary.
2:44:09
There
2:44:13
is nothing we can do within the National Forest boundary.
2:44:15
What
2:44:19
was the deal with the timber sale last year that brought up
2:44:24
such a firestorm, I believe, with residents in McKenzie Bridge area?
2:44:27
Yeah.
2:44:28
Explain that to me a little better?
2:44:30
Well, I don't know a whole lot about that.
2:44:32
That was a partial cut, a thinning sale.
2:44:38
The one you were talking about?
2:44:40
Well, the one you're talking about is.
2:44:42
But, okay.
2:44:42
Yeah.
2:44:43
Well, I was kind of referring to that one.
2:44:44
Well, okay.
2:44:45
It was inferring.
2:44:47
But thinking of that as
2:44:49
-- And other ones like that.
2:44:50
And other ones like it.
2:44:52
But there may have been some small, several-acre clear-cuts.
2:44:58
I really don't, I'm not that familiar with the sale.
2:45:01
But I think the biggest problem was it was kind of a surprise
2:45:06
to folks that live there.
2:45:07
Some of the timber sale boundary was up against private landowner boundaries.
2:45:13
And the district thought they had done appropriate landowner contact,
2:45:21
but it turned out maybe they hadn't.
2:45:24
And so, that kind of caused the storm that then, the
2:45:28
environmentalists kind of piled on.
2:45:31
You're getting a real-biased view here on this one.
2:45:34
Well, that's okay.
2:45:35
I'm an advocate of managing our national resources, and that doesn't
2:45:40
mean clear-cutting every acre, but it means knowing what's going on
2:45:44
and managing in a positive way.
2:45:48
Not in my back yard, though, right, in that case?
2:45:51
That I think was the case.
2:45:53
Yeah.
2:45:54
Go on a little more about the trust, if you've got anything
2:45:56
more to say about that?
2:45:58
Well, I think I alluded to it earlier, but
2:46:04
you know, the relationships that were built back with H.J. Andrews and the
2:46:09
Willamette National Forest, have continued with, particularly with Fred Swanson and
2:46:15
I and the McKenzie River Trust, and Fred's
2:46:18
-- And Fred's involved with that?
2:46:19
Fred's involvement with things related to the H.J. Andrews, but actually
2:46:24
wanting to project outside, and the McKenzie River Trust is a good entity
2:46:30
for him, actually to be involved with.
2:46:33
He's helping us look at interaction with public kinds of activities.
2:46:41
I mean, we're totally impressed with that artist-in-residence program Fred's
2:46:46
got going at the H.J. Andrews, and we'd love to take that down to Green Island
2:46:52
and do something in companion with him.
2:46:55
And you know, Fred's a geologist by training, and he's been out
2:46:59
looking at some of the things we're doing on some of our properties
2:47:02
and giving us advice that way, too.
2:47:05
So, it's just a great relationship.
2:47:08
Using that as a segue, we talked quite a bit about Jerry Franklin.
2:47:12
Now, Fred Swanson has been involved with the Andrews for forty years,
2:47:19
and although he is not as well-known as Jerry Franklin, he's well-known
2:47:27
scientifically, but he's also become a shepherd for Andrews-related issues,
2:47:33
amongst other things like the trust.
2:47:36
Tell me about Fred Swanson?
2:47:38
I mean, you've known him many years.
2:47:41
He's done many things in his science career, but also in a kind
2:47:45
of quiet activist kind of way, a quiet philosophic kind of way.
2:47:50
Describe to me Fred and your experience with him?
2:47:53
Well,
2:47:58
I've known Fred since the '80s and that incident up at Log Cabin
2:48:05
Inn where he came over and sat with the National Forest guys.
2:48:11
And he's always a very consistent guy.
2:48:14
He's just a very gentle guy, well-thought,
2:48:20
world-class thinker, way ahead of anything I'm thinking about.
2:48:25
He always introduces new ideas to me when I visit with him.
2:48:30
He's very respectful of folks, very respectful of the environment.
2:48:37
A
2:48:40
real leader at H.J. Andrews, very quiet backroom kind of
2:48:45
leader, not flamboyant like Jerry Franklin, but touching bases and
2:48:55
suggesting things that ought to happen or things that people ought to be aware of.
2:49:01
Just, I've got great respect for him.
2:49:09
Tell me more about the artists-in-residence and his interest
2:49:13
in furthering the humanities as a close partner with the sciences because,
2:49:21
of course, the NSF and the sciences and the central cadre, funding and
2:49:26
otherwise, of the NSF-type projects and the LTER system, have always
2:49:30
been dominated by the hard sciences.
2:49:33
And he's made it a big mission of his to bring the “touchy-feely
2:49:39
stuff,” the humanities, the literature, the art, into that realm.
2:49:43
You mentioned a little bit about your interest in that for the trust?
2:49:50
Yeah,
2:49:53
I can't speak for Fred and what his specific interest is, and I
2:49:58
don't know that I've dealt with him in-depth about that, but it's
2:49:59
-- I'm asking more about your view on the whole dynamic.
2:50:05
The whole dynamic is, you just get a broader view.
2:50:09
You get, when you get people from the arts, they think differently
2:50:14
than scientists, and they react differently than scientists.
2:50:18
And that's good to know.
2:50:21
They're part of society, just like the rest of us are.
2:50:28
They have great insight into things that you might not even have even
2:50:32
considered in what you're doing.
2:50:35
And we've got a cosmopolitan world now;
2:50:41
you can't just do things, particularly with public lands
2:50:47
in a box.
2:50:48
You know, it's out in front of everybody.
2:50:54
How do you look on the concept of place?
2:51:05
And I can explain what I mean further if you want, but I'll let you go
2:51:09
with just with that pure question.
2:51:11
I don't know.
2:51:13
At one time, I was really into thinking about the concept of place, and trying
2:51:19
to see how it fit in with land management planning, local areas, that kind of thing.
2:51:31
So, I was pretty serious about it at one time, and then, I've kind of evolved.
2:51:37
It's just another name.
2:51:40
I think I'm getting too old for some of this stuff.
2:51:42
It's just, you see cycles, fads, and names and
2:51:48
-- Well, for instance, this is a place.
2:51:51
Yeah.
2:51:52
The McKenzie River, you've been involved with professionally,
2:51:57
and now, philanthropically;
2:52:01
it's a place.
2:52:03
It has physical attributes and cultural attributes, and these
2:52:09
attachments and interpretive dynamics for people evolve over time.
2:52:16
Do you believe that this has a lot to do with why it is such a struggle, but
2:52:23
also such an interesting part of the American land management matrix, that
2:52:30
we have these developed senses of place?
2:52:34
Oh, yeah.
2:52:35
Without question, people develop a real feeling and ownership in places and areas.
2:52:46
We've had discussions from a fundraising standpoint with the McKenzie
2:52:51
River Trust, about people who have
2:52:58
summer homes or part-year homes, homes they don't live
2:53:03
in year-round up the McKenzie.
2:53:06
They come from San Francisco, very urban areas, a very urban life,
2:53:11
but part of their life they want to spend up the McKenzie, and
2:53:14
that's very important to them.
2:53:16
We've had discussions about how do you identify that feeling of sense of place
2:53:23
to the point that folks that have that feeling, whether they've identified
2:53:29
it or not, they're implementing it, how do you transfer that into
2:53:36
donations for a charitable cause?
2:53:40
So, we've talked about that a lot.
2:53:42
I mean, it's certainly, that's there.
2:53:46
There's some property downstream from Fern Ridge.
2:53:51
The Long Tom River flows into Fern Ridge, and then out and north.
2:53:57
There's a family that's owned land, this is like the third generation,
2:54:05
and each generation, it gets parceled into smaller pieces because
2:54:10
it's a finite section of land.
2:54:14
So now it's down to where we were talking to a lady from, with a McKenzie
2:54:20
River Trust business that lives over there outside the owned property, but
2:54:26
she owns twenty acres in the middle of an inaccessible piece of land, and she
2:54:33
feels very, very strongly about that.
2:54:37
You can think, well, what are you ever going to do with it?
2:54:41
You can't even access it, you can't even get there now because of the brush.
2:54:45
But she's attached to the place for some reason.
2:54:49
Yeah, it's her place.
2:54:50
I mean, that's just an example of how people feel about places, how
2:54:55
they can become important to them.
2:54:57
Where was your favorite posting, can you say that you had one?
2:55:00
Posting?
2:55:01
Posting or station.
2:55:06
Place you were stationed at, especially those, that first 15-18-20 years
2:55:11
before you got kind of more permanent here in the Eugene-Springfield area.
2:55:15
Well, I'm going to give you a wishy-washy answer.
2:55:18
A guy, one of my employees asked me that when I was at Sweet Home,
2:55:22
you know, we were talking about all the different places I'd been.
2:55:26
I worked on four different ranger districts in the Willamette Forest, worked
2:55:30
in eastern Oregon, worked on the Coast.
2:55:32
He said, "Where's your favorite?" And I said, "You know, I think it's where
2:55:38
I'm at, at this point in time." It's just, it's the one I'm working at.
2:55:44
But that goes along with what you were saying all along about
2:55:47
I'm ready for the next challenge?
2:55:50
Well, I want to be ready for the next challenge, but that doesn't mean I don't
2:55:54
like what I'm doing at that point in time.
2:55:59
I've enjoyed every assignment I've had.
2:56:01
I haven't had a bad assignment, other than maybe that ten years
2:56:05
of land management planning.
2:56:09
A little tongue-in-cheek there?
2:56:11
The “lost decade” [s]
2:56:14
. In the “lost decade.” But do you have, what would be some favorite places
2:56:19
you have, just out there in nature?
2:56:26
Camping spots, fishing spots?
2:56:28
There's a trail, I don't know if you're that familiar with the Old
2:56:32
Cascades and the New Cascades?
2:56:36
The New Cascades are the recent volcanoes, the Three Sisters.
2:56:40
Yeah, I know.
2:56:41
You know, Mt. Jeff.
2:56:42
Geologically, yes.
2:56:43
Yeah, geologically.
2:56:44
And then west of the New Cascades is a lower range of
2:56:51
mountains that have been there.
2:56:53
Yeah, they're much older.
2:56:53
Much older, a different geologic type.
2:56:56
The greatest definition of that is if you drive up Highway 20 from Sweet
2:57:01
Home to Santiam Pass; you go over Tombstone Pass, which is the Old
2:57:05
Cascades, and then you drop down, and then you get up over Santiam Pass.
2:57:10
Well, in that Tombstone Pass area, there's a trail that goes up to, oh, I'm
2:57:19
not going to remember the name of it.
2:57:21
There's Iron Mountain Lookout, and it has great wildflowers, but if you walk
2:57:29
on around to the west, there's a trail that loops around for three or four
2:57:34
miles and comes out in Tombstone Pass.
2:57:38
There's a great meadow along the side of one of those Old Cascades,
2:57:45
almost mountains, worn-down mountains, I guess would be a way of saying it.
2:57:49
That's a favorite place for me.
2:57:52
For ten years after I retired, I volunteered to
2:57:57
maintain that trail up there.
2:57:59
I've told my kids that that's the place to put my ashes.
2:58:04
And what's the name of the mountain?
2:58:05
It's by Iron Mountain then?
2:58:08
I could tell you.
2:58:08
I mean, let me look in my file here.
2:58:13
So, the area's Cone Peak Meadow, which is on the side of Cone Peak, which is
2:58:19
one of the old, worn-down Cascades that's just west of Iron Mountain Lookout.
2:58:24
Is there a reason why it's called Cone Peak, the shape, or
2:58:27
-- ? I think the shape.
2:58:30
I have many favorite places.
2:58:32
It just depended on where I was in my life.
2:58:35
Yeah.
2:58:35
I mean, there's a few that will always be inspirational, but I think
2:58:39
favorites can change over the course of a lifetime for many people.
2:58:46
Now, how have your views about the ethical responsibility of the
2:58:50
forester and land manager evolved?
2:58:53
And if you were going to kind of put a capstone on it to today now well
2:58:57
into your retirement, you know, toward human society and the natural world?
2:59:02
Just
2:59:09
ask that question again?
2:59:11
I kind of mangled it there a little bit.
2:59:13
How have your views about the ethical responsibilities of the forest and
2:59:17
land manager evolved during your career toward human society and the
2:59:20
non-human natural world, and even extend that from your active Forest
2:59:25
Service days into the retirement years?
2:59:31
Well, the Forest Service has always prided itself in having a strong
2:59:38
ethical approach to management.
2:59:41
Some folks take issue with that, and probably rightly so in some
2:59:48
instances, but that's always been, that the strong culture of the Forest
2:59:53
Service is an ethical approach.
2:59:55
I think how that's changed over time is through more
2:59:59
knowledge, more understanding.
3:00:04
Developing different ways to look at the natural system from a standpoint
3:00:09
of not isolated instances or areas, but from a much broader perspective,
3:00:17
from an ecosystem standpoint.
3:00:20
And understanding, not only that there are interrelationships between
3:00:27
everything going on in the forest, but understand what those relationships
3:00:33
are, and how impacting one aspect has repercussions beyond that single
3:00:44
approach you might be looking at.
3:00:47
I always had the impression, although I haven't done research on
3:00:50
this subject, that Forest Service managers, regardless of the era
3:00:56
and dominant paradigm, utilitarian
3:01:00
vs.
3:01:00
holistic management,
3:01:07
that regarding ethics, there was always a pretty-strong “ethic” in the
3:01:10
Forest Service. In other words, they couldn't be “bribed.” That always
3:01:16
has been that ethic, even before the modern, holistic management days.
3:01:21
And that's been pretty-true all along?
3:01:26
Yeah, that comes from Gifford Pinchot.
3:01:29
You look at his early readings, and look at his approach to managing the national
3:01:36
forests, and that's very, very strong.
3:01:49
We're almost done.
3:01:50
Now, what experiences have you had outside the Pacific Northwest, living,
3:01:55
traveling or working, perhaps that you haven't talked about yet, as a
3:01:59
youth or early in your professional life or even later, which provided
3:02:02
context and points of comparison for how you viewed the Northwest coniferous
3:02:07
forest’s ecology and the Cascades?
3:02:15
Big picture.
3:02:15
That almost sounds like a leading question.
3:02:18
But I'll go beyond that.
3:02:23
I've always liked to travel.
3:02:25
I've always been really interested in rural areas and rural communities and
3:02:36
spaces outside civilization.
3:02:39
I don't know where that comes from.
3:02:41
I don't try and fight it.
3:02:43
I just try and go with it.
3:02:45
I'm a birder.
3:02:49
I like to look at birds.
3:02:51
I've got a good friend, that for the last, probably close to fifteen years,
3:02:58
every year we take a ten-day to two-week trip somewhere to look at birds.
3:03:06
So, I've seen the whole southern part of the country from East Coast to
3:03:10
West Coast; we've been up in Canada.
3:03:13
And really seen.
3:03:16
When you bird, you're doing a lot of other things, too.
3:03:19
You're driving through national parks, you're driving through wildlife
3:03:23
refuges, you're driving through national monuments and historic sites,
3:03:28
and through different communities.
3:03:30
You can get immersed in all of that, and still bird.
3:03:35
That's what we've done.
3:03:36
And so, I've just seen a lot of this country and I always liked coming
3:03:41
back to the Pacific Northwest.
3:03:42
We've got a unique area here.
3:03:45
Fortunately,
3:03:48
our climate is a fairly-mild and moist climate, gives us a lot of
3:03:55
vegetation, and aesthetically, is very pretty, and economically,
3:04:01
there are lots of opportunities.
3:04:05
I don't know if that answers your question.
3:04:07
No, that's perfect.
3:04:08
I mean, it's just
3:04:11
like that kind of travel provides context for this place.
3:04:16
How does the birding compare?
3:04:18
Birding's
3:04:20
where we go.
3:04:21
I mean, we go to places during migration, and so we expect to see a lot of birds.
3:04:28
But
3:04:31
you can't hardly beat the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge south of Burns.
3:04:37
It's a great place for birding.
3:04:40
What are some of your favorite species there?
3:04:43
People ask me that question, and it gets back to, I like seeing
3:04:48
birds in their natural habitat.
3:04:52
I'm not really interested in them if they're not.
3:04:55
For instance, the last few years, there's been a northern mockingbird, which is
3:04:59
not a western Oregon bird, spending winter down the road here in Alvadore.
3:05:06
It took me about two years to go down there and look at it, because I'm seeing
3:05:11
a mockingbird outside of its habitat.
3:05:13
What is that experience?
3:05:19
But anyway, birds.
3:05:21
I like powerful birds like pileated woodpeckers, golden eagles.
3:05:27
But actually, just whatever I'm looking at.
3:05:31
Looking at robins is great.
3:05:33
Have you seen a change in the patterns, migration and otherwise, as
3:05:38
climate change is becoming more real?
3:05:42
No.
3:05:46
But I haven't consciously, I haven't documented things in a way
3:05:51
that would tell me, seasonally.
3:05:53
Every year, you see things different.
3:05:55
Like this year, I haven't seen very many violet-green swallows out on my property.
3:06:03
Usually, I get tree swallows and violet-green swallows, and
3:06:06
I have nest boxes up for them.
3:06:09
They both come in about equal amounts, about the same time.
3:06:13
This year, I've seen a lot of tree swallows, not very
3:06:16
many violet-green swallows.
3:06:17
But I can't say that's because of climate change.
3:06:19
You're not out doing bird counts in other words?
3:06:21
Right, yeah.
3:06:23
What about up the McKenzie River Valley?
3:06:26
What are some of the species up there?
3:06:29
Well, birds like to go around water, so if you're on any of the reservoirs
3:06:35
or open-meadowed areas, you see birds.
3:06:38
You don't see a lot of birds in the forest.
3:06:41
Birds like edge cover, you know, where they can have protection from vegetation,
3:06:47
and get out in the open to feed.
3:06:49
And there's some forest birds, woodpeckers, flickers,
3:06:55
some warblers, but
3:06:59
if you're really looking for good birding, you don't go up in the forest.
3:07:03
You ever been to Ramsey Canyon in Arizona?
3:07:05
Oh, yeah.
3:07:07
Several times.
3:07:09
Madera Canyon?
3:07:10
Yeah, a number of times.
3:07:12
The first time I went there, I was just blown away.
3:07:16
I hadn't been in the Southwest birding and I probably saw fifty
3:07:21
new birds that I hadn't seen before.
3:07:22
Well, the thing that's amazing about Arizona, in those, what they call, the
3:07:26
“Sky Islands” of the Southwest; the Huachucas and Ramsey Canyon, and the Santa
3:07:31
Ritas and Madera Canyon, and all those big mountains down there, is they recreate
3:07:37
multiple life-zone dynamics within one mountain range, where they say that
3:07:42
these birds can recreate the migrational climate changes without leaving the area.
3:07:48
Having to go far, how many thousands of miles are you going to have to
3:07:51
fly? That's my crude take, not being a
3:07:56
“bird-ologist.” I'm forgetting my word now; ornithologist, right?
3:08:01
An ornithologist, I want that on the record.
3:08:06
I think we're done.
3:08:07
[Break in audio]
3:08:07
When you look at the Andrews today, with its fully-developed campus,
3:08:17
how would you characterize its evolution?
3:08:20
I mean, that's physical infrastructure, but it's very symbolic of a
3:08:25
maturation process, but how would you characterize its growth?
3:08:31
Well, its growth was slow, and evolution is the right term.
3:08:37
They started out with tents, and then the Willamette Forest thought
3:08:45
they were doing them a great favor by moving some old trailers that
3:08:50
they had in Oakridge over there.
3:08:52
And they were doing them a great favor, but the trailers weren't all that
3:08:55
great, but they were better than a tent.
3:08:58
And they've just slowly built and built and built.
3:09:01
And I think that's reflecting the growing recognition and respect
3:09:09
that our political world has for the H.J. Andrews, because none of
3:09:13
that would have happened without congressional appropriations.
3:09:17
And so, they've worked that well and they're getting a return
3:09:24
in that respect and confidence.
3:09:28
And you heard the name that they used to call the old trailer park up
3:09:32
there, the "Ghetto in the Meadow?"
3:09:33
Yeah, right.
3:09:35
And the stories about somebody falling through the floor of the shower one time?
3:09:42
Yeah, it's come a long ways.
3:09:44
When, I don't get up there very often.
3:09:46
When I did, it's, geez, you know, none of this was here when I started out.
3:09:53
You've been to HJA Days, haven't you?
3:09:56
Not recently.
3:10:02
And how would you describe the evolution of the Willamette National Forest, since
3:10:06
you've been involved with it for so many years, professionally, even knowing
3:10:11
what's going on after you've been retired?
3:10:16
Well, I'm a grumpy-old retiree.
3:10:19
You know, I
3:10:22
don't look at the current forest super-positively.
3:10:26
I'm a product of my mentors, who were old-time Forest Service folks,
3:10:33
the old can-do, we'll make it work,
3:10:39
strong work ethic, strong
3:10:43
Forest Service ethic.
3:10:46
We just seem real scattered now, real dispersed.
3:10:51
I'm not sure where the forests are heading, and as an agency, we don't
3:10:57
seem to be able to get a handle on that.
3:11:00
And we've lost our leadership role, I think.
3:11:04
We're not leaders, we're just trying to hang on.
3:11:07
And maybe when you get to that point, you shouldn't be hanging on.
3:11:13
We should be providing leadership.
3:11:17
You know, one time, we were the eminent natural resource
3:11:20
management agency in the world.
3:11:24
I don't know that there are many people who would give us that
3:11:31
thought now.
3:11:34
I would say Rolf that we have wrapped it up very well.
3:11:37
We've talked for almost three hours and fifteen minutes on the record,
3:11:41
so I want to thank you very much for meeting with me today and being part
3:11:44
of this project on the H.J. Andrews history and about your own career.
3:11:48
Thank you.
3:11:49
Okay, Sam, well, thank you for the opportunity.
