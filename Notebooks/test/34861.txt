00:02
Hello, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State University College of
00:06
Forestry, working on a history project involving the Andrews Experimental
00:12
Forest ecological research and land management issues in general.
00:17
Today, we are at the home of Michael Kerrick, now retired and U.S. Forest
00:22
Service Supervisor/Ranger for many years, who has also been involved with the
00:28
Willamette National Forest, the Andrews Forest, amongst many other things.
00:31
We going to be doing an oral history interview here today,
00:34
which is May 9, 2014, in his home in, I won't say, East Springfield.
00:41
Where are we actually, Dearhorn?
00:42
Dearhorn, right.
00:42
[Unincorporated community in McKenzie River Valley.]
00:42
We're in Dearhorn, which is a Springfield address, and we're going
00:46
to sit here and talk about Mike's life, his career, and focus some
00:52
on the Andrews Experimental Forest.
00:54
But we're going to also go more broadly than that.
00:56
So, good morning, Mike, how are you?
00:58
Good, good.
00:59
I want to thank you for being willing to do this.
01:02
I know this is a big time commitment, but I hope that you will enjoy your journey
01:06
down memory lane and recycling some things
01:11
from your past.
01:12
We'll start as basic as you possibly can.
01:15
Where were you born and raised, or just tell me a biographical
01:19
sketch on your own terms?
01:21
Okay, I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the depth of the Depression.
01:27
I was a "Depression Baby." And my father was an artist, and you can
01:33
imagine being a starving artist in the Depression was pretty tough.
01:40
So, I grew up attending public schools.
01:43
I did so-so.
01:46
I did well enough to get into the University of Minnesota.
01:52
I attended the School of Forestry on the Ag campus
02:01
beginning in 1950, and I graduated in 1954.
02:07
I grew up liking or loving the outdoors.
02:12
Myself and a friend spent three summers canoeing, one when I was
02:19
15 down the St. Croix River, from Danbury all the way to Stillwater,
02:27
which was near our summer home.
02:30
Is that in northern Minnesota?
02:31
No, it's actually Stillwater, well the St. Croix divides.
02:38
It is the boundary between Minnesota and Wisconsin.
02:43
It was about a 100-mile trip, I think.
02:47
And how old were you then?
02:49
Fifteen.
02:50
Okay, right.
02:50
And you know, thinking back, wow, my parents had some
02:55
confidence in me and my buddy.
03:00
Anyway, we were gone for about a month and had a great trip.
03:03
And the next year, we
03:06
went into the boundary waters canoe area and up into the Quetico Provincial
03:14
Park in Canada, and spent a month there.
03:17
And then the next year, I was 17, graduated from high school, and we
03:24
spent five weeks on a canoe trip from Ely-Winton, Minnesota, all the way
03:32
up to the Canadian National Railway and back, and had a great trip.
03:37
So, that kind of explains my interest, or at least my thoughts about forestry, a
03:46
love of the outdoors, and thinking of it.
03:48
Do you remember something even more, shall we say, seminal, early-on, a "wow" moment,
03:58
something that you saw, maybe a book or you heard a story, or you saw a movie,
04:04
or you even experienced something in the outdoors, maybe as even grade-school
04:10
age or younger, that really wowed you, really impressed you, and started to
04:14
draw you toward what you started to develop there in your adolescent years?
04:17
No, I can't.
04:18
You know,
04:23
I was just bound and determined to go into forestry.
04:26
I didn't change majors, kind of interesting.
04:30
Part of that, part of going through college, had I had my druthers, because
04:37
I had to support myself, my folks just didn't have the wherewithal.
04:41
In fact, I was part of that generation that was the first
04:46
to have been to college.
04:48
My parents, I don't know that my dad graduated from high school.
04:53
He was an artist.
04:55
He went, his schooling was in the Minneapolis Institute of Art, New
05:00
York, and he spent years in Paris.
05:04
So
05:06
he had a whole different educational experience.
05:10
He loved classical music, and he toyed with the piano.
05:15
He was a remarkable guy.
05:18
And his background was, you know, he talked about his early
05:23
days cruising timber and stuff.
05:25
I don't know if he actually did that, but he might have.
05:29
He was born in Park Rapids, Minnesota, up in the northern part of Minnesota.
05:35
So, there probably was some guidance there, too.
05:38
There was certainly a strong support to go on, continue the education.
05:44
All of my brothers
05:49
started at least, and all three of us graduated.
05:52
And my oldest brother actually got a master's in teaching.
06:00
So, we all went to college, which was pretty remarkable.
06:04
And my oldest brother went through the G.I. Bill, and some of the other
06:09
guys, the other two, were supported.
06:13
But I supported myself.
06:14
Gosh, I worked 40 hours a week sometimes.
06:20
And I managed to matriculate with a B-average
06:28
after a kind of a dull start as a freshman, which was a
06:34
crippling year for a lot of folks.
06:36
And me, too.
06:38
I was just a little bit above a C. So, I had lots of A's along the way in order to
06:46
-- Pull it back up?
06:46
Pull it back up, right.
06:48
So, anyways, the other thing that was kind of demanding, if you remember, it
06:54
was in the early '50s and we had a draft.
06:58
I had a student deferral.
07:01
A lot of my buddies
07:05
stopped school and were drafted.
07:09
And so, I figured I'll continue on.
07:13
I did and graduated.
07:14
So, there was some motivation in getting the grades up?
07:17
Yeah, right.
07:18
Like the Korean War, right?
07:19
Right, yeah, yeah.
07:20
And by the time I
07:22
-- Because there was Korea, right?
07:23
Yeah, but by the time I graduated, the Korean War was pretty well over.
07:29
So,
07:32
the draft was still on.
07:34
In fact, I got my draft notice January 1, I think early January of 1956, after I'd
07:42
married and we had a child on the way.
07:46
I explained to the draft board that I was hoping I could delay the draft
07:53
until such time as our child was born and we could get through that.
08:01
The response was, "Oh, you're going to have a baby? Well,
08:04
we don't need you." [Laughs]
08:06
So, you got out of military service because of your first child.
08:09
Right?
08:10
Yeah.
08:10
And my three other brothers were all in the service.
08:15
My brother John, it was kind of interesting.
08:17
He joined the
08:22
Wisconsin National Guard to avoid the draft.
08:26
This was just about the time of the Berlin Crisis, they called up the Wisconsin
08:32
National Guard, and it was quite a deal.
08:35
They came by train out to Fort Lewis to do their basic [training] . And they had
08:40
lots of beer from Wisconsin on the train.
08:45
Oh, lordy.
08:46
Anyways,
08:51
that's my recollection anyways, and I graduated from the university 60 years
08:59
ago, so the memories are a little faint.
09:02
Now,
09:05
what was the name of your high school, by the way?
09:07
West High School in Minneapolis, which is no longer there.
09:12
Were there any natural resource or science classes, or something
09:17
in the educational realm that connected you to what you did later?
09:21
No, I don't recall.
09:23
Not that I took, you know, like a 4-H thing.
09:26
I
09:30
was an urban kid, and it was kind of amazing.
09:34
This urban kid got involved in this natural resource field, which was
09:39
interesting, as lots of my school mates in college were from farms and
09:50
had experience in the north woods.
09:54
But here I was, this urban kid with a burning desire to get
10:00
into a natural resource field.
10:01
And I probably didn't really recognize what I was getting into.
10:05
Was there anything else, like for instance, during the Roosevelt
10:10
Administration and afterwards, the New Deal, your father was a WPA artist,
10:15
you mentioned before the interview.
10:17
Right.
10:17
But there was a lot of promotion of a lot of agencies that became really
10:24
big agencies after World War II; the Forest Service, the Park Service, the
10:28
whole promoting of saving America, seeing America, all that kind of stuff.
10:32
Do you remember any of those things, or even a hero or a public figure
10:37
who was in forestry or national parks, making an impact on you?
10:42
Well, in college, of course, Gifford Pinchot was, a hero.
10:46
But that was in college.
10:51
Yeah, he was certainly a heroic figure, and many of the folks
10:58
that followed Gifford were heroes in the forestry community.
11:04
And
11:08
I started,
11:11
it's amazing, I came out to Oregon in 1951.
11:16
We had a summer school, one session in the summer at Lake Itasca [Minnesota]
11:24
, another field research facility.
11:29
And following that, there were still about seven weeks before school started.
11:36
So, I and another guy said, "Well, let's head west." We got a ride with
11:42
another guy that had a job in Missoula [Montana] . Then we hitch-hiked
11:47
from there and we ended up in, interesting, we ended up in Eugene.
11:52
We finally had to take the train, from some small town in Montana
11:58
that we couldn't get out of.
11:59
We took the train.
12:03
I got ahold of my grandfather, who I thought might support our way out.
12:10
And he did, he telegrammed, wired some money out.
12:15
So, we ended up in Eugene.
12:18
And we had a friend of a friend of a friend, who thought we could get a job.
12:24
I can't recall how we got to their house, but 1839 Orchard,
12:29
you probably know where that is.
12:30
Orchard Street?
12:31
Yeah, it's right by campus [University of Oregon] there.
12:33
Yeah, yeah.
12:33
Anyway, we ended up there on the doorstep.
12:37
Folks by the name of Burchams, and Keo is now 103 years old.
12:44
And, you know, from that day forward, she was like a grandmother or a mother
12:50
figure, a grandmother figure to our kids.
12:53
It was just an amazing
12:54
-- What's her name again?
12:55
Keo Burcham.
12:58
That's an old Eugene name, isn't it?
12:59
Yeah, I believe so.
13:01
Yeah.
13:02
Her husband was Roy Burcham, who ran some restaurants, owned some restaurants
13:06
downtown on Willamette Street.
13:09
Ended up in
13:13
the United Way organization, and I think, retired in the Tri-Cities area.
13:20
Anyways, Keo and I go back, you know, golly, I guess, well, more than 60 years.
13:31
He knew a fellow that was an inspector for the Oregon Department
13:38
of Forestry, and he got us a job.
13:41
And that was in 1951, correct?
13:43
1951, yeah.
13:44
Before you were just a sophomore, right?
13:47
Well, I was between a freshman and sophomore, but it was in-between.
13:51
So,
13:54
we ended up at Swisshome, Oregon, down near the coast.
13:58
By Deadwood, right?
13:59
Isn't that by Deadwood?
13:59
Well, a little further west from Deadwood, yeah, closer to, well,
14:05
God, what's the name of that?
14:06
Mapleton?
14:06
Mapleton, yeah.
14:09
Anyways, and they had a bunk house there.
14:11
And so we worked on the road crew running slope stakes and putting the
14:21
design onto the ground for construction.
14:25
1951, this was the year of the big fires.
14:29
I don't know if you remember,
14:35
we had a fire here in the Willamette, the Hee-Hee Fire, in June, which is
14:39
unheard of, I mean it was really dry.
14:41
Usually, it's August, September, October in Oregon?
14:45
Yeah, right, when these large fuels dry out enough that they become a real threat.
14:49
So, the Hee-Hee Fire was in June, and the Sardine Creek Fire up at
14:53
Detroit [Oregon] was also in June.
14:56
I was on a fire over at Scottsburg, on the highway down towards Coos Bay,
15:05
my first experience on a wildfire.
15:08
This is all in 1951.
15:10
So in 1953, I came back out, no '52, rather, and they had a program
15:17
called Student Referrals, so that the western schools didn't get
15:25
dibs on all the jobs out west.
15:27
And this has something, in other words, this announcement came through the
15:30
department you were in at Minnesota.
15:32
Correct?
15:32
Yeah, right, through the school.
15:36
So, I signed up for that and got a job at the McKenzie Bridge in 1952.
15:42
And
15:46
I always talk about that job was the state-of-the-art in
15:50
remote sensing in those days.
15:52
Explain.
15:53
I was part of a two-man crew that had, and we called it "double-Abneys."
15:57
We had an Abney [survey tool] at the bottom and an Abney at the top,
16:02
and made an average of the readings.
16:05
And you ran prepared contour maps in a field, in a type map, the
16:12
"Forest Type Map," and you spent the summer, probably, you got maybe
16:20
a section-and-a-half done, maybe.
16:22
And you had controls.
16:24
You know, you had to go up and back, and closed.
16:26
Anyway, so you produced a map that the foresters then used for presale, for
16:34
laying out roads and that sort of thing.
16:37
I always call it, the state-of-the-art remote sensing.
16:40
Now, of course, you've got GIS and all kind of
16:43
- LIDAR?
16:43
Yeah, LIDAR, right.
16:45
I mean, that's amazing, that laser thing.
16:48
Yeah, gets tree heights and everything else.
16:51
Kind of the morphology of almost every needle.
16:54
Not quite, but
16:56
- So, in 1952, we were on the bank of the south fork in McKenzie at Rider
17:02
Creek, which is now, they call it Terwilliger Hot Springs, you know?
17:09
Right, correct.
17:10
The infamous.
17:12
And in those days, of course, it was not known.
17:14
Although, way back in the early 1900's,
17:19
that hot springs was known.
17:21
In fact, there was a fighter that had a training camp near there
17:27
and he would soak in those pools.
17:30
So, I guess, you know, they were very primitive back then.
17:32
I will merely state that in my high school and shortly thereafter
17:36
years, some of my friends and I may have visited that location.
17:43
[Laughter] I will take "The Fifth" beyond that, Mike.
17:44
[Known "skinny-dipping" locale.]
17:44
Yeah,
17:47
I don't know if we ever went and used the pools, but we were camped at the mouth
17:51
of Rider Creek right on the south fork.
17:54
This was before the dam, of course.
17:58
And then, I became infatuated with Oregon.
18:03
The huge trees and the forest out here, just pretty amazing
18:09
to a young, impressionable student looking for a career.
18:17
In 1953, I came back and did the same job.
18:21
We were up in Quartz Creek, and the headwaters at Quartz
18:23
Brook, and before the roads.
18:26
So we packed in by pack stock and set up camp at Alder Cove,
18:34
which was just below Wagon Wheel Pass.
18:38
And the story had it that there was a wagon wheel found up there.
18:42
I can't imagine how in the world a wagon could get there, I have a little trouble.
18:48
Place names have incredibly slippery and interesting juxtapositional
18:53
stories of this's and that's, and something happened then, and
18:57
the location shifts conveniently.
18:59
[Laughs]
18:59
Yeah, right.
19:01
Anyways, the next year I graduated.
19:05
And they offered me a job out here at Lowell as a JF [Junior Forester] . Well,
19:12
to begin with, I was a temporary employee.
19:17
What they call seasonal now, right?
19:18
Yeah, seasonal, awaiting the results of the exam and whether you became
19:31
hirable.
19:32
You had to pass.
19:34
I took the exam, and midway through the summer, I got notice from Region 3
19:42
in Albuquerque that I had a job offer.
19:47
I showed that to the ranger, and he said, "Oh, Mike, I
19:54
think we can get you on board here. Why don't we go in and talk to the
20:00
Supervisor's Office." We did, and they said, "Oh yeah, Mike, there's no need for
20:06
you to go down to Albuquerque. We can get you on." And they were able to get me on.
20:13
That was the beginning of my professional career, on the Willamette
20:19
at Lowell, the Lowell Ranger District.
20:24
The ranger there was Fred Brehm, part of the "old school." I don't
20:29
think he had a college degree.
20:32
What they used to call, the "life of hard knocks," or the "training through
20:36
hard knocks," or something like that.
20:38
Yeah.
20:38
That's what they used to call it in the service [military] , right?
20:40
Yeah, the "School of Hard Knocks."
20:43
Versus the educated guys.
20:45
Yeah, right.
20:46
And I'll never forget, here I am, 21 years old, wet behind the ears, and he's calling
20:52
me, "Mr. Kerrick." Mr. Kerrick, wow!
20:57
And I'll never forget his wife.
21:05
Fred worked for a while up on the Olympic [National Forest] , and
21:08
his wife, and I think was from the Olympic area, a neat gal.
21:13
But she smoked cigarettes.
21:16
And she would strike them, a farmer's match, you know, sulphur
21:21
on the shoe, and light up.
21:23
And I mean, the contrast between the two was pretty amazing.
21:26
They were both great people.
21:29
You know, the Forest Service back in those days were more of a family,
21:35
much, much more of a family than
21:39
they are now.
21:41
You know, you lived on remote stations.
21:43
And a year later, my wife and I were married.
21:50
You and
21:50
-- ? Sue.
21:51
Sue, yeah.
21:52
I brought Sue from the prairie land where you could see for miles,
21:57
miles, and miles, out here to Oregon.
22:00
Our first home was up Fall Creek, which was at the bottom of the canyon.
22:05
And if you could see 800 feet, you were probably lucky.
22:09
Anyways, the reception, you know, the women, the other wives,
22:14
took her under their wing, and
22:21
you can imagine, the contrast from the prairie to here, and surviving
22:26
that, you know, getting through it.
22:29
Now, I will return to the culture of the Forest Service a little later.
22:34
Okay, right.
22:34
But I wanted to address something you mentioned about the size of the trees.
22:38
I have two questions here.
22:39
You can go off how you want, and I'll take them one at a time.
22:43
How do you think the contrast between your home state and the Pacific
22:47
Northwest affected your views on managing coniferous forests that compose
22:54
a large percentage of the region?
22:57
In other words, the size, type of trees, the whole ecological dynamic out here?
23:05
Well, I mentioned earlier, when we were visiting at the spring quarter
23:11
of your senior year, you spent at Cloquet in kind of a practicum,
23:20
surveying and cruising and doing all those sorts of things.
23:24
In Minnesota.
23:25
In the swamps.
23:27
And of course, the spring quarter would be before the full-blown mosquito season.
23:35
But it became obvious to me that I'm not sure I want to practice
23:42
forestry wading through swamps and in the sphagnum all my life.
23:47
What they call peat bogs, right?
23:49
Yeah, peat bogs.
23:50
Right, yeah.
23:52
So,
23:56
I was interested in heading west.
24:00
What I found out in the West was certainly far more appealing than
24:05
what I had witnessed or experienced there in the swamps around Cloquet.
24:12
Now, that doesn't mean or
24:15
say that [phone ringing] there's not more than just swamps.
24:21
My experience canoeing, you know, in the back-country canoe waters, you had
24:27
the pine forest there, and uplands.
24:31
[Break in audio]
24:34
Continue.
24:35
We were
24:37
in the peat bogs or you were segueing to coming here.
24:38
Yeah,
24:43
part of the reason I think for going out west in '51 was to take a look at the rest
24:49
of the world, or the rest of the forest.
24:52
And what I found out here was certainly more appealing than the
24:58
little piece I saw in Minnesota.
25:01
Minnesota and Michigan and Wisconsin were the old railroad logging areas
25:09
where they would build railroads in and just blade everything.
25:12
Right, absolutely.
25:13
This was one of the sources of what became, shall we say, the intellectual
25:19
and cultural fermentation of early conservation, because of a lot of the
25:23
things that happened in that area.
25:26
Absolutely, yeah.
25:27
Now, what do you remember seeing of what was left of old-growth forests or what had
25:33
grown back by the time you were in your formative years, from those early, you
25:38
know, cut-and-run practices, shall we say?
25:40
Right.
25:42
In fact, that was part of the history and part of the interest really in
25:47
forestry, was to work the 3C activity and what-not, the reforestation, all of that.
25:47
The canoe country, I guess, some
26:06
of that had been harvested too, now that I think about it.
26:10
Splash dams and, you know, part of it anyway.
26:14
Are you talking about the canoe trip you took when you were 15 all the way down the
26:19
-- Well, the second one when I was 16 was up in the Quetico.
26:25
Okay.
26:27
But was that part of your training at Minnesota when, since you were right
26:32
in that area, and obviously they were teaching conservation practices as
26:38
they were interpreted at that time.
26:39
Forestry, through the lens of Gifford Pinchot multiple-use philosophies?
26:44
Right.
26:45
But did they use the Northern Plains examples as a case study of why we need
26:50
conservation and sustained-yield models?
26:53
Well, I'm sure they did.
26:54
I don't remember specifically that, but no question that they did.
26:58
And
27:01
the Minnesota School of Forestry, I thought, was a really great school.
27:10
Some great people came out of the university and it had
27:17
a great multiple-use ethic.
27:19
And it was the foundation for future learning.
27:25
The notion was that this isn't it
27:29
that education continued on, and continuing education was
27:35
important throughout your career.
27:36
Do you remember a particular professor or professors that had an especially
27:41
strong influence or impact on you in that period of your training in college?
27:46
Yeah, some of the younger guys.
27:48
Earl Meyer, as an example, taught a course in aerial photography.
27:57
But he was one of the younger ones, and was more of a forward-looking person.
28:02
Brownie, was the mensurationist guy.
28:07
And
28:09
folks made a lot of fun of Brownie.
28:11
But, you know, he covered the basic measurement principles and math
28:17
and so on that goes in to that.
28:19
It was important that we got that.
28:21
The dean of the school was a very, very key figure in terms of
28:30
motivation, and another hero figure.
28:33
What was his name?
28:35
Frank Kaufart.
28:37
And he was
28:38
-- How do you spell Kaufart?
28:40
K-A-U-F-A-R-T, I think.
28:44
Kaufart, yeah.
28:45
Kaufart.
28:45
Yeah,
28:48
he taught one of the introduction courses of
28:53
forestry.
28:53
I don't know if deans do that and if that's the typical place
28:58
of the dean to do, but he did a great job of it, as I recall.
29:03
I mean, my God, that was over 60 years ago, but I do
29:06
remember a fondness for Frank.
29:09
In fact, when I was on the Coconino [National Forest] , you know, many,
29:14
many, 50 years later, Frank was out, and this was when he was crippled, but they
29:24
brought him out to NAU as a guest speaker.
29:27
And I had the opportunity to spend a day with Frank on the "Coc." And one
29:35
of the early professors at Minnesota spent his early days on the Colorado
29:42
Plateau and on the Coconino, and always talked about his experiences.
29:46
So, it was really a special time for me to have Frank, at the end of his career, and
29:53
probably he didn't last many more years.
29:56
This would have been in '77-'78, sometime in there.
30:03
Just a marvelous guy.
30:05
So, anyways, those were the heroes of my college days.
30:13
I don't recall mentoring, per se, but
30:18
some of the folks, there were some guys in pathology that
30:25
were instrumental, too, inspirational also.
30:32
Now going to a more cultural question.
30:39
Obviously, the trees and the topography are much larger and bigger here.
30:46
How would you view the inspirational aspect of big geography and big trees
30:52
that you saw when you came out West, and how you just felt about this
30:56
place, the actual cultural place of Oregon, or the physical place?
31:00
Yeah, well, it was pretty amazing.
31:06
Those days,
31:10
this would be in the early '50s, and the Willamette had been, well,
31:17
you know, going back a little bit.
31:19
This is
31:23
the years just after the war.
31:26
Correct.
31:26
And the need for housing and the need for lumber was very strong.
31:34
And the national forests had been in a custodial state, you know, in the
31:40
'30s and, well, pretty much since the inception, with notable exceptions.
31:46
I mean, there were some early timber sales on the Willamette back in the '20s.
31:52
They established a mill over at Hines, I mean, at Westfir, you know.
31:55
It was a company town?
31:56
[Just west of
31:59
Oakridge]
31:59
A company town, right, yeah.
32:01
Anyways, so in the '50s, it was still just emerging as
32:07
a managed forest.
32:10
So, there were still vast parts of the forest that were intact.
32:15
And you know, you looked out on these
32:19
lands, the incredible scenery and so on.
32:24
Yeah, I was awestruck.
32:27
It was pretty amazing.
32:30
In fact, when you go back, and we had an annual yearbook
32:40
[reunion] , part of it was stories from the year before,
32:44
from students on student jobs.
32:48
I was in one of those and I remember
32:53
relating my experience in the West, you know, what was going on.
33:01
But we need to step back, and to think about the '50s.
33:09
It was a period of growth following the war.
33:18
Putting people back to work.
33:20
Getting housing, you know.
33:22
It's the "Baby Boom" era, too.
33:24
Yeah, it was the Baby Boom.
33:25
The demographics were exploding also.
33:27
So, the national forests were taking on some of that challenge of
33:34
providing lumber and wood and so on.
33:39
Congress was very supportive, and generally, the public was supportive
33:46
of forestry practices then.
33:52
So, anyways, I guess that kind of describes the cultural scene somewhat.
33:57
It was a busy, busy, busy time.
34:00
But in terms of the aesthetic, I'm using an art term.
34:06
How did you see the mountains, the forests, the valleys, the rivers at that
34:11
time, at a time when there were very few of the areas that were clear-cut, or,
34:16
I mean, there was still a lot of what we'd call old-growth forest out there.
34:21
Yeah.
34:22
And how did you look at that, just as like a piece of art, an aesthetic?
34:27
Yeah, well, beautiful, no question about it.
34:38
But it was also a commodity, you know,
34:46
where it was suitable for harvest, a commodity, and
34:52
the nation needed that wood.
34:55
I mean, that was kind of the mindset, as I recall.
35:02
Now, let's segue to the Andrews because I know you did some early
35:08
work that had to do with the Andrews.
35:12
What was your first task that was actually connected to the
35:16
H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest?
35:21
I think it was 1953, but we'll have to find out for sure if it was '52.
35:28
Okay?
35:28
I think so, but, yeah.
35:30
When the dedication took place, yes?
35:33
Anyways - [Dedication of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest was in 1953 to
35:34
honor Region 6 Forester H.J. Andrews, who died in a 1951 auto accident.
35:34
From 1948 to 1953, it was called the Blue River Experimental Forest]
35:35
We'll have to check.
35:35
Yeah.
35:37
Mike, you may be right, it might have been 1953.
35:39
Whatever year it was, the fiscal year in those years ended June 30.
35:45
And so when you arrived in mid-June or so, you were put into a lot of different
35:52
kinds of jobs because the timber funds had probably been pretty well exhausted.
35:57
The job you came out to do, like in my case, surveying, preparing
36:03
topo maps and contour maps, they didn't have money until July.
36:10
So, you did a whole number of different jobs.
36:15
Picking up rocks behind a patroller, maybe, and so on.
36:18
Anyways,
36:21
my first experience at the Andrews was prepping the site for the dedication.
36:27
We had some flagstones and there was this big rock there that
36:33
had the dedication monument.
36:35
I and the headquarters fireman, a guy by the name of Cliff Roberts,
36:44
went out to prepare the site.
36:48
We wanted to make it look natural, and we put moss back in between the cracks, and
36:54
all the landscaping, to get ready for it.
36:59
Now, where exactly was that dedication?
37:03
Well, it was right at the forks of the road, as I recall.
37:08
Down below, near the bottom of Lookout Creek.
37:11
Correct?
37:11
Yeah.
37:14
Just above the bridge.
37:16
But below where the campus [HJA headquarters] is today?
37:18
Oh, yeah.
37:18
Right, okay.
37:19
And to the right.
37:20
It was on the main Lookout Creek Road, just to the right.
37:25
I think it still is there.
37:29
Next time you're up, you'll have to take a look.
37:31
I believe so.
37:33
Anyways, that was the first experience.
37:35
Now, did you go to the dedication?
37:38
No, gosh, no.
37:39
I was a little seasonal employee, you
37:45
know.
37:45
The other thing we did was part of the layouts for the some of those early
37:54
sale units [In HJA] . The task for the Andrews at that point-in-time, was
38:02
how would you organize these old-growth forests
38:11
in such a way that best facilitated harvest and regeneration.
38:15
Converting those old-growth forests into young, vigorous stands,
38:20
which was held up as the model.
38:22
That was what we wanted to achieve, converting those big, old "biological
38:30
deserts." Can you imagine, we were calling them "biological deserts" at that time?
38:35
I've read the old literature, so yes.
38:37
That was the mindset.
38:40
And so, the Andrews' focus from the inception in '48 up through
38:48
quite a while later, was that.
38:50
How it eroded, how would you harvest it, what was the pattern, and so on.
38:57
And so, out of those studies, some of those early studies, came the
39:03
staggered setting system that we employed throughout Region 6 and I
39:08
think probably throughout the West.
39:13
I know at least my experience in northern California, that same pattern was there.
39:18
Where you would access, it would maximize the amount of
39:23
road with the amount of timber,
39:29
which would gain access for fire protection and for sanitation harvesting,
39:35
and maintaining a healthy, thrifty forest.
39:41
Now, the road systems, they tried different patterns and so on.
39:45
That was part of the
39:49
research that was going on there.
39:50
Did you help survey or put in any of the roads in the Andrews?
39:54
I don't recall.
39:55
I think so.
40:00
I did do some layout, some strip layouts, and some of those
40:04
little tiny circular things, some eighth-acre circular clear-cuts that
40:11
we would call gaps now, I think.
40:13
But in those days, they were just trying out different kinds of ways of harvesting
40:23
in order to obtain regeneration,
40:27
looking at it from a natural standpoint.
40:29
Natural regeneration, versus planting, and so on.
40:34
That was the early thrust of the Andrews.
40:36
The first surveys of sales would have been Watersheds 1, 2 and 3 or
40:43
-- ? Well, no, there was some earlier stuff than that.
40:45
Okay.
40:45
The 1, 2's and 3's, didn't happen until, oh, the fairly late '50s, early '60s.
40:56
No, some of the stuff up Lookout Creek on up towards Lookout Ridge were, and
41:07
some of the main roads up Lookout Creek were in place, but
41:11
prior to the watershed stuff.
41:13
Jack Rothacher designed that experiment.
41:20
Well, Roy Silen was the first person.
41:22
Yeah, Roy was the guy doing the harvest systems and the road
41:28
layout, that sort of stuff.
41:30
And then, Jack followed him and was more involved in, okay, let's see what happens.
41:38
Let's try to measure,
41:43
measure the impact of harvesting on other systems, on watersheds, on
41:51
water quality, and that sort of thing.
41:52
And so, the notion of the three-paired watersheds came into place.
41:58
Watershed 1, which was to be entirely
42:03
harvested.
42:03
Watershed 2 was the control, and Watershed 3 was going to be
42:10
the staggered-setting system.
42:14
And
42:17
I left, well, we've got a period there,
42:26
missing here.
42:28
In 1956, I moved from Lowell over to the new, brand-new ranger district, which
42:35
was just created out of the McKenzie.
42:37
Lowell was your first post-graduate professional position.
42:41
Right?
42:41
Yeah, right.
42:42
Your seasonal work, '51 to '53.
42:46
Yeah.
42:46
In there you were doing these different jobs, including the plaque on the
42:51
rock and the dedication ceremony?
42:53
[at the H.J. Andrews E.F.]
42:54
Right.
42:56
Continue.
42:57
So, my first professional job was at Lowell as a junior forester in there.
43:07
The training in those days was, you know, a whole bunch of
43:15
activities generally related to the timber program, like, the first year
43:23
there, because I had experience and they needed a type map prepared, my first year
43:34
was spent, the 1954 summer season, at
43:42
a mapping camp
43:45
up out of Fall Creek.
43:49
And foresters then,
43:52
you had to go through scaling, so I scaled logs.
43:56
None of this sounds real professional to me now, but it was part of the training.
44:02
And sale layouts, going out with experienced foresters and learning
44:08
how to prepare timber sales and locate boundaries and that sort of thing.
44:13
It was definitely utilitarian, economic-centered at that time.
44:16
Yeah, right, right.
44:17
Which is typical of the Forest Service at that time.
44:20
Yep.
44:21
And so, an opportunity became available in 1956.
44:30
In those days, you've got to remember that the selection process was a big mystery.
44:36
They maintained rosters, and you had folks who were kind of keeping track of
44:44
what your next career step ought to be, and so on.
44:48
At the time, there was the fire staff, a guy name of Jack Smith, who
44:53
is still alive, and he's in his, I think he's 100-and-some [age] now.
45:00
Thought that it would be good to get professional foresters
45:05
involved in the fire business.
45:11
Fighting fires?
45:12
But in fire management, the whole being part of the leadership
45:19
in that area, the area of fire.
45:23
And so,
45:27
these jobs had traditionally been open to technicians, non-professional types.
45:38
He created about three, he got approval from the rangers, and it was agreed to
45:47
place, I think there were three of us in the Forest [Willamette] at that time, Bud
45:57
Baumgartner, Lloyd Soule, and myself,
46:01
into these DA jobs, the district assistant, which was the old kind of
46:09
master of
46:13
all kinds of jobs.
46:15
The job I had; we had trail maintenance, road maintenance, and recreation.
46:21
Because I was a forester, I also had
46:25
reforestation, as well as the fire control aspects.
46:29
Back in those days, it was fire control.
46:31
You know, the objective was to jump on the fires and get them under control
46:37
before 10 a.m. the next morning.
46:41
But, the fire management, did it include thinning?
46:46
Did it include thinning certain stands, because they were too
46:50
bunched together, and obviously, a hot fire could get flared up?
46:53
No, that whole notion came beyond, much later.
46:58
Well, not much later, but later.
47:00
I can talk about some of the real basics of doing that on a
47:05
forest-wide scale on the Coc.
47:08
[Coconino N.F.] But anyway, no, it was basically fire, and we had lookouts.
47:14
I had five lookouts at Blue River.
47:21
They had an experiment going on called the "Increased Manning
47:26
Experiment," where the thought was, if we increased surveillance and
47:36
suppression forces, the increased investment would pay off in smaller
47:42
costs in terms of fire control.
47:47
The Willamette had instigated that.
47:50
We ended up with five lookouts, all
47:56
supplied by pack stock.
47:58
It
48:02
was interesting.
48:04
That was part of my job, maintaining the lookouts.
48:10
I had a radio and a No.
48:16
9 telephone line right into my house, so
48:22
I was available 24/7.
48:26
It was an interesting period.
48:31
My next-door neighbor in
48:36
1956 when we moved to Blue River, was Jack Rothacher, who was the scientist
48:42
there assigned to the Andrews.
48:45
We became friends with him and his wife.
48:48
And we did a number of social things together.
48:54
One project we did, well, we did a couple of projects.
48:57
One, in the control Watershed 2, we contracted with the research folks
49:08
to build a trail system down through, so they had access by trail for
49:14
various instruments and that sort of thing, throughout the watershed.
49:20
We brought in a couple of old loggers that could do wonders with power
49:27
saws and so on, and built that trail.
49:30
The other thing Jack and I did was,
49:37
the hydro-seeding on some of the cut-banks.
49:40
You know, and here again, this was in the early days of trying to stabilize
49:46
those banks with seed and straw.
49:49
Was
49:52
this the road cuts?
49:53
Yeah, road cuts, and trying various combinations of seed and
50:00
mulch and that sort of thing.
50:03
That was more, I guess, involved in the experimental business.
50:09
But beyond, as that watershed research continued on,
50:16
when I came back as ranger, they had, oh, gosh, I can't remember, I think they
50:21
were up into the teens, like Watershed 10, Watersheds 12, 13 [likely 9-10] . And
50:28
they were looking at different aspects of
50:34
monitoring and effects of timber management, and a very silvicultural-like
50:40
spring, that sort of thing.
50:42
One was called a "Chem-Shed" where they tried to monitor the effects
50:48
of use of chemicals and so on.
50:50
Herbicides?
50:51
Yeah, herbicides.
50:56
Well, I'm kind of getting off the track.
50:57
No, that's fine.
50:59
This is how this goes.
51:02
It doesn't have to be strictly linear and chronological.
51:05
However the memories are connected together, is often the best
51:09
way to do these things, Mike.
51:10
When I
51:15
left Blue River in 1959, that was about the time they were to
51:20
begin harvesting and designing
51:26
the experiments in Watershed 1 and Watershed 3.
51:31
So, I missed that whole thing.
51:33
There was a 10-year period when
51:37
I left and went up to northern Washington in the Mount Baker [National Forest] as
51:45
assistant ranger, and did a variety of things up there.
51:51
Tell me a little bit more about Jack
51:54
Rothacher?
51:55
Jack was a neat guy.
51:56
I think he, you know, I don't what his educational background
52:01
was, what kind of a degree he had.
52:04
But I think he came
52:08
out of the NFS, the National Forest System.
52:10
I think he was a ranger down in the Umpqua [National Forest] , and came to the job
52:18
as this early scientist on the Andrews.
52:25
He must have had some background in
52:29
watersheds, because that was his interest.
52:34
But he and his wife were both avid conservationists.
52:37
They were hikers, and I think belonged to the Mazamas.
52:43
I remember once joining them years later when I was at the Mount Baker, and we
52:50
skied together on Mount Baker, and we stayed in the Mazama Lodge up there as
52:56
a result of their being Mazama members.
53:04
An intellectual guy, a keen interest in this watershed stuff.
53:12
I guess, that's about all I can remember.
53:15
What do you remember about Roy Silen, other than what you already said?
53:18
Yeah.
53:20
By the way, he was the first permanent staff at what was originally the
53:25
Blue River Experimental Forest.
53:27
Blue River, yeah.
53:27
Which you mentioned, the H.J. Andrews dedication, in commemoration of
53:33
H.J. Andrews, who died in a tragic car accident in Washington, D.C.
53:39
Yeah, old "Hoss" Andrews.
53:40
He probably would have been Chief [U.S. Forest Service] at some point.
53:44
Well, I've heard different stories that when he was back there looking for a house
53:50
in Washington when the accident occurred.
53:50
Oh, okay.
53:51
And that he was being considered either for one of the senior research, the
53:57
top research position, or even chief.
54:00
[Being groomed for top position]
54:00
. Oh, really?
54:00
Or one leading to the other, and I've heard both stories.
54:05
Yeah, and I didn't know the guy, so
54:08
-- Yeah, well, but just
54:11
-- [Break in audio]
54:11
We're back on.
54:13
And we're continuing about Roy Silen.
54:16
Yeah, I met Roy a number of times.
54:19
I really didn't know Roy that well, but I know of the work that he did.
54:24
And that's about all I can remember.
54:30
Well, he left being in the field in '54, about the time
54:34
when Jack Rothacher took over.
54:35
Okay, yeah.
54:37
He met a woman in Corvallis and married her.
54:40
And decided he didn't want to live out there anymore.
54:43
Oh.
54:43
At least, that's the story I've been told.
54:45
Well, did he continue with the Station?
54:47
[PNW]
54:47
Yeah, he worked there for many years.
54:49
I think he was more lab-based, or over out of whatever the Forest Service Center
54:59
for Research was called in Corvallis at that time [Willamette Research
55:01
Center] , and that became the PNW Station Forest Lab that we have there now.
55:06
So,
55:11
I went up to the Mount Baker for seven years.
55:16
And after being there for a while, I thought, "My gosh,
55:22
I'm not progressing!" [Laughs]
55:24
Now, you left the McKenzie in what year?
55:29
Blue River.
55:30
Blue River, right.
55:30
Yeah, in 1959.
55:32
Okay, so you were here from 1956 to '59.
55:36
Correct?
55:37
Right, right.
55:38
And then you went to Mount Baker?
55:39
Yeah.
55:39
So, what did you learn up there that was added to what you had learned
55:44
in your early career down here?
55:47
How was the forest, the management and just the overall
55:50
dynamic, different up there?
55:52
Well, I was on the Monte Cristo Ranger District at Verlot.
56:01
And it was a hemlock forest, a climax forest with a few
56:08
remnant old-growth Douglas-fir.
56:11
But basically, fire had been excluded, you know, over time, that
56:17
the forest had progressed towards a climax of hemlock which came up
56:24
underneath the forest, and cedar.
56:28
Very, very little fire history, at least on the south end
56:33
of the forest that I was on.
56:37
We averaged, gosh, the first year we were there, we had 166 inches
56:44
of rain, that's 14 feet of rain.
56:46
[Laughs] We vied with the Olympic Peninsula with the amount of rain.
56:52
Now, was that close to, Monte Cristo is just south of Glacier Peak.
56:57
Right?
56:58
Yeah, the little town of Monte Cristo.
57:00
Right.
57:01
The ranger station was at Verlot, but the namesake for the ranger
57:04
district was Monte Cristo.
57:06
But were you close to what became the Glacier Peak Wilderness, or
57:10
-- ? No, we were west of it.
57:13
West, okay, right.
57:14
Yeah.
57:14
We were due east of Everett.
57:18
And if you remember the geology of northern Washington, and
57:24
the Straits of Juan de Fuca,
57:28
that flat place there, storms would come through and
57:34
we were on the storm track.
57:35
And as the storm climbs the mountain, of course, the rain comes.
57:41
As you approach Verlot, which was a little village with a ranger
57:46
station, there was like a rain cloud or a rain sheet crossed old Turlo
57:54
Creek, and from non-rain into a rain.
57:57
I mean, it was just amazing.
57:59
The snowpack must have been incredible?
58:02
Yeah, it was.
58:04
In the early '60s, we were kind of in that, near the end of that little
58:11
interglacial period, you know, where the temperature was cool.
58:15
And they actually developed a ski area, the base was at 3,000
58:20
feet, if you can imagine that.
58:21
That's quite low.
58:22
Yeah, pretty low.
58:24
And there was a chair-lift and so on.
58:27
It was on state park land.
58:35
As the climate warmed into
58:39
the '70s, they took the chair-lift down and that was it.
58:45
So, anyways, the learning period there was
58:54
how well we were converting those hemlock stands.
58:57
We were planting Douglas-fir back in.
58:59
But it was a whole different kind of
59:07
ecosystem.
59:08
More rain.
59:12
You've read here in the news here recently that the big slide at Oso?
59:18
Terrible.
59:20
And that
59:27
glacial phenomena permeated all of that country.
59:31
In other words, as the glaciers retreated, smeared clay onto the slopes, and so
59:38
you had to during road construction, get up through that layer of clay
59:44
as quickly as you could, in order to prevent landslides, that sort of thing.
59:50
Then you got into sand, and the best way to deal with sand
59:58
is to make it as vertical.
1:00:01
You laid it back, and it would erode like crazy.
1:00:04
So, as vertical as you could, was the way.
1:00:09
We had a road locator at the time, a guy by the name Ted Turner, who was a
1:00:16
technical guy, but knew the country.
1:00:18
And it was cliffy country.
1:00:23
He felt the best locations, most permanent location for a road, was to
1:00:31
locate it at, through the cliff, somehow.
1:00:33
And Lord, that was a different experience, too.
1:00:40
In fact, the whole challenge of roading in an unstable environment
1:00:47
was the challenge there.
1:00:52
And while I was there, we had a Wyssen operation, which
1:00:57
was the system that was used.
1:00:59
Which is the skyline?
1:01:01
[Wyssen Skyline - Swiss method.]
1:01:01
Yeah, the skyline with the yarder up on top, and you lowered the
1:01:07
logs down through gravity, and then brought the hooks back up.
1:01:14
And I'll never forget that, the American Gyppo, which was
1:01:20
a slang word for loggers, took
1:01:25
this finally-tooled Swiss machine, you know, and just would work the
1:01:31
heck out of it, and load it up with far more than it should have handled.
1:01:36
Because the Wyssen was developed by the Swiss.
1:01:39
Correct?
1:01:39
Yeah, it was a very, very delicate kind of thing, one of
1:01:46
the early full suspension things.
1:01:50
We were attracted because of being able to fly the logs without the
1:01:59
scarifying the soil and so on.
1:02:00
That was the way to do it.
1:02:05
Anyways, these guys would load the thing and break the machine down.
1:02:12
Now, just a quick segue to the situation up north, since you mentioned it.
1:02:18
Was the Oso landslide, in your opinion, caused by
1:02:23
land management practices, or just bad planning in where you
1:02:27
put houses in a small town?
1:02:29
A little of each, I think.
1:02:31
Do you think so?
1:02:31
That whole
1:02:35
country is landslide prone.
1:02:38
If you saw the photographs, it was classic, you know, just
1:02:42
one of these rotational slides.
1:02:46
You've got enough water and pressure, and "whoom," down it
1:02:52
came, and it turned to liquid.
1:02:55
Probably
1:02:59
harvesting, who knows, it probably had some connection.
1:03:03
Where the root system hadn't, there was no longer a root system up high,
1:03:06
to hold in, shall we say, the top part of the weight of that hill?
1:03:10
Yeah, I looked at the pictures.
1:03:12
That's why I was asking you.
1:03:13
Yeah.
1:03:14
But in landslide areas, I worked for a period down on the Six Rivers [National
1:03:20
Forest - California] too, which
1:03:23
that whole country is ancient landslide.
1:03:27
And that country up there, too.
1:03:30
If you look at, if you were a geo-,
1:03:35
whatever they call it, geotechnical guy, one who looked at landslide
1:03:41
topography, you know, that was classic landslide topography.
1:03:46
Some of it is stable in-between movements, but eventually
1:03:50
that stuff is going to move.
1:03:52
And so, placement of homes and the whole notion of zoning is important,
1:03:58
especially in that kind of country.
1:04:02
Wow.
1:04:04
Going back,
1:04:10
you'd been around the Andrews.
1:04:13
You knew what they were doing at that point.
1:04:16
Well, how did your understanding of experimental forests and
1:04:20
research natural areas evolve over the course of your career?
1:04:24
I mean, there's the Wind River up in Washington.
1:04:27
There's the Entiat as well and several others that developed, and the idea
1:04:32
of the research natural area kind of came during the course of your career.
1:04:37
What was your understanding of experimental forests and research natural
1:04:41
areas, and how did you see that fit into what you were doing in the Forest Service?
1:04:46
Well, I don't know if there was a clear connection.
1:04:49
I think we had a natural area, too, the Long Creek Natural Area
1:04:54
on the Monte Cristo District.
1:04:59
And there just wasn't any activity going on, on that particular natural area.
1:05:06
Although they had, there were some long-term progeny tests that
1:05:15
at one point in the early '60s, they tried to reconstruct those,
1:05:22
and if I remember, hunting for the aluminum tags and what-not.
1:05:28
It was a big sleuthing project.
1:05:32
Yeah,
1:05:35
as far as the experimental work,
1:05:41
we continued, some of the stuff we learned on the Andrews from the seeding
1:05:46
the cut-banks, we continued up there.
1:05:49
And that spread throughout the region, too.
1:05:52
And overall, what was your relationship like with the managers and researchers.
1:05:59
You were in the management arm with the science people and the researchers.
1:06:04
How did that change over time, especially as land management laws changed?
1:06:09
Yeah.
1:06:10
During your career, you went through the post-World War II age
1:06:14
to right into the environmental age?
1:06:16
Yeah, right.
1:06:18
Well, that whole era of the '70s where we had NEPA and ESA, the Endangered
1:06:29
Species Act, and Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, all of those
1:06:36
environmental acts, certainly had an impact, an incredible impact, on how you
1:06:44
documented your work, the analysis, and the science behind it, obviously.
1:06:55
And the Andrews of course, played a big role.
1:06:59
And I haven't got back to where I was ranger there, but when I was
1:07:06
leaving in 1970, going on down to the
1:07:13
Six Rivers National Forest, the Western Coniferous Biome was being
1:07:18
established there on the Andrews.
1:07:20
And
1:07:25
that was where a lot of the basic information was being developed,
1:07:32
you know, up into the canopies.
1:07:33
Gosh, we hadn't even thought about canopies until some of the work there.
1:07:39
And the discoveries of all of that stuff culminated in the LTER,
1:07:48
you know, the Long-Term Ecological Research, which grew
1:07:52
out of the Biome [IBP] program.
1:07:54
Exactly.
1:07:54
And into the late '70s and into the '80s.
1:07:59
Yeah, so that
1:08:02
I'm sure the environmental laws drove the budget and drove the money to go
1:08:09
into those long-term research things, which turned out to be very beneficial.
1:08:14
At the time, you wondered, what in the world are these guys doing?
1:08:19
This is not very helpful to us in the field, you know, crawling around there.
1:08:23
So, at first, a lot of the management types, you and your colleagues,
1:08:28
were looking at the research saying, "Hmm, why do we need to know that,
1:08:33
or that's just going to make our life more complicated," or any
1:08:37
number of thoughts along that front?
1:08:40
Maybe I had more empathy for that than others.
1:08:44
You know, I could see down the road, just because of the tie to the Andrews that
1:08:52
probably it was going to be beneficial.
1:08:54
But at the time, we had other needs too, you know, that were unmet and you wondered
1:09:01
about putting all that focus into that.
1:09:05
Yeah.
1:09:09
So, I don't,
1:09:14
you know, I came back as ranger in 1968.
1:09:21
To the Blue River?
1:09:23
To the Blue River, right.
1:09:24
And
1:09:26
those were the days when
1:09:30
Dick Fredriksen and, my God, who were some of the other guys there?
1:09:39
Ross Mersereau?
1:09:41
Well, yeah, Ross Mersereau was a neighbor.
1:09:45
You know, Ross, had nine children, if you can imagine.
1:09:47
And we had seven.
1:09:48
Did you guys ever have picnics together?
1:09:54
[Laughs] You need a lot of hamburgers for that.
1:09:56
Oh, my gosh!
1:09:56
We were next-door neighbors up on the tier above the highway there.
1:10:04
We were both on septic systems, and Lord...ay-yay-yay.
1:10:11
And Jerry Franklin was there, of course?
1:10:13
Yeah, I don't know where.
1:10:16
Jerry was probably up in the trailers, I would guess.
1:10:20
I think he probably had a
1:10:27
residence, maybe in Corvallis, but would spend, you know, the field time there.
1:10:33
There were a group of trailers up on, above there, that the district [Blue
1:10:38
River] had and the station [PNW] had, too.
1:10:41
And I'm sure Jerry was probably up there, yeah.
1:10:47
Anyways, that was another interesting period of development, and
1:10:59
my interest in research really grew during that period with a close relationship.
1:11:05
After you came back?
1:11:06
Yeah.
1:11:07
In '68 to
1:11:08
-- ? To '70, yeah.
1:11:10
I left in
1:11:14
October of 1970, and got on to Eureka and the Six Rivers
1:11:18
National Forest as timber staff.
1:11:22
That was still in the days when, you got a notice that, here's your
1:11:28
next job assignment, Mike, you know?
1:11:30
Like the military, right?
1:11:31
Yeah, right.
1:11:32
[Laughs]
1:11:32
Time to go overseas, right?
1:11:34
That didn't change until I went from the Six Rivers back up to, as deputy, on the
1:11:46
Mount Hood.
1:11:49
Still never putting in a vacancy notice, but getting a job offer, you
1:11:52
know, and you're expected to take it.
1:11:55
How did that work with so many children in schools?
1:11:57
Well, it was a challenge, yeah.
1:12:00
I mean, it was a challenge.
1:12:03
The kids had to move, they were upset, but then they made friends, and what-not.
1:12:10
When I went down to the Coc, I was selected the same way.
1:12:17
At that level, you had to have support from the chief's [Forest
1:12:20
Service] office and so on.
1:12:22
And
1:12:24
so, it's interesting.
1:12:26
It was only my last job when I went back to the Willamette as supervisor that I
1:12:30
actually put in a vacancy announcement.
1:12:34
So, in the '70s sometime, in the late '70s, they changed that
1:12:39
whole process, to where you put up vacancy notices, and if you wanted
1:12:45
a job, you put in for it and so on.
1:12:49
And in some cases, if you didn't want the job, they'd put you,
1:12:53
they had a....What was the term?
1:12:57
They selected to be sure that
1:13:01
some sort of an executive deal where you were required to put
1:13:07
in whether you wanted to or not.
1:13:08
[Laughs] I had to do one of those for a time or two.
1:13:15
Some other early folks, Forest Service people,
1:13:20
were Bob Auferheide?
1:13:22
Oh, yeah, yeah.
1:13:24
Phil Briglieb.
1:13:25
Yeah.
1:13:26
Dave Gibney?
1:13:27
Yeah.
1:13:28
These are some of the other mentors of yours, I believe.
1:13:29
Correct?
1:13:29
Yeah, Dave was
1:13:32
a mentor.
1:13:34
You know, in those days,
1:13:37
mentoring was kind of a..... I didn't realize Dave was a
1:13:41
mentor, but he obviously was.
1:13:45
He wasn't somebody that sat down with you and said, "I'm your
1:13:48
mentor," or anything, you know, but
1:13:51
-- But this developed naturally?
1:13:52
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:13:57
He selected me as district ranger at Blue River, and you know, he
1:14:02
really wanted me to go there.
1:14:06
This was in '68?
1:14:07
Yeah, '68.
1:14:09
Now, did you meet Dave before when you were here?
1:14:12
No, I didn't.
1:14:14
I left.
1:14:15
Dave came to the forest [Willamette]
1:14:20
about the time I was departing.
1:14:23
He arrived, I think, in 1959.
1:14:24
Now, Bob Auferheide, was he the district's
1:14:28
--? No, he was the forest supervisor [Willamette NF]
1:14:30
. Forest supervisor.
1:14:32
But he passed away when he was fairly young, if I read right.
1:14:35
Is that correct?
1:14:36
Yeah, he had cancer.
1:14:37
And,
1:14:40
let's see now, wait a minute.
1:14:41
Who was, did Gibney follow after?
1:14:44
I guess he must have.
1:14:46
Yes, he did, he followed.
1:14:49
Who was the boss up on the Blue River when you were there in the '50s?
1:14:55
Ed Anderson.
1:14:56
Ed Anderson.
1:14:57
He was the district ranger, and he was a mentor of sorts, too.
1:15:02
I learned a lot from Ed.
1:15:05
Some things not to do.
1:15:08
He didn't delegate very well.
1:15:11
But I learned, if you're going to develop a team, you had to delegate,
1:15:20
and let folks do, what they knew how to do best, and get the hell out of their way.
1:15:26
Now, what do you remember about the development of, let's say, this
1:15:29
portion of the Willamette from when you first came, until, let's say,
1:15:34
'70, before you came back again.
1:15:35
Yeah.
1:15:36
What do you remember about how many timber sales were going on?
1:15:39
Well, there was obviously the Army Corps of Engineers dam projects.
1:15:43
Yeah.
1:15:43
I mean, the face of the land changed dramatically.
1:15:46
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
1:15:46
Do you want to encompass that, encapsulate that a little bit?
1:15:49
Well, Cougar [Reservoir] , when I left in '59, Cougar was being cleared.
1:15:55
But the construction of the dam itself hadn't started, so all that happened.
1:16:02
Blue River Reservoir was being developed while I was on
1:16:11
as ranger.
1:16:12
And
1:16:17
they had an elaborate system to control the turbidity up there.
1:16:22
They were excavating material from behind the dam.
1:16:25
Right.
1:16:26
And screening it for placement in the dam, you know, and you
1:16:32
can imagine the turbidity there.
1:16:33
So, they had seven ponds.
1:16:35
I
1:16:38
forget what the number, the turbidity number,
1:16:44
that they couldn't release it until it cleared to that particular
1:16:49
number, which was still pretty murky.
1:16:50
Is that because it would have an effect on the McKenzie?
1:16:54
Oh, yeah.
1:16:54
The fish and all that?
1:16:56
Yeah, yeah.
1:16:57
But it was still pretty murky.
1:16:59
I remember the Blue River, when
1:17:05
we were there in the '50s, the swimming hole and a beautiful,
1:17:08
gorgeous, river, or small stream, with some great swimming holes.
1:17:16
When I came back in the late '60s during the building of the dam, it had
1:17:24
turned into kind of a murky, milky-looking, like
1:17:27
a glacial stream almost.
1:17:30
And when the dam was constructed, of course, it was ice-cold because
1:17:34
they took the water off the bottom.
1:17:35
So, yeah,
1:17:39
big changes.
1:17:40
And other changes.
1:17:41
Roading continued so that a lot of the district was accessible.
1:17:49
In fact,
1:17:53
but there was still road construction going on.
1:18:00
One of my first jobs when I came back as ranger was to
1:18:07
deal with the French Pete timber sale.
1:18:10
I was going to ask you about the whole French Pete-Olallie Ridge controversy.
1:18:16
Why don't you use this an opportunity to go into that story?
1:18:20
Yeah,
1:18:24
in those days, we pre-added sales.
1:18:32
You know, we were going to offer it in the spring, but you couldn't access
1:18:37
the area in the spring because of snow.
1:18:40
So, we'd pre-add them, add them in the fall, putting the various bidders
1:18:47
on notice that we were going to offer this in, let's say, April or May.
1:18:55
Here's an opportunity to go in, and take a look at your site and make your decisions.
1:19:00
We hadn't appraised it yet, and so on.
1:19:02
So, anyways, that had been pre-added and the Sierra Club, a local
1:19:10
chapter of the Sierra Club, appealed
1:19:15
the ad, and
1:19:21
that was
1:19:24
an open winter, very little snow.
1:19:28
And so, one of my jobs was to go in on snowshoe and take a
1:19:34
look at what it looked like.
1:19:38
And I did.
1:19:40
I and the TMA [Timber Management Assistant] at the time went in,
1:19:46
we were able to get into the units and take a look.
1:19:51
I was a little concerned, well, I was very concerned that since we had had an
1:19:57
appeal, that we ought to be sure that
1:20:04
we the correct layout, had met the standards of the time.
1:20:07
And then, to my horror, I found that the streamside strips weren't to the
1:20:14
standard that we had established.
1:20:17
The units had been laid out, I guess, several years before.
1:20:20
In the '50s probably.
1:20:21
Yeah, well, maybe.
1:20:25
At least, if not '50s, at least the early '60s.
1:20:30
And the roads came right up to the bottom of the creek.
1:20:37
Some concerns were there for landslides and that sort of thing,
1:20:39
and the impacts on the stream.
1:20:43
So, I told Dave, "Dave, since
1:20:48
we've been notified that
1:20:52
folks have concerns, I think we probably ought to pull the ad and
1:20:56
start over." And he had enough confidence in me, I guess, to say okay.
1:21:04
And you must have had enough sense that the growing environmental movement,
1:21:08
the ethos was changing, the culture was changing, and you could sense that?
1:21:08
Right, yeah.
1:21:14
Oh, yeah.
1:21:15
Right.
1:21:16
In fact, which gets us back into the mid-'50s when that whole, the
1:21:26
Three Sisters Primitive Area, this is before the Wilderness Act,
1:21:32
was being studied and looked at.
1:21:33
In fact, there was a thrust throughout the country to reclassify all the
1:21:41
primitive areas into the more stringent wilderness category under the
1:21:47
secretary's [Agriculture] regulations.
1:21:50
And
1:21:52
so, there was several different boundaries.
1:22:00
The one that the secretary chose was on Horse Creek, which released about
1:22:07
42,000 acres, more or less, on the western portion of the wilderness area
1:22:14
of the perimeter, into management, released it into management.
1:22:23
That was the site of the controversy?
1:22:24
Yeah, right.
1:22:25
And the Sierra Club never gave up.
1:22:27
I mean, they
1:22:30
were not, they did not like that decision.
1:22:33
This started back when David Brower was leader of the Sierra Club.
1:22:38
Right?
1:22:38
Yeah, probably.
1:22:41
Anyways, so immediately on that, the
1:22:47
district moved to, the road punched up East Fork, and then,
1:22:51
one came up along Horse Creek.
1:22:57
Well, by the time the '60s rolled around, the Sierra Club had had enough,
1:23:04
they decided enough is enough, and they were going to take some action.
1:23:09
There were also some local groups based in Eugene, if I remember right.
1:23:13
Correct?
1:23:14
Yeah, well, it was
1:23:18
the McKenzie Guardians, up on the McKenzie, part of that.
1:23:26
But yeah, Karl Unthank and Dick Noyes, they were all Sierra Club folks.
1:23:32
I think the local chapter of the Sierra Club was the focal point.
1:23:38
And Unthank was a professor at the University of Oregon, correct?
1:23:40
Yeah, and so was Dick Noyes.
1:23:46
And well, they may have been Obsidians [hiking, climbing, outdoor group] too.
1:23:50
I don't know.
1:23:52
Now, and I haven't been up there since I was in Boy Scouts, this reminds
1:23:57
me what would have been in question.
1:24:01
Were they in what you'd call the view-shed of the Three Sisters, or was
1:24:07
it more in a slightly lower valley?
1:24:10
Yeah, it was west of the Three Sisters.
1:24:13
But I mean, was the area of the cuts within the view-shed?
1:24:19
From the
1:24:19
-- Were you able to see from either place where the cuts would happen?
1:24:23
Probably not, not from the Three Sisters Wilderness, per se.
1:24:29
But they would have been,
1:24:34
and Dick Noyes and Unthank came up with their own name,
1:24:39
they called it an "intermediate recreation area," where it would be
1:24:46
more of a primitive, not a wilderness experience, but
1:24:51
they would allow tent camping and that sort of stuff.
1:24:54
Right.
1:24:55
And we countered with, we developed our own plan.
1:24:59
And you know, oh, dear, relocated the road up where it would be far
1:25:08
more benign, more environmentally safe.
1:25:11
It came up through the top of the valley and down.
1:25:17
Anyways, when I left in '70, it was still contentious, and it didn't
1:25:25
resolve itself, until I think Hatfield put it into, added it to the Three
1:25:32
Sisters Wilderness, or his proposal cleared the Senate and became law.
1:25:38
So, it was a period there during my stay from '68, '69, '70, wow,
1:25:47
countless tours into that area and all kinds of activities.
1:25:55
It was a growing period for me in terms of dealing with the public and so on.
1:26:01
So, how did you first of all, deal with the changing culture base where you had to
1:26:13
be more than a manager, even a politician,
1:26:18
as the environmental age came of age, the new laws came into effect with their
1:26:23
own mandates, but then you also had the grass-roots activism which raised
1:26:29
its profile and broadened its appeal?
1:26:32
How do you remember you adapted to that, struggled to adapt, and even
1:26:38
some of your colleagues, especially some of the older-school guys, and how
1:26:42
they dealt with that new thing where the old "get-out-the-cut," the old
1:26:47
multiple-use calibration was different or had to be looked as a different
1:26:53
political and cultural dynamic?
1:26:56
Yeah, in the '60s, I don't think we'd woken up to that.
1:26:59
I think we were still struggling with that.
1:27:05
And the worry then is,
1:27:11
you had this land base that the harvest schedule is based on, and yet you
1:27:20
were prohibited from entering some of those areas, but it was still in the
1:27:24
land base, so the cut didn't go down.
1:27:27
I mean, that was a terrible place to be in.
1:27:30
And that lasted for, boy, it lasted for a decade, even longer, until you
1:27:38
resolved some of those, resettled
1:27:43
the base, that you're operating under.
1:27:45
When you talk about sustained-yield, it's
1:27:51
based on an acre-volume harvest.
1:27:56
In other words, if you've got 1,000 acres and your rotation age is, say, 100 [years]
1:28:04
, from an acreage standpoint, you would probably be able to do 100 acres a year.
1:28:10
By the time you got to
1:28:14
the 100th year, you're back to where you, you know, blah, blah, blah.
1:28:18
That's the classic way.
1:28:19
So, the original cut was 100 years ago, and it's not old
1:28:24
growth, but it's pretty big.
1:28:25
Yeah.
1:28:27
So, anyways, that was a challenge.
1:28:29
And that was a struggle.
1:28:30
You had on one hand, this need, you had these targets to be met, and you had
1:28:40
a shrinking land base to get them off.
1:28:41
You know, it was just a frustrating, frustrating thing.
1:28:49
It was a tough time to manage is all I can say.
1:28:55
How do you remember dealing with the new political calculus, and not just that,
1:28:59
but the new time and labor management calculus, where you no longer focused
1:29:06
just on the economics of the old way of doing business, but there was all this
1:29:11
other stuff that came into your purvey?
1:29:14
Do you remember how you had to deal with that?
1:29:16
Well,
1:29:20
it wasn't easy.
1:29:23
I think
1:29:26
some of
1:29:28
experiences with that started when I came back as forest supervisor in the '80s.
1:29:36
That's when my sense was that this really was culminating.
1:29:46
We did all kinds of things.
1:29:48
We formed, were developing the forest plan [Willamette NF] . So you had an
1:29:53
opportunity to be able to make some changes, you know, in this forest plan.
1:30:02
Are you talking about the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:30:06
No.
1:30:06
Or the one even before that?
1:30:07
Yeah.
1:30:08
The one in '82, right, wasn't it?
1:30:10
Well, no, we finally got it in 1990.
1:30:15
But there were a series of forest plans.
1:30:20
There was one they adopted in 1974 which was based on the 1960 Multi-Use Act,
1:30:29
which required each forest, well, ranger districts, to develop multi-use plans.
1:30:38
The Willamette evolved that into a forest plan that was completed in 1974
1:30:44
when Zane Smith was supervisor.
1:30:46
And it was viewed as kind of the model of that period that addressed at least
1:30:56
to a modicum, the old-growth issue.
1:31:00
They'd set aside old-growth groves, and blah, blah, blah.
1:31:07
The passage of the NFMA, the National Forest Management Act of 1976, promulgated
1:31:14
a whole new approach to forest planning.
1:31:19
And that also included the roadless survey provisions, too?
1:31:23
Well, yeah, gosh, this whole thing gets complicated.
1:31:27
RARE I, RARE II?
1:31:30
RARE I was back in the early '70s following passage of the Wilderness
1:31:38
Act, the requirement to go take a look, and that didn't pass muster.
1:31:45
So then, in the '70s,
1:31:52
we did RARE II.
1:31:58
I was on detail as kind of the executive officer at the chief's [Wash.
1:32:04
D.C.] level, a long detail.
1:32:08
And I'm helping guide this national effort to be looking at things from the
1:32:15
RARE II perspective, which looked at,
1:32:20
RARE I. We made judgments, you know, if the road was there, you kind
1:32:26
of came into a finger, and, well, you'd whack that off, and RARE II
1:32:34
-- You couldn't whack things off?
1:32:36
No, you couldn't whack things off.
1:32:38
You had to do everything, even though it didn't make any sense to us.
1:32:42
So, that was the RARE II.
1:32:46
And it was different.
1:32:48
It was separate from the NFMA [National Forest Management Act of] , because
1:32:53
the NFMA regs, I don't think came out until probably '78 or '79.
1:33:00
So, the regs that were promulgated under the National Forest Management Act, they
1:33:07
were developed by the infamous Committee of Science, so it was science-driven.
1:33:15
That's what we were trying to implement in the '80s.
1:33:19
And frankly, the Willamette was not too excited.
1:33:23
We had a '74 plan.
1:33:24
We weren't too excited about getting into, you know, that's a pilot forest that we're
1:33:32
trying to get things out, kind of be the model on how to do it.
1:33:36
We said, "Nah, nah, we're comfortable with being the last one." But it took
1:33:40
a decade to get this dumb thing done.
1:33:43
And during that whole process, getting back to your question on how
1:33:47
you're dealing with the politics and so on, some of the initial things
1:33:51
that I did, we formed consensus groups and had a consensus weekend.
1:33:58
We'd bring,
1:34:03
the environmental activists and the timber industry, and the recreationists,
1:34:07
and whatever, "General Joe Blow," into a
1:34:14
week-long team-building session.
1:34:17
An intensive kind of formation of a group that could work together, not as well as
1:34:28
a well-functioning team, but at least have the basics of understanding one another,
1:34:32
you know, to work as a group, to look at
1:34:39
how they would want to
1:34:44
develop the forest into various land use divisions.
1:34:49
We did that in the south end and we had one up in the north end.
1:34:53
We had, I'll never forget, we had one of Hatfield's aides, a red-haired
1:34:57
guy, I can't think of his name now.
1:35:00
But we were roommates.
1:35:03
That's about as close as I ever got to a politician, you know.
1:35:08
Anyways, we formed one up there.
1:35:11
And they were successful to some degree.
1:35:14
In fact, my bargain was that whatever you guys come up with, whatever
1:35:20
you come up with, I don't care how far off the damn wall it is,
1:35:24
we'll put it in the forest plan.
1:35:27
Now, I won't guarantee it's going to survive the process,
1:35:30
but it'll go in the draft.
1:35:32
It'll be an alternative.
1:35:33
That's' my bargain with you.
1:35:36
And in most cases, they survived all the way through that whole process.
1:35:43
So that was at the beginning.
1:35:47
Then, we had a stall.
1:35:49
The timber industry just didn't like what was going on.
1:35:53
And this is the Reagan years, and they had enough power to suspend.
1:35:59
They suspended the planning process until, in their judgment, there was enough
1:36:06
technical information to move forward.
1:36:09
So, there was a pause, a planning pause, in the mid-'80s.
1:36:16
Once we got going back again, we still had this confrontational thing, you
1:36:22
know, I mean, it was still there.
1:36:25
So, I put together a group called
1:36:32
"The Fruitful Discussion Group."
1:36:34
That was the name, "The Fruitful Discussion Group?"
1:36:34
Yeah, fruitful.
1:36:35
God, I don't know, it was fruitful something or another.
1:36:39
Again, it was made up of the segments of the warring factions,
1:36:46
and yeah, it was an interesting time.
1:36:50
Here again, my hope was that they would help design some of the standards and
1:36:58
guidelines they were going to implement.
1:37:00
You know, this is beyond the land-use decisions, this is now into the standards
1:37:06
and guidelines we're going to drive how we operate under the forest plan.
1:37:14
It was pretty amazing.
1:37:17
The first meeting was going around the room talking about
1:37:22
yourself and introducing yourself to the rest of the audience.
1:37:29
There were probably fifteen, I think, probably something in that order,
1:37:36
people from all different persuasions, and they had to face one another.
1:37:41
They couldn't talk.
1:37:42
You had to listen what this one person was doing.
1:37:47
He talked about his life, his likes and dislikes, and his desires, all
1:37:53
those things that made him or her tick.
1:37:56
Because we had men and women, it was an amazing thing.
1:38:02
That whole process continued
1:38:05
two or three years as we were hammering out these standards and guidelines.
1:38:09
So, that was my approach.
1:38:12
And we had different forests that did different things.
1:38:17
But I tried to bring the public together, and
1:38:29
it was frustrating.
1:38:31
Because in the room, people were nice and decent and respectful of one another.
1:38:39
Outside the room, they would just go hammer and tong.
1:38:45
It's hard to name-call when you're sitting at a table with somebody.
1:38:48
Yeah,
1:38:51
it is.
1:38:51
That was, I think, a learning process for the folks at the table.
1:38:56
And
1:38:58
I think both sides gained some understanding.
1:39:02
Then, we finally delivered the plan in 1990.
1:39:07
And then, of course, it was short-lived.
1:39:11
The Clinton Forest Initiative?
1:39:13
[, led to Northwest Forest Plan]
1:39:15
Yeah, the Forest Plan.
1:39:21
That whole thing.
1:39:22
The Northwest Forest Plan.
1:39:22
Now, I'm going to segue from this question into where we just went from.
1:39:27
What were your first impressions of the McKenzie River Valley and
1:39:30
the surrounding region, and how did that contrast with locations,
1:39:35
other ones that you were located at?
1:39:38
And then, getting back to maybe the culture and the region of this place
1:39:42
and how it's adapted to these things that we were just talking about?
1:39:50
And you said you lived up by Jack Rothacher at the very
1:39:52
beginning, for instance?
1:39:53
Well, yeah.
1:39:59
Those were the early days, you know, in the '50s.
1:40:02
I don't think there was an as contentious an
1:40:09
environment as developed later.
1:40:14
What were the demographics up here?
1:40:16
Who lived in the McKenzie River Valley that you remember?
1:40:20
Oh, wildlife.
1:40:23
[Laughs]
1:40:23
Wildlife, yeah.
1:40:25
That wasn't the Cougar Room, Mike.
1:40:26
[Laughter]
1:40:27
Yeah.
1:40:30
Sorry.
1:40:32
Well, yeah, there were a lot of loggers and people who worked in the woods.
1:40:36
And yeah, there was that kind of an atmosphere.
1:40:41
The river guides, too.
1:40:42
Right?
1:40:42
Oh, sure, river guides.
1:40:43
Yeah, they were the river guides, they were a little contentious,
1:40:48
and that whole thing grew, too.
1:40:50
And as the environmental movement, you know, from the '50s to the
1:40:56
'70s, it was a humongous change.
1:41:02
The McKenzie Guardians were a force in the '60s.
1:41:09
They were appealing sales and concerned about this and that, and so on.
1:41:16
When do you remember seeing the shift between when the Forest Service was
1:41:21
"our friend," meaning the local, traditional land users, and "suspect
1:41:28
at best," if not their enemy.
1:41:31
How do you remember seeing that transition?
1:41:34
Well, somewhere in the '60s, I think.
1:41:39
As the various laws became on the books and more publicity about this,
1:41:45
and clean water, and blah, blah, blah, blah, I think that shift started.
1:41:49
Well, that was in the '70s, I guess.
1:41:51
Yes.
1:41:54
But it was beginning in the late '60s when I was ranger at Blue River.
1:42:03
How do you remember the difference between then and when you were a
1:42:06
supervisor in the '80s and early '90s until you retired, in terms of how
1:42:11
the local folks look at you guys?
1:42:14
Well,
1:42:20
the thing that's amazing,
1:42:24
is, well, each new ranger that came on with Randy Dunbar back in the early
1:42:32
'80s, a big hoorah, that was always the new guy on the block, that big
1:42:44
controversy.
1:42:45
In Randy's day, it was
1:42:51
some salvage or danger trees at the falls, at Sahalie Falls, that in
1:43:01
his judgment, had to be removed.
1:43:02
Well, my Lord.
1:43:05
Is that because they might have endangered the people on the trail?
1:43:09
Yeah, absolutely.
1:43:09
Or, well, this is at the viewing site.
1:43:11
And
1:43:15
so, he survived that.
1:43:19
The latest one of our current rangers, his first year,
1:43:28
the world came unglued on this timber sale that the focus was on trying to fireproof
1:43:37
the neighbors, trying to do something
1:43:43
so that they'd be in a more fire-safe situation, which blew up, and my Lord!
1:43:51
By now you have social media.
1:43:54
This became world-wide.
1:43:57
It had comments from South Africa and Australia and all around the world.
1:44:05
Anyways, the ranger stepped up to bat, had some meetings and so on, and this
1:44:14
year, he was voted as the Man-of-the-Year.
1:44:21
Can you imagine that?
1:44:22
A Forest Service Man-of-the-Year.
1:44:26
Unbelievable.
1:44:28
So, anyways, here's one guy that was able to turn that whole thing on its head,
1:44:34
but is still, appealing sales and into lawsuits and all the rest of the stuff.
1:44:36
It's
1:44:42
just become a contentious thing.
1:44:46
Compare the Willamette to the Coconino?
1:44:50
Obviously, vastly different ecologies.
1:44:54
But just for an obvious comparison, how would you compare them,
1:45:00
management-wise, ecologically, however you would want to describe that?
1:45:05
Well, politically and from
1:45:07
a social standpoint, some of those same things are going on
1:45:14
there for different reasons.
1:45:17
When I first arrived, there was a project that, timber activity had
1:45:28
gone on for years on the "Coc.," and there were old stumps out there.
1:45:37
Somebody came up with an idea, a scheme, to salvage those old
1:45:42
stumps and turn them into naval stores, turpentine and what-not.
1:45:46
Well, when I arrived,
1:45:50
that whole thing was down the road.
1:45:53
It was about to be awarded.
1:45:56
And suddenly, up sprang a
1:46:02
concern, and the group, called themselves SOS, Save Our Stumps.
1:46:08
[Laughs]
1:46:08
Were they Flagstaff-based?
1:46:11
Yeah, I think they were.
1:46:15
Well, you know, I don't know where they were.
1:46:18
But in the end, the whole project went down.
1:46:24
And where were these stumps in relation to the forest there?
1:46:27
l
1:46:28
Yeah, they scattered throughout the whole Colorado Plateau.
1:46:33
Oh, so it was wide.
1:46:34
Okay.
1:46:34
Yeah, and a pretty benign sort of thing, or at least, it was flat ground and
1:46:44
from an environmental standpoint, it was not a big deal.
1:46:48
But these folks got the Native Americans involved, and, you know, the stumps
1:46:53
suddenly became sacred, and ay-yay-yay.
1:46:56
I don't know if you were down in Arizona
1:47:02
in the mid-, well, late-'70s?
1:47:06
No, I had not arrived yet.
1:47:08
Okay.
1:47:09
But the local ski areas had been there for 40 years.
1:47:14
But I've studied the whole Snow Bowl controversy.
1:47:18
The Snow Bowl?
1:47:18
Yeah.
1:47:20
It was a small part of a chapter in my dissertation, so I know the story.
1:47:25
Oh my, doing public involvement with that.
1:47:29
Kachina Peaks.
1:47:30
Oh, Lord.
1:47:32
I and the ranger would go out to the Hopis, and put out a public notice,
1:47:40
and these medicine men, all gnarled up, with arthritis, hanging onto a
1:47:47
staff and pointing their fingers, and Lord, that was their sacred peaks.
1:47:53
You know?
1:47:53
Well, if I recall right, the compromise was that they had to stop so far
1:48:00
from the top of Mount Agassiz.
1:48:01
[nd highest of San Francisco Peaks.]
1:48:03
Well, no, we never went out.
1:48:06
Wasn't that the compromise?
1:48:06
No, we never went outside of the perimeter.
1:48:09
It was additional lifts within the permit area.
1:48:15
But anyways, the same people were upset.
1:48:20
Ay-yay-yay.
1:48:23
And the public meetings, I was a hearing officer at one of the public meetings.
1:48:29
And,
1:48:33
oh Lord!
1:48:34
Some woman was putting on a slideshow, and a guy from the audience came
1:48:39
over and slammed his fist down on the carousel, and said, "Those are my
1:48:44
slides. You can't use those." [Laughter]
1:48:49
We had a rupture right there.
1:48:52
Oh, Lord.
1:48:54
So, for different reasons, but controversy nonetheless, on how
1:48:59
people view managing their lands.
1:49:02
And you know, let's face it, these are their lands.
1:49:09
Why, thank you [to Mike's wife Sue for snacks and beverages].
1:49:11
Yeah.
1:49:11
Mike's wife, Sue,
1:49:16
is bringing over some crackers and cheese, so we're going to take a nibble break here
1:49:24
for a second.
1:49:24
Eating these crackers will come off on these microphones.
1:49:26
[Break in audio]
1:49:29
Mike, how did you initially define the multiple-use concept that has always been
1:49:34
central to the National Forest Service mission, and how has that changed over
1:49:39
the course of your career, in terms of how you calibrate that, not only
1:49:45
philosophically looking at things, but actually managing things on the ground?
1:49:53
We talked about that earlier.
1:49:57
The multiple-use
1:50:00
had a distinct timber component initially, as we were developing the forests.
1:50:08
Of course that
1:50:11
has changed over time.
1:50:13
And I'm not sure today exactly what's guiding the whole notion, other
1:50:23
than there's no question that water quality has become a big component.
1:50:31
The Endangered Species Act changed a lot of things, for good or bad.
1:50:40
So, it certainly has evolved over time.
1:50:44
There certainly was more focus on the environment,
1:50:50
although initially, we thought we were doing good things on the national forests.
1:50:56
We were far, far superior to what was happening in the private
1:51:01
sector, at least we thought so.
1:51:05
But that whole notion is, the emphasis on timber has certainly changed.
1:51:10
Now, kind of adding into this train of thought, what role did science initially
1:51:17
play in management for you, and as you became a more mature land manager with
1:51:22
more experience and more knowledgeable of science, even though that wasn't
1:51:26
your training, how did you fit science into your management decisions and
1:51:33
how you saw things going forward?
1:51:38
I think I can give you a couple examples, one from the early days.
1:51:42
Some of the things that came out of the Andrews had to do with the
1:51:47
boundary- location of sales to minimize the effect of blow-down.
1:51:51
As an example, those things were helpful.
1:51:55
As we were developing, and I'll skip forward 30 years, as we were developing
1:52:01
the Forest Plan, we actually contracted with the Andrews folks
1:52:10
on developing the standards and guidelines on hydrology and on
1:52:17
standards for water quality, that sort of thing.
1:52:21
So, the focus
1:52:26
changed.
1:52:28
Riparian standards, those things were developed by-and-large from
1:52:33
the group of scientists [led by Stan Gregory] at the Andrews, directly
1:52:37
for the Willamette National Forest.
1:52:41
There were some spinoffs, I'm sure,
1:52:45
region-wide as well.
1:52:49
We hosted
1:52:53
a regional team, leadership team, all of the forest supervisors and
1:52:58
the directors in the regional office, on the Andrews in the mid-'80s,
1:53:06
as a way of interacting with the scientists.
1:53:11
It was those sorts of activities that really changed, I think, over time.
1:53:16
And you know, I've kind of lost contact.
1:53:18
Well, I have lost contact.
1:53:20
I'm not sure what's going on now.
1:53:21
But when I was supervisor, we established a position that John Cissel
1:53:29
had, you know, as a liaison [U.S. Forest Service] with the Andrews.
1:53:36
And now, Cheryl Friesen has that job.
1:53:40
And why is that an important position in your view?
1:53:44
Well, it's handing off technology, developing ways at getting it in
1:53:52
at the management stream much, much quicker, than waiting for
1:53:59
other ways of doing it.
1:54:00
And probably more effective since you've got a management person, you know,
1:54:08
interacting physically with scientists.
1:54:11
I think that technology transfer probably is a little easier than not having that.
1:54:18
And somebody like Cheryl or John before her can also distill and clarify
1:54:25
complex scientific ideas to the manager.
1:54:28
Correct?
1:54:30
Probably, yeah, a little easier.
1:54:33
We also established a silvicultural position at Blue River that was
1:54:39
directly connected to the Andrews in terms of some of these things going
1:54:43
on there, the levels of growing stock studies, thinning studies done in the
1:54:55
late '80s and '90s.
1:54:57
Now, Vince Puleo, wasn't he a person in that position?
1:55:00
Yeah.
1:55:01
Well,
1:55:04
he might have been.
1:55:05
Yeah, maybe he was.
1:55:06
You know, Vince had some communication problems.
1:55:13
The guy that I'm thinking of was Jim Mayo, who was pretty effective in that position.
1:55:24
How would you describe the facilities, or lack thereof, at
1:55:28
the Andrews, when you arrived?
1:55:30
And just how did you see that evolve over the course of your experience,
1:55:35
even though you were obviously back-and-forth from different stations.
1:55:38
But you were here a lot, and saw the scope of that development.
1:55:43
Yeah, back in the early '80s, they
1:55:50
coined the term the "Ghetto in the Meadow" [laughs] which you probably heard.
1:55:55
Many times.
1:55:58
We had offered and
1:56:02
I think they accepted some surplus trailers
1:56:07
to our needs,
1:56:11
for their use.
1:56:15
Obviously, they needed more facilities.
1:56:20
So, I had Hatfield [Senator Mark Hatfield] on-site one time and they
1:56:24
talked about the "Ghetto in the Meadow," and he caught up on that idea.
1:56:29
They got some funding and really, today, it's amazing, you know,
1:56:34
the difference between what it was and what it is currently.
1:56:39
And I believe, Les AuCoin [Oregon Congressman] was the
1:56:41
one that really got the money.
1:56:42
[U.S. House controls the budget]
1:56:42
Oh, really?
1:56:43
Yeah, from the congressional side of it.
1:56:46
I think Hatfield had something to do with it, but Les AuCoin was the driving
1:56:51
force behind the major funding needed to build the campus they have now.
1:56:55
[Earmark on bill]
1:56:55
Yeah,
1:56:58
great.
1:56:59
What was it like when you first got here?
1:57:01
Where did people live?
1:57:02
There was housing in Blue River and a ranger station.
1:57:07
Yeah.
1:57:08
Was there a trailer up there?
1:57:10
Yeah, there were trailers.
1:57:11
When I was ranger, there were trailers, they were at a trailer court in
1:57:17
the late '60s.
1:57:20
I don't think there was anything other than Jack Rothacher's house,
1:57:26
initially in the '50s, I can remember.
1:57:31
There was a warehouse up there at one time, too, I think,
1:57:33
before there was housing?
1:57:36
[Early 1970s]
1:57:38
Up on, at Blue River or
1:57:40
--? Up at the Andrews.
1:57:42
Well, yeah, there probably was.
1:57:44
But eventually, they developed a small lab facility down at the Blue River
1:57:48
[Near Blue River District Ranger Station, in town of Blue River] . Correct?
1:57:50
Yeah, they did, right.
1:57:51
That's what I thought.
1:57:52
Yeah.
1:57:55
Now, you already talked about it a little bit, but what were some of the important
1:57:59
scientific discoveries at the Andrews that you knew of or found out about during the
1:58:08
course of your management, that you had to incorporate into what you were doing?
1:58:13
One of the examples I've given lots of times, and others
1:58:16
have, too, is that in the '80s,
1:58:22
the findings about the need for large woody debris, not only terrestrially,
1:58:29
but also within the aquatic ecosystem.
1:58:35
Almost overnight, we changed
1:58:40
standards on the forest.
1:58:44
Up until that time, we were "yumming and pumming," which was yarding
1:58:49
unutilized material into piles,
1:59:01
and if the market was up, it would get utilized.
1:59:04
If the market wasn't, they'd burn it.
1:59:06
You'd burn it?
1:59:06
Yeah.
1:59:08
And which was a cost.
1:59:12
And
1:59:16
so, you eliminated that cost and there was an environmental reason for
1:59:22
doing it, too, it was a win-win deal.
1:59:25
So, you were aware of when Mark Harmon's work started on cutting the
1:59:29
logs down to see what happen over time?
1:59:32
Yeah.
1:59:32
Do you remember making that or providing bureaucratic support for that decision?
1:59:38
I told him, you ought to have some kids, some boys that would continue on.
1:59:45
Yeah, a 200-year study.
1:59:47
That's a little aggressive.
1:59:50
But it's still going on as far as I know.
1:59:56
But in terms of Harmon's studies, and the idea of woody debris and even going back
2:00:02
to something you started the interview with, where you mentioned how we saw the
2:00:07
old-growth forest as "biological deserts."
2:00:10
Yeah.
2:00:11
To where the real, the whole ecosystem chemistry over time
2:00:17
dynamic, wasn't understood by a lot of people, even scientists.
2:00:21
Yeah, right.
2:00:21
But certainly, by land managers, you just didn't see it that way?
2:00:26
No, right.
2:00:27
And now with the whole onset of climate warming and carbon sinks, that sort of
2:00:35
thing, it's taken on a whole new role.
2:00:42
Very positive.
2:00:44
So, you obviously became more familiar with the Andrews and the Andrews science
2:00:49
as it became much more sophisticated and moved to the IBP and the LTER
2:00:54
programs, which were 34 years to now,
2:01:03
how often did you see their studies having utilitarian uses for you,
2:01:09
the manager, and how many times was it just science to do science?
2:01:14
Or did you ever have a reflection on that about what was useful?
2:01:18
Well, I don't know.
2:01:21
I can't comment on that, I don't think.
2:01:25
Some of it was science just for science.
2:01:28
But, who knows what can come out of that?
2:01:34
Now, what do you think the partnership with land managers gave
2:01:39
the H.J. Andrews research community?
2:01:41
In other words, looking at it the other way?
2:01:47
Hopefully, it gave them some pride that their information
2:01:53
was being handed off and used.
2:02:00
I relate back when I was on the Coconino.
2:02:03
We had the Beaver Creek project there which dated quite a ways
2:02:08
back, again, into the '50s.
2:02:12
And the focus there was watershed,
2:02:17
but a little different twist, you know, in the arid Southwest.
2:02:19
It was how can we produce more water off these lands, you know?
2:02:25
And so, cutting the timber to produce more water was
2:02:30
-- So, in other words, speed the runoff up, right?
2:02:32
Yeah.
2:02:32
Exactly.
2:02:33
Was the notion.
2:02:34
But those guys produced very little.
2:02:40
You know, they collected data and collected data and collected data.
2:02:45
And
2:02:48
so, it's not very useful if you can't turn that data into something that
2:02:56
either guides or supports what you're doing, or suggests that you change.
2:03:03
So, science for science's sake,
2:03:08
I don't know.
2:03:10
It's got to have some utilitarian value.
2:03:13
And it probably will.
2:03:15
I mean, basic science certainly has proven beneficial.
2:03:27
Now, regarding the Andrews, OSU and the Forest Service, do you think the
2:03:32
local citizens saw these institutions, especially later in your career, as
2:03:41
kind of representatives of the urban educated elite that maybe was not in
2:03:47
tune with their needs, or do you think they came around to understanding that?
2:03:52
And I understand there's a diversity within the local community,
2:03:56
especially in later years.
2:03:57
You know, I don't know.
2:03:59
I saw that question and I don't have a reaction.
2:04:04
I mean, you live here in the McKenzie River valley, you're still a ways below
2:04:10
the Andrews, but, you know, going up the valley, how have you seen the demographics
2:04:16
and the society change over the years?
2:04:18
Well, it's become older, you know, the high schools have
2:04:22
shrunk in size and population.
2:04:25
Our church community has grown older with bluer hair, you know?
2:04:31
[Laughs]
2:04:31
Right.
2:04:32
So, that's kind of been the demographics.
2:04:34
It turned into more and more and more a retirement community.
2:04:42
Not totally, but I mean, compared to what it was,
2:04:49
that demographic has certainly changed.
2:04:51
And
2:04:54
how that impacts the Andrews, I really don't know.
2:05:00
I would guess if you asked most people on the street if they knew
2:05:05
about the Andrews, they'd say, no.
2:05:08
That's my perception, you know, is that they're the nerdy
2:05:13
scientists up on the hill.
2:05:15
I don't know what they think, or they don't even know about it at all.
2:05:18
Because back in the day,
2:05:22
obviously going way back, people like Jack [Rothacher] and other people,
2:05:26
even into the '60s and probably '70s, they lived in Blue River or close to,
2:05:30
and there was more of an interface.
2:05:32
Now, I don't think anybody lives in, well, maybe, actually, some of
2:05:36
their daily, they're what you call classified staff, the administrative
2:05:40
staff, a couple of them live down in the community around that area.
2:05:45
Yeah, Keable [Kathy, H.J. Andrews administrative staff]
2:05:47
. Yeah, Kathy Keable and her assistant.
2:05:49
But it's not quite like before.
2:06:01
In your opinion, what are the responsibilities of the land
2:06:03
managers as they relate to important scientific findings, even if they
2:06:08
result in difficult management challenges and political problems?
2:06:12
The obvious example would be the spotted owl, but you know, the whole old-growth
2:06:17
dynamic which is closely related to that?
2:06:23
Yeah, what was the lead-in again on that?
2:06:25
I'll read it again for the record here.
2:06:27
What are or were the responsibilities of the land manager as they relate to
2:06:33
important scientific findings, even if they could result in difficult management
2:06:38
challenges and political problems, the spotted owl being the most obvious?
2:06:45
Well, I can relate a little, you know, the progression over time.
2:06:53
I was on the Mount Hood when, this would be in '74 or '75,
2:06:59
and at that point in time,
2:07:05
each spotted owl nest was allocated, say, 50 acres.
2:07:10
And reaction was, wow, 50 acres for an owl!
2:07:14
So,
2:07:17
anyways, progress from that to
2:07:21
300 acres to whole huge conservation areas that encompassed, well, like
2:07:33
Lowell, 50 percent of the district was wrapped up in a spotted owl area.
2:07:45
Yeah, those were difficult times, I think, there to rationalize.
2:07:51
They kind of eased into it from 50 to 300, suddenly, with the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:07:57
Aren't there like 500 or 1,000 now?
2:07:58
[acre-size for spotted owl reserves]
2:08:01
Well, more than that.
2:08:01
I mean, there's some.
2:08:06
I think the Northwest Forest Plan varies, but on this forest, there
2:08:14
were very, very large areas.
2:08:18
So,
2:08:21
Judge Dwyer's decision came down about the moratorium on timber
2:08:27
sales on logging when you were at the end of your supervisor stint.
2:08:31
Right?
2:08:32
Well, I think I was already gone.
2:08:35
You were?
2:08:36
I think, yeah.
2:08:37
I forget what year that was, probably '92.
2:08:40
'91.
2:08:40
Was it in '91?
2:08:41
That's why I asked.
2:08:42
I knew you retired in '91.
2:08:43
Well, I retired in January of '91, so I think it was after that,
2:08:45
which really put the crunch on.
2:08:45
So,
2:08:55
you know your friends and colleagues, how have they dealt
2:08:59
with that issue since you retired?
2:09:05
Well, the Northwest Forest Plan kind of took care of that, I think, didn't it?
2:09:09
Yeah.
2:09:11
But,
2:09:13
you had a question about the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:09:21
Here we are 20 years later, the spotted owl populations are down, it's not
2:09:27
habitat-driven, it's the barred owl.
2:09:31
And what surprises me is that somebody didn't see that issue.
2:09:38
I mean, the barred owl has made its way out here as early
2:09:45
as the late '50s, I think.
2:09:49
So, by the '90s, it seems to me that there could have been somebody wondering,
2:09:56
well, what's going to happen here.
2:09:58
But it never came up, as far as I know.
2:10:03
So, here we are 20 years later.
2:10:05
How do you feel about the progress, the performance, of the Northwest Forest Plan?
2:10:11
Not very good.
2:10:13
You know, the timber targets were never met.
2:10:18
The environmental folks never went away.
2:10:24
What, I'm trying to think, was the special areas set aside?
2:10:27
One just here adjacent to the Andrews, where they were to
2:10:32
experiment with different uses.
2:10:35
There was a name for that and category of land [Adaptive Management Area] . The
2:10:39
other were the matrix lands that were open to timber sales and that sort of thing.
2:10:47
And the environmental community never stopped appealing or going to court.
2:10:52
So,
2:10:55
after a while, the Forest Service just gave up.
2:11:00
The folks in charge of the budget said, "Why should we send you
2:11:04
money, you can't produce?" Yeah,
2:11:09
I don't think it's been a success at all in terms of meeting the
2:11:12
goals that were established.
2:11:16
I don't know what if any of the goals were met.
2:11:19
Do you think the Willamette National Forest is any different than any
2:11:23
other forest in the Northwest or it's pretty much the same formula?
2:11:29
In terms of?
2:11:30
Dealing with the [Northwest] Forest Plan and what you're saying.
2:11:33
I have no idea.
2:11:34
But, what I'm saying is that
2:11:40
the "guaranteed"
2:11:43
timber outputs were never met, and the recovery of the spotted owl
2:11:49
certainly hasn't been achieved.
2:11:51
It's not habitat, it has to do with this competitive cousin, the barred owl.
2:11:59
I don't know, here we've got the Fish and Wildlife Service playing God [by listing
2:12:05
species under ESA] . They're going to
2:12:08
kill off the owl, the barred owl.
2:12:13
To me, that's what's wrong with the Environmental Species Act, too.
2:12:16
It's so single species.
2:12:18
You mean, the Endangered Species Act?
2:12:19
Endangered Species, yeah, Endangered Species.
2:12:21
Right, right.
2:12:21
Single species, so
2:12:25
you sacrifice one for the other.
2:12:27
Good Lord, I don't know, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
2:12:33
But there it is.
2:12:35
And it's been argued and argued and argued, and it hasn't changed,
2:12:42
what, in 40 years?
2:12:46
Continue, Mike.
2:12:47
Well, we talked about NEPA, and NEPA is
2:12:54
a good law and I would agree with that.
2:12:56
You know, we should be transparent with the decisions, but over
2:13:01
time the bureaucracy creep is
2:13:07
just incredible.
2:13:08
I mean, I don't know how many times we have
2:13:14
to reinvent the analysis, after a thousand projects, let's say, that are very
2:13:22
similar, and you still have to go through the same rigorous process, which had
2:13:28
turned out to be initially maybe a 10-page thing, has turned into a 50-page thing.
2:13:34
To a 500-page thing?
2:13:37
All about a similar project, and I don't think the project has improved.
2:13:41
That's the problem, the project still gets done, maybe, and the consequences
2:13:47
are the same, whether it's a 10-pager or a 500-pager, but the cost to the
2:13:52
taxpayer is incredible over time.
2:13:56
And I don't know how in the world they deal with that.
2:13:59
How much time, approximately, would you guess was spent by you and your
2:14:05
staff, and not just at the Willamette, but in the 20 years since NEPA was
2:14:09
passed until you retired, went into dealing with all of that stuff?
2:14:14
Yeah.
2:14:15
And what was the calculus, how much time did it increase the
2:14:19
burden on your staff over time?
2:14:22
Oh, you know, I don't have.
2:14:25
Well, just generalize about the dynamic.
2:14:28
Well, it doubled, I'm sure, maybe tripled.
2:14:31
Well,
2:14:35
infinitely, I guess, back in the days when we didn't do anything,
2:14:39
just went out and did it.
2:14:41
And the consequences, I don't know, well, if they are any better.
2:14:47
But I don't know exponentially whether they're that much better.
2:14:51
Do you have some memorable public hearings or not memorable, shall we say?
2:14:57
Where you had to before the public in one of these Q&A's based on
2:15:02
what you were doing or either to answer to the public comments?
2:15:06
One that I remember
2:15:11
very, very vividly is
2:15:15
one,
2:15:18
probably in the late '80s sometime.
2:15:21
I was invited down to
2:15:26
be queried by a couple of folks in one of those yurts or tents on the plaza there
2:15:34
at the old federal building [Eugene] . This was a natural spot for protestors.
2:15:41
So, I went in there and the first question asked was, "Well, when you retire, who
2:15:48
are you going to work for?" You know, number one, I had no idea, no intention
2:15:56
of retiring for many, many years.
2:15:59
And I had no idea that I was going to work for anyone, you know.
2:16:03
But that was the revolving door question that
2:16:06
-- Like, are you going to be lobbyist for the timber industry?
2:16:08
Yeah, right, absolutely.
2:16:11
That's what they were hoping to hear, you know.
2:16:13
Oh, really?
2:16:14
Yeah.
2:16:14
Well, I would guess, ridiculous.
2:16:18
Yeah, well, that was kind of the bottom.
2:16:29
Now, going to, shall we say, progressive forestry, however
2:16:33
you want to describe that.
2:16:34
Of course, Jerry Franklin, being the most famous scientist coming out
2:16:39
of the Andrews, what do you think about what is called New Forestry, of
2:16:44
which he's one of the more well-known proponents and some might even say, the
2:16:49
creator of that new model or paradigm?
2:16:54
Well, I have some trouble with it.
2:16:57
He subscribes to the need, and I certainly support that for
2:17:05
early seral development.
2:17:09
In other words, we need to have a young forest out there.
2:17:14
Not for owls, but for other creatures, you know, deer and elk and that sort of thing.
2:17:20
And birds, a lot of birds require that early seral-brush combination.
2:17:28
Now, my concept of that would be to act
2:17:33
quickly as possible, get that back into the forest.
2:17:37
But that's not his.
2:17:39
He thinks that the
2:17:44
longer you can keep it, well, not longer, but I mean, let natural things happen,
2:17:53
and I have some concerns about that.
2:17:56
And I guess the balance is economics, and
2:18:02
what the forests are to be used for.
2:18:04
But
2:18:07
we talked about, at one of the sessions I was at where he was
2:18:12
explaining this New Forestry,
2:18:16
he said he had to compromise somewhat with the BLM, because they
2:18:21
just couldn't go with this 20 or 30-year period of letting it evolve.
2:18:27
And so, he kind of compromised his views
2:18:33
into allowing for a shorter period.
2:18:35
But anyways, I think,
2:18:41
there's lots of ways to skin the cat.
2:18:43
And I don't know if there's a perfect answer in any of it, and I
2:18:50
don't know if we're smart enough to know, for sure, what's the best way.
2:18:57
One thing I notice, just since I've gotten into this project, and I keep
2:19:04
an eye on the different clear-cuts and different areas that have been cut up
2:19:08
around this area; what is the reasoning when an area doesn't get replanted
2:19:14
and it's still obviously just barren, after gosh, who knows how many years?
2:19:20
Why would that be?
2:19:21
They're violating the law, you know.
2:19:25
That's what I thought.
2:19:26
If that's the answer, they're violating the law and they should be prosecuted.
2:19:30
But who is violating the law?
2:19:31
Well, the landowner.
2:19:32
The landowner is,
2:19:34
by law.
2:19:35
You're talking about private land?
2:19:36
Yeah, private land.
2:19:38
I'm talking about Forest Service.
2:19:39
Oh, well.
2:19:42
I see a lot of them that aren't replanted for a long time.
2:19:44
Really?
2:19:45
Yes.
2:19:45
Well, it takes a while, you know, to seed these.
2:19:48
Is that because on certain northern or southern slopes or
2:19:52
grades, they have trouble stocking
2:20:00
growable seedlings, and making that system return?
2:20:03
Well
2:20:04
-- Or is there neglect in terms of companies that were supposed to replant areas
2:20:11
that were harvested, not following through on their end of the contract?
2:20:15
Well, from the private standpoint, I mean, if it were private land,
2:20:19
you are violating a state law.
2:20:21
Right.
2:20:21
But on National Forest land, you know, go way back into the early '50s, again,
2:20:31
we had some trouble understanding exactly what it took to regenerate,
2:20:38
and we had some failures.
2:20:40
Which is going back to the Andrews' original mission, regeneration
2:20:44
studies was one of their charges.
2:20:45
Yeah.
2:20:45
Right, seeing what
2:20:46
-- But this had more to do with nursery practices.
2:20:50
Right.
2:20:51
And the care you took of seedlings.
2:20:54
Once it's lifted and shifted, and once it got to the national forest, how it
2:21:00
was stored and then put into the ground.
2:21:03
And we solved that.
2:21:05
By the time
2:21:08
I came back on the [Willamette] forest
2:21:12
in 1980, we were having 90 percent success, 95 percent
2:21:17
success, every generation.
2:21:19
So, I don't know, if they lost something since then.
2:21:23
How did you try to match a particular hillside, like right here, this.
2:21:28
How old are these trees above your house here, about
2:21:31
-- ? About 35 years.
2:21:31
Thirty-five years, and those are almost all Doug Fir, aren't they?
2:21:35
Yeah, I'm sure probably, the big bulk.
2:21:39
There are some hardwoods in there, and there's some
2:21:41
hemlock, but mostly Douglas-fir.
2:21:43
And how would you match when you're doing a replant, how would
2:21:47
you match that area based on elevation, with like trees around it?
2:21:52
Would you mix up the seedlings, or did you monoculture it or did that
2:21:56
change over the time of your career?
2:21:58
Well, it's changed.
2:21:59
I mean, the stuff that's happening now, or at least when we were
2:22:03
still doing active logging, and I have no idea what's going on now.
2:22:10
But yeah, the standard had changed where you were mixing hemlock and fir.
2:22:17
And in fact going in with some of the precommercial thinning, you know,
2:22:23
opening up the stand and planting some hemlock scattered throughout, to more
2:22:28
duplicate what was in the natural stand.
2:22:31
So, don't monoculture it?
2:22:33
Yeah.
2:22:34
Because, you would agree that monoculture would be more prone to disease, right, or
2:22:39
-- ? Yeah.
2:22:39
Or, if you didn't pay attention to where the planting stock was
2:22:42
coming from, the progeny, all of those things, were important.
2:22:49
You know, some of the early progeny
2:22:54
studies back in the '20s indicated, you couldn't move the stock
2:23:02
from very far, laterally or longitudinally, or elevation-wise.
2:23:08
You had to stay within limits and that's pretty well-settled
2:23:13
science, I think, since the '60s.
2:23:17
You try to put the trees back that were close to the site.
2:23:23
But I can't respond to your question about national forest land.
2:23:29
I see hillsides, national forest hillsides, that just appear to not be
2:23:34
getting replanted in a timely fashion.
2:23:36
And that's what I'm asking you about.
2:23:40
What would be a reason for that not happening?
2:23:42
I have no idea, yeah.
2:23:46
In fact, I don't know.
2:23:48
I'm not saying that this happened.
2:23:49
The only thing that I could say is that's been a frequent criticism, but
2:23:56
basically, it's that people haven't gotten on the ground and taken a look.
2:24:00
Some of these little seedlings, it takes a while for them to show up.
2:24:04
Right.
2:24:04
But after several years, I mean, you should be able to see it.
2:24:06
That's what I'm asking.
2:24:07
I'm trying to become more educated about that myself.
2:24:11
That interests me greatly.
2:24:14
Mainly from the erosion control and runoff perspectives, as well
2:24:20
as aesthetics and appearance.
2:24:21
Because most people, you see carved-up hillsides, it
2:24:26
doesn't really look that good.
2:24:27
That's not really my question.
2:24:30
One stand down here, I notice is mostly hardwoods.
2:24:33
And I don't understand, somebody dropped the ball on that one, too, it seemed to
2:24:39
me because that's not a hardwood stand, It'll eventually come back into hardwoods.
2:24:45
No, I mean, into conifers at some point.
2:24:50
We didn't talk about the early loggers met when you were up there.
2:24:57
I know you and Ed Anderson in part of a previous interview that led into your solo
2:25:04
interview [both by historian Max Geier] , you talked about some characters you met.
2:25:09
Going back to the beginning chronologically, do you want to mention
2:25:13
a few things about some of those folks?
2:25:15
Yeah, Mike Savelich is one we talked about.
2:25:18
Mike was a Croatian, and he brought in a crew of Croatians.
2:25:29
And he did some good work up on the Andrews.
2:25:33
He did a lot of the early salvage logging, primarily, and some in a lot
2:25:40
of the scientific, some of the unusual, those little round units and so on.
2:25:46
He was the successful bidder on those.
2:25:49
The other guy we talked about was, oh, God, what was his name?
2:25:52
Balsiger?
2:25:52
Yeah, Balsiger.
2:25:53
Balsinger.
2:25:58
Yeah, George.
2:25:58
And he was a guy that, although I wasn't around, I know he was the guy that
2:26:05
successfully got the large Watershed 1 sale, and he ran the Wyssen system.
2:26:12
I knew him before that and he was a character as well.
2:26:22
Now, although you've been out of the game right now for a while,
2:26:27
how do you see the logging and timber industry having changed
2:26:32
culturally and economically?
2:26:35
Well, in spite of all the stuff that the environmentalists talk about, they've
2:26:40
totally changed, almost totally changed from large-sized timber to, their
2:26:46
focus now is on the second growth, on the stands that are available to them.
2:26:54
In fact, there's only two or three mills around that I'm aware of,
2:26:59
Starfire and Zippo and Holtup, up in your area up towards Corvallis, that
2:27:06
are able to take on huge old growth.
2:27:09
You know, so it's pretty limited to
2:27:13
industry.
2:27:14
Certainly,
2:27:16
if they aren't getting it they're going to have to change or die,
2:27:19
and they've changed pretty quickly.
2:27:21
They've changed drastically to their sawmill practices.
2:27:26
Seneca, which I'm sure you are aware of.
2:27:29
Yeah, Aaron Jones' operation?
2:27:33
They've switched over to nothing but smaller logs.
2:27:38
And that's their kind of, that's the standard.
2:27:42
And they still use that for building timber, right?
2:27:45
Oh, yeah, yeah.
2:27:46
They just cut it differently, right?
2:27:47
Yeah.
2:27:50
And what about the wood products industry?
2:27:52
I remember when I was young, one of the fathers of my Boy Scout compadres,
2:28:00
worked for, was it Georgia Pacific or -- ? Anyway, one of the companies.
2:28:04
And he was talking about the wood products industry, meaning everything
2:28:09
else that could be made out of wood that wasn't big sheets of
2:28:14
lumber, not big planks of lumber.
2:28:18
And how did that relate to the changing forest practices during your career
2:28:24
in terms of using all of the forest, even relating to what you were talking
2:28:29
about removing what later became ecologically unacceptable to do?
2:28:35
Do you understand what I'm saying?
2:28:36
Yeah.
2:28:41
Well, things change, over time.
2:28:43
Now,
2:28:45
I think the term is "other forest products." Chinquapin,
2:28:51
the ferns, the salal brush, all these other things that are, in fact, even
2:28:57
mushrooms, there's a market for mushrooms the Forest Service issues permits for.
2:29:04
So, there's always firewood, there's a whole host of
2:29:08
-- But I'm talking about the industrial forest products which were pressed
2:29:12
board and some of the weird pressboard tiles, and God only knows, and of
2:29:18
course, even pulp because you can use many parts of a tree for pulp, right?
2:29:23
Yeah.
2:29:24
That's what I'm talking about, adaptation in that area, but then how it also
2:29:29
faced a certain wall when it no longer became okay to take all the slash off
2:29:35
it and turn it into whatever forest product you could; you get my drift?
2:29:38
Yeah.
2:29:39
Well, there's still chips involved, the residue that is
2:29:45
being used for a lot of things.
2:29:47
The whole area of, oh dear, how would I say?
2:29:52
Engineered forest products like manufactured trusses, like this
2:29:59
laminated beam that supports the ceiling, the roof, here.
2:30:04
That's all made up of young forest.
2:30:08
They're glued and pressed together.
2:30:13
They're now even making
2:30:14
-- It's actually stronger, isn't it?
2:30:14
Yeah, it is.
2:30:17
And there's a whole new field of that.
2:30:21
And there's another science element, the Forest Products Lab.
2:30:27
I don't know if you're familiar with the Forest Products Lab.
2:30:30
At Corvallis?
2:30:31
No, well, there is one in Corvallis.
2:30:34
There's one in Corvallis, yeah.
2:30:35
Yeah, but the Forest Service one is in Madison, Wisconsin.
2:30:39
Oh, right, the biggest one in the country.
2:30:41
Yeah, been the leader in doing all kinds of engineering stuff.
2:30:46
Now, they're making skyscrapers out of wood, I guess, out of
2:30:50
rising concrete and steel prices, using wood for several-story, not
2:30:56
skyscrapers, but several-stories.
2:30:58
Pretty big.
2:31:00
Yeah, well, they're finding that wood is more flexible in certain contexts.
2:31:05
[Break in
2:31:09
audio]
2:31:09
One of
2:31:12
the longest-term person at the Andrews with maybe the exception
2:31:15
of Fred Swanson, was Art McKee, the [HJA] Forest Director for 30 years.
2:31:21
Yeah.
2:31:21
Tell me about your relationship with Art and how you saw what he did up there?
2:31:28
Well, Art was an interesting guy.
2:31:30
Actually, you know, Rolf [Rolf Anderson, U.S. Forest Service]
2:31:33
might be a better guy to talk to.
2:31:35
Art and Rolf had more of a relationship.
2:31:38
He was my representative on this, you know, you mentioned a tripartite, OSU,
2:31:47
the National Forest and the PNW.
2:31:51
He was my guy on the contacts there, so he would have a better
2:31:56
feeling for Art, I'm sure.
2:31:58
But I thought Art did a great job, and
2:32:04
I don't know, if he parted on the best of terms, frankly.
2:32:08
I don't know.
2:32:14
Let's talk about Fred Swanson.
2:32:15
And Fred is, as you know, now he's retired, an emeritus Forest Service
2:32:21
scientist, but he's not really retired.
2:32:24
Yeah.
2:32:24
He's a slightly milder version of Jerry Franklin in terms of intensity.
2:32:28
Right.
2:32:30
But he has almost became kind of the father figure for
2:32:37
the legacy of the Andrews.
2:32:38
I mean, he came up there in 1972 as a post-doc, I believe, and he
2:32:45
went through all the evolutions and he's still there, even though
2:32:47
he's not "officially" still there.
2:32:49
So, tell me about Fred.
2:32:52
Well, I've thought a lot about Fred.
2:32:55
He's a good hand and a
2:33:01
good tech transfer kind of guy, you know, I think.
2:33:05
How would you explain tech transfer?
2:33:07
Well, transferring the science knowledge into some practical
2:33:15
hands-on stuff for managers.
2:33:17
I think that was Fred's, one of Fred's purviews.
2:33:23
And he's
2:33:26
certainly was high in my esteem in that regard, and still is.
2:33:34
I have the feeling that Fred, especially when he was the PI at the Andrews when
2:33:40
he would be the official face, but just in general, that he would have been
2:33:44
a relatively easy guy to work with?
2:33:46
Yeah, I think so.
2:33:49
Yeah, good.
2:33:55
Okay.
2:33:58
Zane Smith, you haven't said too much about Zane.
2:34:03
Yeah, I don't know.
2:34:04
You know, I was gone.
2:34:06
There again, I left just about the time Zane came to
2:34:14
the Forest in 1970.
2:34:18
But I know Zane as a friend and a colleague, but
2:34:24
I have no idea about his relationship to the Andrews, I
2:34:27
would guess it was a positive one.
2:34:28
What was your relationship with him and what did he do in his
2:34:32
career that related to what you
2:34:36
did?
2:34:38
Well, I worked for Zane on a detail.
2:34:43
You know, I talked about RARE II.
2:34:45
I was for a few months, his
2:34:49
executive officer, kind of, and guiding the RARE II program, near its end.
2:34:58
And yeah, he was a pretty intense guy.
2:35:02
He had a mission to get that job done, and by golly, it was going to get done.
2:35:11
You know, a pretty effective person and a gentleman.
2:35:23
What kind of issues have you dealt with in this area, and you can even relate
2:35:27
to your other areas, but specifically to the Willamette that have to do
2:35:30
with squatters, illegal mines, or even sticky political situations
2:35:36
connected to legitimate mining claims based back to the Mining Act of 1872?
2:35:43
Well, the most famous one is Opal Creek.
2:35:54
We decided to take on the Atiyeh Group at Jawbone Flat.
2:36:01
They had
2:36:05
unpatented mining claims which we felt, I certainly felt, but more importantly, the
2:36:12
mining folks felt, were not legitimate.
2:36:16
So, we took them on,
2:36:23
and to my surprise, and I guess it shows the weakness of the 1872 law, they won.
2:36:31
To my horror, they won.
2:36:34
And the land became patented and they kind of thumbed their nose at us which was
2:36:40
-- Where is that exactly?
2:36:42
On the Detroit District.
2:36:44
Right, way up north.
2:36:45
Okay.
2:36:45
In the northern [portion of Willamette NF] Forest, Opal Creek, which also
2:36:49
became a very controversial thing which ended up in a wilderness, a kind
2:36:53
of postage stamp wilderness up there.
2:36:56
But
2:36:59
Atiyeh, you know,
2:37:03
he was the Governor's
2:37:06
-- Brother, right?
2:37:07
Nephew, I think.
2:37:08
Yeah, nephew.
2:37:10
He was something else.
2:37:13
And over time, that whole episode, I mean, it lasted 30 or 40 years.
2:37:20
At some point, it was dangerous to be up there.
2:37:24
I mean,
2:37:27
the relationship soured, improved, and soured, and then improved over time.
2:37:33
And finally we took them on and by golly, they won, which still, I can't believe.
2:37:42
But I guess, it shows the weakness of that law.
2:37:47
Or the strength of the law, depending on how you want to
2:37:55
-- Yeah, right.
2:37:56
Depending on the user perspective, it's the law that nobody can get rid
2:37:57
of, or can't get rid of people on the land, so at least that's what they say.
2:38:00
That's the only one, you know, the Willamette was blessed
2:38:05
with pretty solid ownership.
2:38:07
We didn't have a whole lot, well, there were some mining claims,
2:38:10
I guess, they went on, too.
2:38:13
But primarily that was not a big issue on the Willamette.
2:38:20
If you were going to give an overview of the Willamette National Forest by
2:38:23
district, how would you give a thumbnail sketch -- of district, district,
2:38:27
district -- if you were going to do that?
2:38:30
You know, the Blue River, the McKenzie, the Lowell, the Detroit,
2:38:33
how would you describe them?
2:38:34
Their differences or challenges, if you were going to give a short public
2:38:38
talk, a paragraph per district?
2:38:42
Well, I don't know.
2:38:44
That whole north Santiam country which is Detroit, has a unique, or did have, unique
2:38:56
relationship.
2:38:58
The set of
2:39:03
timber industry folks up there
2:39:07
were, you know, we took them on as being collusive at one time.
2:39:11
And I don't know that we ever got that addressed.
2:39:15
Are you talking about the actual district management?
2:39:18
No, no, no, no.
2:39:19
The industry themselves.
2:39:21
Oh, okay.
2:39:21
Kind of banded together and colluded on contracts and that sort of thing.
2:39:26
I'm not sure that we made that thing stick, but
2:39:31
we took them on.
2:39:32
And
2:39:35
so, Detroit and Sweet Home were part of the Santiam National Forest.
2:39:43
You know, you put organizations together and
2:39:51
they still felt they weren't, in my judgment anyways, felt they weren't
2:39:57
entirely part of the Willamette.
2:39:59
And this is after 40, I don't know, 60-70, well, 1933 [founding date of Willamette
2:40:04
National Forest] , so it'd be 80 years.
2:40:05
It's a tribal thing.
2:40:09
[Laughs]
2:40:09
And it may have just been the ranger that was up there when
2:40:11
I was the supervisor, too.
2:40:13
He was a pretty independent guy.
2:40:15
But they tended to have, you know, the Santiam sort of thing.
2:40:22
Detroit, more than Sweet Home.
2:40:25
Sweet Home is
2:40:28
kind an interesting district.
2:40:30
It used to be the Cascadia District, way back when.
2:40:34
And
2:40:37
they moved the town down to Sweet Home and the name changed,
2:40:42
long before I became supervisor.
2:40:44
The McKenzie, you know, was McKenzie to begin with, the
2:40:49
McKenzie Bridge Ranger District.
2:40:52
And I knew all of the rangers from,
2:40:58
oh dear, now I can't think of his name, one of the early guys.
2:41:07
[Laughs]
2:41:07
Brieglieb or
2:41:09
-? No, no, this is the district ranger at McKenzie.
2:41:14
Wow, is it raining?
2:41:17
It is raining.
2:41:17
I think the mikes are probably picking up on it.
2:41:20
Anyways, I knew all of those guys personally which
2:41:24
dates back almost 100 years.
2:41:30
And it's where I started out, so I have a fond feeling for that area.
2:41:37
The
2:41:42
Blue River, of course, was split off.
2:41:44
There was an era where we thought smaller districts, and there's
2:41:47
still a lot of folks that think, we can improve management by
2:41:52
getting it closer to the ground.
2:41:55
We've just gone through all these, in my judgment, terrible consolidations,
2:42:01
in order to save money, and I mean, the budget was driving those decisions.
2:42:05
But in the process, you've removed yourself from the
2:42:08
community you are serving.
2:42:10
The Siuslaw will be a classic example of that, right?
2:42:13
Where Siuslaw is out of Corvallis now, right?
2:42:16
Yeah.
2:42:17
The headquarters.
2:42:17
Yeah,
2:42:21
and I think they're down to two districts?
2:42:25
I think there's only two districts.
2:42:26
In the Siuslaw?
2:42:26
There's the Coastal and then there's Hebo,
2:42:31
which is pretty amazing.
2:42:34
Anyways, the Blue River District, of course, has a ranger there,
2:42:37
so I have a fond memory of it.
2:42:40
Lowell, where I started, is our most productive district, the
2:42:45
lowest elevation, the deepest soil.
2:42:52
And it's mostly, all of its high-productive land, is now in a spotted
2:42:58
owl reserve, which is interesting.
2:43:02
[Laughs] I knew Oakridge as Oakridge, and Oakridge is a
2:43:05
wonderful, balanced district.
2:43:06
It had, you know, a tremendous amount of recreation.
2:43:11
High elevation, it had very productive forests.
2:43:14
It was a very, very, very well-balanced district on its own.
2:43:20
And the Middle Fork, I mean, the Rigdon District, was another
2:43:25
fairly good-sized district.
2:43:27
Now, they've put all three of those districts together
2:43:29
and into the Middle Fork.
2:43:31
So, the Lowell, Oakridge and the Middle Fork are all one?
2:43:34
Yeah.
2:43:35
At one time,
2:43:40
those three districts probably had
2:43:44
close to 400 million board-feet coming off of them, you know.
2:43:49
Now, I don't know, if it's I think at 40, it'd be a miracle.
2:43:55
[Laughs]
2:43:57
Not that 400 was good, but I mean, they were very productive, lots
2:44:04
of activity going on, lots of people.
2:44:07
And now it's shrunk down to what it is.
2:44:13
Mike's going to segue into sustainable forestry.
2:44:15
Yeah.
2:44:16
Back in the '50s, the law didn't require what it does now with wildlife and so on.
2:44:24
And
2:44:26
so, we were practicing a form of sustainable harvest,
2:44:30
at least in my judgment.
2:44:32
But
2:44:35
when I was here, we had a harvest level of, sustainable level of
2:44:41
800 million board-feet, which is guts, feathers and all, and that's
2:44:45
coal, material and everything.
2:44:48
When we looked hard at the requirements, the NFMA and
2:44:55
what we thought we knew about the ESA [Endangered Species Act] , and the water
2:45:01
and air laws, that came down to less than, well, a little over 500 million feet.
2:45:15
So, depending on what the constraints are, but given what we know now,
2:45:22
certainly, the 800 million, you couldn't sustain that and the other things
2:45:26
that you're supposed to be doing also.
2:45:28
So, it changes over time.
2:45:33
But certainly, I would think, I don't know what the Forest would do now.
2:45:38
I think
2:45:41
whatever the quantity that they coined in the Northwest Forest Plan was something
2:45:48
in the order of 200 million, I think.
2:45:51
They haven't come anywhere near that.
2:45:53
Because there's so many road blocks, politically and otherwise.
2:45:55
Correct?
2:45:56
Yeah.
2:45:57
One thing I didn't address earlier; there was a land exchange with the Giustina
2:46:02
Brothers at the Blue River Reservoir.
2:46:05
Was that before or after you got here at the very beginning of your career?
2:46:11
Do you remember?
2:46:13
Well, I know early on, we had a big Giustina land exchange, but
2:46:17
it was further downriver, I think.
2:46:20
And it
2:46:23
probably involved some of that stuff near the Blue River Reservoir, too.
2:46:28
Kent Mays was involved in cruising that land exchange.
2:46:34
I wasn't involved particularly.
2:46:37
Well, I wasn't involved at all.
2:46:39
But there was, and that was in where we were trying to consolidate
2:46:44
lands in terms of management effectiveness and that sort of thing.
2:46:52
What was your favorite posting?
2:46:57
Do you have a favorite posting or would it change for different reasons?
2:47:00
Oh, it changes for different reasons.
2:47:03
In Eureka, we had this wonderful three-story redwood
2:47:08
Victorian, which was amazing.
2:47:13
But the weather, you know, foggy on the foggy coast, it wasn't
2:47:18
the best weather in the world.
2:47:19
I enjoyed the job, but I loved that old, wonderful Victorian home.
2:47:25
That, you mean, your headquarters?
2:47:27
No, it was our
2:47:28
-- Your actual home?
2:47:29
Home, yeah.
2:47:30
We had one of those.
2:47:32
You know, if you've been to Eureka, it's just full of those old Victorian
2:47:37
homes, and we bought it for 25,000 bucks.
2:47:42
That thing now is probably worth ten times that, I would guess, if not more.
2:47:49
We didn't really talk about that, but since you were down in the
2:47:52
redwoods area, how did that management challenge compare to up here?
2:47:59
I mean, where the old-growth remnants of the redwoods became the conglomerate of
2:48:03
parks, state and national, Redwoods State and National Parks, how would you compare
2:48:09
that management challenge with up here?
2:48:12
And let's just stay with the Willamette or even the Mount Baker, maybe?
2:48:16
Well, I remember a guy saying at the time when I arrived, it was 1970 and
2:48:29
the park had just been established.
2:48:33
And the grand bargain was that they, the National Park Service,
2:48:38
was also going to take over the state parks, which never happened.
2:48:45
I don't know what happened there.
2:48:47
But
2:48:52
the Six Rivers,
2:48:55
thank goodness, didn't have any redwoods.
2:48:58
You know, there was the Redwood National
2:49:00
-- You mean, Six Rivers National Forest had no redwoods?
2:49:02
No.
2:49:03
Oh, okay.
2:49:04
It was inland.
2:49:04
My mistake then, okay.
2:49:06
But there was a Redwood Experimental Forest, which, kind of in a sense,
2:49:12
was irrelevant to our needs.
2:49:15
If it was supplying any needs, it was to maybe the Park Service
2:49:21
[National] , because their whole thrust was managing for old growth, which
2:49:25
was fine, but we didn't have any.
2:49:29
Okay, my bad there.
2:49:30
But, it was, wow, it was a gut-wrenching deal there.
2:49:34
You know,
2:49:37
the park takeover and the feelings of the people down there.
2:49:44
The loggers and so on, it was a tough thing for them.
2:49:49
Yeah, I never realized until I studied the subject, what a tiny percentage of
2:49:56
the original redwood groves are left.
2:49:58
Yeah.
2:50:00
Especially considering the challenges with harvesting trees that big.
2:50:03
Oh, I know.
2:50:07
Although it's interesting that people, most people, don't know, but really-big,
2:50:11
old-growth Douglas-firs, can come pretty close to the size of redwoods.
2:50:17
Correct?
2:50:17
Yeah, nine, 10 feet, yeah.
2:50:20
And even 300 feet high?
2:50:22
Yeah.
2:50:23
Or even 100-foot.
2:50:23
Yeah, in fact, we've got one on the Forest [Willamette]
2:50:25
that's 300 feet high, I think.
2:50:27
Yeah, so it's tough.
2:50:28
I went out on a site once with a
2:50:33
group, I think probably it was the Society of American Foresters
2:50:36
group while I was down there.
2:50:39
And I just came away from there saying, "Thank God, we don't have to manage
2:50:42
this stuff." I mean, if you go out on the site, it's a horrendous look.
2:50:49
These smashed up, downed, you know, they gouge benched ones in
2:50:55
a way so that they don't break, because they're pretty brittle.
2:50:59
And
2:51:02
it's a pretty disturbing, you know, ground-disturbing operation.
2:51:09
Yeah, I believe that.
2:51:13
And they kind of, you know, industry kind of poked their nose right in.
2:51:18
They did this stuff right in front of the public, too, which kind of heightened,
2:51:23
I think, the demise of the whole thing.
2:51:27
A couple other names.
2:51:28
I think you were searching for a couple of names, so I'm going
2:51:30
to read a couple off this list.
2:51:32
Jeff Sirmon?
2:51:34
Yeah, Jeff was regional forester in Six [Region] , sometime in the early '80s.
2:51:42
He followed Dick Worthington, I think.
2:51:46
At the Willamette, or Region
2:51:47
? No, in the region.
2:51:48
He was at the regional forest level, yeah.
2:51:50
An engineer from Utah.
2:51:54
Good guy.
2:51:56
In terms of the people that staff most of the forests around here now, are they
2:52:00
still coming out of forestry schools?
2:52:03
You know, I have no idea.
2:52:05
You don't know?
2:52:06
Okay.
2:52:07
I don't know.
2:52:07
Forestry schools themselves have changed, incredibly.
2:52:11
They're more natural resource management than just forestry.
2:52:16
So, I probably should have qualified that.
2:52:17
But another name.
2:52:19
But a whole different science.
2:52:21
I mean, a whole different range of sciences,
2:52:25
from watershed to soil, to all these various disciplines, are
2:52:31
now a bigger part of the staff.
2:52:34
Now, did you ever get a master's?
2:52:36
No.
2:52:37
So, today, you almost have to go and get a master's.
2:52:39
Right?
2:52:40
Oh, I know.
2:52:40
Isn't that kind of almost the bar, although different for entry,
2:52:44
depending on what you're doing?
2:52:46
Well, I don't know.
2:52:47
I know in my kids, you know, it's certainly true there.
2:52:53
Another name, Ted Dyrness.
2:52:54
Do you remember Ted?
2:52:57
I do.
2:52:58
He's one of the Andrews people we didn't mention.
2:53:00
You were searching for a name earlier, I thought I'd bring that up, too.
2:53:03
Yeah, I knew Dick Fredriksen better.
2:53:05
But Ted was a soils guy, I think?
2:53:08
Well, some vegetation, too.
2:53:10
Oh, vegetation.
2:53:11
Okay.
2:53:12
Vegetation.
2:53:12
He wrote that book with Jerry Franklin on the vegetation of the
2:53:14
Northwest, which is still considered the "bible" on the subject.
2:53:17
Yeah.
2:53:19
Dick, I knew.
2:53:20
He was a winemaker.
2:53:22
Fredriksen.
2:53:23
And I was a winemaker.
2:53:25
Aha.
2:53:25
And still am a winemaker.
2:53:27
You are?
2:53:27
Yeah.
2:53:30
Ah, here's one.
2:53:32
How do you differentiate between these two terms, conservationism
2:53:38
and environmentalism?
2:53:40
Hmm.
2:53:44
I don't know.
2:53:44
I guess,
2:53:48
you take
2:53:51
environmentalism, maybe would be the more activist end of the conservation
2:53:56
spectrum, the more maybe radical, and the "stop the world" sort of thing.
2:54:06
Whereas a conservationist,
2:54:10
on that spectrum, is maybe a little more balanced between
2:54:12
use and conserving resources.
2:54:19
That's how I'd view it anyway.
2:54:23
Now, the Oregon Natural Resources Council, that was one of the groups that was
2:54:29
involved during the French Pete era.
2:54:32
Am I correct?
2:54:35
I get those confused.
2:54:36
Is that the one that turned into Oregon Wild?
2:54:41
I think so, but I'm not sure.
2:54:42
I think so, yes.
2:54:45
Yeah.
2:54:46
They may have been involved.
2:54:47
But I think in those days, I think that the point people were from the
2:54:53
Sierra Club, but I might be wrong.
2:54:57
John Ray Bruckart.
2:55:01
Yeah, John was
2:55:02
-- That's another name we didn't mention.
2:55:03
John was forest supervisor [Willamette NF] when I first came in 1954.
2:55:07
Okay, good.
2:55:08
I'm glad I brought that up.
2:55:09
Yeah, and the "old guard," you know, he, J.R. is that, J.R. Bruckart.
2:55:17
Was he a tough-old boy?
2:55:19
Well, yeah.
2:55:20
At that point, I was a 21-year-old.
2:55:23
It was hard for me to make a judgment, but he seemed to be a pretty stiff-laced guy.
2:55:33
Probably of the era where, they had staff cars with flags and he could have been
2:55:39
part of that era back into the '30s.
2:55:42
He also came from the Olympic National Forest, and he bitterly
2:55:48
opposed the carving of the Olympic National Park out of it.
2:55:53
That may have been one of the reasons, I mean, I've heard that as one of
2:55:58
the reasons, he was moved down here.
2:56:01
When they tried to expand the park into a couple of areas?
2:56:04
Well, no, when they created the park.
2:56:06
Created the
2:56:13
park, right, in '48, I believe.
2:56:13
You know, it ended up being a donut around a park.
2:56:14
They took the center of the forest out.
2:56:19
Perry Thompson?
2:56:21
Well, I don't know Perry, but he was an old, a supervisor back
2:56:29
in the '30s.
2:56:30
So, tell me about the selection of rangers, about that process?
2:56:34
Yeah, well, the first opportunity I had was when Jim Caswell left the
2:56:41
Deputy [supervisor] job over on the Boise [National Forest] , and Jim was
2:56:44
an effective person, I thought, with the Andrews in terms, but I wanted
2:56:50
to be sure that his successor really
2:56:56
had the,
2:56:59
well, the mindset, I guess, to be able to work with scientists and to
2:57:07
become a partner in that whole thing.
2:57:12
Right.
2:57:12
And so, we did interview.
2:57:14
I can't remember all the folks in the interview.
2:57:16
But the one that stood out and the one we selected was Steve Eubanks, who turned out
2:57:23
to be an outstanding selection in terms of having a bent towards science and the
2:57:35
whole inquiring mind, and who established a great partnership with the Andrews.
2:57:43
And that was before you had a full-time science liaison officer,
2:57:46
too, so he would have been a perfect transition person there, right?
2:57:47
That's true,
2:57:50
yeah.
2:57:51
So, anyways, Jim eventually left, or I mean, Steve, and so, we had
2:57:59
the chance to pick another one.
2:58:00
And here again, we interviewed a number of candidates, and of that bunch, Lynn
2:58:08
Burditt, I thought, would follow maybe not in the same footsteps as Steve,
2:58:15
because Steve was a pretty remarkable guy.
2:58:18
In fact, following his career, he ended up as supervisor down on the Tahoe.
2:58:29
And I think he, I don't know if he was successful, but he was pushing
2:58:34
for establishing an experimental forest on the Tahoe National Forest.
2:58:40
And I don't know if that happened or not.
2:58:42
But he was an interesting guy.
2:58:46
But Lynn had a little, you know, she was a different person, but
2:58:49
I think still established a good relationship with the Andrews.
2:58:54
But I guess, the point I'm making is that we made a point of selecting somebody and
2:59:03
with a heads-up in the interview that this is what's important for this position to
2:59:10
do, and that's to work with scientists.
2:59:12
Would you say, in terms of the different districts of the Willamette, if you
2:59:17
were going to pick somebody with more a science bent or interest, it would
2:59:21
probably be for that district, just because of the Andrews being there?
2:59:25
Yeah, at that point in time, it was, certainly.
2:59:27
I mean, that was the whole, one of the key steps, right.
2:59:33
Within the Forest Service, how would you characterize the reputation of
2:59:38
the Andrews beyond just you guys that knew them because you were here close?
2:59:44
Because a lot of its findings, from the Andrews, they're
2:59:48
everywhere now, the science.
2:59:50
Yeah.
2:59:50
So, how would you characterize the reputation of the Andrews?
2:59:56
Well, I think pretty solid, but I don't know.
3:00:00
I was here, close, and
3:00:04
I think the region felt good about it.
3:00:06
You know, we hosted that leadership team meeting on the Andrews in the
3:00:11
'80s, and I think it was a good feeling about what was going on there.
3:00:19
I hope it was positive.
3:00:22
Speaking of something more humorous, were you there when there was a supposed
3:00:30
issue between either the district ranger or maybe the forest supervisor,
3:00:36
and the Andrews staff skinny-dipping in places that were possibly
3:00:42
visible by the public and families?
3:00:44
No.
3:00:45
You never remember that?
3:00:47
No.
3:00:48
No, but that did happen very early on.
3:00:50
Really?
3:00:51
Where, in Lookout Creek or
3:00:53
-- ? It might have been Lookout or somewhere else.
3:00:55
But, you know, they'd be up there working all day and they'd go out and just jump
3:00:59
in, you know, no swimming suits needed.
3:01:03
But anyway, that's neither here nor there.
3:01:04
But that did happen, I just don't know if you knew anything about that.
3:01:08
No.
3:01:11
What do you believe is the ethical responsibility of the land manager in the
3:01:17
American context, specifically the Forest Service, but you can even say the BLM.
3:01:22
I mean, what is ethical responsibility of the land manager for what they
3:01:26
do and what they are managing?
3:01:28
Well, I would say, to hand it off to the next generation in a better condition
3:01:33
than you found it, if that's possible.
3:01:36
That would be the ethical context that I, personally believe in.
3:01:41
And I've heard it form a lot of other folks, too,
3:01:47
that that's how most folks felt.
3:01:54
OSU and U.S. Forest Service co-administration of the Andrews
3:01:58
can be today held up as a model for effective inter-institutional
3:02:03
management and science.
3:02:05
How would you characterize that relationship and its evolution?
3:02:10
Well, I would hold it up as a model also.
3:02:12
You know, on the Coc, we had the Long Valley Experimental Forest, and the
3:02:18
relationship, and we had NAU [Northern Az.
3:02:19
Univ.] , and
3:02:22
it would have been great to have a relationship or a contract or whatever
3:02:30
document that was similar to that.
3:02:33
But there wasn't an MOU and there wasn't that triad?
3:02:38
Not that I know, certainly, there couldn't have been.
3:02:41
In fact, it was a "we/they" sort of thing, you know, if anything,
3:02:45
with the rangers and so on.
3:02:49
Where was Long Valley [see below] located compared to where?
3:02:51
Where, near Hart Prairie [west of San Francisco Peaks]
3:02:51
. It was right there.
3:02:52
Okay, got you.
3:02:53
Yeah, kind of in that area.
3:02:55
And it's the oldest, I think it's the oldest experimental forest in the nation.
3:03:00
Isn't that also called Fort Valley or
3:03:02
-- ? Yeah, Fort Valley, isn't that what I said?
3:03:03
No, you said Long Valley.
3:03:05
Oh, Fort Valley.
3:03:06
No, Long Valley's a different one.
3:03:08
Well, no, Long Valley's a ranger district.
3:03:10
Oh, right, right.
3:03:11
Yeah, Fort Valley, that's what I meant, yeah.
3:03:13
No, Fort Valley, right.
3:03:13
So, but there wasn't that tight meshing of mission purpose velocity and exchange
3:03:20
of science and ideas and management?
3:03:22
No, there certainly wasn't.
3:03:24
Because that's my impression is that, though I'm sure there's been
3:03:27
rough patches, but it's a really tightly-woven thing that seems to
3:03:33
have found a good comfort zone?
3:03:36
The one that exists here?
3:03:37
Here, yes.
3:03:37
Yeah, there was nothing like that down there.
3:03:40
And then could have used it, I mean, we could have directed.
3:03:44
You know, the scientists were off doing their thing and managers were
3:03:47
out, and nary the two would meet.
3:03:53
I've only seen it here in the Andrews.
3:03:55
And it's too bad.
3:03:56
Okay, so you know of no other place even nationally where there's been
3:04:00
something that well woven together?
3:04:03
I can't speak for that, but I'm not aware of it, no.
3:04:06
But I'm sure there must be somewhere.
3:04:07
Well, back East, the Coweeta.
3:04:09
Coweeta, I was going to say.
3:04:10
Which is another LTER, I think there's probably similar dynamics
3:04:14
involving the University of Georgia.
3:04:16
But I can't speak from first-hand experience.
3:04:19
If you wanted to make a kind of a capstone statement to this interview, your career,
3:04:25
the Andrews, what would you want it to be, Mike, I'll give you the floor?
3:04:29
Well, I don't know.
3:04:30
We've talked an awful lot.
3:04:33
I think we've captured a lot of
3:04:36
what I had to say.
3:04:39
But, you know, when I was supervisor, a group of supervisors, in fact, the
3:04:46
national leadership team got together, and they coined a phrase that I think
3:04:51
really captures the essence of what the National Forest System is all about.
3:04:59
And it became the motto, and hopefully it's still the motto, and that is,
3:05:04
"Caring for the Land and Serving People." Those two things are what I think
3:05:12
the national forests are all about.
3:05:15
Now, it's a national forest system.
3:05:18
The science side of it certainly has a part in that.
3:05:24
And how can we do that better?
3:05:27
How can we serve people better?
3:05:29
How can we care for the land better than we are now?
3:05:34
Good.
3:05:35
It sounds like a fantastic finish.
3:05:37
Thank you, sir.
3:05:37
Okay.
3:05:38
All right.
3:05:39
All right.
