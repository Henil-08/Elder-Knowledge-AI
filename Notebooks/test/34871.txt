00:01
Good morning, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State University
00:04
College of Forestry, U.S. Forest Service.
00:06
We are here today at the Upper McKenzie Rural Fire Protection District Station 1,
00:15
with Chief Norm Michaels, also retired U.S. Forest Service.
00:20
And we are going to be doing an oral history interview today which is part
00:24
of a history project focused on the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest,
00:29
its history, but also on its science, land use and land management issues.
00:34
So, we will be interviewing both scientists as well
00:37
as Forest Service people.
00:38
And Norm being involved with the Andrews and working in this area for many years
00:43
and now living here, he is going to be an important part of this study.
00:47
So, I want to thank you, Norm, for taking time to meet us this morning.
00:50
Sure.
00:51
So, I always like to start pretty much the same way.
00:55
Where were you born and raised?
00:56
Just tell me a little about your past and where you came from.
01:00
Okay, I was born in Oakland, California, raised in the south San
01:05
Francisco Bay area for the most part.
01:09
I spent a little time in the California Sierras and then a little time in
01:18
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, around the Yellowstone area.
01:22
So, now, what was your childhood like especially in
01:25
relation to the natural world?
01:26
I mean, you mentioned those places that you visited, I take
01:29
it, on family vacations perhaps?
01:31
Family vacations and living.
01:33
Right.
01:33
And but just in terms of your daily existence?
01:35
Oh,
01:38
pretty much urban, for the most part, but got exposed in a couple places we lived to
01:43
the forests, and that's where I developed my interest in forests and forestry.
01:50
What do you remember about, let's say, an early interaction with nature, even
01:55
something in the urban/rural interface right there in the South Bay area?
02:04
One of the things that we did as kids was go through the fence at the end
02:09
of the street and we were into the marshes of the south San Francisco
02:13
Bay, and spent a lot of time out there.
02:17
What do you remember about that ecosystem back then?
02:22
Oh, as kids, we liked to hop on the crude rafts that the big kids had put
02:30
together already and pole around in the little sloughs [pulling/pushing with
02:32
poles] , and look at the fish and other critters that were in those sloughs.
02:37
And were those sloughs connected to any industrial or
02:41
agricultural uses at that time?
02:43
No, they were actually just going into the Bay.
02:47
And where we were, there wasn't any real industrial uses.
02:59
Now, you mentioned some of your trips with family or otherwise
03:04
to the Sierras and other places.
03:06
Tell me about some specific trips, places, experiences that made an
03:12
impression on you, whether it was with forestry or just more generally with
03:17
the environment, science and nature?
03:21
My mom taught at a rural school in the Sierras for a year.
03:28
So, we lived in the Sierras, basically, the Plumas National
03:34
Forest was our backyard.
03:38
And where exactly in the Sierras was that?
03:43
Quincy, California.
03:45
Would that be central, southern or
03:49
-- ? North of Sacramento.
03:51
Okay, so you're up by Tahoe then?
03:53
Yeah, closer to Tahoe.
03:54
Fairly close, right, got you.
03:58
And any experiences with wildlife?
04:03
Nothing specifically that I remember.
04:05
I mean, there was wildlife there, but I don't recall, nothing sticks out.
04:11
Now, how did you become interested in forestry and land management?
04:14
You alluded to that earlier, but kind of give me a little train
04:18
of thought in how you started thinking about a career out there?
04:24
That year living with the national forest [Plumas] as our backyard
04:32
kind of developed my interest
04:36
in forestry.
04:37
You know, I didn't know it was forestry at the time, but working in the woods.
04:42
Do you ever remember interacting with U.S. Forest Service or Park
04:45
Service or any other professionals?
04:48
No.
04:49
Not until after I graduated from high school.
04:56
What did your family do, who were your parents?
04:59
My mom did a little bit of everything because she was a teacher.
05:02
She also did secretarial work and so on.
05:06
My step-dad was an electronics engineer.
05:13
Do you ever remember any
05:18
book or movie or television report about the Forest Service
05:24
or forestry or some representation of that, which you remember?
05:32
Probably what got me exposed to it was 4-H that year we were up there in the Sierras.
05:40
There was a 4-H club and they had a forestry section.
05:44
So, I didn't want to raise rabbits, so I did the forestry.
05:55
Now, you're looking back through the lens of a full career as a forester, but
06:01
how would you describe the forestry and land management dynamics that you first
06:06
saw, even when you were an adolescent or a young adult going out there.
06:10
And did you take note of any of these things?
06:15
I think as an adolescent, I really didn't understand what I was
06:23
seeing, so there weren't any big
06:28
"aha" moments.
06:29
You
06:32
know, I vaguely
06:36
remember, I think, they were doing selection harvest in
06:40
that area, primarily pine.
06:46
But I don't remember any
06:51
crisp memories of it.
06:53
Now, you also mentioned going to Idaho and Montana, also, I believe?
06:57
Yeah.
06:58
Tell me a little about those experiences?
07:00
It was one of those things that my step-dad thought he had a job
07:05
in Montana, so he moved there and then found out he didn't.
07:11
[Laughs]
07:13
So, the Montana thing didn't happen, but what did you see when you were
07:17
up there in Idaho and Montana?
07:20
So, when in Montana and Idaho,
07:28
we lived in farming communities.
07:32
My step-dad was looking for electronic engineering positions, and not
07:38
finding them, not surprisingly.
07:41
And then one summer, I worked for his brother in the Jackson Hole area.
07:51
He was a small-time contractor that did just about anything.
07:56
So, we built fences and sprayed nasty chemicals on trees to kill
08:02
bugs and that sort of thing, but mostly out in the woods.
08:05
And this was in Jackson Hole?
08:07
Yeah, Jackson Hole and the surrounding area.
08:09
That must have been a stunning environment to do anything in?
08:14
Oh, it was, it was.
08:15
You know,
08:19
one of my memories is about moose.
08:21
We were working in the [Grand] Teton National Park.
08:26
And moose weren't terribly frightened of people, and we knew
08:32
well enough to be wary of them.
08:34
Didn't have any problems, but when a moose crosses twenty feet in front
08:38
of you, you have to stop and watch.
08:42
Even a female cow is very large.
08:45
Yes, yes.
08:47
And a little bit intimidating when they have a calf with them.
08:51
Yeah, they're a little protective.
08:52
Yeah, yeah.
08:53
That goes without saying.
08:57
So, any other places you remember seeing when you were in Idaho or Montana?
09:01
Did you ever go to, you went to Yellowstone obviously?
09:04
Went to Yellowstone, yeah, a few times.
09:11
Went into the forests around,
09:19
basically, Idaho Falls area of Idaho, so probably into the
09:22
Targhee [NE Idaho] , I expect.
09:27
But in Montana, we got into the forests there some and then probably, hmm, I'm
09:35
not sure which forest that would have been.
09:37
You never made it up as far as Glacier?
09:39
No.
09:40
Did you ever go down to the Wind Rivers?
09:42
[Mtn.
09:42
range in Wyoming]
09:42
No.
09:42
Which were just down the way from you?
09:44
Yes.
09:49
Now, did you ever float any rivers when you were younger?
09:52
No.
09:52
You mentioned before the interview.
09:53
Yeah, but didn't back then.
09:54
That you're very much into floating rivers, but that had
09:56
not entered your life yet?
09:57
No.
10:02
Well, I must have been over thirty before I started floating rivers.
10:06
A friend of mine was interested and he invited me along on some trips.
10:14
Now,
10:17
how would you compare the Sierra's western slope where you spent time with
10:24
the ecology of the Pacific Northwest and specifically the Cascades western slope?
10:30
So, the Sierra is more like
10:35
the east slope of the Cascades.
10:38
Moister,
10:41
so things do fairly well, but still a much drier climate than
10:46
the west slope of the Cascades.
10:49
More pines, a little bit of Doug-fir, but more pines than
10:54
the drier species where I was.
10:59
And how would you describe aesthetic, the artistic qualities,
11:03
if you will, of the two areas?
11:06
I'm one of those folks that likes just about any forest system,
11:11
and looks at what's there, and appreciates what's there.
11:15
So, I'm one of those crazy guys that I like the west
11:18
side and I like the east side.
11:20
And I don't really have a preference for one or the other.
11:24
I just enjoy what's there and what it's doing, and enjoy the challenge of
11:30
figuring out how to grow trees there.
11:39
Okay, tell me about your late high school years and transition to college,
11:45
and how the professional track started.
11:49
And was there a connection from high school to college or not,
11:52
or did your whole professional development kind of start after you
11:56
left the lair and went to college?
11:58
Pretty much started after I went to college.
12:02
In high school, we were pretty much urban.
12:07
We would get out some into the forest, but probably more to the
12:14
beach because my dad liked to fish.
12:22
I actually worked in a state park [California] between my freshman
12:27
and junior years, or freshman and sophomore years of college.
12:31
But by then, I knew I wanted to get into forestry.
12:36
I pretty much knew during high school that I was interested in forestry,
12:42
and was pretty sure I'd get into it.
12:43
But do you remember how that happened?
12:46
I think that exposure back in the Sierras to forestry.
12:52
At that time, you didn't really know what it meant, you
12:54
just thought it sounded cool?
12:55
Yeah, basically.
12:58
[Laughs] I thought I would enjoy working out in the woods.
13:02
And as it turns out, I did.
13:05
So, how did Oregon State come to be where you went to school?
13:09
That was a really esoteric type of thing.
13:12
I graduated from high school in '68.
13:17
The draft was going really strong.
13:23
My step-dad, who had been a Marine, said, "Go to college first, and then
13:28
go into the service." So, I took his advice for some weird reason.
13:34
At that age, you're not terribly interested in taking
13:37
the advice of your parents.
13:39
At least I wasn't.
13:40
But I took his advice.
13:42
So,
13:44
I went to college first.
13:45
So, you entered OSU in what year?
13:49
So, the first, my freshman year, I went to San Jose State.
13:53
Where?
13:53
San Jose State.
13:54
San Jose State, okay.
13:55
Yeah.
13:58
Just because, I think I wasn't prepared to apply to forestry schools yet.
14:07
And then I realized that during my freshman year when I was
14:11
looking at forestry schools, that
14:15
Cal-Berkeley required that you go to summer school.
14:20
I didn't know if I went to a summer school, I'd have
14:22
to lay off the regular term.
14:24
And if I laid off the regular term, I'd get drafted.
14:28
The San Jose draft board was infamous for being really sticklers for that.
14:34
You went to school during the regular school year, not at summer.
14:37
Do you remember what your lottery number was?
14:39
It was 125.
14:40
It was low enough that
14:41
-- You were nervous?
14:42
Oh, no, I would have been selected.
14:44
I mean,
14:47
they ran the lottery, if your lottery number was selected,
14:54
you had the number, you were
14:58
going to be selected as soon as you got through with the deferment.
15:04
But at least, that's how the San Jose board worked it.
15:06
So your step-father was a retired Marine?
15:09
Well, he was
15:15
four-year or whatever; he wasn't a career guy.
15:18
Okay.
15:18
But were you kind of a patriotic true-blue kind of kid or
15:22
-? Well, I'd say not rah-rah, but I'd expected to go into the service.
15:30
And you maybe hadn't seen yet at that age, well, maybe you heard
15:34
about things, but the negativities that built over time with people?
15:38
[Vietnam]
15:38
Oh, it was really negative in the California area.
15:41
Even in '67-'68?
15:43
Yeah, yes, it was really negative there.
15:44
But I just didn't know how much you were exposed to that because
15:47
-- A lot, just because that it was big news there.
15:52
What kind of an impression did that make on you?
15:54
I mean, you're obviously a young, developing mind and person, and the
16:01
anti-war thing went totally against the mythology of the U.S. and war,
16:08
and being the good guys always.
16:09
Yeah.
16:10
How did that affect you or how do you remember processing that?
16:22
I probably don't remember that much.
16:25
I wasn't anti-war.
16:28
I probably thought we were stupid to be there, but I wasn't anti-war.
16:32
You know, I had friends going into the service.
16:36
I didn't think they were idiots.
16:47
So I guess I was somewhere in the middle there.
16:50
I was fully expecting to
16:54
join the service when I graduated from college.
16:58
Turns out, they quit drafting about the time I had graduated from college.
17:04
Which would have been what year?
17:06
'72.
17:06
Okay, let's go back to San Jose State, one year.
17:09
Yeah.
17:09
How did you get to Oregon State?
17:11
Okay.
17:12
So, I was looking at forestry schools.
17:14
Cal-Berkeley required summer school, which I said I knew if I went to
17:19
that, I'd have to take a regular term off, which would have meant
17:23
automatically going into the service.
17:26
Oregon State didn't.
17:28
Because they're so close to the forest, they did their labs just during the
17:32
regular school year, you know, a 10-minute ride out to the forest, and no big deal.
17:36
Are you talking about the McDonald Forest?
17:37
McDonald Forest, and other forests around there [Corvallis and OSU]
17:40
. Right.
17:43
So, I decided to go there.
17:46
I was lucky enough that they gave me
17:52
scholarships for the out-of-state portion of the tuition write-off, and
17:56
then after my sophomore year, they gave me scholarships for all of my tuition.
18:02
So, it didn't end up costing me any more than I would have.
18:07
Now, you didn't take any forestry classes at San Jose State?
18:11
No.
18:12
You just took like preparatory classes, right?
18:14
Yeah, the standard classes I was going to have to take
18:17
anyway no matter where I went.
18:21
What do you remember about your classes at Oregon State, and
18:24
specifically, a particular teacher or class or something that made an
18:29
especially strong impression on you?
18:38
I don't remember any specific
18:43
class that made a particularly strong impression on me at this point.
18:49
Did you have any favorite professors?
18:56
Probably not at that time.
19:04
Because I had not gone the first year, I had to pick up my freshman
19:09
forestry classes, which there was only one or two of them.
19:13
And because I wanted to get done in four years, I was taking anywhere
19:19
from 18 to 21 units a term.
19:24
A serious full load.
19:26
A serious full load, yes.
19:28
So, I think I was more just nose-to-the-grindstone,
19:32
trying to get it done.
19:35
And what do you remember about any of your experiences and field work
19:42
connected to the OSU program of study, that you did which made an
19:46
impression or certain things and places that occurred during that process?
19:50
We saw lots of different places.
19:54
And I think at that time, I was into learning, that it was all new.
20:00
So, it was all new, and therefore, kind of interesting.
20:08
So, you really liked it?
20:09
I liked it, yeah.
20:14
And, were any of the particular field trips to the McDonald or
20:18
other places especially memorable?
20:21
Actually, probably the only ones that were, actually a couple of them.
20:27
We did a field trip to see a logging show.
20:32
And it kind of surprised me, but only because being young,
20:35
you don't know the history.
20:37
They were using a spar tree.
20:39
Now, as I learned later, at that point, they were just getting out of using spar
20:45
trees and going to the metal towers.
20:48
But I didn't know that at the time.
20:49
I thought metal towers, they must have been using these all the time.
20:52
No, they hadn't been.
20:55
How was forestry and the forest as resource represented to you
21:03
in your program of study at OSU?
21:08
So, I'd say, similar to Gifford Pinchot's philosophy that the forests
21:14
are there to be wisely-used, and
21:19
kind of here's how you would do it.
21:22
And basically
21:22
--? Here's how trees grow, here's how you measure them, and here's how
21:25
you make some decisions about them.
21:27
Still within the utilitarian model?
21:30
Oh, yes, yes.
21:31
Even though we're talking about the transition period in the '60s and '70s.
21:37
It was still utilitarian.
21:38
The revolution had not come into the College of Forestry [OSU]
21:42
in terms of programs of study, new professors, new ideas, yet?
21:46
Right, yeah.
21:48
As students, we joked and called it the "Clear-Cut and Burn
21:52
School of Forestry." [Laughs]
21:55
Really?
21:56
Yeah.
21:59
But that's when you were students?
22:00
Yeah, yeah.
22:01
So, my question would be segueing off of that, is that you were already
22:05
developing a social consciousness.
22:07
Oh, yeah.
22:08
Independently of the ideology of how it used to be, thinking,
22:14
"I'm not sure about this method?"
22:17
Well, I'd say more a questioning of degree rather than
22:27
how to do it more, should it be done everywhere, yeah, that sort of thing.
22:32
In other words?
22:34
We were students of our age.
22:37
But in other words, the main thing that may have bothered you or had
22:42
sent up a red flag, was the scope of post-World War II practices, shall we
22:48
say, industrial logging, that maybe you saw it as being a little much?
22:53
Actually no.
22:56
Maybe.
22:57
But I'd say that what I saw was,
23:04
we, the profession, were going into some places that you probably ought
23:08
not cut, you know, just because it would be too difficult to get to some.
23:12
What would be a for example?
23:14
Very rocky slopes that you'd have to beat your head against
23:17
the wall to get them reforested.
23:19
Right.
23:20
You know, or might not be able to get reforested.
23:23
You know, stuff that you're mining, rather than managing it.
23:29
Right.
23:36
What did you do immediately after you graduated in 1972?
23:41
What opportunities were offered and how did you become a Forest Service person?
23:46
The country was in a slight depression at that point.
23:51
The Forest Service really wasn't hiring.
23:54
So, I did the next best thing and got a job as a technician
23:59
with the Forest Service.
24:00
Actually, it started out as temporary, as a lot of folks did.
24:06
I managed to be a temporary about a year-and-a-half.
24:10
And where was that?
24:11
First in the regional office [Forest Service - Region] out of Portland with
24:14
the insect and disease control folks.
24:16
And then, Siuslaw National Forest, on their timber inventory.
24:20
Where were you based out of, Corvallis, or over on the coast?
24:23
Corvallis.
24:31
Now, did you have any mentors or role models that you met when
24:39
you were in the Forest Service that influenced you, people that
24:44
--? Sure, I think most people have.
24:49
But it was my supervisor on the inventory was a forester, who was a planner for
24:58
the forest, and I learned a lot from him.
25:02
I moved out to the Alsea District [Siuslaw NF] as a forest
25:06
technician working in silviculture.
25:09
My boss there was a technician and had a lot of years of experience, and
25:13
was bright enough to use my abilities.
25:17
So, I was actually working way beyond that.
25:19
And how would you describe your abilities?
25:21
I mean, everybody has aptitudes that they develop, either they
25:25
discover them or they develop them.
25:28
What did you know at that time and what were your aptitudes?
25:31
So,
25:39
a couple, three different ones.
25:40
Having worked in insect and disease control, I knew a lot more about
25:44
some of the particular root diseases that Siuslaw was dealing with.
25:48
So, when I got out on the district [Alsea] , they used my knowledge there to help
25:54
develop some plans for dealing with them.
26:01
Also, having been a forester, you know, being trained as a forester,
26:07
they used some of those skills beyond what you'd normally ask a
26:11
technician to do in terms of planning.
26:15
For instance, what would be the normal duties in contrast to
26:19
the extra things you just said?
26:20
Normally, at the level I was as a technician, they'd tell you, go out
26:25
and measure some plots, and lay out a unit for planting or thinning.
26:33
Inspect that, those sorts of things.
26:37
They went beyond and asked me to go out and evaluate some areas, particularly
26:46
areas that were growing hardwoods, to evaluate whether they ought to just bite
26:53
the bullet, slick it off, no value, pay the money and reforest it, or wait and see
27:01
if it would become merchantable hardwoods.
27:04
And at that point, alder was just starting to become a merchantable species.
27:10
So, most of the foresters didn't have much of an idea of the value of it.
27:18
What about some of the other hardwoods that would grow in, shall
27:23
we say, cut areas or along stream beds, alder, plus what are some
27:27
of the other species of hardwoods?
27:29
Pretty much, maple was the only other hardwood on the Coast Range
27:33
that was found in any amount at all.
27:37
Now, how would that compare to the west slope of the Cascades?
27:41
West slope of the Cascades has much more maple, much less merchantable alder.
27:49
And "merchantable" alder is basically based on just the size, right?
27:52
Size.
27:52
Right.
27:53
Size and height to some extent, but yes.
27:55
What do we use alder for usually?
27:57
Most wood goes into furniture and cabinets.
28:03
What was the use of chemicals back then?
28:05
When you first started working out in the field, you were in the Coast
28:10
Range, how heavily were chemicals used in herbicides for whatever?
28:15
We were using them very heavily.
28:20
The Forest Service was actually ahead of the curve in terms of their use.
28:26
They were ahead of industry in terms of reforesting Coast Range
28:32
and Cascades' conditions, when there was a lot of it used.
28:36
Now, you're talking about Forest Service land in contrast to
28:41
private forest land, right?
28:42
Right.
28:43
That's what you mean, like Weyerhaeuser or Georgia Pacific owns private land?
28:47
Right, yes.
28:47
At that point, the Forest Service was doing a lot of herbicide use
28:53
to get those stands reforested.
28:58
The industry was much less so.
29:03
They hadn't seen the value of
29:09
better stocking of
29:12
the conifers.
29:14
How would herbicides help regeneration and reforestation?
29:19
And what were some of the concerns that maybe developed over long-term effects
29:23
of chemicals leaching into the soil and into the watershed, for instance?
29:27
The
29:29
Coast Range particularly, grows everything really well.
29:36
Alder and brush species cannot compete with Douglas-fir and hemlock trees
29:44
the first five years, really easily.
29:48
So, if you wanted to get a good stand of conifers, you had to
29:52
do something about the brush.
29:54
Because the seedlings wouldn't have any light, there'd be no light?
29:56
They just wouldn't, they wouldn't have any light.
29:57
Yeah.
29:58
I mean, it was, you had to control in
30:04
a lot of places, had to control either the
30:10
brush or the alder, the first couple years, in order to get the trees up
30:16
enough to where they could out-compete.
30:21
And this was also a time when
30:27
Congress was concerned about the lack of reforestation, successful
30:31
reforestation on national forests.
30:33
And a few years after that, had actually put in a 10-year directive to the Forest
30:41
Service to get those places reforested.
30:44
So, prior to that, the Forest Service had done a similar or worse job as
30:49
industry in getting stuff reforested, and they had started to turn that around.
30:55
What were the laws at that time about reforestation, in comparison to
31:03
internal directives with the Forest Service about reforesting how and
31:07
when and how many years after harvest?
31:10
So, at that point, there were no laws requiring reforestation.
31:16
It wasn't until NFMA [National Forest Management Act] about 1976,
31:20
as I recall, that the five-year requirement was put into law.
31:26
But Congress was already looking at the lack of reforestation
31:31
on national forest lands.
31:34
And why would that be?
31:38
Weren't contracts written with that as a requirement?
31:41
Oh, no.
31:42
They weren't?
31:42
Okay.
31:43
No,
31:46
the harvest contracts were separate from reforestation.
31:50
And so you would eventually, but usually there was no quid pro quo where the
31:54
company that got the sale was expected to
31:58
replant?
31:58
Oh, no.
31:58
You didn't?
31:59
It was the Forest Service's responsibility to do that, and they
32:03
would subcontract out usually, correct?
32:05
It was the Forest Service.
32:05
Yes,
32:07
the Forest Service, until very recently with some of the stewardship
32:11
contracts, has never tied the harvest contract to the reforestation contract.
32:16
So, what are some of the reasons for the big, long lag effects, even after
32:23
the 1976 Act, which required it, because you still see a lot of areas where
32:27
they're not being reforested quickly?
32:32
It takes time for trees to grow.
32:35
And I have had foresters ask me, how come I haven't planted a chunk of ground.
32:40
And they said, "We planted it three years ago. Get out on the ground and
32:43
walk." So, for somebody who's not a forester, it probably takes 10 years
32:48
before you actually see the trees, before you recognize that there's trees.
32:52
In other words, if you're looking from a distance on a hillside, it's
32:55
not going to look like it's been reforested until it's at least 10 years?
32:58
Yeah, yeah.
32:59
Okay.
33:02
Segueing kind of to where we are now here in the upper McKenzie River Valley,
33:06
some of these really high slopes around here look like they might be struggling
33:10
to be successfully reforested, or is that just merely because they're
33:13
in that first 5-10-year new growth?
33:14
They're probably in the first 5-10 years, for the most part.
33:19
We don't have very many places in this valley that are
33:24
terribly difficult to reforest.
33:25
You know, we have places that are very rocky and so on, that are
33:28
difficult, but for the most part, they're relatively easily reforested.
33:36
Okay.
33:38
So, tell me about what did you do after that first year-and-a-half of
33:42
seasonal work, how did you transition into a career Forest Service person?
33:47
They finally picked me up as a permanent, as a technician.
33:51
And unfortunately, at that point, the Forest Service wouldn't convert
33:56
a technician even though they were qualified, to a forester position.
34:02
Even though Civil Service rules would allow them to do it, they wouldn't do it.
34:07
Within a couple years, some folks filed
34:14
some protests, basically with the Civil Service Commission, and forced the
34:18
Forest Service to consider anybody who was qualified for forester positions.
34:26
Additionally, at that point, the Forest Service probably hired almost
34:29
zero folks between about '70 and
34:38
'76.
34:38
The funding for the Forest Service was so low, they weren't
34:41
hiring any new employees.
34:43
And that was, indirectly at least, related to Vietnam?
34:47
Yeah.
34:48
And then federal expenditures started up.
34:50
Yeah.
34:51
And, of course, the 1976 Act combined with NEPA and all the different acts that
34:57
changed the entire political landscape, made it necessary for the Forest
35:02
Service to hire more people, and also a different type, or different types,
35:08
of specialists, aside from foresters?
35:08
Yeah, aside from foresters, yes.
35:16
Right.
35:16
And part of that, the
35:20
budget for the Forest Service went way up.
35:23
A
35:26
lot of that I believe was due to a couple of
35:31
Oregon "congress-critters" who were
35:37
high up, had
35:44
important chairmanships, who in addition to Packwood and Hatfield,
35:47
strongly supported the Forest Service and good forest management.
35:48
Yes.
35:48
They supported forestry, so those folks would actually bump up the
35:54
Forest Service requested budget.
36:00
An unrequested boost?
36:01
Yes.
36:03
Not that it wasn't appreciated, but,
36:07
the administration tells the Forest Service how much they can ask for.
36:13
So, they do and those two would make sure that they were funded more.
36:21
There also was more of the push to harvest to the sustained-yield
36:30
levels, so there are budgets to
36:36
do that.
36:37
And of course, that was really before the whole NEPA, Wilderness Act, the whole
36:42
- Well, the Wilderness Act,
36:46
yes.
36:46
But I mean that the infrastructure had to change to address the political
36:52
economic cultural "thing" that developed out of new laws and culture shifts.
36:56
Yeah, I would like to point out that the Forest Service actually had
37:00
created its own wilderness areas.
37:02
They called them primitive areas at the time.
37:04
That goes way back to the '20s and '30s.
37:06
Yeah, that they had no intention of harvesting in any way.
37:11
And most of those became wilderness areas.
37:14
So, I think folks for the most part don't recognize that the Forest
37:19
Service was really in the forefront of
37:23
protection of special areas, including the Grand Canyon.
37:30
Yes.
37:30
I believe it was 1906, Teddy Roosevelt, as part of his increase of the forest
37:36
reserves, included the Grand Canyon of all things, a wildlife area that was
37:44
administered by the Forest Service.
37:47
In 1910, the second Chief of the Forest Service, 1910-1912, Graves [Henry] , nixed
37:57
a dam in the middle of the Grand Canyon.
38:01
It blows me away that the Chief of the Forest Service could tell the Bureau
38:04
of Reclamation, "No, you're not going to put a dam in there and get away with
38:14
it."
38:14
Anyway, you're continuing about the Forest Service and its efforts at,
38:20
shall we say, preservation, which it's not often thought of doing.
38:23
Right, yeah.
38:23
I mean, especially, in comparison to the other agencies and how
38:27
people look at history especially?
38:29
Yeah.
38:30
Now, the Forest Service in the '60s and into the '70s had that tension between
38:37
those who wanted to harvest anything that was harvestable and those who
38:42
wanted to set some aside for recreation.
38:45
But I think you're going to get that in any large organization.
38:49
You have differences of opinion about what ought to be done.
38:51
Exactly.
38:53
But for the most part, like I said, it was those Forest Service
38:58
primitive areas that became wildernesses under the Wilderness Act.
39:02
And then
39:04
all of the other, Wilderness Act road-less areas, all of that stuff, happened later.
39:09
We may talk about that later.
39:12
When you entered the Forest Service, how would you describe the esprit de
39:17
corps, the culture of the Forest Service?
39:23
I'd say it was
39:27
everybody pretty much working together.
39:29
If somebody needed some help, you went out and helped him if you had time to do it.
39:37
You know, early, I was in silviculture, but that didn't mean I wouldn't go
39:42
out and help the marking crew if they needed help, or go out and help the
39:47
fire crew if they needed help burning.
39:48
You know, it was just part of the deal.
39:51
But if somebody needed help and you had time, you helped him.
39:55
Then, in terms of the cultural reputation, both internally and externally, there
40:02
was that almost military, but it was more than that, pride in the organization?
40:09
Yes.
40:11
[Break in audio]
40:11
Continuing on the question before.
40:14
Oh, I'd say we had a very high esprit de corps, and for the most part, we
40:21
were viewed as a relatively good agency.
40:25
You know, there were some loggers that hated us because we thought they
40:28
ought to do a better job logging, but that's the kind of the "weed-down"
40:34
thing that you get just about anywhere.
40:38
But the environmental dynamic hadn't yet developed?
40:43
Actually
40:43
-- Maybe a little bit?
40:44
It had on the Siuslaw.
40:46
Oh, it did, okay.
40:48
We had the infamous folks down at Deadwood that were harassing
40:54
us about the herbicide use.
40:57
And that's one of the areas where they used my expertise.
41:03
They put me on a project to research all the herbicide stuff, of the herbicides
41:12
we were using, to see if they truly were a problem.
41:16
And found out for the most part, no, because we weren't using the stuff
41:22
the Army had been using in Vietnam.
41:24
The stuff the Army had been using in Vietnam
41:30
was done by a manufacturer who didn't pay attention to the processes.
41:35
You're talking about Agent Orange?
41:37
Agent Orange, yeah.
41:38
So, 2, 4, 5-T, if it's manufactured at too high a level, produces lots of dioxins.
41:45
And that's what the issue was in Vietnam.
41:50
And it's also when you have a lot of soldiers coming home with
41:52
long-term health problems, right?
41:54
Right, yeah.
41:56
The stuff produced for commercial use in the U.S. didn't have those.
42:00
Okay.
42:01
So, that part of it, you know, the truly toxic stuff wasn't in what we were using.
42:09
Now, there's a different philosophy about whether you
42:11
should be using herbicides at all.
42:14
But from the standpoint of toxicity, the stuff we were using degraded as it should
42:21
have, and we weren't using anything that
42:27
had a long life in the soil or anything.
42:30
They were all very soil active, and broke down rapidly in the soil.
42:38
So, what was your first permanent posting?
42:43
Beautiful downtown Bly, Oregon.
42:46
No, actually, my first permanent posting was at Siuslaw as a technician,
42:51
but first on the inventory, and then out on the Alsea District.
42:56
And when was that, from what years?
42:58
So, '70, I was in the Siuslaw, so '72-'73, the Alsea, '74-'75
43:12
into '76.
43:15
And then, I got a permanent position as forester on the Bly District.
43:20
And excuse my ignorance, but where is Bly?
43:24
Halfway between Klamath Falls and Lakeview.
43:27
Okay.
43:28
In the middle of
43:29
-- Middle of nowhere.
43:30
Nowhere.
43:31
[Laughter]
43:35
I'm glad we agreed on
43:38
that.
43:40
So that was my first permanent post as a forester.
43:42
And how would you describe the ecology, the geography of that region?
43:47
Basin and Range Province.
43:54
Relatively dry forest.
43:58
Ponderosa pine predominated.
44:00
We had a fair amount of lodgepole pine, so on the dryer side.
44:04
We had some
44:08
true firs that shouldn't have been there.
44:11
There had been a series of wetter years without any fire, and so the range
44:18
of White Fir had expanded greatly.
44:23
It was interesting, because there were places there that when I was there
44:26
in '77-'80, and '81, I thought, true firs would be a good crop tree there.
44:40
Went back in 2001, stomped over some of the same ground, and saw a 30-inch
44:47
true fir that had died from the drought.
44:51
So, in that region, I would guess that the only true firs, or shall we say, trees
44:57
that needed higher moisture precipitation levels, would be found maybe in the
45:02
higher areas like Gearhart Mountain or
45:05
--? Not quite as high as Gearhart, but yeah, the higher elevation.
45:08
Or the Warner Range or those different mountains around there?
45:10
Yeah, the Gearhart, Warners, and what we call the
45:16
Black Hills.
45:17
It's west of Gearhart, but a higher range of mountains.
45:25
That was a pretty-remote place to live, wasn't it?
45:28
It was.
45:30
But at the time, Weyerhaeuser had a big mill there.
45:34
So, there were probably 800 or 1,000 people living in the Bly
45:41
area, so it wasn't much, you know, you pretty much had to go to
45:45
Klamath Falls to do your shopping.
45:46
But, there were a couple small grocery stores, a couple gas stations.
45:51
You could get immediate needs right there in Bly.
45:57
How did science and forestry even beyond what you were trained in school,
46:04
start to enter forestry as you saw it being practiced, administered, framed
46:09
by the debates that were going on at that time, the '70s, early '80s?
46:15
I ended up being one of those folks that continued learning.
46:20
So, I continued looking for the research papers that would help me to
46:27
quantify the things I ought to be doing.
46:30
You know, when I started as a forester, you thinned by taking
46:34
out, yeah, a third of it.
46:36
Oh, it was just like
46:39
-- Seat-of-pants.
46:40
Guesstimate.
46:41
It was guesstimate.
46:41
It was seat-of-the-pants.
46:46
Very little was known about, really, about stocking levels.
46:50
We had a little bit of stuff, but it was pretty primitive.
46:52
I always wanted to do a better job, so I kept up with the literature
46:59
more than other folks did.
47:02
So, I'd say, throughout my career, I paid attention to the literature.
47:04
Now, did you ever go back and get a master's?
47:06
I did.
47:07
And when did that happen?
47:11
When the
47:15
Region 6, our region, started having formal training in silviculture.
47:21
For some reason, I was able to get into the first class, which was amazing,
47:25
because most folks in there had been forest silviculturists for several years.
47:31
So that I think there was only two or three of us in that first class
47:34
that weren't forest silviculturists.
47:36
Was this also at OSU?
47:38
It was OSU and University of Washington.
47:42
It was a joint-program at that point.
47:44
Okay.
47:44
So, where did you attend classes then?
47:46
Both OSU and University of Washington.
47:48
So you went between Corvallis and Seattle?
47:50
Yes.
47:51
Now, was this during this '77-'81 period, or right after that?
47:55
It started in '80-'81.
47:59
So, at the end of your
48:00
-- Oh, '79?
48:00
'79-'80 somewhere, is when it started.
48:03
So, you were transitioning when you were still stationed at Bly then?
48:04
Yeah.
48:07
So, now that I think about it, I went through most of the classwork when I
48:12
was at Bly.
48:13
Then did my oral.
48:16
So, your master's was also in forestry?
48:18
Yes, silviculture.
48:20
Silviculture.
48:21
And how would you describe that content versus what you learned
48:26
before as an undergraduate?
48:29
Very difficult, but also very difficult, more than even the normal grad student.
48:36
I was able to use some of my classes with the silviculture
48:40
training as graduate credits.
48:45
Then University of Washington actually made it really easy and let me
48:53
attend without going to classes.
48:55
So, I did directed studies for the rest of my credits.
48:59
And of course, this was before the internet, so your extension studies
49:03
had a little different connotation.
49:05
Yes.
49:06
And how did you do that?
49:07
You mailed papers in?
49:09
We mailed papers back and forth, the profs would send me some stuff to read, and then
49:15
I'd read it and basically do a thorough report on it, and shipped it back.
49:20
And so, it was all mail.
49:22
And there was no email.
49:26
"Snail mail."
49:27
Snail mail, yeah.
49:29
So, do you have any mentors during that period that, people that
49:34
came out, any intellectual heroes?
49:36
I mean, Jerry Franklin, you know him, and he was at OSU [Corvallis-
49:40
Forest Service and OSU] then.
49:40
Yeah.
49:40
He was at OSU.
49:41
He ended up going to Washington shortly after this.
49:42
Yeah,
49:51
that's horrible.
49:52
I'm going to have trouble remembering.
49:53
So,
49:58
my three committee members were
50:04
somewhat mentors in terms of helping me work through this process and helped
50:09
me to learn what I wanted to learn.
50:13
My focus at that time was probably forest nutrition.
50:18
And of course, they took me way beyond just fertilization,
50:23
which really opened some eyes.
50:25
So, as a professional, how did you view yourself, as coming out
50:29
new and better, and in what way?
50:32
Probably
50:35
better able to critically look at research papers, evaluate kind of the background
50:44
of research to see how much of it might actually apply to what I was doing.
50:50
And
50:53
in some cases, critical enough that I'd say, "Huh, I wouldn't
50:59
have come to that conclusion." So, I'd say, critical thinking.
51:07
Now, where did you go after Bly?
51:11
From Bly, I went to Lowell District on the Willamette in silviculture
51:19
and timber sale planning.
51:21
So, you worked in the district office then?
51:24
Yes.
51:25
And what was your typical menu of work, what were you tasked to do?
51:32
Supporting the timber planning effort for the most part.
51:36
But also, any of the NEPA things the silviculture department needed
51:42
to do, I was responsible for that.
51:45
So, particular herbicide
51:48
use at that point.
51:49
Was that your first experience with EISs and
51:55
EAs?
51:55
My first experience was when we called them EAs.
51:58
At Bly, we had what we called the "Environmental Analysis" reports.
52:03
And during that period, it seemed like every six months, the Forest
52:09
Service would change what we were calling it, and what we did to do it.
52:13
So,
52:16
from
52:18
'77 through '83 or '84, there was big
52:25
turnover semi-annually, of how we approached things in terms
52:30
of the environmental analysis.
52:34
Yeah, I believe what even some agencies, for instance, the Park Service called
52:39
an EIS [Environmental Impact Statements] in the early days, wouldn't even pass
52:42
muster 10-20 years later as a remedial EA.
52:46
Right, right.
52:47
I mean, the sophistication increase was mandated by many factors.
52:52
You're right.
52:53
In all these agencies, it happened.
52:55
Yeah, yeah.
52:58
Now, what do you remember about
53:03
the researchers and the science, specifically places like the H.J.
53:08
Andrews Forest, other experimental forests, there was also the South
53:12
Umpqua, and you had Pringle Falls?
53:15
Yeah.
53:15
Cascade Head, other ones around, how did you view when you first came in and
53:22
as you're developing as a professional over this really-formative, 10-year
53:25
period of time, which includes your masters, where you're becoming much
53:30
more aware of all of these things?
53:32
Yeah, so, in terms of the experimental forests, the two
53:36
that were active in Oregon were Pringle Falls and H.J. Andrews.
53:42
The others were, I'd say, active in terms of outreach.
53:49
The silvicultural lab at Bend was very good, about hosting
53:56
two or three-day workshops for eastern Oregon, particularly.
54:04
And that would have applied very much to what you were doing down in Bly at that
54:07
time, and the Pringle Falls, specifically?
54:09
Yeah.
54:09
OSU
54:13
was doing the same thing for west side stuff, not necessarily focused
54:18
on the Andrews, but occasionally
54:24
you'd do stuff there.
54:25
But it wasn't nearly as developed then.
54:29
When was the first time that you heard about the Andrews and when was the
54:33
first time you actually went there?
54:36
Probably during my, let me think, I
54:47
may have heard about in school, but it's foggy enough that I
54:50
don't know that we went there.
54:52
You know, we took some field trips, but it's foggy enough that
54:55
I'm not sure we got there or not.
54:58
During the silviculture training, and so, in late '79-'80,
55:05
we went there as part of, as a field trip.
55:09
This is part of your master's then?
55:10
Yeah, well, yeah, it turned out being part, the part of the
55:14
silviculture training for becoming a "certified silviculturist."
55:17
Now, do you remember meeting some of the people up there at the Andrews?
55:22
Yeah, we met then, you know, I remember some of the professors,
55:28
Dick Waring, particularly.
55:31
Now, he was one of the really-important people at the
55:35
Andrews before it became an LTER site.
55:37
Right, yeah.
55:39
His knowledge of tree physiology and the practicality of how he
55:45
got it across in terms of what it meant, really impressed me.
55:51
So, you were really impressed with Dick Waring.
55:53
Do you remember meeting Jerry Franklin at that time?
55:56
Yeah.
55:57
Actually, I had actually met Franklin when I was working at Alsea.
56:04
He was a Scout Master or something, and they wanted some trees planted,
56:08
so I took some trees out to him and helped the scouts plant some trees.
56:11
So, I had exposure to him early in my career.
56:14
And he was, even then, he was a force to be reckoned with in forestry.
56:21
You know, he was a known entity and well-respected.
56:28
His career is incredible.
56:29
Yeah.
56:30
The production.
56:32
I mean, he's beloved, he's revered, he's also controversial, he's many things.
56:40
But an engine of research, though.
56:43
Yeah.
56:45
And he's impacted all, anybody who's done forestry.
56:49
I mean, not just at OSU and Washington, but anywhere, absolutely.
56:55
Yeah.
56:55
Now, describe the key paradigms in forestry that you obviously learned
56:59
as a student, multiple-use and its derivatives, sustained-yields, all the
57:04
Gifford Pinchot playbook type stuff that's central to forestry, even in South
57:11
America where I know something about.
57:14
It's been copied world-wide.
57:17
But how would you describe the adaptation of those basic paradigms over the
57:23
first fifteen years of your career, from the '70s into the early-mid-'80s?
57:28
So, during that period, obviously, we got the NFMA [National
57:33
Forest Management Act] that
57:39
put down in law some of the things that we should have been doing anyway.
57:43
And frankly, my reading of NFMA is that the Forest Service sent
57:47
it to the Congress so it would be
57:56
institutionalized.
57:57
The 1976 Act, you're talking about.
57:59
Right?
57:59
Yeah, yeah.
58:01
And how did that differ from the 1960 Act [Multiple Use] , which was the operative
58:06
act when you first came into that?
58:07
Yeah, the '60s act was really a "wise-use,"
58:14
but it was "use" almost exclusively.
58:17
It didn't recognize ecosystems
58:26
as such, that there were things going on out there other than trees.
58:32
So, the '70s act started getting into managing for other resources
58:39
other than consumable items.
58:42
You know, the '60s act was consumable items, really, water,
58:48
wood, wildlife, recreation,
58:53
range.
58:53
Right.
58:54
And how do you remember you, yourself, looking at forests differently during
58:59
that first 15 years, where you obviously were still trained in that, you were
59:04
aware of environmental things that were going on, but you were still trained
59:08
as an old-school, multiple-use guy.
59:10
But you were changing along with the times.
59:12
Correct?
59:13
You know, I was a product of my time.
59:17
So, even while I was being trained in forestry, I also was aware of other
59:28
non-monetary values of forests.
59:31
So, I think, even early on, I recognized that
59:37
just because it's good in one place, doesn't mean it's good everywhere.
59:39
So, you never looked at the forest just as a crop?
59:43
No, no.
59:46
But in terms of the more sophisticated science, ecosystem management, the
59:50
"whole," what was done at the Andrews?
59:53
You know, obviously, as time went on and as researchers got more data and
59:58
put it out there, then I incorporated that stuff into my thinking.
1:00:03
When I graduated from college,
1:00:08
I supposed Forsman [Eric] knew about spotted owls, but there wasn't
1:00:11
anybody else in the world that did.
1:00:14
You know, we just didn't know what we didn't know.
1:00:18
And when's the first time you met Eric?
1:00:21
You know, I don't think I ever did.
1:00:23
You're never met Eric?
1:00:24
No, no.
1:00:24
Oh, okay.
1:00:25
I mean, I've probably been at a room where he was speaking, but I've never met him.
1:00:31
But when did you first hear about his work and that of his progeny,
1:00:37
and of course, what would eventually result in the Dwyer injunction and
1:00:41
all the changes after the fact?
1:00:43
[ESA, spotted owl, injunction against harvests]
1:00:43
. Probably about the time I went to Lowell.
1:00:47
That's when it was starting to get known.
1:00:53
Did you even know what a spotted owl was before this whole thing?
1:00:56
No, no.
1:00:58
There were owls, right?
1:00:59
There were owls, yeah.
1:01:01
And you know,
1:01:05
there were owls and I knew there were different species, and it
1:01:07
didn't matter to me, you know?
1:01:10
But you didn't know what an indicator species was at that time?
1:01:13
No, there wasn't even, people hadn't even come up with that concept.
1:01:18
Right.
1:01:19
So,
1:01:24
you were at Lowell [Ranger District] . Let's go back to that.
1:01:26
You were doing silviculture.
1:01:27
How long were you stationed there?
1:01:29
Five years, basically.
1:01:31
And now, if my read of the Willamette National Forest history is correct,
1:01:36
that was still at that time the highest yield area within the district, is
1:01:42
that correct, or within the forest?
1:01:46
Probably on a per-acre basis, it was probably highest yield.
1:01:50
It was a small district, so it didn't produce as much as other
1:01:55
districts on the Willamette.
1:01:57
But the entire Willamette was get the wood out, basically [#1 nationally in
1:02:04
forests-production] . It was focused on meeting the timber volume, timber
1:02:09
targets, and much less interested in meeting other values of the forest.
1:02:17
Who was the district ranger when you were there?
1:02:20
Tommy Thompson.
1:02:23
And describe your
1:02:26
- I didn't have a whole lot of direct interaction with him.
1:02:30
He seemed to be a
1:02:34
decent guy, decent ranger.
1:02:37
Now, what about forest supervisors?
1:02:42
So, the one I remember is Kerrick [Mike] . I don't think he was forest
1:02:46
[Willamette National Forest] supervisor when I first got there, but probably
1:02:49
within a couple years after getting there, he became forest supervisor there.
1:02:53
I'm not positive on that, but that's my recollection.
1:02:56
And what do you remember about the relationship between the
1:02:59
supervisor's office and the districts, and how that changed?
1:03:05
At my level, I really, in terms of the supervisor's office, I
1:03:11
dealt with the silviculture staff.
1:03:13
I didn't even really deal with the timber management staff.
1:03:19
So, I'd say, it was technical forestry.
1:03:26
I was somewhat aware of the interactions, but not involved
1:03:31
in them, so I really didn't know.
1:03:35
Okay, now, two more "green" questions, if you want, philosophical questions.
1:03:43
When do you first remember hearing the word ecology?
1:03:48
Oh, in college.
1:03:50
In college?
1:03:51
Yeah.
1:03:51
And what did that word mean for you then, and how did that change?
1:03:59
When I was in college, it had more to do with the, what I'd
1:04:04
say the technical aspects of
1:04:11
systems, forest systems, range systems, whatever.
1:04:15
How the different plants and animals interacted.
1:04:18
So, it was more of a technical view of it, rather than a philosophical
1:04:24
or political view of it.
1:04:28
But how did that change over time?
1:04:30
Well, it became the
1:04:34
more of a political statement.
1:04:37
You know, ecology became more of a political statement rather than a
1:04:42
biological statement.
1:04:45
You know,
1:04:50
the ecosystem movement became more of a political movement rather than a movement
1:04:56
focused on how systems really worked.
1:04:59
Right.
1:05:00
How about the same for environment?
1:05:03
Same, the same.
1:05:04
Or environmental?
1:05:05
Environmental...the same.
1:05:07
Environmental and ecology were kind of wrapped up together.
1:05:11
What do you remember about when you first heard the word conservation or
1:05:15
conservationist, what did that mean to you, and how did that change?
1:05:21
So again, I was exposed to that probably even in high school.
1:05:26
And conservation was really wise-use of the resource, rather
1:05:32
than preservation of the resource.
1:05:34
And then, I'd say, the preservation groups co-opted that, conservation
1:05:44
means preservation, rather than a wise-use of the resource.
1:05:47
Yeah.
1:05:48
And conservation often became a euphemism for the "old way."
1:05:53
Yeah.
1:05:54
Exactly.
1:05:55
Now, how would you characterize your environmental ethic and
1:05:59
philosophy at the start of your career, and how did that evolve?
1:06:13
I'd say it evolved from the standpoint of getting more knowledge about
1:06:18
systems and specific species and requirements, that sort of thing.
1:06:25
I think I've always had a feeling that we needed to manage our forest as a
1:06:32
forest rather than as a timber farm.
1:06:39
You know, and a forest being a complex of organisms, plant and animal.
1:06:46
Now, we know how that political debate has played out, out here in society.
1:06:50
How did you see the political and cultural shifts being played out where you were
1:06:57
operating within the Forest Service?
1:07:00
I was very disappointed in our leadership, that couldn't tell
1:07:05
that we were strapped to a
1:07:11
rail line and that there was a freight train coming at us.
1:07:15
You know, as a young forester, I could put ESA and spotted owls in
1:07:22
the same sentence, and recognized what it was going to do to us.
1:07:26
So, you recognized that even before Dwyer's injunction?
1:07:31
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
1:07:32
You know, at Lowell, we were involved in that argument, the 100 acres, and
1:07:38
then 2,500 acres was way too much to set aside for the spotted owl.
1:07:42
And I'm thinking, "If we don't manage it, we're going to lose the whole
1:07:47
thing." Which we ended up doing.
1:07:49
In other words, the Northwest Forest Plan, and of course, even the injunction
1:07:54
effectively stopped many things?
1:07:57
Yeah.
1:07:58
I personally felt and still feel, that we could probably manage more of our forests,
1:08:06
and probably ought to manage more of our forests, including harvesting, than we are
1:08:12
now, and we'd probably be more effective at managing for spotted owls and so on.
1:08:20
That would require us to go to very long rotations.
1:08:25
What was
1:08:30
the normal rotation when you came in?
1:08:32
Sixty to eighty years.
1:08:33
And that was for the west slope of the Cascades?
1:08:35
West slope of the Cascades.
1:08:36
Is that the same for the Siuslaw and the Coast Range?
1:08:39
Yeah.
1:08:40
How about for over in Bly, where it's got a different climate?
1:08:44
Hundred, 120.
1:08:44
So, it was a longer cycle then?
1:08:46
Well, yeah.
1:08:46
So, you think that the cycles need to go more toward the longer cycles,
1:08:50
even for the wet, moister climes?
1:08:52
Yeah.
1:08:52
I think
1:08:55
in order to recognize the needs of old-growth-dependent species,
1:09:00
we probably need something like a 350 or 400-year rotation.
1:09:05
So that at any point, about half of the forest is in an older condition.
1:09:11
And I think we could do that.
1:09:15
Technically, we can do that.
1:09:17
Politically, we've shown that we can't.
1:09:21
But you know, we have trouble keeping our plans together for 10 years, let alone for
1:09:31
400.
1:09:31
In 1989, I made a proposal to the Umpqua National Forest.
1:09:38
I was working there then.
1:09:43
We were going through the forest planning process and I said, "Guys, we need
1:09:46
to go to a 350-year rotation. We will drop the harvest by about 25 percent."
1:09:56
And that was just too much for them.
1:09:58
So, instead, we went to a 90 percent reduction in harvest.
1:10:04
So, in other words, you feel that if the Forest Service had adopted a much
1:10:10
longer-range horizon on rotations, that some of the absolute things
1:10:18
that happened later would have not happened, or would have been lessened?
1:10:21
I think it would have been lessened.
1:10:22
Maybe not happened at all.
1:10:25
I think a big part of the problem was that the Forest Service was
1:10:29
unwilling to recognize when it needed to change, before somebody made them
1:10:35
change during that period of time.
1:10:38
And that greatly exacerbated the issue.
1:10:43
You know, go back to the primitive areas that the Forest Service set
1:10:48
aside, well, when those primitive areas became wilderness areas, it was for
1:10:55
the most part, no big deal, because we were already managing them that way.
1:11:00
I think if we had recognized the need for old-growth-dependent species earlier,
1:11:07
like really, we knew in the early '80s, if you thought about it, that
1:11:11
we needed to do something like that.
1:11:14
If we had done that, we very well could have, I think, forced all
1:11:21
or a lot of the issues in terms of
1:11:27
having spotted owls be put on the endangered species list.
1:11:32
How do you view "New Forestry," segueing from what you were
1:11:37
talking about right now?
1:11:38
We talked about Jerry Franklin earlier, but it's along the lines
1:11:41
of what we're talking about.
1:11:42
Why don't you just talk about New Forestry and how that fits into
1:11:45
your evolving thought process in the
1:11:53
'80s?
1:11:55
New Forestry was and is an attempt to look at different ways of managing,
1:12:02
and I think we ought to do that.
1:12:04
I don't think we have enough data to know what our
1:12:17
timber yield from that might be, but that's a technical issue.
1:12:21
I think we know much better now how trees grow under various light conditions to
1:12:27
be able to predict what they will do under these different conditions, and
1:12:36
they are based on what folks have looked at in terms of past-history
1:12:44
of natural forest conditions.
1:12:48
So, natural fire conditions and what came up afterwards and so on, they do
1:12:53
mimic those to one extent or another.
1:12:58
That standpoint would be a good place to start in terms of
1:13:05
trying to think about different ways of managing our forests.
1:13:09
Regarding old growth and the historical changes in its meaning,
1:13:10
when do you first remember
1:13:16
first hearing that term?
1:13:18
Oh, boy, back in college.
1:13:21
You know, that's an old term.
1:13:25
Different connotations.
1:13:27
In a related tag, when do you first remember hearing New Forestry?
1:13:32
[ecosystem-based forestry] . For example, as a formal thing?
1:13:35
Well, that was when Franklin was talking about New Forestry, probably in the
1:13:39
early '80s or something like that?
1:13:41
Maybe late '70s.
1:13:43
Did that sound attractive to you, or were you thinking along the same lines?
1:13:48
It was attractive to me from the standpoint of wanting to manage
1:13:53
the forest for a variety of values.
1:13:56
So, yeah.
1:13:58
And what do you remember the "old-guard" folks in the Forest Service
1:14:02
responding to these newfangled ideas?
1:14:05
They didn't respond very well at all.
1:14:08
They pretty much rejected most of that.
1:14:11
And was
1:14:13
this thoughtful rejections, or was it dismissive?
1:14:16
I think it was just a knee-jerk reaction to it.
1:14:23
Unfortunately, a good number of people learn something and that's the way it is,
1:14:29
and they don't maintain their learning.
1:14:33
So, it's as thought processes change, they don't change with it.
1:14:39
And the Forest Service is no different than
1:14:41
-- I think you're describing the human condition?
1:14:43
Yes.
1:14:43
Yes, I am.
1:14:44
In most cases.
1:14:46
I think most people tend to be, they get one set of ideologies and beliefs,
1:14:51
and that's what they live with.
1:14:53
Yeah.
1:14:53
You know, and they may adapt a little bit, but the original
1:14:55
ideas remain their foundation.
1:14:57
It's tough to change.
1:14:58
It is.
1:14:58
Change is hard.
1:14:59
Yeah.
1:15:03
Now, what do you remember about
1:15:06
environmentalism, which became this thing that was developing all around everybody?
1:15:15
Because of my broader views, I was attracted to environmentalism to begin
1:15:20
with, until I realized that it wasn't environmentalism, it was a catch-phrase to
1:15:31
preserve everything as it is.
1:15:34
And being a forester, I knew darn well that things change.
1:15:38
You know, you can't preserve things as-is.
1:15:42
It's going to change, no matter what you do.
1:15:45
And when folks started saying,
1:15:50
"Look at all this neat wood I've got in my house. Don't cut that tree."
1:15:56
It pretty much turned me off to that.
1:15:58
So, how did you reconcile yourself as a long-term, conservation-minded person,
1:16:06
who was also a forester, with your initial attraction and then caution
1:16:12
and even rejection, and kind of being in the middle of all these forces?
1:16:16
How did you reconcile those?
1:16:18
I did my best to make changes.
1:16:21
Back to the Umpqua.
1:16:26
When I made that presentation, they were looking at 70-80-year rotations.
1:16:32
One of the ticklers
1:16:36
I put at them, because I knew what was important to the Umpqua, was financing.
1:16:40
I pointed out that you could actually reduce your output by
1:16:48
harvesting larger trees because you've got more volume per acre.
1:16:53
You had to go fewer acres.
1:16:55
And at the end of my presentation, the forest sup [supervisor] was Bob Devlin
1:17:01
at the time, he said, "Well, we're not going to 350-year rotations." Then
1:17:05
he turned to his planner and said, "Look at longer rotations." So, the
1:17:10
result of that is we went to 120-year rotations on the Umpqua instead.
1:17:13
Well, it was a compromise.
1:17:15
It was a compromise, and frankly, a 40-year difference is a big deal.
1:17:22
So, I did have some influence there, just not as much as I had hoped for.
1:17:26
Now, you didn't talk about how you went from the Willamette to the Umpqua?
1:17:30
To the Umpqua, yeah.
1:17:31
And how long did that last?
1:17:34
So, I went to the Umpqua about '85,
1:17:39
and was there till '98,
1:17:43
13 years, something like that, on the Diamond Lake District.
1:17:47
Was the South Umpqua Experimental Forest still operating at that time?
1:17:51
Even by then, it wasn't operating.
1:17:53
It was pretty much out?
1:17:54
It was gone, yeah.
1:17:57
My impression of the South Umpqua, they had started doing some stuff
1:18:02
probably in the '70s, maybe earlier.
1:18:06
Much earlier than that.
1:18:06
Okay.
1:18:08
They had water monitoring and other monitoring stations, I believe,
1:18:13
in the '50s and early '60s.
1:18:14
Yeah, but by the time I was there, they weren't doing anything.
1:18:20
And that would have been a budget-related thing, I would guess.
1:18:24
Right?
1:18:24
Sure.
1:18:25
And, you know, as I like to say, how close are you to the university?
1:18:32
It does matter.
1:18:35
How much work the university does on your piece of ground is
1:18:37
inversely related to the distance.
1:18:41
The farther you are, you know, by
1:18:46
a square factor or something.
1:18:48
And it is a much longer drive from Corvallis to the South
1:18:51
Umpqua than it is to the Andrews?
1:18:53
Yes.
1:18:54
Like twice as long,
1:18:58
I would think.
1:18:58
Yes?
1:18:59
When I was down on the Fremont-Winema,
1:19:10
2001 through 2008, something like that,
1:19:20
fire researchers were looking for places that had had one, two and
1:19:26
three fires, over a given area.
1:19:28
Well, the Fremont-Winema has had its share.
1:19:33
So, I went to bat and found some areas, and shipped them off and they
1:19:39
would have been just fine areas.
1:19:41
And we were too far from them.
1:19:43
That isn't what they said.
1:19:46
But amazingly, they selected places within an hour or two drive of them,
1:19:52
versus one that was a six-hour drive.
1:19:55
That's usually the case.
1:19:56
Yeah,
1:19:59
I mean, that didn't surprise me.
1:20:02
Now, describe the difference between the Umpqua and the
1:20:05
Willamette in general terms.
1:20:08
In general terms, the Umpqua was a much more frugal forest.
1:20:14
Describe frugal.
1:20:16
They could get the job done for about half the price of the Willamette.
1:20:20
Why is that?
1:20:23
They didn't go in for the bells and whistles.
1:20:26
I mean, they were doing a fine job.
1:20:30
They're doing the job that needed to be done.
1:20:33
They just didn't put a lot of money into what some people might call frills.
1:20:39
And what would you mean, you mean equipment or
1:20:43
-- ? No, more outside training.
1:20:50
The
1:20:53
Umpqua would send you to outside training if it was pertinent to the job.
1:20:59
No problem.
1:21:02
The Willamette would send you to outside training if it was outside training.
1:21:08
That's one example.
1:21:09
Okay, I got you.
1:21:10
So, how was the ecology and silviculture dynamics different there?
1:21:17
Oh, boy.
1:21:19
Slightly drier, I think, but
1:21:21
-- ? Slightly drier, although, you know, the Cottage Grove District
1:21:25
is insignificantly different from the Lowell District, especially
1:21:28
on the southern grade-exposures.
1:21:31
So, the North Umpqua District is very much like the Oakridge area to
1:21:38
the southern end of the Willamette.
1:21:41
The
1:21:44
North Umpqua District, Diamond Lake District, is
1:21:51
higher elevation, but still had some South Willamette qualities that
1:21:57
continued into higher elevation.
1:21:59
So, where's the station over there at the Diamond Lake District?
1:22:02
A place called Toketee Falls.
1:22:07
So, you're about 20 miles from Diamond Lake?
1:22:10
Yeah.
1:22:12
It's beautiful country.
1:22:13
Beautiful country.
1:22:16
I probably could have stayed there forever.
1:22:19
Decided not to, but 16 or 17 commercial conifer species,
1:22:28
half-a-dozen non-commercial conifer species.
1:22:32
Half-a-dozen non-commercial hardwood species; 2,000-foot
1:22:39
elevation to 9,000-foot elevation.
1:22:42
So, just every time you went out, you were looking at something different, and you
1:22:46
had to be thinking and figuring out what to do on that piece of ground, because
1:22:50
it was different than over the hill.
1:22:52
It was just really a professionally interesting place to work.
1:22:57
Now, the population is relatively sparse?
1:23:00
Sparse?
1:23:01
[Laughs] It's the Forest Service.
1:23:03
No, but I mean, the Umpqua Valley is much less
1:23:06
- Oh, yeah.
1:23:08
The Umpqua
1:23:08
-- Populated than either the Willamette or the McKenzie, right?
1:23:11
Yeah, the Umpqua Valley was, and still is resource-oriented.
1:23:20
The environmental groups don't get much traction there.
1:23:26
The one time we had a protest on the Diamond Lake District,
1:23:33
the ranger
1:23:37
said, if they showed up on weekends, set up blockades, and so on.
1:23:43
The ranger thought about it about two minutes, and said, "Let's let them sit."
1:23:49
So, no controversy, no television stations.
1:23:55
By the end of the week, there were two people left.
1:23:59
Then law enforcement went in and said, "You guys got a choice. We'll
1:24:03
give you a ride to town voluntarily, or we'll give you a ride to the
1:24:08
jail." They chose the ride to town.
1:24:11
Was this the Douglas County Sheriffs?
1:24:13
Yeah, yeah.
1:24:15
And Roseburg is slightly more conservative.
1:24:17
[than Eugene, for example.]
1:24:17
Yes, yes.
1:24:19
So again, too far from population centers for the TV stations to
1:24:24
get involved, since there was no controversy, no face-to-face shouting.
1:24:31
So, I take it that from some of your other comments that you definitely see
1:24:36
the relationship between demographics, cultural attachments, environment,
1:24:43
and then even the inconsistencies that would exist versus a pure philosophical
1:24:50
view of whatever you're talking about.
1:24:52
Yes, yes.
1:24:53
That was kind of a convoluted question, but do you understand what I'm saying?
1:24:56
I think so.
1:24:57
They're very different populations, different focus.
1:25:05
You know, the Willamette has the U of O Law Center to harass them all the time.
1:25:11
The Umpqua, when I was there, had two people, I think,
1:25:15
that liked to fuss with us.
1:25:19
But there was no base of support there, really.
1:25:26
So, we could go out and do our business, and frankly, the Umpqua was doing fine.
1:25:32
But
1:25:37
it was protecting the areas that needed to be protected, and you know, it wasn't
1:25:41
out-of-control forestry by any means.
1:25:43
Definitely, still "Industrial Forestry." But the desire, not to
1:25:51
reduce harvest and that sort of thing.
1:25:54
Backtracking a bit.
1:25:56
Going back to the local communities and traditional resource uses you have been
1:26:04
exposed to, you know, you sought when you were a seasonal over in the Siuslaw,
1:26:08
but let's go to later when you were in these other more permanent locations.
1:26:16
How have you seen, you might want to, maybe single out a couple examples,
1:26:20
at Bly, Lowell, or Umpqua, and
1:26:26
how the local economics and cultures existed and changed, and even
1:26:34
in some cases collapsed, because of, whether it be purely economic
1:26:39
or political or what-have-you?
1:26:41
Give us some examples of that, and you were obviously the silviculture guy for
1:26:45
the Forest Service, you know, grading and deciding on tracts and what was going to
1:26:51
be harvested, at least, in some cases?
1:26:53
Just tell me what you saw.
1:26:54
So,
1:27:02
the Alsea District
1:27:08
based from Corvallis,
1:27:11
was resource-based, but you know, the community was resource-based.
1:27:17
Corvallis was an Ag College town, so it was more resource-based.
1:27:25
Didn't have much there except for the Deadwood folks.
1:27:29
There wasn't too many people that lived out there?
1:27:31
There were quite a few, but no, it was definitely rural.
1:27:34
That was rural.
1:27:34
It was rural and most of the folks made their living off
1:27:39
the land, one way or another.
1:27:41
Right.
1:27:43
Lowell was still in the hey-day of harvest.
1:27:51
So, the rural folks were still mostly resource-oriented.
1:27:57
They made their living off the land one way or another, but
1:28:02
were, all of 35 miles from Eugene.
1:28:07
So, there was
1:28:09
-- You were influenced by the same political forces that affect up here, also?
1:28:13
Yes.
1:28:15
Bly
1:28:17
was strictly resource-based.
1:28:20
I mean, the middle of nowhere.
1:28:27
You wouldn't find somebody from U of O in Bly.
1:28:32
I mean, it just wasn't, there weren't enough facilities there for them.
1:28:38
It was a "good-old boy" logging culture.
1:28:40
Right?
1:28:40
It was, it was.
1:28:42
Describe that.
1:28:44
You were there four years.
1:28:46
Yeah.
1:28:46
So, what was that like?
1:28:48
How did you feel about your relations to the local community?
1:28:55
I had good relations with the local community.
1:28:57
I got involved in the community to some extent.
1:29:02
At that point, Weyerhaeuser had a mill that probably had
1:29:04
400 people working in it.
1:29:09
I think there's always been a tension between the logging and mill folks and
1:29:15
the Forest Service for various reasons.
1:29:23
You know, people learn this is the way you do it, and sometimes particular
1:29:29
loggers are really slow to accept the fact that you shouldn't turn
1:29:35
your ground into a parking lot.
1:29:39
You know, so there's the appropriate management actions potentially.
1:29:45
So, that became, the Forest Service is wrong and we're right, or the logger is
1:29:50
wrong and the Forest Service is right.
1:29:55
But it wasn't.
1:29:58
I was friends with one of the mill managers.
1:30:01
It wasn't, those folks who thought about it, weren't a problem.
1:30:14
So, Bly was primarily resource-based.
1:30:21
Where is that community now?
1:30:23
The mill closed.
1:30:24
That's what I thought.
1:30:26
So, there's nothing left there, right?
1:30:28
There's nothing there.
1:30:28
There's a gas station, store.
1:30:31
A lot of empty houses.
1:30:33
Have they been all flattened or
1:30:36
-- ? The older ones were flattened because they didn't have any foundation,
1:30:39
so it was easier to flatten them.
1:30:41
There's still folks living there.
1:30:45
I expect it's become
1:30:49
more retirement.
1:30:51
I'm not positive, but I expect.
1:30:54
It's still very much a
1:31:02
ranching community to some extent.
1:31:06
But that all happened after you left.
1:31:08
Yeah.
1:31:08
The mill closed, what, in the '80s, '90s?
1:31:18
Probably early '90s.
1:31:21
Basically,
1:31:26
Weyerhaeuser, they were into full-yield forestry, had by that
1:31:31
time decided they didn't want to fuss with managing pine forests.
1:31:37
So, they were going through and liquidating their
1:31:44
merchantable holdings.
1:31:47
When they did that, they closed that mill down and sold off their land.
1:31:52
So,
1:32:01
they were mining and would harvest and regenerate.
1:32:05
And they did a great job of regeneration.
1:32:08
So, Weyerhaeuser was good about reforesting in a very
1:32:11
responsible, proactive manner?
1:32:13
Yeah.
1:32:14
They were even fertilizing some of that ground in the early '80s.
1:32:18
Surprised the heck out of me.
1:32:19
Now, contrast this with companies or entities that didn't do it the right way?
1:32:25
D.R. Johnson down in the Umpqua.
1:32:31
They just didn't care?
1:32:32
They didn't care.
1:32:37
By then, the forest, when I was down there, the Reforestation
1:32:40
Practices Act had been passed.
1:32:43
So, they had to reforest,
1:32:46
but they didn't have to control brush or make sure that they got it fixed.
1:32:51
So, they'd hire a hoe-dad crew to put a bunch of seedlings in
1:32:54
and walk away from it, right?
1:32:56
Yeah.
1:32:58
And it shows to this day.
1:33:02
But anyway, talking about the big variance between the responsible
1:33:06
reforestation and people that didn't care.
1:33:06
Yeah.
1:33:09
And of course, let's
1:33:11
-- But I think for the most part, the larger, and even a lot of the smaller landholders
1:33:20
are in it because they want to be in forestry, so they're responsible.
1:33:24
I think since probably the
1:33:28
'70s, when OSU really developed some of the recommendations for tree handling
1:33:35
and effective tree growing, that most of the organizations accepted that.
1:33:43
In terms of the method of replanting, how has that changed from the
1:33:46
'70s until now in terms of how you designed and implemented planting
1:33:49
in terms of slopes or spacing or
1:33:55
other considerations?
1:33:56
What's changed is spacing because of better understanding about tree
1:34:00
growth at various spaces and levels.
1:34:02
And the philosophy on whether you should plan on doing a
1:34:07
pre-commercial thinning or not.
1:34:10
And the relatively short rotations on the west side that the industrial forest uses.
1:34:18
So, spacing has changed based on better understanding of tree growth,
1:34:26
differences in merchantability.
1:34:33
But the actual tree planting hasn't changed using the same tools
1:34:37
because that's the best there is.
1:34:41
Well, the firefighters are still using Pulaski tools.
1:34:43
Yeah.
1:34:46
The same thing, yeah.
1:34:49
So, tell me a little about the Lowell District, same question,
1:34:51
continuing forward about the economy, the "local" cultures?
1:34:53
The economy of Lowell,
1:34:56
when I was there, timber was still big.
1:35:00
We did have in the
1:35:07
early '80s, there was a little bit of depression.
1:35:09
I got to Lowell about '85, and it was starting to ramp up again.
1:35:13
So there, a lot of folks were making their living either in the
1:35:19
forest or from the forest industry.
1:35:21
Now, where were the mills that those logs went to?
1:35:24
Eugene.
1:35:24
Did they go to Eugene?
1:35:25
Eugene, basically.
1:35:25
It was only up in the Oakridge and Rigdon Districts that went to Westfir
1:35:29
and those ones up there, right?
1:35:30
We would send some trees to Westfir or Oakridge.
1:35:35
But
1:35:38
let me think about that.
1:35:41
For us, it was probably split between Eugene and them.
1:35:44
Now, when you mean Eugene, you mean Springfield, also?
1:35:46
Yeah, the Eugene-Springfield area.
1:35:46
I mean, Rosboro and Weyerhaeuser and Seneca and other players.
1:35:48
Right?
1:35:48
Yes.
1:35:48
Yeah, the
1:35:52
Eugene-Springfield area.
1:35:56
So
1:35:56
-- Occasionally, some would go to Independence [near
1:36:00
Salem] , there was a mill there.
1:36:03
But not often from Lowell.
1:36:05
So, a lot of the folks out there were involved in the logging
1:36:08
industry, or agriculture?
1:36:08
Logging industry or agriculture.
1:36:10
Because you were lower down.
1:36:11
We were closer to the valley interfaces, correct?
1:36:13
Yeah.
1:36:22
The populace south, in the Lowell-Dexter area, pretty much supported us.
1:36:26
But you know, they were resource-oriented.
1:36:30
The Eugene continuum didn't for the most part.
1:36:36
There wasn't that much activism.
1:36:43
I held an open house at Lowell for our herbicide product,
1:36:47
and KEZI and I showed up.
1:36:50
But no activists?
1:36:51
No activists.
1:36:52
I mean, I was there, you know?
1:36:55
Were you on television?
1:36:56
I was.
1:36:58
[Laughs]
1:36:58
Speaking to an empty room?
1:36:59
Yeah,
1:37:02
KEZI.
1:37:03
I was impressed with the reporter.
1:37:06
They came up expecting to cover a controversy, and when there wasn't a
1:37:10
controversy, they changed it around and said, "Here's the Forest Service
1:37:13
asking you for your opinion, and you're not even giving it to them."
1:37:19
So, for us, it was a positive.
1:37:21
Right.
1:37:22
Yeah, but it's like I say, really impressed me.
1:37:24
You had your couple minutes of fame on the nightly news.
1:37:27
Exactly.
1:37:27
Yeah, yeah.
1:37:29
How about the North
1:37:32
Umpqua?
1:37:32
Okay, actually, it was Diamond Lake District.
1:37:34
Diamond, I mean.
1:37:34
Yeah, it's on the North Umpqua River.
1:37:36
At the Diamond Lake District, we're so far out that the SO [supervisor's
1:37:40
office] didn't come visit us very often.
1:37:42
You know, we're 60 miles out of town, which isn't much but
1:37:49
-- What about the local folks way out there in the economy?
1:37:52
Were you on the fringe of
1:37:56
--? We weren't even on the fringe.
1:37:58
We were in the middle of the forest.
1:37:59
The Toketee Falls [community] is the Forest Service and Pacific Power, because
1:38:05
they have a power project up there.
1:38:09
The nearest anything is Glide, which at that point had two mills, I think.
1:38:15
So that's where your logs went through, to Glide?
1:38:17
Glide was the primary.
1:38:19
Was there also one over on the other side, too, on the other side,
1:38:21
over by La Pine or any of those?
1:38:23
No, none of our logs went that way.
1:38:25
Okay.
1:38:26
The mills tend to focus on species.
1:38:32
So, the east side focused on ponderosa pine, which we had a little bit.
1:38:37
Because you were on that interface with the high forest.
1:38:39
Yeah, yeah.
1:38:42
The Roseburg mills focused on Douglas-fir.
1:38:47
But there was enough ponderosa pine in their area that there were mills
1:38:53
that also bought ponderosa pine.
1:38:55
So, all our stuff went west.
1:38:59
They paid more money.
1:39:03
So now, going forward to this, the eras are different.
1:39:06
You're in, you're down there in the '80s to the '90s when all the Forest
1:39:11
Wars and everything happened, and the politics completely changed.
1:39:14
Yes.
1:39:15
How did that change for that particular area?
1:39:22
What changed was the funding.
1:39:26
And
1:39:30
the effects of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:39:34
But the Northwest Forest Plan was, I'd say less impactful to
1:39:39
the Umpqua than to other forests.
1:39:43
Particularly less impactful to the Diamond Lake District because it was
1:39:47
high elevation, so it wasn't owl habitat.
1:39:51
So, you weren't even affected by the Dwyer injunction then?
1:39:54
We were, because it had shut down everything.
1:39:56
Oh, okay.
1:39:57
It shut down everything.
1:39:58
Yeah, the Dwyer injunction shut down everything.
1:40:01
We were impacted by it to a much lesser extent.
1:40:06
Now, how did the local communities and the local people react to it?
1:40:10
Oh, well, local being Roseburg, really, Glide and Roseburg.
1:40:13
Well, that's what, when I'm saying that, I'm extending the valley
1:40:15
continuum, exactly [Umpqua River Valley - Roseburg, Glide, etc.]
1:40:15
Right, yes.
1:40:18
Negatively.
1:40:19
I mean, it was their livelihood and a
1:40:25
good share of the mills only bought Forest Service timber, you know, so it impacted.
1:40:31
It shut them down?
1:40:32
It shut them down, yeah.
1:40:35
Not completely, because at that point folks always had lots
1:40:38
of logs in their mill yard.
1:40:41
So, it wasn't an immediate shutdown.
1:40:44
And they were able to adapt it.
1:40:47
It reduced
1:40:52
ships at the log mills.
1:40:54
I don't think any of the log mills actually shut down at that point.
1:40:59
You mean, they went from three shifts to two shifts or
1:41:02
--? Sort of; three shifts to one shift.
1:41:03
Or one shift, okay.
1:41:04
Yeah, yeah.
1:41:05
Right.
1:41:06
And
1:41:11
you as a silviculturist, you saw all these changes.
1:41:16
Old growth, all the different sizes of trees, how did that change what you did,
1:41:21
as for whatever reasons, less old growth was being logged, and they started going
1:41:29
into different sizes of trees, and even as the wood products industry itself
1:41:37
evolved, meaning not just boards of wood, but whatever we use the forest products
1:41:43
for; pressed boards, paper, etc., etc.?
1:41:50
What it meant for us for the most part was more stuff was merchantable.
1:41:55
It increased our merchantable
1:42:00
offering because that lower diameter stuff could be sold, merchantable,
1:42:07
you know, they would actually buy it.
1:42:11
And for the most part,
1:42:19
the industry didn't get into the oriented-strand board
1:42:22
and that sort of thing.
1:42:26
Probably, the Roseburg and Eugene area, pulp was the much
1:42:30
bigger thing, so chips for pulp.
1:42:36
Some particle board, but it wasn't a big part.
1:42:39
How many of the mills were actually fitted so they could adapt versus
1:42:44
-- ? The
1:42:48
larger mills adapted as it became apparent that they needed to
1:42:52
-- And the smaller ones didn't have the ability to adapt?
1:42:56
I think more, they didn't have the foresight to adapt.
1:42:59
Okay.
1:43:04
The worst example I saw was Lakeview Lumber.
1:43:09
And this was out beyond Bly, I mean, way out there.
1:43:15
Lakeview Lumber, until about five years ago, did not have a
1:43:23
small log processing facility.
1:43:26
They ran everything through an ancient head rig that was designed
1:43:30
for 70-inch diameter material.
1:43:34
They couldn't make, they could not make money on 12-inch stuff.
1:43:42
Some of the mills in Roseburg and Eugene area won't take
1:43:47
anything over about 14 inches.
1:43:50
Because they've reacted and changed and adapted?
1:43:53
They've reacted, changed and adapted.
1:43:55
Right.
1:43:58
There's
1:44:03
Freres Lumber up in Mill City,
1:44:08
has
1:44:11
two different peeler mills.
1:44:14
Their large one takes stuff up to 12-inch diameter.
1:44:18
Their small one, they want to average 8-inch diameter.
1:44:21
Average 8-inch diameter.
1:44:22
So, small stuff?
1:44:23
Small stuff.
1:44:26
You know, they reacted.
1:44:29
They saw a niche, took it, ran with it and they're, near as I
1:44:36
can tell, they're profitable.
1:44:39
Their stuff isn't old.
1:44:41
Some of the ironies about this is, some of the laminated products that are coming
1:44:47
out based in smaller wood adaptations, are actually stronger, infinitely stronger.
1:44:52
Yeah, the LVL, laminated-veneer lumber, those sorts of things.
1:44:58
Right, correct.
1:44:59
Yeah.
1:45:02
Interesting.
1:45:03
I have a brother who's a builder down in California.
1:45:07
Years ago, he went to using LVL for their beams, you know, for large
1:45:17
stuff, because it was cheaper.
1:45:22
Because of the lack of availability of large trees to
1:45:25
get larger, you know, 4 x 12's or
1:45:30
that sort of thing from trees.
1:45:32
Now, originally, it was economically better to cut the old growth, right?
1:45:37
Oh, well.
1:45:39
Or was it really?
1:45:39
Or was that because it was just the practice?
1:45:41
No, it was in the '50s,
1:45:47
old growth was going for $3 a thousand.
1:45:50
If it had many knots, there wasn't any value in it.
1:45:53
Even though it was solid, you
1:45:57
almost couldn't sell anything that wasn't clear.
1:46:01
So, they were responding to market.
1:46:05
The markets wouldn't take things with knots.
1:46:07
They had to cut old growth to get knot-free stuff.
1:46:12
You know, if it has knots in it, it was the junk that the mill workers
1:46:17
took home to build their own houses.
1:46:19
Or to make cool tables or whatever?
1:46:21
Yeah.
1:46:22
I see, got you.
1:46:23
[Break in audio]
1:46:28
Okay, we are coming back from a break at lunch, and we will try to
1:46:31
pick things up where we left off.
1:46:34
I believe we were talking about the North Umpqua last time.
1:46:39
And you had discussed about the local community and the land-use
1:46:44
dynamics that changed over the course of your time there?
1:46:47
Yeah.
1:46:47
You might want to segue from that, and even if you rehash
1:46:50
some of the material before.
1:46:51
So, in the Umpqua
1:46:58
there wasn't a big change because it wasn't affected as much as other forests
1:47:04
with the Northwest Forest Plan that had more matrix [classification of
1:47:07
lands in plan] . And it also had the support of the local populace, Roseburg,
1:47:13
Douglas County, for continued harvest.
1:47:16
And that's it.
1:47:16
Yeah,
1:47:27
you probably ought to go on from there.
1:47:29
No, that's okay, we've pretty much finished that track.
1:47:32
I just wanted to be complete.
1:47:33
Now, after the North Umpqua, where did you go?
1:47:38
I went to Lowell from...
1:47:41
So, you went back to Lowell?
1:47:43
No, wait a minute.
1:47:43
You're reversed.
1:47:44
Let me think of what I did there.
1:47:46
So, from the Umpqua National Forest Diamond Lake District, I went to the
1:47:52
McKenzie District on the Willamette, as district silviculturist and
1:47:59
also in charge of sale planning and
1:48:05
something else in there, but silviculture and sale planning primarily.
1:48:08
What was the nature of the beast when you got here for that particular job?
1:48:12
You'd been to all these different places, doing more or less silviculture?
1:48:14
So, the Northwest Forest Plan was in full tilt.
1:48:18
The
1:48:20
district had gone to primarily commercial thinnings for their harvest.
1:48:30
Any clear-cuts that were being done had been old sales that were still active.
1:48:35
So, the new sales were commercial thinnings.
1:48:40
Had some exposure with the H.J. Andrews on that because it was on the district.
1:48:48
But there wasn't a lot of activity going on in terms of timber sales by this time?
1:48:54
It had dropped significantly, yes.
1:48:57
By that time, it was probably 10 percent or so of former harvest.
1:49:03
Now, we haven't talked about the Northwest Forest Plan yet,
1:49:06
but I'll use that as a segue.
1:49:08
You were at North Umpqua during the whole Forest Wars, the Dwyer injunction, and
1:49:14
then planning for and implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:49:17
That four or five-year period of time, that happened when
1:49:20
you were at North Umpqua?
1:49:21
Yes.
1:49:21
What do you remember about that dialogue when you were down there,
1:49:25
the involvement or the effect that you saw in the local communities
1:49:29
with the Forest Service, your impact, and how you saw that going forward?
1:49:34
Okay, because of the situation in the Roseburg, Douglas County area, for
1:49:43
whatever reason, the Northwest Forest Plan didn't hit the Umpqua National Forest
1:49:48
as hard as other national forests, or at least the North Umpqua Drainage, the
1:49:53
North Umpqua and Diamond Lake Districts.
1:49:56
So,
1:49:59
the drop in harvest wasn't as drastic.
1:50:03
So, it was a big impact to the communities, but it wasn't as
1:50:09
devastating as some other areas.
1:50:12
Right, because a lot of it wasn't northern spotted owl territory, correct?
1:50:15
Right, right, yeah.
1:50:17
It only mainly affected the more downstream portions?
1:50:20
Yeah, the lower elevations.
1:50:21
Lower than where you were stationed at, correct?
1:50:25
Yeah, most of the Diamond Lake District was above 3,500-foot elevation.
1:50:30
What do you remember about the stresses upon, the dialogues within the Forest
1:50:35
Service, during that period of time?
1:50:41
There was definitely a dichotomy of what we ought to be doing.
1:50:45
So, particularly, the "old timber beasts," as I'd say, thought that
1:50:50
it was ridiculous to be managing for anything other than timber.
1:50:55
Many other folks, particularly, wildlife biologists, were saying,
1:50:59
"It's the law, we got to....." So, there was some tension there.
1:51:04
Do you think that the traditional forest people, especially the supervisors,
1:51:10
maybe even the older guard, who were even older, were resentful?
1:51:15
They were resentful, yeah.
1:51:16
They didn't see a need for managing for anything other than timber production.
1:51:22
And so you might even say that they resented the new, as one of my previous
1:51:27
interviewees called them, the "ologists?"
1:51:29
Yes, yes.
1:51:31
Because they represented science, introspection and slowing down,
1:51:36
and making much more difficult the traditional methods of managing lands?
1:51:43
Yeah, they resented it because it was changing what they felt, how they felt,
1:51:48
we ought to manage the forest lands.
1:51:51
How did you feel about it personally?
1:51:54
And you were a silviculturist, you weren't a senior manager, but
1:51:57
you were caught up in all this and
1:51:59
-- ? I
1:52:03
had always had a broader view of forest management in terms of managing the
1:52:08
forest, rather than managing a tree farm.
1:52:11
So,
1:52:13
they just pieced it out, it's the law of the land, we need to comply.
1:52:18
We could have done different things than we did, but we
1:52:23
didn't.
1:52:24
We need to comply and manage for that suite of species, those
1:52:30
old-growth-dependent species besides the northern spotted owl.
1:52:36
Now, the marbled murrelet, that's a less-known species, but
1:52:44
isn't that more on the West Slope, and even in the Coast Range more?
1:52:46
It's Coast Range.
1:52:46
Almost all Coast Range.
1:52:47
Yeah, it's Coast Range.
1:52:50
I believe it's no more than 50 miles from the Coast that they'll nest.
1:52:54
So, for us, it's all Coast Range.
1:52:57
They don't get into the Cascades.
1:53:00
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if some bird got off-course and ended up in
1:53:06
the Cascades, but occasionally, being a duck hunter, we occasionally get
1:53:15
water fowl species that are found in Eurasia
1:53:20
on the West Coast here, because they went the wrong way, turned left at
1:53:23
the Bering Strait instead of right.
1:53:25
So, you know, folks, birds get off-track sometimes.
1:53:31
All species do.
1:53:32
Yes.
1:53:33
Even humans.
1:53:34
Yes.
1:53:34
Anyway, so, what
1:53:40
do you think are the positives and what do you think are the negatives
1:53:41
of the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:53:46
The positives are that we recognized and tried to do something about
1:53:50
managing for a suite of species.
1:53:54
The negatives are that
1:53:58
we didn't adequately address or consider a management option
1:54:05
that didn't put set-asides.
1:54:08
You know, we now have this piece of set-aside for timber, this
1:54:11
piece of set-aside for owls, and never the twain shall intermix.
1:54:16
I think that we could do that and be effective at it.
1:54:21
In other words, you would be saying, adaptive management, but in a more
1:54:26
flexible way, where one region wasn't all of one thing, versus
1:54:29
-- Yeah, yeah.
1:54:33
The other factor is that, having talked enough with some of those scientists
1:54:38
that were involved in putting together the Northwest Forest Plan, some
1:54:43
things got changed between what the scientists proposed and what came out.
1:54:49
For example?
1:54:53
I may not be able to get the specifics, but,
1:55:01
oh yes, I can.
1:55:02
Streamside buffers.
1:55:08
The management, the science team, didn't intend the streamside buffers
1:55:12
to be no management, no harvest.
1:55:18
When they came out, it was a no harvest.
1:55:23
So, it was a more flexible designation?
1:55:26
Designation.
1:55:26
It was a more flexible destination.
1:55:27
And it came out rigid?
1:55:28
Yeah.
1:55:30
Interesting.
1:55:31
There were also little weird things that came out of it,
1:55:41
like one of the forest ecologists in the Forest Service managed to get
1:55:54
hemlock dwarf mistletoe put on the list of species that needed to be looked at.
1:56:03
It is clearly not a species that was endangered or even rare.
1:56:10
There were some parts of it that just didn't make sense.
1:56:23
I think some scientists saw an opportunity to stick the Forest Service with research
1:56:29
responsibilities, and managed to do it.
1:56:33
Okay.
1:56:34
So, basically, future funding-cycle opportunities?
1:56:37
Yes, yes.
1:56:40
But, so it's a mixed bag?
1:56:42
It's a mixed bag.
1:56:44
And twenty years out, I mean, I think a 20-year report will be
1:56:47
coming out this year or next year?
1:56:49
Yeah.
1:56:50
The 15-year's been out for a while.
1:56:52
What to you anticipate that report to say?
1:56:58
It will probably say they did a great job.
1:57:02
Did not quite meet the timber targets, big surprise.
1:57:06
Are the timber targets anywhere near to being met in some forests?
1:57:14
Not in Northwest Forest Plan forests.
1:57:19
The Northwest Forest Plan assumes that we would be able to harvest
1:57:25
older timber in the matrix, and that has not been the case.
1:57:29
I was severely disappointed with the environmental groups and Fish and
1:57:37
Wildlife Service that signed off on that plan, and then, as soon as they signed
1:57:41
off, forgot that they agreed to it, and fought us on management of matrix land.
1:57:49
So, we're fast-forwarding now to '98, and you're here in the McKenzie District by
1:57:55
the Andrews, you're where you live now.
1:58:02
Describe your job duties, experiences, as silviculturist
1:58:07
in 1998, for the next few years?
1:58:09
Okay.
1:58:09
So, I was the silviculturist and was responsible for sale planning, or sale
1:58:16
prep, putting up the timber sales.
1:58:21
Our focus was on commercial thinning of stands,
1:58:28
getting away from the clear-cuts which were the
1:58:33
kind of the lightning rods for the environmental communities.
1:58:39
We still had to do some survey-and-manage surveys, but while they were expensive,
1:58:46
they weren't onerous in terms of stopping us from what we wanted to do.
1:58:52
Partly, we selected stands we thought would be less likely to be an issue.
1:59:00
And what about salvage logging and other forms of, well, even
1:59:04
that can be controversial?
1:59:06
Oh, it's been controversial, continues to be.
1:59:10
I came in at the end of a
1:59:19
combination drought and spruce budworm infestation that left lots of
1:59:26
dead true firs up towards the pass.
1:59:33
The district had tried to do something to harvest some of
1:59:36
those, but with the delays in,
1:59:42
delivery of delays by environmental groups and so on, by the time they
1:59:46
got to it, there wasn't any value left, you know, they couldn't sell it.
1:59:50
Because they were too rotten and they'd been out exposed for too long?
1:59:55
Yeah, true firs start rotting about the day after they die.
1:59:58
So, they're, they don't have many defense mechanisms against decay bacteria.
2:00:07
So, within a couple years they're going to be to a point
2:00:10
where there is no value to them.
2:00:14
Now, going back to a different time and era, but the same
2:00:18
interest group, if you will.
2:00:21
You first got into forestry when the tail end of the French
2:00:26
Pete controversy was happening?
2:00:29
Yes.
2:00:30
And that's something that really goes back to the late '50s and early '60s, kind of a
2:00:35
pre-environmental age preservation debate?
2:00:39
Yes.
2:00:42
What did you know about that issue when you were younger, and how do you see
2:00:47
that going forward as like an early litmus test for environmental activism
2:00:53
in this region, and how things are today?
2:00:59
Oh, boy, I think it is a continuum.
2:01:02
Gifford Pinchot and John Muir were battling each other,
2:01:07
preservation versus use.
2:01:13
I was aware of French Pete, it was occurring while I was in college.
2:01:16
And that was college, Oregon State, so it was a local issue.
2:01:20
You heard about it?
2:01:20
Yeah.
2:01:26
I think it's a broader problem with society that we want what
2:01:32
we want, and we don't want to
2:01:36
compromise or cooperate with each other.
2:01:42
So, nearest I can tell, the environmental community wants to protect everything.
2:01:49
They're not really going to be happy until they either get shut down or public
2:01:57
opinion turns enough against them, or they actually get to preserve everything.
2:02:05
What do you think of the environmental community, of which you probably agree
2:02:10
with a lot of the general precepts?
2:02:13
I probably do agree with a lot of it, yeah.
2:02:15
But why do you feel that the political dynamic has become what it is, and
2:02:23
why people like you, who are more old-school conservationists with a
2:02:29
preservationist bent, is that probably a fair assessment, are so unhappy with what
2:02:35
you have seen happen in that activist community and overall political dynamic?
2:02:41
Yeah.
2:02:41
I suspect it has a lot to do with the move from rural to urban.
2:02:49
Folks really don't understand where the lumber in their
2:02:53
house came from, or don't care.
2:02:57
You know, like milk comes from the grocery store.
2:03:02
And when you separate those goods you're using from its location, from
2:03:13
its source, then you can get some really weird ideas about what you
2:03:19
ought to be doing with the source.
2:03:23
That, you know, folks complain about what the forest community does to ecosystems,
2:03:31
and I bet there isn't one Fender's Blue, whatever it is, Blue Fender Butterfly, in
2:03:40
Eugene.
2:03:42
You know, Eugene has wiped out an entire ecosystem, really.
2:03:48
Replaced it with
2:03:51
concrete and exotic species ecosystem.
2:03:57
But,
2:03:59
you know, it's a lack of understanding about consequences, lack of understanding
2:04:07
about where we get the resources we use, and the lack of understanding what
2:04:12
we have personally been responsible for in terms of altering ecosystems.
2:04:20
Do you fear the environmental movement is not sustainable because of its
2:04:26
intolerance and unwillingness to compromise in important situations?
2:04:33
I'm not sure, because I suspect there's always going to be somebody will
2:04:36
listen to the "woe is me, the world is ending tomorrow," and fund it.
2:04:48
So, you're here on the McKenzie River, you're doing this.
2:04:51
Let's go back further.
2:04:55
When was the first time you came out to McKenzie River Valley?
2:04:59
Oh, probably when I was working at Lowell for meetings, silviculture meetings.
2:05:03
And what was your impression of this place, aesthetically and also
2:05:07
as a forester, as a professional?
2:05:09
I'd say, it was similar to the Lowell District, so more of the same.
2:05:17
It was nice
2:05:19
valley, pretty valley.
2:05:22
I love forests, well, what's not to like?
2:05:25
Right.
2:05:27
Now, go more into your experiences when you returned, well, not
2:05:31
returned, but when you came here in the late '90s, early 2000's?
2:05:33
So, I'd say, pretty much
2:05:41
business as usual for that period of time.
2:05:46
We were planning sales, working around the Northwest Forest Plan, survey and manage.
2:05:53
Doing thinning, so that we didn't hit the clear-cut button.
2:06:01
Doing what we could and I thought doing a good job.
2:06:05
Didn't have a lot of direct interaction with the Andrews.
2:06:11
I mean, because they were here, I had interaction with them,
2:06:15
but I didn't have at that point
2:06:22
a direct involvement.
2:06:24
At that time, Blue River and McKenzie were separate districts.
2:06:29
And there was a silviculturist on the Blue River District that had
2:06:36
responsibility for Forest Service silviculture input to the Andrews.
2:06:41
Okay, who was that?
2:06:43
Jim Mayo.
2:06:46
Now, the people that really started interacting with the Andrews goes
2:06:51
back quite a while, with Steve Eubanks and Lynn Burditt, particularly.
2:06:54
Yeah,
2:06:58
well, even
2:06:58
-- Steve, very interested in the science and the interchange, Lynn Burditt, kind
2:07:02
of the Northwest Forest Plan situation.
2:07:05
Yes.
2:07:05
More social interaction.
2:07:08
Right.
2:07:09
And so,
2:07:14
you still didn't interact with them very much?
2:07:16
No.
2:07:16
Even when you came back here?
2:07:17
No, because the Blue River District had most of that responsibility.
2:07:23
So, we interacted, but not on a regular basis.
2:07:26
But what did you know of the science that emanated from the Andrews
2:07:32
that had changed how you looked?
2:07:36
Oh, sure.
2:07:36
You already talked about the spotted owl, obviously, and Eric
2:07:39
Forsman did his work at the Andrews, but also all over the Northwest.
2:07:43
So, Franklin did his, a lot of his
2:07:51
plant association stuff, centered around the Andrews.
2:07:55
At that point, there was even some information centered around the
2:08:00
Andrews in terms of downed wood, the importance of downed wood,
2:08:04
some of those sorts of things.
2:08:07
I was very aware of a lot of the work coming out of the Andrews.
2:08:11
And being
2:08:14
a voracious reader of forest literature, I read a lot of that stuff.
2:08:18
So, you saw some of these of what are now famous studies?
2:08:22
Yes.
2:08:22
And ecosystem science.
2:08:25
You saw them coming through the pike, as you were able to read the literature.
2:08:30
And I suppose even through the Forest Service pipeline,
2:08:33
gets new information, right?
2:08:34
Yeah, yeah.
2:08:36
And what do you remember the reputation of the Andrews was when you first
2:08:42
really started hearing what they were doing, and I'm talking about
2:08:44
in terms of the "old guard" we were talking about, "the resistance," and
2:08:50
the "new-fangled, difficult" ideas?
2:08:52
Well, it's interesting because I think the Andrews has always had a good
2:08:57
reputation for doing good science.
2:09:00
It's just the conclusions that came out of it weren't always accepted by,
2:09:07
even folks like Kerrick [Mike] that really supported the Andrews,
2:09:12
didn't necessarily like what came out of it.
2:09:16
Because they knew that it would make their jobs more difficult, or they literally
2:09:19
just didn't agree with the conclusions?
2:09:22
I think some of both.
2:09:23
I think some of both.
2:09:25
Right.
2:09:26
And what were some of those things that you discovered were
2:09:30
coming out of the Andrews and when do you remember hearing them?
2:09:34
And there's obviously, there's Jerry Franklin, there's Eric Forsman,
2:09:36
there's all these different things?
2:09:37
Yeah, I guess, I don't have a timeline of when I started hearing.
2:09:43
Just generalize.
2:09:44
It doesn't have to be time-specific.
2:09:45
So, I would say probably
2:09:49
in the '80s, I started hearing about some of the
2:09:55
old-growth issues, downed wood issues,
2:10:01
different requirements for different species.
2:10:08
And, you know,
2:10:11
as the information became available, then my knowledge base became broader.
2:10:18
Did you hear about Mark Harmon's 200-year log decomp study?
2:10:24
I did.
2:10:25
That was probably, I'm trying to think.
2:10:29
I bet I didn't hear about that until I moved here to the McKenzie District.
2:10:33
So that was after-the-fact,
2:10:39
it had been going for a while, right?
2:10:44
Yeah.
2:10:44
Oh, not that long, I don't think, but it had been going for a while.
2:10:44
Now, how would you describe the community in this area, and I guess you could extend
2:10:49
the range of not just your district, but your knowledge of how this place was
2:10:54
at that time, and what you knew about it, how it had evolved in the last 10
2:10:59
years, 15 years, before you got here?
2:11:01
So, by the time I moved here, it had changed significantly, from
2:11:10
a resource-based economy to a recreation-retirement economy, or
2:11:26
communities, pretty much up and down the McKenzie Valley.
2:11:32
When you get west of
2:11:39
Leaburg, then it's less so because you're close enough you
2:11:42
can commute easily into town.
2:11:44
Right.
2:11:46
But still it's those folks, while there may be working class,
2:11:51
they aren't resource-oriented.
2:11:55
So, the community, if you will, in the McKenzie Valley shifted from a
2:12:00
resource-based to a non-resource based.
2:12:05
How do you feel that the locals that were still here felt about
2:12:10
the Forest Service by this time?
2:12:12
Oh, they hated us because the resource-oriented folks put the
2:12:19
blame on the Forest Service.
2:12:22
You know, it was our fault that we weren't tagging anymore.
2:12:26
And that's just the lack of a broader perspective on their part.
2:12:35
They couldn't tie the broader aspects of society's change to what was
2:12:42
happening in the Forest Service.
2:12:44
So, there were some contentious interactions during these times
2:12:48
with you, and maybe, supervisors?
2:12:51
Typically not.
2:12:55
The logging community would complain within themselves.
2:12:59
We would tend to hear about it from the leaders of that
2:13:02
community, which tended to be
2:13:11
more moderate in how they dealt with us.
2:13:15
You know, typically, the loggers wouldn't come up to us and start screaming at us.
2:13:21
They'd scream at their bosses who would come send their
2:13:23
representatives to you guys?
2:13:25
Yeah.
2:13:27
I mean, we knew what was going on, but we didn't have a lot of direct interaction.
2:13:35
Partly, that's because we didn't frequent the same bars.
2:13:45
So, how did you try to adapt being here to the totally new matrix of
2:13:52
what multiple-use and sustainability meant, however you would define that?
2:13:58
So, for me, other than the fact they chose a different model of how to manage than I
2:14:06
would have, it was part of the continuum for me of continuing to increase our
2:14:12
knowledge of managing a forest for the wide variety of values that a forest can
2:14:18
provide, including the plants, non-tree species, plants other than trees and
2:14:25
animals, and maintaining them as part of
2:14:30
the ecosystem, if you will.
2:14:32
So, for me, it was just a continuum change.
2:14:36
It wasn't a black-and-white change.
2:14:41
Now, a slightly different topic.
2:14:44
How do you see these changing management paradigms and political dynamics and
2:14:49
how they have affected fire management?
2:14:54
Surprisingly, fire management has been on its own trajectory.
2:15:09
The teaching of
2:15:11
the public and ourselves about fire management and what we might do to lessen
2:15:22
stand-replacing wildfires where they didn't used to occur,
2:15:27
has been an education for us.
2:15:30
On the west side, while I think that there's lots of areas where we could
2:15:36
reduce stocking and reduce the chance of a stand-replacing fire, it's less clear on
2:15:45
the west side than it is on the east side.
2:15:48
East side folks are still willing to let us do things and so on, for the most part.
2:15:55
Because they know how hot a fire can burn if it's not thinned.
2:15:58
Correct?
2:15:58
Yeah.
2:15:59
Because of the dryness?
2:16:00
Yeah, and when the people in Sisters, two or three times in a five-year
2:16:04
period, have to think about leaving home, that kind of gets their attention,
2:16:11
and Bend's close enough that they see what's happening in Sisters.
2:16:15
So, there's support there for that because it's very evident that if you thin it, you
2:16:24
can reduce the change of stand-replacing.
2:16:27
If you don't thin it, it's going to go up in smoke if it catches fire.
2:16:31
West side, that isn't as clear.
2:16:34
What were you taught in forestry school and during your learning
2:16:39
curves that you described, all your self-education, about fire management?
2:16:43
I mean, obviously, the Forest Service foundational philosophy following the
2:16:50
1910 "blow-up" [multiple million acre fires in northern Rockies] was to
2:16:51
suppress all fires by nightfall [next morning] , or whatever the phase was?
2:16:54
Yeah.
2:16:55
And how did your philosophy evolve as a silviculturist, as you
2:16:58
also understood these dynamics?
2:17:04
So, even early in my career when I went to Bly, I had
2:17:15
some of the knowledge that low-intensity fires were a
2:17:19
natural part of the pine system.
2:17:23
We didn't go there for a variety of reasons, but at least we were starting
2:17:28
to think about that as an issue.
2:17:31
West side, much less so.
2:17:35
Because it's very unclear.
2:17:36
I think the west side has greater ranges of natural fire history.
2:17:43
Because of the moisture?
2:17:44
Because of moisture.
2:17:45
Right.
2:17:46
And you know, the asbestos forest burns when it gets dry.
2:17:52
So, it's less clear on the west side whether those actions will actually
2:17:59
reduce stand-replacing fires.
2:18:02
Very clear on the east side.
2:18:03
Now, it's been quite a while since there's been a catastrophic, huge fire
2:18:07
on the west slope of the Cascades.
2:18:09
When was the last one?
2:18:11
Well, it depends on how big you call it.
2:18:15
I mean, that's a matter of whether you live in the neighborhood, I guess.
2:18:20
The Diamond Lake District had a 15,000-acre fire that came within
2:18:24
three miles of the ranger station.
2:18:28
You know, when it gets that close, it gets kind of squeaky.
2:18:36
But probably on the west side of the Cascades, I don't remember anything
2:18:42
much larger than 15,000-20,000 acres, but we've had several of them.
2:18:47
Now, the B&B up by the pass [Santiam] was
2:18:49
--? That's an east side fire, and it was 90,000 [acres]
2:18:51
. That's what I thought.
2:18:52
Yeah, and it had popped over [Cascade crest] , but really, it was
2:18:55
popping over from an east side fire.
2:18:59
Right, and the really historic, huge burns in Oregon history, the
2:19:05
Oxbow and the Tillamook burns, plural, were in the Coast Range?
2:19:09
Yeah.
2:19:10
So, just
2:19:12
--? We had the same sort of thing in the Cascades, but we just don't, we
2:19:20
haven't advertised the history of that.
2:19:27
Some of the more recent studies have shown that even in the Andrews and
2:19:35
surrounding area, there can be return intervals of 70 years and return
2:19:41
levels of two-three hundred years, within a relatively short time.
2:19:45
Do you see a fuel load problem in this general vicinity?
2:19:49
Let's just say
2:19:50
-- Well, yes and no.
2:19:51
The McKenzie River Valley, you know, the greater watershed here?
2:19:56
At 60 years, we can have 40,000-50,000 board-feet to the acre.
2:20:00
That's a huge fuel load.
2:20:02
Mostly live, but it's a huge fuel load.
2:20:06
If it gets dry enough, it will burn.
2:20:11
I think what we need to remember is that about 1850,
2:20:17
some million or two million acres of the Coast Range burned.
2:20:21
Now, there wasn't anybody out there trying to put it out, so who knows if we could
2:20:27
have kept it to merely a million acres.
2:20:28
But, the Tillamook [s] , I think, was close to 500,000 with the multiple burns,
2:20:35
and we were trying to put that out.
2:20:37
So, it really has to do with a combination of fuel loads and weather conditions.
2:20:48
Now, you left the McKenzie River District for a while before
2:20:52
returning again, am I correct?
2:20:54
Yes.
2:20:54
Tell me about where you went after that?
2:20:57
From the McKenzie District, I went to the Fremont-Winema.
2:21:00
I first went to the Winema at Chiloquin.
2:21:03
I was there about a year, and then moved over to the Fremont to be the forest
2:21:09
silviculturist for the combined forest.
2:21:13
Total of about five years there, a year in Chiloquin, and four years in Lakeview.
2:21:18
And you were dealing with pines again mostly?
2:21:21
Mostly pines, some true firs.
2:21:23
We were dealing with a little bit of reducing the extent of
2:21:33
juniper because it had really invaded into some of the historic grass shrublands.
2:21:41
Now, is that because of ranching?
2:21:46
Well, both ranching and wildlife.
2:21:50
The junipers pretty much take over a site and reduce the available
2:21:57
forest to zippo if it's very thick.
2:22:01
Now, the political debates down there when you were there were more
2:22:05
connected to the water from the Klamath River and that whole dynamic?
2:22:10
Oh, yes.
2:22:10
Yes.
2:22:12
So, politics didn't really enter too much into what you did out in the forest?
2:22:17
It didn't.
2:22:21
Lakeview had what was called the "Sustained Yield Unit," which meant that,
2:22:26
I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 250,000 acres of the Fremont,
2:22:37
was set aside to provide logs to mills
2:22:45
within the unit, which meant Lakeview and
2:22:49
Paisley.
2:22:50
Right.
2:22:53
That had expired, but the community including the environmental
2:22:59
community, realized that
2:23:04
if something like that didn't remain in place, the last mill likely
2:23:08
would close, which would be a severe blow to the economy of Lake County.
2:23:15
So, they got together and convinced the Forest Service to maintain that
2:23:21
in a slightly different form, but basically, the same sort of thing
2:23:26
that the logs from there would be dedicated to the Lakeview mill.
2:23:36
How many people work at that mill, approximately?
2:23:38
Oh, less than a hundred.
2:23:40
Oh, but that's for a town the size of Lakeview, that's
2:23:43
--? It's huge.
2:23:43
It's huge.
2:23:43
That's a gigantic chunk of the demographic and the economy.
2:23:47
And well-paying jobs, relatively.
2:23:53
The issues there had to deal with
2:24:00
harvesting thinning stands to make them both fire resilient and provide
2:24:13
logs to the mill.
2:24:16
One of the issues there, was that
2:24:20
up until
2:24:24
2008 or something like that,
2:24:28
they ran everything through their head rig that was designed for a 70-inch log.
2:24:35
They could not make money on anything less than 12-inch diameter.
2:24:39
So, they really didn't want half of the volume that we
2:24:43
could actually provide to them.
2:24:46
And this is the place that you described, I think off the record,
2:24:50
that was very slow in adapting.
2:24:53
Right?
2:24:53
Very slow in adapting, yes.
2:24:55
You know, Lakeview Mill is
2:24:59
part of Collins Pine, which is a bigger, not huge, but a bigger organization.
2:25:05
And they couldn't get it together to put in a small log-processing facility.
2:25:11
And how much would that cost, probably a million dollars?
2:25:13
A million dollars, maybe less.
2:25:16
Sawmills
2:25:18
are still relatively cheap to get into, for the value, for
2:25:24
the return you can get from
2:25:28
them.
2:25:30
When I was there,
2:25:34
there was, still is, a big thought process around biomass, utilization of biomass,
2:25:41
because there's lots of sub-merchantable stuff even for a small log mill.
2:25:47
One of the things I did when I was there was go through our timber
2:25:50
inventory to evaluate how much
2:25:57
volume we might have, you know, kind per-acre base, how much
2:26:03
tonnage of biomass we might have available to feed a biomass plant.
2:26:09
As part of that, I also analyzed what most folks would call merchantable
2:26:14
timber from 7 to 12 inches.
2:26:17
That's where I pointed out to the Forest Service and the mill, that the mill
2:26:24
was foregoing virtually half the total volume that we could supply, because
2:26:30
they just wouldn't harvest that stuff.
2:26:33
They'd refuse to harvest it.
2:26:35
Now, they finally adapted, though?
2:26:37
They finally adapted.
2:26:38
And I haven't been back to talk to folks enough to see how successful that was.
2:26:44
Would you say that's one of the reasons why many of these
2:26:46
smaller mills went under?
2:26:49
Yeah.
2:26:50
They just failed.
2:26:51
They refused or failed, or maybe they just didn't have the
2:26:55
liquidity to upgrade, shall we say?
2:26:58
Yeah, I think so.
2:27:03
I'd say probably most was due to short time spans, a short time horizon.
2:27:11
They couldn't see that they needed to put some money away
2:27:14
to upgrade their equipment.
2:27:17
They couldn't see the Forest Service wasn't going to provide them
2:27:21
everything, all the big logs that they wanted forever down the road.
2:27:25
And so, they couldn't or wouldn't adapt until it was too late.
2:27:30
I haven't talked about this, but how did international markets affect what you have
2:27:36
done in your career in the Forest Service?
2:27:40
Asia mainly, is what I'm talking about.
2:27:45
Yeah, it has indirectly at times raised the price, the price that
2:27:52
we could sell trees and timber for.
2:27:58
We've always had a prohibition against exporting logs from federal land as logs.
2:28:09
So, that never happened then?
2:28:13
No.
2:28:15
One exception, the Port Orford cedar.
2:28:17
That was one that they could export logs, but that was it was
2:28:21
kind of a specialty product that somebody got an exemption for.
2:28:25
Because I just remember hearing from wherever when I was younger,
2:28:29
"Part of the problem is they're shipping all the logs overseas."
2:28:34
To some extent that's true.
2:28:37
That would be private stands though, right?
2:28:38
Private stands, yes.
2:28:40
But because of the increased demand, and
2:28:48
I'd say limited supply, I mean, not limited, but limited.
2:28:51
You know, the folks are only going to cut so much a year, no matter what the price.
2:28:56
So, it would have?
2:28:56
So, it raised the price.
2:28:57
It would have affected, it would have raised the price.
2:28:59
Exactly.
2:29:00
Yeah, and it probably affected
2:29:05
the prices.
2:29:07
If a company was exporting logs, they could not buy
2:29:11
logs from the Forest Service.
2:29:14
So, what they call substitution.
2:29:18
So, they couldn't export private logs and cut Forest Service logs.
2:29:22
So, that did affect probably some mills in terms of how much timber they could get.
2:29:31
Now, there is theoretical science which is often called basic science,
2:29:34
and there is applied science.
2:29:36
You've alluded to some of these issues earlier.
2:29:39
How would you define these categories, and in regards to research sites, the
2:29:43
Andrews or other research in general, what responsibilities do you think
2:29:47
scientists have in applying their research towards something practical?
2:29:52
And inversely, what role do you think you see that basic science has,
2:29:57
independent of utilitarian end-goals?
2:30:03
Basic science has its place.
2:30:06
And a lot of what we know now as applied, we wouldn't know if somebody
2:30:12
hadn't been doing basic science.
2:30:23
It's very tough for a practitioner, even myself who does a lot of reading, to take
2:30:28
basic science and move it into a practical sense, other than in very rare instances.
2:30:36
But I still support some of that basic science because over the
2:30:39
years, I've seen how basic science
2:30:45
brings us some information that we then use to develop some
2:30:56
practical science, if you will, something that we can use in
2:31:00
terms of forest management.
2:31:05
Now, kind of putting the shoe on the other foot, what are the
2:31:09
responsibilities of the land manager, the technician, as they relate to
2:31:15
important scientific findings, even if they could result in difficult management
2:31:20
challenges and political problems?
2:31:24
I guess from my standpoint as a land manager, we need to pay
2:31:29
attention to what we learn.
2:31:33
I mean, science is where we're going to learn it, you know, one way or another.
2:31:37
We need to pay attention to it and react appropriately and make
2:31:41
the changes we need to make.
2:31:44
It's always difficult to make changes, so some folks do it easier than others.
2:31:49
You came back here for the very last stint of your career.
2:31:53
Is that correct?
2:31:54
Yes.
2:31:55
You came back from the Winema-Fremont stint down south, in what year?
2:32:08
It must have been, let me think,
2:32:13
2006?
2:32:15
Probably 2006.
2:32:15
And then you worked for how many years till you retired?
2:32:20
I retired the end of 2010.
2:32:22
And what were the last Forest Service years like, once again,
2:32:26
I assume, as a silviculturist?
2:32:28
The silviculturist for the forest [Willamette] , which of course, a
2:32:31
lot of it, once you hit forest level
2:32:34
-- So you where there for the whole Willamette National Forest?
2:32:39
Yeah, for the whole Willamette National Forest.
2:32:42
More administrative stuff.
2:32:45
I was lucky on the Fremont-Winema in that I got to do more hands-on stuff.
2:32:51
So, you were still out in the field?
2:32:53
I was still out in the field, more than I had any reason to expect to be.
2:32:58
So, the Willamette pretty much had silviculturists on all the districts.
2:33:04
Fremont-Winema didn't.
2:33:07
And they could handle their district stuff pretty well.
2:33:10
So, minor amounts of technical advice, that sorts of thing, but
2:33:15
more administrative budget stuff.
2:33:17
But also part of my job was being the silviculturist for the H.J. Andrews.
2:33:23
The silviculturist
2:33:25
for the Forest Service that
2:33:29
reviewed H.J. Andrews stuff, interacted with H.J. Andrews on silviculture from
2:33:35
the standpoint of the National Forest.
2:33:38
Right.
2:33:41
So, before we get into the Andrews because this it was later in your career
2:33:45
when you really interacted, but this is important to get to this point.
2:33:50
Give me an overview through the different districts from a
2:33:53
silviculturist's perspective in the Willamette; the Detroit, the
2:33:58
Sweet Home, the Lowell, others, and since they changed names over time.
2:34:02
You don't have to give me an exhaustive list.
2:34:03
Right.
2:34:04
But just kind of by zone, if you want to call it that.
2:34:06
The Lowell District
2:34:11
and consequently, the Cottage Grove District on the Umpqua, being pretty much
2:34:17
in the same drainage, were very much like the Coast Range in terms of productivity.
2:34:24
Low elevation, relatively.
2:34:28
So Cottage Grove and Lowell were very much like the Coast Range in terms of
2:34:33
productivity, relatively low elevation, relatively deep soils, plenty of moisture.
2:34:41
Not terrible, you know, pretty mild winters, so trees were growing year-round.
2:34:46
Part of the Sweet Home
2:34:53
area is like that.
2:34:55
You get higher up in elevation, you get colder winters, shorter growing seasons,
2:35:03
and consequently lower productivity.
2:35:05
The south end of the
2:35:08
Willamette is a little bit dryer, so a little bit less productivity,
2:35:14
but still nothing to complain about.
2:35:18
And obviously, you've got rocky ridges and so on that don't do real well.
2:35:24
And the high elevation into the sub-alpine and alpine zones.
2:35:30
And this area here is?
2:35:33
It's intermediate.
2:35:34
Very good productivity.
2:35:38
It's a pretty-long growing season, but
2:35:45
you know, probably below 2,500 feet,
2:35:49
you get freezing at night, but not heavy freezing.
2:35:53
So, trees
2:35:56
are producing carbohydrates year-round.
2:36:01
Now, those last four or five years were when you really
2:36:06
interacted with the H.J. Andrews?
2:36:07
Yes.
2:36:08
And by this time, the Andrews had evolved a lot from its early
2:36:12
days as an experimental forest without any infrastructure
2:36:17
except one road, at the start.
2:36:19
Right.
2:36:20
To the infamous "ghetto in the meadow," where the trailers where
2:36:26
the floors fell through sometimes, there were rodents and stuff, to
2:36:30
this modern, first-class facility.
2:36:32
And so you came here for your real active period when all those things
2:36:37
[modern facilities] were in place?
2:36:37
Yeah, yeah.
2:36:39
I had seen it early on when it was
2:36:43
-- Tell me about some of those first impressions before we fast-forward.
2:36:46
Okay?
2:36:47
Very fleeting, because they were just short and I saw the "ghetto in the
2:36:54
meadow" as we went out into the woods.
2:36:58
But I would characterize it as typical Forest Service trailers,
2:37:04
which are trailers that the Forest Service had gotten surplus from
2:37:10
the Army or housing or somebody.
2:37:17
And we got them because they were in poor shape to begin with.
2:37:23
So, you remember that?
2:37:25
I remember that.
2:37:25
And I wasn't around for the development.
2:37:28
And so when I came back
2:37:30
-- It was what it is now?
2:37:32
Yeah, yeah.
2:37:33
And so, just what do you remember, just describe any of your interactions,
2:37:38
however you want to describe it from the facilities that you saw,
2:37:42
the people who were in charge, how the forest was run, how the science
2:37:49
interacted with what you were doing, your liaison role, all of those things?
2:37:53
So, my liaison role had more to do with specifically looking at proposals
2:38:00
to see if we as the Forest Service could support those proposals.
2:38:06
And then,
2:38:10
some recommendations in terms of health of trees and that,
2:38:13
that's sort of an offshoot.
2:38:15
But
2:38:18
as a result of that, I attended a lot of H.J. Andrews meetings, LTER meetings,
2:38:26
to keep abreast of what they were planning.
2:38:29
It just made more sense to do that than to allow them to get down to a hard plan,
2:38:37
and then for us to say, "Well, maybe we ought to do something different." So,
2:38:41
I'd say it was a cooperative venture.
2:38:45
Now,
2:38:52
there haven't been any major, what they would call "treatments" in the old
2:38:58
days at the Andrews for a long time?
2:39:00
The uneven age management was the most recent extensive one.
2:39:07
And when was that?
2:39:09
So, that first occurred before I got here.
2:39:16
Early 2000's, probably.
2:39:18
So, there was a cut fairly recently?
2:39:20
Yeah.
2:39:21
But it was much smaller than the clear-cuts and the different things
2:39:26
that had been in the very early days?
2:39:26
Yeah, it was an attempt to look at how you might turn even-age management and
2:39:33
uneven-age management of the Andrews stands that had already been harvested
2:39:37
once, that had already been clear-cut.
2:39:39
Right.
2:39:41
And how do you remember that project turning out?
2:39:43
Well, it's still ongoing.
2:39:44
Or how it is turning out?
2:39:48
I think it's turning out okay.
2:39:50
I think we've learned since then that maybe that wasn't
2:39:55
the brightest thing to do.
2:39:56
How so?
2:39:57
I mean, it's fine.
2:39:58
How so?
2:40:04
We quickly went away from looking at uneven-age management on the west
2:40:09
side, and probably rightfully so.
2:40:13
I think, uneven-age management on the west side is fighting
2:40:18
against the course of nature.
2:40:21
West-side forests tend to come in, pretty much within, even
2:40:25
naturally, in a 10-year period.
2:40:28
We're trying to out-guess nature, in other words?
2:40:31
You're trying to work against nature.
2:40:33
Work against, yeah.
2:40:33
You're trying to work against nature's inclination on
2:40:36
these species and conditions.
2:40:41
Okay.
2:40:42
But I think we learned some stuff from it and could learn some more stuff from it.
2:40:47
One of the things that I think is important and we still haven't
2:40:49
figured out, is growth rate, particularly of Douglas-fir when
2:40:56
you have various size classes.
2:41:00
You know, what kind of growth reduction you would have with a Douglas-fir
2:41:04
seedling under partial over-storing.
2:41:07
Because of solar radiation and nutrient issues both?
2:41:10
Probably more with solar radiation, because we seem to have nutrient and
2:41:16
water sufficient to not be a big deal.
2:41:19
I think it's mostly solar for Douglas-fir and even hemlock and cedars.
2:41:28
In seeing the sophisticated and multi-varied research program and
2:41:36
very developed infrastructure, what programs, what studies, impressed
2:41:43
you or made an impression on
2:41:47
you, even to this day, because you're still in contact with the Andrews?
2:41:58
I think the stream-flow stuff, partly because that's a thing that
2:42:04
I don't know a whole lot about.
2:42:07
The air-flow stuff that,
2:42:11
oh, darn, what's her name
2:42:14
-- Barbara Bond?
2:42:15
Barbara Bond has been doing.
2:42:18
Very interesting.
2:42:20
We've always known that
2:42:26
climate,
2:42:28
weather in mountains, is very different than on flat land.
2:42:33
And I think we're learning just how much different it is,
2:42:39
in a quantitative fashion.
2:42:43
You know, as foresters, we always knew that south slopes are drier
2:42:49
and tougher to grow trees than on north slopes and that sort of thing.
2:42:53
Right.
2:42:54
But we didn't
2:42:58
have a base understanding of why, in terms of moisture and heat
2:43:04
load and those sorts of things.
2:43:06
But I think some of the stuff that she and others have been doing with climate and
2:43:11
mountains, has really been highlighting what those differences are and how much
2:43:17
different they are than on flat ground.
2:43:20
And micro-climatic variations?
2:43:22
Yes.
2:43:23
In airflows, temperatures, precipitation?
2:43:26
Yeah.
2:43:26
Much more complex than you would even intuitively think at first?
2:43:32
Yeah, much more complex over much shorter distance than
2:43:37
we'd intuitively think about.
2:43:40
Interesting, yeah.
2:43:41
What did you know about watershed dynamics when you started?
2:43:45
And of course, that's a big part of the whole history of the Andrews going
2:43:49
back to the clear-cuts and what happens to the watershed, but you mentioned
2:43:55
about stream-flow and things like that?
2:43:58
I think for foresters, stream flow and stream temperature, have always been
2:44:02
an issue, probably not one that we understood really well as foresters.
2:44:07
Right.
2:44:07
You know, hydrologists understood it better.
2:44:10
But it's been an issue for us, so I paid attention to it, but by no
2:44:16
means, have become an expert in it.
2:44:19
So, how has that changed from the beginning to now?
2:44:21
I mean, you're retired but I assume you're still paying attention?
2:44:25
I am still paying attention, yes.
2:44:28
Reading this and that, yes?
2:44:32
It was slow enough progression, I'm not sure that I could daylight it enough.
2:44:38
I've just changed an understanding of those processes.
2:44:43
But in what way?
2:44:45
How, what's your understanding like today, and what was it like at the start?
2:44:51
I think when I was a young forester, it was kind of black and white.
2:44:54
You open it up, it heats up, that's bad.
2:44:59
Close it, don't take the canopy off, and it stays cool, and that's good.
2:45:04
I think it's much more nuanced than that, and much more
2:45:12
site-dependent on the effects.
2:45:15
And partly because of
2:45:19
bedrock type, partly because of inflow from springs, partly temperature
2:45:26
that the water is, that, you know, as it gets into the stream.
2:45:32
Those sorts of things.
2:45:33
Now, in a related subject, the issue of debris, or dead wood,
2:45:38
or however people describe it.
2:45:41
Yeah.
2:45:42
In the old days, they would often either burn it off, slash piles, or
2:45:47
they'd scrape it off, or now that's
2:45:50
-- The fisheries folks had us pull it out of the streams.
2:45:53
Right.
2:45:53
Even early in my career.
2:45:55
And so that has completely changed?
2:45:58
That has completely changed, yes.
2:45:59
And the Andrews has been a central player in that?
2:46:03
Yes, they have.
2:46:03
Not just in the Northwest?
2:46:04
Right.
2:46:05
But how the world understands, decaying wood, carbon cycles, nutrients, etc.?
2:46:11
The importance of wood in streams.
2:46:13
Right.
2:46:14
Yeah, that's one place where the Andrews has been at the forefront.
2:46:18
And that, when did you realize that what they were doing before,
2:46:22
and what you were taught, was maybe not the best thing to do?
2:46:27
Probably pretty early in my career.
2:46:30
Really?
2:46:30
Yeah, I was one of those that wondered about the
2:46:37
intelligence of running a Cat [bulldozer] down a stream to clear the wood out.
2:46:41
[Laughs]
2:46:41
Yeah?
2:46:48
Yeah, it just didn't seem like the right thing to do to me.
2:46:52
Even after a clear-cutted swath, the whole area?
2:46:52
Yeah, it just didn't seem like the right thing to do to me.
2:46:52
And what was the rationale?
2:46:56
The rationale?
2:46:59
Because I learned from George Brown himself [former OSU-COF Dean] , the
2:47:02
rationale at that point was that you put too much biological oxygen
2:47:07
demand on the river, we were depleting oxygen in the streams.
2:47:11
So, you had to get all that organic matter out of it.
2:47:16
And you were impeding migratory species, migratory salmon.
2:47:23
Ah, yes.
2:47:25
As it turns, neither of those were true, but
2:47:28
-- That was the thinking, yes.
2:47:29
But that was the rationale at that point.
2:47:37
Now, you've already, any other important scientific discoveries at the Andrews
2:47:41
or in science in general, but especially the Andrews, that have directly affected
2:47:46
land management policies and practices?
2:47:51
Just beyond what we've already talked about.
2:47:55
I
2:48:02
think the Andrews was the first to use
2:48:07
three-drum yarders on their high-lead, their high-lead system, at that point.
2:48:12
[s] So, they were even at the forefront of
2:48:17
logging systems.
2:48:18
You're talking about the Wyssen high
2:48:20
-- Yeah.
2:48:23
And at that point, it was basically a three-drum, three drums and an
2:48:31
engine on a skid, and they were using spark trees for the tower.
2:48:39
Yeah.
2:48:43
So I don't forget, there's an interesting anecdote on the H.J. Andrews.
2:48:48
You probably know that the Andrews was created through a memorandum of
2:48:52
understanding between the research station [PNW] and the region.
2:48:58
Yes.
2:48:59
I think maybe the only one, only experimental forest
2:49:02
that got produced that way.
2:49:06
Early, they had Watersheds 1, 2, 3, etc. Watersheds, I think, 9, 10, and 11, were
2:49:16
actually outside of that agreement area.
2:49:20
And therefore, until I came along, they were part of the general forest.
2:49:30
And not
2:49:31
-- Was it because of a surveying mistake or
2:49:34
-- ? No.
2:49:34
Or just an oversight or
2:49:36
--? They just decided to stick these watersheds outside of the boundary.
2:49:40
Okay.
2:49:43
I mean, it was early, it was relatively early, I think the early
2:49:46
'60s, when, Watersheds 1, 2, 3 and so on, were being harvested, that
2:49:52
they did some work on 9, 10 and 11.
2:49:57
So, I looked it up and realized that, we've already dedicated it
2:50:02
to the Andrews, for all practical purposes, but we hadn't recognized it
2:50:12
administratively.
2:50:16
I started talking with folks and said, "Hey, folks, we really
2:50:21
ought to do something about this." Because as it stands now, as a
2:50:24
district ranger, you'd say, "We're going to do something in there."
2:50:28
Let's cut, right?
2:50:29
Let's cut, yeah.
2:50:30
Let's thin it, whatever.
2:50:31
Regardless of the science that's been going on?
2:50:33
Yeah.
2:50:34
Sayonara, right?
2:50:36
Sayonara.
2:50:37
So, after much discussion and talk, and as I recall, Fred wasn't real
2:50:43
keen on opening that can of worms.
2:50:47
Okay.
2:50:47
Because he was afraid that it might not
2:50:49
-- Fred, you mean, Fred Swanson?
2:50:49
Fred Swanson, yes.
2:50:51
I think he was afraid it wasn't going to go the right way.
2:50:56
I knew my folks on the forest and knew it was going to go the right way.
2:51:01
But, we finally ended up through a nonsignificant amendment to the
2:51:08
forest plan [Willamette National Forest] of putting those three
2:51:10
watersheds into a research designation.
2:51:15
We didn't add it to the Andrews as such.
2:51:17
So, it's still not technically?
2:51:19
It's not part of the Andrews, but it does have a research designation.
2:51:23
It is designated as essentially a research natural area, a contiguous area, right?
2:51:27
Well,
2:51:30
no.
2:51:31
It's not a research natural area, but it's in a planned designation
2:51:36
that holds it for research.
2:51:41
Okay.
2:51:42
So that the district rangers decide that who, he doesn't like whoever's running
2:51:48
the Andrews at the time, and decides to go in, it would be a little bit more
2:51:53
difficult for a ranger to come in and do something that would be contrary to
2:51:56
the interests of the research community.
2:52:01
Now, here's a related question.
2:52:04
I ask everybody this one.
2:52:06
OSU and U.S. Forest Service co-administration of the Andrews
2:52:10
can today be held up as a model for effective inter-institutional
2:52:14
management and science.
2:52:17
However, that hasn't always been the case.
2:52:19
There have been rougher patches.
2:52:22
Earlier generations of Forest Service managers, often didn't see
2:52:25
the wisdom of long-term science.
2:52:32
How would you characterize these dynamics during your late tenure and your exposure
2:52:38
to the Andrews' relations with the Forest [Willamette] and what do you know
2:52:41
about the past history in that area?
2:52:44
I don't know much about the past history.
2:52:47
I know, vaguely, that there were some periods when it was
2:52:51
less cooperative than others.
2:52:56
I think that during my tenure, the forest [Willamette] recognized and supported the
2:53:06
Andrews' mission, if you will.
2:53:10
I think the research community somewhat got that.
2:53:15
I think they still view it as their chunk of land that they ought to be
2:53:22
able to do whatever they want with.
2:53:25
But since it is still officially part of the Willamette National Forest,
2:53:30
the Willamette National Forest has to make sure that it's managed under
2:53:36
the broad concepts of the forest.
2:53:39
So, major plans at the Andrews still have to go through the Forest Service?
2:53:44
Yeah.
2:53:46
And within reason, they're going to be, in my tenure and probably still
2:53:52
currently, they'll be approved.
2:53:55
There might be some tweaks.
2:54:00
What do you think the partnership of land managers, the Forest Service,
2:54:04
has given the H.J.A. research community, turning it the other way?
2:54:13
Hopefully, it has given them a better appreciation of what land
2:54:17
managers go through and what types of information are helpful to us.
2:54:24
All right.
2:54:25
And I know that that's a mixed bag.
2:54:28
You know, people are just people.
2:54:31
Some aren't going to care what the land manager needs or wants.
2:54:36
Some are going to be more understanding.
2:54:39
They're just glad they are funded for their project and have a job.
2:54:43
Right?
2:54:43
Yeah, yeah.
2:54:44
Or they're just immersed in their science?
2:54:45
They're immersed in their science and they have a narrower view of the world.
2:54:52
Right.
2:54:55
As if none of us
2:55:01
- Now, regarding the OSU and the Forest Service researcher and the
2:55:07
Andrews, how many people really know they're up there or understand
2:55:12
who they are and what they do?
2:55:15
Outside of the research community, very few people.
2:55:20
I mean, does anybody?
2:55:21
I mean, you live here now.
2:55:23
Does anybody ever talk about those guys down there, or when
2:55:26
you were actively working?
2:55:29
The only folks that I know that talk about it have some tie with them, and that
2:55:34
they know somebody that works there, or
2:55:42
are, part of the Forest Service, or something.
2:55:45
But just the general public, for the most part, have no clue that they're there.
2:55:51
You don't think there's a continuum of people saying, "Well, the spotted
2:55:55
owl started up there, the "old-growth New Forestry" stuff started in part
2:56:01
up there, therefore, Northwest Forest Plan, our economy, is bad." Do you
2:56:09
believe there's very few people
2:56:11
-- ? Very few people put that together.
2:56:12
Okay.
2:56:13
Very few people put that together.
2:56:15
And why would that be?
2:56:18
People don't pay attention to a lot of stuff that isn't
2:56:23
very important to
2:56:31
them.
2:56:32
People in general, tend not to pay a whole lot of attention to a whole lot of things.
2:56:38
They have things that are important to them; they pay attention to them.
2:56:45
I doubt that there's more than three dozen people in
2:56:51
the McKenzie Valley total that aren't involved in with the
2:56:56
Forest Service or Andrews, that actually can put all that together.
2:57:01
They have no clue that the Andrews is the basis of a lot of this
2:57:07
watershed, large wood, old-growth
2:57:12
research.
2:57:13
To me, it's a natural connection to make, but I study this stuff.
2:57:19
And it's just a question.
2:57:23
I am truly curious about it because
2:57:28
we mentioned the urban-rural dynamics changing in this country.
2:57:32
And you mentioning that it was a big part, in your opinion, of why
2:57:36
the environmental community is often out-of-touch with natural resource use
2:57:42
in the old way, use of the land, you know, the working forest, so to speak.
2:57:47
Yeah.
2:57:47
But it also can be extended, I think, to the kind of cultural differences
2:57:54
and resentments toward whomever?
2:57:57
Right.
2:57:58
Toward the lost, the proverbial "them," the lost way of life.
2:58:03
And I've seen it in other places in the country where it's actually,
2:58:07
it's a very aggressive and angry form, like the Colorado Plateau
2:58:12
over all the wilderness area issues.
2:58:16
And, you know
2:58:16
-- Nevada.
2:58:17
They know where the BLM office is and they know where the Park Service offices
2:58:21
are, and they directly blame them, along with the environmental folks.
2:58:25
Oh, yeah.
2:58:27
I think some of those folks directly blame the Forest Service.
2:58:31
But they don't blame the pointy-head university types or researchers?
2:58:35
They don't even know, I think for the most part, they don't
2:58:38
even know that's the foundation of the Forest Service decisions.
2:58:42
Interesting.
2:58:43
Yeah.
2:58:45
I guess, I'm surprised that people wouldn't do that, but at the same time
2:58:51
-- Do you see it in the newspaper?
2:59:02
So, regarding the Forest Service now, do they still resent
2:59:06
the Forest Service up here?
2:59:07
I mean, you're retired, but you know all the people.
2:59:10
I think there's very few that resent the Forest Service.
2:59:13
Do you think it's just because people have moved on, people have
2:59:16
died, they've moved away, they've accepted with a resigned fatalism, or
2:59:23
--? Yeah.
2:59:24
Those who are in the timber industry that are still here are still employed.
2:59:29
Mostly, by private harvesting.
2:59:34
They've moved on and it's no big deal.
2:59:37
Those who lost their jobs have moved out, so they're no longer here to have that
2:59:44
antipathy towards the Forest Service.
2:59:46
The folks that are here are mostly displaced suburbanites.
2:59:52
So, they would rather see all the trees stay where they are?
2:59:54
Yes, yes.
2:59:55
So, where is active cutting going on anywhere in this general area, from where
3:00:01
we are at McKenzie Bridge right now?
3:00:03
So, private cutting just about three miles up North Bank Road.
3:00:15
You'd see private cutting down between here and Blue River, you know, the
3:00:24
slope, particularly south of the river.
3:00:31
I saw quite a few log trucks coming down the mountain when
3:00:34
I was coming up here, so?
3:00:37
Right now, I'm not sure where the Forest Service is harvesting,
3:00:50
probably up east of here up, probably up Foley Ridge Road, which is just
3:00:54
beyond the Forest Service office.
3:00:58
And then probably, some coming off further up
3:01:03
what we call the flat country, the country
3:01:09
south and east from Highway 126, between there and the wilderness boundary.
3:01:15
Okay, I know where that is.
3:01:16
What do you see as the value of the official science liaisons?
3:01:24
John Cissell was one in the past, but Cheryl Friesen is that person now.
3:01:29
What do you see is the value of that person in interfacing with
3:01:33
the Andrews, but also interfacing with the community about science?
3:01:44
I think there's real value to that.
3:01:47
It doesn't necessarily have to be a National Forest system person.
3:01:53
When I was young, the science community did that, you know,
3:01:59
deliberately reached out and gave
3:02:03
one-day or two or three-day seminars on the latest science.
3:02:10
That isn't happening anymore.
3:02:12
So, to some extent, I'm really glad that Cheryl is doing that.
3:02:17
And she has taken it pretty seriously.
3:02:21
You know, she actually tries to put on several sessions a year transferring
3:02:26
the latest science out to practitioners.
3:02:28
More
3:02:30
of that could be done, but, she can only do so much.
3:02:36
And really, she's the only one in this region doing that.
3:02:39
But she does it in a very approachable, friendly way.
3:02:43
She does, yeah.
3:02:45
Her personality is part of the reason, but I think that's just
3:02:48
how she decided to do the job.
3:02:50
She's got a passion for it.
3:02:51
Yes.
3:02:53
Right, she really loves that.
3:02:54
Yeah.
3:02:59
What do you think could be improved within the U.S. Forest Service?
3:03:19
So, I think one of the things that could be improved, it might be
3:03:23
impossible, but less reaction to
3:03:30
political changes, changes in administration, that create
3:03:34
changes in how we do business.
3:03:38
I also recognize that that's where we get our money, that's going to continue
3:03:43
to how we do business to some extent.
3:03:46
How do you think that the change in administrations, especially in
3:03:50
the increasingly hyper-partisan environment of Washington, is affecting
3:03:57
the mission of the Forest Service, which used to be more of a constant?
3:04:00
And I take it, that's what you were trying to address.
3:04:03
But how do you do that?
3:04:04
Partly, yeah.
3:04:05
Actually, I think that to some extent,
3:04:10
both parties have lost interest in management of our national forests.
3:04:17
And that may actually be a benefit to us, because the changes we see
3:04:23
from, you know, between Democrat and Republican administrations, is much
3:04:31
less than it was early in my career, which is to some extent a good thing
3:04:39
considering we don't have the level, the funding that would allow us to
3:04:45
do as much as we did in the past.
3:04:48
You know, if
3:04:52
the Forest Service was tied as much to party affiliation as it
3:05:00
used to be, we'd see wider swings.
3:05:04
Because if you assumed, and this is obviously a simplistic bifurcation of
3:05:09
partisan politics, but you would say, oh, we have a Republican president,
3:05:14
it's a "get-out-the-cut" U.S. Forest Service director, and that will
3:05:19
be the directives down the line.
3:05:21
And the other way, you would assume there would be a much more preservation
3:05:24
bent to the Democratic appointees, and the directors down the line, correct?
3:05:31
Right, yeah.
3:05:31
But you're seeing less of that?
3:05:33
Less of that.
3:05:34
Bush didn't fund us any better than Obama's been funding us.
3:05:39
And I think you're probably thinking back to the swing from the
3:05:44
Carter years to the Reagan years.
3:05:46
Yes.
3:05:46
That's when it was, James Watt was the Interior Secretary, for
3:05:50
example, not the Forest Service's boss, but a very polarizing figure?
3:05:54
A very polarizing figure.
3:05:56
Well, actually, we had a chief at that time who was getting the same
3:06:05
thing from the undersecretary of ag.
3:06:11
And it was really interesting, because that guy must have had more backbone than
3:06:18
anybody would ever give him credit for.
3:06:23
The undersecretary in the newspaper was often quoted that we were going
3:06:27
to increase the cut significantly.
3:06:32
We did not see that in official correspondence.
3:06:36
So, that meant?
3:06:39
The chief was saying, "I don't think so." [Laughs]
3:06:42
I understand.
3:06:43
Yeah,
3:06:49
and at that point, the chief was a career
3:06:57
employee who was not an appointee.
3:06:59
Which chief was
3:07:03
this?
3:07:03
Peterson [Max] was the chief.
3:07:08
It surprised me because the guy was an engineer, he wasn't a forester.
3:07:13
And was still willing to stonewall the administration.
3:07:18
At least, that's what it looked like.
3:07:22
Who knows what was happening in D.C., but the Undersecretary was saying we're
3:07:26
going to increase the cut significantly, the chief ain't telling us that.
3:07:32
Well, you can just call it passive resistance, I guess?
3:07:36
Yeah, yeah.
3:07:37
He'd just ignore it.
3:07:38
And since he was a career employee, he could get away with it.
3:07:42
He had tenure on a deep level.
3:07:44
Yeah.
3:07:45
Same question applied to the Willamette National Forest, what
3:07:48
you believe could be improved here?
3:07:59
There's lots of little things that could be improved, I expect.
3:08:03
I don't think anything big, because with the Northwest Forest
3:08:09
Plan, we wouldn't be able to
3:08:14
propose changing that paradigm of setting aside for one thing and then setting
3:08:22
something aside for another thing.
3:08:24
We couldn't even propose putting it all together and managing
3:08:29
it for a variety of resources.
3:08:33
And that's what I think the Forest Service could be successful.
3:08:41
Politically, it would never fly.
3:08:43
Right.
3:08:43
And the Willamette couldn't change it on its own because of the
3:08:51
"Declaration of Critical Habitat" by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
3:08:56
Would you say the Willamette is the most political of the forests in Oregon?
3:09:01
Oh, no.
3:09:02
I wouldn't say so.
3:09:03
No?
3:09:04
I mean in terms of activist focus, contentious dynamics?
3:09:09
Yes, I would say.
3:09:10
I didn't mean internally, in the Forest Service.
3:09:12
Yeah, I would say the Willamette because of its close relationship
3:09:17
with the Environmental Law Center [University of Oregon in Eugene] . Close
3:09:21
relationship and close proximity to Environmental Law Center makes it
3:09:27
get more than most other forests do.
3:09:30
Right.
3:09:33
You know, we're the home of Oregon Wild, we're the home of OFSLE and home of
3:09:41
the AFSEEE [Association of Forest Service Employees for
3:09:42
Environmental Ethics] , but anyway.
3:09:43
Is there anything that you think that the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest
3:09:48
could do better, or another thing they could study or study differently?
3:09:54
I kind of alluded to it earlier, but our knowledge of trees, of seedlings
3:10:01
grown under over-stories in the Douglas-fir region, is very limited.
3:10:07
We don't have the data in order to develop models that will
3:10:15
tell us how those trees develop.
3:10:18
And I think,
3:10:22
you know, there's been lots of this messy forest, messy clear-cut New Forestry
3:10:27
stuff, the stuff that Franklin and Johnson are working on, where if we truly want to
3:10:37
try to estimate what kind of product we'll get out of it, we need that information.
3:10:43
Right.
3:10:47
What are some lasting memories and relationships that have developed
3:10:51
about your time in the Forest Service, first of all, and then
3:10:55
we'll fast-forward to the Andrews.
3:10:57
But answer them in two parts.
3:10:59
Okay.
3:10:59
Tell me about your lasting memories, relationships, things that are
3:11:03
specific to your career that maybe you haven't mentioned yet?
3:11:07
Special things.
3:11:08
Okay, probably one of,
3:11:11
the Forest Service in general, is very
3:11:18
open to new members coming into a district or office of any kind.
3:11:25
Every time I've moved, I felt welcome.
3:11:30
You know, folks, "Oh, you're the new guy.
3:11:32
Let's show you around.
3:11:33
This is how we do things.
3:11:35
This is what you need to know.
3:11:38
Come on over for dinner tonight." Very open.
3:11:43
Family-type of atmosphere.
3:11:47
And from what I gather, that isn't necessarily true in even in the
3:11:50
rest of the forestry profession.
3:11:54
Why do you think that is?
3:11:55
The
3:11:59
esprit de corps, the feeling that we're all in it together.
3:12:05
The shadow of Gifford Pinchot and the culture that evolved
3:12:09
is very strong, isn't it?
3:12:11
Yes,
3:12:14
yes.
3:12:14
I think that's the real strength of the Forest Service and continues to be.
3:12:19
Yeah, it's interesting.
3:12:20
Even though Steven Mather, for instance, the founder of the Park Service,
3:12:27
and of course, Horace Albright, his lieutenant, and then the next director,
3:12:34
in many ways, were equally powerful personalities, but you
3:12:39
don't have quite the foundational
3:12:42
esprit de corps in the Park Service as you have in the Forest Service.
3:12:45
Okay.
3:12:45
I mean, it's there, but I sense you won't hear people saying, "Steven Mather rocks!"
3:12:54
They don't have a t-shirt like I do that says, "What would Gifford do?"
3:12:58
No, it's just not quite the same, although you're comparing two
3:13:03
strong institutions and figures.
3:13:05
Right, yeah.
3:13:05
Which just actually strengthens my point that I'm making that there's a
3:13:10
special thing about Gifford Pinchot.
3:13:12
Like I told you at lunch, the Forest Service multiple-use
3:13:15
paradigm is copied around the world.
3:13:19
In Peru, the
3:13:22
country of my wife, they are using management paradigms right out of the
3:13:26
Gifford Pinchot playbook, in Spanish.
3:13:29
Yeah, sustained-yield, multiple-use.
3:13:32
I mean, it's got different applications down there, different
3:13:34
ecosystems, different economies.
3:13:35
Sure, but similar thought-processes.
3:13:40
Very much so, the kind of the variables and the balancing
3:13:44
of all these different things.
3:13:46
It's exactly there.
3:13:48
It's very interesting to see.
3:13:53
What other memories, specific memories?
3:13:56
Oh, specific memories.
3:13:57
Things that you have, anecdotal stuff that you haven't brought up?
3:14:01
Fun stuff?
3:14:01
When I, why I remember it, I don't know, but when I was at Bly,
3:14:09
I got there in the winter, and I had to start planning the timber sale.
3:14:14
And this timber sale, I was looking at the photos and saw
3:14:17
this piece of a rail trestle.
3:14:21
It was from probably the '30s.
3:14:24
And so, I told myself, "Gosh, when the snow goes, that's the first
3:14:27
thing I'm going to go look at." The snow went, I went and looked
3:14:31
at it, and it was on the ground.
3:14:34
The photo had been taken the summer before.
3:14:37
Oh, it had dropped over the winter.
3:14:39
Wow, what a trip.
3:14:42
Yeah.
3:14:42
That's fascinating.
3:14:45
Wow.
3:14:48
Now, your experience with the Andrews is actually more recent, and I would
3:14:52
even guess, your social connections there, because I've seen you at
3:14:56
some of the events, continues today?
3:14:59
Yeah.
3:14:59
What memories do you have regarding the Andrews, interesting
3:15:02
interactions or personalities that
3:15:06
you haven't mentioned so far?
3:15:12
Nothing specifically sticks in my mind, but interactions with the directors.
3:15:17
[H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest Site Directors.]
3:15:18
Now,
3:15:21
did you know Art McKee?
3:15:23
I did, but not
3:15:25
-- Because he was here forever.
3:15:26
Yeah, he was here forever, and I knew who he was and had met
3:15:29
him, but hadn't worked with him.
3:15:31
Now, he's gone.
3:15:31
When I came the first time on this district,
3:15:38
oh, my name thing again, a woman,
3:15:46
was the director, had the job that Mark does now.
3:15:52
Kari O' Connell.
3:15:54
Kari, yeah.
3:15:55
Kari O'Connell, yeah.
3:15:57
Yeah.
3:16:01
So, just working with them.
3:16:04
As an aside, as the fire chief.
3:16:07
They like to get myself or somebody from the department to come up
3:16:11
and talk to the new summer folks about just general fire safety.
3:16:19
What's
3:16:21
your message to those summer interns, seasonals, what have you?
3:16:27
So, two basics.
3:16:30
If there's fire in the woods, if it's really small, you can try to
3:16:33
put it out, otherwise, call it in.
3:16:37
If it's fire in the building, get out and worry about it later.
3:16:42
I talk to them a little bit about how to use the fire extinguisher.
3:16:45
But say, unless it's smaller than a garbage can, get out.
3:16:52
Is there anything else that you'd like to say just kind of capping off the
3:16:55
interview that we haven't discussed yet?
3:17:03
Not that I can think of, at the moment.
3:17:05
Now,
3:17:07
if you were going to reflect on your whole career, you know, before your retirement,
3:17:15
how would you look back at your career?
3:17:20
I enjoyed it.
3:17:21
I enjoyed the challenges of trying to manage natural
3:17:26
systems in a semi-natural way.
3:17:30
Manage natural systems in a way that we could get them to
3:17:32
grow back to what they were.
3:17:37
And what would you like to do in the next 10 or 20 years?
3:17:41
Actually, I'm trying to be a forestry consultant and trying to focus on
3:17:50
small land owners who might need a little more hand-holding, than help.
3:17:59
Help small land owners to manage their lands in a better way.
3:18:06
Very good.
3:18:07
Well, I'd like to thank you for spending all this time on the record today.
3:18:11
And thank you, Norm.
3:18:12
And signing off.
3:18:14
Thanks.
3:18:15
All right.
