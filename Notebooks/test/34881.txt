00:01
Good morning, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State University
00:06
College of Forestry, also working with the U.S. Forest Service, here in the
00:10
home of Zane Smith, Springfield, Oregon.
00:13
It is May 29, 2014.
00:17
We are going to do an oral history interview today, which is part of
00:21
a broader history project centered on the H.J. Andrews Experimental
00:25
Forest, the LTER network, and ecological research in general.
00:30
But it's also going to include a lot of focus on land management,
00:33
forestry, etc., so we are going to be interviewing many different Forest
00:38
Service people, including Zane here today.
00:42
And how are you doing today, Zane?
00:43
Very good.
00:44
Thank you, Sam.
00:45
I want to thank you for taking time to meet us.
00:47
And this hopefully will be an enjoyable exercise as we go through
00:51
the past and reflect on things.
00:53
I like to start the same with everybody.
00:57
Where were you born and raised?
00:58
And beyond that, just give me a biographical sketch of your past.
01:03
Sure.
01:05
Well, I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1933.
01:11
And to a Forest Service family.
01:15
Shortly after that, we moved to Drake, Arizona, where dad was a ranger
01:22
on the Prescott National Forest.
01:26
I was there until about first grade.
01:32
And then we moved to Harris, New Mexico, where dad was the ranger
01:36
on the Cibola National Forest on the Sandia District there.
01:43
I started school at Tijeras in a one-room school; one teacher,
01:48
eight grades, about 12 students, mostly Mexican-American villagers.
01:56
And stayed there throughout that period till about the fourth grade, when
02:06
Dad was drafted, of all things.
02:09
He tried to enlist.
02:10
And he was a ranger and probably could have got a deferment, but he
02:17
finally was drafted and I went to live with my grandparents, also a Forest
02:21
Service family, while they were gone.
02:25
My mother, Elsie, and my father, Zane, actually went
02:32
to Camp Abbott, which is now Sun River, and then on up to Fort
02:36
Lewis where he served out his time.
02:39
And so, then at that point
02:43
- And which war was that?
02:43
That was World War II.
02:45
World War II,
02:50
okay.
02:51
Yeah, this was about 1943.
02:51
Okay.
02:51
He ended up in the Army, the Army [Corps of] Engineers.
02:57
So, from that point, we got our family back together and
03:03
went back to Albuquerque.
03:04
I went to school in Albuquerque, junior high and high school, and
03:11
graduated from high school in 1951.
03:15
About
03:19
that time, my folks moved to Montana, Great Falls, Montana, where Dad
03:25
was the forest supervisor of the Lewis and Clark National Forest.
03:28
I stayed and finished a year at the University of New Mexico, and
03:33
worked in Arizona on the Sitgreaves National Forest for the summer, then
03:39
transferred to Missoula, Montana, and graduated eventually in forestry
03:47
from the University of Montana.
03:56
Now, maybe thinking of specific places and experiences, what was your childhood
04:03
like, especially in relationship to the natural world, whether it be through
04:07
your family, the business, shall we say, of forestry and professional foresters,
04:13
camping trips, Boy Scouts, anything like that that got you "out there,"
04:18
and maybe made an impression on you?
04:19
Yeah.
04:20
My growing up was in a Forest Service family,
04:26
with the exception of high school, that meant I was raised in the country.
04:31
Pretty much a loner.
04:33
I walked to grade school about a mile-and-a-half to
04:37
this one-room school house.
04:40
Spent all of my time roaming the mountains around there.
04:45
Actually, I lived the first part of my life in elevations over 7,500 feet.
04:52
Now, where exactly was that, close to the Sangre de Cristo's?
04:56
Well, no, it was the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque, and it was the
05:01
Prescott National Forest in Arizona.
05:05
Okay, right.
05:05
So, this was all high country and pretty isolated.
05:09
Didn't really have many playmates, if any.
05:14
And I was pretty much independent.
05:20
I wandered the mountains by myself.
05:23
My mom had a police whistle, and she would ring that, if she wanted
05:28
me to, well, find out where I was.
05:30
And we had certain signals that, when I was supposed to
05:33
come home, and this and that.
05:34
We were around livestock a lot.
05:37
We always had horses.
05:40
In those days, the ranger [U.S. Forest Service] bought his own horses.
05:44
And we had always a milk cow and raised pigs, beef now and then,
05:52
and chickens and lots of chores.
05:56
So, that my job was splitting kindling and doing chores like that.
06:04
Any particular place or an experience that really impacted you?
06:12
Growing up, I think the experience there at the Tijeras Ranger Station
06:18
was probably the most pronounced.
06:20
That's where I really began to realize I wanted to be a Forest Service ranger.
06:26
And I spent a lot of time with my dad.
06:29
I started skiing when I was five years old, because Dad had a ski area, La
06:34
Madera at that time, in the Sandias.
06:37
Every weekend, I was up with him riding in the back of a Forest Service pickup
06:42
with his sheepskin coat on, and skiing.
06:47
He got me started without riding the rope tow.
06:52
I climbed for a year or so, and then skied down.
06:55
And then he finally put me on the rope tow.
06:58
Of course, that was long before Angel Fire or Taos or some other
07:01
more sophisticated resorts in northern New Mexico were even built.
07:05
Correct?
07:05
That's correct.
07:06
I think La Madera probably was one of the first ones.
07:09
It was at the Sandia Crest.
07:10
And it's about 10,000 feet, and pretty good snow.
07:16
Although my experience in Arizona says that the snow can be a little bit
07:22
inconsistent in both Arizona and New Mexico, except when you get up north
07:27
in the Sangre de Cristos, I believe.
07:29
Well, Arizona has big snow in Flagstaff and that part of the country, and
07:35
there's nothing wrong with the snow in New Mexico from the Manzano and Sandia
07:41
Mountains on north into 14,000-foot peaks in northern New Mexico.
07:48
Snow was never really a problem, at least in that period of time.
07:56
What kind of lessons did you learn from your father in terms of him
08:01
teaching you or you watching him be a professional Forest Service person?
08:08
Well, I, of course, observed all the activities.
08:13
There wasn't large crews in those days; the ranger, assistant ranger,
08:17
and then the temporary people.
08:18
So,
08:21
I observed him, particularly in dealing with permits for wood,
08:27
wood cutting, grazing permits,
08:32
fighting fire, dealing with the recreation activities, being with him
08:39
a lot around horses, this and that.
08:43
But he was a typical father of those days, I would say.
08:47
My mother was a little bit closer to me, and with me more.
08:52
She was generous in letting me roam around.
08:56
Dad did try to get me involved in certain activities that he was involved in.
09:03
He would take me with him.
09:05
In those days, the Forest Service families could ride in the Forest Service
09:08
trucks and that was not a problem.
09:10
It's a problem today, isn't it?
09:11
It's a problem today.
09:12
Yes.
09:13
And the same thing happened with my grandfather.
09:17
He was assistant forest supervisor of the Coronado [National Forest] in Tucson.
09:22
I spent summers with them down there and he took me a lot of places.
09:27
Dad was a stickler on chores.
09:34
They gave me a BB gun when I was very young and I learned a
09:38
lot about; I got a "Ph.D." in gun-handling, safety and so forth.
09:43
I remember once having pointed a gun at something I didn't intend to shoot,
09:47
and he took the gun away from me.
09:49
I was without it for quite a while.
09:52
In those days, it was a lot different than today in terms of kids growing
09:58
up and understanding the outdoors, and hunting and that sort of thing.
10:04
Since your family goes back so far with the Forest Service in
10:08
that part of the country, did they happen to meet or know Aldo Leopold?
10:14
Not that I know of.
10:15
My granddad started, he was in the West working for the [U.S.] Biological Survey
10:20
as a government hunter and trapper.
10:22
And he joined the Forest Service responding to the yellow recruitment
10:27
sign that talked about requirements for a ranger, of riding and roping
10:32
and packing a horse, and you know, good health and strength and so forth.
10:39
At the end, it says, "Invalids need not apply." He applied and was
10:45
assigned in 1917 to the Mayhill Ranger District on the Lincoln National Forest
10:54
outside of Alamogordo [New Mexico] . So, that's kind of how all that started.
10:58
I'm just going back to Leopold's famous writings that were based
11:03
in the Gila National Forest, I believe, on the New Mexico side.
11:09
Right.
11:09
My granddad was a ranger in three places on the Gila National Forest.
11:13
One place was, as he described it,
11:19
99 miles from a box of crackers.
11:21
My grandmother described it as 100 miles from the nearest loaf of bread.
11:26
And it was all horses.
11:27
Dad grew up on horses and was home-schooled until he went to
11:32
high school, where they farmed him out at Hot Springs, New Mexico,
11:36
now called Truth or Consequences.
11:38
Now, you grew up late enough where your family had automobiles or trucks, right?
11:43
Yes, yes.
11:44
Although you probably rode horses a lot, too, right?
11:46
Some.
11:47
Usually just hiked.
11:49
Okay.
11:51
So,
11:53
what kind of lessons do you remember them passing down, or you kind of through
11:59
osmosis getting from how they viewed the land, natural resources, conservation,
12:06
preservation, all these things that you would learn more about later in your life?
12:12
With my granddad and dad, there were pretty astute to fire.
12:19
They were some of the few people in the Forest Service who realized
12:23
that use of fire was important.
12:25
In fact, the regional forester in New Mexico and Arizona told my granddad
12:31
one time, Garvin, "If you don't get this silly notion out of your head,
12:35
you'll never be a forest supervisor." Because he was an advocate of using
12:39
fire, not like we do today where they just let it burn, but to use fire as
12:44
a means of retaining the ecosystem.
12:48
And this was in the days before logging, which were kind of a substitute
12:52
for density control and so forth.
12:56
So,
12:59
my granddad knew Zane Grey, worked with Zane Grey quite a bit, and I have lot of
13:04
correspondence between the two of them.
13:06
Is that where your name, or the two names, came from?
13:08
Yeah, my dad was named after Zane Grey, and my
13:16
granddad was raised in Kentucky, but went to dental school with Zane Grey, and
13:20
they both quit and went different places.
13:24
Then my folks named me Zane Grey Smith, Jr. And I went by the name of Grey, all
13:31
through my time at home because Mom and Dad didn't want me to be called "Junior"
13:36
or "Sonny" or some other nickname.
13:39
So, I've had two names for a long time.
13:42
I can always tell the generation that calls me Grey versus
13:46
the one that calls me Zane.
13:49
So, I must ask you, have you read Riders of the Purple Sage and some of
13:53
the other famous novels by Zane Grey?
13:56
Yeah, in fact, I've read a lot of them.
13:59
And I've got, I think it's about 23 first-edition books that were
14:04
given to my grandparents from Zane Grey, and they're in our library
14:10
and are a part of our family.
14:10
Well, you're really fortunate because, he [Zane Grey the author] had several
14:14
places, but one of his cabins by the Mogollon Rim burnt to the ground during
14:18
the Tonto Fire, I think they called it, or one of the big fires there by Payson
14:23
below the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
14:25
Yeah.
14:26
So, his whole library in that thing was burned down.
14:30
Yeah, it was unfortunate.
14:33
Zane Grey used my grandfather as a guide in the Mogollon/Tonto Rim
14:38
[both names used] country, when he was a government trapper/hunter.
14:42
But
14:45
that's unfortunate that that burned down.
14:47
Yeah, but that's a fascinating connection.
14:50
We all have stories to tell.
14:55
Now, how would you describe the ecosystem in New Mexico and the
15:02
management at that time, and the condition of the forest and the range?
15:08
I think the ecosystem was in pretty-good shape with some exceptions,
15:16
particularly in the area of grazing.
15:19
And I know my dad was very proud of the fact that he was able to restore
15:24
a lot of the grazing areas that he was responsible for on his districts.
15:30
There was not very much logging.
15:33
There's some, you know, pre-use wood by homesteaders and local people.
15:41
But nothing in the way of large timber operations.
15:47
Mainly, grazing, recreation and that sort of thing.
15:51
I think the thing was custodianship and stewardship.
15:56
It was the primary thing.
15:58
It was not until the '50s that we really got into production
16:02
of products and so forth.
16:05
Well, I would anticipate that a lot of the work for your grandfather,
16:08
and even your father, had to do with surveying homesteads, for instance,
16:14
and water rights and things like that, because the Homestead Act was actually
16:18
used more often in many parts of this country in the early 20th Century.
16:22
I think there was some of that.
16:24
I don't recall that as being a major thing.
16:25
Okay.
16:26
I think it was more stewardship and custodianship of the land and the
16:32
vegetation and wildlife, and so forth.
16:34
So, you moved to Montana in
16:39
-? 1952.
16:41
Okay.
16:44
Dad was the forest supervisor of Lewis and Clark [NF] at that time.
16:48
I was looking for a forestry school.
16:51
I went one year to the University of New Mexico, and pretty much took
16:56
an engineering curriculum, which prepared me for moving into forestry.
17:02
And I enrolled at the University of Montana and I graduated there.
17:08
Describe that experience in terms of the curriculum, the program of study,
17:14
what you learned, and any particular mentor or book or intellectual hero,
17:21
or person that you met at that early formative stage in your career, that made
17:26
an especially strong impression on you?
17:29
Well, graduating in 1955, I went through a transition of old-timers.
17:37
Al Spalding,
17:40
well, there's two or three others, Doc Waters,
17:45
Faye Clark, Mel Morrison, old-timers that were really back from an era when
17:52
there was primarily custodianship, and just moving into the area of production.
18:02
My major was forest management, which was the primary one.
18:11
I think the only fault I would give the University of Montana and all forestry
18:17
schools, was they were too technical.
18:21
Not that you don't need technical learning, but you need to have
18:25
an opportunity to broaden out a bit into the social studies so
18:33
that you can deal with people.
18:34
Because rangers and the Forest Service people, they don't just
18:40
deal with ecosystems and trees and fire, they have to deal with
18:44
people, and the whole social system.
18:49
I think that that could have been improved.
18:52
And the other thing that happened is that the Society of American Forester's
19:00
accreditation program was so full, you didn't have time to do anything else.
19:05
Fortunately, I joined the ROTC Air Force and that broadened me a little bit.
19:12
But it took me, later years with graduate school in Cornell, to really
19:18
get myself tuned into the entire
19:23
educational needs I was required to have to do my job.
19:28
So, you went and you worked for a while, or did you go immediately
19:32
into a graduate program?
19:34
No, I went to Cornell at mid-career.
19:37
I had been a ranger and I'd been a Job Corps Center Director, and several
19:44
other things, and I was back in Washington, D.C. working on a detail
19:49
to Vice President Humphrey's office for a period of time when he was in
19:56
charge of the Youth Opportunity program.
20:00
I had three cities assigned to me, Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, Missouri,
20:07
and East St. Louis, Illinois, to represent in that program.
20:14
After that, I went to Cornell.
20:19
Tell me about Cornell?
20:21
Cornell, I was what they call a NIPA, a National Institute
20:25
of Public Affairs fellow.
20:27
The Forest Service sent me there, the Department of
20:32
Agriculture elected me to be sent.
20:35
And we pretty much designed our own curriculum.
20:41
We were assigned to the Public Administration School at Cornell.
20:47
I took a lot of economics, social studies, things that I
20:56
didn't get in forestry school.
21:00
And it was an immense help.
21:03
And what was the master's degree, what was it called, or what was it in?
21:08
It was the National Institute of Public Affairs, as a fellow.
21:12
Okay.
21:13
So, now you can say you're an Ivy-leaguer, right?
21:16
I guess so.
21:17
Cornell is an interesting school because it's both a state and private school.
21:23
And they used to have a forestry school there, but I didn't take
21:25
anything to do with botany or forestry.
21:28
I took everything that was politics and that sort of thing.
21:33
How would you compare Montana to New Mexico?
21:38
The geography, the culture, the ecosystems, just the whole dynamic?
21:43
It's surprisingly more similar than you might think.
21:47
Because New Mexico, the lowest place in New Mexico is 3,300 feet.
21:54
That's the elevation of Missoula, Montana.
21:57
The highest place is over 14,000 feet.
22:03
That makes up the difference of latitude.
22:07
New Mexico is into the Rocky Mountain chain, as well, and that's what goes
22:12
clear up to Glacier [National Park] . So, there's a lot of similarity.
22:17
Montana is, from a production standpoint in forestry, much more productive.
22:24
But it's very similar country in terms of recreation and
22:29
scenery and that sort of thing.
22:32
Both Montana and New Mexico have a lot of grazing lands, range lands, a lot
22:37
of forest, a lot of high mountains.
22:41
Culturally, it's somewhat different because there's a large Mexican-American
22:46
population in New Mexico, where you don't have that [in Montana] , you
22:50
have more Native Americans up there.
22:53
A lot of Native Americans in New Mexico as well, but I think
22:57
that's a little bit different.
22:59
Yeah, the Latino influence is much stronger in New Mexico.
23:02
Yeah, especially, now.
23:04
[Break in audio]
23:11
So,
23:16
tell me about the beginning of your career after Montana.
23:20
You graduated with a degree in forest management?
23:23
I did.
23:23
And tell me about your first postings.
23:26
Take us through those first several years or postings.
23:29
Yeah.
23:29
I had worked on the Coeur d'Alene National Forest for two
23:33
or three summers during school.
23:36
That's in Idaho.
23:37
In Idaho, right.
23:39
When I graduated, I took the Civil Service exam.
23:44
And I got two offers, one in California in fire, and the other
23:47
one in Oregon in forest management.
23:52
I took the one in Oregon, and went to with my bride Betty, we headed from
24:00
Missoula, Montana, to Union Creek, Oregon.
24:03
And I was on the Union Creek District, which is just outside
24:07
of Crater Lake on the west side.
24:10
Huge timber.
24:11
So, is that the Umpqua or the Rogue?
24:13
[National Forests]
24:13
That's the Rogue, the Rogue River.
24:24
I served there until I was commissioned at graduation into the Air Force.
24:25
And I served there until I was called into the Air Force and went to
24:29
Texas, went through pilot training, and became a pilot instructor.
24:33
But then I came back to the Rogue River and was assigned to the Butte Falls
24:38
District, which is still in the Cascades.
24:44
Worked typically in timber management and fire, and stayed there, and then, I
24:52
also was in charge of the Rogue River's fire replanting for all the districts.
24:59
In about 1958 or '59, I was transferred to the Malheur National Forest in John
25:09
Day [Oregon] , where I became assistant to the timber staff there under a veteran
25:17
timber management person.
25:19
I was there for 13 months, and then sent to Klamath Falls on the then
25:28
newly-created Winema National Forest on the Klamath [Indian] Reservation.
25:35
When I was there, I was assistant ranger there for the Klamath District, and I
25:42
sort of had overall responsibilities for everything just like a ranger
25:46
would, only I was the assistant.
25:50
We were there five months, and then I was transferred with a promotion to Okanagan,
25:56
Washington, where I replaced Don Caron, who got in trouble there, as he was a
26:03
John Bircher and was really involved in promoting that, and he had a choice
26:10
of either stopping that or quitting.
26:15
He quit.
26:16
And I was fortunate to have inherited his job with a promotion.
26:21
And which forest was that out of Okanagan?
26:24
It's the Okanagan Forest.
26:26
It is the Okanagan, okay.
26:27
I was assigned as the Conconully District Ranger, which bordered
26:31
Canada, a very nice district that had timber management, range,
26:39
recreation, wilderness, that whole bit.
26:44
I stayed there for four years.
26:47
About that time, the Office of Economic Opportunity, one of
26:53
Johnson's [President] programs,
26:58
they came up with the Job Corps program with
27:06
Sargent Shiver as the head.
27:08
The idea was to begin a series of Job Corps centers for
27:16
youth 16 to 21 that were unemployed and needed education, etc. So, Sargent
27:27
Shriver interviewed the first round of
27:30
Center Director candidates, and I was approved and assigned to the Cispus Job
27:36
Corps Center, which is on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest outside of
27:41
Randall, Washington, between the summit there and Chehalis Neck, that country.
27:49
You were just north of Mount St. Helens?
27:51
Right.
27:52
Actually, the Cispus Job Corps Center was 12 miles south of Randall, almost
27:59
in the center of the triangle of Mount Rainer, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams.
28:05
And this was a 225-man corps, it was all men, a center with
28:14
half-time devoted to education, and the other half to work programs.
28:21
We had a staff of 52 people that ranged from my deputy for programs
28:28
who was a district ranger......
28:33
[Break in audio]
28:34
You're down at Cispus, okay.
28:37
Again, we had a staff of 51 people that included cooks and complete residential
28:46
living for these 225 young men.
28:52
Half education, half work, as far as their time went.
28:57
And that lasted, an interesting thing, too, and you may want to
29:03
delete this but when we started that camp, we built it from scratch.
29:10
And before they were actually
29:15
- [Break in audio]
29:15
Okay, back on the record.
29:18
The real reward of that is that we were able to work with people like Boeing and
29:23
other companies and get these kids jobs.
29:27
But one thing is, I was going to mention that maybe is not good for
29:32
the record, I don't know, but when we built that Job Corps Center, it
29:37
was on the Randall District of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.
29:42
And that's just south of the Packwood District, correct?
29:47
Well, it's a little bit west and south.
29:50
Okay.
29:52
So, anyway,
29:57
we were just getting ready to bring our new corpsmen in and
30:03
the majority were blacks or Mexican-Americans, mostly blacks.
30:09
There wasn't a black person anywhere near Randall, Washington.
30:13
And the community was really worried about that.
30:15
And this was still in the kind of the last vestiges of Jim Crow-type of
30:21
mentality, even though we were in the Northwest, and that was less of a problem.
30:25
But I'm trying to tie what you're saying into that?
30:28
Yeah, still particularly in some of these smaller, rural communities,
30:32
there was a concern about that.
30:33
And there were no black people around.
30:36
Well, the dilemma we faced here as a staff, we had all the staff together, and
30:41
we had all the facilities there, and the first corpsmen were going to be coming in.
30:46
And this Job Corps Center was on the Niggerhead Road, and there was a big
30:52
Forest Service sign, Niggerhead Road.
30:55
Which is typical, though, of place names.
30:59
In the Southwest and Utah where I did a lot of research, they had a place called
31:03
Nigger Bill Canyon, which of course, they changed to Negro Bill Canyon, later,
31:08
because, and I'm sure you're going to give me some version of that type of issue.
31:12
Yeah, well, the other thing was that the camp was also on the confluence
31:17
of the Cispus River and Niggerhead Creek, overlooked by Niggerhead
31:23
Rock, this huge towering rock.
31:25
So, we had all these things, and they were all signed.
31:29
And we talked about that at great length by the staff, and what to do about that.
31:35
Because we didn't want to confront the community particularly, because
31:38
they were anti-us there to begin with.
31:41
So, we finally decided, we'll just let it alone, and as the corpsmen
31:46
came in, the partner orientation would be to try to explain this
31:50
thing, how all this developed.
31:53
And we didn't have any trouble with the corpsmen.
31:55
They just, you know, sort of ignored it.
31:57
I guess they were used to that.
31:59
Well, at that time, they had to ignore it because the Civil Rights
32:03
Movement hadn't really gone through its full, you know, evolutions.
32:07
Yeah, but by the time we finished, or
32:12
not finished, but in time, probably about four or five months, these corpsmen
32:17
had won over the Randall community.
32:21
And the community came to us and said, "We think it's time to
32:23
change those names." So, we did.
32:26
And it worked out perfectly.
32:27
So, is now called?
32:29
I forget what we called it [Tower Rock]
32:30
. So, they took any reference away from the ethnicity or the race?
32:34
Yeah, it wouldn't be "Negro Creek" or anything like that, because
32:38
Niggerhead had a different connotation.
32:40
Well, yeah, I know.
32:41
But anyway, that's certainly a starting point.
32:43
No, but that's an interesting story, and those type of place-naming dynamics
32:49
have happened all across the United States, as the culture has changed.
32:53
Yeah, Squaw Creek and all these names are slowly being changed.
32:57
Well, after about a year, I was reassigned to the Washington office, Chief's Office
33:08
in Washington, D.C., as part of the Job Corps staff there, and dealt primarily
33:18
with the work programs in Job Corps, and I traveled around the country and did that.
33:23
During that period, I was at the end of it, assigned to Vice President
33:28
Humphrey's office, as I mentioned before.
33:32
Then I was selected for the Cornell
33:37
education program, and completed that, and when I finished with Cornell, I
33:44
was assigned to the Sierra National Forest in California out of Fresno,
33:50
as the assistant forest supervisor.
33:55
Within about four months, the supervisor retired and I replaced him as the
34:02
forest supervisor of the Sierra, and that was kind of planned in that way.
34:06
I was selected.
34:08
This was before the days when you had to apply for jobs.
34:13
I never applied for a single job in the Forest Service.
34:16
Well, back in the early days, and we're going to talk more about the esprit de
34:19
corps of the Forest Service, which you obviously would know more than even a lot
34:24
of other Forest Service people I've met because of your multigenerational lineage.
34:30
But back then, in the quasi-military model of the Forest Service, you moved
34:35
station to station to station to station, your career very much followed that
34:41
particular mode of how you went around.
34:45
Because you had how many stations your first 12-15 years there?
34:48
Well, I didn't count them up, but a lot, yeah.
34:51
A lot.
34:51
Yeah, and I know this, too, my wife, and wives have a lot of
34:56
credit in supporting us, obviously.
34:58
Now, did this work for you and the family?
35:00
I mean, this must have been hard, as it's always a challenge for people
35:03
going from one remote place to another?
35:05
Yeah, and Betty had never lived anywhere except Chinook, Montana, on the ranches.
35:11
And she joined me, and this is her 32nd house that she's put together for us,
35:18
32nd house in 60 years of marriage.
35:22
And we've lived in this house 12 years, so there's a bunch of them.
35:25
This is a world record for you guys.
35:28
Yeah.
35:29
So, anyway,
35:35
the Sierra National Forest was my first opportunity to be a forest supervisor.
35:41
And it's a nice forest.
35:43
And what year exactly was this?
35:45
That was 1968.
35:48
So, this was right on the cusp of what was becoming the environmental
35:52
era, both in terms of laws that were passed, and cultures changing as well?
35:56
That's right.
35:56
On the Sierra, we experienced Earth Day in April of that year.
36:02
1970.
36:02
'70, yeah.
36:05
And we really kind of turned that forest around in terms of trying to
36:11
catch up with the rest of society.
36:17
It's never been an easy job for the Forest Service to change
36:20
that fast, but I think in some instances we did a pretty good job.
36:26
In 1970, I was promoted to forest supervisor of the
36:31
Willamette National Forest here.
36:34
And that was when French Pete was going and all these controversies were going.
36:41
The forest supervisor I replaced, retired, but he was paranoid.
36:45
He thought these environmentalists were going to kill him and all kinds
36:49
of things were happening there.
36:51
Well, as it turned out, I was able to come in here and meet with him, and we really
36:56
developed a very positive relationship with the environmental community here
37:01
without alienating the timber companies.
37:07
In fact, in those days, there was a kind of a courtesy and understanding
37:12
among the various positions.
37:14
It didn't get nasty like we are now, where people are protesting
37:20
and burning up Forest Service offices and that kind of thing.
37:24
That was before the Earth First!
37:26
type of aggressive tactics?
37:29
Exactly.
37:30
That was probably starting about then, but people like Dick Noyes
37:34
and a whole bunch of other people,
37:39
Sandy Tepfer, they were just real solid people, but really environmentalists,
37:45
our environmentalists of the day.
37:49
We got along just fine with them.
37:51
But in this forest, it was by far the largest timber-producing
37:56
forest in the whole system.
37:58
The Willamette?
37:59
Willamette.
38:00
We scaled two years in a row over a billion board-feet of timber,
38:05
including those that were dead.
38:07
And that really was even at that time, I began to realize, we were probably
38:15
not going to be able to sustain that.
38:18
In fact, this was the first time I saw a satellite picture in the winter
38:21
time, and saw all those white spots.
38:24
Where the clear-cuts had happened?
38:25
Clear-cuts had happened.
38:26
Then I knew we were in a position where we had to change things.
38:31
And French Pete was a big deal, but going from the Willamette National
38:38
Forest, I was then promoted to the Senior Executive Corps in the government, to
38:47
Director of Recreation and Wilderness Cultural Values Trails, so all that whole
38:51
business, in Washington, D.C. I told the Chief, "I'm going to get whiplash here,
38:59
going from the biggest timber forest to recreation wilderness, all in one crack."
39:05
But I had the chance to deal with the so-called RARE I, Roadless Area Review,
39:13
of the sector the first time around here, and then went back to Washington,
39:18
D.C. as the Director of Recreation.
39:20
Now, when did RARE I happen?
39:22
That happened in about mid-'70s.
39:26
That was before the 1976 Act [National Forest Management Act] , correct?
39:29
Or was it after?
39:30
It was before.
39:31
That was before, yeah.
39:32
Yeah, a little before.
39:32
Because it was in response to the Wilderness Act [RARE I]
39:34
. Yeah.
39:35
More or less.
39:37
Well, we were trying to figure out how to round out the wilderness system.
39:41
And RARE I was a Forest Service initiated effort to see what was
39:47
left and how much of that should go into wilderness and how much should
39:50
be released to other kinds of uses.
39:53
Also how to merge with existing primitive areas, which was a Forest Service
39:58
wilderness designation [primitive] long before the Wilderness Act?
40:01
Yeah, like the Gila, for example [In New Mexico]
40:02
. Yes, exactly.
40:06
Anyway, back in Washington,
40:11
I was staff director for recreation and all that business.
40:17
That's where we finally ended up doing RARE II.
40:22
RARE II was under my responsibility at that time.
40:31
Rupe Cutler was the Assistant Secretary for the Forest Service
40:34
and SES, and he came across a fellow named George Davis, who was then the
40:43
Director of the Wilderness Society.
40:47
He brought George over to the Forest Service on my staff to
40:51
help run and develop the RARE II program, and it was a good program.
40:58
It failed in some respects, but it did daylight in a very good way what was left
41:05
and what should be considered wilderness.
41:08
It's still being dealt with.
41:12
But it is somewhat maligned, because people didn't get exactly
41:18
what they wanted on either side.
41:21
But isn't that they're supposed to say, when, you know you did a job if
41:25
you angered both sides of the debate?
41:27
Yeah, I don't like that philosophy, but it happened.
41:31
You understand.
41:32
You found a middle ground, is the meaning of it.
41:33
Yeah, and sometimes the middle ground is not the right place to be.
41:37
Sometimes, you need to take a more positive position.
41:41
But sometimes there's some middle ground.
41:43
We're such a polarized country now, and everything is polarized.
41:48
We need to come back towards the middle with, you know, opposite
41:53
views, but not way-out there.
41:56
I always refer to Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen, how they managed
42:00
to fight it out on the Senate floor.
42:04
Then go out for a drink afterwards?
42:05
Go out for a beer afterwards, after they settled it.
42:07
You know, and that doesn't happen anymore.
42:09
It's just a complete nasty situation.
42:12
And the Forest Service is being harmed by that greatly, in my view, as I look back.
42:18
Talking about from the Washington and even state level political, or are you
42:23
talking about broader cultural dynamics?
42:25
Well, both.
42:27
Both, okay.
42:30
So, anyway, at the end of my tour there, I was reassigned, still in the Senior
42:37
Executive Program to the Regional Forester in San Francisco, that's our Region 5,
42:44
which constitutes the 17 national forests in California, plus -- [clock chimes].
42:50
Off the record for a
42:54
minute.
42:54
[Break in audio]
42:54
Where were we here?
42:55
You were talking about San Francisco, your multiple responsibilities?
42:59
Yeah.
43:00
So, we moved to San Francisco, and
43:05
which covered California, Hawaii and Micronesia, and
43:12
a huge budget, and about 12,000 people on the employment list.
43:22
A great staff, and plenty of money, and it kind of went down from there
43:28
in terms of austerity and difficulty.
43:31
Because budgets started being slashed during the Reagan years, right?
43:36
That's right.
43:36
Yes.
43:39
Well,
43:43
in California, a big job was in fire, a huge fire situation.
43:50
We were cutting at one point, almost two billion board-feet of timber a year.
43:58
We had all these, a big recreation program and so forth, and
44:04
then the austerity program began to hit and this really affected us a lot.
44:10
We had to do some things about it.
44:12
So, a couple of things I tried to do.
44:15
One, was to convince the Chief [Forest Service] that we needed to reduce
44:18
the size of these regional offices.
44:22
Organizationally, there's a chief in the regional office and the supervisor's
44:25
office, and then the district rangers.
44:28
We kept stealing from the district ranger, and to some extent the
44:32
forest supervisor, to maintain the chief's office at each level, and
44:37
the regional office of its level.
44:40
Our regional office, when I got there, had 1,000 people in that office.
44:44
A regional office?
44:45
A regional office.
44:46
Wow.
44:46
In the region, we had 12,000 employees.
44:49
Now, this included temporary people.
44:50
You're talking about the Southwest Region, right?
44:52
Well, it's the Pacific Southwest.
44:54
Pacific Southwest, that's what I meant.
44:55
Yeah, Region 5.
44:57
PNW, then there's the Pacific Southwest [PSW] , right.
45:00
Yeah.
45:03
PNW's research.
45:05
Right, I meant Region 6, actually.
45:05
Yeah, Region 6, yeah.
45:08
I get them confused sometimes.
45:10
So, I proposed to Max Peterson, the chief at that time, that we restructure the
45:20
regional office and make it a chief's representative to head a small group
45:26
of people that helped make sure that
45:31
direction coming down would fit and be monitored in the region.
45:37
I said, "We've got 1,000 people now, I'd like to go to 100, and I'm going
45:42
to put all those surplus people back on the ranger districts in the forest."
45:48
Max said, "Well, it's worth a try." But the staff directors and others in
45:54
Washington, D.C. just went berserk.
45:57
There's no way, and Max said, "We can't do it now." So, we didn't.
46:02
So, we were cutting about two billion board-feet of timber a year, and that
46:09
was well beyond what we could stand.
46:12
It was a little bit like the Willamette, as there's other values that were more
46:16
important than the timber production.
46:18
And California was that in spades.
46:21
So, I began working with the forest supervisors and we were told by the
46:27
Chief and others, don't accept any targets beyond what you can produce.
46:33
Well, that was just verbiage because every time we tried to reduce
46:38
the harvest, we got torpedoed.
46:41
Was this because of political pressure or industry pressure,
46:46
or a combination of both?
46:47
Combination of both, plus feelings of a lot of older Forest Service people.
46:52
That was still the mission.
46:53
Yeah, the mission.
46:54
The definition of multiple-use for them was weighted more toward the
46:58
utilitarian economic production aspect.
47:01
Correct?
47:01
Yes, that's right, that's right.
47:03
You're dealing with all that stuff and it wasn't working out very well.
47:08
So,
47:11
the forest supervisors and I agreed that we just couldn't continue
47:18
the level of production of timber.
47:20
Then, I met with the timber industry, which I did frequently at their
47:26
meetings, and I announced to them that I felt they had ought to get
47:31
ready for a reduction in production to about 1.5 billion instead of two.
47:38
Well, I did that on a Thursday, I announced that to them.
47:43
And Monday, the next Monday, the chief called me and said, "The Secretary of
47:50
Agriculture's coming out to your region, he does not want you present. He's meeting
47:55
with the industry." And within a week, I was in effect removed from my position.
48:04
And this was in what year?
48:06
That was in nineteen-eighty,
48:13
about 1988.
48:15
So, it was the end of the Reagan years?
48:21
Yeah, was it Reagan, or I'm not sure who was President?
48:25
Well, or Bush.
48:25
But I mean, the '80s were a much more conservative interpretation of land use,
48:32
at least from the top down, and in terms of whatever administration was directing.
48:38
Yeah, well, being in the Senior Executive Corps, I had no recourse.
48:42
I had to accept that.
48:43
I accepted that
48:46
when I went into it, and they didn't have to have a cause.
48:50
They could just remove you from those positions, and
48:53
they were usually pretty kind.
48:54
They would offer you a similar job somewhere else.
48:59
But the Secretary was so convinced that he said, "We need a change in
49:03
Region 5." That was because of that comment I made, and Sierra Pacific
49:10
kind of led the gang, and they got me.
49:15
That's a timber company.
49:16
A timber company, a big one, in California.
49:20
So, I was offered the
49:26
regional forester position in Denver.
49:29
And I said, "I have to decline that because my elderly parents can't
49:34
even visit us at that elevation." They both had heart problems.
49:39
So, Dale Robertson was the Chief and he said, "Well, you can come to Washington
49:46
and be Associate Deputy Chief." I'd been to Washington twice already, and I wasn't
49:53
about to do that again, and I was 54 years old, and with 34 years' service.
50:00
So I elected to retire.
50:03
I asked him to give me about four or five months more, so I was the right age.
50:09
Thirty-five years, right?
50:11
Yeah, and
50:14
we developed what we call the "Recreation Initiative." We had
50:21
a real-good look at recreation service-wide, and then I retired.
50:26
I retired early when we came up here.
50:29
I've never felt bad about that because I knew exactly what was going to happen,
50:33
and I think I did the right thing.
50:35
Kind of like Jack Ward Thomas, I'm proud of having been fired for that reason.
50:42
And I've been on the other side of it, too, where I was promoting more timber and
50:47
this and that, and I'd just accept those things that I can't do anything about.
50:54
But, you know, I still hold to my principles.
50:58
And I think,
51:00
some of the chiefs have not really adhered to that like Jack Ward Thomas has.
51:04
The Forest Service is having a lot of trouble, and some of it is
51:10
contrary to our mission and even the basic tenets of the Forest Service.
51:18
I just feel like we're in a lot of trouble in that respect.
51:23
It's not easy to be chief of the Forest Service, and particularly, when you have
51:28
an administration that is practically in his pocket all the time, or her pocket.
51:33
Well, I think for the first, I guess you'd say, 50 to even 60 or
51:38
70 years maybe, the Forest Service hierarchy was more determined by,
51:44
well, it was more of a meritocracy.
51:47
You had people that rose to the top more based on abilities and what they're doing.
51:52
And I think in the last 30 years, reflecting the increasing polarization
51:58
of the culture and politics, positions have become more political
52:02
appointees, more patronage-oriented, would you agree with that?
52:08
Oh, I agree with that.
52:08
And I think the members of Congress, both Senate and House, have
52:12
less understanding of the rural situation and natural resources.
52:18
They're dealing with these huge populations on the East and West Coasts.
52:23
That's the way politics is.
52:25
And you know, Oregon might just as well give up voting,
52:30
because everything's decided
52:34
before we're voting.
52:36
I don't know what you do about something like that, except for education,
52:42
somehow educating the urban population and the members of Congress that
52:48
represent them, how important it is to
52:53
provide stewardship and use our natural resources in a positive way.
52:59
Right now, we are letting things get away from us without any kind of management.
53:05
We're putting out, still putting out fires, and they're huge fires now.
53:11
But we don't have any timber program to kind of mitigate that.
53:18
And we've got bugs coming in and we've got big fires, and we're
53:22
losing the national forests.
53:25
If you go through almost any place where there's adjacent lands, either
53:29
private or reservation lands, you don't need a sign that tells you
53:34
when you're in the national forest.
53:36
There's a huge difference already.
53:37
And how would you describe that difference?
53:39
Well, I'll take Arizona, for example.
53:42
I was just down there not too long ago.
53:44
And going through the Indian reservation where the stands
53:50
were healthy, there was no
53:56
increased density that was going to cause problems.
53:59
And you cross that line and you see lighter fuels all the way
54:02
up to the crowns, and complete density, bugs, the whole thing.
54:09
Now, I take it maybe you're speaking of the Apache reservations [White Mountain
54:13
and San Carlos] and the Apache-Sitgreaves and Coconino [National Forests]
54:16
interfaces in that big area there?
54:17
Yeah, all that big area there.
54:19
I mean, it's very big.
54:20
And you see it here, too.
54:21
You see private lands and Indian lands that are managed and producing,
54:30
and healthy, healthy ecosystems.
54:32
Move into the national forest and, you know, you've got a different situation.
54:37
Now, let's go back to the beginning, when you started your Forest
54:42
Service career and you started hopping around to all these places,
54:47
because you changed stations so many times, and not only stations,
54:53
but you changed eco-regions.
54:56
Sure.
54:57
In other words, you went basically over all of the West, giving you
55:01
pretty much the whole spectrum.
55:06
How did that affect your view on forest management?
55:12
That diverse experience, kind of the circular movement
55:15
around the West, if you will?
55:17
Well, I think it was based on the Forest Service premise that that
55:21
kind of thing was necessary to become a good field manager, for example.
55:27
And I think it was useful in that respect.
55:30
On the other hand, I think we failed to recognize some of the technical
55:36
people in the Forest Service, like a silviculturist, or an archaeologist.
55:45
In order for them to get any grade, they either have to move or go into a
55:49
line position, and that's not very good.
55:53
So a district ranger, for example, might be a Grade 12 or a 13, a GS-13.
56:01
And a silviculturist might be a Grade 9, and they are a Grade 9, whether
56:06
he's an apprentice, or a journeyman, or a master - it doesn't matter.
56:12
So, it's hard for them to move up while being that type?
56:15
They have to move away to do that.
56:17
To a managerial track of some kind.
56:19
Well, managerial or to a higher level in the silviculture classification.
56:25
And that's really not very good.
56:28
It denies these specialists recognition for salary and grade and so forth.
56:38
It doesn't bother me at all, if the ranger's a 13, a
56:41
silviculturist could be a 13, too.
56:42
A silviculturist has
56:45
its own job, and the ranger has his leadership job.
56:49
And I think we need to move more towards that than we have in the past.
56:54
I've always felt badly about that.
56:57
It's been hard with the Civil Service rigidity in promoting people like that.
57:04
The line manager has to be a higher grade.
57:07
Well, the line manager has a totally different job.
57:11
And this is just kind of a curious thing.
57:16
Now, let's take your first 20 years.
57:16
This
57:21
was from the time in the 1950's when
57:25
the culture was much different.
57:29
Industrial forestry was starting to become more central.
57:33
And then 20 years later, post-Earth Day, post-NEPA, this whole really seismic
57:41
shift in many respects, it happened.
57:45
You want to characterize how you observed that as you were moving around?
57:51
Well, I think it was something that so many of us didn't
57:56
realize what was happening.
57:58
And I think we've all been guilty of wishing we were back where, you
58:03
know, the way we did it before.
58:06
Everybody waxes for the good-old days.
58:09
And that's not good.
58:10
I mean,
58:16
I think our traditional values should not change.
58:20
Traditional values are important.
58:23
But traditional methods have to be changed to meet these values, particularly
58:28
in the context of social priorities.
58:32
And I always felt that, you know, whatever the people want us to do on
58:36
these forests is what we should do, as long as it doesn't damage the health
58:43
and well-being of the natural resources.
58:46
We shouldn't worry about that, that's such a political issue.
58:49
And our job is to make sure we're within the framework of good ecosystem
58:58
management.
58:58
And that term [ecosystem] had not really hadn't entered the picture back then.
59:01
What was the role of science
59:06
that first 20 years?
59:07
And of course, and I'm speaking about before you came to the Willamette,
59:11
and we're going to talk more about the Andrews [H.J. Andrews Experimental
59:13
Forest] , science and its applications, as we get further along here.
59:17
But what was the role of science, and later on, you'd have the explosion of
59:22
what some people call the "ologists" into these specialty positions.
59:26
But that first 20 years, it was a little different, or it was
59:30
starting to change at the end?
59:32
Well, I think foresters and the education they had at that time, they were pretty
59:37
well-rounded, but they didn't encounter all these demands that intensified
59:44
the recognition of archaeology, or watersheds or soils, that sort of thing.
59:52
We weren't doing things that were going to disrupt that, and that was a
59:56
period of time when it didn't matter.
59:58
But during that period you've talked about regarding the "ologists," we
1:00:03
started bringing in these experts.
1:00:06
And then some of our leaders, rangers and forest supervisors, were unable to
1:00:11
meld them into an interdisciplinary team with the traditional values in mind.
1:00:20
They wanted to keep going back to the traditional methods, which
1:00:24
wasn't going to work very well.
1:00:26
And the "ologists" became sort of outliers.
1:00:30
And some district rangers did a good job, some just ignored them, and thought they
1:00:36
were just a pain in the neck, you know.
1:00:40
Pointy-headed specialists.
1:00:42
Right?
1:00:42
Yeah.
1:00:43
And it's just a matter of everybody keeping their eye on what the
1:00:47
mission is and where we want to be.
1:00:49
And then everybody, you know, forging together to get there,
1:00:52
all going in the same direction instead of going all different ways.
1:00:56
Because when they start going different ways, it's hard to pull them
1:00:58
back into your objective over here.
1:01:02
And of course, we went through a whole lot of kinds of organizational development
1:01:07
with training and ideas and so forth, and we got some good things done that way.
1:01:12
But it doesn't always work.
1:01:14
It varies a lot by geographic area and individuals, the rangers, etc.
1:01:26
Describe some of the most important legislation that affected how foresters
1:01:33
did their job and impacted what you did, and the 1960 Forest Act, Wilderness
1:01:39
Act, obviously in '64, NEPA, '69-'70, and then the 1976 Forest Act, those
1:01:46
are the ones that come to mind.
1:01:47
But do you want to describe how you would any of those particular acts and how
1:01:52
they affected what you guys did in the Forest Service, but you specifically?
1:01:56
Sure.
1:01:57
Well, the Wilderness Act is pretty straight and clear.
1:02:00
I don't think you can do much about accusing of not
1:02:07
being able to deal with it.
1:02:11
The other acts are good.
1:02:14
It's resulted in some undue
1:02:18
planning that just continues on and on and on and on.
1:02:22
But I think more important, would be some of these other acts like the
1:02:29
Clean Water Act, and some of these other things that began to, they almost are
1:02:35
akin to the "ologists" or they start driving some of these basic overall
1:02:40
acts, or undermining them to such a degree that you can't accomplish
1:02:46
the Multiple-Use Act or whatever.
1:02:51
NEPA is, I think, okay.
1:02:55
But NEPA can get off on tangents as well.
1:03:00
We probably have too many acts.
1:03:01
We need to go back to the "use book theory" and find out, what is the
1:03:06
mission and how can we best get there given what the people want within the
1:03:12
constraints of the resource itself.
1:03:15
And I don't really have too much of opinion about any one particular
1:03:21
act, except that they kind of get at cross purposes from time-to-time.
1:03:26
Now, you mentioned earlier the French Pete controversy, which was going on
1:03:32
when you came to the Willamette, right?
1:03:35
It started before, way back.
1:03:37
It did, yeah.
1:03:38
Do you want to describe that whole tussle and how it was resolved?
1:03:45
Well, you're right, the previous forest supervisor [Willamette] was trying
1:03:51
to hold the line for timber harvest and business as usual in that place.
1:03:55
And he didn't feel like it was wilderness.
1:03:59
It was a lower elevation, we had a lot of wilderness already in
1:04:03
the Willamette, and his position was no more wilderness, basically.
1:04:09
That just flew in the face of the environmentalists, who really wanted
1:04:12
to save that [French Pete] . They had some good reasons, too, because it was
1:04:15
a lower elevation, it was untouched, beautiful country, and it was pretty
1:04:21
much contiguous to the Three Sisters.
1:04:27
I think that stimulated the whole controversy.
1:04:34
When I came, I tried to mitigate that a bit by backing off of the
1:04:39
planned timber harvest, and making it more acceptable, you might say,
1:04:46
but that just went on and on and on.
1:04:49
And we just could never quite get there.
1:04:53
And finally, it was designated wilderness.
1:04:56
How many acres did they add to the Three Sisters?
1:04:58
[Wilderness]
1:04:58
Oh, seems to me it was about 17,000 acres.
1:05:01
I may be off on that.
1:05:02
I don't know.
1:05:02
But it's basically up in the Olallie, French Pete, that whole area up there?
1:05:07
Right, and it's a pretty nice, self-contained drainage.
1:05:10
And like you say, pretty much contiguous to the Three Sisters.
1:05:15
I recall when I was a youth growing up in Eugene, hearing
1:05:18
about French Pete, even from my arch-conservative Boy Scout Scoutmaster.
1:05:24
By today's standards, he's a tea partier.
1:05:27
But he was all in favor of the wilderness.
1:05:30
It was strange bedfellows, you know, when it's your favorite place
1:05:34
or one of your favorite places.
1:05:35
But I remember hearing that, but I had no sophistication or background in it,
1:05:39
so I learned about it only later on.
1:05:43
One thing we did do; the environmentalists were really concerned
1:05:48
about the way we were building the roads and destroying trails.
1:05:56
We had these five-year action plans for timber sales, and
1:05:59
we'd project them by hand.
1:06:00
And we could see that it was just going to be one controversy right after another.
1:06:04
Each one would be fought on its own.
1:06:07
So, we instigated what we called, "Sales and Trails Breakfasts."
1:06:13
We had the industry and environmentalists meet with us in
1:06:17
Albany, kind of a neutral place.
1:06:20
And we had these breakfasts and we went through the entire five-year
1:06:24
action plan and adjusted it.
1:06:26
The environmentalists were happy and the timber industry was happy.
1:06:30
But those are the kind of negotiations that kind of help bring people together.
1:06:38
Nobody got everything they wanted, but they got enough to make it work well.
1:06:43
The other thing we did was with the environmentalists, just to get a
1:06:48
little better relationship with them, Betty and I hosted what we called the
1:06:53
"Almaden Associates." And we invited all these arch-environmentalists to
1:07:00
our house in west Eugene at that time.
1:07:03
And this was in the '80s?
1:07:05
This was in the '70s.
1:07:06
'70s, okay.
1:07:07
Mid-'70s.
1:07:07
And I had bottle of Almaden Chablis or whatever it was, and we just came
1:07:15
together and had a little wine and discussion, and you know, it was
1:07:20
remarkable what we were able to do.
1:07:24
Now, back then, what were the groups that were active?
1:07:27
Sierra Club.
1:07:28
Mostly the Sierra Club?
1:07:29
Mostly, the Sierra Club, yeah.
1:07:30
All these people, I think, were members of the Sierra Club.
1:07:32
Wasn't there also an Oregon Natural Resources Council at that time?
1:07:36
You know, I don't recall.
1:07:37
Which I think became the father of the Oregon Wild, I think.
1:07:40
Yeah, yeah.
1:07:42
They may have been around, but weren't prominent here.
1:07:45
I think Sierra Club is pretty much it, and Wilderness Society, to some extent.
1:07:50
But a lot of these people were the same ones.
1:07:52
So, we'd catch them all at one time, and a lot of them were
1:07:55
University of Oregon professors.
1:07:59
Dick Noyes was a professor, Sandy Tepfer, and several others.
1:08:05
But they were good and reasonable people.
1:08:08
And when we gave them a chance to function in that more collaborative
1:08:13
way, they were willing to give a bit.
1:08:17
It's interesting, when you put people in the same room in these
1:08:21
conversational formats, and throw a little alcohol in probably as a perk,
1:08:27
it's amazing how people who will lob grenades at each other, verbal
1:08:31
grenades, when in different scenarios, will at least be able to converse?
1:08:37
Yeah.
1:08:37
Often.
1:08:38
I think so.
1:08:38
And that's true.
1:08:41
Now, you said that when you came to the Willamette, it was the
1:08:45
number one producing national forest in the whole system.
1:08:53
How long did it take you to realize that what was going on was not sustainable,
1:08:58
and how did you perceive that this needed to be changed or amended or scaled back?
1:09:04
Yeah.
1:09:05
Well, the first thing that caught my eye, as I said before, was the
1:09:10
satellite picture of the forest with all those round white spots, clear-cuts.
1:09:17
I knew we couldn't sustain that.
1:09:21
And we were pretty much aware that more and more, there was going to
1:09:25
be a priority on non-timber values.
1:09:30
And
1:09:32
that just led on.
1:09:34
Then we had RARE I, and we had RARE II.
1:09:38
But there were very entrenched political and economic interests
1:09:42
that had certain expectations, so how do you deal with that?
1:09:46
Yeah, we dealt with it like these "Sales and Trails Breakfasts,"
1:09:49
and my "Almaden Associates," and we tried to find common ground.
1:09:57
We were probably still behind the curve, because it still happened and when I
1:10:02
got down to California, it was when I finally lost my job because of that.
1:10:06
Right.
1:10:07
Because we couldn't keep up with it.
1:10:09
Exactly.
1:10:11
You know, it just probably lopped over too far the other side now.
1:10:17
Now, we have no capability of milling or logging.
1:10:23
And we're destroying forests in Malaysia and Indonesia and all
1:10:29
those places, at their expense, and ours are just sitting here idling.
1:10:36
How would you describe the Forest Service and the relations with local
1:10:42
communities, early in your career?
1:10:45
Well, this first 20 years, I mean, when things were different?
1:10:50
Yeah.
1:10:50
Early in my career and certainly during my dad's and granddad's career, the
1:10:56
Forest Service was part of the community.
1:10:59
If you look at it today, you'll find that most of the rangers don't even
1:11:03
live in the community any more, they live in Eugene and commute to Oakridge.
1:11:07
Yeah,
1:11:09
Oakridge.
1:11:12
So, there's a loss there.
1:11:15
Also, the consolidation of ranger districts.
1:11:19
The three major ranger districts on the Willamette, Oakridge, Lowell,
1:11:26
and the Rigdon, huge districts.
1:11:31
Big timber programs.
1:11:34
Each one of them had a timber program bigger than most forests in the system.
1:11:39
We combined all three of those into one ranger district.
1:11:43
And you know, the ranger becomes remote.
1:11:46
And he was even remote, lived in Eugene, and still does.
1:11:52
So, we've lost that community tie.
1:11:55
It used to be it was easy because we were all out there working with
1:12:01
the people and knew the people.
1:12:03
And the wives and families were integrated into the community.
1:12:06
So, that's not the case anymore.
1:12:09
It's quite a lot different.
1:12:12
I mean, some of the McKenzie District people live up the McKenzie, and
1:12:16
I think even the Detroit District or Sweet Home District, they
1:12:20
live sort of up there, right?
1:12:22
Right.
1:12:23
Part of them live in, I don't know where the ranger lives now, and probably
1:12:28
still in Detroit, and probably Sweet Home, but a lot of the staff live other
1:12:32
places, Lebanon, or wherever it is.
1:12:37
And McKenzie, there's a lot of people who live in Eugene in the McKenzie.
1:12:43
And I think Terry Baker, ranger at the McKenzie District
1:12:46
was a good one, a top guy.
1:12:49
He's a black guy, and he's just a sweetheart.
1:12:54
And I think he lives up there.
1:12:56
And you know, he was named
1:13:00
"Person of the Year" or something by the McKenzie people, not the Forest
1:13:05
Service, but the community up there.
1:13:08
And so, it's still possible.
1:13:12
Now, that really wasn't going to be one of my central questions,
1:13:15
but I will bring it up.
1:13:19
The gender, racial and ethnic makeup of the Forest Service was
1:13:23
very Caucasian when you came in.
1:13:27
And male.
1:13:27
And male.
1:13:28
And how did that change over the time that you were in the Forest Service?
1:13:33
Well, you may be aware of the Consent Decree that was issued in California.
1:13:40
The Pacific Southwest Research Station was taken to court because they felt that
1:13:48
the scientists were, you know, basically men, and the negotiations to resolve
1:13:56
that issue, the Forest Service signed a Consent Decree that embraced Region 5
1:14:01
and the National Forest System as well.
1:14:04
And boy, I tell you, that was something else.
1:14:08
The Consent Decree, there was a monitor and the court oversight, and we had to
1:14:13
make progress in getting more women in the pipeline and in proper positions.
1:14:20
But it was mainly targeted at women, correct?
1:14:22
That was women, yeah.
1:14:24
Yeah.
1:14:24
Now, we've always had a fairly strong Civil Rights program, but without a
1:14:30
Consent Decree, that I'm aware of.
1:14:33
And
1:14:36
it's somewhat difficult, because the black community, principally
1:14:40
urban, has no interest in forestry.
1:14:46
They have the same problem in the National Park Service, to some degree.
1:14:49
Right, I think any rural type or natural resource agency
1:14:53
probably has trouble with this.
1:14:55
But women are a little bit stronger, I think, in making progress.
1:15:01
A lot of women are wildlife biologists, for example, and they're
1:15:05
rising right up in these agencies.
1:15:07
The Forest Service Consent Decree did its job.
1:15:11
I mean, we've had, two or three chiefs that have been women.
1:15:15
And as you look at the Forest Service now, probably almost half,
1:15:20
well, probably not half, a lot of them, are forest supervisors.
1:15:23
There's been several regional foresters.
1:15:27
Some of them are good and some of them are not good.
1:15:29
And we've had some real issues where women have not had the
1:15:36
experience, or the seasoning, I guess, to be top line leaders.
1:15:44
They kind of want to make all the decisions themselves, instead of, being
1:15:49
a leader, and allowing people to function independent towards that mission,
1:15:55
but they have to make the decision.
1:15:58
That's always been one of the questions that the skeptics question about the whole
1:16:03
Affirmative Action type of dynamic, where,
1:16:08
even though they don't want to call it a quota system, it kind of is.
1:16:11
And you sometimes may put people in a position that, based on
1:16:18
pure meritocracy, and abilities that might not be quite there.
1:16:21
Right.
1:16:22
To fulfill a broader social mission, shall we say.
1:16:26
And I think that that's happened, certainly.
1:16:31
So,
1:16:35
in terms of science,
1:16:41
what role did science have when you first started, and how did that
1:16:46
change by the time you got to the Willamette, and then I'm going to
1:16:49
ask you specifically about research stations like the Andrews, or any other
1:16:55
experiment stations, Wind River, there's ones all over, Fort Valley, Arizona.
1:17:00
You've been exposed to some of them, more or less.
1:17:03
But just tell me about the role of science when you started, how that
1:17:06
evolved, and then I'm going to ask you specific questions about the H.J. Andrews.
1:17:10
Yeah, okay.
1:17:11
Well, I think reaching clear back into my granddad's time, research in the National
1:17:18
Forest System had some collaboration, and a lot of friendships that promoted
1:17:28
collaboration and exchange of information.
1:17:33
I can remember specific people that my grandparents, my granddad, relied on.
1:17:40
The same thing happened with my dad.
1:17:43
I think he was quite aware of those folks.
1:17:49
I think there's been a somewhat of a drift away from that, and not so much with
1:17:56
the Andrews, but just kind of generally.
1:17:59
And research got off on one side, and the National Forest System on the other side.
1:18:07
In my own career, I've really valued research because it tends to give
1:18:19
us some answers towards adjusting National Forest methods that are more
1:18:27
consistent with social values that occur.
1:18:37
I'll reserve the Andrews for something later.
1:18:40
But
1:18:42
as a regional forester, I was very close to the Director of the
1:18:47
Pacific Southwest Research Station.
1:18:49
We skied together, we hiked together, we collaborated together.
1:18:56
I called on him and his people to help us with issues that we didn't seem to
1:19:01
understand and know just quite what to do.
1:19:03
Like on the Six Rivers [National Forest] , where you've got
1:19:05
that very unstable country
1:19:09
where the mountains are rising and the streams are cutting into the soil.
1:19:12
Talking about northern California, right?
1:19:14
Yeah, and kind of like the Siuslaw [National Forest] . The Siuslaw
1:19:17
has got some of the same issues.
1:19:21
I think there's been a fairly-good relationship in the reliance,
1:19:26
but it varies by individuals.
1:19:30
And I think you have to finally realize that the only way to get
1:19:35
the job done is to call on science.
1:19:39
I've never had any trouble with that.
1:19:41
Some people do.
1:19:43
And some scientists are, there's a few scientists that are really
1:19:49
strong on herbicides, and that's kind of against the social medium, too.
1:19:58
Well, yeah, you know, that some of the real groundbreaking science in terms of
1:20:04
herbicides happened at the PNW Station.
1:20:08
I mean, some of the early research on DDT and all the different chemicals, you know,
1:20:13
that they were just taken for granted.
1:20:15
They used to put them everywhere in the forest, when you started, right?
1:20:20
Yeah.
1:20:20
Oh, I can remember on the Okanagan, standing there with a
1:20:23
flag and getting sprayed with DDT.
1:20:25
You know, I'm still alive, but.....
1:20:27
Yeah,
1:20:29
but if some animal had eaten you, you would have gone into the food
1:20:34
chain and poisoned the food chain.
1:20:37
[Laughs]
1:20:38
Yeah.
1:20:39
No, the attitude was very different.
1:20:42
Do you ever remember reading Rachel Carson's Silent Spring?
1:20:46
I did, yes.
1:20:46
And did that make an impact on you?
1:20:48
Yeah, I appreciated it.
1:20:49
Yeah, DDT.
1:20:50
It was the early '60s.
1:20:54
I mean, well, DDT and all the other chemicals.
1:20:56
And the eagles, that's what saved our eagles.
1:21:00
Yeah, exactly.
1:21:02
The highest animals on the food chain were the most susceptible, because it
1:21:05
would concentrate up the trophic levels.
1:21:16
Sand Almanac.
1:21:16
Sand County Almanac.
1:21:17
Sand County Almanac, I read that about a once a year.
1:21:18
Aldo Leopold, yeah.
1:21:19
And you know, there's good advice there.
1:21:23
Yeah, and I was referring to whether your grandfather or your father
1:21:27
knew Aldo Leopold, or met him?
1:21:30
I don't know if he did, or not.
1:21:31
Yeah, I mean.
1:21:31
Bob Marshall, he did.
1:21:33
Oh, they met Bob Marshall?
1:21:35
Really?
1:21:35
[Co-founder, Wilderness Society]
1:21:36
Yeah.
1:21:36
And he had a rather short life.
1:21:38
He did.
1:21:39
Yeah, and tell me about their interactions with Bob Marshall?
1:21:42
You know, I just know that they were.
1:21:43
Just know that they met, okay, right.
1:21:47
Now, there is theoretical science, often called basic science,
1:21:51
and there is applied science.
1:21:54
Now, how would you define these categories, and in regards to research
1:21:58
sites like the Andrews and other experimental forests or research stations,
1:22:02
what responsibilities do you think scientists have in applying their research
1:22:07
towards something practical or useable?
1:22:10
Well, I think that's really important.
1:22:12
You have to have the pure science to build up to these levels.
1:22:16
The Andrews is a good example of it for watersheds, and the rotting
1:22:20
tree thing [log decomposition] , and these kinds of things.
1:22:23
When I was here, I really appreciated the Andrews because we were having
1:22:28
trouble figuring out how to handle roadsides, for example, up the
1:22:33
McKenzie, and how best to manage that.
1:22:36
Jerry Franklin and the others over there, I forget the OSU
1:22:42
counterpart to Jerry at that time.
1:22:45
In the '70s?
1:22:46
Yeah, '70s.
1:22:48
And they, you know, they sat down with us.
1:22:51
Dick Waring, probably, right, Richard Waring?
1:22:53
I don't remember that name, but anyway, they sat down with us, went out in the
1:23:01
field with us, and said, "You know, you need to be doing something in these
1:23:08
roadsides or you're going to lose them." We were just protecting them,
1:23:11
not doing anything in there, and they really helped a lot on that.
1:23:15
And Jerry Franklin, he gets a lot of guff from some people,
1:23:20
but he's pretty practical, too.
1:23:21
He's not against logging, he really understands the
1:23:29
ecosystem and what makes it function, and he's just smart enough to know
1:23:35
what we can do to enhance that.
1:23:38
So, we called on him a lot.
1:23:42
And the same way with herbicides.
1:23:45
Give me some specific examples that you remember about
1:23:48
Jerry Franklin's involvement?
1:23:49
Well, the roadside thing was really bugging us.
1:23:54
He spent time with us out there on the ground.
1:23:58
Since then, I've had a chance to deal with him on issues in South
1:24:04
America and various other places.
1:24:07
In fact, developing for OPIC [Overseas Private Investment
1:24:11
Company] an environmental guide, Jerry helped us a lot.
1:24:14
He was up in [Univ.
1:24:15
of] Washington as a professor by that time.
1:24:18
But those are the kind of things that could really help.
1:24:20
Do you want to describe what OPIC is?
1:24:22
It's not OPEC, the oil cartel.
1:24:24
No.
1:24:25
Want to just spell that out for the record?
1:24:26
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which is a U.S. government agency, that
1:24:32
provides political risk insurance and
1:24:38
loans for private investment overseas.
1:24:42
And they don't do that unless there's an environmentally
1:24:44
acceptable plan to do that.
1:24:47
Before we interviewed, you told me about that you went down to
1:24:50
Chile or Patagonia with Jerry.
1:24:53
Do you want to tell me a little about that trip?
1:24:55
Well, that was a case where the Weyerhaeuser Company had a projected
1:25:02
project in Tierra del Fuego, mostly on the Argentine side, but not
1:25:07
entirely, some on the Chile side, too.
1:25:10
And before they could get political risk insurance and grants from the
1:25:15
government overseas, they had to have an environmental assessment by OPIC,
1:25:24
and I was their contractor for that.
1:25:27
Jerry and I just happened to go down together.
1:25:29
And that was very positive because I could bounce things off of him
1:25:34
as a scientist, and he could bounce things off of me as more of a manager.
1:25:40
What was your impressions of the land management dynamics in your
1:25:43
brief experience down there?
1:25:46
The Chileans and the Argentines that you dealt with, and just
1:25:49
what you saw on the land?
1:25:51
I think it was pretty good.
1:25:56
In Argentina, particularly, and then to some extent Chile, they tried to cut
1:26:04
the forest down and have agriculture, grazing, and that sort of thing.
1:26:09
So, that was their choice.
1:26:11
I mean, they didn't make any bones about that.
1:26:13
But then later, as the livestock industry sort of declined, then
1:26:20
they wanted to restore these lands.
1:26:22
And then they also looked at these lands as a timber resource that
1:26:28
could be added to the economy.
1:26:32
So, I really can't fault either one of them for destroying things.
1:26:39
They didn't destroy much of anything.
1:26:41
Well, but if you know U.S. history, you know that what really led to the Forest
1:26:47
Service and the whole conservation ethos in this country and institutions was the
1:26:53
horrible forest practices of the 19th century, especially in the upper Midwest.
1:26:57
Yeah, sure.
1:26:58
Where you had railroad tracks being built in, you know,
1:27:01
basically dead-end railroads.
1:27:03
You cut everything down and leave.
1:27:05
Leave, right.
1:27:06
You know, a lot of that
1:27:11
complete flattening of forests is what eventually would lead to conservation
1:27:17
philosophy discussions and, Pinchot [Gifford] and Graves [Henry] , and the
1:27:22
Forest Service, and Fernow [Bernard] , actually, is the guy I was looking for.
1:27:25
Graves was after Pinchot, but that's true.
1:27:28
Back
1:27:31
to the Andrews.
1:27:34
Tell me more about the science that you saw going on there, and how you
1:27:40
feel that it impacts forest management.
1:27:44
Yeah.
1:27:44
Well, you know, I think the three watersheds [-] , for example, it
1:27:50
was excellent where you clear-cut one, the whole thing, you
1:27:58
had kind of patch-cutting in another one, and nothing in the other.
1:28:01
You had three, these were small watersheds.
1:28:03
You're probably familiar with
1:28:06
those.
1:28:06
Right.
1:28:06
We relied on a lot of stuff that came off of that, and we just didn't understand it.
1:28:14
I hope that we've changed things a bit.
1:28:16
We certainly didn't make giant clear-cuts like in one watershed, yet we
1:28:23
had just the control over here with nothing happening, to measure
1:28:27
what was happening in the roads and scattered timber harvest.
1:28:33
So, that was the main thing going on when I was here.
1:28:37
And except for the incidental stuff and herbicides and helping with the
1:28:44
roadsides and that sort of thing.
1:28:49
Later, since I retired, I use the Andrews regularly.
1:28:53
I take Russian visitors up there.
1:28:55
The people from ELAW, I take up there to show them what's happening in science.
1:29:01
So, you work with Bern Johnson and ELAW then?
1:29:03
Yeah, sure do.
1:29:05
In fact, we, Betty and I both escort people up in that country and agenda.
1:29:15
So, anyway, the blinking means hold [recorder] . Thank you for noticing that.
1:29:21
That's why I'm always looking at the recording device.
1:29:24
[Break in audio]
1:29:25
Now, do you want to continue, we've talked about theoretical science and basic
1:29:30
science, and we took a short break there.
1:29:32
You want to go any more on that point?
1:29:34
I don't think so.
1:29:35
I have a great respect for science.
1:29:38
I don't feel like I'm a scientist, even though I had a lot of technical forestry.
1:29:43
But I know there's people that are working on this and developing new information.
1:29:47
And we need that.
1:29:48
We've got a lot of things in our future here, warming of the world and this
1:29:55
and that, and what the effects are.
1:29:59
So, I think we need all the science we can get.
1:30:03
Now, we talked about Jerry Franklin shortly before the break.
1:30:06
And of course, he's often one of the main people in what they often call "New
1:30:11
Forestry," which is a variety of practices and theories and methods to change the
1:30:20
way business is done going forward.
1:30:24
What's your opinion of New Forestry and what you think it is and how you've
1:30:29
seen it has evolved, good and bad?
1:30:33
Well, I'm a great admirer of Jerry Franklin.
1:30:36
And I endorse his notion of handling timber harvest the way he does.
1:30:45
In fact, I've tried to promote that with OPIC and convince
1:30:52
others that that's the way to go.
1:30:54
So, he's one of my favorite people.
1:30:59
Despite, you know, he and Norm, what's his name?
1:31:03
Norm Johnson.
1:31:04
Norm Johnson and Jerry, they get a lot of criticism, but I think
1:31:09
they have a lot to offer, too.
1:31:12
Jerry, in my view, has been very flexible in trying to keep timber
1:31:18
harvest available, of course, in all kinds of circumstances.
1:31:23
And his sense of leaving a certain number of trees and certain cover
1:31:31
for wildlife and all those things combined are quite good, I think.
1:31:35
You're talking specifically about some of his older ideas, but also ones that
1:31:39
he's now trying to apply along with Norm Johnson in the planning for the O&C lands.
1:31:43
Right?
1:31:44
Sure.
1:31:44
All right.
1:31:52
[Break in audio]
1:31:52
Regarding the science question, we asked it from the other side
1:31:56
from the science perspective.
1:31:58
Now, what are the responsibilities of the land managers as they relate to
1:32:01
important scientific findings, even if they could result in difficult management
1:32:06
challenges and political problems?
1:32:10
Well, part of it's education within the organization and
1:32:15
in the public that you serve.
1:32:16
You know, our motto is "caring for the land and serving the people." If we
1:32:23
know something that promotes caring for the land that is unacceptable
1:32:27
in immediate terms for the people, we're similarly going to have
1:32:31
educate the people, so that we know.
1:32:34
I think we should stand up for that.
1:32:37
I don't have any examples, but I don't think we should ignore
1:32:41
it because we'll be sorry later.
1:32:42
Cite some specific examples if you can remember, where you had to implement
1:32:47
something based on science or something new that flew in the face of something,
1:32:54
Forest Service practice, industry expectations, local communities, that
1:32:59
may have been politically difficult?
1:33:02
Well, I think
1:33:05
probably the thing that comes to my mind is timber harvest in areas that shouldn't
1:33:11
be harvested, but yet, were designated in planning as part of the allowable sell.
1:33:20
Therefore, you've got a dilemma.
1:33:22
If you're not going to do anything in that, you're overcutting the rest of it.
1:33:26
And that's what happened on the Willamette.
1:33:27
In other words, you concentrate in other areas to make up for what
1:33:30
you're not doing somewhere else?
1:33:32
Yeah, but you haven't gone back and changed your capacity or your
1:33:37
capability to do that kind of harvest.
1:33:40
I remember one area on the Rogue River [National Forest] , Union Creek District,
1:33:47
where Dick Worthington and I had to go through Crater Lake National Park and
1:33:51
down to the boundary, and walk into an area that was high elevation Shasta Fir,
1:34:00
and we laid out clear-cuts in there.
1:34:02
And they're still there after 50 years.
1:34:06
Not 50 years, but 35-40 years, they're still not reforested.
1:34:12
They never went and planted?
1:34:13
Well, they planted it, but it didn't
1:34:14
- It just didn't take, huh?
1:34:15
It wouldn't take, no.
1:34:18
I think there's things like that where you know you really shouldn't
1:34:21
be doing it, and so you don't.
1:34:23
And then you're stuck with having to transfer that
1:34:30
production quota into an area that is not capable of adding that much to it.
1:34:37
A lot of that's happened.
1:34:38
And politically, it's just like the Secretary of Agriculture who relieved
1:34:43
me of my duties, he didn't care.
1:34:46
He didn't worry about that.
1:34:48
He just listened to the industry.
1:34:51
And what were you basing your decision on, just your collective experience
1:34:57
of 25 years, 30 years before, or science, for just a gut feeling?
1:35:04
Well, it's probably all of those things.
1:35:06
But I got a lot of feedback from forest supervisors and district rangers
1:35:12
that they just can't continue that.
1:35:14
And I guess that probably caused me to, gave me more ammunition than anything
1:35:20
else, despite what I might think.
1:35:24
If your whole crew, and understand, I had 17 forest supervisors and a
1:35:29
whole bunch of rangers, and they were all saying, we can't do this.
1:35:33
And they know the land a lot better than I do.
1:35:37
Now, how would you describe your environmental ethic
1:35:40
when you started your career?
1:35:45
And then over the next 30-plus years, how it evolved, and even what it is today?
1:35:51
I'd say my environmental awareness was pretty low when I
1:35:55
graduated from forestry school.
1:35:59
I knew how to manage timber and forest and all these things,
1:36:05
grazing, but I just proceeded based on what was happening then.
1:36:09
After Earth Day all these kind of things began to change or altered my feelings
1:36:16
about that, and I think the Forest Service is always a little bit behind.
1:36:21
It usually is, when society changes, where you're not quite ready to change yourself.
1:36:26
Traditional methods, instead of mission.
1:36:30
I probably have more environmental concern today than I ever did.
1:36:33
And I'm
1:36:36
not anti-production by any means, but I'd be much more careful
1:36:44
and concerned about things, and probably seeking more scientific
1:36:48
information or proof or whatever.
1:36:51
And when in doubt, don't do it.
1:36:54
That's kind of my philosophy.
1:36:56
When you first started seeing environmental activism, at
1:37:02
first it kind of came from the Sierra Club and a couple other organizations, then it
1:37:06
became more pluralistic, and it's changed very much in the last 40 years, where it's
1:37:13
incredibly strident and litigious today.
1:37:17
Want to describe how you've seen that change from its, maybe early days, when
1:37:23
some long-haired bearded guy in the '60s, I'm using a stereotype, showed
1:37:28
up and said something, versus as things evolved, Earth Day and afterwards?
1:37:32
Yeah, well, I think you've described it pretty well.
1:37:38
Very well.
1:37:39
Yeah,
1:37:43
when I was supervisor on the Sierra National Forest, I joined the Sierra Club.
1:37:51
Because I really endorsed the basic principle.
1:37:53
And I didn't agree with everything they did, but there's hardly
1:37:56
any organization that I would agree with every aspect of it.
1:37:59
And if anything, I'd like to be able to change some thoughts.
1:38:03
Well, when I came to the Willamette, I kind of dropped my membership
1:38:07
because it was too volatile.
1:38:09
And this was, these were in the years leading up to what was
1:38:12
often called the Forest Wars?
1:38:16
I suppose, I'm not familiar with that.
1:38:18
'70s and '80s.
1:38:18
I mean, the years leading up to the Dwyer injunction on the spotted
1:38:23
owls, and then the planning going up to the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:38:27
Right.
1:38:27
But I mean, this was kind of the ground being prepared for that.
1:38:32
Sure.
1:38:35
You know, I think we learned as we went, but we were a little bit
1:38:39
behind the mainstream of society.
1:38:41
And it's hard to change old ways.
1:38:46
Was it usually the scientists that were more into the changing because they
1:38:50
were doing certain studies of wildlife or plants, and the administrators were
1:38:56
still locked into the old logistics and continuum of how the Forest
1:39:01
Service had done business, or do you think, was there a tension there?
1:39:07
I never felt any tension.
1:39:09
But I think a lot of that exchange and sharing was done by the scientists
1:39:17
and the wildlife biologists, or the scientists and the soil
1:39:21
scientists and the silviculturists.
1:39:24
And you know, one of my classmates became the regional
1:39:28
silviculturist in this region.
1:39:31
And he was good, he had good contacts.
1:39:35
And I encouraged that thing.
1:39:36
In fact, he was our silviculturist here when I was on the Willamette.
1:39:40
And who was that?
1:39:41
Ralph Jaszkowski.
1:39:43
And he developed, I had encouraged him to make sure that we had all the scientific
1:39:50
information that we could, and he was going to be more the judge of whether
1:39:54
it was going to work for us or not.
1:39:56
Because who am I to say anything about silviculture?
1:39:59
I'm a forester, but you know, I did that in the 1950's.
1:40:05
And since then, I did work mostly just as a ranger or something like that.
1:40:10
Now, I'm going to give you a long-range question I was going to ask at the end,
1:40:13
but it's on my mind, so I'll ask you
1:40:17
now.
1:40:18
You have been involved with the Forest Service with your family,
1:40:20
back to the beginning, basically.
1:40:22
A hundred years.
1:40:24
How would you describe the esprit de corps of the Forest Service?
1:40:31
And what it was, what positives that has done for the Forest Service,
1:40:37
both internally and in its image, but also how that's evolved over time?
1:40:43
Yeah.
1:40:43
Or even as some people would say, has declined, the old esprit de corps?
1:40:47
I think the esprit de corps has declined.
1:40:52
There's no question about that, although I'm just amazed at how
1:40:58
competent and willing and professional the people are, especially in
1:41:04
ranger districts and forests.
1:41:07
They know what to do.
1:41:09
And they're still out there working their heads off, despite all the
1:41:14
difficulties and the lack of budget, and
1:41:20
the dissatisfaction by urban people and politicians and so forth.
1:41:26
In my time and earlier, I knew all the elected officials very well
1:41:34
and had a lot of consultation.
1:41:37
That's not happening any more.
1:41:38
In fact, some administrations don't want forest supervisors and regional
1:41:44
foresters talking to members of Congress.
1:41:46
They've come out with that direction.
1:41:49
Well, they still do, but it's all "under cover." So, I think the esprit
1:41:54
de corps has gone down, but it's surprising how resilient people are.
1:41:59
They're still trying to do their job, working extra time and doing good.
1:42:03
And how would you describe the old-school esprit de corps, the stuff you saw
1:42:08
from your father and your grandfather?
1:42:10
And then, even how that was still there when you became
1:42:14
active in the Forest Service?
1:42:15
Yeah, they thought the Forest Service was the greatest thing.
1:42:17
We always referred to ourselves as the Marine Corps of the Civilian Service.
1:42:22
Great, high pride.
1:42:24
And you wore the uniform, the badge, and there's all kinds of
1:42:30
things that are happening now.
1:42:31
The Secretary of Agriculture tried to take our pine tree badge away from us.
1:42:35
He said, "No more of that. You're Department of Agriculture, you're
1:42:39
not Forest Service." Boy, the retirees just went berserk on that.
1:42:44
And
1:42:47
he had to back off it.
1:42:48
But everybody I talked to back there says, "Well, you know, you
1:42:53
won that little battle, but they're going to get even with you." They
1:42:57
took the shield off the pickups, or the green color off the pickups.
1:43:01
Now, they're all white.
1:43:03
Some of them have green stripes like the law enforcement ones and stuff like that.
1:43:07
The fire, wildland fire, the different designations, right.
1:43:07
Yeah,
1:43:10
those are identified.
1:43:11
But the rest of the people drive around in white vehicles with
1:43:14
very little identification.
1:43:15
And that's for, what do you, how do you interpret that?
1:43:20
Well, I interpret it as a kind of a decline in the ability to
1:43:24
project an image, and be proud.
1:43:27
So, you liked that old green?
1:43:30
I didn't care what green it was.
1:43:31
It used to be dark forest green.
1:43:33
That's right.
1:43:34
When did they change to that kind of, whatever it, what was the name of
1:43:38
that green, was there a name for it?
1:43:39
Well, it was a two-tone there for a while.
1:43:41
The white tops and a kind of pale green.
1:43:45
That lasted for a while until they just discontinued everything.
1:43:51
I think there's a lot of resentment on that.
1:43:53
And a lot of feeling, even among the present employees as, you know, why
1:43:57
can't we be proud of ourselves here?
1:44:00
Again, we fly the flag.
1:44:02
And it's hard for them to do it now because these administrations,
1:44:08
not just this one, but all of them
1:44:12
have kind of declined in that respect.
1:44:14
And there's also the last, especially 20-25 years, there's been so much
1:44:22
anti-government rhetoric and kind of a belief in government being the problem,
1:44:30
that the respect for responsible civil servants, whether they're at the Post
1:44:36
Office or wherever, has declined.
1:44:39
Yeah.
1:44:40
I don't see that affecting the Forest Service as much as a
1:44:43
lot of other agencies like IRS
1:44:49
and Justice and this and that.
1:44:51
I think the Forest Service still has a fairly-good image in that respect.
1:44:59
How did you like to deal with the public when you were involved in a
1:45:03
debate, and the whole public involvement thing post-NEPA came on during
1:45:10
the last 18 years of your career.
1:45:14
How would you characterize how you dealt with that, your learning curve
1:45:19
during that time, and how you liked to operate with the public, whether
1:45:24
it be in a one-on-one or a group public hearing type of environment?
1:45:28
I think, first of all, you listen and don't interrupt.
1:45:34
Just listen, make sure you understand, give them all the opportunity if they
1:45:38
want to unload on you or whatever.
1:45:41
And usually after the unloading process, then you can start discussing it.
1:45:46
In my career, I met with large groups and with individuals; I met with everybody.
1:45:53
You know, I always had a great staff.
1:45:56
I didn't have to go making all the decisions or doing all the work.
1:46:00
I could talk to a lot of people.
1:46:01
I considered that my most important thing.
1:46:05
Every time I went back to Washington, which was at least once or twice a month
1:46:09
for various meetings, I always stopped in and see our congressmen, talked to them,
1:46:14
get their feelings about things, make sure they understood why certain things were
1:46:18
done and certain things were not done.
1:46:21
And they could handle part of that problem.
1:46:23
But my office was open, and I took on everybody.
1:46:29
But mainly I listened, and then tried to give feedback
1:46:33
on what we could possibly do.
1:46:35
And I never had any real problems in that respect.
1:46:38
You never had a really-explosive public hearing that you were a part of?
1:46:44
No, not really.
1:46:46
I remember as forest supervisor to the Willamette, we were on Pearl,
1:46:48
13th and --, 11th and Pearl, is
1:46:57
the building there.
1:46:57
It's where our offices were.
1:47:02
This was when French Pete was going, and here comes Jim Weaver,
1:47:09
marching with all these environmentalists.
1:47:12
And they were yelling at me up in the window, "Hey, Zane, come on
1:47:16
down, come on down." You know, I had a good relationship with these
1:47:20
people, even during those periods.
1:47:22
And so, they were going to have a big rally in the mall downtown.
1:47:28
And I went down there.
1:47:29
I joined them and I observed it.
1:47:34
And they had a guy named Zeke something, and he was a logger, with a hickory
1:47:40
shirt and stagged-off black pants and cork coots, and he had a chainsaw.
1:47:45
And he was up there with the environmentalists.
1:47:47
He was wearing corks in town?
1:47:48
Yeah, right.
1:47:52
So, you could hear him, click, click, click, click, right?
1:47:54
Yeah, so, and I forget the young man's name, who is now a lawyer, but
1:48:00
anyway, he was introducing everybody.
1:48:03
And he says, "Now we're going to play a little game." He says, "All you people
1:48:07
out there standing, you're trees.
1:48:11
And you're standing there proud and be the forest." And he says, "What
1:48:15
do you think, Zeke?" And old Zeke looks around and he, vroom, vroom!
1:48:20
And then he starts his chainsaw out there and he goes, bzzzz!
1:48:26
And everybody fell down.
1:48:26
[Laughs] Well, you know, it was more good-hearted, but it made a point.
1:48:33
Somewhat of a publicity stunt.
1:48:36
Yes.
1:48:37
Well, yes, let them do that.
1:48:39
And you know, I was there, and I still talked to them.
1:48:44
But I never had anybody that just refused to deal with
1:48:52
me.
1:48:52
Tell me about some of your important mentors, role models, friends, colleagues,
1:49:00
in the Forest Service that you have not talked about, since we've been
1:49:03
mainly talking about general stations and dynamics and management issues.
1:49:08
But tell me about some of the people in your Forest Service life and career?
1:49:12
Yeah, I think particularly during my generation and in the past, my dad and
1:49:19
grandfather, we did have strong mentors.
1:49:23
As I said before, I never applied for a job in the Forest Service.
1:49:30
When there was opening, I didn't apply, I was always selected by whoever
1:49:36
it was that selected those things.
1:49:39
Annually, we'd have performance ratings and we'd talk about where we wanted
1:49:44
to go and what we might do better, or what we were doing very well,
1:49:48
but I never had to apply for a job.
1:49:52
I was always selected.
1:49:54
And I know I had some strong mentors.
1:49:58
Vern Hamre, who was my boss back in Washington, D.C. He was a strong mentor.
1:50:06
Jack Deinema, who was a regional forester in San Francisco at
1:50:10
one time, a strong mentor.
1:50:15
Several people I know and some I probably didn't know, were strong mentors.
1:50:22
And my dad was a mentor to quite a few of my contemporaries that I know, and
1:50:31
I've visited with them about that, too.
1:50:34
Are you Zane Jr., by the way?
1:50:36
Yeah, correct.
1:50:36
Okay.
1:50:38
And my granddad mentored certain people.
1:50:41
So, I think there was a strong mentoring system.
1:50:45
I think when we, somewhere in the '70s and '80s, that probably began to decline a bit
1:50:51
because everything was so structured in terms of filling vacancies and promotions.
1:50:58
If you didn't apply, you weren't considered.
1:51:02
Now, that didn't mean that a ranger or a forest supervisor might say, "You know,
1:51:07
Joe, why don't you apply for that? I think you'd be great." But they had to apply.
1:51:15
There's also more and more families were unwilling to move.
1:51:22
Wives had jobs.
1:51:23
So, the old dynamic of the military model of
1:51:27
-- It began to decline.
1:51:27
The model of many stations in so many years; that started to decline?
1:51:28
Yeah.
1:51:34
And now you've got people not clustered into compounds, ranger stations are
1:51:41
kind of scattered around, and they don't get together as much anymore.
1:51:46
So, there's been a decline on that.
1:51:49
And you can't fix that really, you just have to deal with it and manage it.
1:51:56
But it's different.
1:51:57
And I certainly had a lot of mentors.
1:51:59
And without those mentors, I would not have gotten where I was, because
1:52:06
I was a district ranger an unbelievably short time, and a forest
1:52:11
supervisor an unbelievably short time, and a regional forester, which
1:52:15
hardly anybody ever gets there.
1:52:20
So, how would you describe the reason of how you went up
1:52:25
the ladder fairly-quick?
1:52:27
Well, I think, for one thing, I understood the Forest Service.
1:52:31
And knew how to make the best of it.
1:52:35
I was willing to move and Betty, my wife, she learned to move,
1:52:41
and has, many, many times.
1:52:45
So, we always hated to leave in some ways, but I never turned down a
1:52:50
promotion, or a reassignment because I knew that was important to do.
1:52:56
Of course, it was probably more difficult on your children.
1:53:00
Our son
1:53:02
probably went to the same school, maybe two years at a time, never went again.
1:53:11
Our daughter is a little more stable.
1:53:14
But Tim, he went to
1:53:21
Kennedy Middle School here one year, and two years to Churchill [both
1:53:28
in Eugene] , and then, he went to Washington, D.C. two years there.
1:53:32
Those are pretty-tough moves.
1:53:35
He didn't have any trouble with it.
1:53:37
Especially in adolescence, when you're coming of age and, you
1:53:40
know, who am I going to go to a prom with, that kind of thing?
1:53:43
Yeah, well, I think, all the moves really helped him.
1:53:47
Now, he's the District Manager for BLM in Las Vegas, for all of southern Nevada.
1:53:53
Really?
1:53:54
Yeah, and he just handled the Bodie thing.
1:53:59
What happened at Bodie?
1:54:00
[Thought he meant old mining town in eastern California.] This is off the
1:54:00
subject, but I'd be interested, tell me?
1:54:03
Mr. Bodie?
1:54:04
Oh, no, you're talking about Bundy [Cliven]
1:54:09
. Bundy, Bundy, yes.
1:54:10
The reason is, Bodie's the famous ghost town.
1:54:14
Anyway, I was confused.
1:54:15
What happened in "Bodie," as I was just there?
1:54:19
Excuse me.
1:54:20
Yes, Bundy.
1:54:21
And Tim's handled that very well, too.
1:54:26
How did he deal with that?
1:54:30
First of all, that was a 20-year-old problem, and he'd just been down there for
1:54:34
a year, and the secretary [of Interior] handed it to him to solve, get it done,
1:54:40
so he did.
1:54:40
And he began to gather up all the cows and do the thing he was supposed to do.
1:54:46
And that's when Mr. Bodie
1:54:49
-- Bundy.
1:54:50
Bundy.
1:54:51
Cliven Bundy.
1:54:53
Mr. Bundy gathered up his horses.
1:54:57
And the BLM and the Forest -- , or the BLM and the Park Service, had 100 armed law
1:55:05
enforcement people there to protect the wranglers and make sure everything worked.
1:55:11
They had a kind of headquarters
1:55:15
there with trailers.
1:55:15
But Bundy had a bunch of militia guys there, too?
1:55:17
Yeah, 200.
1:55:18
Two hundred, and a lot of them had AK-47's.
1:55:22
And they lined women and children up in front of them and pointed the
1:55:26
guns at the BLM and Park Service.
1:55:28
Tim called the whole thing off.
1:55:32
It wasn't worth the chance, the risk.
1:55:35
But he said, "Don't take a shot at anything, because it would be a
1:55:38
massacre." And so, what he did was, he called on the Metro Police [Las Vegas]
1:55:45
and the Las Vegas Sheriff's Office, and they brought their SWAT teams in, and
1:55:50
escorted the BLM and Park Service off.
1:55:53
And then it was turned over.
1:55:55
Fortunately, the Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, she turned
1:56:01
it over to the Attorney General [U.S] , and the Attorney General
1:56:03
got the U.S. Marshals and the FBI in, just for, they'll arrest Bundy.
1:56:12
Did they finally arrest him?
1:56:13
No, I don't think it's done yet, but that's their intent is to
1:56:16
arrest him and put him in jail.
1:56:19
Okay.
1:56:20
I think when you get into a real confrontation and you
1:56:27
have to stand your ground, if it's a law, but if somebody is not happy with
1:56:35
a law, you could take somebody like Mr. Bundy and the Nevada situation.
1:56:42
I have some sympathy for the fact that Nevada is 87 percent publicly owned.
1:56:48
But taking the law, or going against the law, is not the way to handle it.
1:56:54
Somehow, there needs to be some legislation or some legal way to resolve
1:57:00
that issue, if it should be resolved.
1:57:03
But it really has to do with education.
1:57:05
Because if most people realized that the actual market price of grazing land, for
1:57:12
instance, and the fees that they pay, and this even goes back to the early Forest
1:57:19
Service days that your grandpa and your father dealt with, when there was early
1:57:22
resistance to any management whatsoever, the market prices would be much more.
1:57:28
Yes.
1:57:29
But people, they have, I think, a distorted view of "John Wayne"
1:57:35
independence and mythology, as I call it, and what really is true on the ground,
1:57:41
versus what their views of things are.
1:57:45
Well, it's been said that grazing fees are so low, and they are low.
1:57:50
However, nobody ever recognizes that the ranchers under the permits are required
1:57:56
to document certain improvements.
1:57:58
Usually water and throughways.
1:57:59
And water and fences
1:58:03
and total management of those areas.
1:58:06
So, you might say that in the private sector, you might get $10 per cow
1:58:11
or calf a month, on the public lands, you get $1.35 or something
1:58:17
like that per cow or calf-month.
1:58:20
But there's a lot of other requirements that are contributing
1:58:24
to the welfare of the land.
1:58:27
Did you ever have any less publicized versions of that in the many different
1:58:35
issues that you dealt with out there, whether it had to do with a squatter
1:58:39
on a mining claim, illegal grazing, illegal timber cutting; did you have any
1:58:44
instances like that in all your years?
1:58:46
We had instances of trespass, people stealing timber, Christmas trees,
1:58:53
keeping too many cows on a permit.
1:58:57
But we dealt with them in the regular manner.
1:59:00
And how would you describe the regular manner?
1:59:04
Well, the regular manner was to get our law enforcement people involved
1:59:08
and then take them to court, and we had pretty good relationships with
1:59:13
all the magistrates in our areas.
1:59:16
They'd fine the people or put them in jail.
1:59:19
And if it was really serious, then it got into the big-time
1:59:23
in jail, those sort of things.
1:59:24
And then, we have sent people to jail, particularly on timber trespass
1:59:29
where it was, you know, purposeful.
1:59:31
For instance, give me a for-example?
1:59:33
Well, I think in almost every assignment I had, there was examples of it.
1:59:40
I don't remember names of the people.
1:59:41
That isn't important, but how would you describe what would
1:59:45
happen in a typical situation?
1:59:46
Well, there might be a private/public boundary.
1:59:51
And they do their private land, and then, they'd cut into the
1:59:55
national forest and think they'd get away with it, or they just simply
1:59:59
-- And then they'd feign ignorance after-the-fact?
2:00:02
Yeah, after-the-fact, and then we'd have to prove it.
2:00:05
And then people stealing Christmas trees, you know, by
2:00:10
taking 300-400 Christmas trees.
2:00:12
Oh, not just one for the family living room.
2:00:15
We give them permits on that, but so that people don't have to worry about that.
2:00:20
But yeah, I think there's been a lot of trespass and illegal stuff,
2:00:26
and there's people who start fires.
2:00:29
We've got a good law enforcement group that works with us as part of
2:00:34
district ranger's teams and they go out there and figure those things out.
2:00:38
And then they cooperate with the Sheriff's office, too.
2:00:41
The Sisk Act back in the
2:00:47
'60s allows the Forest Service to cooperate with sheriff's
2:00:50
departments, giving them money and they help us with law enforcement.
2:00:54
And we don't have exclusive jurisdiction of the national forests, the sheriff and
2:01:01
us share that, unlike the Park Service.
2:01:04
The state police, they also can be involved, if you're asked in, right?
2:01:08
Yeah, right.
2:01:08
They're not real anxious to do this because they're short of budget, too, so,
2:01:13
but the sheriffs are good cooperators.
2:01:17
And they also had the search and rescue people and the abilities to go out
2:01:21
into areas like that more than most.
2:01:23
Yes, absolutely.
2:01:25
And the infrastructure in specific areas for doing such things.
2:01:28
Search and rescues are done by volunteers.
2:01:30
But they're usually coordinated through sheriff departments, generally.
2:01:33
Yeah, sheriff's departments organize it.
2:01:36
Right, right.
2:01:40
Did you have a favorite station or job?
2:01:47
District Ranger on the Okanagan National Forest.
2:01:51
Why?
2:01:52
My wife liked that, too.
2:01:53
It's just Okanagan is such a great town.
2:01:56
It was a nice forest.
2:01:58
It was,
2:02:03
district ranger is the best job in the Forest Service, at least at that time it
2:02:07
was, and I think it still probably is.
2:02:09
You're the leader, but you're still close to the ground.
2:02:13
And you're on horseback a lot.
2:02:16
You're out in the field a lot.
2:02:18
You've got, you're usually, at least in our time, you were part
2:02:23
of a community, and well-respected.
2:02:26
So, both Betty and I feel that Okanagan was the best.
2:02:29
And at
2:02:31
that time, that was the longest we've ever stayed in one place, four years.
2:02:35
And that was in the early '60s, right?
2:02:36
That was in, yeah, '61 through, up to '65.
2:02:37
So that was the best.
2:02:46
But
2:02:49
they were all good.
2:02:51
Two tours in Washington, D.C., as long as I felt I wasn't going to have
2:02:56
to stay there forever, it was fun.
2:03:00
Now, do you still have friends in some of these remote postings?
2:03:03
Yeah, we do.
2:03:05
We do.
2:03:05
So, when you travel, you often say, "Hello, from long ago."
2:03:11
Yeah, right.
2:03:12
Well, we get to Okanagan once in a while,
2:03:17
and our next-door neighbor, Margaret Shallow, she ran the
2:03:22
men's clothing store there and we visited her in the retirement home.
2:03:27
There's just all kinds of places like that.
2:03:33
And of course, the Forest Service during our era was pretty tight-knit and we've
2:03:39
got friends all over the United States.
2:03:43
So, they're disappearing, though.
2:03:49
It's really-difficult for us to see our people go.
2:03:54
Yeah.
2:03:54
Now,
2:03:57
I'd say the number one Gifford Pinchot-ism and paradigm of the
2:04:01
Forest Service is multiple-use, and its partner, sustained-yield.
2:04:04
Well, yeah.
2:04:07
And maybe you want to add one?
2:04:10
Well, his long-term motto was, in the long term
2:04:18
-- "Greatest good for the greatest number."
2:04:19
Greatest good, yeah.
2:04:20
But I mean, but that's the over-arching utilitarianism.
2:04:23
Yeah, right.
2:04:23
That he placed those specifics, the multiple-use, sustained-yield, within.
2:04:27
How have you seen those change?
2:04:31
How did you understand that when you started and how do you
2:04:35
understand it now in retirement?
2:04:39
Well, I think it's still the greatest good for the greatest number in the long-run,
2:04:43
which is, I think, still a valid one.
2:04:46
How you apply that is something else.
2:04:48
And now, what is the greatest good?
2:04:50
And what is the long run?
2:04:53
But it would be good if we could get members of Congress and others in
2:04:58
these groups that are interested in the Forest Service to endorse that,
2:05:03
and test their position that way.
2:05:05
And the Forest Service should test itself that way, too.
2:05:14
You know, I think it's still there, but I think it gets lost in the
2:05:18
urbanization of this country.
2:05:20
Yeah, I think the urban/rural bifurcation of demographics and culture is part
2:05:27
of some of the things that you are discussing in other ways about the
2:05:30
separation, the lack of connections that you used to have before.
2:05:35
I think that's just a broad dynamic that affects everything.
2:05:39
I think so.
2:05:40
Now, taking the multiple-use concept, greatest good for
2:05:43
greatest number, overseas.
2:05:46
You've done some work overseas, mostly at the end of your career but also some
2:05:52
related things in retirement, correct?
2:05:54
You want to describe how you see that extending beyond the confines of the U.S.?
2:05:58
Right.
2:05:59
Well, I think most of my overseas work had to do with either sustainable development
2:06:05
planning, or environmental assessments on how to protect the ecosystem and
2:06:13
viability of the land and resource.
2:06:18
I spent quite a bit of time
2:06:23
with Ecologically Sustainable Development, Inc., working with
2:06:29
Russians, Mongolians, and Chinese on sustainable development plans
2:06:38
as advisors to their scientists and managers, and deciding what
2:06:46
would be best for them in terms of
2:06:51
land allocations to commercial harvest or watershed forest, or grazing or
2:07:01
settlement development, that kind of thing, fisheries and wildlife, wilderness,
2:07:08
all the way to World Heritage sites.
2:07:11
That, I think, was really-important.
2:07:15
And it extended this notion of the greatest good.
2:07:22
You've got to decide what
2:07:26
your priorities are.
2:07:28
You can't impose them on the Russians or anybody else.
2:07:31
They've got to understand what is it that's important to them, as long as
2:07:36
it doesn't, well, you know, violate the integrity of the ecosystems and your
2:07:43
natural resources, and you can help them.
2:07:46
So, I did a lot of that.
2:07:47
I did about 12 years' worth of that.
2:07:50
We planned the entire Lake Baikal Basin, which is an area the size
2:07:55
of California and Oregon combined.
2:07:57
Well, and Lake Baikal, of course, is the deepest lake in the world.
2:08:00
The deepest lake and it holds more water than all the Great Lakes
2:08:05
in the United States together.
2:08:06
Well, it's almost 6,000 feet deep.
2:08:08
Well, yeah, it's over a mile deep.
2:08:11
And fresh water seals, and endemic fish, and you know, it's one of
2:08:15
the clearest lakes in the world.
2:08:17
So, there hasn't been any serious pollution that's gone on in
2:08:22
the area that's damaged the watershed and the lake itself?
2:08:26
It hasn't really made a huge difference.
2:08:29
Now, there's been polluters.
2:08:30
There's a pulp mill right on it.
2:08:33
And they go dumping their stuff right into it.
2:08:36
But the solution to pollution is dilution, you know.
2:08:40
That's a big lake.
2:08:41
That's a big lake, so you can go a long time without anything happening there.
2:08:46
But half of that was in Mongolia and half of it was in Russia.
2:08:52
So, that was one project.
2:08:54
We also did the Ussuri in China and the far east of Russia.
2:08:58
And then we did the Altai Republic, the entire republic, which is
2:09:02
a republic of Russia, on the very southwest part of Siberia.
2:09:11
So, all of that was going on in terms of planning.
2:09:16
Then environmental assessments with OPIC and others, just to make
2:09:22
sure that things were done right without damaging the resource.
2:09:29
We made some real progress on that.
2:09:34
Well, that's some of the examples overseas, too, with the American Forest,
2:09:42
we had a project called Trees for Tigers, and the Siberian Tiger was endangered.
2:09:50
The white tiger, right?
2:09:52
It's not white.
2:09:53
It's just a regular black-and-white stripe.
2:09:56
Oh, I'm thinking of the white snow leopard.
2:09:57
Snow leopard.
2:09:57
Okay, my confusion.
2:09:59
Yeah, we had snow leopards in southern Siberia and in Mongolia,
2:10:04
but the Siberian Tiger is the biggest tiger of the five species.
2:10:08
And
2:10:11
there's only about 500 of them left.
2:10:13
Their habitat was being swallowed up.
2:10:16
Other people were dealing with poaching and that sort of thing,
2:10:19
but we dealt with the habitat.
2:10:21
And worked with the Forest Service of the Primorski Kray, and Kray
2:10:32
is kind of like a state, and the Amur
2:10:37
Oblast, which is another thing for state.
2:10:42
And planted Korean Pine which was native to that area, and provided a
2:10:48
mast for the prey, for the tigers.
2:10:51
And we spent, we had a huge grant from Exxon-Mobil, a "tiger
2:10:58
in your tank" guy, you know.
2:11:01
They were interested in it until a terrorist attack and we lost our funding.
2:11:05
But we did a lot of work there.
2:11:07
And did some work in Indonesia with the mangrove.
2:11:13
This is American Forest stuff now.
2:11:16
Those were all important things.
2:11:17
Another thing I did with American Forest was I led a People-To-People
2:11:23
visit to China.
2:11:24
This is the Eisenhower People-To-People program.
2:11:28
And we had about 20 foresters that went over there and we did a lot
2:11:34
of visitation with the science sections of China [government] , and
2:11:40
then, their management sections.
2:11:43
So, all those things were kind of important and
2:11:47
sort of edge up to dealing with whole idea
2:11:54
of the greatest good, etc., etc.
2:11:55
What do you see as the greatest challenges for some of these, let's
2:11:58
say, a typical developing country?
2:12:01
You know, and Indonesia being one of the most geographically
2:12:04
disparate countries, if not the most disparate in the word because of
2:12:08
how many hundreds of islands it has.
2:12:10
What are their challenges in terms of applying sustainable practices with the
2:12:15
population pressures and the dispersed government authorities and infrastructure?
2:12:23
Trying to hold the line against countries that export their resources,
2:12:28
including the United States.
2:12:30
See, when we tie up our timber resources, they go someplace.
2:12:37
So, that plus China and Japan, whose resources are very limited and offer
2:12:46
economic incentives for those countries to exploit their natural resources.
2:12:52
And that's a huge problem.
2:12:55
Brazil has had some issues there, and South America, in various places.
2:13:00
And there's too much incentive to improve the welfare and economics of the people
2:13:07
in the short run, rather than the long run, you know, reserving those terribly
2:13:14
important ecosystems, particularly, the jungles of the temperate tropical forest.
2:13:30
When was the first time you heard the term ecology?
2:13:34
Ecology?
2:13:34
To
2:13:36
the best of your recollection?
2:13:39
I think I probably heard it in school in the '50s, but where it became a
2:13:47
real tangible thing that we dealt with, probably in the '60s, somewhere in there.
2:13:53
What did the term mean to you then, and what does it mean now?
2:14:01
Ecology was just the understanding of nature, of natural resources,
2:14:07
combinations of forest, grass, birds, everything, the ecology.
2:14:14
It's not a term I use a whole lot.
2:14:20
It still kind of means the same thing to me.
2:14:23
Did you see that term or those kind of things make some of the old-school people
2:14:31
bristle or become uncomfortable, thinking it was, one of those "green" words?
2:14:37
There probably was some of that because the environmentalists were
2:14:40
using that term more, but I think most people understood what it was about.
2:14:48
How they dealt with it in terms of
2:14:53
living with the ecological systems, was quite different, probably.
2:15:00
Now, how did you view ecosystem science when you first heard about what it was,
2:15:06
whether through the Andrews or somewhere else, and how do you view it today?
2:15:10
And of course, you've told me you've had many more interactions with the Andrews
2:15:14
in your retirement, and I'm going to want you to talk about some of those, too.
2:15:17
But start with just the definitional aspect of it, what ecosystems
2:15:22
science meant to you when you first heard and understood what
2:15:25
it was, and how you see it today?
2:15:28
Well, I think always that ecosystems indicated a subset of definitions
2:15:35
about how you draw circles around them.
2:15:40
We used it in RARE II, trying to get representation of all ecosystems into
2:15:48
the wilderness system as a kind of a given comparing with the outside.
2:15:57
You can define that in any way you want.
2:16:00
You can measure landscapes and cultivation with vegetation.
2:16:04
Your house and yard are an ecosystem, for example.
2:16:08
Yeah, right.
2:16:09
Right.
2:16:09
So, you know, I don't think too much about that.
2:16:13
And I think I understand that is probably applied in different ways in different
2:16:20
circumstances, like the house or the yard, compared to the landscapes in
2:16:29
northern Arizona, something like that.
2:16:32
Now, what was the first experimental forest or research natural area
2:16:37
that you remember being exposed to?
2:16:40
Was it the Andrews or were there other ones as you went
2:16:42
around the West in your career?
2:16:48
I can't think of
2:16:53
the real sequence of it.
2:16:55
But almost everywhere I've been, there's been research.
2:17:02
It wouldn't necessarily be a whole experimental forest like
2:17:08
the Andrews, but watersheds.
2:17:11
For example, there's a lot of watershed stuff I've experienced
2:17:15
in the state of Washington.
2:17:18
Even in Washington, D.C. and traveling through the New England
2:17:24
area, New Hampshire and Vermont.
2:17:28
There's Hubbard Brook up there.
2:17:29
Yeah, and I knew even growing up, I knew about research stations.
2:17:38
There's the Wind River up, of course, up in Washington.
2:17:40
Did you ever go there when you were stationed in Gifford
2:17:43
Pinchot [National Forest]
2:17:45
? Well, I was at Cispus Job Corps then, so I didn't do much outside of that.
2:17:52
But I'd been to Wind River before.
2:17:55
And I've been to a lot of them, I guess.
2:17:57
And, you know, my colleagues in the Forest Service as a regional
2:18:03
forester were the station directors.
2:18:06
I got to know them as well, as I knew other regional foresters, and we
2:18:11
had a lot of interaction with them.
2:18:15
So, I don't have a lot of memory of those instances, but
2:18:21
it's been a part of my life.
2:18:23
You know, my grandfather was a good friend of research people, and I even
2:18:29
knew them, and I was aware of research.
2:18:33
And not so much experimental forests and such, but various things that happened.
2:18:42
Now, you got to know Jerry Franklin later in your career.
2:18:45
Correct?
2:18:45
I had met him here in the '70s.
2:18:47
Yeah, '70s.
2:18:49
So, you must have been exposed to the Andrews, personally.
2:18:54
Oh, yeah.
2:18:56
Tell me about how you remember the first time you went there?
2:19:02
Well, I'm sure it was the first year I was here on the Willamette
2:19:06
National Forest, though the Blue River Ranger District, which at
2:19:10
that time, had a coordinator/liaison with the station and the
2:19:20
forest.
2:19:21
And I was up there several times.
2:19:24
What do you remember about your impressions of the place?
2:19:28
The infrastructure, the science, the projects, or the lack of infrastructure?
2:19:35
Yeah.
2:19:36
I never had any problem with infrastructure.
2:19:39
I mean, that was their business.
2:19:40
And all I was
2:19:41
-- I mean, just what you remembered about it.
2:19:43
I'm not saying
2:19:44
-- Yeah.
2:19:45
I was more concerned about information that I could get,
2:19:52
advice and counsel I could get.
2:19:54
And I got all I wanted.
2:19:55
And what do you remember the really,
2:20:01
the most important things that you got out of that place when you first went here?
2:20:09
Well, the important thing was realizing there was a source
2:20:12
of information and advice.
2:20:15
And I used that quite a bit.
2:20:17
But I didn't get involved in their projects.
2:20:21
I observed some of them, like the rotting log thing and the watershed work they
2:20:30
did, and I got very familiar with that.
2:20:32
What was your impression of the; actually, it's called the Long-Term
2:20:36
Log Decomposition Experiment?
2:20:38
Oh, I thought it was a fascinating, 200-year thing.
2:20:40
Right, and Mark Harmon was actually a grad student of Jerry Franklin.
2:20:45
Was he?
2:20:45
That's kind of become his baby [Harmon]
2:20:47
. Yeah.
2:20:48
But what was your impression when you first heard 200 years?
2:20:51
I mean, what was your impression about that time-span, which you
2:20:58
might say redefines scientific studies and what an era would be?
2:21:04
I think I was probably a little bit awed by that, and never
2:21:09
heard anything quite like that.
2:21:10
But I had no problem with it.
2:21:13
I thought it was a great idea.
2:21:15
And the other things that they did up in the canopies, all
2:21:19
of those things, were good.
2:21:23
Mainly, if I had anything I wanted advice on, that's where I went, at first.
2:21:29
And of course, you had
2:21:33
at that time, the lead guy was Jerry Franklin.
2:21:36
Yeah.
2:21:37
But I also dealt directly with the station director.
2:21:40
Art McKee?
2:21:40
[H.J. Andrews E.F. Site Director]
2:21:40
Well
2:21:40
-- Oh, you're talking about the PNW Station director?
2:21:42
Yeah, right.
2:21:42
Art McKee, I
2:21:49
knew.
2:21:49
Yeah, my fault.
2:21:51
But I think it was Bob Buckman [PNW Station Director] was
2:21:55
there at one time up there.
2:21:56
But we dealt with all these people.
2:22:00
And it wasn't always just the Andrews, but it was any place that was into research.
2:22:07
Now, the log decomp experiment is obviously one that flew in
2:22:12
the face of previous beliefs about dead stuff in forests.
2:22:17
How did you look at dead material or dying material in forests when you first
2:22:21
came in, and did you start to change your mind before you heard about that study,
2:22:28
or was that really revolutionary for you when they explained what they were doing?
2:22:32
I think it reinforced the idea that decaying wood is good for the ecosystem.
2:22:38
Because before that, earlier in my career, when we had a timber sale,
2:22:43
we just gathered all the slash or broadcast burned it, and cleaned it up.
2:22:51
I think we changed a lot and that was revealing that it's good to, it
2:22:57
took a long time for that thing to catch on, because they were still
2:23:02
broadcast burning clear into the '70s.
2:23:05
[Clock chimes] And
2:23:08
piling and burning.
2:23:12
Basically, the nutrients and all that carbon and what
2:23:15
have you, just would go up.
2:23:20
And you know, it's habitat for critters and there's all kinds of reasons why
2:23:25
you don't want to just clean things, strip it, you know, clean it up.
2:23:34
What were some of the other people that you met up there that you recall?
2:23:38
You know
2:23:39
-- Or people that you still, or people that you know now, too?
2:23:41
Yeah,
2:23:43
well, Fred Swanson.
2:23:47
Talk to me about Fred, because although he's now technically
2:23:52
retired, he's not really retired.
2:23:55
He continues to take a very active role in shepherding the whole Andrews program,
2:24:02
which is including humanities and social sciences and a variety of things, as well
2:24:07
as the legacy issues which he's partly responsible for, including this project.
2:24:12
Tell me about Fred?
2:24:13
Well, I thought Fred was a very approachable and available person.
2:24:19
You could talk to him any time.
2:24:21
He was particularly expert in explaining things in terms that a non-scientist
2:24:31
could understand, and he was willing to present things in a manner that would
2:24:37
help you with what you were concerned about, how you might go about things.
2:24:42
He's just a great guy.
2:24:45
It's been a long time since I've really dealt with any of that stuff,
2:24:50
and he was one of my favorites.
2:24:53
I had
2:24:55
pretty much constant contact with him, not every day, but there's
2:25:00
never a time you were neglected by him when you'd have an issue.
2:25:07
Any other people at the Andrews over the years, the streams people,
2:25:11
for instance, Stan Gregory or
2:25:13
- ? Stan Gregory, I know him.
2:25:15
I know lot of those guys, although I can't remember their
2:25:17
names, but I knew who they are.
2:25:19
But the whole crew there was fine.
2:25:24
Now, you have been up there quite a bit since you retired?
2:25:28
I was up there about a week ago.
2:25:30
Describe the evolution of the place?
2:25:33
And I mean, you said the infrastructure wasn't a problem when you were
2:25:38
younger, because actually there wasn't any, really, to speak of,
2:25:41
and now what you see up there.
2:25:42
How do you feel that change and that evolution?
2:25:45
Well, the facility and the headquarters is completely different.
2:25:52
It's great.
2:25:54
All those apartments and the
2:25:58
laboratory and the classrooms, and you know, even a USGS mudslide thing
2:26:07
[measure debris flows] . I took Betty up there again, I guess, last weekend.
2:26:13
We spent a whole day in the McKenzie, went up to Lookout
2:26:19
Creek and hiked up a trail there.
2:26:22
You go up the "Old Growth Trail"?
2:26:26
[Andrews Forest]
2:26:27
No, I didn't go up there.
2:26:29
But Betty's got so much arthritis and knee problems, I can't do much of that.
2:26:33
But anyway, any time I get Russians or Chinese or, whoever,
2:26:40
in here, to take them up for
2:26:48
ELAW.
2:26:48
I've had Panamanians, I've had Europeans, all kinds of people,
2:26:49
and I always take them up there.
2:26:51
And the staff there's very accommodating, but if they're not available if
2:26:56
it's on a weekend or something, I just take them up there myself.
2:26:59
And they are just astounded.
2:27:02
It's a great place.
2:27:03
What astounds them?
2:27:05
Well, first of all, just to get into some of those old-growth stands,
2:27:10
and see a facility like that.
2:27:15
And I forget the gal's name that took us through all those apartments and
2:27:19
everything, but I was just amazed.
2:27:19
We used to have just trailers and broken-down buildings
2:27:25
up there, when I was there.
2:27:27
You know, the name for it in the old days, don't you?
2:27:30
No.
2:27:31
The "Ghetto in the Meadow."
2:27:33
[Laughs] I've heard that.
2:27:34
That's how they described it for many years.
2:27:36
Yeah.
2:27:37
And there were infamous incidents of rodents, and the one time, and I
2:27:41
can't remember who it was, when some scientist, the shower basically went
2:27:46
through the floor of the trailer.
2:27:49
He was okay, but still.
2:27:51
Yeah, yeah.
2:27:52
That's really great to see that.
2:27:55
I'm very proud of it for the Forest Service and the university [OSU] . And
2:28:00
you know, the relationship between OSU and the Forest Service is excellent there.
2:28:04
Yeah, that's one of the capstone questions to ask is, the inter-institutional
2:28:11
cooperation between OSU and the U.S. Forest Service has been central
2:28:17
to the success of the Andrews.
2:28:19
And why do you think that happened there like that, because that is not
2:28:24
always the case that this happens?
2:28:27
It's not the case, but the Andrews is sort of a special place, even
2:28:32
among all experimental forests.
2:28:36
OSU has got a forestry school and it's agriculture-oriented,
2:28:44
and the station has a presence there, the Forest Service station.
2:28:50
The National Forest here, Willamette's got involved, and we have a coordinator
2:28:56
[liaison] that works with them.
2:28:58
So, I think it's sort of a unique situation.
2:29:02
And I don't know why it isn't more common, and maybe there's just not those
2:29:08
commonalities in terms of presence.
2:29:12
So, what's your knowledge of the LTER system?
2:29:16
I don't even know what LTER stands for.
2:29:17
Okay,
2:29:20
it's Long-Term Ecological Research.
2:29:22
Yeah, I don't know much about that.
2:29:24
I saw that in your write-up here.
2:29:25
Yeah, there's 27 of them in North America, the Arctic and Antarctica.
2:29:31
Okay.
2:29:31
And so, but that's what it is.
2:29:40
Anyway, tell me a little more about what your experiences with the Andrews
2:29:44
have been in retirement and things that you've seen go on up there?
2:29:49
Well, I think it's mainly taking international people up there and other
2:29:55
people that are interested in forestry and not familiar with this area.
2:30:01
I go up there with almost any guest and visitor.
2:30:05
And I try to let them know I'm coming.
2:30:07
But if, you know, I'm not asking for any help.
2:30:11
Because most of these people, just knowing it's there and it
2:30:17
happens is about two-thirds of it.
2:30:19
And they're not going to come away with a lot scientific questions,
2:30:24
although some of the foreigners do.
2:30:28
So, that's about the bulk of it.
2:30:31
I enjoy going up there myself and just wandering around.
2:30:36
Okay, you were going to tell me some things about some items on your
2:30:43
list that you wanted to address?
2:30:44
Well, after retirement, besides 25 years with the American Forest as a volunteer
2:30:52
and all the things that we did, the Trees for Tigers, and Mangroves, and Indonesia,
2:31:00
just representing them in the Northwest.
2:31:02
And then the Ecologically Sustainable Development, I
2:31:07
spent about 12 years with them.
2:31:08
I spent all that time in Russia, Mongolia, and China, and South America.
2:31:15
Then in Oregon, I was appointed to the Recreation Trails Advisory Council.
2:31:22
I spent about three or four years there, just a council that dealt
2:31:28
with the allocation of funds for trails, recreation trails.
2:31:34
And then, I was appointed to the
2:31:40
Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board.
2:31:44
I spent about three years there.
2:31:48
And they, basically, take all these grant monies that come from the
2:31:54
federal level and some other places, to improve watersheds and protect them.
2:32:01
And then nine years with that commission.
2:32:04
The Wildlife Commission?
2:32:06
The Fish and Wildlife Commission, yeah.
2:32:08
I signed up for a four-year term and ended up with nine years.
2:32:13
And those are good experiences because I learned a lot, plus I think
2:32:19
they needed somebody that would, was helpful with the public lands.
2:32:27
And we really got the Forest Service and the BLM and Park Service working with
2:32:34
the state of Oregon in those instances.
2:32:37
A question related to that.
2:32:41
Going back to your beginnings and fast-forwarding all the
2:32:44
way up to the present, just a kind of a synopsis statement.
2:32:47
How would you characterize the evolution of the relationship between public
2:32:53
agencies, BLM, Forest Service, Park Service, being the big three, during
2:32:59
your tenure, even adding in state agencies, and how you've seen that evolve?
2:33:07
I tell you, as ranger and forest supervisor and regional forester, my
2:33:12
partners were the directors of the Park Service at that level, Fish and Wildlife
2:33:19
folks at the state level, and the BLM where we were bordering each other.
2:33:29
I really considered them partners in public land management.
2:33:34
So, I had a lot of dealings with them.
2:33:39
I was with the Federal Executive Board in San Francisco, which brought
2:33:46
all the federal agencies together.
2:33:49
I had excellent relationships with the
2:33:55
Yellowstone, not Yellowstone, but Yosemite National Park and Sequoia
2:33:59
and Kings Canyon National parks, because the Sierra [National
2:34:01
Forest] was right between the two.
2:34:05
In fact, we helped Yosemite remove some timber that needed removing
2:34:13
in an out-of-the way place when it wasn't very popular to be cutting
2:34:19
timber in the national parks.
2:34:21
But the park superintendent wanted that to happen.
2:34:25
Was it a fire hazard issue, or a disease issue?
2:34:26
A disease issue.
2:34:27
So, we stopped that.
2:34:31
That's just some things I've done afterwards.
2:34:34
And I've been retired for a long time, about 35 years.
2:34:43
No, 25, 26.
2:34:45
'89.
2:34:46
28, 27?
2:34:46
Yeah, something like that.
2:34:47
Something like that.
2:34:48
I think I retired in early '89.
2:34:51
Twenty-five years.
2:34:53
Yeah, 25 years.
2:34:56
Now, going back to thinking about your father and your grandfather, the turf
2:35:01
wars between Interior and Agriculture were at times pretty strong over who
2:35:07
was going to run the show in what areas.
2:35:10
Do you ever remember them describing the "other agencies"
2:35:13
in any one way or another?
2:35:15
No, I think.
2:35:17
At least my family had a good partnership with the local people,
2:35:22
at whatever level they were.
2:35:24
But you know, it came and went by administration about moving
2:35:31
the Forest Service to Interior.
2:35:34
And I've always been opposed to that because I thought there was some value
2:35:41
in having two departments running so much of this land instead of just one.
2:35:47
If one went bad, the other one was probably going to be all right.
2:35:51
I'm having second thoughts about that now, because this administration and
2:35:57
some of the past ones here, recent ones, Agriculture is not just real
2:36:03
happy with the Forest Service in my view, or they're not unhappy, but they
2:36:08
don't see it as kind of their mission.
2:36:11
So, it may be that Interior's
2:36:16
an appropriate place for them.
2:36:20
You know, there was talk, about combining the BLM and the Forest Service.
2:36:26
That could happen, but then you've got such a giant agency that I think
2:36:30
maybe it's better to split them up.
2:36:31
And also, there's ecological differences.
2:36:35
I mean, the BLM does have forest lands.
2:36:38
Only in Oregon, really.
2:36:39
What?
2:36:39
Only in Oregon, really.
2:36:41
I mean, however you define forests.
2:36:41
I mean,
2:36:46
but they, there is some semblance, I mean, it used to be called the Grazing Service.
2:36:52
Yeah.
2:36:52
So, there's some semblance of that to more or less, ecosystem types or biomes.
2:36:59
It make sense.
2:37:00
So, there is a difference there.
2:37:02
And of course, you know that one of the original reasons why you
2:37:06
wouldn't have wanted to combine them was the General Land Office,
2:37:09
which was in Interior way back when.
2:37:12
This is right in the formative years, the glory years, the foundational years.
2:37:16
The Land Office had a pretty rotten reputation for corruption and graft.
2:37:21
And so, the nobility of the Forest Service and its mission, and what it
2:37:25
wanted to do and how it viewed itself, and still views itself, would have had
2:37:29
a hard time going back against that historical cross-current, I think.
2:37:34
That would be a tough one for even a lot of old-school forestry people to
2:37:38
go even today, 100-plus years later.
2:37:42
Now, you were going to say something else about what you've been doing
2:37:45
or done in Oregon at this level?
2:37:49
Just that those were good experiences and I think I was able to contribute
2:37:52
to the collaboration between the Forest Service and BLM and the state.
2:38:04
They weren't talking to each other all that much, and kind
2:38:07
of running independent things.
2:38:09
But, you know, especially on the national forests, the state and the
2:38:15
Forest Service have a tremendous partnership there with the state
2:38:20
regulating the Fish and Wildlife, and the Forest Service managing the habitat.
2:38:25
You can't live without one.
2:38:27
Right.
2:38:29
I just mentioned that because I spent a lot of time on that,
2:38:32
and it was a good experience.
2:38:34
And were some of the specific issues or political problems or things
2:38:40
that you dealt with and completed or succeeded at when you were there?
2:38:45
Well, we developed a plan for wolf reintroduction to Oregon.
2:38:53
It's a big deal.
2:38:54
And it's been interesting to watch that.
2:38:57
It's working.
2:38:59
The cougar population has exploded.
2:39:08
What's your opinion of, and this is an unrelated issue,
2:39:11
but I needed to ask you this.
2:39:13
The recent cougar euthanization that happened in the Hendricks
2:39:17
Park area here in Eugene?
2:39:18
Yeah, well, I think it had to be done.
2:39:19
You think so?
2:39:20
Yeah, sure.
2:39:21
You know, if you want cougars running around town, that's one thing.
2:39:25
You don't think they're able to be transplanted somewhere else or
2:39:29
-? Well, the problem is we've got an overpopulation statewide.
2:39:32
Right, okay.
2:39:34
When they eliminated dogs from hunting, the cougar population exploded.
2:39:40
And nobody wants more cougars now.
2:39:43
They're moving into areas that they've never been before.
2:39:46
So, you know, if you move that cougar into Grant County or
2:39:51
Harney County or wherever it is.
2:39:53
It's going to cause other problems?
2:39:56
Yeah, you're just going to cause other problems, it just
2:39:56
increases that whole business.
2:39:59
And once these cougars get accustomed to habitation and
2:40:04
people, it's hard to undo it.
2:40:08
Yeah, there was a time when we were hiking around Spencer's Butte
2:40:12
about six months ago early in the morning, and we heard something.
2:40:16
That's all I'll say.
2:40:18
We walked quickly.
2:40:20
Usually, they don't attack people, but still.
2:40:23
If you, runners, see, cougars are just like big cats.
2:40:29
They like to run after things and catch them.
2:40:31
Catch them.
2:40:33
And runners in California have been killed by cougars.
2:40:37
I don't think any in Oregon have.
2:40:39
But people running out in the woods, and the tail starts
2:40:44
to switch, and away they go.
2:40:47
It means they're excited.
2:40:49
Yeah, right.
2:40:50
Okay, let's go to something that really happened after you retired, but you've
2:40:54
watched and you know all the people, many of the people in the Forest Service that,
2:41:00
starting with the spotted owl injunction, and then the Northwest Forest Plan, and
2:41:05
everything that's happened since then.
2:41:09
How do you view that whole dynamic of coming up, we have an injunction over an
2:41:14
endangered species, a very controversial thing that literally locks down a
2:41:18
lot of areas from active forestry.
2:41:20
And then you have the Forest Plan, which evolved over a two-three-year
2:41:25
period of time, and became what it is.
2:41:29
How do you view that whole thing and how successful or not successful
2:41:34
the Northwest Forest Plan has been?
2:41:36
Well, I think it could have been successful, but it was not permitted to be
2:41:42
implemented, and therefore, not much is happening.
2:41:46
There's too many ways that you can stop anything you don't like.
2:41:51
And the strategy of some of these extreme groups is to just keep suing
2:41:58
the Forest Service and the BLM, and the courts are just stacked full,
2:42:03
they can't get to it for three or four years, and so everything stops.
2:42:07
There's no point in even trying.
2:42:09
If we had stuck with the Northwest Forest Plan and given it a chance, I
2:42:13
think it would have worked all right.
2:42:15
I didn't have any particular problem with it.
2:42:17
I think Jack Ward Thomas and those guys did a pretty good job.
2:42:21
What are the strengths of the actual plan?
2:42:24
Well, I don't know that I can say what they are.
2:42:28
At least, it established a reasonable concern for the endangered species,
2:42:35
in that case, the spotted owl, and it still allowed for timber harvest.
2:42:40
But now, the whole thing is just, it's not being implemented.
2:42:48
So,
2:42:52
you mentioned about wolves, an introduced species, and probably the
2:42:57
most controversial, certainly amongst rural ranching-type communities.
2:43:03
But other endangered species, obviously, indicator species like the spotted
2:43:08
owl, the marbled murrelet, others, what do you feel about the Endangered
2:43:13
Species Act, what it was intended to, and what is it actually doing?
2:43:20
I think that's
2:43:23
related to what I mentioned before.
2:43:26
We've got these statutes for the Forest Service mission, and so
2:43:30
forth, and those are all good.
2:43:34
The Multiple Use Act, the Wilderness Act, all those things, those
2:43:39
combined, work reasonably well.
2:43:42
There's some trade-offs, but the Forest Service and the
2:43:44
public could understand that.
2:43:46
But then NEPA comes along, and it gives them a lever to stop.
2:43:50
There's people that don't want to cut down a tree anywhere.
2:43:53
There's other people that don't want to stop fires anywhere.
2:43:57
Those kind of things interfere with the implementation of the basic statutes.
2:44:04
And therefore, I think the Endangered Species Act has given a lever to
2:44:11
a lot of people that just simply don't want any kind of activity.
2:44:15
And it can be the spotted owl, but it could also be frogs and lizards and
2:44:21
butterflies, you know, lots of things.
2:44:24
And that's sort of an irresponsible way to get your way.
2:44:29
And it gets so much litigation that it just stops the world.
2:44:34
And that's what happened
2:44:40
here.
2:44:40
So, you knew David Brower?
2:44:42
I did know him and I respected him, and I felt that he was very determined with
2:44:49
what he was going to do, but he would listen to you and he had some good humor.
2:44:55
I remember in Russia, one time, he said, well,
2:45:01
the Forest Service is,
2:45:06
something about reducing its clear-cutting, that "just selects a
2:45:12
melon, then clear-cuts it instead of," he said something kind of like that.
2:45:18
And I was always able to talk to him.
2:45:20
And in Russia, he was a good advisor on how to deal with some of the issues
2:45:28
there in terms of preservation and the utility of logging and so forth.
2:45:36
What do you remember about the condition of the forests around Lake Baikal?
2:45:40
Oh, they're in good shape.
2:45:41
Really?
2:45:41
Yeah.
2:45:42
In Russia, everything was targeted from Moscow.
2:45:47
Now,
2:45:51
is this still in the Soviet era, or are you in the post-Soviet era?
2:45:54
Well, I was in the post-Soviet era.
2:45:58
In fact, we went over there in 1992, and the Soviet Union had just collapsed.
2:46:03
Right, one year before, exactly.
2:46:05
And all the decision-making then went to the regions.
2:46:10
They were used to having targets established by Moscow.
2:46:15
And so, if you had a timber target, you had to get that out, and the
2:46:19
only way to do that really was to go along the railroads and the
2:46:23
infrastructure that was there and clear-cut or whatever you had to do.
2:46:27
So, the rest of the country, which was 99 percent, was untouched.
2:46:32
There's no roads, just a huge, the Siberian forest, the Taiga, is about the
2:46:40
size of the continental United States.
2:46:42
And for the most part, at least, it's untouched.
2:46:45
So, you're starting from scratch there.
2:46:47
Did they ship their logs to market via the Tran-Siberian Railroad or did those,
2:46:53
were they usually processed locally?
2:46:55
Both.
2:46:57
There were big sawmills in Ulan-Ude and Yakutsk and Chita, and all
2:47:02
those places that we worked in.
2:47:05
But they also went on railroad too, to the coast.
2:47:10
I suspect some of them were exported to China and Japan, etc., particularly
2:47:18
out of Vladivostok or Hvarska.
2:47:20
But there are
2:47:25
lots of sawmills throughout Russia, and some of them were
2:47:29
getting pretty sophisticated.
2:47:32
They were using Finnish equipment and doing a pretty good job.
2:47:39
What do you think about the evolution of the
2:47:44
logging/timber/wood products industry in this country?
2:47:48
Going back to the days when you started industrial forestry,
2:47:52
and all of its evolutions to the present, what have you seen?
2:47:56
And how local communities, mills, big, small and medium, have
2:48:00
adapted, and the whole system?
2:48:04
Well, I think that we had a very viable timber history in the West, at least.
2:48:14
Big mills, sophisticated mills, pulp mills, logging systems.
2:48:19
All those things were there, but gradually as
2:48:26
the ability of timber, particularly on the public lands, declined,
2:48:30
those mills went out of business.
2:48:33
And now, and you can see it all over Oregon, there's just a
2:48:40
miniscule amount of capability left if we ever got back into business.
2:48:44
There's not very many loggers left.
2:48:46
There's not very many sawmills left.
2:48:49
You've got a few.
2:48:50
You've got Rosboro, and Roseburg, and a few
2:48:55
others, and Weyerhaeuser.
2:48:56
Seneca?
2:48:56
And Seneca.
2:48:58
Those are primarily dependent on private properties, which is fine, and
2:49:03
they're doing a reasonably good job.
2:49:06
But people like Bohemia, and those folks, they went out
2:49:14
of business.
2:49:15
Even the pulp mill up in Albany, you see, they tore that thing down.
2:49:19
They're salvaging it for scrap.
2:49:22
The one right on I-5, right?
2:49:24
The highway, right.
2:49:25
And so, I think if we ever got back in the business, we would be sort of rebuilding
2:49:32
our industry here and its capability.
2:49:34
If you were going to idealize a future of responsible forestry, 50 years
2:49:41
down the road, what would you like to see happen if you had your ability
2:49:46
to plan without all the problems?
2:49:50
Yeah, well, I think if we could eliminate all the litigation and agree
2:49:55
on some level of production, I could envision that we'd be in good shape.
2:50:02
In 50 years from now, we'd be back in business.
2:50:05
We'd be taking advantage of the world's most productive forest in
2:50:10
the Pacific Northwest, and relieve some of the pressure on the tropical
2:50:17
forests, and places like Indonesia, Malaysia, where we're just stripping
2:50:23
those forests, and in South America.
2:50:25
Do you think that any of the local environmental groups even
2:50:29
see the big picture when you're talking about carbon sequestration
2:50:33
and global trade-off dynamics?
2:50:36
I think they're pretty much fixed on trying to stop what they feel has been
2:50:41
exploitation that was very destructive.
2:50:44
I don't blame them for that.
2:50:46
I think that eventually we've got to stop this idea that we can't cut any tree down.
2:50:50
But,
2:50:54
they've figured that out how to do that.
2:50:58
The problem is that we still use wood, and hopefully we'll continue, because
2:51:03
we don't want to see steel and aluminum be the primary construction materials.
2:51:10
That's not good.
2:51:11
What's the biggest danger to our national forests today?
2:51:16
And maybe even using a couple examples here in the Willamette.
2:51:20
Well, I think it's the lack of stewardship that is caused by, you
2:51:26
know, we did keep fire out for a long time and, but we substituted logging
2:51:31
and thinning and that sort of thing, to keep the ecosystems healthy.
2:51:37
And they're not healthy now.
2:51:39
They're overgrown, and there's bugs and then there's fires, and we're losing,
2:51:45
I don't think the environmentalists understand this, that they're actually
2:51:48
destroying the national forests.
2:51:51
Now, we don't want to go back to where we were, a clear-cut and burn kind of thing.
2:51:55
But we need to take advantage of the productivity in these forests
2:52:01
in a balanced form so that there's recreation and scenery and watersheds;
2:52:06
all those concerns accommodated, but allow for some harvest.
2:52:12
And this idea of saying, anything over 80
2:52:18
years-old is old growth, is probably ridiculous.
2:52:19
The Forest Service was using a 120 to 200-year rotation, which
2:52:23
was pretty generous, I thought, that it kept things alive.
2:52:30
So, I don't know, I guess it's hard to say.
2:52:33
What do you call old growth?
2:52:35
I mean, it was a term that you heard back in the '50s when you were
2:52:37
first coming in, but the cultural context has changed dramatically.
2:52:41
It has, yeah.
2:52:42
I don't consider 80-year pole timber old-growth.
2:52:46
150 or more, probably, 200?
2:52:48
Well, maybe 200 years.
2:52:50
And preserve things so that we have some 200-year-old trees, or even older.
2:52:56
There's nothing wrong with 400-year-old trees.
2:52:59
But you need to plan ahead, because if we just sit there and let them
2:53:06
die, or be burned up or killed by bugs, that's not going to help then.
2:53:12
Do you think fire or disease are the biggest threats to the Cascades,
2:53:17
Willamette, or the whole Cascade Range?
2:53:22
Well, probably fire is because of the situation we've created.
2:53:27
I mean, if these forests could be just
2:53:34
let alone, and then somehow it didn't have bug infestations and
2:53:38
fire, there would be no problem.
2:53:41
I mean, you wouldn't be destroying the land.
2:53:44
But some of these lands like Santiam Pass, it's going to be 100-150 years
2:53:50
before some of those areas are reforested.
2:53:53
Are you talking about the B&B burn?
2:53:55
Yeah, because, not all of it was burned that hard, but a lot of it was.
2:54:00
It was 100 and how many, 200,000 acres?
2:54:03
It was a big one, yeah.
2:54:04
It was a seriously hot fire, too.
2:54:05
Oh, yeah.
2:54:06
And the resources available to fight that fire were diverted to saving, you know,
2:54:13
habitations down there in Sisters and
2:54:17
up the Metolius.
2:54:18
Exactly.
2:54:19
And they just let the fire go.
2:54:23
So, there's a lot of things that have to be done.
2:54:26
First of all, we shouldn't allow people to build in these kind of places.
2:54:31
And then if they do build, where it's possible, they should
2:54:35
try to fireproof those things.
2:54:37
In other words, build, but lessen the fuel load close to your house?
2:54:41
Yeah, right.
2:54:42
Have a fire break of some kind.
2:54:44
Yeah, sure.
2:54:45
Right.
2:54:45
And not even build in some places.
2:54:47
And have a metal roof, so when you have the really-hot fires and
2:54:51
you're basically getting bombed by the fire from five miles away.
2:54:55
Exactly.
2:54:56
And a little bit like that Oso landslide in Washington, you know.
2:55:00
We all knew that was a landslide area.
2:55:03
Why did we let people build there?
2:55:06
And now, we're going probably have them rebuild, help them with that.
2:55:11
Yeah, I know.
2:55:12
That was poor zoning, probably a little dishonest real estate sales
2:55:17
pitches along the way, I would guess.
2:55:20
We're doing that with a lot of forest lands in the Colorado
2:55:24
Front Range [Rockies] near Denver.
2:55:26
We let people build all over that country, it's just burning up,
2:55:31
and we're losing a lot of houses.
2:55:33
When a fire starts, you've got to protect the houses, and let the fire go.
2:55:38
We're getting these huge fires now.
2:55:42
This summer may be a good
2:55:49
picture of how things are going gunnysack.
2:55:53
Now, there are likely some things we haven't discussed.
2:55:55
Now, can you think of anything that we haven't covered
2:55:58
that you'd like to bring up?
2:55:59
No, I can't think of anything left.
2:56:01
Okay, I'll bring up a couple more capstone questions here then.
2:56:07
What do you think could be improved within the U.S. Forest Service?
2:56:13
Well, I think part of it relates to the Department of Agriculture's leadership.
2:56:20
And we've been kind of stretched one way or the other,
2:56:27
administration by administration.
2:56:29
I think, somehow, we need to come back to the mission, the statute that
2:56:38
created the Forest Service, and not
2:56:43
get bogged down and just get paralyzed.
2:56:48
So, I think that would be the best thing that could happen to the Forest Service.
2:56:52
Somehow, give us our lead, hold us accountable, and
2:56:57
probably educate both the Congress and the urban population that what
2:57:04
we can do is improve our performance in managing the national forest.
2:57:16
Now, you're retired and you're living here in Oregon.
2:57:20
What makes Oregon special?
2:57:23
Culturally, politically, environmentally, geographically?
2:57:28
Well, it's a beautiful state to begin with.
2:57:30
Very pleasant to moderate climate for the most part.
2:57:34
We're halfway between the ocean and the Cascade crest.
2:57:37
I can ski in the morning and be at the coast that evening.
2:57:42
I like the general feeling of Oregonians.
2:57:50
It's changing, I think.
2:57:51
It's becoming a little polarized between east and west, and I don't like that.
2:57:56
You're talking about eastern Oregon?
2:57:57
Eastern Oregon and western Oregon.
2:57:59
But that's common in Montana and a lot of other places, as well.
2:58:03
There's a lot like there's the college towns of Bozeman and
2:58:06
Missoula, and everybody else, right?
2:58:08
Is that one way of looking at it?
2:58:09
I think there's some political things happening in Oregon that I don't like
2:58:14
to see, again, it's kind of polarized.
2:58:18
I
2:58:20
think we're up to where our population is big enough we
2:58:25
don't need too many more people.
2:58:30
I think the Willamette Valley from here to Portland is running the rest of
2:58:37
the state without listening too much.
2:58:39
And I appreciate the fact that Grant County
2:58:45
and Harney counties over there are just so frustrated, they come up with wild
2:58:49
ideas about no U.N., and this and that.
2:58:53
It's because they don't feel like they're being listened to.
2:58:57
So, I think we could improve that, but on balance, you know, we still like Oregon.
2:59:02
I'd just as soon as be in Montana, but I think Oregon is
2:59:06
easier for us in my old age.
2:59:09
It's easier on your bones in the winter time, right?
2:59:12
Yeah.
2:59:12
[Laughs]
2:59:15
Last question.
2:59:16
How do you view land management and the public lands
2:59:26
as an essential mission within the U.S. context, and why is
2:59:31
it important to get that right?
2:59:35
Well, first of all, I'd say that our public land system
2:59:40
is the envy of the world.
2:59:42
There's nothing quite like it.
2:59:43
We've got a very large segment of our country is in public
2:59:49
lands, various agencies.
2:59:52
We've got several agencies, some are very specialized, some are not so specialized.
2:59:58
But I think, again, we need to go back to the organic acts and the enabling acts
3:00:10
that created these agencies, Fish and Wildlife, Park Service, BLM, whatever
3:00:16
it might be, and really allow those agencies to achieve those missions.
3:00:24
I think they all integrate very well.
3:00:25
And it's a good blend of things that are important to us.
3:00:33
And
3:00:36
just by sheer amount of acreage, it's a huge chunk of our country.
3:00:44
It's a little imbalanced because you've got a lot in the East that never became
3:00:50
specially protected lands.
3:00:52
We have a good wilderness system.
3:00:54
And it's not quite complete yet, but I think it's on the way.
3:00:59
We need to protect that wilderness in the sense of what the statute says.
3:01:05
We get a little bit careless about allowing things that diminish it.
3:01:11
We don't want to be the lowest common denominator here.
3:01:13
We need the Fish and Wildlife Service to be open to fish-wildlife
3:01:18
preservation and science and so forth, and the Park Service, recreation
3:01:23
and preservation, Forest Service, multiple-use and scientific efforts,
3:01:29
and help to the state forests.
3:01:34
So, that's kind of a rambling answer, but I think it's all there, if we
3:01:39
could just get back to our business, and hopefully, that'll happen.
3:01:45
Related question.
3:01:46
I fibbed, one more.
3:01:49
How do you define the term conservation today, and how did
3:01:54
you define it in 1955 when you started your Forest Service career?
3:01:59
Well, in 1955, conservation was a more universal term that
3:02:06
most people could agree with.
3:02:08
Conservation today means different things to different people.
3:02:13
To some, it means preservation.
3:02:16
Others, it means sustainable development.
3:02:20
Others, it means,
3:02:24
you know, use it today and maybe it'll come back
3:02:29
tomorrow, that kind of thing.
3:02:30
My notion of conservation hasn't really changed too much as far as I'm
3:02:34
concerned, but I think to the public, it has changed quite a little bit.
3:02:41
Well, I'd like to thank you for a wonderful time talking about your
3:02:45
life and this project, and history and science and the Forest Service.
3:02:50
Thank you very much, Zane.
3:02:51
Sam, thank you for chiming in once in a while.
3:02:54
All right.
