00:01
Hello, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Historian and Courtesy
00:05
Faculty in the Forest Ecosystems and Society Department in the College of
00:09
Forestry, Oregon State University.
00:11
It is November 1, 2013, and I am in the Corvallis home of Dr. Fred
00:17
Swanson, Emeritus Scientist, U.S. Forest Service, well-known geologist
00:21
and ecosystem scientist, and long-time associate of the H.J. Andrews
00:25
Experimental Forest, the famous ecological research site in the Western
00:29
Oregon Cascades that is part of the National Science Foundation's Long-Term
00:34
Ecological Research [LTER] system.
00:37
This oral history interview is one of many such interviews that will
00:41
take place with past and present researchers, administrators, land
00:45
managers, policymakers and residents of the region near the Andrews Forest, one
00:50
component of a broader history project focused on the H.J. Andrews Experimental
00:55
Forest, the LTER system, ecosystem science, as well as environmental
00:59
and scientific issues in general.
01:01
Today we will be talking about a wide range of subjects that involve the Andrews
01:05
Forest, Dr. Swanson, and his more than 40-year involvement with the institution.
01:10
I want to thank you, Dr. Swanson, for taking time to meet me today.
01:13
How are you this morning?
01:15
Good.
01:16
All right, excellent.
01:16
I
01:19
always like to start these interviews with
01:23
interviewees telling me where they were born and raised, or simply asking
01:27
for a biographical sketch on their terms, however you wish to express it.
01:33
Okay, I was born in 1943 in Wilmington, Delaware.
01:39
And shortly thereafter, my family moved to the little town of Bon
01:46
Air outside of Richmond, Virginia.
01:49
I grew up there through fourth grade, and then we moved back to Wilmington,
01:53
Delaware, where I did my schooling and growing up until I went off to college as
02:01
an undergrad for four years at Penn State.
02:04
And then I moved west and worked for the Geological Survey at
02:10
Menlo Park, California, for a year before going to grad school
02:14
at the University of Oregon.
02:17
What was your childhood like back East, especially in
02:20
relation to the natural world?
02:24
Well, in Bon Air,
02:28
with me as a little boy through fourth grade, we lived out in the country.
02:34
I remember my mother telling me one day that we lived in a village.
02:38
That stuck with me.
02:42
And I had one friend there, a guy named Wendell Gaddis.
02:48
We liked to roam around in the fields and woods
02:56
near where we lived.
02:58
And there were fields and woods, and places that had been abandoned farms.
03:04
I remember some of the kinds of things we'd do like collecting box turtles
03:11
and fishing in little creeks, and
03:18
paying attention to snakes and things like that.
03:20
So, I did have some connection with the natural world.
03:25
And that would have been grade school age, correct?
03:26
Yes.
03:27
Right.
03:29
And how would you characterize the ecosystem of your first
03:34
hands-on experience with the natural world, now that you're
03:37
well-versed in the science of that.
03:41
But how would you express it today about the areas that you
03:44
were playing in as a child?
03:48
Well, I think that they probably experienced a conversion from forest
03:53
to low-grade agriculture perhaps in the 19th century, or maybe earlier.
04:02
But there wasn't active agriculture there.
04:05
It was a landscape that had forests and streams.
04:11
And so, but it wasn't big and wild forest.
04:17
There were a few big trees.
04:20
I remember my father, who had grown up in northern Michigan, was very
04:25
attentive to trees, liked trees.
04:27
I remember when some plumbers had used the crotch of a tree to help bend a
04:32
pipe and sort of damaged the tree, and my father gave the tree some first-aid.
04:38
So,
04:41
there was an element of the natural world where we lived, but it wasn't
04:45
a wild landscape such as we have examples of out here in the West.
04:52
Now, how and when did you become interested in science or natural history?
04:58
When did the childhood wonderment aspect change to something more,
05:02
shall we say, intellectual?
05:08
Well, I remember fishing with my father who was an avid fly fisherman,
05:15
although we lived in places where fly fishing wasn't very available
05:22
-- like the Mid-Atlantic states.
05:26
So, he'd try to do that on vacation time.
05:31
So that was one form of interaction with the natural
05:33
world that I saw exhibited within
05:39
my own family.
05:41
But also, I began collecting rocks and that was because
05:55
on both my father's side in northern Michigan and my mother's side of
06:02
the family in Janesville, Wisconsin, rocks and geology were an important
06:09
part of the local landscape.
06:12
My father grew up in Ishpeming, Michigan, which was a mining town.
06:18
And so, when we would go up there, I remember him taking me to visit neighbors
06:23
who had amazing rock collections.
06:28
Often, they were dominated by ore samples and
06:36
crystals and things that would be discovered associated with the
06:42
geology of that landscape, including what was available from mine
06:46
tailings and things of that nature.
06:48
I remember going rock-hounding with my dad at old mining sites.
06:55
And then on my mother's side, her father was one of the people that ran
07:00
the Janesville Sand & Gravel Company.
07:02
Southern Wisconsin, which was a glacial outwash, is composed of sands and gravels.
07:07
So, Janesville Sand & Gravel had these large open-pit gravel extraction
07:15
processes going on, and at times they were shipping 100 train cars of gravel down
07:21
to construct O'Hare Airport in Chicago per day, and during the Depression,
07:31
there were stories of these guys having to load train cars with individual
07:37
wheelbarrows and pushing them up planks.
07:40
So that was a glacial outwash, and every now and then they'd find a
07:47
Mastodon tusk, and I remember in the office of the company, there was
07:52
a big fragment of a Mastodon tusk.
07:54
And I remember my grandfather breaking off a chunk of that so I could take
07:59
it home and put in my rock collection.
08:01
So, I was getting some nature exposure, but not in a real "sciencey" sense.
08:11
My science training in high school, I didn't come away with a whole lot
08:19
that I can really put my finger on.
08:21
I got some exposure to biology, certainly, no geology.
08:27
So, going back to a little more philosophical question or area.
08:33
What were your views on nature and the environment?
08:36
You know, loaded words today with the cultural context, but how
08:40
would you view nature and the environment when you were small?
08:44
I mean, as you can best reconstruct how you might have seen it
08:47
through the eyes of a child.
08:52
Well, I remember enjoying being outside, and just exploring and playing outside.
09:03
And I don't remember when I first heard the word ecology but I'm sure it was not,
09:11
I don't think I ever heard it in my childhood.
09:14
Partly, as a matter of the times and the circles that I was traveling in.
09:22
Exposures occurred through things like fishing and just hanging out
09:27
and wanting to build forts out of the scrubby woods and things of this nature.
09:33
Now, you already described the ecology of, was it Delaware?
09:37
Correct?
09:38
Virginia and Delaware.
09:39
Virginia and Delaware.
09:40
Now, how would you describe its aesthetic?
09:45
Well, the switch from Virginia, which was a sort of, had a rural feel to it,
09:56
but it was gradually being developed.
10:00
Was this the Piedmont area of Virginia?
10:02
Yeah.
10:02
Okay.
10:03
And in Delaware, when we moved to Delaware, then we moved
10:08
into a more upscale suburban setting in northern Delaware.
10:15
We were only about five miles from the Pennsylvania line, which
10:20
was also the Mason-Dixon Line.
10:21
And so, I do have recollections of being in the South and sensing that.
10:29
But our yard, which is a pretty big lot, had some big, old trees in it.
10:38
I had to rake the leaves and mow the scrubby lawn that my father struggled
10:45
to maintain under the canopy of these rather large beech and oak trees.
10:52
And it was interesting to me many years later, to hear from a Japanese
10:57
friend, a guy who was spending a year in our group, and we've had quite a few
11:06
visitors with extended visits, visitors from Japan in our research group.
11:11
Well, this guy, Shigyo Kobayashi and his wife, went and were traveling around
11:17
in the East and visited my parents, who were very happy to entertain them.
11:24
And when he came back to Corvallis, he said, "Now, I see, you grew up in
11:29
an old-growth forest." I certainly had never perceived it that way.
11:36
And in some ways it was true, but it certainly wasn't a forest,
11:40
it was a suburban landscape.
11:44
But we did have creeks nearby, but they were polluted and we avoided them.
11:52
This, of course, was pre-environmental age, so whatever was close to
11:56
industry in those days, was close to industry [Pollution-point sources]
12:01
. Yeah.
12:01
In this case, their streams were small and industry wasn't polluting those streams
12:06
immediately, but there were probably poor septic systems and things of that kind.
12:10
Exactly.
12:10
Rural county area, yeah.
12:12
One thing, in high school, I was very serious about running, cross-country
12:19
running and track running.
12:20
And I really loved running in the fall and running in the parks and other
12:25
places where we would train or compete, and crunching through the leaves.
12:30
And just the smells and the sounds and the colors, they're
12:35
something I really appreciated.
12:40
Now, how would you compare what you've described so far in Delaware and Virginia
12:46
mostly, also a little bit filtered through your family in Michigan and Wisconsin,
12:52
how would you compare the ecology and the aesthetic to the Pacific Northwest?
12:56
If you were going to make a sketch of that in a comparison sense.
13:02
Well, I really appreciate that my parents took our family on some travels.
13:10
We went to Yellowstone and we flew out to
13:17
San Francisco and went to Yosemite, and traveled around in northern California.
13:25
Took the train up to Kelso-Longview, where we had friends who had been
13:30
neighbors in Delaware, but then they had moved, and then the man in the
13:38
family, he was in the Weyerhaeuser family and worked for Weyerhaeuser.
13:41
And I remember, I think it was 1962, they took us up to Mount St. Helens,
13:47
which really was my first exposure there.
13:51
Spirit Lake?
13:52
Yes.
13:53
And I remember that we went to a tree on the shore of Spirit Lake,
13:58
and there was a hand-crank phone.
14:00
And you called over to a lodge, the Harmony Falls Lodge, and asked them to
14:04
come pick you up in their motorboat.
14:07
And you'd order up a family-style fried chicken dinner, and they'd come
14:11
pick you up, motor you over there, you'd eat it, and then we walked
14:15
back along the shore of the lake.
14:17
You didn't get a chance to meet Harry Truman on that trip, did you?
14:19
No, I didn't.
14:21
I would have liked to.
14:22
That was '62, I believe, which would have been the year after
14:27
I graduated from high school.
14:31
But
14:34
I was really fascinated by the West.
14:37
And the points of contrast include just the wildness, the sense
14:42
of wildness, the big mountains,
14:48
and the sparser, human population.
14:53
Those were all features of the West that I was attracted to.
14:56
So, was it more of the bigness and the scope, rather than a particular
15:01
aesthetic or ecosystem dynamic, or was it a little of both, do you think?
15:08
I think it was both.
15:11
I was getting interested in expressions of the West Coast.
15:20
This would have been in high school, and then, college at Penn State.
15:27
Edward Weston, Kenneth Rexroth, and Gary Snyder, these people who were writing
15:33
and photographing Western landscapes, and telling stories of life and with
15:43
a western spirit, west coast spirit.
15:47
And so those things fascinated me and they gradually were drawing my interest
15:52
to the world view and the landscape.
16:00
You may have never read Horace Greeley's "Manifesto to Go West,"
16:04
but, in essence, you were drawn to whatever that "West was for you.
16:09
Right?
16:10
Right.
16:12
And a set of circumstances got me west, a lot of it around geology, a key sequence
16:25
which will come up later in the interview.
16:27
But as an undergraduate in geology at Penn State and most other universities, you
16:36
had to go do a summer geology field camp.
16:40
And our scene at Penn State was that you went and hopped in some old "carryalls."
16:46
I remember one of our vehicles was a big, orange International Harvester Travelall
16:53
called "Ferro Hippus" [as in iron horse] . And we drove from central
16:57
Pennsylvania down to Roswell, New Mexico, and then, north to Red Lodge,
17:02
Montana, over the course of three weeks, camping out along the way.
17:06
We had some Iraqi students, I remember, they'd never seen snow before.
17:11
We were camping up high
17:15
in June in the far Southwest and we got snowed on at night.
17:19
And it was really cold, froze their butts and blew their minds.
17:25
But we were geologizing all the way and then we had five weeks of mapping
17:31
activities at the Yellowstone Big Horn Research Association Camp on
17:36
the flanks of the Beartooth Mountains outside of Red Lodge, Montana.
17:40
Oh, yeah.
17:41
At the entrance to, one of the entrances to Yellowstone.
17:48
So, we went to many interesting places there for out projects, including up to
17:54
10,000 feet on the Hell Roaring Plateau on the way into Yellowstone through
17:59
Cooke City, and remember being told that when the summer afternoon thunderstorms
18:05
came rumbling through, if our rock hammers began to sing, we needed to put
18:11
them aside and get a distance from them because it might get hit by lightning.
18:16
So, that was a wild and wonderful experience.
18:21
And then, from there with one other guy in the class, I hitch-hiked
18:26
down to Reno where I met up with some college friends and we drove
18:32
up into this part of the world.
18:35
I remember, that was 1965,
18:39
and there had just been the Christmas storm of '64.
18:45
The flood?
18:46
Yeah, and I remember going over the back road that comes out towards the
18:50
Eureka-Arcata area over the Coast Mountains of California, and seeing this
18:56
incredible flood damage and signs on trees well above the roads in a flood level.
19:03
I thought, wow, this is wild country.
19:06
And we came up to Junction City, I remember picking pole beans and
19:09
staying in a ramshackle migrant worker place for a few days, and
19:14
realized that was pretty hard work.
19:16
But anyway, then the following summer, I had the great good fortune to get us into
19:24
a special program that where you could be a field assistant for a U.S. Geological
19:31
Survey geologist doing their field work.
19:35
You could say what part of the country and what geological topic you were
19:40
interested in, and they tried to match you up as best they could.
19:43
That got me back out to Menlo Park, and the field area was along the
19:47
southern Oregon coast from Coos Bay down to Brookings, and looking for gold
19:53
and platinum and other heavy metals, primarily in the context of the Cold
19:57
War, in beach sands, modern beach sands, uplifted beach sands and rivers.
20:03
And there was an offshore component at Oregon State University.
20:08
And then, the river component, the bedrock geology component, was
20:12
people at the University of Oregon.
20:13
So, that led me to go to the U of O and to geology there as a grad student.
20:18
Now, going back to Penn State, why geology and who maybe was a real influential
20:28
professor on you, and what do you remember in terms of the schools of thought of
20:33
geology that you were trained in, and how you got tracked or attracted to that?
20:40
Well,
20:44
I remember my parents wondering, asking me if I wanted to be an engineer.
20:52
And my father, you know, was a chemical engineer.
20:55
And I was sort of science-oriented, but I also was inspired by some
21:03
English teachers in high school.
21:06
And that fueled my interest in some of the writers that I mentioned before.
21:14
And it's been totally amazing to me to come back around to them and
21:18
actually get to interact with some of them, 40 and 50 years later.
21:26
But
21:31
I, and also my mother's brothers, who died quite young of TB, they'd
21:37
both been lawyers and wondered if I wanted to be a lawyer.
21:42
Well, in the end, I picked Penn State because it was about the right
21:46
distance away and I was serious about my running, and I could run
21:52
track and cross-country there.
21:54
And
21:57
I wasn't real academically-oriented.
22:02
And so, I feel like I sort of slipped into geology from the
22:08
get-go a little bit by default.
22:11
There wasn't anything that was more interesting to me.
22:14
And then I had to stick with it
22:19
because I wasn't finding anything more interesting.
22:21
And I started out and it had a lot of geochemistry and minerology, and
22:26
geophysics and things like that.
22:28
And it was only a summer field experience after my freshman year,
22:35
and then, a duplication of that after sophomore year, that really convinced
22:42
me that this is a cool place to be.
22:46
And this was the experience of getting to go to the Bermuda Biological Station.
22:51
My advisor at Penn State, Robert F. Schmalz, who was a very cool and
23:00
interesting guy with a neat sense of humor, and I remember that he
23:07
arranged so that I could go to the Bermuda Biological Station and take
23:13
part as an underclass person in a grad student program that was sponsored
23:21
by, I believe it was by the National Science Foundation, on organism-sediment
23:26
relationships in a modern environment of carbonate deposition.
23:32
So, in other words, you got some early ecological training in your
23:35
geology from the get-go, then?
23:37
Now, when I have encountered Research Experience for Undergraduate [REU]
23:42
groups at the Andrews, I say, "I had an experience after my freshman
23:49
year that launched me on a career of interdisciplinarity that is still
23:59
deeply ingrained in me. I hope some of you will be shaped in the same way by
24:00
your experience here." It was so cool.
24:02
It was literally an immersion experience because this was a
24:07
place where calcium carbonate was being deposited, and the petroleum
24:13
industry was interested in this work.
24:14
And I think my advisor had some support from them through the petroleum industry
24:22
that made it possible to help me get over there to Bermuda where this former small
24:31
hotel had been converted into a biology lab, and there were a few small ships.
24:35
I remember one of them was the "Panulirus," which is the genus of lobster
24:40
that is characteristic, common in Bermuda.
24:46
And so, there were faculty and students, grad students, in sea water
24:53
chemistry, biology, and their many calcareous organisms, algae, mollusks,
25:02
etc., that made calcium carbonate skeletons, so that when they died,
25:09
this would all accumulate and become
25:13
sediment.
25:15
So, there were sea water chemists, biologists and
25:20
geologists, all working together.
25:21
And we'd go out and, you know, dive into the subject matter.
25:28
Literally.
25:29
Yeah, and chase certain topics that included, diel variation and the
25:39
processes related to sunlight and photosynthesis, and those things
25:46
were changing on a 24-hour schedule.
25:48
So, it was neat because you were conducting studies where you had
25:53
to pay attention to the tides and the state of light and so forth.
26:00
One of those students was Stephen Jay Gould, who was obviously an
26:05
"out-there" guy at that time.
26:10
[Break in audio]
26:14
Now, you already spoke about some of your experiences as a youth as
26:18
you had in the natural environment back in Delaware and Virginia.
26:21
Now, what impact do you think any of those experiences had on
26:25
your later career professionally?
26:28
Any particular incident, maybe even something that you didn't mention,
26:31
something that was impactful to you as a child, or maybe something that made
26:36
a negative impact on you, something you saw or experienced or were scared by?
26:43
It's hard for me to pick out anything
26:48
in the K-12 years other than just a natural enjoyment of being outside
26:56
and being physically active outside.
27:01
As I mentioned, there was some rock-hounding and there was some
27:06
running outdoors.
27:09
I enjoyed those things.
27:13
I enjoyed the vacations to places like Yellowstone and Yosemite
27:18
and seeing big landscapes.
27:21
And hanging out a little bit around the Janesville Sand & Gravel Company.
27:25
But that was as much about big equipment like trains and cement mixers.
27:31
Just like we liked Tonka toys when we were kids, right?
27:34
Yeah.
27:34
Exactly.
27:37
Now, how do you think the location of your formative years affected
27:43
your views on science, ecology, and a career in geology/ecosystems science,
27:50
especially that centered at the Andrews and within the LTER system?
27:54
A real philosophical question, but maybe think a bit how that context may
27:59
have affected your later development, intellectually and otherwise.
28:05
Oh, I think the main thing is growing, probably growing
28:11
up in a suburban community
28:18
in a region where,
28:22
although it was not in academics in a university sense area, it was there
28:34
where many people who worked for DuPont and other chemical companies.
28:38
There were a lot of engineers and people who were quite well-trained.
28:46
And those were the guys, that had advanced degrees, and the women were very smart.
28:52
And most of them had college degrees, and of course, they were stay-at-home moms.
29:01
And there was a lot of attention to the school system and trying to have a good
29:07
education, so you could go on to college.
29:10
So, that was an important factor.
29:13
But where I've ended up going professionally, I wasn't really
29:20
being shaped much by that early history, I don't believe.
29:25
At least, that you're conscious of.
29:27
In specific ways.
29:28
Right, okay.
29:31
Now, how do you think the contrast between your home state environment and
29:35
the Northwest affected your perspective, scientifically or culturally, on the
29:41
Coniferous Forest Biome that is home to the H.J. Andrews Experimental
29:45
Forest, and that composes much of the Pacific Northwest geography?
29:52
Well, I wasn't getting exposed much in the way of coniferous
29:57
forests back east as I mentioned.
30:01
Our yard had these big hardwoods, hence, a lot of leaves to rake.
30:07
But the question was, the contrast, how that might have affected you?
30:11
Especially, when you talked about your youth, your trips as a youth, and then
30:14
later with Penn State, getting exposed to that, how that contrast maybe stretched
30:19
you, intellectually and imagination-wise?
30:24
One thing about my whole career which I think about in the context
30:28
of talking with either students at OSU or our young generation and our
30:38
family about career paths, one thing that's really impressed me as I reflect
30:43
back on my career path, is it has taken some very unlikely directions.
30:50
And I could not have imagined the types of work that I have ended up
30:57
being able to do when I was very young, because I had no exposure to it.
31:04
For example, I didn't know any geologists,
31:08
earth scientists, or ecologists
31:15
when I was in the K-12 years that I recognized as such.
31:20
And so, when I've talked with kids today, it's sort of like, wow,
31:26
the world is changing even more rapidly now than it was in my time.
31:31
So, I can well imagine that you are going to have jobs that you can't anticipate
31:35
today because those jobs don't exist yet.
31:38
And that's the way I felt like a lot of my professional life has gone.
31:44
Just follow your nose, and let these interesting things
31:47
happen, and be ready to create
31:53
and react.
31:57
Now, once again, going back to your formative years and the location, how
32:01
do you believe the location of your formative years and experiences there
32:05
affected your views on the concept of place, both scientifically and culturally?
32:13
And I believe that you understand the difference between placed research
32:17
in the scientific ecological sense and cultural concepts of place.
32:22
So, if you can speak to either/or, or both of those subjects,
32:26
that would be really helpful.
32:28
I
32:32
feel like I did have an early sense of place and wanting to be immersed in place.
32:43
And the notion of immersion is one that has come into sharper focus
32:49
for me just in about the last week.
32:53
Having read a brief excerpt of a long interview in a writer's journal,
33:02
the Writer's Chronicle, an interview with Jane Hirshfield, Zen poet of
33:10
the San Francisco Bay area, who was a writer-in-residence at the Andrews.
33:13
She talked about the sense of immersion she had in the Andrews Forest, and
33:18
she wanted to carry through on it even to the point of jumping into
33:23
the creek at, she said, 34 degrees.
33:28
I'm sure it felt that cold.
33:32
And I think that's a feature of the Andrews Forest, where you have trees
33:37
70, 80, even 90 meters tall, that are all draped in the lichens and mosses.
33:45
And there's just this sense of being immersed in this massive forest ecosystem.
33:55
So, anyway, I have a feeling that I've really appreciated the natural world.
34:03
From my youth and Delaware, for example, I was very intrigued by the work of
34:09
the Wyeth family, Andrew Wyeth and his earlier kin and Jamie, his offspring.
34:20
There is a beautiful area, Chadds Ford area in southeastern Pennsylvania.
34:24
It was a very short drive from where I grew up.
34:27
And now there's a very beautiful museum there, and I like going out in that
34:32
kind of rural, rolling countryside.
34:35
It does have some huge, old DuPont estates, so that the land has
34:41
not been all highly-developed.
34:44
Wyeth painted these images of, what could be viewed as rather
34:52
bleak, often it's winter, autumn, and there may be people present or
35:00
people not present in these images.
35:02
But, you know, that is a depiction that
35:08
sticks in my mind of that landscape.
35:11
So, there's
35:14
some topography, the Brandywine River,
35:21
and there's art that expresses a sense of beauty of the landscape.
35:27
And then there's this very deep Euro presence many centuries deep.
35:32
So, out here in the West, our European footprint is not nearly as deep.
35:40
Do you always feel that it was more in the, shall we say, almost
35:45
like the 18th-19th century romantic European sense of wonder, and not
35:49
in a primitivist sense of wonder, in
35:56
how a lot of Americans have in the Post-Modern era,
35:59
have an almost-primitivism, which is anti-European,
36:03
consciously or unconsciously?
36:07
I think that is true.
36:18
As I spent more and more time in the West, on my own, the subject
36:22
matter of my research of what have the landscape histories been, how
36:30
Euro influence on the landscape has changed over time, and what was
36:34
the interaction, engagement of the native people, with this landscape.
36:40
These are things that I've studied, but I also
36:45
am intrigued by them more of an aesthetic sense.
36:48
It's interesting to note that just a couple days ago, I got a copy of
36:54
this essay by a scholar-in-residence, Aaron Ellison, who is an
37:03
ecologist at Harvard Forest.
37:05
But he wrote this essay in the Landscape Journal.
37:09
He goes back, looks back about 150 years of how early landscape painters viewed
37:15
the landscape, how early ecologists viewed the landscape, and the notion of the
37:19
balance of nature and how self-regulating nature might be perceived to be.
37:29
He brings it up to the present, and includes photography, artwork
37:35
and, actually, a histogram of tree ages in this piece of writing that
37:41
includes an art history component.
37:44
So, art, no, cultural understanding of the landscape in both artistic
37:53
and ecological research senses.
37:56
So, anyway, I think I've had a gut feeling or questioning and
38:05
wondering about that for a long time.
38:07
And so, it's been fruitful to me to have both an east coast
38:15
and a west coast perspective,
38:20
and the juxtaposition is intriguing and informative.
38:28
What were, on some of those early trips, whether it be with your family
38:33
or after Penn State, any of those, what were some iconic landscapes or
38:38
land forms or something that just impacted you strongly and made you
38:45
either think about something, or just shocked you with a sense of wonder?
38:53
Well, I love landscapes.
38:55
And I sometimes think, well, my favorite types of landscapes are volcanic craters.
39:05
I like very primal places that are so
39:13
difficult and challenging physically, that we can't go there or go
39:21
there only with great difficulty.
39:24
And every time I've gone to an amazing landscape, I thought, "You know, it'd
39:29
be neat to build a career around that."
39:35
And so, Bermuda was a wonderful landscape, not challenging.
39:41
Some of the Western landscapes I encountered in my geology field course.
39:48
The Beartooths?
39:49
Yes.
39:49
The Beartooth Mountains or this
39:54
area where we had a mapping problem which is full of rattlesnakes over in
39:57
Wyoming, a breached, doubly-plunging anticline, which is where the rocks
40:03
were folded in such a way that, where there could be oil trapped at depth.
40:11
And so, people were looking at the surface expressions of the geology and then
40:15
trying to interpret what the below-ground expression was in seeking gas and oil.
40:22
But also, then I got to go to the Galapagos and to Greenland on
40:30
geology expeditions, and they were wonderful, amazing landscapes.
40:35
As it is, I invested much of my career into charismatic, iconic landscapes,
40:46
the Andrews Forest and Mount St. Helens.
40:50
And right now in my retirement, I see a big part of what I'm trying
40:56
to do is to honor those landscapes which gave me so much, and to help
41:04
others adopt them as teachers.
41:08
And I'll say more about this later in the interview, but it's amazing to me
41:12
to think of how these places have been teachers, and I want to honor them.
41:21
And also, these places are embodiments of our bioregional icons.
41:26
You think of the Northwest, you think of volcanoes, active ones.
41:30
And you think of ancient forests, fast, cold rivers and our science,
41:37
and then the culture that we are now fostering around these regional icons.
41:47
This is an important social dimension of what we're doing.
41:51
And this is the jag that I'm on now, starting to realize this after
41:59
working in these places for decades.
42:04
Now, you partly answered your educational component of the interview
42:08
here, but this is more general.
42:10
And you can start with the university years or go forward with it.
42:14
Who were some of your scientific heroes and role models as
42:19
you developed intellectually?
42:20
Like maybe a university professor, or a famous author, or a geologist
42:26
from the past, or even a poet?
42:29
I mean, give me kind of a little progression of how that went.
42:38
Well, at the high school level, the teachers I remember most vividly
42:50
are, were English teachers, although I wasn't a very good student.
42:55
And
42:59
I think what they instilled was an interest in literature.
43:06
Julia [Jones, partner] and I talk about that now when we look across
43:11
the spectrum of teachers that Gareth [son] , age 16, a junior in Corvallis
43:16
High School has, and which are cracking the whip and really putting a lot of
43:22
focus on grades and are tough graders, so the kids are always on edge, and
43:27
which tend to want to emphasize passion.
43:31
We want to stimulate passion in these kids, or help them to express
43:34
the passion they may already have.
43:36
So anyway, at the high school level were two English teachers.
43:42
In college, it was in the sciences and
43:48
Bob, Robert F. Schmalz, was key because he gave me a chance to do some things.
43:53
Your Penn State professor, right?
43:54
Yeah, Penn State.
43:55
Right from the get-go.
43:56
I remember, the last exam of exam week was at night of, the last day.
44:05
And I had read in The New York Times a little piece of filler, maybe two
44:11
inches of column length about some group who was looking for meteorites
44:18
in the desert of central Australia by driving Land Rovers with
44:25
detection equipment on booms that stretched out from both
44:29
sides of the Land Rover.
44:30
And I thought, "Oh, I wonder if I could get to be a field assistant on that." I
44:33
just wanted to go do something because I was really jazzed by this geology stuff.
44:39
And I'd taken two courses from him.
44:41
And so, I turned in my exam to him, and I said, "Hey, I --" or I'd gone
44:48
to talk to him, that's what it was. I had gone to talk to him before the
44:51
exam and I said, "I'm interested.
44:53
Is there anything you can suggest?
44:55
I don't actually have to make money.
44:58
My parents would support me to do something like that." And so, I
45:01
turned in my exam that last exam time, and he said, "I may have something
45:06
for you." And then, that's how it developed to get to go to Bermuda.
45:11
So, that was very influential
45:14
for me.
45:15
Then, there were some poets that I was reading, some of these west coast people.
45:19
And a key thing in that work for me, was to get the sense that
45:26
in the course of your daily life, and to me especially if I'm out
45:31
in the wild, these little bits of poems will happen to you every day.
45:39
So, if you can foster that sense, you can catch 'em better, recognize them.
45:49
But was there a geologist that you were impacted by, or somebody that was a role
45:56
model or an icon of history in geology?
46:02
Oh, as my experience began to grow, I feel like I was more awed
46:10
by the ecosystems and geosystems.
46:14
Like, the Odums [Howard and Eugene] and
46:16
-- ? Well, definitely, as I began to get exposed to ecology as a geologist.
46:22
Because they were becoming who they were at that very time.
46:25
Right.
46:26
I was very interested in
46:30
systems thinking,
46:35
and certainly, their work was of interest to me in that regard.
46:43
So that was as a grad student, I was getting exposed to that,
46:48
and they were very current.
46:50
And
46:53
I was beginning to, as a grad student, I was getting quite interested in
46:57
environmental matters, and environmental issues were really picking up.
47:02
And that's when you were at the University of Oregon.
47:04
Correct?
47:05
Correct.
47:05
Want to elaborate just a little bit on how you came to be at Oregon?
47:11
Right.
47:11
So, I was, as an undergrad at Penn State, this was like '65,
47:21
early '66.
47:23
The draft was operating.
47:26
Vietnam?
47:27
Wow, didn't want to go to Vietnam.
47:30
There were teach-ins on campus and stuff like that.
47:34
Berkeley was being weird.
47:36
And I remember we had a big sit-in at the student union, in the
47:40
administration building at Penn State.
47:42
Our issues were not global, it was in loco parentis.
47:46
And so, you know, just sort of provincial issues.
47:50
Yeah.
47:50
But,
47:53
then we all got trucked down, all of us who were seniors, got trucked down to an
47:58
Army base in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and we went through our physicals,
48:05
and how that might influence our future.
48:09
And I had a very quirky, lucky set of circumstances.
48:14
Lucky from my perspective.
48:16
That when I was running cross-country for Penn State, I was running down
48:22
a steep hill and hit the bottom, and sort of jarred my back, I think.
48:28
Then I had back pain issues, and I went and got x-rays and got an
48:34
interpretation that I had some genetic malfunction, mal-form in my back,
48:40
like an extra half-vertebra, and some of the vertebrae were fused.
48:45
So, I took those x-rays to that
48:52
medical exam.
48:56
The doctor looked at them quickly, and I got a signed,
49:01
I forget what it was, 1Y, which is not a complete exemption, that you
49:06
were in a medically-impaired category.
49:10
So that freed me from
49:12
-- The draft?
49:13
The draft.
49:14
Wow.
49:14
So then, I got this opportunity to go, because I did okay in that field
49:20
course in Montana, then I qualified for an opportunity to go work for the
49:28
U.S.G.S. through a program that's in
49:31
-- That's in Menlo Park, correct?
49:34
That's a major office and that's the one that I went to work in.
49:36
Okay, got you.
49:39
I said that I wanted to work on the west coast because my girlfriend at the
49:41
time wanted to go out to San Francisco.
49:44
And I wanted to work in marine geology, and my Bermuda experience
49:48
had been around marine geology.
49:50
Got you.
49:50
So, they assigned me there, and then, I got to go do this work on the southern
49:54
Oregon coast, and for a guy, Ed Clifton, who was a U.S.G.S. geologist.
50:02
And that was a great opportunity.
50:05
I met people through that experience that then helped me later in my career,
50:12
including my connections into Mount St. Helens so I could get to go out on Day 10,
50:20
May 28, 1980, and through a U.S.G.S. connection, rather than a Forest
50:26
Service connection, although I was a Forest Service employee at that time.
50:31
But anyway,
50:35
I had thought I wanted to go into marine geology, and so I applied to a
50:39
few schools, including Oregon State.
50:42
But then after I'd gone out on ships a few times and got seasick, including at
50:50
Bermuda, I realized that I didn't want to go and study an environment like
50:56
sediment on the bottom of the sea, where my access was via a two-mile long cable
51:02
and some funky sampling device down at the bottom you hope's going to work.
51:07
Meanwhile, I'm up on deck throwing up.
51:10
So, anyway, I wanted to get out and get closer to the world of my subject matter.
51:15
You realized you were a landlubber?
51:17
Yeah.
51:19
So, that was a decision point in there.
51:20
And then I met the two profs from the University of Oregon who were associated
51:24
with this Geological Survey project.
51:27
And what were their names?
51:29
Sam Boggs, who ended up being my advisor, and Ewart Baldwin, who was the other one.
51:36
So, I ended up going there.
51:40
I had been a bit adrift at Penn State.
51:42
I started out and performed very well for several years, and then my grades
51:45
sort of went down after I quit running after sort of a run-in with the coach.
51:50
But although I had more time, I had less attention.
51:54
And so, my grades really suffered the latter years of my undergraduate career.
52:01
So, I was looking to just do a master's and sort of after my year off working for
52:07
the Survey, because I worked in Menlo Park between two field seasons and worked both
52:11
field seasons, as well, for the U.S.G.S. I
52:17
just wanted to get a master's and get my intellectual feet under me.
52:21
But they offered me a Ph.D., a fellowship to work towards a
52:27
Ph.D., an NDEA fellowship, National Defense Education Act fellowship.
52:34
So, it was interesting that this is in the context of the Cold War.
52:39
The U.S.G.S. project was about finding heavy metals so we were in a position
52:44
to compete with the Soviet Union.
52:47
And the fellowship that paid for most of my five years as a grad student was
52:54
similarly for staffing of our nation with Ph.D.'s in the context of the Cold War.
53:04
Anyway, I didn't really want a Ph.D., but it was recommended to
53:08
me that I go for the fellowship.
53:11
I did it.
53:12
It was a crazy time with a lot of unrest, nationally.
53:21
But I did it and I stuck with it.
53:22
And what years were you at Oregon?
53:26
I began in the Fall of '67, and I completed in '72.
53:35
And did you stay at Oregon in a post-doc capacity for a while?
53:39
And then I stayed at Oregon for another three-plus years as a post-doc with
53:46
the International Biological Program [IBP] . So, all my colleagues were in
53:50
Corvallis, but we worked at the Andrews.
53:55
And I was closer to the Andrews from Eugene than is Corvallis.
53:56
Now, we're going to go transition to the Andrews here soon, the
53:56
first visit, that kind of thing.
53:56
But first, say what
54:03
you want in terms of disciplines, geology, ecosystems science,
54:03
that apply to your development.
54:03
For
54:10
example, what were core theories and paradigms in your discipline, or
54:25
in your case, I'll say disciplines, plural, that you embraced as a student,
54:30
and have those remained foundational to your work, or has new evidence
54:34
and career maturation produced paradigm shifts in your core beliefs
54:40
about those original foundational
54:44
paradigms, beliefs, systems, etc.?
54:51
It's been interesting to me to read all the questions you
54:57
are using in this interview,
55:03
and to think about my career in that context, in the context of
55:09
these questions, like reference to paradigms and theories and so forth.
55:13
Because I don't think of myself as operating very much in that regard.
55:24
But maybe I just am lacking in certain self-awareness in this respect.
55:30
But
55:33
in my time as a student, for example, on the geology front, the
55:41
major paradigm shift probably in all of geology scholarship history
55:47
was taking place, plate tectonics.
55:50
And I remember at Penn State with J. Tuzo Wilson, the Canadian who was pushing plate
55:56
tectonics, showed up to give a lecture, and there was a lot of skepticism.
56:01
This was in, maybe '64 or '65.
56:09
And I remember, Robert F. Schmalz had raised in '62 in
56:13
the general geology class,
56:19
the issues that people were tussling with, such as, do we have an expanding
56:24
earth or a contracting earth?
56:26
And how could this be, for example, what were the strengths and
56:30
weaknesses of the opposing hypotheses.
56:34
So, actually, the Galapagos work that I and other grad students
56:42
went and did in 1971, we framed in a plate tectonics context.
56:46
We studied the geology of three islands distributed along a transect
56:55
away from a spreading center.
56:57
And so, we were proposing that they're getting progressively older the further
57:01
away from the spreading center you go.
57:05
And so, we did various uses of
57:10
paleomagnetic stratigraphy and potassium-argon dating to try to
57:14
look at the ages and other things.
57:17
So, anyway, on the geology front, that was an important transition
57:24
that was occurring that I was intrigued by, and it did influence
57:30
the science that I ended up doing.
57:34
How so?
57:35
Well, it mainly was manifest in
57:40
the design of the successful student-originated interdisciplinary
57:45
research proposal to NSF that was successful.
57:50
We got $35,000.
57:52
And it took seven students to the Galapagos for studies of
57:59
geology/volcanology, seismology and some plant ecology.
58:06
And what year was this in?
58:08
That was about '70.
58:11
So, you were in the middle of your Ph.D. program at that point?
58:14
Right.
58:14
And this was not my dissertation topic.
58:17
This was following my bliss, you know, following a passion.
58:23
Because I was doing my dissertation on gravel movement in the Elk
58:29
River, which was sort of a legacy of that "U.S.G.S. Southern Coast
58:34
experience." And loving that landscape down there in picking a problem or
58:40
project that would keep me there.
58:42
But it was not, I've never published anything other than one abstract.
58:48
From the Galapagos?
58:49
No, from the river [Elk]
58:50
. Oh, okay.
58:53
Can a river sense the shape of pebbles, was the topic.
59:01
But I got started on it, and I kept with it.
59:05
Meanwhile, plate tectonics was erupting all around us.
59:11
And so, I led the charge amongst our student group to go get that proposal
59:16
written and we were successful.
59:19
And we ended up, for $35,000, we ended up with a short article in
59:26
Nature, and a substantive paper reviewing our geology findings for
59:32
all three islands in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America.
59:37
One guy completed a Ph.D. based on that work, and then there was a
59:42
master's on some of the plant work.
59:44
So, that is a hell of a payoff.
59:46
That was a very successful venture.
59:49
It was.
59:50
And it was interdisciplinary.
59:53
The botanist that went on the trip, actually ended up
59:57
working at the Andrews Forest.
1:00:00
And it was sort of through that connection that was part of the
1:00:03
-- What was his name?
1:00:05
Larry Pike and Bill Copeland, and Larry was a lichen guy.
1:00:11
He did a Ph.D. at the U of O on lichens.
1:00:16
And it was, that was part of the way that I found my way to the Andrews.
1:00:20
But part of it was via the Galapagos.
1:00:25
The Galapagos was a wonderful, mind-blowing experience.
1:00:33
And I could see why Darwin's mind was blown.
1:00:36
Had you read Darwin before you went?
1:00:39
I took some books, did do some reading in The Voyage of the
1:00:43
Beagle, as I am doing now for the work that Julia and I are doing.
1:00:50
Are you talking about his notes from South America.
1:00:52
Correct?
1:00:53
Exactly.
1:00:53
And we're going to some of the same places.
1:00:56
You mean, the places where he found fossils at 14,000 feet that made him
1:01:01
start to realize that the precepts of uniformitarian geology and, shall
1:01:06
we say, historicizing the biological sciences, there was something to this?
1:01:11
Right.
1:01:11
We did not go to that place, but we did experience some of the weather
1:01:16
on Chiloe Island and places like that, that he was talking about.
1:01:19
Right.
1:01:20
And most of our trips, and we're about to embark on Trip No.
1:01:24
6, most of them have taken us to Chaiten, the volcano that erupted in 2008, which
1:01:29
is just across a big bay from Chiloe.
1:01:35
Is that close to Volcan Osorno?
1:01:38
Osorno is very close to the second volcano that we're working on, Cordon Caulle
1:01:45
Puyehue, which is immediately to the east.
1:01:47
And it began erupting, I think it was 2010 or '11.
1:01:55
And so there, we're studying an ashed forest along the
1:02:02
highway that crosses the Andes.
1:02:07
By the way, fascinating segue.
1:02:09
I really enjoyed that.
1:02:10
Now, regarding the question that I asked you and you focused on geology,
1:02:16
take the same question and apply it to ecosystems science and systems theories?
1:02:21
Oh, right, right.
1:02:22
You were talking about the Odums and you were telling me that even
1:02:26
at this early age, even though you were in a geology track, you were
1:02:29
already thinking about what became your career, an interdisciplinary
1:02:34
geologist/ecosystems scientist.
1:02:37
So, go back to that point.
1:02:41
Right.
1:02:41
So, the trip to the Galapagos, which was sort of mid or latter part of the
1:02:49
middle-third of my Ph.D. program time at the U of O, the Galapagos included
1:02:55
those plant ecologists, and I was interacting and hanging out with plant
1:02:59
ecologists, and also, the Professor, Stan Cook, at the U of O, and sitting in on
1:03:09
some of his class and getting exposed to the Odum's thinking, and there was
1:03:14
some nice review, overview papers, I remember, in science and getting the
1:03:20
bigger pictures of systems ecology.
1:03:25
And also, I was sort of a TA, a teaching assistant, for a course
1:03:35
that was given through the geology department for undergrads, a certain
1:03:41
general course about environmental issues and human population growth,
1:03:47
and taking care of the environment.
1:03:49
This is the earliest '70s, when, leading up to the Clean Water
1:03:54
Act and the Clean Air Act and
1:03:58
similar laws, NEPA, and so forth.
1:03:59
So, there was a lot of foment on those topics and a lot of interest in them.
1:04:06
And I remember a little bit of activism on my part.
1:04:10
Another geology guy and I went up and mapped and did some other investigation
1:04:15
of Rock Mesa, which is a large pumice-covered dome that's only a couple
1:04:22
thousand years old on the south flank of South Sister in a wilderness area,
1:04:27
but there were mining claims on it.
1:04:28
And there was a mining company that wanted to extract pumice for
1:04:34
kitty litter in a wilderness area.
1:04:38
So, we did sort of a technical take on it and wrote a report
1:04:44
about it, although we weren't on the streets as some others were,
1:04:53
protesting issues or advocating for, the French Pete addition to the Three
1:04:59
Sisters Wilderness, things of that nature.
1:05:01
It is interesting as very much of an aside.
1:05:04
There was another guy living in Eugene at that time, Fred
1:05:09
Swanson, Frederick H. Swanson.
1:05:12
I'm Frederick J. I went over to Utah earlier this year and gave a
1:05:18
couple talks, including about our arts-humanities connection with ecological
1:05:23
sciences, and Fred Swanson showed up.
1:05:26
And it was good to reconnect with him.
1:05:29
He had been an activist for the Sierra Club in the earliest '70s in Eugene.
1:05:35
So, every now and then, I get this reaction from a professor after Fred H.
1:05:40
had appeared in the newspapers, saying, "Aren't we giving you enough to do here?"
1:05:45
I guess, they thought we were one
1:05:48
and the same.
1:05:49
[Break in audio]
1:05:49
We're back on.
1:05:51
So, anyway, I was getting exposed to ecological and environmental issues as a
1:06:00
Ph.D. student, but it wasn't central to my focus.
1:06:05
So, some of these ecosystems science ideas, do you remember that they were
1:06:08
more just like loose-formed ideas that kind of grew gradually, infiltrating
1:06:14
into your [mind] , you didn't become a student of a particular school?
1:06:20
There were just a general set of ideas that were informing your
1:06:23
interdisciplinary perspective on science?
1:06:27
I think that's true that I was assimilating by quite active osmosis.
1:06:36
So, you were an inductive learner more than a deductive learner, in a sense?
1:06:41
Oh, very much so.
1:06:42
I just started to just make my way along with things.
1:06:50
You know, when I retired, having done all of this work that was highly
1:06:54
relevant to ecology and soil science
1:06:59
and other things, including biogeochemistry, but not having really
1:07:02
any formal training of any significance in any of them, I always sort of felt
1:07:07
like, "Wow, I made retirement. I faked them all out for all those years."
1:07:18
But a key point is
1:07:24
my very good friend, Jim Sedell, who I met when I started
1:07:27
working at the Andrews in 1972.
1:07:30
And he was a part of our cohort of about half a dozen post-docs, which was
1:07:35
a critical feature of the way IBP, the Coniferous Forest Biome part of IBP at the
1:07:44
Andrews and out of the Corvallis scene.
1:07:48
That was a critical part that we had all those post-docs, which was very
1:07:51
distinctive from the dominant mode up at the University of Washington, the other
1:07:56
center of the Coniferous Forest Biome.
1:08:00
They were dominated by established old professors who would interact only as much
1:08:05
as necessary to keep their share of the dollars flowing, whereas down here, we
1:08:10
had these people at the post-doc stage.
1:08:13
And we had some people with cool personalities and we could really click.
1:08:19
So anyway, Jim had a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Willamette University.
1:08:29
A year ago this summer, last summer, the summer of 2012, he was dying of cancer.
1:08:36
Stan Gregory and I went and did some interviewing in his living room,
1:08:45
and Stan was recording it on his tablet, but rather surreptitiously.
1:08:52
So, we were very uninhibited in our conversation.
1:08:55
We wanted to check out,
1:08:59
confirm things with Jim as to our shared histories and his personal history.
1:09:06
And so, at one point we said, "Well, what's the significance
1:09:10
of you having an undergraduate degree in philosophy?" He sort of
1:09:18
muttered, "Well, I wasn't trained."
1:09:25
And my reaction was, "Yeah, you mean, you weren't constrained, you'd not been
1:09:32
taught how to think about a lot of the ecological things that you got into."
1:09:38
And Jim was well-known for wild thinking, there would, could be, sort of a blizzard.
1:09:46
And if you were somebody who worked for him, you couldn't try to pick up
1:09:49
on every thread, because here comes the next one and then the next one.
1:09:54
But some of his ideas were extremely critical.
1:09:57
In fact, the whole engagement of humanities and increasingly the arts in
1:10:02
the Andrews program, which is now rippling out across twenty other sites of long-term
1:10:08
inquiry that was really nucleated and kicked off by Jim back in about 2002.
1:10:19
So, anyway, I
1:10:22
think it pertained to me and it pertained to Jim and others in our group that
1:10:28
we could roam free in our thinking.
1:10:34
And we tried to play by a lot of the rules, but we also wanted to be open
1:10:39
to let interesting things happen.
1:10:45
How do you think that this happens to different people in science?
1:10:51
Because you get certain people that, boy, they grab onto a paradigm that
1:10:56
makes their career, and they'll fight to protect it to the death.
1:11:01
But then you get other people who just kind of just weave their
1:11:05
way through ideas and things and beliefs and different publications,
1:11:10
and this career segue and tangent.
1:11:13
How do you think that comes to be?
1:11:14
I mean, that's just a general philosophical question, but since
1:11:18
we're speaking about that issue, I'd like to get your answer on it?
1:11:24
That question has a bunch of dimensions and I haven't really
1:11:28
masticated the question very well.
1:11:33
But I think there's clearly a personality dimension.
1:11:40
Some people want things very prescribed and just to follow the rules and
1:11:49
taking each little step one at a time.
1:11:52
And other people operate by leaps of imagination and
1:11:58
unlikely connection-making.
1:12:01
So, I think there's just this personality dimension.
1:12:04
A second factor is how well, how much opportunity does an individual
1:12:12
have to express either of those or other instincts that they may have.
1:12:20
Their setting may constrain them a great deal.
1:12:22
They may be in a setting that is very inappropriate for their
1:12:27
instincts, and that could be painful.
1:12:30
I can see that now in some of the LTER 7 proposal planning where there
1:12:37
are periods when the thinking needs to be very broad, and there are some
1:12:40
people who just don't operate that way.
1:12:45
And so, it makes for a challenge in group management where
1:12:50
you're trying to do teamwork.
1:12:52
You have to recognize that not everybody is going to perform the same way,
1:12:58
and you have to find a way to benefit from the diversity within the team.
1:13:01
I remember the first time I was getting into the IBP group, and there were some
1:13:06
people, including a systems guy, and within the IBP group, and then some other
1:13:16
people who were roaming around campus like Dave Bella, who were free-thinkers,
1:13:21
and he's still roaming around campus.
1:13:23
This is OSU?
1:13:25
OSU.
1:13:25
Okay.
1:13:27
People who were thinking about, dynamics of group work and what it takes.
1:13:33
The follow-through people, and there's these leap-of-faith idea
1:13:36
people, and everything between.
1:13:39
Another thing that point brings to mind is something that is manifest
1:13:49
in our Andrews Forest program "history timeline." And that is,
1:14:00
and I didn't realize it until we started to prepare that figure, and it's a
1:14:04
figure that now is in many forms.
1:14:07
And for the sake of the recording, explain very quickly what the timeline
1:14:11
is, and then go back to your point.
1:14:13
Well, we thought we should develop the notion of the timeline because
1:14:19
this is a map of how things have changed over time in the group.
1:14:25
Other sites have done similar things, and it can be used in web
1:14:28
searching and a variety of other ways.
1:14:31
But basically, it shows time since the inception of the experimental forest
1:14:37
and some stuff that even predates that.
1:14:41
On the horizontal axis are calendar years from 1948 to the present, and
1:14:46
then, there are different bars that cross the timeline to show when different
1:14:53
National Forest people, academics, and Forest Service scientists were involved
1:14:58
in the project, the major leaders, and how they were distributed over time.
1:15:03
Then for each of our research themes, we have dominant themes
1:15:08
like vegetation studies, hydrology, small watersheds, wildlife
1:15:16
biodiversity, other topics like that.
1:15:18
And in most of those topics, we have a persistent measurement
1:15:24
program - on vegetation plots, stream gauging stations, climate stations.
1:15:33
But for each one of those persistent topics, the issues of the day, the issue
1:15:40
du jour, switches every 5 or 10 years.
1:15:44
And the point there is that we need to be attentive to the issue of the day,
1:15:53
as well as attentive to, exercising the maniacal persistence of keeping
1:15:59
the measurements program going.
1:16:01
It's a very challenging type of program to run because you
1:16:04
have these two complementary, but also competing instincts.
1:16:09
And often, you have to be displaying the relevance to the issues of the
1:16:14
day, over the long-term record, to help keep the long-term record going.
1:16:21
And you have to be milking the long-term record to continuously display its
1:16:25
significance, so you keep that going.
1:16:29
So, that's other dimension of dealing with these different types of personalities
1:16:34
at both the individual level, at the team level, and in the whole program.
1:16:41
Going back.
1:16:42
What thought or image did the term ecology or forwarding that to ecological
1:16:48
science, elicit when you first heard it during your youth and higher education,
1:16:54
and how has that evolved over time?
1:16:57
Well, I think I didn't tap in on the notion of ecology
1:17:02
significantly, until the grad
1:17:08
student time.
1:17:09
And that was in the ways I described earlier of starting to hang with some
1:17:13
of the ecologists, wanting to include some ecologists in the proposal
1:17:17
for that Galapagos project, because it needed to be interdisciplinary.
1:17:22
And probably, the geology work, the geologic mapping and the volcanology,
1:17:28
and, excuse me, the seismology, probably wasn't adequately interdisciplinary.
1:17:35
But through reasons I don't remember exactly how I connected with Larry
1:17:40
Pike and Bill Copeland, it might have been through the teaching assistantship
1:17:48
for the environmental course, the general undergraduate environmental
1:17:54
course, may have connected me to Stan Cook, and then to those other guys.
1:17:57
So, anyway, that's when I started to learn about ecology and then I could
1:18:03
connect it back to the Bermuda experience.
1:18:07
But that had more of a sea water chemistry and sediment angle, and I
1:18:13
wasn't exposed to it as an ecosystem question in that Bermuda experience.
1:18:20
But that was sort of also seeding this interdisciplinarity.
1:18:24
Now, did you see ecology or do you believe that ecology at that time for
1:18:29
you was a scientific and descriptive term, or do you believe it also had,
1:18:35
shall we say, culturally loaded, what we call, a "green" meaning?
1:18:37
I
1:18:42
mean, we're going back forty years or more, but what is your sense
1:18:45
of how you perceived the word, the term, the meaning, its place?
1:18:51
I don't remember trying to make a sharp distinction.
1:18:55
And I do think it's a critical issue to make a clear distinction.
1:18:58
And I'm faced with a writing project right now where I need to do that.
1:19:02
But I think I perceived it in both senses that there was science, a science
1:19:11
of ecology, but also that was highly relevant to these environmental issues
1:19:19
which were being duked out in the marketplace, public marketplace of ideas.
1:19:26
Now, how would you characterize your environmental ethic and philosophy at the,
1:19:32
shall we say, early stage of your career?
1:19:35
Let's call that your graduate student, post-doc transition IBP era.
1:19:40
How would you describe it today?
1:19:42
I mean, we rarely think of our philosophy and ethic when we're in the moment.
1:19:47
It's always done reflectively.
1:19:48
But still, how would you characterize that today?
1:19:55
And that's a very interesting question.
1:20:02
As I mentioned when I was a graduate student, I was doing some teaching
1:20:09
assistant function, discussion group leader around readings
1:20:16
for environmental, an environmental class.
1:20:22
And I remember it as being very Eugene, you know, calling attention to
1:20:29
the plight of the environment at the hands of human-fostered development.
1:20:36
It was back when environmental studies were very much viewed as the environment
1:20:42
as being victimized, and a passive actor.
1:20:45
Right?
1:20:45
Right.
1:20:46
So, it's interesting to me, though, to reflect like on that Rock Mesa case
1:20:52
where I and my buddy, Doug Stoesser, another grad student, went and tried
1:20:59
to do a scientifically credible assessment of Rock Mesa's pumice blanket.
1:21:12
How much might be there, what quality is it, how many crystalline
1:21:17
phenocrysts are in it which might disrupt its properties to function as
1:21:22
a clean pumice, and stuff like that.
1:21:25
So, we were trying to be scientists, behave as scientists, and rather than
1:21:33
really being out there with the banners on the street or the fire bombs.
1:21:40
Actually,
1:21:45
that's something that I carried on through the whole rest of my career,
1:21:52
and the issue is still a hot one.
1:21:54
What is the nature of advocacy by scientists?
1:21:57
And there's a seminar series on campus this term on this topic.
1:22:03
I wrote my opinion in a collection of opinions about that issue of
1:22:11
advocacy by scientists, and I guess we'll get to that later.
1:22:15
But I can see that my performance in some of those early experiences
1:22:21
ended up being consistent with my performances throughout my whole career.
1:22:30
[Break in audio]
1:22:30
Once I began working, after graduation in the Andrews in the context of the
1:22:39
International Biological Program, one of the first things I published on was the
1:22:47
effects of forest roads and logging on
1:22:52
landslides, which was very much in the public eye and a hot issue.
1:22:57
So, I did find that my work was relevant to society, and how I conducted myself
1:23:09
within that context was very important.
1:23:13
And as I learned, there are many points-of-view out there
1:23:19
and you just do your work.
1:23:20
You put the ideas out, and let the chips fall where they may.
1:23:26
But going back a little bit further, recasting that question
1:23:30
before we took that short break.
1:23:31
In terms of ethics and philosophy, environmental ethics and philosophy, for
1:23:38
whatever reasons, you would have probably never become an economic geologist,
1:23:43
for instance, which is essentially is an engineer with geology skills.
1:23:49
You were destined, for whatever reasons, to something else?
1:23:54
Exactly.
1:23:57
I've written about some of this relative to forestry issues, and I
1:24:03
think we can see it in the history of approaches to forest land management
1:24:11
in several different world views and value systems.
1:24:17
There's the agricultural world view.
1:24:20
We'll convert these native forests to plantation.
1:24:25
The crop, yeah.
1:24:26
Sort of like Douglas-fir plantations we're like draping like corn fields over
1:24:31
this complex, steep, unstable landscape.
1:24:36
A second world-view is a species conservation world view of conservation
1:24:42
biology, and your approach to land management, forest land management, then
1:24:47
is based on your perception of the habitat requirements of one or a few species.
1:24:56
Then then a third world-view, which is the one that I feel most comfortable
1:25:03
with, is one we'll call ecosystem dynamics, and that is nature banged
1:25:12
up these ecosystems periodically with wind and fire and landslides.
1:25:17
If we can manage them in some emulation of the natural disturbance regime, it
1:25:24
will probably provide habitat for the species that we know about and all those
1:25:30
that we don't know about, the native species, in the sense that native implies
1:25:37
that these species have resided in this landscape probably for thousands of
1:25:41
years, at least pre-Euro, into pre-Euro time, and that they had lived and were
1:25:49
adapted to that disturbance regime.
1:25:53
So those are three very different world views, and I'm of the third color.
1:26:00
We have people with those different world views reside in different
1:26:05
scientific societies and different departments on campuses and in
1:26:09
federal research organizations, and these are different cultures.
1:26:19
Now, I'm going to segue off to something you just said that's a
1:26:22
little bit ahead in our question list.
1:26:24
How have your views about the ethical responsibilities of the scientist and
1:26:29
science evolved over time towards society and the "non-human" natural world?
1:26:41
Well, I've had a long string of experiences in my career where the
1:26:48
subject matter that I've pursued has been of public interest,
1:26:58
from the mining of Rock Mesa, to effects of forest practices on watersheds and
1:27:10
ecosystems, to how do we understand the eruption of Mount St. Helens and its
1:27:19
ecological and watershed consequences.
1:27:22
And then more recently, to why we should engage philosophers and
1:27:31
creative writers and artists in these places of long-term inquiry.
1:27:36
So, I feel like
1:27:43
I've grown to increasingly feel that storytelling is what it's all about.
1:27:53
Stories can be inspired by science.
1:27:56
But as somebody who has had the good fortune in a way to be able to facilitate
1:28:05
the engagement of people from other, from many disciplines, many world views,
1:28:14
into these places like the Andrews and Mount St. Helens, to go visit these
1:28:18
teachers, to feed them some perspectives from the stories that I've been able
1:28:27
to learn through my own presence there or that people have told me on our
1:28:34
many trips to these places, but also just to help provide opportunity for
1:28:41
these people to go there and do their thing their way with their tools,
1:28:46
and tell their stories their ways,
1:28:52
that's been a really fun and rewarding way to operate.
1:28:58
Do you see the irony in how you, a person who is a scientist who has done much of
1:29:05
his work based on quantitative analysis, that you're advocating narrative?
1:29:13
Well, it's interesting.
1:29:16
For a while, I was quite interested in math and analysis of lots of
1:29:22
data in my Ph.D. work, on gravel shapes and sizes in a river.
1:29:28
I measured the orthogonal three axes of thousands of pebbles,
1:29:40
and played around with them in the primitive computing capabilities that
1:29:44
we had at that time where you had to take boxes of cards down to the computer
1:29:50
center, have it run your program, only to go retrieve them, and be told
1:29:56
there was a bug in there somewhere.
1:29:59
But anyway,
1:30:03
it's been most natural for me to not do things by really crunching the numbers.
1:30:10
If you've got numbers, it's fun and important to crunch them, because often
1:30:15
there will be surprises in the numbers.
1:30:18
And I live with Julia Jones, who is great at number-crunching, and loves
1:30:24
working with big spreadsheets of, for example, 60 years of stream-flow data,
1:30:28
or climate temperature data or something.
1:30:32
That's her narrative.
1:30:34
Yeah.
1:30:36
And so, I'm much more "loosey-goosey."
1:30:47
Right, got you.
1:30:49
Speaking of a question related to, okay,
1:30:55
describe how scientific technology has improved at the Andrews.
1:30:59
Oh, you know what, time out.
1:31:01
[Break in audio]
1:31:02
When and how did you first hear about the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:31:11
Well, that's an interesting story.
1:31:13
I was helping a friend who was doing a master's thesis on some geologic mapping
1:31:18
in southern Oregon in the Tiller area on
1:31:25
the South Umpqua.
1:31:25
We were staying at a guard station and it had a barn where there
1:31:29
used to be pack animals, and it's in the Umpqua National Forest.
1:31:37
A guy came up and we visited with him, and it turned out to
1:31:40
be Jack Rothacher, who was a PNW hydrologist based out of Corvallis.
1:31:46
At that time, there was the team up here in Corvallis that was running a set of
1:31:55
experimental watersheds called Coyote Creek Experimental Watersheds, part of
1:32:01
the South Umpqua Experimental Forest.
1:32:05
He told me about that, and he told me about the Andrews.
1:32:08
That was 1968, summer of '68, and then he sent me a publication about
1:32:15
it because I expressed some interest.
1:32:21
The publication was about Watersheds 1, 2 and 3 in the Andrews.
1:32:25
I read that and was intrigued.
1:32:29
And then it wasn't until four years later
1:32:37
that I connected with the Andrews and began to work there, partly connecting
1:32:44
through Larry Pike and Bill Copeland, and a professor at U of O named Alan Kayes who
1:32:54
had a small contract to map the geology of the Andrews Forest, which was a project
1:33:01
that Mike James, actually a master's student, and I worked on together.
1:33:08
So, that's how I learned about the Andrews.
1:33:11
Now, at that time, what did you know about experimental forests
1:33:16
and long-term ecological research?
1:33:19
I didn't know anything at all.
1:33:26
What were your first impressions of the region around the Andrews
1:33:30
and the Lookout Creek Watershed?
1:33:32
And you can address that ecologically, geologically, aesthetically,
1:33:36
culturally, however you want to answer?
1:33:40
Well, I remember going up there in March with some friends, some acquaintances.
1:33:46
I think it was March, in the early spring of
1:33:53
'72, anticipating some
1:33:56
of this geologic mapping later that year, and I remember hiking up those
1:34:04
long strip-cuts in the uppermost Lookout Creek area, and getting up on the ridge.
1:34:11
And it was a warm, sunny day.
1:34:13
I remember, we took our shirts off although there was a snow
1:34:16
bank we were standing on.
1:34:18
So, anyway, I thought it was a neat place.
1:34:27
It was all covered with forest, so it was clear that it was going to be very
1:34:31
difficult to map the geology because there was so little rock exposure, whereas like
1:34:37
over in Montana and Wyoming where we had our field course, for example, there was
1:34:41
a lot of beautiful exposure of the rock.
1:34:46
So, your first impression was pleasant, but not overwhelming?
1:34:54
In other words, you didn't have any inkling that this was going
1:34:56
to be a place that where your career was going to be centered at?
1:35:00
I did not have any inkling that I would still be working there
1:35:05
more than forty years later.
1:35:07
I'd been out in the Coast Range and other parts of the Cascades,
1:35:14
climbed in some of the Cascades in the Three Sisters area, and Hood,
1:35:23
and down at Shasta, and done teaching summer field camp down out of
1:35:31
Ashland up in the Mt. Ashland area.
1:35:33
So, I'd been up, out and about in Oregon.
1:35:42
I didn't have an inkling that it was going to become so important to me.
1:35:47
Now, regarding your first impressions of what it looked like, the ecology,
1:35:51
tree-covered geology, things like that,
1:35:56
and this is especially looking back at when the Andrews did not have,
1:36:00
shall we say, the cultural and scientific cachet that it does today.
1:36:06
I mean, it was a well-known experimental forest in that context at the
1:36:10
time, but nothing like it is today.
1:36:12
It was just another watershed in the beautiful Cascades, but
1:36:19
nonetheless, it wasn't the "Andrews."
1:36:22
Right.
1:36:22
Like we know it was today, you understand?
1:36:24
Oh, certainly.
1:36:25
Yeah, it didn't have any
1:36:31
facilities,
1:36:34
in terms of bunk houses and office space and garage, a shop and so forth.
1:36:40
None of that existed.
1:36:42
The dwellings to stay in were a couple trailers at two different locations.
1:36:48
Where were they back then, in '72?
1:36:50
There was a trailer up the hill on the Blue River Ranger Station Compound.
1:37:00
Where was that exactly, in the Andrews?
1:37:03
Oh, it was
1:37:04
-- Below the Andrews, right?
1:37:06
It was at the Blue River Ranger Station in the town of Blue River.
1:37:10
Okay, right.
1:37:12
And then there was a trailer at a trailer park right next to the
1:37:16
covered bridge in the little community of Rainbow, along the McKenzie.
1:37:22
So, there were no dwellings in the actual watershed that we know today?
1:37:27
Correct.
1:37:28
Was there any like line shacks or temporary dwellings or emergency
1:37:33
shelters, or anything like that up there?
1:37:35
Well, there was a place called Gypsy Camp, and I think some of the forest
1:37:40
ecologists had a teepee in there.
1:37:42
And then it was judged decades later that it was culturally inappropriate to use
1:37:49
the term gypsy, so then it became referred to as "The Camp Formerly Known as Gypsy."
1:37:58
But no, it did not have on-site facilities except for the gauging
1:38:06
stations and the met stations.
1:38:09
And I remember Eric Forsman was living up there for a while, and I think he
1:38:13
had a camper that was off of a pickup.
1:38:19
So, people like Jack Rothacher and Dick Fredriksen and even Roy
1:38:25
[Silen] , and some of those really early people, they stayed down in Blue
1:38:28
River [town] back in the early days.
1:38:29
Right?
1:38:31
Correct.
1:38:32
There were some houses on the Blue River Ranger District compound.
1:38:37
One of them, I think, was a house for PNW Station people, and there was
1:38:46
a small office and space used as a lab for initial processing of water
1:38:53
samples, and those rooms were in the basement of the ranger station.
1:38:58
So, you did have a rudimentary lab then at your disposal?
1:39:03
Yeah, I didn't really register on it because I never used it.
1:39:08
How many roads were into the Andrews at that early time?
1:39:12
Now, we don't want to go back to the '50s and '60s, but when you first
1:39:16
went there, what do you recall?
1:39:18
So, I first went there in '72.
1:39:19
Well,
1:39:24
most of the logging and roading
1:39:29
had been done then.
1:39:32
Most of the roading had already been done, as the deal to set up the Andrews
1:39:38
Forest between the National Forest [Willamette] and the Experiment Station
1:39:44
[PNW] included logging 20 million board-feet a year.
1:39:47
It's documented in the Geier book [Necessary Work, history of
1:39:50
the H.J. Andrews, by Max Geier] and the sources that he used.
1:39:53
And then the logging really tapered off big-time once we
1:40:00
really got going with the ecosystem research, with IBP and then LTER.
1:40:06
So, the main roads were all built, though?
1:40:10
Yeah.
1:40:11
As of '72, it was, most of the existing roading was already in.
1:40:17
Okay.
1:40:18
Now, some of the roads got built later on to special research
1:40:21
sites, little spurs, correct?
1:40:23
Yeah, there was a little bit of that.
1:40:25
Okay.
1:40:27
What do you remember your first job was at the Andrews, your first project?
1:40:34
The first project was to
1:40:36
-- The mapping project?
1:40:37
Map the geology.
1:40:38
Okay.
1:40:39
Mike James and I worked on that.
1:40:42
We had gaps in our mapping area, and we gradually realized that those were
1:40:48
there because we were not seeing bedrock in place, and then gradually we began
1:40:54
to recognize the large earth flows.
1:41:00
We also started mapping
1:41:04
other land forms, for example, valley floor land forms, alluvial fans, and we
1:41:09
started picking up the small landslides.
1:41:14
Ted Dyrness and people working with him, like Fredriksen and Al Levno, had mapped,
1:41:23
had inventoried all the small rapid landslides, debris flows, debris slides,
1:41:30
that occurred in the winter of '64-'65.
1:41:35
And he did a really nice job of looking at how those were distributed with
1:41:43
respect to rock type and soil type and slope steepness, whether they were
1:41:50
from roads, clear-cut areas or forested areas, and if they were from roads,
1:41:58
from cut slopes or fill slopes, and what was the volume of material moved?
1:42:02
This was Ted Dyrness, right?
1:42:03
Yes.
1:42:04
And what was the destination of the material after it had moved.
1:42:09
So, as Mike and I went out and beat the brush, we found other slides, some
1:42:16
of which were probably '64-'65, and some of them were from other years.
1:42:21
So then, we began to compile this record of the small, rapid slides,
1:42:25
as well as doing the mapping of the large, slow-moving landslides
1:42:28
which were generally forest-covered.
1:42:31
So, that led to a '75 paper that I did with Ted, which moved beyond
1:42:37
just that one winter storm [Two parts -- December 1964 and January
1:42:40
1965] to the whole 1950 to 1975 period.
1:42:45
So, that was your first major publication on the Andrews?
1:42:48
Yeah, that was.
1:42:49
In '75, we got several publications out, and that was an important one.
1:42:55
Now, we'll do a little more reminiscing.
1:42:59
Tell me about some of your colleagues?
1:43:01
The folks you met.
1:43:04
Start telling me about the people and start telling me
1:43:07
about some of the stories?
1:43:09
Well, some of the most important people for me were Jerry Franklin and Jim Sedell.
1:43:17
Jerry was our leader.
1:43:19
He was teamed up with Dick Waring.
1:43:22
Dick was a young faculty member at OSU and Jerry was a Forest Service scientist.
1:43:30
It's a little mind-boggling to me to think about how young those
1:43:34
guys were, leading this program.
1:43:38
And Dick and Jerry had very different personalities and emphases.
1:43:48
But Jerry was an important influence on me and I feel like I sort of rode
1:43:55
his coattails for all these years.
1:44:00
And in fact, bring me back to Jerry, but let me tell an anecdote about him.
1:44:08
He teaches a field course that's basically
1:44:15
driving around parts of the West with a group of 20-25 students
1:44:22
from the University of Washington.
1:44:24
In recent years, he's done this with Norm Johnson, so, a lot of
1:44:29
it's about ecology and forestry.
1:44:33
And especially when he's toodling around with Norm, it's about forest
1:44:39
management issues, effects on communities.
1:44:41
He may have community members, rangers, just agency staff and all
1:44:50
kinds of people speak with this group.
1:44:52
He especially likes scientists, so he'll take them to St. Helens and have Charlie
1:44:57
Crisafulli take them out and jazz them up.
1:45:02
He came to the Andrews this year, for example, and had Mark Harmon
1:45:07
and me go out with them and Michael Nelson and a lot of other people.
1:45:14
One time, this might have been 8 or 10 years ago, I remember being out
1:45:19
with this class, and we went up to Carpenter Mountain, the highest point
1:45:23
in the Andrews, at the lookout there.
1:45:27
Jerry told a story, because they were looking out at this landscape and you
1:45:31
could see the patch clear-cutting and some of the roads, and he said, "You
1:45:34
know, when I first came up here in the '50s, there wasn't, you couldn't see
1:45:40
any cuts, you couldn't see any roads.
1:45:44
I remember it was early in the season and I walked up the trail, up towards
1:45:50
the lookout here, and I remember reaching the point of no return.
1:45:54
No return in the sense that if I kept going and I wanted to turn around
1:46:00
and go back, I was going to run out of light and I'd have to sleep out.
1:46:04
So, I knew I was making a commitment to sleep outside by myself, and
1:46:08
I had not been doing that, and I was a little uneasy about it.
1:46:13
But I pushed myself to go out there and do that.
1:46:19
By the end of the summer, I felt real comfortable doing that." And
1:46:24
I said, "You son of a bitch, that's what you did to all the rest of us.
1:46:28
You'd get us out on a limb with some big management idea, or we'd be out with
1:46:34
some politicians or something, and we're just out there stretching beyond their
1:46:38
comfort zone." But look at all the amazing things that happened because of it?" So,
1:46:45
anyway, Jerry's been extremely important in demonstrating storytelling and bringing
1:46:56
people together from many points-of-view.
1:46:59
I remember, both he and Ted Dyrness,
1:47:05
Franklin and Dyrness' book [Natural Vegetation of Oregon and
1:47:08
Washington] , that's from that year, I think it's '72, maybe it's '73.
1:47:11
'73.
1:47:12
'73; and which is still "the book" on natural vegetation
1:47:17
of Oregon and Washington.
1:47:21
They each said to me on separate personal occasions, "You know, I've worked hard to
1:47:27
help bring other people into this place because I wasn't a good enough scientist
1:47:32
myself, just in my own work." There was some humility there, but they worked hard
1:47:41
to facilitate other people coming in.
1:47:45
And so, I adopted that philosophy.
1:47:48
Jerry is extremely important, and look what has happened as a result.
1:47:56
And it's come into quite sharp focus for us.
1:48:01
He and I have talked about it a couple times in the context of memorial
1:48:05
services for Jim Sedell, because
1:48:12
we've really had this amazing team.
1:48:16
It included Jerry and Jim and Stan Gregory and other people, Dave Perry,
1:48:26
and now there's Tom Spies, Julia [Jones] has an important role, and
1:48:32
Sherri's [Johnson] in there now.
1:48:33
She's got a different kind of role than some of these other folks.
1:48:38
And so,
1:48:45
it's just been really amazing this community that has
1:48:49
really moved things along.
1:48:53
So there's Jim, Jim Sedell.
1:48:55
He was extremely influential to me.
1:48:58
I'd been living down in Eugene with my wife at that time, and the dump we were
1:49:06
living in was getting quite sketchy.
1:49:11
This is '75, and Jim invited us
1:49:20
up, Mary and I, up to have dinner with he and Ellen, and then, to
1:49:26
give a talk to the stream team.
1:49:30
I had done this job down on the Elk Sixes River country where I looked at
1:49:34
the geology and geomorphology, and then forest ownership patterns which directly
1:49:40
tracked the geology and topography, which then influenced the fish habitat, and Jim
1:49:47
just loved those big arm-wavy stories.
1:49:51
So, actually, that visit and the welcoming he gave us, induced us to move up here
1:50:02
-- To Corvallis?
1:50:02
To Corvallis, and to integrate into the community more thoroughly.
1:50:07
The very important thing there, was that the IBP era made it possible to
1:50:13
bring a cadre of post-docs together, and permit them to synergize over
1:50:19
multiple years and learn to communicate and to develop friendships, and
1:50:23
really do the interdisciplinary work.
1:50:26
Certain themes like old growth, and especially dead wood, dead
1:50:33
wood in streams, these were points of interdisciplinary nucleation.
1:50:40
And this is even before Mark Harmon was in the picture, right?
1:50:43
Yeah.
1:50:44
So, this was
1:50:45
-- Long before.
1:50:46
You know, the '70s, mid-'70s.
1:50:50
All three of our disciplines, forest ecology, stream ecology and geomorphology,
1:50:54
had pretty much ignored deadwood, and in order to tell the stream deadwood
1:51:01
story, we needed to understand forest dynamics, and we needed to
1:51:06
understand stream ecosystems, and we needed to understand geomorphology.
1:51:14
Anyway, that was really critical.
1:51:17
So, when Mount St. Helens erupted, we were all ready to go with Jerry,
1:51:21
Jim and me and a lot of other people, because we had this interdisciplinary
1:51:28
concept, vocabulary, and especially, community, that was ready to rumble.
1:51:35
Now, we're going to return to the St. Helens subject a little
1:51:37
bit later in more detail.
1:51:39
But I want maybe to have you share a little more about some of the people,
1:51:42
Jack Rothacher, Ted Dyrness, Dick Fredriksen, some of those early people
1:51:47
[HJA] that you still overlapped with.
1:51:48
Maybe some of them were in their later years with the Forest Service or as
1:51:52
research scientists, but maybe fill in the gaps with a little more personal details?
1:51:58
Right.
1:51:59
And I really hand it
1:52:03
to Fredriksen and Rothacher and Al Levno and
1:52:13
some of those other people, because they were Forest Service
1:52:18
scientists and technicians.
1:52:21
And a guy like Dick Fredriksen was a technician for a long time, and then,
1:52:26
he went and got a Ph.D. along the way.
1:52:29
In forestry or in biology?
1:52:33
I think it was in forest science or forestry, and it [dissertation]
1:52:38
had to do with water quality for some of the experimental watersheds.
1:52:48
Anyway, the key thing was that they did with grace and openness, to accept
1:52:55
the arrival of these shaggy post-docs and other workers up there, who came in
1:53:07
from other kinds of cultures and started working at the Forest [HJA] , even in
1:53:15
the very places where they'd been doing the setup work, like Watershed 10.
1:53:21
And they could have resented that, but they were very welcoming.
1:53:26
Because they were more old-school guys, right?
1:53:29
Yeah.
1:53:29
And you guys were, for lack of a better term, "hippy scientists"?
1:53:35
You could probably say that.
1:53:37
When you look at the black-and-white photos, some of which are in the
1:53:41
Max Geier book, it's pretty shaggy.
1:53:45
Well, it's the '70s, the early '70s.
1:53:47
Yeah, it was the '70s.
1:53:48
We were in the '70s.
1:53:50
And so,
1:53:53
that was really nice of them.
1:53:56
Then Ted Dyrness, in particular, he was a soils guy.
1:54:00
He was an earth scientist and was very helpful to me, to
1:54:06
help me be able to integrate.
1:54:09
That was the benefit of IBP and being able to hire some people, so people with
1:54:14
unlikely, sort of tangential or peripheral disciplines, were given the time to find
1:54:24
-- To find your place?
1:54:24
Find a place.
1:54:25
Yeah.
1:54:26
And that would be hard to accomplish today.
1:54:31
Those kinds of things, I don't think are happening very frequently.
1:54:35
Now, tell me a little about Jack Rothacher?
1:54:38
Oh, I didn't know him very well, but he was a nice guy.
1:54:45
He lived out in Woods Creek on the flanks of Mary's Peak.
1:54:50
And
1:54:54
he, I think, was the project leader at that time, the leader of the little
1:54:59
Forest Service Watershed Unit that ran experimental watersheds at Andrews,
1:55:04
multiple experimental watersheds there, watershed sets, and then also the
1:55:10
Coyote Creek down on the Umpqua National Forest, and Fox Creek up on the Bull Run
1:55:16
in the Mt. Hood National Forest, which is, Bull Run is the
1:55:20
municipal watershed for Portland.
1:55:24
So, this work was really important.
1:55:26
What are the effects of forest practices on flows, stream flow, peak flows, low
1:55:31
flows, water yield, and water quality.
1:55:35
So, that's what those guys were into and they went to these watersheds on
1:55:41
a regular basis and maintained things.
1:55:44
So, Dick Fredriksen took me out on several occasions to
1:55:48
some of these other locations.
1:55:53
Also, there was Doug Swanston, and we have some papers, "Swanston and Swanson,"
1:55:58
and "Swanson and Swanston." He was a geologist here who had come down from
1:56:03
Alaska, and we did some projects such as mapping the land forms and the erosion
1:56:11
processes operating in places like
1:56:15
Lookout Creek, earth flows in the Andrews, and the experimental watersheds, the
1:56:20
Coyote Creek Experimental Watersheds.
1:56:22
Didn't you also do some work in the Middle Santiam area, too?
1:56:25
Yes, and we weren't just operating only in these experimental watersheds.
1:56:32
I had students who were out doing landslide analysis mapping and
1:56:37
so forth, in multiple places.
1:56:42
Because on the one hand, we paid sustained attention to some places,
1:56:49
but also, we needed to go out and test ideas in other parts of the world.
1:56:55
So we did that regionally, including in the Coast Range, as well as the Cascades.
1:57:04
And my Elk River Ph.D. dissertation work was done in the Klamath Mountains.
1:57:12
So, each of these mountain types have different geomorphic stories and different
1:57:19
interactions with forest practices.
1:57:21
But then, the LTER, Long-Term Ecological Research program, has given us the
1:57:26
opportunity to go and interact with other sites around the country.
1:57:30
So, I've been very involved with, at times, with Luquillo [Puerto
1:57:33
Rico LTER] and Harvard Forest [LTER] , and a few of the others.
1:57:37
Going back again to the early days; anecdotes, stories, humor, bizarre, to the
1:57:44
culture, I mean, tell me some fun stories.
1:57:48
There must have been some things, some knee-slappers, or things that you remember
1:57:54
that you guys, if you get together, some of them are still not around, but you'd
1:57:58
say, "Do you remember that time?" And you'd all enjoy, big, roaring laugh?
1:58:03
Well, the person to ask that question of is Stan because he's a trickster, and
1:58:10
he has some great stories about drinking and going out with Jim, and then, Bob
1:58:18
Wissmar from the University of Washington.
1:58:22
So,
1:58:30
I wasn't socializing a whole lot in that kind of way.
1:58:36
But even, not necessarily "party stories," but just stories about the culture of
1:58:41
science and the logistics of being out there, and whether it be the winter
1:58:46
or whatever time, during the floods.
1:58:48
Any stories, especially in the early days, though, that were interesting, memorable?
1:58:55
Well, a story, one story and I actually wrote a little blurb about it, that's in
1:59:01
a book about old stories of Forest Service personnel that my buddy, Rolf Anderson,
1:59:10
who is now retired from the Willamette National Forest, and I see in various
1:59:15
ways, including through his role in the McKenzie River Trust, the land trust.
1:59:23
Anyway, I heard the story, and you should ask Al Levno about
1:59:29
it, about Dick Fredriksen and Al being out during the '64 flood.
1:59:37
Al had these really thick, sort of like bottoms of Coke bottle glasses, and his
1:59:43
glasses were fogging up all the time and he could barely see, and Dick sometimes
1:59:47
had to hold him by the hand to lead him.
1:59:50
And then, the storm was raging and there were big debris flows
1:59:56
coming down Watershed 3 and piling big rafts of logs up on the road.
2:00:02
There's an interesting photo of a big pile of logs,
2:00:08
the road off of Watershed 3, in a little report that Dick Fredriksen wrote about
2:00:14
that storm and the associated landslides.
2:00:18
Loggers got up on top of one of the piles and started bucking up the logs,
2:00:23
and were trying to get up to a logging operation where they had equipment up
2:00:28
in the watershed, and get back to work.
2:00:31
And then they heard this big rumble and the snapping of trees, as the
2:00:34
next big debris flow came down.
2:00:36
They hopped off the pile they'd been working on and the next big wad of
2:00:40
logs came down in this debris flow and it banged into one they worked
2:00:44
on, shoved that first pile into Lookout Creek and left a fresh one.
2:00:50
And they decided to give up for the day.
2:00:52
In other words, they might have been killed if they were on those?
2:00:54
Oh, yeah.
2:00:55
So, then Al and
2:01:00
Dick had to wander their way out in a real round-about way, and they got down to the
2:01:06
McKenzie Valley floor and it was in flood.
2:01:09
They sort of waded their way down to a house a little bit downstream.
2:01:15
Well, then in '96,
2:01:19
this was right after
2:01:22
the government shutdown.
2:01:25
[1996 flood - to compare with 1964 flood]
2:01:26
. Sequestration's a later word.
2:01:30
The government shutdown, orchestrated by the Gingrich Congress which
2:01:37
had a "contract on America."
2:01:40
Oh, it's "with" America.
2:01:41
I know.
2:01:42
No, it was on America.
2:01:42
[Laughs]
2:01:43
I know, I understand the joke.
2:01:45
So, actually, that was really good for me because I was Principal Investigator
2:01:50
of the LTER project at that time, and we were trying to write our renewal proposal,
2:01:55
six years, for umpteen million dollars.
2:01:58
So, I liked having my day job as a Forest Service scientist go away
2:02:02
so I could focus on this other job.
2:02:05
But then, we got it in.
2:02:07
It had been in for only a couple days, and I think it was
2:02:10
like February 2, it was due.
2:02:13
And then Gordon Grant comes by and says, "Hey, I looked on the web.
2:02:18
I can see that we've got a lot of snow up high.
2:02:22
And I see the hydrograph on the McKenzie screaming upward, and I think, here
2:02:29
comes a 'Pineapple Express' from Hawaii, a warm, wet, intense storm.
2:02:35
And I think we're going to have a good frog-strangler of a flood here.
2:02:39
Let's get out there." So, we picked up a few other people, including Beverley
2:02:45
Wemple, a student of Julia's who was working on road hydrology at the
2:02:50
time, and had instruments out there for measuring the hydrograph, and
2:02:55
the water flowing through culverts.
2:03:00
We went up there and spent several days during that storm, and it was
2:03:03
extremely exciting and interesting.
2:03:06
Gordon brought a video camera and took about 25 minutes of video at
2:03:10
several places, including along Lookout Creek and the bridge over the mouth
2:03:15
of Lookout Creek and the Watershed 3 mouth, which had been reamed out
2:03:23
somewhat like had happened in the '64 flood.
2:03:27
The gauging station had been wasted in '64 and in '96.
2:03:35
We saw some big logs floating down the creek, Gordon's video-ing it, and we're
2:03:40
there saying, "Oh, rip city! Hey, look, it's an aircraft carrier!" [Laughs] For
2:03:46
these big logs coming down the creek.
2:03:48
How did that one compare to the '64 flood from what you know of the evidence?
2:03:52
Obviously, you weren't there in '64, but you've seen the pictures,
2:03:57
you've read the reports, you've talked to the people that were there.
2:04:00
How did it compare in intensity, scope, waterflow, etc.?
2:04:06
To the best that we can reconstruct, it was probably fairly similar.
2:04:14
'96 might have been a touch less in terms of flow.
2:04:23
Our ability to measure discharge in those extreme events is
2:04:28
compromised for various reasons.
2:04:31
But also, the amount of sliding in the forest was similar in '96 and in '64.
2:04:37
The amount of sliding from roads was about half in '96 of what it had been in '64.
2:04:43
But in '64, we had all these freshly-made and in some cases,
2:04:49
poorly-engineered and poorly-placed roads.
2:04:51
And so, when they were reconstructed, and my guess is that they were reconstructed
2:04:57
in somewhat more stable configurations.
2:04:57
And you had culverts go under a lot of places.
2:05:00
Correct?
2:05:00
Yeah.
2:05:02
And there were many fewer slides from plantations because
2:05:13
the young plantations we had in '96 covered very little acreage.
2:05:15
Well,
2:05:18
your early cuts were at least regenerated to some degree by that time, correct?
2:05:23
Yeah, right.
2:05:24
I mean, you didn't have a bunch of bare ground with small
2:05:27
plants and seedlings, right?
2:05:29
Right, and it was really about, what the state of the root strength was probably.
2:05:34
So anyway, there were some interesting similarities, but also there
2:05:40
were some interesting legacies.
2:05:42
For example, in Watershed 3,
2:05:46
there were the big piles of old-growth logs that were flushed out of the multiple
2:05:52
channels within Watershed 3 in '64.
2:05:56
And hence, these big piles including massive old-growth trees.
2:06:01
Well, in '96, the channel hadn't been recharged with very much big wood.
2:06:11
And it had only 30-some years to do that.
2:06:15
And so, most of the wood that came out in '96 was alder that had grown
2:06:22
along the channel since the '64 flood.
2:06:26
And got ripped out?
2:06:27
Yeah, so there were these sort of legacies or shadows of the '64 flood.
2:06:32
What impact did the '96 flood have on any of Mark Harmon's logs?
2:06:38
Mark Harmon's terrestrial log study was all high, not very dry, but high.
2:06:45
So, he escaped most of that then?
2:06:47
Right.
2:06:48
But he did install a stream log decay component that involved something
2:06:56
like ninety logs of alder and Doug Fir that were placed in a reach of
2:07:03
stream where there, the left and right margins of the channel, and then the
2:07:10
center, and then, spaced something like ten meters apart down the channel.
2:07:15
Those logs were marked and then were moved in successive events.
2:07:24
So that was anticipated.
2:07:27
When and how did you begin to feel an attachment to the Andrews?
2:07:33
First, as a natural place, and later to its human community, culture and
2:07:39
activities, science and otherwise.
2:07:43
Well, my work there, partly because I was coming up from Eugene,
2:07:49
because I was a geologist, and just Mike James and I were doing the
2:07:59
geologizing, and then we started mapping the landslides and I got into fire
2:08:07
history, generally, with one other person.
2:08:12
So, I spent a lot of time for multiple study objectives wandering
2:08:19
around a lot of that landscape.
2:08:23
And I really grooved on it.
2:08:25
I just liked going on by myself or with one other person, cruising
2:08:31
across the countryside and trying to puzzle out whatever the puzzles were
2:08:35
that I was working on at the time.
2:08:40
So, I really loved it.
2:08:42
It was
2:08:45
just a great place to go, and I still go there.
2:08:49
And it's full of puzzles and they remain in spite of getting this new
2:08:56
LIDAR imagery that gives us a spatial resolution that we couldn't have imagined.
2:09:04
Kind of like a morphological picture of the tops of things, right?
2:09:09
Well, you get returns from all levels of the forest including the ground return.
2:09:16
So, a Japanese colleague, who a decade ago was here for a year,
2:09:21
he's been coming back for about a month each summer, and we go out.
2:09:27
And we went out this last August.
2:09:30
It was just really fun, and to go out to all these places and
2:09:37
in a sort of landscape immersion, in places where you figure
2:09:40
nobody's been here before.
2:09:44
Now, when did the culture of the Andrews start becoming a more mature culture?
2:09:51
Was that after you started having placed residencies in the
2:09:58
Forest, even when they were in old trailers?
2:10:03
Oh, I think, there are
2:10:09
sort of raucous "out-there guys" like Jim and Stan, and
2:10:15
Jerry, and we'd "goon" Jerry.
2:10:19
Jim would say to Jerry, "Hey, Jer, we're the best thing you got goin'!"
2:10:24
[Referring to "Stream Team"] You know, so there was this sort of gooning.
2:10:27
Yeah?
2:10:28
And camaraderie.
2:10:30
We were trying to put our stories together, and when we had stories
2:10:35
like "Wood and Streams," then we had to bump heads and put it together.
2:10:42
And in a case like that, we weren't competing for territory with one
2:10:48
another, we needed to come together.
2:10:52
Jerry loved stories, and these stories had all these management implications
2:10:59
and he especially loved that, as did Jim.
2:11:03
So, I'd say, in '74-'75, we were
2:11:14
really starting to hum.
2:11:17
And like the "Wood and Streams" story really took off in '75, there
2:11:24
was a big conference, "Logging Debris and Streams" and it was
2:11:31
-- Which is a negative context just because of the terminology, correct?
2:11:36
Yeah, but
2:11:41
this is a critical case.
2:11:44
There's another place in here where you asked about the connection between,
2:11:50
amongst policy management and science.
2:11:54
And there are a number of "aha moments" in my sense of my career.
2:12:08
A common theme to them is they became "aha moments" for scientists, setting us
2:12:17
off on a research course that we had not imagined before, and with an intensity
2:12:25
that we certainly didn't imagine.
2:12:29
But they occurred in the context of interactions with
2:12:35
management and policy people.
2:12:40
The role of wood and streams in the context of dispute over should loggers
2:12:46
be forced to remove wood from streams as part of their logging operations?
2:12:51
That's a long story, and I have some stuff written about that;
2:12:57
"Wood and Streams," and "State Forest Practice Rules." For
2:13:06
example, the question, "Is this a good landscape or a bad landscape?"
2:13:11
Back about 1991, this question led us into using historic disturbance
2:13:18
regimes to plan landscape management;
2:13:22
that's number two.
2:13:27
Number three, is realizing that we needed to consider stream and riparian
2:13:35
and other branching hierarchical networks, the network story in a
2:13:40
way that's fully integrated with the forest vegetation patchwork.
2:13:46
The "aha moment" came in the FEMAT, Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment
2:13:52
Team process, immediately after the President's Forest Summit [Bill Clinton's
2:13:59
1993 meeting in Portland, Oregon to address management of NW forests]
2:14:00
. In the early '90s, correct?
2:14:02
'93. That led directly into the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:14:06
Anyway, there are these different "aha moments." And although we play things up
2:14:11
bigtime in the NSF science realm, they also play policy and management roles.
2:14:23
How was the structure of things back in the IBP days in terms of
2:14:29
the program, who ran what, was it an organized program, was it a little
2:14:36
bit of OSU, a little bit of Forest Service, a little bit of the IBP thing?
2:14:40
How was that working out back then?
2:14:42
Okay, that would be in the '70s.
2:14:48
I was not central because, from '72 to '75, I was in Eugene, and then
2:14:59
I came up here, and gradually got integrated, but my perception was
2:15:05
that Dick and Jerry ran the show.
2:15:09
Then they duked it out with the University of Washington people for bucks.
2:15:17
And it's interesting that Jerry ended up going to the U of W, having been in mortal
2:15:23
combat with them for quite a few years.
2:15:28
Describe the combat.
2:15:29
What do you mean by combat?
2:15:32
A turf, program direction and philosophy, money, all of the above?
2:15:39
Okay, let's remember where I was supposed to go with that on early organization.
2:15:47
And the combat thing was
2:15:52
based on as I understand it, Ted and Jerry were sitting on a stump
2:15:57
saying, in the mid-'60s, "We need to get more people working here or this
2:16:01
place might be disestablished." And so we've got to get some academics.
2:16:09
A little bit later, they were talking; "Hey, there's this
2:16:11
workshop on systems ecology."
2:16:16
"What's that?" "Well, I don't know but maybe that's what we need to do."
2:16:22
So, one of them went to this workshop.
2:16:25
So, that led to getting into, trying to get into IBP.
2:16:31
And so, then there was a competition between the Seattle people and
2:16:37
the Corvallis people to be the Coniferous Forest Biome site.
2:16:41
There was competition amongst them, those two groups, to get NSF-funded.
2:16:51
Then the story goes, and Jerry has told this in places, and you
2:16:56
may have it in your records, that
2:17:00
the NSF said, "Either you guys get it together or there is no Coniferous Forest
2:17:05
Biome." So, that set the stage for this continuing tension to compete for dollars
2:17:12
within the Conifer Forest Biome pot.
2:17:17
What was the location for Washington?
2:17:21
That was not Wind River, or was it somewhere else?
2:17:24
Yes, and that is a critical feature.
2:17:26
Why did the Andrews scene and Corvallis, do what it did, and here we are today?
2:17:36
And why did the Seattle scene, which was at Findley Lake, a fairly high
2:17:43
elevation lake, do what it did?
2:17:44
So, there was a lake component there and there was a stream component here.
2:17:50
At the Cedar River Watershed, which is the municipal watershed for Seattle,
2:17:54
they worked on plantation forests and glacial outwash managed forest,
2:18:01
and we mostly did native forest.
2:18:03
The stream [aquatic] people were highly cooperative.
2:18:06
They're both wet, and one was lakes and one was streams, and they had a
2:18:10
bunch of wild and crazy guys doing it.
2:18:12
And so, when St. Helens operated, and there were lakes and there were stream
2:18:16
issues there, they really came together.
2:18:20
So,
2:18:26
organizationally, my take is that Dick and Jerry ran the [Andrews] show.
2:18:29
This would be in the first half of the '70s.
2:18:32
We all had our little projects, and then, we had to get together periodically,
2:18:41
report out and be subject to NSF site reviews, and write pubs and internal
2:18:47
reports and things of this nature.
2:18:49
We were also pushed hard to take a systems approach to our work, ala an
2:18:56
"Odom-esque" [Howard and Eugene Odum] approach; the way we'll understand
2:19:01
these ecosystems is to define all the stocks and flows, and develop these
2:19:12
"horrendogram" diagrams, which show
2:19:17
how much carbon is stored in bark and fine roots and forest litter and
2:19:23
foliage and so forth, and then, what are the fluxes found in litter fall and
2:19:31
one thing or another.
2:19:34
Do that for carbon and nitrogen and other elements, and water, and then
2:19:42
model it, computer-simulation modeling.
2:19:46
And so, the idea was to have synthesis in the form of large ecosystem models.
2:19:52
I adopted that thinking in trying to think about sediment
2:19:57
budgets and sediment routing.
2:20:00
Some colleagues were doing that; da good buddy, Dick Janda, a U.S.G.S.
2:20:06
guy working in the redwoods in the context of the initial establishment
2:20:12
and later expansion of Redwood National Park, and some other people.
2:20:17
And so, we actually got a little NSF grant and had a workshop on
2:20:22
sediment budgets and routing in forest encashments, here in Corvallis in
2:20:27
about 1979 or something, 1980, then, we published proceedings from it.
2:20:36
I think it was fairly influential in people's thinking about how soil and
2:20:42
sediment moves through watersheds.
2:20:45
My interests were in how it does occur under natural disturbance
2:20:51
regimes like wildfire, the role of root throw in landsides and all.
2:20:55
You certainly can integrate that all into this picture.
2:20:58
And how does it occur under managed disturbance regimes and versus
2:21:05
natural disturbance regimes.
2:21:08
And
2:21:11
so, anyway, what was the question?
2:21:14
We were just going through the IBP era.
2:21:16
Oh, yeah.
2:21:17
And kind of early days transition.
2:21:19
I'm trying to get at what the transition was.
2:21:21
I mean, the IBP obviously petered out for a variety of reasons.
2:21:26
But it was the seed child to what became the LTER, the EER/LTER, right?
2:21:32
Right, right.
2:21:34
So, the succession for us was that IBP died a planned death, and then the EER,
2:21:43
Experimental Ecological Reserve, was it turned out to be, sort of a bridging
2:21:48
grant to keep our core functions.
2:21:52
And there was never actually formal names that used the EER, it was just
2:21:57
an administrative term between the IBP era and the LTER era, correct?
2:22:02
It may have referred to a specific grant, but it was not something,
2:22:10
that as far as I know, was
2:22:14
for the network of IBP sites that would then become candidates for LTER.
2:22:23
How many of the other IBP sites did you know personally or at
2:22:27
least had significant contacts with the people from them?
2:22:35
That is an interesting issue concerning how Forest Service research sites
2:22:48
set the stage to be competitive for IBP, which in turn further set the
2:22:55
stage to be competitive for LTER.
2:22:58
So, the principals, Andrews, Hubbard Brook, Coweeta, the crown jewels.
2:23:07
There are some other sites
2:23:11
that may have had some of that, I am not sure about them, like
2:23:18
Niwot, Shortgrass Steppe, and Pawnee Grasslands, out of Ft. Collins.
2:23:26
In northern Colorado, correct?
2:23:27
Yeah.
2:23:31
Those are some of the principal examples.
2:23:34
Now, what do you remember what the organizing ideas were back then?
2:23:38
It sounded like you and other people were trying to find their way in this
2:23:43
new science, and what does this mean?
2:23:47
How do we define an ecosystem in terms of studying it scientifically, analytically,
2:23:53
in a way that matters beyond, I'm just going to do this study and that study,
2:23:56
and how do we integrate this stuff?
2:23:58
It sounds like people were still trying to put it together,
2:24:04
conceptually.
2:24:04
That's fair.
2:24:05
It's interesting to think about it.
2:24:13
There was this push for a systems approach, defined stocks and flows,
2:24:22
and controls on the valves in various parts of the system, and to move
2:24:27
directly into simulation models.
2:24:30
And that that would constitute understanding ecosystems.
2:24:33
How influential were Likens and the Hubbard Brook people on what
2:24:37
people were thinking back then?
2:24:39
I think they were very influential.
2:24:45
I've just been thinking about that recently.
2:24:51
But
2:24:56
before I go there, let me finish one thought.
2:24:59
Sure.
2:25:00
So, on the one hand, we were pressed to develop these simulation models
2:25:07
and sort of synthesize our knowledge.
2:25:10
And we did, and most, maybe all IBP sites, did produce synthesis volumes, books.
2:25:18
And I think I have the IBP one in here for the Coniferous Forest Biome.
2:25:26
So, there's a narrative synthesis, of sorts, with chapters by
2:25:30
different groups of authors.
2:25:31
Right.
2:25:37
The stuff we did that was most impactful in conservation,
2:25:47
stewardship, and even just thinking about how ecosystems function,
2:25:55
was the deadwood work and the old-growth work, and these things
2:26:00
were not a part of the charge.
2:26:04
In other words, your mission or your directive, if you will, was not that?
2:26:12
Correct.
2:26:12
That came out of what you guys did and happened to do, and thought of and created
2:26:18
out there in the place, the landscape?
2:26:20
Right.
2:26:21
And some of it was quite accidental.
2:26:23
For example, that we happened to be working in old-growth native forest,
2:26:27
rather than, say, mature forest.
2:26:29
We were working a lot in the 500-year-old forest, rather than in
2:26:33
the 120- or 140- [year] age class.
2:26:37
That we happened to be working in old growth, was an accident of that
2:26:40
decision in the mid-'40s to place the Blue River Experimental Forest,
2:26:46
later renamed for H.J. Andrews, on the Lookout Creek Watershed, in part because
2:26:51
it had a bunch of old growth in it.
2:26:53
It was in the municipal watershed of the City of Eugene.
2:26:58
The objective was to develop the forestry, the post-World War II forestry
2:27:02
system, while attending to water quality issues, as directed in the Organic
2:27:09
Act that set up the Forest Service at the turn of the century [th] . All
2:27:12
these things just sort of happened with these funny multi-decade lags.
2:27:20
That we happened to work in old growth, we didn't crystallize that story until
2:27:26
the end of that decade of the '70s.
2:27:30
And then, it didn't move from being pre-relevant, irrelevant or
2:27:34
pre-relevant to being hyper-relevant, for yet another decade.
2:27:37
So that's a major story.
2:27:40
Now, going over to Jerry and old growth, how did Jerry become Jerry,
2:27:46
the "guru," the old-growth guy?
2:27:49
I mean, it's a perfect segue for that right now.
2:27:52
So, kind of go back and segue over to focus on him and that.
2:27:57
Jerry's a guy who, now at year, something like 77, still takes 25
2:28:05
kids out, and he'll do it by himself for a couple-week field trip, sleep
2:28:13
under the bonnet in his pickup truck in the back with his golden
2:28:18
retriever, and get up in the morning and yodel to the trees.
2:28:22
He's a passionate guy.
2:28:25
And he likes telling stories, and he does a good job of it.
2:28:32
He's got stories to tell and he has a lot of friends, who
2:28:37
he chews stories over with.
2:28:41
And
2:28:45
he has a foot in both the forestry world and the ecology world.
2:28:51
He was elected President of the Ecological Society of America.
2:28:55
And he was given a prestigious Barrington Award for Outstanding
2:29:01
Science Accomplishment by the Society of American Foresters.
2:29:06
His middle name is actually Forest.
2:29:08
Really?
2:29:09
Really.
2:29:11
I asked him about that.
2:29:14
He said that
2:29:18
he was called Gary for a long time.
2:29:21
There was a story about the doctor who delivered him was probably a
2:29:27
little tipsy, and he'd misspelled some stuff on the birth certificate.
2:29:33
And then, he only got called Jerry later in life, maybe high
2:29:39
school or college or something.
2:29:41
I recorded that and I think I've delivered notes about that.
2:29:46
Anyway, I think it's just a natural for him, this conspiracy of circumstances,
2:29:59
which is just an absolute incredible confluence.
2:30:03
And that he, things like the fact that he moved to the University of Washington,
2:30:07
so he could speak as a professor rather than being a Forest Service scientist.
2:30:14
And
2:30:18
that he loved to connect with the power structure and work the political
2:30:24
dimensions, and that the whole period, there's a paper that you should tune in on
2:30:31
that was in a special issue of Bioscience.
2:30:33
The title is "Scientists in Wonderland," which is a brief overview of science
2:30:42
input to policy from the Maynard Agency, Scientific Committee for the
2:30:46
Spotted Owl with Jack Ward Thomas, that led to the "Gang of Four" and
2:30:51
SAT and FEMAT; all these different ways to give input to policy.
2:30:57
And Jerry liked to intersect with the secretaries of Interior or Ag and
2:31:08
the members of Congress and so forth.
2:31:11
All these things just worked together.
2:31:15
The stage of this bioregion,
2:31:19
the issues it presented, and then, it all flowed out globally to Southeast
2:31:26
Australia and partnering with David Lindenmeier, who is a powerful
2:31:32
force there, and in North Europe and Scandinavia, and all this, it just
2:31:38
-- I mean, looking over his slew of his Forest Service publications and
2:31:43
the inventory work, he was a machine from the '50s all the way through.
2:31:50
Totally.
2:31:50
I mean, his production was incredible.
2:31:54
Totally.
2:31:54
And I mean,
2:31:57
they all seem like a lot of innovative ideas or at least project ideas going
2:32:05
forward, just here, there, everywhere, just synergizing toward something.
2:32:10
Is that a correct way to look at it?
2:32:13
Yes.
2:32:14
You should ask him
2:32:18
how far out the horizon is on what he's doing.
2:32:26
My impression is that it's not too far out there.
2:32:34
In fact, when he and I interacted, we've had times where we'
2:32:41
haven't seen things the same way.
2:32:44
I'm usually backed off and am sort of looking at a much bigger picture.
2:32:50
He's a bright light.
2:32:51
Yeah, and he's framing things for the next step or the next two steps.
2:32:57
Correct.
2:33:00
It's been very fruitful to have
2:33:05
our differences,
2:33:08
and
2:33:12
yet, share this affection and respect.
2:33:17
And that isn't just between Jerry and me, but, also with Jim and Stan.
2:33:22
I'm just thinking about it recently in the case of these memorials for Jim.
2:33:27
We had this group that got together down and dirty, digging our soil pits or
2:33:33
sampling the stuff in the stream with cold hands and all this, but then each person
2:33:39
went on and went out and did all kinds of things and communications with the
2:33:46
public and policy-makers, and working in different policy and management circles.
2:33:52
It was highly diverse, yet highly complementary, and a bunch of
2:34:00
us were disciples of Jerry.
2:34:02
So, Jerry isn't very much older than most of us, he's, I don't know, only like seven
2:34:09
years older than me, just a fairly small fraction of a generational difference.
2:34:14
But he has always seemed a whole generation older than me, because he's
2:34:20
been operating at such a high level from the first time I ever met him.
2:34:26
How do you think his obvious energy and just enthusiasm and innovation,
2:34:34
worked within the traditional Forest Service structure, especially back
2:34:40
in the '50s and '60s when he was becoming Jerry, this engine of
2:34:47
publications and research and ideas, and a team leader at a very young age?
2:34:53
How do you think he was reacted to by the traditional "good-old boy
2:34:58
network" of the Forest Service, even forwarding to your days?
2:35:02
Fred, I want you to also segue into what you saw in terms of you guys starting to
2:35:08
do ecosystem science within what was still a somewhat "old guard" Forest Service?
2:35:16
Right.
2:35:18
There's a very critical feature here.
2:35:23
And I was just thinking about it and I was talking with Bernard Bormann on Monday
2:35:28
as we drove up and back to St. Helens.
2:35:31
He's the son of Herb Bormann, of Likens and Bormann.
2:35:36
We were talking about what are the distinctive features of what
2:35:38
we have experience in our careers
2:35:43
that made possible what we've worked on.
2:35:50
And that includes this dimension that you raise of working within
2:35:56
sort of a paramilitary organization.
2:35:59
I think
2:36:02
we're 2,500 miles from Washington, D.C.
2:36:08
This historically, was a big timber-producing region and
2:36:11
this region had a lot of power.
2:36:15
So,
2:36:18
we're somewhat displaced from control.
2:36:22
We're unusual, the Forestry Sciences Lab [USFS] on the OSU campus is unusual
2:36:27
as a Forest Service research facility.
2:36:30
It's the second largest research facility in the nation, second only
2:36:34
to the Forest Products Lab [Madison, Wisconsin] . So, this is where a huge
2:36:39
supra-critical mass of ecological and all other kinds of talent is located, and
2:36:46
on a campus that is loaded with talent for dealing with natural resources,
2:36:51
nested in this region, and it's become a hotbed for this kind of thinking.
2:36:57
And the Andrews Forest has a great position,
2:37:03
the place is iconic.
2:37:05
The forest is humbling and iconic.
2:37:12
Our regional population took advanced courses in forest
2:37:18
ecology during the Forest Wars.
2:37:21
It drew tremendous attention to forest and rivers.
2:37:23
The Oregonian has stories about, the natural resources
2:37:30
and ecosystems, all the time.
2:37:34
Places like Mount St. Helens and Andrews are bigger than any of us.
2:37:39
They are flagships for the agency in terms of public profile.
2:37:48
And also
2:37:52
then, those of us who are Forest Service people have a lot of university
2:37:59
play, and
2:38:03
a place like our place operates at a very high scientific metabolism.
2:38:10
Many Forest Service scientists are at sleepy little locations not on a
2:38:15
university campus or not well-integrated with a university, and they're
2:38:20
subcritical mass in a bunch of respects.
2:38:22
Except for more limited subject matter like silviculture research
2:38:27
of the southern pine or something.
2:38:29
So, we just have been operating at a level which has given us a lot of latitude.
2:38:36
And I see us as performers on these stages.
2:38:40
So, Mount St. Helens is a stage, and we are performers, you understand.
2:38:46
And we have stories.
2:38:48
Mount St. Helens is an incredible stage.
2:38:50
A guy who was a former ecologist for the Forest Service, and then, for a
2:38:56
long time a lead staffer for a House Appropriations Committee, brought
2:39:04
a bunch of committee members up and arranged for the National Guard to take
2:39:11
us around for a day in three Black Hawk helicopters, taking off from Portland
2:39:20
Airport and flying into the crater.
2:39:22
I mean, talk about opportunities for performance and storytelling.
2:39:29
And so,
2:39:34
we ran hard, and sometimes maybe loose.
2:39:39
There was effort certainly to keep us under control.
2:39:43
And Jerry, when he was the leader of the group, would say, "Well, maybe, you
2:39:47
don't," you know, to administrators, "Maybe you don't want to ask too many
2:39:52
specific questions about the way we're building facilities out at the Andrews.
2:39:56
You might not like the answers." You know, when I took over, when
2:40:00
he departed, I felt like we needed to have a different attitude, and
2:40:07
make sure that they were seeing us as really integral to their programs, that
2:40:15
is, the dean of the College of Forestry [OSU] , and the station director [PNW]
2:40:22
and the Regional Forester [U.S. Forest Service Region] . But, anyway, there
2:40:26
was some playfulness in there, but and those were different times than today.
2:40:31
But wasn't there some competition or even resentment against, obviously
2:40:36
the ideas that became New Forestry and Jerry, and just the different ethic
2:40:43
that's involved with pure science versus science in the pursuit of economic gains?
2:40:48
I mean, there must have been tensions in there that you walked in on when
2:40:52
you were in the '70s, and Jerry being the strong personality he was, etc.,
2:40:56
etc. I mean, that was present, correct?
2:40:59
Well, I think some of those things were present.
2:41:03
And certainly, we had field trips where
2:41:11
there was open combat in a way.
2:41:15
Not within our group, but
2:41:17
-- From the outside, yeah.
2:41:20
And even from the College of Forestry, which was full of
2:41:24
utilitarian foresters back then?
2:41:26
Right, and these issues are still in effect.
2:41:29
Still there, but it's not the same, the balance has shifted, I know.
2:41:32
Yeah.
2:41:33
Just it's that the "Old Guard" has to die out.
2:41:37
But
2:41:41
yeah, that was around.
2:41:43
I never personally felt like somebody was trying to control
2:41:52
the message or control what we did.
2:41:56
We had this amazing spread from having substantial NSF dollars.
2:42:06
Which gave you power and credibility, in that sense?
2:42:09
Yeah.
2:42:11
And
2:42:11
-- You weren't drawing from line item Forest Service budget stuff in other words, also?
2:42:16
Not also.
2:42:17
I mean, so we had this whole RD&A, Research, Development and Application
2:42:22
spectrum, and the National Forest people
2:42:29
were really key players.
2:42:31
And that the selection of rangers and even supervisors on the Willamette,
2:42:39
included attention, interest and partnering with the research
2:42:44
community, which actually added substantially to their workload.
2:42:48
You know, for somebody like Lynn Burditt, who was ranger at Blue River
2:42:56
during the Forest Wars, and it is really critical for you to interview her,
2:43:02
she really had a massive extra workload to do this stuff.
2:43:10
And there were so many field trips with so many high-performing,
2:43:18
really important people, members of Congress, staffers, major
2:43:23
media, secretaries of cabinet-level departments and stuff like that.
2:43:34
I felt like we did our stuff.
2:43:41
And
2:43:43
I didn't feel like we had to really battle to get to do our stuff, other than to
2:43:50
just have the endurance to keep doing it.
2:43:54
To keep plugging away,
2:44:00
let us go back
2:44:05
in time a bit.
2:44:05
What about
2:44:07
the locals when you first went up in the '70s?
2:44:11
What do you remember about your interaction with them?
2:44:14
I mean, you were staying down closer to Blue River, you weren't
2:44:17
detached like the campus is now.
2:44:19
So, there must have been some interaction.
2:44:21
Who are these guys?
2:44:22
And you were shaggy guys, and obviously, there's some of that, the Cougar Room was
2:44:27
still at Blue River, and there was some interaction between the logging culture
2:44:32
and the academic, urban hippy-types, and I just wonder what that was like?
2:44:40
That's a little bit of a strange thing for our operation which came
2:44:46
into sharper focus for me when the Adaptive Management Areas were set up.
2:44:53
I picture that as there were 10 Adaptive Management Areas.
2:44:57
That was in the '80s, though, right?
2:44:58
Yeah, that was in the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:45:01
Oh, '90s then, okay.
2:45:03
That was '94 when that was signed as policy.
2:45:08
There are ten of them, four in Oregon, four in Washington, and two in California.
2:45:13
Two of the Adaptive Management Areas were archetypes for the whole set.
2:45:19
There was the Andrews, which had a strong research-management partnership, and there
2:45:23
was the Applegate down west of Ashland.
2:45:28
And that
2:45:32
is a large area, a mix of BLM and Forest Service lands, and a lot of
2:45:36
private land in the Applegate drainage.
2:45:39
Many people lived in that area, and that was the model for agency-public
2:45:47
interaction, and they had some very astute and active public folks.
2:45:57
We were supposed to have a public component, but we've had a hard time
2:46:00
doing that for the Andrews because there are a bunch of little, unincorporated
2:46:07
very-small communities along the McKenzie River, who are our nearest neighbors.
2:46:16
Then you hit Eugene and Springfield, which is a big, rather detached
2:46:21
place about 50 miles away.
2:46:22
But back in the '70s, what do you remember, and even the early
2:46:25
'80s, what do you remember about interactions with the people?
2:46:28
I mean, you guys were there, they knew you were there.
2:46:32
I mean, you knew people, right?
2:46:33
You met people?
2:46:33
Yeah, I can go there.
2:46:34
Yeah, I never was party to many interactions.
2:46:38
I mean, I'd go to the grocery store and I'd go to a gas station,
2:46:41
and eat in the Blue River Cafe.
2:46:43
And sometimes, we'd interact with Fred Banes,
2:46:50
who was a logger who had a place up Blue River just from the mouth.
2:46:55
You just go out of town maybe a quarter mile, up towards the dam.
2:46:59
And he'd logged some land out there that then we did studies on, and it
2:47:05
was traded over to the Forest Service.
2:47:08
And
2:47:11
then also, early on, I remember Jerry would bring a logger
2:47:15
from, who was a forester for
2:47:20
Rosboro Timber that owned a few tens of thousands of acres, I believe, up there in
2:47:28
Quartz Creek, just on the south side of the McKenzie.
2:47:34
Those big clear-cuts up there are Rosboro.
2:47:37
Anyway, I felt like we had good relationships with those people.
2:47:42
In the early days?
2:47:43
Yeah.
2:47:43
Before the Forest Wars?
2:47:45
Yeah.
2:47:45
And that changed things, though, didn't it?
2:47:48
Well, there
2:47:49
-- With some people, anyway.
2:47:50
Yeah.
2:47:51
And in the early days of the Adaptive Management stuff, '95-'96, we had public
2:47:57
meetings, including in the high school.
2:48:01
But somehow,
2:48:05
we just couldn't, we never did really connect on a sustained
2:48:07
basis with local people.
2:48:10
We did have
2:48:22
many field trips, public field trips, especially in the '90
2:48:25
to '95 or '96 to '97 period.
2:48:26
We had a public meeting in the New Perspectives [U.S. Forest
2:48:30
Service program] era right
2:48:33
in Eugene right next to the railroad track.
2:48:36
And
2:48:41
we had offered some public field trips.
2:48:44
Then we'd have
2:48:49
continuing public, critical public conversations about the future
2:48:54
of the forests and forestry.
2:48:57
And we'd have a Forest Service scientist, a Forest Service land
2:49:01
manager, generally the ranger and the research liaison, and a university
2:49:06
person, together showing our work to the public and having conversations.
2:49:13
Some of that was actually studied by social scientists both in
2:49:18
the earliest '90s, and then in the latter part of the 2000's.
2:49:27
So, let's see, I wonder if we should
2:49:33
-- How would you describe the facilities research equipment and scientific
2:49:38
capabilities of the H.J. when you arrived?
2:49:43
And how did that improve during your tenure, and maybe you'd want to
2:49:48
start and address this in sections for somebody with your longevity.
2:49:51
And just kind of tell me what it was like in the '70s?
2:49:55
What were
2:49:57
the technological capabilities?
2:49:59
What was the infrastructure scientifically and otherwise to
2:50:01
support even connection to university
2:50:07
[coughs], excuse me - database management?
2:50:13
What were your capabilities?
2:50:15
Now, obviously, you worked within the constraints of those days, but today,
2:50:18
how would you look back on that?
2:50:22
Yes.
2:50:24
My own work
2:50:29
did not rely on
2:50:33
fancy instrumentation or data management because I was out and just trying
2:50:39
to cruise the landscape and make observations and notes, and notes
2:50:47
in notebooks and pinpricks on air photos, and make maps.
2:50:55
So, like the facilities at
2:51:03
the site, and in the supporting facilities nearby, like with the trailers and
2:51:06
the lab, was really quite rudimentary.
2:51:12
And it was a big step forward in around 1980 when we began to
2:51:16
develop the headquarters site.
2:51:19
So, the campus, where is it now, you started to have, it
2:51:22
was still trailers, but at least it was a real facilities site?
2:51:29
Yeah, it was right there.
2:51:30
You could get under cover.
2:51:33
It could be dry.
2:51:38
And driving time to field sites was really reduced, which was good.
2:51:49
And so, there was always a push
2:51:56
to upgrade facilities, upgrade connectivity, and we continue
2:52:00
to be pushing that all the time.
2:52:02
It's just sort of a constant thing, connectivity from field instruments,
2:52:07
meteorological stations or gauging stations, can we get real-time high-speed
2:52:12
data delivery from the field to the headquarters site and then down to town.
2:52:19
But that took quite a long time to actually have phone hookups, right?
2:52:25
Yeah, and then to get a T1 line, and tie in.
2:52:30
I mean, we had to deal with the National Forest system, and the National
2:52:34
Forest-university interfaces can be troubling, you know, challenging.
2:52:41
Now, what was at that campus, where the campus is now, what was there
2:52:46
before there was anything, was it an open field or was it cleared?
2:52:51
The Andrews Headquarters Site was, had been an old-growth forest, that
2:52:59
then was clear-cut, and a plantation was established there back around
2:53:04
'60, 1960, or something like that.
2:53:07
And then
2:53:10
about twenty years later
