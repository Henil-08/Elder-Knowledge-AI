00:01
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Courtesy Faculty, Oregon
00:07
State University College of Forestry.
00:11
I am here in Corvallis, Oregon, at the home of Dr. Fred Swanson,
00:16
Senior Scientist with the Forest Service, long-term scientist with
00:21
the Andrews Experimental Forest.
00:22
This is interview
00:25
2 in our ongoing interview between myself and Dr. Swanson.
00:31
We are going to pick up here.
00:33
It's November 15, 2013.
00:37
We're going to complete the interview, or come close to it, the
00:39
interview that we began on November 1 here in the same location at
00:43
Fred's home in south Corvallis.
00:46
Anyway, we're back on, Fred.
00:48
So, would you prefer to go into that stuff or do you want to go back to
00:53
where we ended the last interview.
00:54
The last interview, by the way, ended in the middle of Fred describing the
00:59
reason for the campus of the H.J. Andrews Forest being located where it is today.
01:07
Well, let me just put this one idea down that I've been thinking about because of
01:12
other writing and discussion assignments.
01:17
And then we can come back to the Andrews Forest campus location.
01:22
Anyway, Fred's going to go on to some points that he was speaking about
01:25
before we turned on the recorder here.
01:28
I thought he was practicing, he thought he was being recorded.
01:30
So, we're going to reiterate that again and perhaps he will be really
01:34
crystal-clear now that it's round two.
01:38
Okay.
01:41
These thoughts are in the context of the importance of place, especially
01:45
the Andrews Forest, and then the blast zone at Mount St. Helens.
01:50
And I view those two places and the activities that have occurred there
02:00
as "Zen Masters," throwing down interesting riddles, teaching us
02:07
new lessons by presenting certain phenomena in extreme cases.
02:14
And awakening us to "aha" moments, not as the product of rigorous analysis
02:24
of long data streams, but really just intuitive leaps of recognition.
02:33
On Mount St. Helens, three cases of this sort of learning, come to mind.
02:41
The first is the biological legacy story.
02:45
So, the eruption leveled the forest and left it gray over 125
02:53
square miles of the blast zone.
02:58
We were struck by the plants emerging and animals emerging from various
03:06
nooks and crannies, various refugia,
03:10
in the first few months after the eruption, and thereafter.
03:16
Jerry Franklin ran with this notion of the importance of these legacies
03:22
from the pre-eruption ecosystem, and used that to develop his thinking over
03:29
the decade after the eruption to about the 1990 period when he was promoting
03:38
"New Forestry," as an alternative to clear-cutting, which involved leaving
03:44
live trees and deadwood on the land, and
03:54
putting the focus on what you leave, rather than on what you take from a site.
03:59
Those ideas are continuing to be chewed over and argued today 33 years later.
04:07
Now, the term is "ecological forestry."
04:11
By the way, the term "Zen Master," is that something you maybe borrowed
04:15
from, or at least weaned from your influence and exposure with Gary Snyder?
04:21
Well, he certainly is a
04:26
life-long student of Zen, and so that it is a West Coast-type view.
04:33
But also, the work on early seral vegetation which Mount
04:37
St. Helens created and left as a protracted legacy of the eruption.
04:43
Still, there are areas in front of the volcano, the "pumice plain,"
04:48
that is still a very slow succession.
04:52
And there is discussion now about the important of early seral in the green
04:56
forests more generally, because aspects of forest management on both private and
05:03
public lands for different reasons, the early seral habitats and their complex
05:09
food webs may be in decline, in extent.
05:15
At the Andrews, ancient forests, now about 500 years in age, have really brought
05:24
into sharp focus the nature of old growth.
05:28
Also the importance of big dead wood on land, the importance of big
05:33
wood in streams, and importance of viewing roads and streams and riparian
05:39
zones as networks laced through the patchworks of the forest landscape.
05:45
The network thinking is an important contribution to landscape ecology, and the
05:52
potential value in using and understanding the historic disturbance regime, the
05:57
historic range of variability concepts in planning future forest management.
06:02
All of these topics have been in a sense pushed on us by these landscapes.
06:12
And in that way, the landscapes have been great teachers.
06:17
I think it's important that we begin to think about this and incorporate these
06:24
kinds of ideas in the way we educate our future scientists, encouraging them
06:30
to be open to "aha moments," and not so absorbed in their instrumentation
06:38
and their data sets and so forth so that they fail to give themselves
06:43
opportunity to let the land speak to them.
06:49
Also, these points are entirely consistent with the spirit of LTER, both Long-Term
06:57
Ecological Research and Reflections [Arts and Humanities programs at HJA]
06:59
in terms of the surprising outcomes of sustained, place-based inquiry.
07:08
So, now it's probably time to move on to the topic that we let go at
07:12
the end of the first interview.
07:14
Okay.
07:15
[Break in audio]
07:16
Now, a little takeoff and what you just said, Fred.
07:19
You are now, I guess you'd say you are a geomorphologist,
07:26
an ecological scientist.
07:29
But going specifically to what you just said about disturbances and disturbance
07:33
ecology, how has your understanding of that discipline or sub-discipline,
07:39
theoretical and applied, evolved from when you were a student, an early
07:42
working professional to now, and maybe you can insert the St. Helens
07:46
thing in the middle of that gradient?
07:50
As a physical process person and earth scientist in an ecosystem group, I always
07:55
felt like my job was to study death, and a few ecosystems involving life and death.
08:03
And so, it's a little imbalanced, because most of the practitioners
08:06
of ecological sciences are life scientists, so I had to work hard to
08:12
hold up the death end of the equation.
08:15
But anyway, as a physical process person, I also think it's important
08:21
in order to understand ecosystem dynamics, it's important to view
08:28
disturbance agents in their own right, and not only through the lens
08:33
of how they affect the organisms, the living part of the ecosystem.
08:44
Let's see, before Mount St. Helens, in the '70s, when I was a post-doc
08:49
and then, early career Forest Service scientist, I was studying landslides
08:54
and I began to study fire history.
08:59
I was interested in wind-throw and floods causing river channel changes.
09:05
So, I was quite keen on these physical disturbances, examining them one-by-one
09:11
and trying to interpret their history based on direct observations, the written
09:16
records, and then also interpretation of land forms and attempts to date
09:21
them using tree ring techniques, for example, and also, aerial photographs.
09:28
Mount St. Helens was particularly interesting and striking because
09:31
there were a variety of disturbance processes, volcanic and the associated
09:38
hydrological processes, that banged up a big piece of real estate in
09:46
the southern Cascades of Washington.
09:49
There was a giant landslide.
09:53
There was a lateral blast.
09:55
There was a vertical tephra plume that then blew off to the east,
10:03
northeast, and around the globe, and fell out, rained out on the forest.
10:08
There were mud flows.
10:09
There were domes that grew within the crater, and then blew up and
10:14
dumped gravel off to the northeast.
10:18
And there were pyroclastic flows.
10:24
It's just a hell of a lot of action, and each of those different
10:29
volcanic and associated hydrological processes, had a different suite of
10:35
mechanisms that affected vegetation.
10:39
It might be erosion or deposition.
10:44
There was heat-thermal stress from not very hot at all to extreme heat, and
10:56
then there were impact forces vigorous enough to rip huge trees out of the
11:01
ground and blow them long distances.
11:06
And there was abrasion.
11:08
In some cases, trees were deeply sand-blasted, for example,
11:15
by some of these processes.
11:16
So, it was very interesting to study the different processes and their
11:23
effects on vegetation and then, the response of the ecological systems to
11:29
those different types of disturbances.
11:30
So, that greatly enriched our disturbance ecology perspectives.
11:38
Now, going to my question list, kind of an addendum list to the
11:42
regular list about St. Helens.
11:46
What assumptions, theoretical and otherwise, did you and others on your U.S.
11:55
Forest Service team carry into the blast zone, especially the ones that had to
12:00
be modified or overturned because of the evidence you saw, almost immediately,
12:05
if I recall reading the literature?
12:10
Well,
12:13
most of the people in our group had not done much with
12:16
contemporary eruption outcomes.
12:21
Who had?
12:22
Right?
12:24
Yeah, and of those sorts.
12:25
I
12:28
think everybody had hiked in the Cascades, and many people had been to Hawaii and
12:31
seen the product of recent lava flows.
12:35
And the legacies of lava flows are quite conspicuous, even lava flows
12:39
some thousands of years in the past,
12:46
which are very slow to revegetate.
12:48
So, on the one hand, our ecosystem group had had about a decade to
12:54
learn how to work together and understand how forest and streams and
13:00
geomorphic processes and land forms operate in green Cascadian forests.
13:08
But, I think we were all totally shocked and stunned and awestruck
13:15
when we first went in there.
13:17
Do you remember what went through your mind the first time you went in a
13:24
helicopter, right into the middle of it.
13:27
And obviously, you were flying over, and do you remember what was said
13:32
in the helicopter when you got off?
13:34
Do you remember what you were thinking?
13:36
I mean, just tell me about that moment, or those moments, those first few minutes.
13:44
Well, it was just, it was extremely exciting.
13:51
There were overcast skies.
13:54
There were little bits of rain.
13:58
We heard that there was a volcanic tremor and there was concern
14:01
about further eruptive activity.
14:03
This was on day ten after the eruption.
14:07
We had four people in the helicopter.
14:09
Barry Voight, who was a professor at Penn State and had been an
14:14
instructor in a geology field course I'd taken as an undergraduate.
14:19
Harry Glicken, who had been a field assistant to David Johnston, and had been
14:26
relieved of duties at their station on what's now called Johnston's Ridge in
14:34
honor of David Johnston, who was blown away by the eruption the next morning.
14:40
And Harry was still suffering survivor's guilt.
14:45
He'd gone out to do his laundry.
14:48
So, he was there the day before?
14:50
Yes, he left the evening of May 17.
14:53
David was not supposed to be there.
14:55
He was just the replacement guy?
14:57
David was the U.S.G.S. geologist, the senior guy, and Harry had just
15:02
completed his undergraduate degree.
15:04
So, he departed to do his laundry, but also to meet with his prospective
15:08
major advisor to go to grad school.
15:11
I still remember reading the transcripts of Johnston's last words on his radio.
15:18
Didn't he say something like, "This is it, this is it!"
15:21
"Vancouver, Vancouver, this is it!"
15:23
Right.
15:23
Vancouver, Washington, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, was the interagency
15:29
headquarters for communications about the Mount St. Helens situation.
15:36
And how long would he have had to react, considering the speed of
15:40
the pyroclastic flow heading for him at what, if he was what, three,
15:43
five miles, away from the crater?
15:45
Yeah, five or six miles, the first ridge in front of the volcano.
15:51
So, he
15:53
-- No chance?
15:53
He just had a minute or two.
15:55
And as far as I know, his truck, his camp, his body, have never been found.
16:01
Some day, maybe.
16:01
I expect it was blown over the ridge and into the next valley, the south
16:09
Coldwater Valley, which has quite a bit of
16:13
deposits in the bottom.
16:15
Yeah.
16:16
So, he's probably buried there.
16:18
Anyway, it was, you know, mind-boggling.
16:23
And we looked at some mind-boggling things.
16:27
There were some geysers, muddy geysers at the south shore of
16:32
Spirit Lake, where I think the giant landslide deposit had been left.
16:38
It had triggered a 300-foot high water wave to the north when
16:45
it splashed into Spirit Lake.
16:47
That water wave flowed to the north, up the valleys that drained towards
16:51
the volcano and into Spirit Lake.
16:55
And then it sloshed back down up onto the lower part of the landslide
16:59
deposit filling depressions there.
17:03
All that would have occurred probably in the first couple of major processes in the
17:09
first ten minutes or so of the eruption.
17:10
What photographic or video evidence, if any, is there of any of these processes,
17:15
and live, other than obviously the column [eruption] that we saw, you know, in
17:20
the news later on, maybe an hour later.
17:22
Was there anything that survived, or any of the people that were on the periphery
17:26
of the red zone, did they, I mean, other than the ones that lived, obviously?
17:31
Gary Rosenquist.
17:32
There were several photo sequences.
17:34
One of the most famous and most deeply analyzed from the science
17:38
point-of-view, are those taken by Gary Rosenquist, well out, maybe ten
17:45
or so miles northeast of the volcano.
17:50
And so, he had a slightly, you know, the blast was to
17:55
the north, the big landslides.
17:57
And he was viewing it sort of from the east, so you could see the progression of
18:02
the blast clouds and the landslide blocks.
18:06
And then Barry Voight, the guy who was leading our group on that May 28 trip,
18:11
did analyze them in such a way that he could calculate to the tenth of a second
18:17
the time interval between successive images, and then compute the velocity
18:24
of different parts of the blast cloud and of the landslide blocks, as they
18:32
began to move over the first seconds.
18:36
Now,
18:38
was Jerry Franklin also in that helicopter?
18:40
No.
18:41
Oh, so it was just you, Glicken and Voight?
18:46
And Voight.
18:46
In the helicopter?
18:47
And a fourth guy named Ray Wells.
18:49
Okay.
18:49
And we'd been grad students together at the U of O, and then, he was starting
18:53
to work for U.S. Geological Survey.
18:58
And Barry Voight is the brother of Jon Voight, the actor.
19:03
Really?
19:07
Yeah.
19:07
Anyway, we went, and were trying to, we were looking at those muddy geysers.
19:13
I think then the pyroclastic flows came down on the afternoon of May 18,
19:17
flowed into these ponds, and then that's what triggered these steam eruptions.
19:22
So that was occurring along the south shore, southwest shore of Spirit Lake.
19:27
Was there fear?
19:27
Did you guys have active fear, like, whoa, could this go again, or were
19:32
you pretty sure that the major blast had occurred, or you didn't know?
19:39
We didn't know.
19:39
But we were just there, you know.
19:44
To me, it was like being present at the birth of kids.
19:49
The world?
19:49
Oh, yeah, or of kids.
19:50
Yeah, it's a very primal feeling.
19:54
And we were looking at things like where the big landslide had gone.
19:59
Some pieces of the big landslide had surfed up the west arm of Spirit
20:02
Lake, and some had ridden over the thousand-foot high ridge that came
20:07
to be called Johnston's Ridge.
20:10
And so, we were looking at the deposits up there and Barry was
20:13
interested in the question of, did the landslide or the blast get here first?
20:21
And so, we were looking at, I remember looking at some of the trees that were
20:26
included within the landslide deposit, and could see that the alectoroid
20:32
lichens on the boles were still a light green as they are in a healthy green
20:41
forest, so it looked like they had not been scorched before the landslide
20:45
moved the trees into that position.
20:48
And I remember talking with Barry and Harry about that.
20:56
What was your methodology when you first went in there?
20:59
What'd you do, you just did measurements of ash, temperatures, took photographs?
21:06
I mean, what tools and measurements, what method did you do when you went in there?
21:10
What was it?
21:13
I had two roles, I felt.
21:15
One was the science I tried to do, was to measure erosion rates in
21:23
the new deposits in the blast zone.
21:27
In places that had blown-down timber, in places that didn't have
21:31
blown-down timber because they were pre-eruption clear-cuts, and then
21:37
in some areas where the blown-down timber was going to be salvage-logged.
21:42
So, both the plant people and some of us erosion people tried to put
21:46
in these plots, adjacent paired-up plots with pre-eruption clear-cut,
21:54
blown-down timber not removed, and blown-down timber removed.
21:59
So, I put erosion pins, which were quarter-inch
22:05
rebar, you know, maybe 18 inches long, and drove these pins in every so many
22:12
meters across the slope at successive distances down-slope away from the
22:20
drainage divided, the ridgeline, and then, measured the height of the pin.
22:25
Each one had a numbered tag on it
22:29
at successive times over several years.
22:33
Then I measured the width and depth of small gullies cut into
22:37
the new deposits wherever they occurred between successive pins.
22:41
So, then we could measure the net erosion or deposition based on
22:47
change in the height of the pins, you know, because if there's erosion,
22:53
then more of the pin was exposed.
22:55
If there was deposition, then less of it was exposed.
22:59
And also, the gullies would get larger over time.
23:04
And when was the first significant rainfall after the first big eruption?
23:08
There were very light rains in the weeks after the eruption.
23:12
And they were big enough to cut little rills, you know, channels
23:17
only a couple millimeters wide.
23:19
I mean, a couple centimeters wide and a centimeter or so deep.
23:23
But then, in the first fall rains, then deeper gullies were cut.
23:28
And so, it was very fun and interesting work, and there was a lot of variation
23:34
depending on slope steepness and, also, the texture of the deposits.
23:40
So, if you had a lot of -- we tended to have a couple centimeters of very
23:44
fine sandy and silty material -- and then over gravel, gravel was harder
23:51
to erode, in the places I worked.
23:53
But then some companions from the University of Washington were working
23:58
more north, and I was working more to the northeast, and they had less
24:04
gravel and they had more erosion.
24:09
But an interesting thing was that in some places, the new channels would cut down
24:14
through the new deposits, which may be 30 to 50 centimeters thick in places,
24:23
down to the old forest floor, and then, stopped cutting for several reasons.
24:27
Then some places, we saw most of the revegetation coming up from the
24:32
floors of the gullies, both plants liberated by, were able to sprout
24:39
from root stocks, for example,
24:45
and they were liberated from burial by this erosion.
24:48
But also, seeds were blown across the surface and would get trapped in
24:51
these gullies which weren't carrying significant amounts of water after
24:59
the first few rains, because the fine deposits on the surface were removed
25:08
and then the gravel was exposed, so the water wasn't running off very
25:14
much anymore, it was infiltrating.
25:17
And therefore, the gullies were not being actively excavated.
25:22
So, actually, erosion
25:26
benefited revegetation, which is counterintuitive.
25:31
And so, that was an interesting and surprising discovery.
25:34
My other function was to help work at the interface of the geology community.
25:40
And I had colleagues in U.S.G.S. from having worked for U.S.G.S. a
25:46
year and two summers, and having other contacts with U.S.G.S. people.
25:51
So, I could be an interface between the geologists and the ecologists.
25:56
And a key lesson from St. Helens was you couldn't tell the best geology
26:01
story that was possible unless you really paid attention to the ecology.
26:08
And you couldn't tell the best ecology story unless you really had your
26:12
geologic setting perspective down.
26:18
So, for me, that was an incredible opportunity to work at the geo-eco
26:29
interface, the geology-ecology interface, which my work had
26:33
already come to focus on.
26:36
You know, when I was working at the Andrews in conjunction with the U.S.
26:40
Geological Survey, buddy Dick Janda, we both had forest geomorphology projects.
26:50
And I did a class quite a few times on forest geomorphology,
26:55
which really dealt with
26:59
what are the geomorphology phenomenon in terms of land forms and physical processes
27:06
that are important and distinctive to forest, forested landscapes, and the kinds
27:13
of disturbances that occur in forests.
27:15
So, the volcano dimension was a very interesting and cool component to add to
27:25
this forest geomorphology perspective.
27:28
Now, here, even in my retirement, I continue to work on that in new
27:33
settings such as at Chaiten Volcano and Cordon Caulle Puyehue Volcano in
27:43
southern Chile at a latitude comparable to the latitude that we work at here.
27:50
Theirs is southern, and ours is northern hemisphere.
27:55
But it's a great opportunity to take our hypotheses, lessons, and
28:03
stories from St. Helens, and explore them in other situations where
28:11
some of the geologic processes are similar, but the forests have some
28:16
interesting and important differences.
28:21
How did the second major eruption affect what you were doing
28:24
in the first set of plots and measurements that you were doing?
28:28
The eruption happened like three or four weeks later, I believe, right?
28:33
So, the
28:33
-- It wasn't as catastrophic, but it was still significant.
28:37
Right.
28:37
The main eruption at St. Helens was May 18,
28:45
and then,
28:48
St. Helens grew small domes, and then blew them up multiple times, mainly
28:57
over the course of the summer, which was sort of a dangerous situation.
29:06
It also emitted more pyroclastic flows, and did emit some mud flows.
29:14
Then when the domes blew up, that's when some of the pyroclastic flows
29:19
occurred, but also it launched the dome rock up into the atmosphere and
29:26
blew off to the northeast over some of the areas we were working in.
29:32
What was the one that hit Portland with the ash?
29:34
It was in June, correct?
29:37
Yeah, I think June 12-13.
29:38
There was one in July.
29:44
Where it landed was a function of wind currents and winds, which
29:50
could be blowing in different directions at different altitudes.
29:53
So, you end up with some pretty complex ash clouds.
30:02
How did this dramatic and immediate disturbance compare and contrast
30:06
with other forms of disturbances that occur more frequently such as
30:11
floods, wind storms, fires, etc.?
30:14
And after this became part of your scientific life, how did it affect
30:22
you when you go back to the Andrews or other, more "normal" landscapes
30:28
and looking at disturbances, whether it be slower earth flows,
30:34
landslides, fires, wind storms, etc.?
30:37
It immediately affected you, I would think, but also in a longer-term way?
30:43
Right.
30:50
It just reinforced in my mind just the richness of the whole
30:54
disturbance ecology field.
30:57
You know, Mount St. Helens blew up in '80 and
31:06
I'd been working on disturbances in the Andrews, and
31:14
the main book on disturbance ecology in the U.S. didn't
31:17
come out until the mid-'80s.
31:19
So, disturbance ecology is a field which is beginning to take shape.
31:27
As I mentioned, the multiple types of physical processes involved in that
31:32
eruption really reinforced in my mind the importance of taking a very broad view.
31:40
I mean, people tend to be fire people, or tend to be windthrow
31:45
people, or bark beetle people.
31:49
And here this, the St. Helens experience, really pushed us to think
31:55
very broadly about many types of disturbances and the great variety
32:00
of impacts they have on the system.
32:03
And so, some of the general notions are one, if a disturbance is pretty intense
32:12
and severe, it is likely to trigger a succession of physical processes as
32:19
well as succession of biotic phenomena.
32:24
Then this parallels of physical changes in the landscape
32:31
and biological changes in the landscape, and their interactions, is an important
32:36
way to be thinking about the system, and give good attention to the physical part.
32:41
In some cases of severe disturbance, the system has to settle down
32:45
physically before the biology can really kick in in spades.
32:50
Like at St. Helens, the SCS,
32:55
Soil Conservation Service, wanted to spend $12 million to spread grass
32:59
seed over the blast zone for erosion control to protect Kelso-Longview
33:05
downstream [Cowlitz/Toutle Rivers]
33:07
. On the Cowlitz, right?
33:08
Yeah.
33:14
But,
33:16
you know, ecologists objected on several grounds, including they were going
33:21
to use a non-native grass species.
33:27
And there was a big push then to establish the National Volcanic Monument,
33:34
which ultimately was established at approximately 110,000 acres.
33:39
And interesting language within that legislation was to "allow natural
33:44
processes to proceed substantially unimpeded." Wow, that's amazing
33:51
language to have in an act of Congress.
33:54
I
33:56
think those people don't think that way very often.
34:00
Well, this Congress would probably not pass such a law.
34:05
[Laughs]
34:07
Well, I think that the executive branch at that time wasn't disposed
34:15
in that direction [Jimmy Carter's last term/Ronald Reagan's first term]
34:17
. True.
34:17
But anyway, in the end, I think they spent $2 million and did spread a bunch
34:26
of grass seed, but a lot of it washed off the slopes in the first rains.
34:31
Right.
34:31
That's a case of the physical system not being ready yet.
34:35
So,
34:38
that was one idea that's a parallel interaction between the physical system
34:43
succession and the ecological succession.
34:46
Another was the landscape being so modified, that there was a whole host
34:52
of secondary disturbance processes that operated, really operated
34:58
within the broad imprint of the primary disturbances to do a lot of
35:03
fine detail of editing within that.
35:07
And the nature of those secondary processes
35:12
from one disturbance zone to another.
35:14
Like big landslides and mud flows
35:19
and continuing
35:19
--? Shallow landslides from very steep slopes where the forest had been toppled
35:23
and roots were ripped out of the soil.
35:25
And the weight of the mud and when rain came down, it just [noise], yeah.
35:29
Yeah.
35:32
But we should get back to the Andrews.
35:33
No, we are.
35:36
This [St.
35:36
Helens] is all part of it, though.
35:38
When you returned to the Andrews, and obviously, your intense period of
35:42
study in St. Helens was about what, about five years, before it lessened?
35:48
I mean, obviously, you're still involved, but what was the
35:51
intense period of study for you?
35:53
Yeah, the first four or five years, and that included several of us who
35:57
were working on the management plan for the National Volcanic Monument.
36:03
So, we'd go up and stay in Vancouver, Washington, at the headquarters at Gifford
36:10
Pinchot National Forest, and work on that plan, the zoning and other issues related
36:19
to protecting the ecological resources and learning opportunities consistent
36:26
with the National Volcanic Monument Act.
36:29
So, there were many different kinds of duties, including field tripping
36:36
and stuff like that.
36:39
My engagement decreased, and then I worked hard on the Year 25
36:49
book,
36:52
and then also on the 2000, 2005 and
36:58
2010 "Science Pulses" up there.
37:01
And in 2000, I started getting involved with taking, trying to take
37:06
poets and other humanists out there.
37:10
That's when you got to know Snyder up there.
37:12
Correct?
37:13
We went out there in 2000.
37:20
Now, you were still doing your regular stuff down south [HJA] , as 1980 was
37:28
also year number one of the LTER.
37:31
You're going back-and-forth.
37:33
What do you remember about the interface, of not only the landscapes that what you
37:38
saw there, here, back-and-forth, the idea of the LTER transitioning from what the
37:46
IBP was, and even they called them the EERs at first, before it was an LTER?
37:50
What do you remember about that whole interface, both logistically and
37:57
conceptually, just as you were moving into year one of the LTER or Phase 1 of LTER 1?
38:01
In
38:08
that late '70s, 1980 period,
38:17
my memory is a little fuzzy, I think because so much was going on.
38:24
My wife and I at the time, we just had had our son born in
38:35
'78 and were busy home-making, and I remember working on the
38:47
proposal for LTER at that time.
38:53
Dick Waring, who had teamed with Jerry Franklin to lead us during the IBP era,
39:01
Dick was still engaged, and I remember him pushing us hard, that this was
39:07
all to be about long-term experiments.
39:11
I remember we were working on that proposal and we'd written
39:15
in some long-term experiments, several of which did not come to
39:19
fruition for one reason or another.
39:23
Andrews long-term experiments, correct?
39:25
Right, LTER long-term experiments.
39:30
And of course, Mount St. Helens was just quite overwhelming.
39:37
There was science to be done, but first of all, you just had to begin to rocket.
39:42
I remember, I would try to get people to come help me do the erosion studies.
39:50
And that was hard, dirty labor on steep slopes.
39:57
Hot and exposed.
40:00
No shade?
40:03
But, most of the places we were going, we got to go in a helicopter.
40:10
So, it's a trip to go on a helicopter, and it's especially a "trip" to fly
40:17
over an amazing landscape like that.
40:20
So, I always felt like when we'd go in there, we had to give people,
40:27
especially volunteer labor, a little bit of time to get through some of
40:33
the "ooh-ah's," as we called it.
40:35
You had to go in there and say, "Ooh, ah, holy shit, look at this," before
40:42
you could start rubbing your nose in the tephra, and get down to work.
40:49
Also, there was a lot of communicating to be done.
40:57
We ran field pulses in the summer of '80 and '81.
41:02
Jerry had been running pulses.
41:04
He'd pulse.
41:05
A pulse was when he'd take his people, students, technicians,
41:10
colleagues, out to a compelling landscape, the Hoh River in westside
41:19
Olympic Peninsula, down to the giant
41:24
Sequoias National Park area, other places, and have a ten-day
41:30
to two-week immersion experience.
41:32
Put in veg plots and some people would wander around and find other stories.
41:42
We used that at Mount St. Helens because there was disgruntlement
41:49
within the science community about the difficulty of gaining access.
41:53
You needed special Forest Service permits.
41:55
You needed to have radios that worked on Forest Service frequencies.
41:59
How
42:02
difficult was it to get the permission that first time?
42:05
Because of danger, obviously.
42:07
There were people concerned about that.
42:09
Well, my impression is that the Forest Service was much more difficult,
42:15
and through the Forest Service, it was more difficult to gain
42:18
access than it was for the U.S.G.S. U.S.G.S. was used to volcanoes.
42:24
The Forest Service was used to big forest fires, but not used to volcanoes.
42:29
And the National Forest system was safety-focused and conservative,
42:37
and unfamiliar with volcanoes.
42:39
So, the first trip I went in on was with U.S.G.S. people.
42:48
And so, sometimes we had to fly under the bureaucratic radar to go in.
42:55
You snuck in, sort of?
42:57
Sort of, right, yes.
42:59
And it was so important to get there at the get-go, because some phenomena
43:07
were very transient, and there were so many amazing things happening in so
43:14
many different ways and so many places.
43:18
Big blocks of glacier ice in the landslide deposits were melting out
43:23
and forming these big depressions, or the pyroclastic flows had been cut by
43:31
gullies, and then there were fumaroles in the walls of the pyroclastic flows.
43:37
So, one gulley, we called "Sauna Gulley," because you'd walk through it
43:41
and you felt like you were in a sauna.
43:43
Then there'd be little halos of mosses and sprouting fireweed seeds
43:50
around these fumaroles because it was in a desiccated landscape, except
43:56
the fumaroles from the gulley walls
44:01
were emitting steam and then the steam, the vapors would cool enough that there
44:06
would be condensation in the surrounding areas, so there'd be these little
44:09
biological hot spots, these little halos.
44:13
So anyway, there were just all these amazing things and we
44:15
just wanted to get out there and look at them and figure it out.
44:18
So, a lot of people were putting in plots like crazy, but it was also very
44:23
important to just get out there and wander around and see what was going on.
44:28
Was the landscape dangerous?
44:32
How did you avoid, just all the instability factors and it's all
44:38
-- Well, there were certainly dangers to be aware of.
44:41
One of the fun days, most fun days I had, I forget what year it was.
44:47
It might have been in '83 or '84.
44:49
To get dropped off at the mouth of the crater and to spend the
44:55
day circumambulating the dome.
44:58
Which was hot?
45:00
There had been a dome-growth eruption the previous week or two.
45:04
And so, there were some house-sized boulders in there.
45:07
And you walked towards them, I mean, you could feel the heat radiating from
45:11
these huge boulders that had rolled off the dome onto the crater floor between
45:18
the crater wall where boulders were bouncing down and the steaming dome.
45:25
Today, that's all occupied by this giant glacier that has filled this sort of
45:30
instantly-formed cirque-basin of the north-facing gaping caldera crater.
45:39
And it's, of all the glaciers in the world, it's unique in having formed within
45:49
the last thirty years, and practically all the other ones are receding.
45:52
Does it have a name already?
45:54
Yes, it does.
45:56
And there was a competition for the name.
45:59
I remember Gary Snyder put forward an Indian name.
46:07
But in the end, I think it was just something very, I think
46:11
U.S.G.S., and geographic place names board must have come up with it.
46:15
It was something like Crater Glacier, I think, you know, a very prosaic name.
46:22
Very descriptive, yes.
46:23
So, anyway, it was dangerous and
46:30
you had to
46:33
be careful.
46:34
But, it's our business to understand those instabilities,
46:39
so hopefully we won't get killed.
46:44
But people get killed, you know, like David Johnston had dodged a
46:49
bullet in an Alaskan volcano when he was told to abandon his camp.
46:57
Redoubt or Katmai, or one of those areas?
47:00
I think it was Redoubt.
47:01
Yeah.
47:02
But the weather closed in and the helicopter couldn't get him, so he had
47:05
to stay there longer than they thought it was safe, based on, I presume, listening
47:10
to harmonic tremor and seismic signals.
47:15
But then, they finally pulled him out.
47:17
And then there was, I think there was a pyroclastic flow down that valley.
47:21
Some
47:23
eruption produced flowage deposit, and it destroyed the place where he'd been.
47:28
But then, Mount St. Helens got him.
47:30
Harry Glicken dodged the bullet at St. Helens, and then, he was
47:35
killed at Unzen Volcano in Japan by a pyroclastic flow when he was
47:42
accompanying the Crafts, a French couple that made movies of active eruptions.
47:51
Wow.
47:54
Now, when you returned to Andrews, you were up there,
47:59
what, ten days the first trip?
48:02
To Mount St. Helens?
48:03
Yeah.
48:04
Oh, no.
48:04
I just went for one or two days, and our trip was on day ten after the eruption.
48:13
You come back down, whatever the first time was that you went back
48:16
out to the Andrews or another project in the western Cascades.
48:20
What do you remember how you viewed what you were looking at?
48:24
Was it an immediate difference, or could you feel the edges of your preconceptions
48:29
that you'd had two weeks before or a month before changing immediately,
48:33
or what do you recall about that?
48:35
I don't really remember
48:39
anything like that.
48:41
But,
48:45
the Cascades,
48:49
both western and high Cascades, you know, it's all volcanic stuff.
48:56
So, I had thought I might experience a major forest fire in an area
49:04
very proximal to the Andrews within my professional lifetime.
49:08
And I was, at 1980, I'd been involved with fire history research in the area
49:15
based on counting trees rings on stumps, mostly by colleagues and grad students.
49:21
But working with them about taking the geologic mapping perspective and trying
49:26
to apply it for fire history maps.
49:30
And
49:35
so, I thought fire was the real common disturbance agent and I'd
49:41
likely be able to catch one of those.
49:45
Never would I have imagined something like St. Helens would
49:49
have occurred within my professional lifetime residency of this region.
49:55
And so, I just felt incredibly fortunate.
50:00
Despite the tragic aspects [deaths] , it was just an incredible learning
50:07
experience and awe-inspiring.
50:12
Did you think about all of the bodies that were probably buried
50:17
in these landscapes that you saw?
50:19
Did you ever think of that, or it was just like out of sight, out of mind?
50:24
I mean, you knew it had happened, you knew about Johnston, obviously, because
50:27
of his centrality in your discipline?
50:30
Well, I was certainly aware of the tragic aspects.
50:34
And it was so prominent in the media.
50:37
And I remember thinking, I'd like to go to the National Endowments for the Arts
50:43
and the Humanities and try to get money to bring in, sixteen or eighteen, or however
50:50
many seats there'd be in one of the big helicopters, and take a group of artists
50:56
and writers and fly them in, and have them
51:06
interpret the landscape and communicate about the landscape.
51:10
Because you could view it in terms of death and destruction, which
51:15
was the common media approach.
51:18
But there was also this incredible beauty and starkness, and all of
51:26
these little, fascinating things going on and the legacies, the
51:34
amazing survival that was occurring.
51:38
And
51:40
I remember having that thought and thinking of some candidate
51:44
people I'd like to invite, and Gary Snyder was one of them.
51:49
Well, it turned out that that worked out twenty years later, which was
51:53
actually an important seed towards doing the long-term Ecological Reflections.
51:58
The poets would have still been too scared to go in there.
52:01
[Laughter]
52:02
Oh, I don't know.
52:03
Maybe?
52:04
Actually, I kid my buddies like Charles Goodrich, poets are really important
52:12
disturbance agents, especially in the eastern European style, major
52:19
social activists.
52:21
As he is, for example, but a lot of others are as well.
52:25
Now, most people view the Earth as a relatively static thing, with the
52:29
exception of dramatic major disturbances like volcanic eruptions which
52:33
we've just mentioned, major floods, storms, etc. However, the earth does
52:38
move in slower, less obvious ways.
52:40
Much of your early work centered on measuring and analyzing
52:43
slowly moving earth dynamics.
52:45
Tell me about this work at the Andrews, in Oregon and elsewhere,
52:49
and kind of integrate to where we just came from and kind of invert
52:54
the discussion, if you will?
52:56
All right.
52:59
So I grew up in the east coast in
53:03
an old landscape that's sort of worn and tired, and not very active.
53:07
Although, geomorphically, it has some activity.
53:13
And so, it's been really interesting and fun for me to work in the west,
53:19
which is a much more active, the west is populated by much more active landscape
53:27
components, including mountains.
53:28
So, I think of the geo-eco interactions involving land forms as a physical
53:37
stage on which ecosystems perform, and geomorphic processes, those
53:44
processes that sculpt land forms over short or long periods of time,
53:51
as also active participants in the landscape.
53:57
So,
54:00
out here in our active landscapes with our volcanoes, landslides,
54:04
wind throw, and so forth,
54:09
things change.
54:11
Some things are very subtle.
54:12
On steep slopes, we may have the soil just sort of creeping along at a millimeter
54:16
a year, due to a variety of processes.
54:21
And I've been very interested in earth flows, which are
54:26
large, slow-moving landslides.
54:28
They may cover a square mile of landscape.
54:33
And where you have rocks with sufficient clay content and when
54:39
they're wet enough, then they may move downslope at a rate of millimeters to
54:47
quite a few meters per year, rafting along the roads and houses, in some
54:54
cases, forest and other vegetation, moving it along on their surface.
55:03
And so, we've been measuring movement of some of those.
55:09
In the Andrews?
55:10
In the Andrews and some other places.
55:15
We can interpret the land forms and see the head scarps, they're called, where
55:20
the land is pulled away, and then where there are bulbous toes pushing into
55:25
streams or out across river terraces, for example, at the lower ends.
55:32
They may completely disrupt stream networks and things like that on their
55:39
surfaces, and the trees may be tipped.
55:41
And we can interpret aspects of their movement history based on the records of
55:47
trees that have been deformed or ripped up the middle or one thing or another.
55:52
If you were going to do a sketch of the geology of the Andrews in relation
55:58
to bedrock and the earthflow dynamic, how would you give me a sketch?
56:07
The Andrews, which is 25 square miles, 64 square kilometers, 15,000 acres.
56:19
The southeast corner, which has ridges about 5,000 feet along its southern
56:27
border contain some U-shaped valleys and cirques carved by glaciers.
56:33
At the western end of the landscape, which is the lower elevation part,
56:38
and this is in certain types of volcanic rocks produced by mudflows
56:44
and landslides and pyroclastic flows,
56:49
those rocks tend to form very steep slopes and are prone to small debris slides
56:59
that may have volumes of hundreds to a few thousand cubic meters, move rapidly
57:05
down slopes and downstream channels.
57:08
So, that's a very intricately dissected landscape with mean slope
57:15
gradients of 34 to 35 degrees.
57:20
But then, in the central part of the Andrews, there are areas underlain
57:24
by weak rocks with sufficient clay content that they've been subjected
57:29
to these slow-moving landslide processes and the earthflows.
57:38
And so, the upper elevation half of the Andrews is in pretty-hard rocks,
57:43
younger lava flows, for the most part.
57:48
Basaltic-andesitic combination?
57:50
Yeah.
57:52
Okay.
57:53
Then the lower elevation half of the landscape is underlain
57:58
by these weaker rocks, prone to different styles of land-sliding.
58:03
And of course, then the rivers are carrying the
58:06
sediment and the detritus out.
58:11
Now, the rock where you are is older than, for instance, just to the east
58:19
where you have the larger volcanoes and the high crest of the Cascades.
58:25
How did the more recent eruptions from those younger mountains and younger
58:31
processes, how does that interface with what you see at the Andrews,
58:35
in which there seems to be a break about where the McKenzie River comes
58:38
through just to the east in terms of age and activity and types of rock?
58:43
Correct?
58:44
So, if you're standing on the eastern boundary of the Andrews on the ridge
58:49
at about 5,000 feet, you look down on a southward flowing McKenzie River.
59:00
The river flows to the south along a fault that separates the younger
59:07
High Cascades to the east from the older western Cascades to the west.
59:14
Standing on that ridge at 5,000 feet, you're standing on lava flows that are
59:18
something like 3.5 million years old, and which had flowed to the west from
59:26
sources that are no longer exposed.
59:29
There had been faulting at that boundary with uplift beneath our feet standing on
59:36
that ridge, relative to quite a bit of down-drop in the area that's now occupied
59:42
by lava flows and stratovolcanoes like Three Sisters and Three-Fingered Jack
59:51
and Jefferson and Washington that are immediately to the east of that point.
59:56
Most of those structures visible from there are less than a couple million
1:00:01
years old, and those landforms are for the most part, constructional volcanic
1:00:11
landforms; broad shield volcanoes and those stratovolcanoes
1:00:17
in coalescing lava flows.
1:00:18
You have a broad platform at about 5,000 feet, but then another 5,000 feet of
1:00:23
big volcano sitting up on top of it.
1:00:26
So, those big peaks are around 10,000 feet.
1:00:30
Now, a lot of the rocks that are in Andrews in the western Cascades
1:00:35
emanated from more intrusive igneous processes, correct?
1:00:39
No, they were extrusive.
1:00:40
Oh, they were, okay.
1:00:41
For the most part.
1:00:46
There are intrusive bodies just to the west of the Andrews in the area
1:00:51
of the Blue River Mining District.
1:00:52
So, that must have been at the head of Mona Creek, which is
1:00:57
immediately across from the Andrews.
1:01:00
In terms of the base rock, the mineral composition, how that affects the
1:01:06
detritus, the break-down of the soils, how does that affect the ecology of
1:01:10
the Andrews specifically, maybe doing a little contrast with the younger Cascades
1:01:15
just to the east in terms of the base
1:01:20
material that would produce what it produces?
1:01:25
Well,
1:01:28
I think it's fair to say, although we haven't had people really investigate
1:01:33
this, that the composition of the rock, its chemical composition,
1:01:42
isn't creating a strong differentiation in the vegetation types.
1:01:49
But the rock, what we call volcanoclastic rocks, fragmental rocks of the
1:02:00
mud flows and pyroclastic flows and landslide origin that makes up the
1:02:10
bedrock in the lower elevation half of the Andrews, that contains
1:02:17
enough clay minerals that the resulting soils from those bedrock
1:02:23
materials have sufficient clays
1:02:28
of types that are prone to shrinking and swelling with drying and wetting.
1:02:36
Hence, they are prone to landslide.
1:02:41
So, through those mechanisms, then the type of rock influences the type of soil,
1:02:48
which influences the types of soil-moving processes, and those soil movement
1:02:53
processes can affect the vegetation through disturbance process mechanisms.
1:03:01
Those clay minerals and those soils affect soil moisture conditions
1:03:08
and other factors that influence the composition of the vegetation.
1:03:15
Of course, the geologic underpinnings influence the resulting topography, and
1:03:23
the resulting topography has a lot to say about the distribution of forest
1:03:28
types, and especially forest age classes.
1:03:31
You know, how wildfire, for example, moved across the landscape and
1:03:36
determined where we have very old forest and where we have young forest
1:03:42
as a result of the variation in fire regimes, and tendency for the winds
1:03:53
to topple trees or blow out limbs and make them susceptible to invasion and rots.
1:04:00
And so, when we look at the LIDAR images and see how the tallest trees
1:04:06
in the Andrews are distributed across the landscape, we can see them sort
1:04:10
of tucked down in the valleys and in places that are somewhat protected
1:04:15
from the spread of fire and the passage of winds that might damage the trees.
1:04:25
How would you characterize the fire history?
1:04:27
A little take-off from what you just mentioned there.
1:04:30
There hasn't been a major fire that's taken the whole landscape,
1:04:35
but there have been fires around the periphery in historic times.
1:04:38
Right?
1:04:39
Well, we've done a lot of work on fire history, and the first way we looked at it
1:04:47
had to do with counting tree rings on stumps.
1:04:49
So, for a long time, the Forest Service has been making a lot of beautiful stumps.
1:04:54
And
1:04:59
you could count these very old trees.
1:05:02
There are problems with the very old ones, you know, those that were 700 or
1:05:07
800 years old, they really are packing in the rings in those later centuries.
1:05:14
And so, counting on the stump was not very good and subject to quite a bit of error,
1:05:22
although recently, a Ph.D. student, Alan Tepley, did a wonderful job of dating,
1:05:34
using high-resolution dating techniques, taking tree cores and
1:05:40
bringing them back and preparing them and counting under the scope.
1:05:43
But anyway, by looking at the distribution of age classes of Douglas-fir across
1:05:49
the landscape, and most of our studies have extended beyond the Andrews proper,
1:05:55
because big fires could be very extensive.
1:05:58
To get a landscape picture, you need to look at a big area.
1:06:03
So, there's a tension there between intensive versus extensive sampling.
1:06:09
Having high-resolution dating versus having a lot of lower resolution
1:06:13
dating, but covering a lot of ground.
1:06:16
We aren't making stumps any more of the native forest, which is the fire
1:06:23
regime we're trying to reconstruct.
1:06:25
But anyway, we've done stuff that's been surprising, and aspects of the surprises
1:06:32
are still not understood, not explained.
1:06:36
But we had quite a bit of fire 400-500 years ago and 100-200 years ago, and then,
1:06:44
we have several centuries, the 1600s and 1700's, where there wasn't much fire.
1:06:50
And then, at about 12 percent of our study sites, you can see
1:06:56
some trees greater than 550.
1:06:59
We refer to that as super-old growth, inasmuch as well into the 800's.
1:07:07
So, there must be some climate signals in these fire history patterns.
1:07:16
So, early Euro-people, homesteaders, travelers, settlers, may have
1:07:24
influenced the fire history from the middle of the 19th century forward.
1:07:32
Then we have sheep grazing in the late 19th century and early 20th century,
1:07:38
along ridgelines and using meadows, and there may have been some fire.
1:07:42
Started from that?
1:07:43
Yeah.
1:07:44
And for the Andrews, then, mostly of old growth on the long north-facing slope
1:07:53
on the south side of the watershed, we had a fair amount of fire in the
1:07:57
mid-19th century, probably multiple events, but scattered and variable.
1:08:05
Then we had some fires around Carpenter Mountain, high on the
1:08:08
ridge and off to the north, and then burned up out in the McKenzie Valley
1:08:13
on the long hot south-facing slope, and slopped over into the Andrews.
1:08:21
Now, most of these fires were in the pre-1910 era, when the Forest
1:08:29
Service after the big blow-up of 1910, started putting everything out.
1:08:33
Yeah.
1:08:34
So, the fuel load dynamic automatically started building up
1:08:38
across all Forest Service land.
1:08:41
Most of these happened before then, the modern Forest Service fire
1:08:46
management philosophy and practice.
1:08:48
Correct?
1:08:50
Yes.
1:08:51
The scenario I just was depicting was for the
1:09:04
pre-suppression period.
1:09:08
There's a very interesting master's thesis by Connie Burke, 1979, I believe.
1:09:13
It was in geography at OSU, and she
1:09:17
did an archival study of all written records she could find that were relevant
1:09:24
to interpreting the effects, which occurred from fire and human activities,
1:09:30
that might have affected the time and space distributions of fire occurrence.
1:09:36
Right.
1:09:37
That included going and getting all of the fire suppression records from Willamette
1:09:43
National Forest for her study area, which ran from the crest of the Cascades, a
1:09:50
big square area, and the Andrews sits right in the middle of it, then off to
1:09:55
the west a-ways, and then up to the south Santiam drainage, and then, down towards,
1:10:02
what's now occupied by Cougar Reservoir.
1:10:03
She
1:10:06
looked at suppression records for, I think it was 1910-1977.
1:10:13
Lots of fire.
1:10:16
Lots of lightning fire, maybe an equal number of
1:10:20
-- Of human-caused?
1:10:20
Human-caused of many different sorts.
1:10:24
Escaped homesteader fire, escaped/fire, escaped/can fire, arson.
1:10:31
You have to wonder about how good those interpretations [fire origin]
1:10:36
are because lots of people are making them, and there'd be lots of reasons,
1:10:42
political and other kinds of reasons, for
1:10:44
-- Legal?
1:10:45
Misinterpreting.
1:10:46
Right.
1:10:49
So, when we say we have a suppression period, we have to be careful about
1:10:54
that because, you know, detection and access, and staffing and tools to
1:11:04
deal with fire, gradually and slowly
1:11:08
-- Built up.
1:11:09
Built up over time.
1:11:11
And
1:11:15
granted we didn't have big fires in the Andrews.
1:11:20
But it's been interesting in the last few decades, there have been quite a
1:11:25
few 5,000-10,000-acre fires, and even larger, in the general neighborhood.
1:11:35
So, if you look at the remote sensing work that Warren Cohen and colleagues
1:11:39
have done, which uses satellite imagery since '72, you see a big swath
1:11:46
of historic fires over the post-'72 period, from down in the Kalmiopsis,
1:11:54
the Silver Fire and the Biscuit and so forth, wrapping up into the Cascades,
1:11:59
up to Santiam Pass and the B & B Fire.
1:12:02
That was the one that happened up there by Three Fingered Jack and
1:12:05
Mt. Washington and all that area.
1:12:06
Yeah.
1:12:07
So, there's a very distinct swath with lots of fires, many of them
1:12:11
in the 5,000-10,000 [acre range]
1:12:13
. The B & B was really big, though?
1:12:15
Yeah, that was 50,000 or 60,000 [acres]
1:12:17
. Right.
1:12:17
And then we had the Warner Creek
1:12:22
and several others down at the south end of the Willamette.
1:12:28
That raises very interesting issues as to how,
1:12:34
if we have warming, more warming, how that will affect change in fire regimes.
1:12:43
And will that apparent boundary, and I don't know what the climatic
1:12:49
metrics are that would define that boundary relative to fire, if
1:12:55
that were to move to the west and northwest, we might be in the hot seat.
1:13:04
Okay, we're going to return to the LTER, the IBP/EER/LTER transition.
1:13:11
I want you to take us into the actual LTER era.
1:13:16
We've frittered around, or we've kind of nibbled around
1:13:19
the edge, and looked at that.
1:13:21
But I want you to take us into there.
1:13:23
When we started this interview, kind of the transition from you describing
1:13:26
the campus location and the land clearing and the reason for that.
1:13:30
But let's kind of go full circle and come back and really go into the LTER dynamic.
1:13:38
Jerry, Dick Waring, to you, any of the other foundational people.
1:13:42
And let's say, let's go through LTER 1 and even go into LTER 2 and how the
1:13:49
Andrews formed and became the Andrews in that early phase, but also the network
1:13:55
and how this all played together.
1:13:59
Okay.
1:14:02
I wasn't real central at that time.
1:14:06
I had, because of my discipline as a geologist, and
1:14:14
then I'd been a post-doc.
1:14:16
Then in the late-'70s, I came on with the PNW Station.
1:14:22
So, some other people would be better sources, particularly Jerry,
1:14:27
because he was our central leader.
1:14:29
Dick Waring had been an important leader, teaming with Jerry in the IBP era.
1:14:35
Then he went off to do more of his own thing,
1:14:42
which involved a project called OTTER, which was the "Oregon Transect," where
1:14:50
it ran from Cascade Head right out at the coast, the Coast Range across the
1:14:55
Cascades, and over onto the east side.
1:14:59
He was tapping in on NASA money to do remote sensing work and trying to
1:15:05
make ecological, eco-physiological interpretations, and tie that
1:15:11
in with climate measurements, and things of this nature.
1:15:15
So, he budded off and did more his thing, whereas, Jerry was increasingly and
1:15:26
conspicuously, the leader of the group.
1:15:28
And
1:15:33
Art McKee was very pivotal as the guy who was there for facilities development
1:15:42
and the interactions with NSF.
1:15:44
The key LTER leader at NSF was Tom Callahan, and Art had been lab
1:15:52
partners with him at the University of Georgia as grad students.
1:15:59
Was Callahan at Coweta at one time?
1:16:02
I don't know what his Coweta connections were.
1:16:05
Because of the Georgia location, obviously?
1:16:12
I just don't know.
1:16:13
It's a very good question I hadn't thought about before.
1:16:17
He went to NSF, and he was a long-time, sort of a lifer at NSF, which I believe
1:16:25
was quite an advantage to have somebody with a persistent tenure in the context
1:16:33
of program officership that tended to be rotators, people would come in for
1:16:38
a year or two and go back out, which made for a strange dynamic, I expect.
1:16:45
I was never there on that basis.
1:16:49
Jerry did go in for a couple years to learn the system, so that
1:16:54
he could then tap it better and influence it better on down the road,
1:17:01
which he certainly did, and he was very influential in the
1:17:06
instigation and evolution of LTER and other pieces of business.
1:17:13
But you as an observer, a person that, you were doing your St. Helens
1:17:17
work, and Andrews was becoming a more stable, known institution.
1:17:24
It had survived from the '60s and '70s into an actual ecological research site.
1:17:30
Yeah.
1:17:31
The IBP was short-lived, but something more real and long-lasting was coming on.
1:17:37
You were witnessing this.
1:17:38
And eventually, you would become the PI for the Andrews by the late '80s, correct?
1:17:44
Yeah, '86-'87.
1:17:47
So, I mean
1:17:48
-- I did have the things I worked on,
1:17:54
in the latter part of IBP, '75-'76-'77, in the context of a
1:18:01
lot of work on wood and streams.
1:18:06
Then, the River Continuum Project began, which involved sites in Idaho,
1:18:12
Michigan, southeastern Pennsylvania, as well as the Andrews, and Jim
1:18:20
Sedell was the leader for the Andrews.
1:18:23
That was '77-'78-'79, and I was good buddies with Jim and worked
1:18:30
in the stream ecology scene.
1:18:33
I had grown up and my parents still lived in Wilmington, north of Wilmington,
1:18:37
Delaware, so I would go back and visit Robin Vannote, who was the overall
1:18:43
lead and the guy who was the leader of the southeastern Pennsylvania site.
1:18:47
And so, I'd go up and visit him and go wandering the rolling hills of the
1:18:54
Brandywine country, which I loved.
1:18:56
I'd go up there when I was in high school and college, and go to the
1:19:04
Wyeth country and see exhibits of the Wyeth family's work and stuff like that.
1:19:10
So, anyway,
1:19:14
I was in early LTER.
1:19:17
I was working quite a bit with the stream people on an experiment we had.
1:19:24
I certainly had the slang of the riparian rip-off study.
1:19:29
We had been thinking a lot about forest-stream interactions and the role
1:19:35
of forests in regulating the structure of the stream channel and its ability
1:19:41
to retain particulate organic matter.
1:19:44
The more big wood in the system, and little wood, the more retention of
1:19:49
organic matter and more food there for the invertebrates that munched on that.
1:19:57
So, the role of the forest in structuring the channel, and also,
1:20:01
the role of the forest in regulating light inputs, water temperature, and
1:20:07
especially light for primary production.
1:20:11
Ken Cummins was the leader of the stream group in that time
1:20:16
period, and a major theme for him was functional feeding groups.
1:20:21
The invertebrate community was large and diverse, but you could
1:20:25
group them by what they ate.
1:20:27
Who were the leaf-shredders, and who were the scrapers who were scraping
1:20:34
algae and diatoms off rocks, and who were the net-spinners, the collectors.
1:20:44
The theme of the River Continuum Project is that you move from the
1:20:48
headwaters under forest cover down to large rivers, and as the rivers got
1:20:55
wider, the forest cover pulled back.
1:20:58
The forest influence was diminished on both the structure and the light levels
1:21:06
and the light increase, so there'd be this continuum of variation and the
1:21:15
aquatic community composition, and the measures of ecosystem processing,
1:21:23
P:R ratios and things like that.
1:21:27
So, we had an experiment where we were going to try to remove
1:21:32
the structure influence,
1:21:37
but retain the shading, and then remove the shading, but retain
1:21:43
the structure, and then have both.
1:21:47
And we designed this experiment and were making observations.
1:21:50
In the end, the experiment was to be implemented through a timber sale.
1:21:56
But the timber sale was in a piece of ground that was then precluded
1:22:02
from logging because of RARE II.
1:22:07
The Roadless Area Review process said this was a large enough unroaded
1:22:13
area that it wasn't to be logged.
1:22:16
And that was is '84, connected to the Wilderness Act legislation, RARE I
1:22:21
or RARE II, directly or indirectly?
1:22:24
I believe so, but I don't know.
1:22:27
I don't remember whether it was RARE I or RARE II, but anyway,
1:22:31
that stopped that experiment.
1:22:36
But meanwhile, I was doing all my other things, other disturbance
1:22:40
stuff, and we did have a book that came out, I think, in '82, which
1:22:47
was the synthesis volume for the
1:22:52
International Biological Program era of the Coniferous Forest Biome.
1:22:58
So, it includes the work of both the Seattle people and the Corvallis people.
1:23:04
I think, I haven't thought about it until just now, but I think that was
1:23:09
really pivotal in helping to cement my role in our ecosystem group.
1:23:15
Because I was the lead author on two chapters, one that was synthetic
1:23:23
about soil and sediment routing through the watersheds, both the
1:23:26
organic and the inorganic components.
1:23:30
So, it was at the real geophysical-ecological interface.
1:23:34
And the other one was on forest-stream interactions.
1:23:39
And so,
1:23:42
it was synthetic about this notion of
1:23:45
all the ways the forest affects the stream.
1:23:50
I think that helped cement my role, my relevance to the ecosystem group.
1:23:58
So, I was doing those kinds of things in that earliest LTER period.
1:24:06
Was there a feeling of permanence or long-term, in terms of
1:24:11
the institutional stability?
1:24:13
I mean, the
1:24:15
IBP did last, what 10-12 years, in terms of the sites here [U.S.] , anyway.
1:24:22
Was there a feeling at the beginning, it's another try at that, or was
1:24:27
there a reason to believe that long-term really meant that long-term,
1:24:31
it was going to really last?
1:24:32
My
1:24:36
perception, and I don't remember sitting down and having a serious
1:24:40
over-a-brew conversation about it.
1:24:47
But I have been thinking about it because I just had to write
1:24:51
it for this essay for a book.
1:24:53
But
1:24:58
IBP, I came on in '72, some of my colleagues or post-docs, or Stan, a
1:25:06
grad student, came on in maybe '71.
1:25:08
We were just assembling in '72, and IBP was sort of winding down by '77.
1:25:18
So, it wasn't that long.
1:25:20
We did continue to do work together in different contexts, and Dick Waring
1:25:25
and Jerry Franklin were vigorous in trying to find more stable positions
1:25:32
for those of us that had been post-docs.
1:25:35
But that's how you ended up with the Forest Service, though.
1:25:37
Correct?
1:25:37
Correct.
1:25:38
Yes.
1:25:38
Correct.
1:25:40
Several guys got OSU appointments and some people like Jim
1:25:44
Sedell went off and worked for
1:25:49
Weyerhaeuser, and then, came back to Forest Service research.
1:25:56
So,
1:25:59
I felt pretty stable myself having my Forest Service scientist position,
1:26:06
whether or not we would continue as a research group, certainly
1:26:09
got a boost when LTER came on.
1:26:12
So, that strengthened the PNW Station's mission, at the least the
1:26:16
Corvallis share, right, of the station?
1:26:20
The station was quite solid in Corvallis.
1:26:28
I'm
1:26:34
just trying to think through this.
1:26:35
I had my deep roots in the Andrews, first as a post-doc, and then
1:26:42
continued there as a PNW employee.
1:26:46
Some of the other PNW people who worked there, and Jerry was PNW through and
1:26:53
through, and Andrews through and through.
1:26:59
There were some people in our watershed research unit like Dennis
1:27:03
Harr and Dick Fredriksen, who had had some affiliations with IBP.
1:27:15
And that was also funded by the NSF in part, right?
1:27:20
IBP?
1:27:20
Yeah.
1:27:21
Yes.
1:27:23
So, what differentiated the connections with the NSF with the IBP and LTER?
1:27:29
Just stronger, more institutional fabric and strength, or how would
1:27:36
you describe the difference?
1:27:39
I would say, in the IBP, which for me was '72 to '77,
1:27:48
and at that time, the Andrews had been primarily
1:27:54
PNW turf, and here comes these young bucks through IBP through NSF
1:28:02
funding doing things that were not being done by the Forest Service
1:28:07
researchers, although interfacing.
1:28:11
And as I think I said before, really appreciated and was impressed
1:28:18
by the willingness of the PNW researchers and technicians to
1:28:25
accept us fuzzy-faced guys into
1:28:33
their territory, including experimental watersheds like No.
1:28:38
10, which is pretty tight quarters, but we all cooperated.
1:28:43
In the LTER, my impression is that the place of the academics was
1:28:52
stronger, more fully accepted.
1:28:56
New studies were commencing at their initiative.
1:29:00
And there were people such as myself who didn't distinguish my Forest Service-ness
1:29:07
from my university-ness, and I looked like and functioned in some ways more like
1:29:15
-- A professor?
1:29:16
-- an academic-type person.
1:29:19
So anyway, I think that the inception of LTER
1:29:25
solidified our community.
1:29:29
We weren't looking at an end to the work.
1:29:34
We had no idea how long it would last
1:29:39
there.
1:29:41
You know, we had seen IBP end.
1:29:43
We knew ends, endings could occur.
1:29:48
The tradition of NSF was two-year, individual investigator,
1:29:54
curiosity-drive research grants.
1:29:57
Right.
1:29:57
They were ad hoc, here-there.
1:29:59
Yeah, and that if you promoted the social and management relevance of the
1:30:09
work, it was likely to get knocked down by the reviewers who were academics.
1:30:17
And
1:30:19
they could easily say, well, the Forest Service should fund that, or
1:30:22
some action agency could fund that.
1:30:24
That shouldn't be the purview of NSF funding.
1:30:30
Through time, and especially at the insistence of the senator from Maryland,
1:30:38
the tiny, little lady, Barbara Mikulski.
1:30:43
Who is still there?
1:30:43
She's still there.
1:30:45
I was watching her during the shut-down, feisty and straight-talking as ever.
1:30:51
Anyway, she pushed NSF hard to display the relevance of the work.
1:30:57
So, now we have two evaluation criteria, intellectual merit
1:31:01
and broader impacts, which
1:31:05
plays in spades to the kinds of work we do.
1:31:10
I think our whole history at the Andrews is such that
1:31:17
our work, so much of our work, has found relevance, even the stuff that
1:31:21
started out seemingly extremely basic and irrelevant, turned out to be
1:31:26
pre-relevant and got hyper-relevant.
1:31:31
Partly, that's a matter of the context in which we have lived.
1:31:36
Now, speaking of the transition from an experimental forest to what it became,
1:31:42
what kind of lag effect did you see in terms of cuts, timber sales, and things
1:31:51
that would drag on into the '80s and even the '90s, I think, that were maybe
1:32:00
questionable or questioned in the context of scientists and ecological science, who
1:32:07
were seeing this laboratory essentially unfold as a laboratory, rather than a
1:32:14
traditional experimental forest which it originally was for, really 20-25 years?
1:32:20
So, you're talking about the Andrews Forest property itself?
1:32:25
Yes.
1:32:25
Okay, my take, and if somebody wants to answer this rigorously, they should go
1:32:34
and look at the records that do exist.
1:32:36
But my take is that there was an agreement to establish the experimental
1:32:42
forest between the station [PNW] and the region , and then the national forest
1:32:47
[Willamette] . That included provisions that 20 million board-feet a year would
1:32:51
come out, partly because Lookout Creek was to be cut early, and Upper Blue River
1:33:02
was to be not cut for a while because of work that the Corps of Engineers was
1:33:08
doing at the upper part of Upper Blue River Drainage on a snow hydrology study.
1:33:15
Anyway, there was this agreement to log in the Andrews, and it took place, and it
1:33:22
got the main backbone of our road network in, which we definitely used in spades,
1:33:32
continuing to this day and into the future.
1:33:35
And
1:33:37
which our dependence on it became especially clear in the '96
1:33:42
flood, when the flood knocked out important pieces of it.
1:33:48
So anyway, that logging did proceed.
1:33:51
My impression is it was a little slow to get started in
1:33:55
the late '40s and earliest '50s
1:33:58
for some reasons that I don't fully understand, but I think Roy Silen
1:34:02
and the challenges of putting in some big cuts which the whole system
1:34:07
was new to, gave it a slow start.
1:34:11
They proceeded in the '50s and '60s, and then in the fairly early '70s,
1:34:20
the amount of logging was really trimmed back.
1:34:23
I remember in the process of running the Andrews Forest, we were supposed to
1:34:30
have a five-year timber management plan, and had that vetted in certain ways.
1:34:37
And it was part, I believe, I don't know how much of it was a strictly Forest
1:34:43
Service process, or if it was part of the arrangement with NSF to have,
1:34:53
to meet their stipulations of continuing it as a major place
1:34:58
of investment of NSF dollars.
1:35:00
I think NSF imposed some restrictions that Jerry and Art McKee can address
1:35:07
much better because they were in the thick of doing that, and I
1:35:11
think the presence of Art McKee, a
1:35:15
forest director [H.J. Andrews] , the onsite presence, was a really-critical
1:35:20
factor in that earliest LTER period.
1:35:26
What was there physically in 1980, when this LTER started?
1:35:30
What was the actual infrastructure?
1:35:32
You had the roads, obviously, and you had
1:35:34
-- ? We had gauging stations and trail stations.
1:35:37
And trailers, right?
1:35:38
Or
1:35:40
-- Or were you still outside of the boundaries at that time?
1:35:44
I think they were mostly outside the boundaries.
1:35:46
Because in the '80s, you started bringing in the trailers, right?
1:35:48
Yeah.
1:35:49
And they [trailers] were also at the campus area, or were they below that?
1:35:54
When you say campus, what does that mean?
1:35:56
Where, the flats area, the
1:36:00
area there by Lookout Creek, the flats, in that area there in that little valley.
1:36:02
I think it was
1:36:03
-- Is that where the trailers were?
1:36:05
Yes.
1:36:05
Okay.
1:36:07
So,
1:36:11
I remember a discussion when it was decided that we weren't going to
1:36:15
just have a regular timber program.
1:36:18
I don't remember the date.
1:36:20
I do remember a discussion of, wow, how much, what's the value of the
1:36:28
timber out there on the hoof, on the stump, the standing timber?
1:36:34
And I remember, I don't know where it came from, but somebody said, "Well,
1:36:38
it's probably half a billion dollars."
1:36:40
You mean, things that would be left uncut if you changed the mission
1:36:44
statement for this experiment?
1:36:46
What is the value of the timber, standing timber, out there today?
1:36:49
Right.
1:36:49
And if we stop cutting, that's standing there and we might
1:36:53
get some serious blow-back.
1:36:57
I remember a discussion of that.
1:37:02
A little bit of cutting did occur for experimental purposes.
1:37:07
There was the Snowbrush Study, which was to be an LTER study that Phil
1:37:14
Sollins was the lead scientist on.
1:37:16
It was implemented with two clear-cuts with hot burns, and we expected
1:37:22
Ceanothus velutinus [Snowbrush] to come in, and so, there could be a nitrogen,
1:37:27
fixing nitrogen capital-related study.
1:37:31
That study never really bore fruit, scientifically.
1:37:38
Some follow-up work was done and it didn't come in heavy to Ceanothus as
1:37:43
we'd expected, and as had occurred in some nearby cuts and burns.
1:37:51
Now, that's up at the high area, correct?
1:37:54
It's on the road getting close to the, not the road to Carpenter, but
1:37:59
the road to Watersheds 6, 7 and 8.
1:38:03
You know, another one was a study put in by Steve Radosevich and
1:38:08
Dave Hibbs on the Mack Creek Road, where there were a couple cuts.
1:38:13
It was part of a study that also included installations at Cascade Head Experimental
1:38:18
Forest and one in the Olympic Peninsula in the Puget Sound lowlands, where
1:38:24
there were different inter-plantings of Douglas-fir and red alder to look
1:38:31
at their interactions in terms of relative growth and nitrogen fixation
1:38:35
by red alder and things of this nature.
1:38:39
And there was, there were a few cuts put in for logs to install Mark
1:38:49
Harmon's log decomposition experiment.
1:38:52
So, there was a little bit of that.
1:38:54
There were also some thinning implantations as part of experiments.
1:39:00
Of experimental studies, correct?
1:39:00
Dave Perry's
1:39:03
young stand study, for example, and, also, the young stand
1:39:09
thinning and diversity study.
1:39:10
So, there was some plantation thinning studies.
1:39:14
There's now discussion of thinning in one or a couple older plantations
1:39:22
for demonstration and some experimentation on ecological forestry.
1:39:29
It is very interesting to think of this issue of further cutting.
1:39:33
People we've interacted recently include the relatively new dean of the [OSU]
1:39:38
College of Forestry, Thomas Maness.
1:39:44
He's very concerned, or interested in having a "working
1:39:48
forest landscape" initiative.
1:39:51
What's a working forest?
1:39:53
And there's debate and dispute about this.
1:39:56
I also recollect this question, is the Andrews a "working forest" or not?
1:40:03
And I
1:40:06
remember when Bob Buckman, a Forest Service administrator,
1:40:12
and early in his career when he was a silviculture researcher,
1:40:19
going and interacting with Canadians when they wanted to
1:40:24
set up a model forest system.
1:40:30
This leads to a very critical point about the history of the Andrews, and
1:40:35
it's the potential that it could lead to and contribute to a paradigm shift.
1:40:44
That is,
1:40:47
does a model forest or experimental forest, model contemporary
1:40:55
management, perhaps with a slight edge towards innovation?
1:41:01
Or, is it a research outfit learning new stuff maybe with some
1:41:09
manipulation, but not necessarily managing the whole property as a
1:41:15
model of best management practices?
1:41:19
We started out with the Andrews with two decades of sort of modeling best
1:41:25
practices and some experimentation.
1:41:28
If we had continued, we would now have very little of the
1:41:35
Andrews in native forest.
1:41:37
We would have logged
1:41:40
two-thirds of it and we would have had blow-down in leave blocks, and
1:41:46
we would have chased blow-down.
1:41:49
And that would have just left scraps, which would have been diminished
1:41:54
in any representation of interior forest habitat by microclimatic edge
1:41:59
effects and other things like that.
1:42:01
We would have spent the native forest learning resource.
1:42:08
What we did have was we had a couple decades of that active management.
1:42:18
The economic forestry paradigm.
1:42:20
Right.
1:42:21
Dominant?
1:42:21
Right.
1:42:23
And then we reverted to an ecosystem research-dominated system.
1:42:32
When we were in the working forest mode, we were dependent on that
1:42:39
management paradigm and the tweaking of it, but not too big a tweaking,
1:42:45
but in a tweaking for efficiency.
1:42:50
We were dependent on the management paradigm of the day.
1:42:54
But in 1970-72 when we flipped over to IBP and a lot of NSF funding,
1:42:59
independent, walled-off from the management paradigm of the day, we
1:43:05
could establish enough of a track record in that world and in the Mount
1:43:11
St. Helens world, and become a force.
1:43:17
So, we were flowing information out into the contemporary management world,
1:43:25
still operating in that timber-era management paradigm, we were offering the
1:43:31
input that could tweak it and so forth.
1:43:33
But we were independent of it, so that the work we did had the potential for
1:43:45
being revolutionary and for the dramatic shift of that management paradigm.
1:43:52
Without that, I doubt that would have ever happened.
1:43:56
We wouldn't have been able to provide the talking points, the frames of
1:44:05
old growth, Eric Forsman's spotted owl, a lot of the watershed work
1:44:13
that became the fulcrums for that incredible paradigm shift.
1:44:23
And then, if we hadn't done all that research, when it came time to draft the
1:44:30
Northwest Forest Plan, which wasn't just about owls, and it wasn't just about
1:44:36
old growth, the framing of the Northwest Forest Plan and the landscape thinking,
1:44:42
the adaptive management thinking, all of these kinds of topics imbedded in
1:44:52
Northwest Forest Plan as a synthesis and integration product, if we hadn't done all
1:44:59
that wild and wooly work, in the context of the Andrews as an ecosystem research
1:45:07
center and think-tank community, how would there have been a paradigm shift?
1:45:15
How would the plan have been framed, formulated, blueprinted?
1:45:24
So, anyway,
1:45:27
the start of IBP and then with the carrying on through the community
1:45:33
continuity that LTER has provided, has been incredibly productive.
1:45:40
And also, operating in the NSF-LTER world means that we are constantly
1:45:46
on edge to innovate, to do that tough balance of the persistence of the
1:45:54
long-term measurements and experiments, at the same time we're trying to
1:46:00
be innovative and forward-looking.
1:46:03
That's a real tension there.
1:46:05
We're kept in check every three years, a six-year funding cycle
1:46:10
of renewals and mid-term reviews.
1:46:12
Also, if your information management is up-to-snuff, and that people
1:46:17
can find your data online.
1:46:19
The Forest Service doesn't have any review processes with those kinds
1:46:26
of live- or-die teeth to produce, to make your data high-quality,
1:46:34
documented, publicly-accessible,
1:46:39
and published in high-profile outlets.
1:46:42
All those things, our feet are held to the fire by NSF processes.
1:46:48
In other words, the precepts of behaviorism may have become unpopular
1:46:54
in how to raise your children, but they motivate scientists?
1:46:59
[Laughs] Is that a good way of characterizing it, to produce?
1:47:03
Yeah.
1:47:04
Okay.
1:47:06
Now, the culture.
1:47:07
When did the LTER become a culture?
1:47:11
I mean, obviously, there's people that were colleagues and friends,
1:47:14
and going back '50s,'60s, '70s, and the IBP had a culture to it.
1:47:20
But when did the LTER become a culture, and you could see this is a community
1:47:25
and something is happening here?
1:47:29
And you can localize if you want to.
1:47:32
Well, I've been working on this essay, and my first line is, "What is LTER?" I look
1:47:42
at the Bioscience issue from 2012 that has
1:47:49
a special collection of papers about LTER,
1:47:56
and so, that is the most current reflection, it seems to me, of what is
1:48:07
LTER.
1:48:07
And it's still dominated by long-term studies and saying that, oh, we're
1:48:15
doing future scenarios, we have relevance to policy and management, but
1:48:19
it's really about long-term studies.
1:48:21
Because we have NSF dollars, and that's what NSF's about.
1:48:26
But my point in the beginning of this essay is that the biggest
1:48:32
accomplishment is that it is a culture.
1:48:36
There is a community of a couple thousand people from grad students and some
1:48:40
undergrads, research experience for undergrads, through senior scientists, and
1:48:44
retirees, all stages, who are part of this culture of open, sharing of ideas, sharing
1:48:55
of leadership roles, sharing of data.
1:48:59
It becomes most clear to me
1:49:04
how big an accomplishment this is when I interact in the context of ILTER,
1:49:13
International LTER, and seeing how challenging it is for colleagues.
1:49:17
And some of the places I know the most about are Japan, Tasmania and the rest
1:49:23
of Australia, and Taiwan and China;
1:49:30
the difficulties of establishing LTER-like systems in their
1:49:34
other science-culture-societal funding kinds of contexts.
1:49:42
So, you asked, when did we realize this culture?
1:49:47
When did we realize that we have this culture?
1:49:53
My feeling is we haven't realized it yet very much.
1:49:57
And then there are aspects, I feel like we're still quite constrained by
1:50:02
working off NSF funding, although we have Forest Service funding and we'd
1:50:05
like to get NEH and NEA and other kinds of funding, so that the funding
1:50:12
sphere sources are commensurate with the larger societal
1:50:19
cultural enterprise that we have.
1:50:22
And we can be stronger and more explicit about some of these dimensions
1:50:27
that are outside the framing that NSF or the Forest Service might see
1:50:33
as what is appropriate for us to do.
1:50:35
But anyway, at the site level, it was very organic because
1:50:40
you're living with one another.
1:50:42
And if you can throw a frisbee and have pizza parties with your team-mates,
1:50:49
families and stuff like that, then you get a sense of common ground.
1:50:55
Though we don't do very much socially, we have had times when
1:50:58
we've had social interactions.
1:51:00
So, at the site level, there's been that sense for a long time.
1:51:05
And a lot of it centers around the place and some of the
1:51:07
activities that we do at a place.
1:51:10
And then there is proposal writing.
1:51:11
That really forces you to get in the sandbox together and play together, and
1:51:16
not throw sand in each other's faces.
1:51:18
And you have, it's a very interesting lens.
1:51:24
You want to have a successful proposal.
1:51:26
You're dependent on one another.
1:51:28
Interdisciplinarity is a crux of success or failure.
1:51:32
And everybody does have their own little interests at the
1:51:35
same time, the tension there?
1:51:37
Right.
1:51:38
So, you're constantly balancing the long-term with the short-term, with a
1:51:44
hot topic, with a boring, old continuity, with the diversity of focus lengths of all
1:51:54
kinds, you know, disciplinary emphases.
1:51:57
So, it's a constant challenge.
1:52:01
So, then NSF forced us to begin to function as a network.
1:52:05
And there was a lot of resistance from some quarters to do that.
1:52:09
People said, "Hey, we competed as a site and we entered this group as a site.
1:52:15
We're not funded. This is an unfunded mandate." So, there was a lot of struggle
1:52:21
getting past that 20-25 years ago.
1:52:25
And there are some individuals, including,
1:52:30
very famous scientists, who were particularly resistant to that.
1:52:36
And I
1:52:39
have very little respect for that because NSF gets LTER funding in the context
1:52:48
of Congress for the larger package.
1:52:52
Which is the people?
1:52:54
Yeah.
1:52:55
And having a system that is geographically-dispersed across many
1:53:01
congressional delegation districts and stuff like that, is a real advantage.
1:53:07
So, NSF is up there competing with NASA or this outfit or that outfit for this
1:53:14
space probe or landing on the moon or one thing another, and the NSF needs to have
1:53:20
some larger packages, and LTER comes up.
1:53:24
And so, we have a stake as a whole network to feed NSF story lines
1:53:33
so they can compete on our behalf.
1:53:35
So,
1:53:38
I think our
1:53:42
culture has come into sharpest focus for me in the context of
1:53:47
the All-Scientists Meetings.
1:53:49
And I don't know when the first one was,
1:53:53
maybe 25 years ago, but now they're done a three-year cycle.
1:54:00
And they are designed to cultivate network functionality, to cultivate
1:54:08
not a branching hierarchical system where some eminent leader comes in
1:54:13
and tells us what the vision, a Steve Jobs for Apple or something, comes in
1:54:19
and tells us "how it's gonna be," what our culture is going to be, and what
1:54:25
our themes are going to be, what our measures of success are going to be.
1:54:28
But rather, it is cultivating the highly dispersed social network because most
1:54:36
of the time we're there, we're working in small working groups of people from
1:54:40
many other sites, who share a passion for a particular research theme.
1:54:47
You're almost going counter to human nature, certainly capitalist culture,
1:54:55
western culture, the I, the me, in individualism, in that culture, and even
1:55:02
just the natural dynamics of, "My God, my career's got to survive, I need money, I
1:55:06
need tenure, I need this, I need that." So, there's a certain countercultural,
1:55:14
many countercultural aspects to that idea, although if you really take it to its
1:55:19
logical conclusion, if you really go into that shared paradigm idea, you're actually
1:55:29
mirroring what you're studying, ecology.
1:55:33
Yeah.
1:55:34
Maybe that sounds corny, but I'm making kind of a segue statement
1:55:38
here as we continue this discussion.
1:55:40
Oh, I agree completely.
1:55:42
For example, and I'm totally out on the fringe, I've been trying to get my buddy,
1:55:49
David Foster, Director of Harvard Forest and LTER PI there, since the get-go, to
1:55:57
write about a New England and Northwest comparison, and to talk about the exercise
1:56:03
of our science citizenship as a site program, and exercising our citizenship
1:56:09
at the scale of our home bioregions through mechanisms such as Harvard Forest
1:56:18
Group, which has led development of a conservation strategy for forests of New
1:56:24
England, started for just Massachusetts and now runs through Maine, called
1:56:29
"Wildlands and Woodlands." And it's a dominantly private ownership landscape.
1:56:33
Which is, that's the East.
1:56:35
Yeah, and working through conservation easements, but
1:56:38
in a broader design context.
1:56:40
In our case, we're working in a dominantly public land, federal public lands context.
1:56:47
And through the mechanism of the Forest Wars and the Northwest Forest
1:56:52
Plan, we have had an opportunity to distribute some of our science-rooted
1:56:59
concepts across, 10 million hectares.
1:57:05
And so,
1:57:13
this is where we come into this big
1:57:17
exercise of science citizenship and how our work plays very broadly.
1:57:23
So,
1:57:27
we should be able to model within our own group a full ecosystem that
1:57:32
includes the arts and humanities and social sciences, and all that as we
1:57:38
try to study the world we live in.
1:57:42
We might sort of emphasize our bioregion as our study site, in these
1:57:48
fully-coupled human natural system
1:57:53
word view.
1:57:54
So, it's almost 4:00, and I'm running out of steam, and I'd like to go ride my bike.
1:58:00
And so, I'd like to continue this when, we can close off for a little bit.
