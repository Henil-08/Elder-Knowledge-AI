00:00
Today’s date is February 16, 2020.
00:02
I am Madilyn Sturges.
00:04
This is an oral history interview with Julie Derrick in Corvallis,
00:08
Oregon, for the OSU History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:13
America Oral History Project.
00:15
Can you pronounce and spell your name?
00:18
My name’s Julie Derrick.
00:20
I’m looking at you, right?
00:22
Yeah.
00:22
It’s J-u-l-i-e D-e-r-r-i-c-k.
00:24
Thank you.
00:24
The first topic we’re going to talk about is your family and childhood.
00:30
When and where were you born?
00:33
Where did you grow up if it wasn’t the same place you were born?
00:38
Right.
00:39
I was born in Twin Falls, Idaho, which is in the southern part of the state
00:46
and then my dad worked on highway construction, so we moved around a lot and
00:52
then eventually he got into logging, so we settled up in the north central part
00:58
of the state in a town called Orofino.
01:02
I grew up there.
01:03
I went to college at the University of Idaho in Moscow.
01:08
Can you share a little bit about your family, what your parents
01:13
did for work, obviously logging and highway, and any siblings?
01:17
Yeah.
01:18
I had an older sister.
01:20
She’s eight years older than me.
01:23
I have a younger sister who’s four years younger.
01:26
We weren’t happy but I’m really thick with my mom and my
01:31
sisters and I are very close.
01:34
Dad was extremely abusive and alcoholic and struggled to keep
01:38
work and keep things flowing.
01:40
My mom did manage to separate and divorce when I was ten.
01:45
That was pretty cool.
01:47
She went to secretarial school and got a job working for the Forest Service.
01:53
My grandparents, her parents, were really, really big in my growing up and we would
01:59
go stay with them for extended stretches.
02:02
They always lived out in these super rugged Idaho places, like not in towns.
02:08
I think the rural world really saved me, you know.
02:12
We grew up kind of wildish, but Mom’s kind of proper, too.
02:18
Our clothes were always ironed and shit.
02:21
Our hair was just right to her, whatever.
02:24
That’s where I sprouted.
02:26
My older sister had made it out and she went to college and I remember her coming
02:33
home when I was in high school and she had like the Rocky Horror Picture Show
02:40
soundtrack and ska music and new wave and she taught me to dance and whip my hair
02:47
and just made me feel like, hell, yeah.
02:50
There’s something else.
02:51
I was able to jet out of that scene.
02:55
That’s really the [gestures dialing with clicking sound] version of it.
03:00
I didn’t identify myself as queer, although I definitely had queer
03:05
feelings and was just like no, I’m just going to use my brains and I
03:11
was going to be an intellectual.
03:13
I wasn’t going to marry some fucking logger and get beat up, you know?
03:19
Which was my extreme version of what my options were.
03:24
Then when I got to college I don’t know, I still didn’t
03:29
really think of myself as queer.
03:31
It was more like punk.
03:33
Just open minded.
03:35
Keeping it to myself, I guess.
03:37
I didn’t actually end up “coming out” and starting to really get into romantic
03:43
relationships with women until ’92.
03:45
Then just right away I got activated, because there was a lot to protest.
03:51
The OCA and the far right and then they were really vicious and really, really
03:58
active and they were pretty sure they were going to beat us down, you know?
04:04
I don’t know.
04:05
I had worked really hard to get to that point.
04:09
I wasn’t going to shut down.
04:12
That was where we all kind of came from [makes sprouting gesture] . Coming
04:17
here was cool because I got to meet all these kids from small town Oregon.
04:24
We were all here in Corvallis for various reasons and
04:28
something really sparked with us.
04:30
It was like, shit yeah.
04:32
We have each other now.
04:34
We’re not the only one of us in this little place.
04:39
That’s some of the origin.
04:41
What else?
04:42
I know you talked about how your sister pretty much gave you hope that
04:48
you were going to get out of there, but was there any activities that
04:54
you did growing up that you enjoyed?
04:57
Oh, yeah.
04:58
I was really, I got really good grades.
05:01
I was really into school.
05:03
They had a hard time finding stuff to keep me busy.
05:08
I ended up getting into yearbook and editing the yearbook and I had
05:13
my little cadre of girlfriends.
05:15
I would just always, whatever class, I hated the sciences.
05:20
I don’t like chemistry or math or biology.
05:23
I’ll just get, just find a way to do something else, like
05:28
become the teacher’s assistant.
05:30
It was so small town.
05:32
It was so silly, but they would just send me out doing like their
05:38
personal errands in their cars during school and I liked that.
05:43
I was really into finding a different way to exist than what
05:48
was set there in front of me.
05:51
Were you more outgoing or were you just like stick to the books, get out of there?
05:58
Same person I am now.
06:00
Slightly reserved, at times very animated.
06:02
We started partying and so we went out in the woods a lot.
06:08
I don’t know, just like a small cohort of friends where
06:13
you can really let loose with.
06:15
That’s kind of my preference.
06:17
I’m socially skilled, you know what I mean?
06:21
[Laughs]
06:21
You already talked about this a little bit, but when did you first come across
06:27
the queer community, the LGBTQ community?
06:30
Was it just in the news or was it from friends that were talking about things?
06:37
How did that—Because I know it took you a while before you
06:42
were like: okay, I’ll identify.
06:44
How did that as a teen, especially from a small town [I’m from a
06:50
small town and I get that vibe].
06:53
How did you go about that?
06:55
Well, when I was in high school I had a job at the bakery.
07:01
That was owned by the parents of one of my close childhood friends
07:07
and they just offered me this job.
07:10
It was so cool.
07:11
It was such a great job.
07:14
They hired this girl who was two years older than me, Andi Stacey
07:20
[phonetic] , to be the weekend line cook.
07:22
It was like they would bake all these breads and do the cakes and all the
07:29
donuts and all that and then there was this little diner with the counter and
07:36
the metal milkshake things and stuff.
07:38
She was from Valdez, Alaska, and she was butch.
07:42
She just never was like, I’m queer!
07:45
But she never was not.
07:47
You know what I mean?
07:49
We worked together for this stretch of time every Saturday and those
07:54
were just like my favorite days.
07:57
I just was like, again, like a beacon.
08:00
I was like, there’s something about this that’s really—I have a real affinity.
08:06
I didn’t really push anything, push it, you know?
08:09
I did get in touch with her later through social media and told her
08:15
that I had had this mad crush on her for years and it was cool.
08:22
She was like, oh that’s cool.
08:24
[Laughs] . Thanks.
08:25
Then when I got in college I had a lot of queer friends, but I’ve always been really
08:33
drawn to lots of different in people.
08:36
It’s really important, I feel, to be—and my town was so narrow.
08:41
I was like, anything that’s like, I was just drawn to what’s not this main thing.
08:48
I already know that main thing.
08:50
That’s been—I’ve been beat down by that main thing, or whatever.
08:55
I’m like, what else?
08:56
What else?
08:57
You get your hands in everything, take advantage of the fact that you didn’t
09:03
have any [cough interrupts audio]
09:05
. Yeah.
09:06
I started dating girls pretty quickly after I moved to Portland.
09:10
A couple, but I didn’t really “come out” officially, but I was like, you know.
09:17
It takes time.
09:19
Just different.
09:21
When did you, how did you tell your mom or how did you tell your sisters?
09:26
Because you said that you didn’t officially come out, so did you
09:30
tell them, oh this is my girlfriend?
09:32
How did they react?
09:34
Was there the small town push from them or were they a little
09:36
more accepting because it’s you?
09:38
Well, after we moved to Portland and I did officially decide this was something
09:44
that I had to pursue or die, you know, and I met this girl right away.
09:50
We started hanging out and then my mom had a visit over to Portland planned too,
09:55
and I was like, I was just so excited once I finally realized what was up.
10:01
I was just so happy.
10:03
I didn’t feel isolated anymore, you know?
10:06
I had people and we were kissing and stuff.
10:11
It was awesome [laughs] . I was just so excited and I took my mom out to lunch and
10:16
I was like, hey, this is what’s going on.
10:18
She freaked out and was like, oh my God!
10:21
What have I done?
10:22
How could I have done this?
10:24
Your birth defect and all this shit that was just like, how did
10:28
I cause you to be so misshapen?
10:30
At that time, I was like Jesus.
10:35
Mom?
10:37
I’m cool.
10:38
It’s all good.
10:40
This is great.
10:41
You’ll get used to it, you know?
10:43
She did.
10:44
She started to like watch Oprah whenever Oprah would have something
10:49
on there that was gay positive.
10:51
She started to pay more attention to how gay got referenced.
10:56
She
10:59
just started to educate herself.
11:01
Not that slowly.
11:02
She came on pretty fast because we’re close.
11:05
It’s like, that kind of shit is not going to be tearing me apart from my mom.
11:16
At some point we were, my sisters it was easy.
11:19
They’re kind of like, good.
11:21
Good to know.
11:23
We’re really happy about this.
11:24
It was no surprise.
11:28
Then my younger sister with her two little kids moved over to Portland out of a
11:35
really bad relationship from their dad.
11:38
We just moved in together and we all were living as a family and
11:42
taking care of each other and stuff.
11:45
There’s always been a lot going on.
11:46
It’s not just all about my identity, pursuing of that.
11:52
I’m trying to remember.
11:55
My mom was over at one point.
11:56
We used to have big gatherings a lot.
12:01
All these people and mom had helped cook dinner.
12:04
It was just all these queers and she was like, wow.
12:07
It was like a Thanksgiving or something.
12:10
She was like, why aren’t all these people with their families?
12:13
I was like, well, because
12:18
families didn’t want them anymore.
12:20
They kicked them out since they came out.
12:22
I’m like, isn’t that awful?
12:24
I’m like, what could I do that would make you like kick me away from you?
12:28
She was like, nothing!
12:31
She just at that moment just embraced her relationship as an elder parent
12:39
to all of my friends, you know?
12:44
It was obviously pretty powerful
12:49
to get there.
12:51
She has always been brave.
12:53
My mom’s brave.
12:53
She sat in the living room with me while I home birthed my son.
12:58
She’s got courage.
12:59
We have that in common.
13:05
That’s cool.
13:05
When she says, she still will pop out some homophobic shit sometimes but
13:10
then at the same time, she has fought for acceptance and equality within her
13:16
Lutheran church and she raises her voice.
13:19
She’s still lives in small town Idaho and she raises it up of like
13:24
gay people are not child molesters.
13:26
In fact, my kids were molested by a straight, white man,
13:34
you know?
13:34
Stuff like that.
13:37
Still up.
13:37
Sometimes she’ll get mad at me because I’m not with a girl or a guy consistently.
13:45
It’s like, what are you?
13:45
You know?
13:47
It’s just you don’t need to know.
13:49
Don’t worry about it.
13:52
She did meet Derrick.
13:53
She got to know Derrick pretty well while we were together.
13:57
Besides your close family, what about your grandparents or anyone in the community?
14:02
Did you ever go back to your hometown and you’re like we should fix stuff here?
14:06
There’s problems here?
14:11
No [laughs]
14:12
. We’ll have to assume [inaudible]
14:12
. No.
14:12
I mean I go back and visit.
14:13
There’s a shoe cobbler in my hometown.
14:16
This town of 2,000 people has had a shoe repair shop there for like 60 years.
14:23
I grew up with that.
14:24
I feel like it’s part of what made it feel like, oh well, shoe repairs
14:28
are a really normal thing to do.
14:30
People need that.
14:32
I didn’t know at the time how rare that is.
14:36
I still whenever I go back and I go and I hit up the folks.
14:41
I hit up the cobblers and go and hang out and talk about
14:43
shoes and stuff for a while.
14:49
There’s that.
14:50
Other than that, no, I’m not going back to those places.
14:52
My sister just moved back because our folks are getting older now.
14:58
We were just talking on the phone before I came over here, and she’s
15:00
just like I want you to come out here.
15:01
I’m like, mm-mm,
15:06
nope [shakes head side to side] . Not right now.
15:09
Now we’re going to go into college.
15:12
Where did you, you already mentioned it earlier, but where
15:15
did you go for your undergraduate?
15:17
What was your major?
15:18
Why did you choose that major?
15:19
Okay.
15:21
University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.
15:25
The campus is not dissimilar to this, although it’s smaller and more hill-y.
15:31
But it’s a really clean place.
15:34
It must have been built probably around the same time the buildings, a lot of them
15:37
look familiar to me from my time there.
15:43
What did I do at first?
15:45
I mean,
15:48
I got tracked into more like an engineering major by my high
15:51
school counselor which was just because you’re smart, you’re
15:55
brainy so you should go do that.
15:57
I just, it was awful.
16:01
I ended up choosing communications, because I kept up with the yearbook
16:04
work at the newspaper and I worked at the yearbook and at the radio
16:09
station while I was in school.
16:11
I stuck with the communications and history minor.
16:16
What years were those?
16:17
I graduated in ’89.
16:21
I stayed around Moscow a little bit longer.
16:22
I was really involved in our activism that we were doing was
16:28
around the wars, the U.S.-sponsored wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
16:36
We were doing lots of work around raising visibility around those issues
16:42
and anti-racism work because Idaho is the heart of the Aryan nations out
16:47
here and they were really active then.
16:51
Those were the things that I was up to then.
16:55
It wasn’t so much of my own, I mean, my own personal development
17:00
was happening and stuff.
17:01
I was married for a while and that didn’t last at all.
17:05
I was just mostly into dudes basically and just kept this other
17:10
stuff always just like, you know.
17:13
It took me forever even to get into shoe repair.
17:15
It just kept sticking with me like [makes repetitive chit sounds] , you know?
17:19
A lot of prompting from friends and stuff.
17:21
Finally, I was like, well I’d rather check that out.
17:23
It seems like what I’m supposed to do.
17:25
It was kind of like that, my very slow process.
17:29
Some people just pop out the closet right away.
17:35
It’s really cool.
17:36
It just wasn’t my
17:41
process.
17:42
You did talk about the activism that you were involved in.
17:45
When you came to Corvallis, when did you come to Corvallis?
17:50
I moved here in ’95, so let’s see.
17:51
There was the coming out in ’92.
17:55
Then I got involved with the Portland Lesbian
17:59
Avengers pretty much right away and we would, our meetings were in this,
18:03
it was like a bookstore collective that was in southeast Portland.
18:09
The OCA and the neo-Nazis would show up and stand outside the space while were
18:17
having our meetings taking pictures of us.
18:20
They’d all hover around while we were going in and out.
18:22
It was real scare tactics they were
18:28
enacting.
18:28
We were just like, oh I guess they’re really threatened by
18:31
a bunch of dykes hanging out.
18:33
There must be something to that.
18:37
That’s the spirit of the Avengers that I always was drawn to.
18:41
It was punk.
18:44
It was a little in your face but in like we’re going to also make you laugh.
18:49
We’re going to be really hot.
18:51
We’re going to be having a good time together.
18:55
That energy was really, I was ripe for it.
18:58
I think the times were ripe for it as well.
19:03
I met Derrick at an action.
19:08
He lived here but he was always coming up because his sister lived in
19:12
Portland and he started doing Avenger
19:15
stuff.
19:16
Everybody was after that guy.
19:20
He’s so hot.
19:24
Finally I was like, that one’s for me.
19:30
We hooked up.
19:32
He lived here.
19:34
We did a lot of back and forth-ing.
19:35
He actually got a job in north Idaho fighting fires and I had been up
19:40
in southeast Alaska on a fishing boat working and I came back from
19:45
that and with my dog I hitchhiked from Seattle over to north Idaho.
19:53
We were playing this mystery game.
19:55
No cell phones, of course, at that time.
19:57
I didn’t reside any particular place when I was in Alaska.
20:02
He didn’t reside any particular place in Idaho.
20:06
The Forest Service bunkhouse for a while and rooming with this one
20:11
person for a while, but I was like I’m not going to tell you when I’m
20:15
leaving but I’m going to find you.
20:17
He was like, I’m not going to tell you where I am.
20:20
Find me.
20:23
I did
20:28
[laughs] . That was cool.
20:30
We were just out as fuck.
20:32
This is north Idaho.
20:33
It’s very, very, it’s extreme there.
20:37
Idaho, if you’re ever curious look it up.
20:42
I can’t even exaggerate how fucked that place is.
20:47
Also, my home, you know?
20:52
Those trees and those rivers that I grew up in.
20:56
I’m like, so I’m there.
20:58
I’m like I’m from here.
21:00
I’m queer.
21:02
What’s the big—I’m like, this is my Idaho, too.
21:06
This is my home, too.
21:08
Derrick is like so into the woods and trees and forest.
21:15
That’s his spot.
21:17
We were like, but we’re not going to—we’re not cloaking.
21:21
I
21:24
don’t know.
21:24
I was just like, logger boots.
21:27
Vintage slips.
21:29
It was the ‘90s, you know?
21:32
Just roaming around this small town with my like logger socks.
21:37
You might as well play it up, I guess, if you’re just going to—we’re visible
21:41
anyway, so you might as well be like
21:45
really just own it.
21:50
We spent a summer up there.
21:52
It was kinda nuts, but we were safe, ultimately safe.
21:57
We left.
22:00
I remember we went over to Spokane to go dancing one night.
22:05
You had to find out about queer things.
22:07
You had to do research to find out.
22:11
It was word-of-mouth.
22:14
We got word of this place, this basement under a bar that was
22:17
like the queers would go there.
22:20
I was like, yeah, let’s go dancing.
22:23
We drove over to Spokane from Wallace, or wherever he was.
22:27
No, it was Kellogg, danced and then when we got out it was like all the
22:34
fucking drunk rednecks would line up outside the queer bar and be wasted
22:41
and just hanging out just to like fuck with people as we were leaving the bar.
22:46
Everybody.
22:48
Everybody has their own ways of skirting that.
22:51
It was just wild times, wild times.
22:57
Really forges your sense of—I mean, we brought all of that to the Avengers.
23:05
All of that life experience of just being out and being wild and being
23:13
demanding a certain, and taking chances.
23:18
All of that, but it was like, we couldn’t not.
23:22
We couldn’t not be that visible.
23:25
We were not going to hide it.
23:29
I don’t know if you all have ever been in love, deep, deep love,
23:34
but it makes you really strong.
23:39
Yeah.
23:40
You guys went around the northwest and then you ended up in Corvallis.
23:46
The Lesbian Avengers, this one, is based in Corvallis, right?
23:49
Yes.
23:50
I was affiliated up there but after that whole summer, that whole epic
23:56
thing we did, we were pretty much wanted to be together all the time.
24:00
I was coming down here a lot, but we were both like, no, long distance is cool.
24:06
We always had an open relationship.
24:10
I guess they call it “non-monogamy” at the time. I don’t know if it
24:13
still is, so we liked the space.
24:18
Eventually it was like no, we need to mmm.
24:21
In ’95, in the fall, I moved down here.
24:25
Before that, even, through his school, his education here, he got a job in
24:31
Honduras for a summer doing ecotourism stuff where he worked for this ecotourist
24:39
company that would take people out whitewater rafting and stuff in Honduras.
24:45
I went down there and spent a month with him and definitely we were way more
24:49
toned down, as far as not all the other shit I was telling you about Idaho.
24:55
That was me owning my own right to be who I want to be in my home.
25:03
Still, we were denied lodging because we were two females
25:07
traveling together like we were.
25:10
Derrick’s
25:12
always been like at that time was like what the fuck are you?
25:19
Is this a man?
25:20
Is this a woman?
25:21
Is this a man?
25:21
There wasn’t the language.
25:23
It was just really different times.
25:28
We traveled down there, too.
25:31
Yeah, you had to go far to find the queers in Tegucigalpa.
25:37
He of course found the queers.
25:41
Very much a magnet.
25:41
We have been through a bunch of stuff like that.
25:45
Then I moved here.
25:46
Then kind of straight away he was already friends with Boky and
25:50
Ana and Carla and Jodi and stuff.
25:57
Just something, it was like [makes collecting gesture]
26:01
. Something just needed to happen.
26:05
Which is pretty cool, because Corvallis, it seems, it’s
26:08
always felt kind of separated.
26:10
It’s like it’s its own place, especially like OSU, even finding people so
26:15
easily when you’re all together and you're roughly in the same age groups.
26:21
Yeah.
26:23
In this question,
26:28
we found these photos
26:31
of is this like the documented first time that you guys were all together?
26:37
Yes.
26:38
This was it.
26:41
This was our origin day.
26:43
How did it come together?
26:44
Was it just word-of-mouth that you like, oh we’re going to meet up.
26:48
We’re doing what Portland’s doing, what New York is doing?
26:51
Come to this house?
26:52
Yeah, Boky Vidic
26:55
in this picture had been talking with Derrick about all the hassles
27:03
she was getting for being queer in the athletics department.
27:06
She was playing basketball for OSU and was just getting a raft of shit
27:12
and they were talking about it.
27:13
We were like, well we should do something about that.
27:17
He and I already had Lesbian Avenger experience from Portland and I
27:23
can’t remember if Heidi had some Avenger experience or not, too.
27:29
Since it just was like the word got around.
27:34
I think that we flyered.
27:37
I think the reason this is on this page is that we flyered.
27:42
We just, our handpicked first group, like Bryan and Derrick were roommates then.
27:49
I lived in that house as well.
27:51
Jodi and Carla [phonetic] were together and always lived together.
27:55
Heidi was in the dorms.
27:57
Ana lived, that’s Ana, she lived out with her partner, Lisa, in a
28:05
school bus someplace out that way.
28:10
Diane lived somewhere in town.
28:15
Yeah,
28:17
we just were like—
28:18
It was hand-picked.
28:19
You were just like these people are active and they’re angry
28:23
and they want to do something.
28:24
No.
28:24
We were just, that’s who we were running around with.
28:26
These were our friends.
28:28
Yeah, we were like fired up and yeah.
28:33
We should do some stuff.
28:34
It’s also, like what else are you going to do?
28:36
You got to do stuff.
28:41
There was lots of opportunities.
28:43
It was like, that’s not fair.
28:45
It’s not right.
28:45
You shouldn’t be treating people like that in athletics.
28:50
That’s what that picture, was the instigation.
28:55
Can you describe, and you did some really good name-drop getting everyone involved,
29:00
can you describe the feeling besides just you talked about the basketball thing was
29:07
really getting everyone, but when everyone gathered together was it just like, yes.
29:14
We’re going to do this?
29:14
Was it like that?
29:16
Yeah, it was definitely.
29:17
We were excited.
29:18
I think we were trying to remember who it was but I feel like a couple of the
29:23
Portland Avengers did come down and talk about some of the actions they had done.
29:33
We had read Sarah Schulman and we kind of had a framework of
29:37
how the organization was going.
29:40
We were just going to apply it to our own.
29:42
We knew our situation was unique in it being so rural.
29:46
It’s
29:48
very small.
29:53
It starts small.
29:55
You were living in this house.
29:57
Did your house become kind of like a, oh the door’s open for any of you guys
30:01
if you need to come in and drop by?
30:03
Or was it just for the meetings that you would?
30:06
I just had that,
30:09
so when you were talking I was like oh, my God.
30:10
Yeah.
30:11
I think that’s what a lot of us found, was relating that sense of
30:15
having come out of whatever towns.
30:17
Not all of—I mean, Ana’s from New York.
30:20
Some of us are from really small towns.
30:24
Carla was from New Orleans.
30:27
But just that sense of whatever you’re going through you feel so isolated.
30:31
Having the hate group continue to get things up on the ballot, where people
30:38
were just literally like being invited to go vote about our basic human rights
30:43
was just like, you have to band together.
30:49
I just, isolation is deadly.
30:54
I mean, I had personally like a friend community that was devastated by HIV
31:00
and AIDS up in Seattle, where I was really tight with a bunch of people
31:06
who I had met in college in Idaho.
31:11
There was some really specific things to like what I felt was my own personal
31:16
communities in addition to always having an awareness of like, I’m not the only.
31:23
It’s not that self-centered.
31:26
There was always other stuff of course.
31:29
The term now is “intersectionality,” right?
31:33
That’s what I always have felt was just the right way to exist.
31:38
It was fun to be like, wow, we’re going to prioritize this.
31:45
The humor of the Lesbian Avengers was really captivating to me.
31:50
It was very clever.
31:53
We thought we were very clever.
31:58
You were an elementary teacher during your years, so when you came
32:01
to Corvallis, you got a job at one of the elementary schools here?
32:05
No, I got a job at the Corvallis Montessori School.
32:08
I’m
32:12
trying to think what led to that?
32:14
What was I doing in Portland?
32:18
I had gone to Portland State to get a master’s degree in English.
32:24
I wanted to be a lit teacher.
32:26
I taught freshman writing classes there, and that’s when I first got really
32:30
active, because that was literally during “No on 9,” which was like no public
32:35
institution would be allowed to sanction any form of open homosexuality, right?
32:40
They wanted that to be statewide.
32:43
I mean I had a job there.
32:45
I was a
32:48
TA for the English department and it just was really personal.
32:54
Plus, I had my first girlfriend.
32:56
I met this whole group of people.
32:58
My Portland friends were like theater.
33:03
They formed an independent radical theater company.
33:08
That was their main thing.
33:10
They weren’t necessarily—there was some overlap with the Avengers, but
33:17
I didn’t come to be an identity Lesbian Avengers until I moved down here.
33:24
Does that answer your question?
33:25
I just was curious what the overlap of “No on 9” and all of that and like the
33:31
fact that Lesbian Avengers, one of their biggest things was the rainbow curriculum,
33:35
as I said before, and just like being an elementary school theater and you’re like
33:39
I’m here. You don’t want me to be here.
33:42
All of that.
33:42
You know, I just really needed a job and somehow I heard about the Corvallis
33:47
Montessori school and I had never worked in an elementary school before, but I
33:55
had been working as a teaching assistant.
34:00
I can do, I can get a job no matter what, but I was like I want a square job.
34:06
I wanted a regular job that’s going to have predictable hours, I don’t
34:09
want to work restaurant anymore, especially not in a college town.
34:14
Yeah, I just went there and I used my own relationship with my family as
34:21
having helped my sister raise her kids for the previous few years combined with
34:27
other educational background and stuff.
34:31
It seemed like a good fit.
34:32
I was in
34:36
a liberal, basically liberal tiny private school.
34:39
They were always completely supportive.
34:43
That’s an iconic picture of me and Derrick that was on the front
34:47
page of the newspaper with us eating fire with our arms linked.
34:51
The school director put that up in the school on the bulletin board.
34:55
He’s like, we’re so proud of you.
34:57
He got a little push back from parents but it didn’t touch me at all.
35:01
I didn’t hear about it until a year later.
35:03
He just fielded it.
35:04
It was great.
35:06
His daughter came out and joined the Avengers, too.
35:10
I remember when she came out he pulled me aside and was like,
35:12
um... no, it wasn’t even that.
35:13
it was I had cut myself making a theater piece for the kids or something and
35:19
he was dragging me to the ER and he was like, “my daughter, [inaudible]
35:24
, just came out. Do you have any thoughts.” I was like, just love her.
35:28
Tell her you love her all the time.
35:31
It’s all good.
35:33
You’re lucky that she decided to talk to you.
35:36
Yeah.
35:36
You’re like, look after her.
35:37
I know [laughs]
35:40
. I felt completely supported there.
35:43
I mean, the kids were great.
35:48
That was a really good work experience.
35:50
I liked that.
35:52
Yeah, we were going to ask more of like how did you manage the interaction
35:56
between your activism and your professionalism, but it seems like
35:59
you had a really good support system?
36:00
Mm-hmm [yes]
36:01
. That’s really cool.
36:03
I used to have this sticker on my bike that said, I fuck to cum not to conceive.
36:09
They made me take that off.
36:11
They made me cover that up while I had my bike parked on the school grounds.
36:16
That was the only thing that Bruce ever told me was not appropriate.
36:21
That’s the picture.
36:25
Now we’re going to talk more directly about the Lesbian Avengers.
36:28
The first question is: what has being a Lesbian Avenger taught you?
36:32
Be as broad, be as specific as you want.
36:35
What has it taught me?
36:36
Yeah.
36:38
From when you first joined to now that you like reflect back and
36:41
you’re like, oh that specific moment.
36:43
That was something.
36:45
I
36:52
mean, I think when you’re motivated by love and you have the opportunity
36:57
to be really solid with people, you should take that opportunity.
37:04
because you don’t know.
37:06
They say like tomorrow’s promised to no one.
37:09
You never fucking know.
37:10
You should just do the most you can, the most good you can and I already
37:16
knew that as a basic value that the Lesbian Avengers really were like, yeah.
37:23
This is exactly true.
37:24
We should always do the most you possibly can with the energy and
37:29
resources you’re given and make more.
37:32
Just make places better.
37:34
Make things better.
37:36
The Lesbian Avengers, I feel like that’s what we did.
37:41
We were sexy.
37:42
We had fun.
37:47
I was, at the time of life when I had a lot of energy for that.
37:52
We all did.
37:56
I guess just to recognize magic when you’re in its presence,
38:02
go for it.
38:03
Don’t be afraid.
38:05
That’s probably what the Lesbian Avengers.
38:07
I mean, eating fire!
38:08
C’mon.
38:08
Have you ever done it?
38:09
No.
38:11
You got to face it.
38:15
That was critical.
38:17
Yeah.
38:17
That was actually one of the questions—can you talk about swallowing fire?
38:21
We have basic knowledge of the swallowing fire based on what happened, but when
38:29
you did it, can you describe the feeling?
38:32
The power you felt?
38:34
Well, I can teach you how to do it.
38:36
[Laughs]
38:36
. You know.
38:36
Okay, off camera [laughs] . Can
38:38
you
38:44
describe it?
38:47
More the feeling.
38:52
When you were doing it, was it, like you felt you were
38:55
physically taking back the power.
38:58
I’m never been crazy about the chant.
39:01
You know—“We take the fire within us.
39:03
We take it and make it.
39:04
The fire will not consume us.” I’m not big on the chant, but the
39:10
spirit of that makes sense to me.
39:13
I
39:15
was never the biggest lover of fire eating.
39:20
Some people would make these giant ass torches and just be able to like dig it.
39:26
It wasn’t competitive, but it was like it makes you feel big
39:31
because you’re doing something
39:34
that has a purpose expressed within the organization.
39:36
I know
39:39
at this very moment there could be Avengers eating fire, too, in like
39:43
Massachusetts or Texas or someplace and that’s cool, that you’re part
39:49
of a bigger organism that all uses this one thing to express this one
39:55
feeling of just don’t be afraid.
39:59
You have to do things.
40:01
You can teach yourself as much as possible and you’re taking a risk at the same time.
40:10
But don’t be afraid of it.
40:12
That’s what it feels like when you’re like, I’m afraid.
40:15
I’m afraid.
40:15
What if I burn myself?
40:17
What if I fuck up?
40:19
What if I put it out too early?
40:20
Don’t be afraid.
40:22
You’re going to fuck up.
40:26
You’re going to.
40:28
Sometimes you’re going to fuck up but don’t’ be afraid.
40:32
That’s the feeling of like, and then when you go through that you
40:34
and get yourself all through it and you’ve done it, you’re like: yeah.
40:38
Cool.
40:39
And you did it.
40:40
And you did this too.
40:41
And you did this too.
40:47
It was a brilliant device to unify the Lesbian Avengers across the board.
40:54
It’s brilliant.
40:55
It said everything.
40:56
Then
41:04
we’ll go back to—any moments that you are particularly
41:07
proud of that the Avengers did.
41:09
This can be whether that you actually interacted with or just broadly.
41:13
Like, you felt the fire thing was
41:17
amazing that they connected.
41:17
That’s one.
41:17
That was brilliant.
41:20
I think maybe the action that we did here that I feel, one that stands out
41:26
that I feel super good about having done was when Roxanne and Michelle
41:32
were murdered and the guy just claimed it as a hate crime down in Medford.
41:43
I never even met them but I felt like I lost my aunties.
41:47
It felt really close.
41:50
Really close.
41:53
Here I am with this like boy-girl person and we’re like intertwined.
41:59
We all go everywhere together.
42:01
We’re all obviously queer and it’s like, yeah, there could be somebody
42:05
out there that wants to pick you off, that would really like the
42:07
opportunity to fuck up a queer.
42:12
Where I am now, I’m like I know my neighborhood.
42:16
I’m all like, I’m all good.
42:17
Even when I go out in the forest, I don’t fear that I’m going to get gay bashed.
42:22
I don’t fear that right now in my life.
42:25
It
42:28
felt really different to me then just as awareness that like, wow.
42:32
That was fucked up.
42:34
We were all really touched by that.
42:37
So, for me, I love that action so much.
42:40
The day-long vigil that we did on the MU quad.
42:46
We taught so many people to eat fire.
42:48
We ate so much fire that day.
42:51
We taught so many people to do it, but we would make them interact with us.
42:54
It’s not like, woo!
42:56
We’re going to show anybody.
42:59
Just come one, come all.
43:00
It's not a fucking science show.
43:02
It’s a vigil.
43:04
If you want to, you’re curious.
43:07
Come on.
43:08
We’ll talk to you.
43:10
We won’t bite unless you’re mean.
43:14
That was really potent because it was important.
43:17
Hate crimes were so on the rise during that time.
43:20
The OCA was just giving people the latitude to do all kinds of
43:25
nasty shit, not just to queers.
43:29
Hate crimes across the board.
43:31
I don’t even know where we got the research on this.
43:33
I was more like fresh out of academia at the time.
43:39
A lot of people in the group were students.
43:41
Heidi she went on to be a lawyer.
43:43
That girl could research.
43:45
She could find information.
43:46
It was probably Heidi that pulled that together.
43:48
We did this really lovely in remembrance.
43:52
It was powerful.
43:54
It lasted super long.
43:56
I felt like we really reached people in a different way than sometimes we did.
44:01
It was a little more somber.
44:03
It was just different style.
44:06
I like that we always kept variety in our actions.
44:12
We didn’t get into one set thing—"Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Homophobia has got to
44:19
go!” I would have participated in a lot of those actions to be sure.
44:25
That just wasn’t our style of what we were going to do.
44:28
It’s going to a lot more unruly,
44:32
sort of.
44:34
That’s what stands out.
44:36
You felt like you could reach people more because you did it
44:40
for so—you did the full day thing?
44:42
Well, it was kind of a turn, I think, in my opinion for some of the people,
44:45
some of the older, more conservative, still out lesbians who were in town.
44:51
They weren’t quite sure, maybe felt a little alienated or a little bit
44:56
protective of what they had fought so hard to create and were just
44:59
kind of like let’s keep it smooth.
45:01
We were like, yeah but it’s not smooth.
45:02
Already it’s not smooth.
45:05
Let’s just quit lying about it, but also trying to be compassionate toward
45:09
like... but I think on that day some of the older women came through and were
45:15
like, this is really beautiful, you guys.
45:18
There was a heart, it felt more of an action for our own queer
45:23
community but in public, too.
45:26
We taught people to eat fire who were like, this is really special.
45:31
Barb did that!
45:32
She did it!
45:33
Prudence did
45:37
it!
45:37
The difference between like the louder activists versus the people
45:41
that are like in the side, oh I’ve created this bubble for me.
45:46
Getting those people to come out and stand alongside?
45:48
Mm-hmm.
45:50
Yeah.
45:53
Our own community can be some of the hardest people to win as allies.
46:01
You can get into a lot of internal debate about tactics and approaches and ahhh!
46:06
Why a bomb?
46:08
You know, kind of thing.
46:11
But we eventually I felt like really, I mean, I won’t try to overstate,
46:18
but I feel like we actually brought the community together in new ways
46:22
that hadn’t been present before.
46:24
Derrick is a genius.
46:25
He really is.
46:27
He was here on campus for five years and he pretty much built the organization
46:34
that was, I don’t know what you would call it now, but it was the LGBA.
46:37
Then
46:39
it was the LGBTA.
46:40
In the student resources consistently intersecting different kinds of
46:45
oppression and uniting people because it’s not like you’re black or queer.
46:50
There’s a lot of queer black people.
46:52
You know what I mean?
46:53
There’s a lot of overlap and like we made, well the other favorite action I was
46:59
thinking about when I was walking around today was a combined action with MEChA,
47:07
who we got connected with I think because Derrick had gotten to be
47:10
friends with these three brothers.
47:13
We called them los boys, but they were from Peru and had moved up here at some
47:19
point and we all just got really tight.
47:22
They would always have these parties where people were dancing and they’d invite us.
47:29
It was so fun to just be in, excuse me, community with people and they wouldn’t.
47:38
Our dance parties were like, topless.
47:42
That was our private space to be like really comfortable.
47:46
There wasn’t—but we did food together.
47:49
Anyways, we decided to do an action around Mom’s Weekend.
47:53
It was visibility around
47:58
brown people on campus and queer people on campus.
48:02
Because the event just felt so narrowly focused on this
48:08
one picture of who is here.
48:13
It didn’t feel realistic.
48:15
We, I don’t remember whose house it was, but we mixed up a big pot
48:19
of wheat paste on the stove and followed a recipe or whatever.
48:24
Because whatever, it was probably Heidi, had an anarchist cookbook or something.
48:33
We went around in the middle of the night and we pasted these flyers that we
48:36
had made for both of us and we put them both together at every spot all over.
48:43
It was like, hehe.
48:45
We’re out in the middle of the night.
48:46
This is so cool.
48:47
We’re doing this.
48:48
We’re wheat pasting.
48:49
We’re all together.
48:51
The Latino guys and the queers and we’re like allies doing this thing
48:58
that we decided to do together.
49:00
That was actually really fun.
49:01
It was cool.
49:02
Then you go around until they all get torn down but you can walk by the places
49:06
where you know they are and put one in a little secret place so you can see it.
49:14
That was a good action in my mind.
49:15
Is
49:18
there any, did you feel unsafe as a Lesbian Avenger while in Corvallis
49:24
and on campus since you were part of so many public events that were
49:27
obviously being photographed for all
49:29
the newspapers, both Corvallis and OSU?
49:32
Were there any times where you were like, oh this is not.
49:35
I don’t want to be a part of this part?
49:37
Or did you just feel unsafe?
49:40
How did you counteract, like did you guys group together and make something
49:44
where everyone was safe during possible times where other people
49:48
were coming on to protest against you?
49:52
I mean once in a while there would be some people that would
49:55
mess with you a little bit.
49:58
People here, I mean I don’t know why.
50:00
I don’t know what level of privilege that came into for me
50:07
personally, but I didn’t ever feel.
50:10
Maybe it was my age, being a little bit older than most of the guys.
50:15
Growing up, we’re like frat boys ain’t got shit.
50:19
I’m like, fuck
50:24
you guys.
50:24
I never felt personally like—and also I didn’t go.
50:26
I won’t go certain places.
50:27
I’m not going to get drunk and go walk home at 2:00 in the morning,
50:31
which is never a reason for a person to get assaulted in any way.
50:36
You should be able to do that if you want to.
50:39
I just, I’m like, certain little terrains I’m not going to cross.
50:46
Actually when I did come here, when I first got here, I had a job housekeeping.
50:51
Or maybe it was during one of the summers when the school was closed down
50:54
and you had to pick up other things.
50:58
Housekeeping for the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority, which was my sorority in
51:03
college at U of I. It was so funny, because I would be in there scrubbing
51:07
their fucking barf out of the toilets.
51:10
I’d be like, I’m an AGD, too.
51:14
It was hilarious.
51:15
You could end up like me [laughs] . But I was happy.
51:21
Safety-wise, we mostly stuck together.
51:26
I would get really, really nervous about Derrick.
51:30
I was really, really protective, because he was so singular and so
51:37
out but so, and he would walk and go around places and stuff a lot alone.
51:44
I would be like, okay.
51:46
It’s 2:00 a.m. that’s cool.
51:48
Yeah.
51:48
I know you got a death threat on the phone answering machine.
51:52
That shit’s weird.
51:56
There were times when I feared for his safety more than my own.
52:02
He would go, like we hitchhiked a lot because we didn’t have a car but we
52:06
still had a lot of friends in Portland.
52:10
He’d go into some restroom, like a public restroom, and he
52:13
would just be in there forever.
52:16
I’m standing outside and I’m smoking a cigarette, smoked a cigarette,
52:19
smoked a cigarette and like somebody’s fucking killing him in there.
52:22
I just know it.
52:23
Because he would use the men’s room.
52:26
That’s where he belonged more than the ladies room.
52:29
He would come out and he’d be like, nah I was just taking up some
52:32
extra space grooming my eyebrows or whatever just to take up the space.
52:39
I mean, if cellphones now you would just text.
52:44
There were definitely times when I was like, oh shit.
52:50
We did the self-defense workshop.
52:54
We did stuff like that to make ourselves feel stronger and get some actual, what
53:04
would you call it?
53:05
Actually skills or whatever, where you would try and practice it
53:12
and think on your feet like that.
53:15
Were there, so when someone was like I want to go here, you would like group
53:20
up and be like okay you two go together?
53:22
Or was it just when there was certain moments where it’s like, oh this
53:26
ballot is happening so we should be a little more on edge when we go places?
53:30
Oh, no.
53:31
I don’t remember it being that formalized.
53:33
Okay.
53:34
I remember it being more informal.
53:38
You were just like, Derrick, I swear to God.
53:41
Tell me where you’re going!
53:42
We went to China D [elight] when we first got into town today, because that’s
53:47
where we always used to go get lunch.
53:49
We had lunch there.
53:50
He did the same thing.
53:50
He went in the bathroom and was in there for like ever.
53:53
I’m just reading the newspaper.
53:55
At this point I’m not worried.
53:57
But, yeah, he’s still very long, lots of grooming
54:03
[laughs]
54:15
. The next question I have is while you were here did you see Oregon State University
54:20
trying to shift its views on any LGBT things based on what you guys were doing?
54:24
I feel like we made some difference within athletics.
54:28
I feel like Derrick would probably speak more specifically to that.
54:33
We definitely made a lot of ties and, again, I would say more like
54:38
the people who were on campus
54:42
made ties with people like the Black Student Union, like what we were doing
54:46
with MEChA, sort of raising each other’s awareness of each other and forming more.
54:52
I think we generated solidarity.
54:57
I don’t know.
54:58
We stirred up a lot of shit and brought things up and so I guess eventually
55:03
something must have settled because you guys have like resources now.
55:09
You have more dedicated resources specifically in the fact that
55:13
there’s this course that you guys are all taking and stuff like that.
55:19
I believe that our time was part of that.
55:21
Yeah
55:24
and the fact that we have a Pride Center now.
55:26
So, yeah.
55:27
I feel like that wouldn’t have existed during that time, but
55:29
it was definitely—there’s a lot of history that’s based in that.
55:34
I think that all of our visibility stuff really did bring up.
55:38
And then there’s people inside the institution following up on
55:43
those things that get brought up and keep pushing them through.
55:50
As far as specific changings in the administration and policy, I
55:54
guess I just look at what you have now and what wasn’t here then.
55:58
I feel like we were part of that getting better.
56:08
How do you think the Lesbian Avengers played its part with the third
56:11
wave feminist movement of the ‘90s?
56:14
Well,
56:17
I
56:20
mean we were extremely sex positive and
56:25
education positive around different kinds of sex in
56:29
relationships and bringing that up.
56:35
That feels really good to me that we did, that was just like our thing.
56:43
Chicks like the fuck.
56:45
You know what I mean?
56:47
There’s a certain sense of agency that I think was in that time.
56:53
I can only speak to my own experience, really.
56:59
I don’t know, I mean we read a lot and I don’t know exactly
57:04
how to answer that [laughs]
57:06
. It’s alright.
57:09
Have you seen—
57:10
We advanced the cause.
57:11
I’ll say that.
57:12
We advanced the cause.
57:13
Well, you were doing really cool with the intersectionality of being
57:16
like there are queer people of color.
57:20
There’s different forms of all this that interconnect and it’s
57:23
not just one side of your identity.
57:26
You were doing pretty well.
57:27
The youth group was not a specific Lesbian Avenger action, but I don’t even know.
57:34
Somebody was doing a queer out and about and they met at the
57:37
Methodist Church over here and somebody couldn’t keep facilitating.
57:41
They asked Derrick and I if we would take over facilitation.
57:44
We were like, cool.
57:46
That’s great.
57:47
Yes, let’s do it.
57:52
That was solid.
57:54
That was strong as far as like young people.
57:57
We did end up doing some actions with young people.
58:01
There were like highschoolers who were in the Avengers.
58:10
Derrick just had a message from somebody who was part of that youth group who
58:14
actually wrote him a thing that was like, this is what you meant to me at
58:21
that time when I was just this shy, 16-year-old from Scio or something,
58:29
to where it’s come now.
58:31
You make a difference.
58:33
But you don’t always know it.
58:38
have you seen activism that is similar to the activism the Lesbian
58:42
Avengers did in more recent years?
58:46
I think there’s been a lot of really, really, really, really good
58:49
and important direct-action style activism around climate justice.
58:55
That stands out to me specifically.
58:57
Do you have an examples that—?
59:01
Yeah.
59:02
I like the British,
59:12
the name of the group is escaping [me] —Extinction Rebellion.
59:17
Those guys.
59:18
It’s like theatrical where they’ll like stop traffic with the use of
59:23
big signage and puppets and also coordinated through social media.
59:29
You can do more small actions in a place.
59:34
That’s really interesting to me.
59:42
That’s what just comes to mind.
59:45
You’ve actually talked about this a couple times throughout this—what do you
59:48
think made the Lesbian Avengers stand out compared to other activist groups in the
59:52
‘90s and how about the Oregon chapter?
59:55
Or the Corvallis/Portland chapters?
59:58
What stood out that you’re like oh, I think this is what
1:00:01
made us so unique to this time?
1:00:07
We’re probably not that different from a lot of Avenger chapters because
1:00:15
of the spontaneity and the brazenness.
1:00:21
We were being, I think one thing that has always made us feel a
1:00:26
little different or has emphasized our uniqueness, or whatever, is
1:00:30
that we’re doing it in a small town.
1:00:34
You’re not doing this in New York City or Boston or like even in Portland
1:00:39
where the actions would be bigger.
1:00:41
The meetings were bigger.
1:00:43
There was just more anonymity and also more people.
1:00:48
We were like very, very visible and very known.
1:00:55
As a small town organization, who still exhibits all the same
1:01:04
actions, you know what I mean?
1:01:06
The same methods?
1:01:08
Same approach.
1:01:09
We’re all doing the shit the same way.
1:01:13
I think we got into trans stuff in a way that I didn’t see happening.
1:01:17
I definitely did not see it happening in Portland and I think it was
1:01:21
less happening across the board.
1:01:23
We were really focused and that’s one of the things that we did get
1:01:28
changed, was to get Benton County to create inclusive language around
1:01:36
protection for trans people, too.
1:01:43
That was always a big, I mean we were like a Lesbian Avenger issue is, we have
1:01:49
a pretty inclusive definition of what I would call a Lesbian Avenger issue.
1:01:57
I think we were unique in that.
1:02:00
What about the Lesbian Avengers overall compared to other
1:02:04
activist groups of that time?
1:02:06
During that time?
1:02:10
Was it just the exaggeration and the playfulness that maybe made
1:02:14
it more accessible for people to look at and interact with?
1:02:19
To me, the first thing that stands out is the sex.
1:02:22
We were really, very pro-sex and it was out there.
1:02:30
Part of our claiming of who we were was to be really frank about
1:02:34
it and enjoy that and stuff.
1:02:37
I was also in the Labor Movement during that time doing union organizing
1:02:43
and getting trained into that.
1:02:45
I love labor actions with big puppets and all the people in
1:02:53
the same identifying outfits.
1:02:56
I
1:02:59
love solidarity.
1:03:02
All old-school union action or picket line, I still find that really stirring.
1:03:09
That’s just old school.
1:03:15
I know I was paying attention to that.
1:03:17
The WTO.
1:03:17
I went to the WTO
1:03:21
in the ‘90s.
1:03:22
I’ve always been a Lesbian Avenger.
1:03:24
I still feel like I am.
1:03:26
But it wasn’t like an “Avenger Action.” It was this other event that I’m being myself
1:03:33
went to as myself, but as part of this.
1:03:40
I mean, that was a level of activism that I had never seen before being around
1:03:45
that many people and walking down Seattle streets were the things were like smoking.
1:03:51
Windows were smashed.
1:03:52
I had never been in something like that on that scale.
1:04:00
That stands out as a ‘90s experience of activism.
1:04:05
I went to stuff out like Save the Bull Run Watershed, which is where
1:04:09
Portland gets its water and smaller actions, like migrant worker actions
1:04:16
at the garden burger place where they were making them out by Woodburn.
1:04:20
I don’t know that they do that, they manufacture them anymore.
1:04:23
Anyways, have friends that were really involved with PCUN.
1:04:29
We would go to a lot of actions and I like all, I like so many
1:04:34
different kinds of actions.
1:04:37
There’s so many.
1:04:39
We staged the, I was hired by the SCIO union.
1:04:46
There was some anti-union ballot measures that were coming up.
1:04:51
They hired me to do a paid signature gatherer thing to go get.
1:04:56
I managed a little team of signature gatherers and they
1:05:02
would tell me where to go.
1:05:04
One of the places where we spent a lot of time was out in
1:05:07
front of the Walmart in Lebanon.
1:05:09
There
1:05:11
was also this old dude sitting there every day, this OCA
1:05:15
dude, hating on gay marriage.
1:05:18
That was their issue that they were trying to get on the ballot at the time was to
1:05:21
make it so gays could never, a threat to the institution of marriage, or whatever.
1:05:27
The overlap, then, I was like hm, I’m out here every day doing this union thing.
1:05:31
Let’s also do an Avenger action.
1:05:34
We did the clown wedding.
1:05:37
That’s all in the content, where it wasn’t like a gay wedding but
1:05:41
a clown wedding and we’re all gay.
1:05:44
We did it right in front of him so nobody could get to him and stuff.
1:05:49
That was fun.
1:05:50
They were doing their form of activism in the ‘90s.
1:05:55
Those fuckers.
1:05:56
They
1:06:01
were so thorough [laughs] . They would be everywhere.
1:06:07
The small town part of that feels really important to me as far as
1:06:15
our flavor of Avenger actions, the flavor of our chapter I should say.
1:06:18
Are you still active in any movements, the Lesbian Avengers, or anything like that?
1:06:24
Any union things that you are involved in?
1:06:26
I know they have marches up in Portland often.
1:06:29
Yeah, no I haven’t been to an action, like a march, in years.
1:06:33
It’s been a while.
1:06:35
Now I like, I volunteered at KBOO Community Radio for a while organizing
1:06:44
an association of cobblers, because my trade means so much and I think
1:06:50
it’s really viable but we should be banded together about it and like out.
1:06:57
I think I might be the only queer female cobbler shop owner around.
1:07:02
I’d like to meet the rest.
1:07:04
Just being out and
1:07:10
just doing, now I’m more in the like doing the equity work, continually
1:07:18
just doing the equity work around privilege and whiteness
1:07:21
and raising a teenager.
1:07:23
My son is 16 and he’s black.
1:07:28
And he’s dating and thinking about college.
1:07:33
I think
1:07:37
that’s where it is right now.
1:07:40
You’ve also mentioned a couple times about, but what do you do now?
1:07:43
Could you talk about your job and how it feels to be the only
1:07:47
queer female cobbler in Portland?
1:07:50
Is this in Portland?
1:07:50
Or closer?
1:07:54
I mean, there’s only two female shoe repair show, female-owned
1:08:00
shoe repair shops in Portland.
1:08:02
I know for sure Chris is not queer.
1:08:05
There’s that.
1:08:08
How long have you been doing this?
1:08:09
Fifteen years now.
1:08:11
Yeah.
1:08:11
I had to leave the Labor Union Organization.
1:08:13
It was just too abusive of an organization as far as how they’d
1:08:17
break down people’s spirits.
1:08:19
I had to leave them.
1:08:20
Then I got into another kind of community organizing through a non-profit
1:08:24
where I was working in the schools to help develop parent leadership
1:08:28
and stuff like that for bettering the quality of their kids’ education.
1:08:34
My son when he was one and Derrick was with us in the car,
1:08:37
too, we got into a car wreck.
1:08:40
We got rear-ended by a commercial dump truck and it totaled my car.
1:08:44
We were in Salem.
1:08:46
I had to stop working for a few months while I healed up from that.
1:08:50
During that time I was like, okay, my son’s two.
1:08:55
I pay somebody to spend so much time with him that I don’t get to spend.
1:09:03
It just was a real call to awareness about life.
1:09:07
My friends who’d been like hey you’ve been talking about shoes for fucking ever!
1:09:10
Are you going to do it or not?
1:09:13
I was like, yeah, I should do it.
1:09:15
People chipped in and took care of Arthur and made it really possible
1:09:19
for me to start doing that work.
1:09:28
That’s what I do.
1:09:29
Running a business is just a whole other thing.
1:09:35
Also, becoming a base in the community.
1:09:38
I do my equity work.
1:09:40
Everybody has shoes, but my shop is the spot.
1:09:45
It's the spot in Portland if you’re queer, JD does your shoes.
1:09:50
You know what I mean?
1:09:51
This is where you go because it’s just for one, it’s our community.
1:09:57
We need to just keep it in the community or whatever.
1:10:01
Then that’s not the only community where that’s the case.
1:10:04
I work really hard on that to be a leader in my community and to be recognized
1:10:10
as a person who’s like, it’s chill.
1:10:13
We got this.
1:10:14
If we have problems we’re going to work it out.
1:10:17
It’s good.
1:10:18
Come on.
1:10:19
You’re welcome here.
1:10:21
The dog doesn’t bite.
1:10:22
All that stuff.
1:10:23
It's really a big deal
1:10:28
[laughs]
1:10:29
. This is one of the last questions.
1:10:32
Can you talk more about your son and how have you taught him to
1:10:38
be involved in social justice?
1:10:42
How have you taught him about the Lesbian Avengers and your own history
1:10:45
of activism and have you gone, is he interested in any of that?
1:10:51
I mean, he’s always been a solid ally.
1:10:56
He’s always been if the little trans kid, the kids all the way along through
1:11:04
his schooling, he’s always been a really solid ally for gay kids and trans kids
1:11:10
and he’s got deep emotional intelligence.
1:11:13
Derrick
1:11:16
is his father figure, basically.
1:11:22
He’s just been raised.
1:11:23
Derrick teaches in the schools.
1:11:25
He teaches healthy relationships, they call it.
1:11:27
It used to be more like sex ed.
1:11:31
Arthur’s just been educated about really practical stuff and emo stuff
1:11:36
just from the get—and we’ve lived,
1:11:41
our home group is really varied.
1:11:45
Arthur’s been raised in queer and native people and forest defenders and cop
1:11:55
watchers and just a whole mix of people.
1:12:02
I feel like he’s got a pretty good template for whatever he wants to do.
1:12:06
He's definitely not out there in the street with signs or any of that shit.
1:12:10
He’s very private.
1:12:13
Not like that.
1:12:16
We’ll see.
1:12:16
You never know what’s going to happen.
1:12:19
Something can happen to activate you and you’re like okay.
1:12:23
This feels familiar.
1:12:25
Get to college.
1:12:26
Mm-hmm.
1:12:27
Yeah.
1:12:28
The last question I have is actually I wanted you to read your bio that you wrote
1:12:33
in this and tell me if you still identify with it and just what are your thoughts?
1:12:39
Oh, that’s fun.
1:12:40
I thought it’d be cool, because I enjoyed it so I wanted you to look at it.
1:12:44
I’m not sure that I wrote this myself.
1:12:46
I’m not sure who wrote all the—
1:12:47
Could you read it out loud and then—
1:12:49
[Laughs] Well, okay.
1:12:51
Yeah we just named ourselves by a first name, which is just—we didn’t
1:12:57
expect anybody else to read it but us.
1:13:00
So, we’re like, hehe, we’re hilarious.
1:13:06
[Starts reading] Julie, by day even-tempered elementary school
1:13:11
teacher, the bleach-blonde in old dresses and big boots.
1:13:16
By night, super gorgeous, trampy pornographer with a hot thing for tight
1:13:21
dresses, high heels and mean butch boys.
1:13:24
[interviewer whistles] . Yeah
1:13:27
[clicks tongue in response] . I can’t wear high heels anymore,
1:13:29
but I always have fabulous shoes.
1:13:32
It’s really important to me.
1:13:33
I still love tight clothes.
1:13:35
I got all the color and bleach out of my hair finally and
1:13:40
my hair is really healthy.
1:13:42
I’m just going to let it gray naturally.
1:13:44
It’s starting to silver up a little bit and I like that.
1:13:48
I own that.
1:13:51
No more bleach.
1:13:52
The vintage dresses, man, they aren’t stretchy enough [laughs]
1:13:57
. I can’t do it anymore
1:14:02
[laughs] . I would say I’m still relatively even-tempered.
1:14:10
Pornographer—I used to write.
1:14:11
I would write porn, like lesbian erotica or whatever, shit.
1:14:19
I don’t really write that anymore [laughs]
1:14:23
. And mean butch boys, always.
1:14:25
Always and forever.
1:14:29
Oh, great.
1:14:30
Thank you.
1:14:31
Is there anything else that you’d like to talk about?
1:14:34
Well, if anything you ever want to ask just go ahead and ask.
1:14:37
I mean, did you see anything else in the book that struck your imagination?
1:14:43
It’s in the other one, which we don’t have.
1:14:45
But you did a lot of collage work and I thought that was really amazing.
1:14:49
I love collage.
1:14:50
I think that was a really powerful.
1:14:54
Yeah, this is the second one, right?
1:14:56
The first one is my favorite of the two, but yeah.
1:15:03
I would say if you go, you guys can YouTube the shit out of this now.
1:15:08
Go look up some DIY fire eating and try it.
1:15:14
It’s so empowering.
1:15:15
It really is.
1:15:16
It’s very empowering.
1:15:18
Yeah.
1:15:19
My niece and nephew that I was living with when I first got into the bigger part of
1:15:26
this Avenger stuff, we used to host, my sister and I, Sunday brunch every week.
1:15:31
All the queers would come over.
1:15:35
Some of those folks were in the Portland Avengers and eating fire.
1:15:38
We did a fire eating workshop in our front yard.
1:15:41
That’s what they got to see growing up.
1:15:43
Arthur missed the fire eating WTO era of his mother [laughs] . You know,
1:15:56
it’s not as hard as you think.
1:15:58
It’s really empowering.
1:16:00
Do you guys have a tight-knit community down here?
1:16:03
What’s it like to be queer in Corvallis these days.
1:16:06
[Takes deep breath] I don’t know if that’s for the camera.
1:16:11
Yeah, we can be done.
1:16:12
Do you want to be done?
1:16:16
That was great.
1:16:16
Thank you.
1:16:16
That was really cool.
