00:01
Ok we are recording here.
00:04
Can you please tell me your name for the audio?
00:08
Yeah, my name is José González.
00:10
With a “z” or a—
00:13
“Z” of course.
00:18
So for this project we’re going to talk a little bit about your roots,
00:23
you’re welcome to speak in English or in Spanish, whichever feels most
00:26
comfortable, and then also we can talk a little bit about how you came
00:31
to Portland and started this theatre.
00:35
Great!
00:36
So where were you born?
00:38
I was born in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.
00:41
Missouri…
00:42
Yeah.
00:44
How did you make your way to…
00:46
Well actually I didn’t make my way there
00:50
[laughs] somebody else did.
00:51
My father was stationed at the army base there, so Fort Leonard Wood is right next
00:59
to Waynesville, which is sort of like in the southern central part of Missouri and
01:05
you know he was an army sergeant and my mother obviously was his wife and beyond
01:13
that I don’t know what he was doing there.
01:14
I didn’t ask at the time [laughs].
01:17
Of course, and where’s your family from?
01:20
Originally from South Texas.
01:22
My mother and father both were raised in Corpus Christi, just
01:29
about 150 miles north of the border,
01:33
and most of our extended family in terms of ancestors, within let’s
01:39
say the last 150-200 years were from that Northern México area, based out
01:45
of Monterrey and into south Texas.
01:49
[Hey how ya doing [to person walking by]]
01:51
Corpus Christi, my mom is actually from there.
01:53
Really?
01:54
Maybe we went to school together.
01:56
That’s entirely possible.
01:57
What was her name?
01:58
Her name is Christy Hughes.
02:00
Hmm don’t remember.
02:03
Well, the neighborhood school that I went to, the elementary was called Elizabeth
02:08
Elementary and they changed the name to T.G. Allen to basically honor the
02:15
principal that was there at the time I was in school, and I can remember only two
02:24
non-Latino students in there at the time.
02:27
And it was a really tall, her name was Kathy Angermiller and she was
02:37
like, we were all like waist-high to her you know she was like giant.
02:41
And then I think there was another one I think it was Barbara and I can’t
02:48
remember Barbara’s last name, but it was a very Latino school—99.9% and pretty
02:55
much the same happened when we went to junior high school and there, there were
02:58
a few more because they were obviously coming from different schools, but
03:02
still probably a handful of non-Latinos at the school, and the only African
03:07
Americans at that time were special education students because we were
03:11
still kind of in the segregated system.
03:15
It was way back in the day.
03:16
So did you go to school in Missouri, or did you move back to Texas?
03:20
Well we sort of had an interesting route because my father was a soldier and of
03:24
course like a lot of soldiers you get assigned to different places so at about
03:28
1 year old, he was shipped to Germany to shoot guard and so we went to Germany and
03:37
I spent about I think about two-two and a half years there as an infant or toddler,
03:43
my next sister was born in Germany, and then we returned back to the states I
03:52
think it would’ve been probably about when I was four or in that area, three
03:58
or four, and he was stationed in El Paso.
04:04
I forget what the name of the base was there, and we lived in El Paso
04:11
for at least a year or two and then we moved back to Corpus Christi in
04:19
time for me to basically start first grade, or before that, so I started
04:26
first grade when I was six, about six and a half I think you know roughly.
04:33
I should’ve asked this at the beginning, but what year were you born?
04:37
I was born in ’52.
04:38
Ok.
04:39
So how long did you stay in Corpus Christi?
04:41
I stayed until I was 15.
04:43
Until the summer of ’67 and that’s when we moved up to Oregon
04:50
and moved here to Portland.
04:55
We spent a year in Northeast Portland in a rental house, and then the next
05:01
year we bought a house over in the southeast side, which is actually very
05:04
close to here, about a mile away, and that’s where basically I continued high
05:13
school, Benson Polytech, and then from, graduated in 1970, and then
05:15
went onto university from there.
05:18
What was it like moving from a place like Corpus Christi, TX right on
05:22
the border to Oregon in the 60s?
05:25
Well we weren’t quite on the border, we were damn close, like 150 miles, there’s a
05:30
lot of difference between the valley where you know would be the border and Corpus,
05:35
but not a huge amount, it’s like everybody was related to everybody else, basically
05:43
I mean it was a huge cultural difference.
05:44
I mean first of all there were hardly any Latinos living up here
05:48
or at least any that were visible.
05:52
I don’t even think there was a Mexican restaurant in town, but
05:55
that may be exaggeration, but I definitely felt like yeah, yeah you
06:00
had no neighborhood connections at all, the culture was very different.
06:05
Like I remember in Texas if you wanted to visit somebody, you just
06:10
went to their house and dropped in and if they weren’t there, you
06:13
just went to somebody else’s house.
06:14
Here it felt like you had to have an invitation, or you had to set
06:18
an appointment with everybody.
06:21
Very little was happening outside, everything was inside homes whereas
06:25
in Texas we never were in the house at all, you know we were always out
06:30
in the calle playing and also you know your entire neighborhood, at
06:35
least where I grew up at the time,
06:39
pretty much everybody knew everybody else, everybody knew my mother and my
06:44
uncles, ‘cause they’d all gone to school together, they’d all hung out, they
06:48
knew the cousins and the relations.
06:51
So you were pretty much pinned from the very beginning, you know, because
06:55
everybody knew who you were, when you were born, what you were about, whether
06:59
you were good or you were bad, so in a sense it was like a big extended
07:05
family, and then of course you know with the exception of elementary school, a
07:13
very small number of Anglos, everybody was like, most were working class.
07:21
I think in my neighborhood we were like a little step above the projects where
07:27
most of the people were craftsmen or working class and we had homes, we had a
07:33
little house, you know, we had yards, we had all of that, cars, but just across
07:39
Morgan Street to the north, you got into the projects and most of the folks there
07:47
were you know basically what you would call like subsidized housing, although
07:51
I don’t think they had it in those days.
07:53
Most of
07:57
them were Spanish-speaking and that’s where you also have more of the, sort
08:00
of the gang issues, you know, or the gang community, yeah, pachucos, yeah.
08:07
Did you grow up speaking Spanish?
08:09
No, no actually my mother told me that my father actually refused to have
08:15
Spanish spoken in the household and part of it I think was a generational issue.
08:22
I found out later that almost none of my cousins speak Spanish, or speak
08:27
it as a native speaker, and because we were basically I mean Spanish in
08:34
that time was very much considered to be a dirty language and there was a
08:40
significant amount of prejudice and racism, particularly toward my older
08:47
generation so I think the idea was they didn’t want to labor us with that.
08:53
So
08:55
my father wouldn’t allowed Spanish to be spoken at home, although both he and
08:59
my mom could speak it fluently, and then occasionally together, the rest of us
09:05
were all like, speaking English [laughs].
09:11
Did you ever experience discrimination?
09:14
As a kid, do you have any memory of that?
09:16
Well you know I think
09:20
there’s things I think that when you’re young and you’re growing up in an
09:24
environment where it’s pretty much part of the culture that you’re not really
09:27
conscious of, and I think mos—I mean there was a thing that happen that I distinctly
09:38
remember when I was a kid that we were at a place in Corpus called Six Points
09:46
and this is where like I don’t know six streets converged or something and it
09:52
was kind of a neighborhood shopping area kind of thing if you think back to the
09:58
sixties and I remember once, we used to go riding around with our bikes a lot and I
10:04
remember once we were just there at that location on our bikes, it was close—it
10:10
was a bus stop kind of area, and I just remember somebody coming by and like
10:15
throwing a bottle at us and cursing us, you know, basically for being who we were.
10:22
We weren’t doing anything, we didn’t even, they were doing a drive by, and
10:25
just like “you dirty Mexicans,” and things like that, so that happened when I was
10:33
young, I was probably 14, 13 and it was a big shock for me, and I think part of
10:39
the shock was because we were insulated in a way we were in a majority Latino
10:44
community, we basically stayed in our community, it was evident that there were
10:49
other neighborhoods we couldn’t go to, or shouldn’t go to, or we weren’t wanted in,
10:54
that we really probably didn’t experience overt racism because we just didn’t
11:00
encounter the other culture that much.
11:03
Later on when we moved up to Portland, there was a kind of a
11:07
different scenario going on there and I think it has a lot to do with
11:10
sort of where the people come from.
11:13
So there was, you know there was like I said that part like you couldn’t just go
11:21
visit somebody, you had to be invited, very kind of like, I don’t want to say
11:27
isolated, but very private kind of people that you know maybe held their beliefs
11:33
very closely but it was only in sort of usual circumstances that you got a reveal
11:40
and I remember something happening, I think it was probably in I think it was
11:47
like in ‘73 or ‘74, so I spent a year studying in Vienna, in my junior year.
12:00
I spent my junior year studying in Vienna and when I came back, I didn’t want to
12:06
go back to school, it was just like, so I just took a leave of absence, sort
12:12
of needed some time to decompress as it were, and in addition to Vienna, we
12:16
traveled through the Middle East and you know up into Afghanistan, so it was just
12:21
too much to come back and go to Santa Clara, and sort of that middle class white
12:27
school kind of thing, and I just wanted to chill, so one of the things I did
12:32
was I got a job over at Ma Bell AT&T and
12:37
as a teletypist,
12:40
one of the skills I gleaned when I was in high school was I could type pretty
12:44
good and so I got assigned to this department and what we did generally, what
12:52
a teletypist—what I did as a teletypist is that basically I typed up job orders
13:00
and sent them off to field offices, so like these guys out here, you know we’ve
13:04
been saying you need to go to this place and you need to bring this equipment and
13:09
you need to install these phones or these services or these trunks and stuff like
13:13
that so it was pretty ordinary stuff and so I did that and then and you know we
13:20
had I don’t know probably about ten people in that department and we were all kind
13:26
of in the same part of the building and I was young and I had nothing else to
13:33
do so anytime they offered overtime, I took the overtime so I would be there 9-5
13:40
and then work into the evenings putting out the orders and stuff like that, and
13:45
so one night I was working there with another young woman who was also employed
13:49
by the department and out of the blue she just said, “You know you just blew
13:55
everybody’s mind around here.” And I went like, “I don’t know what you’re talking
13:59
about,” you know, and she goes, “Well,” she says, “we learned about you coming
14:05
up here like the week before or a few days before that you would be assigned
14:12
here,” and she said, “we had heard that José González was gonna come work in the
14:18
department and everybody got to talking.
14:21
Oh he’s gonna be lazy; he’s not gonna learn the job, you know, he’s gonna do
14:25
this and do that, he can’t speak English so we’re gonna have to figure out how
14:29
we communicate with him, and then you walk in here,” and she says, “you’re
14:33
college educated, you work twice as hard as everybody else, you learned the
14:38
job that usually takes six weeks in two weeks,” and she says, “you just blew
14:42
everybody’s mind.” So that I think sort of was that reveal, I didn’t have any
14:47
inkling of that the whole time I was working there, nobody ever said anything
14:51
racial to me, or prejudicial that I could be offended at, but it had been there
14:58
and it was there and you know maybe in a positive way I was able to change the
15:04
way people thought about people from another culture, or Latinos in particular,
15:10
but up until that point I was pretty
15:14
clueless.
15:14
During high school you had the usual things, I mean I think that was the first
15:17
time somebody called me a taco vender, you know, but I guess I just wasn’t as
15:24
sensitive enough to really think about that as being racial or prejudicial
15:29
because you could give it as good as you got, you know, so and I’m sure I did
15:35
[laughs].
15:35
But that was typical high school kind of stuff and I grew up in a culture
15:41
too where, and I still had to be very careful about it, where it was kind
15:46
of a sign of affection that you were never nice to your cousins or your
15:51
friends, so we still kind of meet up today, you know 70 years old almost and
15:57
my best friend is still alive, and I would still say, hi ugly how you doing?
16:02
[Laughs] and then you go into this insulting kind of thing and then you go
16:05
out and eat and have a drink together and have fun so you know I think I
16:10
guess I just didn’t feel the same kind of thing in high school because I was
16:13
kind of used to that give and take and insults were a sign of affection [laugh].
16:19
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
16:23
I have three sisters, well actually two living, one passed away in ’89, yeah.
16:30
And are they, younger older?
16:32
Younger, I’m the oldest.
16:35
So when you moved to Oregon, everybody moved?
16:38
Yeah, yeah it was, it was a huge, huge thing.
16:45
You know.
16:47
Yeah… it’s a sens—I’ve talked about it before, but it’s a sensitive part.
16:52
So somewhere around the time when I was five, I think I was five, or si—no maybe
16:59
I was seven, somewhere around seven, or
17:01
I forget the exact year, because you know you’re quite young at that time,
17:05
it was I think in first grade, my mother and father were separated, and
17:10
so for like seven years, we never saw or heard from him at all, and it was
17:18
just like he disappeared off the planet—
17:20
—from your father?
17:21
Yeah, yeah.
17:22
And you know he had been abusive to my mom.
17:25
When I was younger I remember seeing that as a child, and part of it had to
17:30
do with he had a significant, he had a bad drinking problem and evidently,
17:35
he unfortunately had started drinking at a very early age and of course it
17:40
just doesn’t get better, it gets worse.
17:42
So finally my mother
17:47
told him to get out, you know she, I mean she did that long suffering kind of thing,
17:52
and I think it got to a point finally where she just had to say kick him out.
17:58
So for seven years we didn’t have a father, and my mother was our sole,
18:03
I mean she took care of us, she found work and basically raised the four of
18:11
us and paid the house off and took in laundry from the neighbors, we did all
18:17
kinds of things to make extra money to basically pay the bills and maybe
18:23
even go to a movie once in a while.
18:26
And then interestingly enough unbeknownst to me at the time, he
18:30
contacted her, so this would’ve been when I was about 14, about seven
18:34
years later, about getting a divorce,
18:42
and so then they started having some kind of conversation remotely I think because
18:46
he wasn’t there, he was up here, actually.
18:50
And then some strange thing happened so in the process of discussing
18:56
getting a divorce, they decided to get back together again.
19:01
[AG: Oh.] Yeah.
19:03
And so couple things happened: my mom came to me, because I was the eldest
19:08
and as far as she was concerned I had the most investment there in terms of
19:13
friendships and school and stuff and asked my permission, which I thought was really
19:20
strange you know and then and well not necessarily get back together again but
19:27
about moving I think she was committed to getting back together again, but the idea
19:33
that we would move to start a new life somewhere else was big, was big, ‘cause
19:40
we had basically never been out of Corpus Christi other than that initial travel
19:44
when I was a child, but once we landed in Corpus, we been there you know 7 years was
19:49
my life and so I said yes, and I think I really didn’t know anything about Oregon.
19:59
I remember telling my friends, they didn’t know anything about Oregon,
20:01
nobody knew Oregon existed and
20:06
we should have we’re not stupid but it’s kind of like… but
20:13
I thought at the time and I do recall that it was for my mom and I loved my mom
20:18
and that was gonna make her happy then we would do it so we piled the entire family,
20:25
my four—my three sisters, my mother and my father, in a Ford Falcon [AG:
20:32
wow] everything that we brought up was in that ford falcon and in
20:36
the truck, and yeah that was it.
20:38
Everything else we got rid of.
20:41
We kept the house, but we rented it and I think my aunt took care of managing
20:48
that for a while and then everything else just kind of went away, and then
20:53
drove up, [AG: long drive] through
20:58
new Mexico, we actually stopped in, I think it was in Albuquerque my father
21:04
had a friend there from his soldiering days and we stayed with them, they were
21:08
actually pretty close—or was that El Paso?
21:12
I don’t remember, it was El Paso, and then we stopped in New Mexico, I think,
21:17
and then we came up I-5 all the way up to Portland and then settled in our new home.
21:25
Wow.
21:25
Yeah.
21:26
A long journey.
21:27
I know, I know, I know.
21:28
So once you were here, you attend college here in Oregon…?
21:33
Well I was here at the age of 15 so it was in my—here the high schools were
21:40
four years, down there they were three years, so I started in my sophomore
21:46
year at Benson Polytechnic over here on 12th, which at that time was an all-boys
21:51
school, so add that on top of everything else so you go from like a cultural
21:57
thing, then to go to an all-boys school and you know I’d been going to school
22:02
with girls all my life, so it was kind of like what the hell are we doing here?
22:06
My father was really excited about it, you know, he was like “Gotta go to Benson,
22:10
gotta go to Benson, gotta go to Benson” and at the time I had no idea what I was
22:14
doing, I was just trying to make people happy and try to figure things out.
22:19
And feeling really lost, I mean, I think, I once described this in an article
22:26
that was done on me, and I said I feel like I spent almost half the year in my
22:34
bedroom that first year because I was just like, it was just so strange outside.
22:39
The neighborhood was strange, the people were strange, the houses were strange,
22:44
and you know I was just in culture shock.
22:48
I’ve always been somewhat of a private person, so obviously that wasn’t an issue,
22:54
but yeah, it took a little bit to adjust.
22:59
And then once you graduated high school, did you stay here?
23:03
No, I graduated in 1970 and then I went to University of Santa Clara.
23:09
Is that in California?
23:11
Yeah Northern California.
23:13
And so then can you tell me a little bit about your college experience?
23:16
Yeah
23:19
it was an interesting thing because I was looking at a lot of
23:22
different schools at that time.
23:24
I was, I guess what you would call one of the top tier students.
23:28
I had a GPA of 3.75, and good SAT scores so, and I was definitely motivated
23:37
to go to college, it wasn’t sort of an afterthought, it was sort of like
23:41
something that I had been thinking about for many years, so I was looking
23:46
locally at Willamette University, and Oregon State, which is a state
23:51
school, and I think that time we were big fans of the Beavers and stuff.
23:57
And then nationally a couple of Ivy League schools, and then one day that
24:08
senior, or was it junior year I think it was, was a very active year for
24:14
campus recruiters, they would come up, and I thought it was a great way to
24:18
get out of class [laughs] so I went to this kind of a recruitment session for
24:25
Santa Clara, and I didn’t really think anything about it, it was, you know they
24:31
gave us information about the school and talked about it and there was maybe a
24:34
handful of us there and they asked some questions and that’s all I remember,
24:37
I don’t remember anything, but the recruiter was really active about getting
24:41
in touch with me afterwards and I hadn’t thought about it, that I was probably
24:53
a sprinkling of Latino students statewide that were, I think I was considered to
25:04
be an Oregon scholar, I got some sort of certificate for being an Oregon
25:09
scholar, I don’t what I did for it, but I guess it was just getting good grades.
25:13
So he was very active about recruiting me to go to Santa Clara, and so they
25:20
offered me a full ride, at least for the first year, not for all four years, but
25:24
basically at that time I think when I graduated from college, I owed, I had a
25:31
loan of $1500 which was money actually I borrowed so I could have spending money
25:37
in Europe, so I could’ve been 0 when I got out of there, and of course considering
25:43
what kind of commitments young people have now today was a drop in the bucket.
25:48
I think I got rid of it in a couple years.
25:50
It was nothing, but again it was just spending money.
25:54
So I got scholarships and I got work study and I did a variety of things and
25:59
I had a little bit of money I think from the GI bill that helped, yeah, I think
26:06
I had that, so that also helped pay for some expenses, so I didn’t really have
26:13
any issues with money from the school.
26:16
But it was really kind of, how do you call it when somebody was actively
26:21
wanting you to go to school and then offering you a really generous
26:29
scholarship and support to do that, and it was a Jesuit school, it was a
26:34
private school, high quality education.
26:39
It was hard to turn down, and then I found also great, you know it’s one
26:46
thing to go an hour away from home, it’s another thing to go an hour and a half,
26:51
it’s another to go like a whole day away from home, at least driving-wise
26:55
so I felt good about going that far, even though it was a challenge, because
27:01
that was the year I graduated and my father passed away, and so then
27:07
I was leaving my mom and my sisters up here by themselves but you know.
27:16
What did you study?
27:19
Initially in the first couple years, was undeclared, so I was confused [laughs].
27:28
I didn’t really care you know I mean I think that initially I was, I really
27:34
hadn’t, didn’t have a career mindset, I sort of thought about either going
27:42
maybe into law or engineering, something like that, but the opportunity to not
27:51
have to make a decision in the first two years, so basically you spent most
27:55
of that time getting your requirements out of the way was really great so I
28:00
didn’t have that pressure that boom I have to do this so I can get a job.
28:06
In the second year, or at the conclusion of the second year, the university offered
28:14
a unique opportunity to design your own major and so the theory behind that was
28:25
that university were traditionally, going back obviously, were places of learning
28:34
and knowledge and becoming better human beings, not about going to get a job,
28:42
and I liked that, I liked that idea that you could be there just to be better
28:48
informed and a better person and you didn’t have to like “Ah I gotta get an
28:53
engineering degree or a law degree.” So I designed my own major and my
29:00
primary focus during that time was on philosophy, psychology, and art history.
29:08
And so I basically cherry-picked all the classes I was interested in and
29:13
put ‘em in a bundle and wrote up a case for them and they granted it to me.
29:18
So I think I was one of the first students in the university to design their own
29:22
major and graduate with unfortunately what is called General Humanities
29:27
degree, but actually now that I think about it it’s pretty neat, pretty neat.
29:30
Yeah.
29:31
So you went to Vienna for a whole year?
29:34
Junior yeah.
29:36
Were you studying there?
29:38
Actually the same thing, but more of an emphasis on philosophy and art history.
29:46
Little less on psychology even thought that was the home of
29:48
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.
29:50
I did study those, and actually I have a library of Carl Jung’s complete works,
29:57
and read Freud and then a few other psychologists along the time, because
30:04
they kind of mingle things a little bit, you know Carl Jung is—you know
30:08
he was a student of Freud so there’s definite his—how do you call it—definite
30:17
early stage understanding of human psychology, but that was also impacted
30:23
to considerable extent by the—how do you call it—not so much the philosophy,
30:29
but the cultural and almost like the DNA part of you and me, he was talking
30:33
about the collective unconsciousness, and stereotypes, and different things
30:37
like that, he was blending in what was at that time was a very common
30:42
practice which was to be in exploration of our world beyond our sort of white,
30:48
Eurocentric ideas and to incorporate Middle Eastern, Eastern ways of thinking
30:56
and philosophy, and Carl Jung was really good about doing that, he was pulling
31:00
from everything, and then of course one of them was Joseph Campbell, who
31:09
took that to another level as he began to explore mythology, collective
31:15
unconscious and archetypes and other things in our current world, so anyway
31:21
I was kind of into all of that stuff.
31:23
What was it like being out of the country?
31:25
God, it was pretty cool, pretty cool, yeah we were all like,
31:29
what the fuck is going on here?
31:30
[laughs] sorry don’t quote that, you know like whoa, I think
31:36
with all, I don’t know if there wasn’t exceptions, all of us we came from
31:41
all over the country, you know east coast west coast, central, south,
31:49
most of us had never been outside the country before and even the
31:54
time that I spent as a child in Europe I don’t remember hardly, I
31:59
don’t remember anything honestly.
32:00
You know I can see pictures, and I can manufacture memory, but realistically
32:05
I don’t remember anything, so I think we were all walking around with
32:11
eyeballs you know the size of our heads because like what the hell was this?
32:16
But it was great.
32:17
It was really great.
32:18
You know all that exposure
32:24
it was sobering in so many ways, sobering to see how limited we were in terms
32:31
of our exposure, but not universally, there were some students coming from
32:37
obviously better circumstances than me,
32:43
or communities where the cultural
32:48
landscape was much richer, but there were a few like me who grew
32:55
up in poverty, never saw a play, never went to a concert, and
33:02
Benson was a technical school and we never did anything like that.
33:05
And so
33:08
we were exposed to things for the first time.
33:10
Like I saw my first play there; I saw my first opera there.
33:15
I met playwrights.
33:16
I
33:18
encountered the world of philosophy and I learned a lot
33:24
more about our cultural history.
33:27
I studied
33:31
philosophy of the east there interestingly enough, Buddhism, Tao, other things
33:42
like that, and then of course I traveled all through Europe and every time you
33:46
crossed the border it was like another, well it is, but it was like another
33:50
country, so Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland, England, and then traveling
33:59
to Turkey and Iran and Afghanistan, again you know you had all of these
34:06
incredible cultural encounters, the people, the places, the art, you name it.
34:14
Is that part of how you got involved in the arts?
34:19
[Laughs] Yes.
34:21
Very clever.
34:25
[laughs]
34:25
Can you tell me a little bit about your pathway to arriving—I know this is
34:28
fast forwarding through kind of a lot, but I want to make sure we touch on—
34:30
You sure this is going to be documented?
34:33
Ok I’ll have to go in and…You know I’ve told these stories
34:36
before, so it’s not a secret.
34:38
It seems, sometimes it seems like it doesn’t make any sense because I think
34:45
we’re so geared to make a decision, you do this and then you do that, and
34:53
I think the real story is that life often makes the decision for us, but
34:57
are we willing to follow it or not?
35:00
So I mentioned the fact that one of the things that I encountered was the study
35:11
of Asian I would say philosophy, and
35:18
[greets someone walking in the room, makes sure she is okay
35:19
carrying a load of laundry for
35:31
the show]
35:40
so anyway, that was one of the—probably the most fascinating class that I
35:47
ever had in any university setting and it was taught by Arnold Kaiserly who
35:55
actually was a count, whose father was Count Herman Kaiserly, and he was a
36:00
philosopher, and he really studied both traditional philosophy and there’s another
36:07
word…esoteric philosophy and I think that probably the esoteric was really
36:13
fascinating to us but also that period of time in the 70s and late 60s was when we
36:19
were really rediscovering the world around us, and that was the time when people
36:25
were suddenly discovering yoga and Zen and meditation and Confucius and Lao Tzu
36:32
and all these influences that before that we didn’t know about, you know we were
36:36
very western-oriented and suddenly this whole universe of thought and expression
36:44
and new religions was being opened to us as well as new cultures so I remember my
36:49
roommate and I, George, we, I think we had class like one day a week, it was three
36:56
hours long, and we would just tank up on espresso, and I would go into that class
37:02
like BZZZZ and we would, I would literally write down every word he said, and I still
37:09
have the books, I still have all of the notes that I took of all of the, it was
37:14
just amazing, so anyway, one day his wife, who was a yoga practitioner, Wilhelmina,
37:23
for some reason I can’t remember why, we did a class or a session at their
37:27
home, somewhere in inner-Vienna, and I remember going over there, I couldn’t
37:32
find it if my life depended on it now and what she was gonna do was she
37:37
was gonna cast our horoscopes, ‘cause that’s also something she did, she was
37:43
an astrologer and of course she was like a perfect partner to her husband.
37:46
They were into all of that, you know.
37:49
And so she did everybody’s natal horoscope, and then in the session there
37:55
proceeded to read it to each one of us.
37:58
Not in depth but at least give us some highlights, and the thing that when
38:03
they came to this section, the period where your profession is identified,
38:09
she said to me: you will succeed in a profession either as a banker or a
38:14
theatre artist, or the banking or the theatre, and I remember going like what?
38:20
I said so banking was completely anti-establishment, you know like forget
38:26
it that’s not gonna happen, and actually economics was the only class I ever
38:31
got a C in, and so I said obviously that’s not it, that’s not for me.
38:38
The theatre, I had seen my first play that year, and interestingly enough my
38:43
first play was William Shakespeare’s Coriolanus at Stratford-upon-Avon, the
38:48
home of William Shakespeare, and I’m going like uh, that was it, you know.
38:55
And I mean I’d seen a few things subsequent, but I never thought it
39:00
was a career move or anything like that, but the idea fascinated me.
39:03
Banking?
39:04
Pshh, out the window, not even, it’s just not—it’s too establishment for me.
39:09
But the theatre kept you know intriguing me, I read Shakespeare,
39:14
I read Tennessee Williams, you know,
39:22
so when I came back to the states, the idea continued to nag me, but
39:28
I also had to find a job and so one of the thoughts that I had,
39:37
so I must have done the telephone thing before that… yeah I think I did because
39:43
when I came back to the states after that I said well I have to find a job and
39:51
my roommate at the time, who we went to high school at the time, his father was a
39:56
boiler maker, which is the welder’s union nowadays and I had done some welding in
40:02
high school, as part of my studies at Benson because it was a polytechnic school
40:08
and so he said well we’re gonna send you out to try out for a job on the shipyards.
40:15
I said okay, so I went out to the shipyards and they gave me like a
40:19
welding test, and I failed it pretty bad [laughs] they were laughing, and I was
40:25
like daaamn, why did you do this to me?
40:27
I hadn’t welded in years so I was like obviously very rusty and I came back
40:32
and I told Mr. Becker and I said you know I failed the test, I’m totally
40:38
embarrassed and he says, [imitates voice] “arggh like don’t worry about it, we’ll
40:41
send you out for another one, you’ll get a job,” and I thought about it and
40:45
I thought you know he will do that, he will do that, ‘cause these are the old
40:50
guys and they’ll get me into the union whether I’m any good or not, and I
40:54
thought I’m gonna go down to the theatre
40:58
and ask them for a job.
40:59
And I did.
40:59
Which theatre?
41:00
I went down to, it’s no longer in existence, it was
41:04
the Portland Civic Theatre.
41:06
It was over on the westside, close to the stadium.
41:11
It was the oldest community theatre west of the Mississippi by that time it
41:15
was like over 50 years old, and it had two performing spaces, a traditional
41:20
proscenium house, sat I think around 300 people, and then a small theatre in the
41:27
round, like around 100 capacity I think there was, and so I just walked in one
41:33
day and told them I wanted a job and they all kind of laughed at me and said you
41:41
know we don’t have a job but if you’d like to volunteer, the guys in the scene
41:44
shop can use some help, I said sure and so I went down, introduced myself to them
41:51
and they put me to work, and boom you know first day was just great, I mean
41:55
they were showing me how to saw things and measure and not kill myself and all
42:00
that kind of stuff and I kept going back each day and it seemed like every day
42:05
I would come in and say I’m looking for a job and they would say we don’t have
42:08
any, ok let’s go to work, and then I started, I worked on some shows or worked
42:13
on a show and two weeks going down there every day, working day and night, at the
42:20
end of two weeks everybody quit and they came and asked me if I wanted a job.
42:25
Do you know why they quit?
42:28
I think they were burned out.
42:30
It’s a hard profession.
42:32
It takes a lot out of you.
42:34
I remember when I saw the people there, they all looked grey you know, like all
42:40
like prisoners because they’d been down in the basement and never saw the light
42:43
of day and but it was yeah, yeah I had no reference for that, but they all quit,
42:50
the whole technical crew, so they sat me down and said would you like a job?
42:56
And I went like what do you think I’ve been saying?
43:00
[laughs]
43:00
So that was like your first job in the theatre field.
43:03
But I think that first day that I was there, I knew that was the place I was
43:07
supposed to be and that was following that idea about the theatre as a profession.
43:13
The stars told you.
43:15
I think so.
43:16
That’s incredible.
43:16
Yeah.
43:17
So how did you arrive here at Milagro?
43:20
Well you know I’d been in the business since that time,
43:24
started I think in September of
43:31
1975 and for I think a period of about six months thought I would quit the
43:36
theatre and do something useful with my life, but that didn’t work out.
43:39
So I went back to the theatre, and,
43:45
and basically I haven’t turned back since so…after I did the Portland Civic for
43:57
about 15 months of just nonstop theatre, I think I did over 25 productions that year
44:03
both at the Civic and in other theatre companies around town, so basically
44:07
I was trying everything and anything and I played—I mean I was carpenter,
44:13
I designed shows, I did lighting, I ran shows, I even acted in shows.
44:19
So basically I was just like, dived into it.
44:24
And I was single, I didn’t have to worry about anything other
44:28
than being able to pay my rent.
44:30
I was making $300 a month, which was a huge amount for me, I
44:35
didn’t care, and that covered my apartment and yeah, you know.
44:44
So any case after 15 months I was pretty close to being burned out and
44:50
I decided to take a trip to Mexico, it was with a girlfriend at the time
44:57
and we went down to Mexico then came back to Wisconsin, where she was from
45:04
basically to leave her there, you know,
45:08
got a bus ticket, and
45:14
my mom had wisely contacted me while I was in Wisconsin and said you know
45:19
our house in Texas needs a lot of work can you take care of that and I think
45:25
she knew what was happening and I thought it was a great opportunity to
45:27
get out of dodge, you know, leave her behind, start anew, so I jumped on it.
45:33
Next day I was on a bus down to Texas, and my house was a mess, our family
45:38
home, because I had all these skills I had developed in the theatre about
45:43
building and stuff, I spent a lot of time rebuilding the house, and I was hanging
45:50
out on the beach, and hanging out with my friends and family and I would do this
45:56
thing where, one of the first things I did with the house was tear out the kitchen
46:00
entirely so I couldn’t cook, so that meant I had to go visit my family every night.
46:07
[AG: Haha, oh darn.] Every time you know “oh quieres comida?
46:10
Ya mira está” or whatever I was definitely not starving [laughs]
46:20
and then my aunt interestingly enough one of my aunts kept saying, there’s a
46:24
theatre down there, there’s a theatre over there you should go check it out,
46:27
there’s a theatre over there, check it out, and I was like no I’m done with
46:32
that you know I’m just gonna sit at home, do yoga, do translating, you know.
46:36
I was translating manuscripts from German to English so I’m gonna do that and then
46:44
I don’t know one day I said ah shit I’ll just go check it out, so I went down
46:49
there, and I kind of saw this guy, he was like, he looked like the guys that
46:54
all quit two weeks later he’s like kahh, all burnt out, all all, and I said you
47:02
know I’ve done a little bit of theatre, can, you know do you need some help?
47:07
He said yeah, sure, you know, and so I built a few things for them, for him, you
47:14
know that was it just like a day, I built some step units and other things like that
47:20
and then I went home and I guess I must have given them my contact information
47:24
because like literally that afternoon or the next day they called me and asked me
47:31
if I could come in and talk and I was like ok you know I was, I think I was tired
47:37
of being a bum because basically I was a bum, I didn’t have a job, and I was living
47:43
off of savings, and I went in there and they said we’d like to offer you the job
47:49
of being Technical Director here and I said what about the other guy, and they
47:52
said as soon as you came in here he quit
47:55
[laughs] and I went like oh god, history repeats itself.
48:00
So anyway, I spent five years there, and then ultimately decided to go to
48:07
graduate school, and I applied to three schools across the country and got
48:13
accepted to all of them and that was North Carolina, Carnegie Mellon, and
48:21
UCLA.
48:21
I decided on UCLA mainly because it had a strong industry presence, also
48:27
it was on the west coast so it was closer to my family and I think that
48:33
Carnegie Mellon really came in late so basically I just had to make a
48:37
decision, so that would’ve been more interesting to me because they were
48:42
really specialized in scenic design there.
48:45
Is that what you were studying?
48:46
Yeah that’s what I was doing.
48:47
You know so I had done a little design when I was in Portland, but there I
48:53
had my own house, I had like a 42-foot proscenium theatre, 500-seat house, I
49:00
have you know line sets and I installed additional line sets so I could fly
49:04
scenery in, I had a real scene shop on the same level of the stage, so and the
49:10
whole point of Civic, we built everything in the basement and had to carry it
49:13
upstairs, kind of like we have to do here, but there it was just boom, wheel
49:18
it around the corner and we’re there, and you know, so I actively started designing
49:27
and basically was the resident designer so I designed all the shows there.
49:32
At UCLA?
49:33
No, no in Texas, but that was what led me to sort of enhance my understanding of
49:39
design and that’s what I went to UCLA for.
49:43
So it an MFA?
49:45
Mhm, yeah, MFA program and, but, well I don’t want to disparage them but they
49:53
didn’t have a really great design program for my, now that I’m out of here, but
49:59
you know I got to do a lot of stuff.
50:02
And I think it was more of a practicum than actually a study.
50:06
But you know we did things that I think certainly benefit.
50:10
In any case, that’s where I met my wife, my wife, Dañel.
50:16
And so I graduated, and after I graduated, we decided to move up to Portland and
50:23
when we came up to Portland, we said what the hell do we do, there’s no work
50:28
here, we did find work with some of the local companies, but there was really
50:33
a small number, and of course we, even though I had long had a footprint here
50:38
‘cause I came up every year to visit my family, and I hung out with the theatre
50:42
people and I did little projects while I was up her, it still was not the same as
50:46
living here, and so when we came up here we picked up a job at Portland Civic or
50:53
picked up a job at Willamette Repertory or you know something at Jefferson
50:59
High School, or something like that so we were piecing together parts of it.
51:02
And then one day we said we need to do something different and one of my friends
51:09
said why don’t we start a theatre company?
51:10
[laughs]
51:12
and we did!
51:15
And…
51:15
—what year was that?
51:16
It was 198— well we started in ’84, and officially I always date us to ’84
51:23
because that’s when we had the idea and that’s when we selected the show and we
51:27
started the preparations and we opened I believe it was in January of ’85, or
51:33
pretty soon afterwards, and then I don’t know what happened but before you knew it
51:40
we were, we didn’t really have any money so it was like hand to mouth in a sense.
51:46
That first show we produced we took all of our savings and basically used
51:50
that to fund the project ‘cause nobody knew who we were and nobody was gonna
51:54
give us money, and we actually made a little bit of money off of that,
52:00
which is, I tell people that’s the last time I made any money off the theatre.
52:07
But it started us on a different track because we were both designers and we had
52:14
to shift to be producers in that process and I guess, well I don’t really know I
52:22
don’t think we really knew what we were doing half the time because we were trying
52:25
to figure it out, we weren’t, we weren’t educated to be producers and I don’t
52:30
think there were a lot, there was a lot of instruction in the universities for that.
52:34
Most of the instruction was like set design or building or performing or
52:40
directing, but the idea that theatre as an administrative activity or
52:46
business activity hadn’t really, I think developed at that time, or not
52:50
developed as extensively as it is now.
52:55
So we were learning a lot of stuff, you know how to do marketing, how
52:59
to manage rehearsals, how to do box office, how to write grants, how to
53:05
maintain financial records, pay people, do contracts, the whole nine yards.
53:10
But
53:14
suddenly I mean people were asking us to produce their projects and we
53:20
were producing our own and at the same time we were constantly having to
53:25
work on side jobs to keep the family together, pay for our house and all
53:32
those kinds of things, raise our kids, and that was the genesis of Milagro.
53:38
At that time we didn’t call it that.
53:40
The first I think six months we had the notion somehow we could
53:44
do it as a private company.
53:46
That quickly evaporated, you know, we realized that we’d never make enough
53:50
money to pay that and we needed to have the 501[c][3], the non-profit status
53:57
to be able to receive donations and grants, so I think I did the paperwork
54:03
for that in the spring of ’85 and then we received official classification as a
54:09
501[c][3] somewhere in September about ’85
54:18
and that, when we did the non-profit we changed the name from what
54:23
it had been and we landed on the Miracle Theatre Group at that time.
54:29
And I tell people we didn’t originally create ourselves
54:31
as a Latino arts organization.
54:34
We were just a bunch of kids trying to stay alive in the theatre and do what
54:38
we did and we really didn’t know what the path was, I’ll be honest with you I
54:44
didn’t, I don’t think it was until I did the nonprofit status that I got serious
54:49
about this being for the long-term, you know, and at that point that still
54:55
didn’t, I still didn’t understand what that meant in terms of commitment,
55:00
in terms of resources, in terms of body of work, all that kind of stuff.
55:06
But that’s when we started asking those questions, and a few years later, we
55:11
determined to follow our roots, and actually that came from a friend of
55:17
ours who was a board member, who was not Latino, I remember one day in the
55:21
meeting he just said, you should be a Latino theatre company, miracle should
55:26
be a Latino theatre company, and I thought that was crazy, but the more
55:29
and more I thought about it, that’s more and more where my heart was.
55:32
And it was very much about getting back to my roots and exploring this territory
55:40
I thought I knew, but honestly every day I’m finding out new things and
55:47
there’s new worlds, I mean it’s amazing.
55:51
So, and then a list…
55:55
So
55:58
we’re approaching the end here.
55:59
I don’t want to take up too much of your time, but I do want to ask—
56:01
—thank you for being conscious of that
56:04
I mean I have a million other questions but
56:06
I’m sure
56:06
But I just, I want to know what does Milagro now, looking back, it’s
56:13
been what almost 35-40 years since…
56:17
Well we’re in our 36th season yeah so yeah
56:20
So what does this mean to the community now to have this
56:23
space as a Latino theatre?
56:26
Well that’s a good question ‘cause I think you know I do think that
56:35
one of the strengths of the organization, if you can contemplate it that way,
56:40
is its adaptability and resilience and
56:47
I think that’s also part of what,
56:51
something that should be fundamental to any creative experience or creative
56:56
inquiry is not having answers, asking questions and looking for paths, looking
57:03
for, and trying things that maybe they fail and trying things that maybe they’re
57:07
successes, so I think we’re still, I still feel that the organization is
57:13
evolving, that everything we’ve done is a basis for moving forward, but there may
57:21
be new things that we need to discover.
57:24
So one of the things I’m trying to push more on is sort of the sense that
57:33
we’re more than just a theatre company, we’re more than just about producing
57:38
plays, we’re also a beacon and a resource for arts, culture, and history.
57:47
And so I think as we look at
57:53
maybe the next stage, is that we are pushing heavier
58:00
to explore what that means in terms of how we connect with community, what kind
58:05
of programming we do, what is, how does the facility support that differing kind
58:13
of activity, what kind of changes or adjustments we make, like this area right
58:18
here was totally designed to basically address that idea in a way, we call it
58:26
the Zocalo and for me that means the center of where things happen, and it is
58:34
inspired so much by the Zocalo in Mexico City where so many different activities,
58:40
you can have political protests, you can have art exhibitions, you can have
58:43
people sitting in the corner drinking a soda, or singing or dancing or nothing
58:50
at all, and I wanted to sort of have that place, where people could congregate
58:55
and do a lot of different stuff.
58:59
And I think this place is fulfilling that idea.
59:02
We have more activity here, now that we can handle it pretty much.
59:07
[Phone
59:13
rings; spam call] yeah but uh so that, I think that’s where we’re going
59:21
and I think that’s also, even though we may form the ideas individually,
59:32
to be complete they need more participation so part of what we’re doing
59:38
is we’ve already outlined a strategic plan that incorporates that thinking
59:48
and now we’re going to deepen that to look
59:55
to see what kinds of actions and goals that we want to reach for in
1:00:02
terms of accomplishing that vision.
1:00:06
Is Milagro the only Latino theatre in Portland or are there others?
1:00:12
I think so, I think it—it depends on how you define only,
1:00:20
I mean I think there was a small company up in Seattle that formed
1:00:26
probably in the last 5 or 10 years that does shows occasionally.
1:00:31
They don’t have their own home, and I don’t think they have what you would
1:00:37
describe as a season, but you know they’re legit in that respect as if
1:00:44
you know, but I think when we look at, the word can be used in different ways,
1:00:50
you can have the, what I unfortunately call, the fly-by nights, you know, which
1:00:58
I kind of love because that describes our early existence, where we could’ve
1:01:03
been here today and gone tomorrow kind of thing, that’s how precarious
1:01:08
the whole thing is, and then you have the more established organizations
1:01:13
that have a lot of years behind them.
1:01:14
They have staff, they have facilities, or at least a track record, so
1:01:20
along that route there’s a lot of, what do you call theatre?
1:01:24
Is it a company that opens up in a garage and does one show or is it the
1:01:28
company that’s been around for forty years and has had, impacted thousands
1:01:33
and thousands of people and stuff.
1:01:36
So I think what we do, I do to be kind of safe is I just talk about us as
1:01:41
being the Northwest premiere Latino arts and cultural organization and
1:01:46
don’t worry about who’s first or second.
1:01:51
Absolutely well I think we’ll leave it there.
1:01:53
Okay.
