00:02
Good day, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State
00:05
University, College of Forestry.
00:08
I am here in the home of
00:12
Dr. Richard Haynes, a forest economist with a 32-year career with the U.S.
00:18
Forest Service, as a research forester, project leader and program manager.
00:22
And he also spent some time as an adjunct faculty at Oregon State University
00:27
and the University of Washington.
00:29
Now, Dr. Haynes has his own private consulting firm in forest
00:37
economics.
00:38
Yes.
00:40
Today we are going to be doing an oral history interview
00:45
funded by the PNW Station.
00:47
This is going to be centered, but not limited to, Dr. Haynes' experience and
00:55
time working on the Northwest Forest Plan.
00:57
We'll be talking about the scope of his whole career, how he sees forestry
01:02
economics within the context of the Northwest, but anything else he feels
01:06
is relevant for this discussion.
01:08
Good afternoon, Richard.
01:10
How are you?
01:11
I am fine.
01:12
Thank you for the opportunity, Sam.
01:14
Yes, I am very much looking forward to this.
01:15
So, we'll start this off like we do with every interview.
01:20
Basically, tell me where were you born and raised, and if you want to add a
01:23
biographical sketch, that would be great.
01:26
I was born in Washington, D.C. and I was raised in northern
01:30
Virginia in a couple of counties.
01:35
I went to high school there.
01:37
I attended Virginia Tech.
01:41
At the time, it was still called Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
01:44
VPI, if I recall.
01:46
Right?
01:46
Yeah,
01:49
VPI.
01:50
We've gone through several name changes trying to get university into it.
01:56
But isn't that still when they used to call themselves the Gobblers?
01:58
Well, they still do, the Fighting Gobblers.
02:01
But now, they're the Hokies?
02:03
[Hokies common use-sports reference]
02:03
Yeah, they were always the Hokies.
02:06
The Hokies was one nickname, and the mascot was the Gobbler.
02:09
I always wondered how there was that split personality there.
02:13
Yeah, wild turkeys are common there, so I suppose, that speaks for that.
02:19
Hokie, if I remember, was sort of an
02:24
1890's slang term.
02:26
It stuck to them, just as the University of Virginia was called the Cavaliers.
02:32
Now, was a Hokie, the people who went to the university?
02:35
Yes.
02:35
Okay, so you were a Hokie?
02:37
Yeah, you were a Hokie, but they didn't really use it very much.
02:42
It's just, we're the Hokies, you know, as a collection.
02:46
I got you.
02:47
When we'd march into a stadium or something, they said, “Here
02:57
are the Hokies.” After getting a B.S. and an M.S., I went on active duty
03:03
for three years, serving in the Army.
03:06
I came back and worked for the Department of Agriculture's Economics Research
03:11
Service [U.S.] almost a year, and went back to graduate school because
03:15
I wanted to get back into forestry and away from being just an agricultural
03:21
economist or general economist.
03:24
Now, what was your childhood like in relation to the natural world?
03:31
I was an avid Boy Scout and belonged to a local troop, that was, in today's terms,
03:41
I think it'd be called high adventure.
03:43
We did a lot of camping and canoeing, my family, and we spent the summers
03:50
until I was about 12 or 13 living on an old family farm where it was one
03:57
of five farms that farmed together.
03:59
I could roam for a mile in any direction with my cousins,
04:03
with our BB guns, observed land
04:10
that had been in the family for 150 years, and how it'd been managed.
04:15
And people could tell you what was there when they were kids, 80 years before.
04:21
You probably could say that your interest in agricultural economics
04:23
was at least somewhat an outgrowth of your environment growing up?
04:29
Yes, and in high school I got interested in conservation for some reason.
04:36
And so that was just an extension of the managing of forests.
04:40
So,
04:45
this would have been in the '50s.
04:47
Correct?
04:47
Yeah, the late '50s.
04:49
That was before the modern environmental age really began.
04:53
Was there a particular event or incident, a friend or a mentor, that
04:59
may have led you in that direction?
05:00
Well, there was a gentleman who lived nearby and worked
05:06
for the [U.S.] Park Service.
05:08
He talked to me several times about
05:14
the Park Service.
05:16
He described the “cannonballs” kind of parks, and the more “natural” parks.
05:21
The military parks?
05:22
[“cannon balls”]
05:23
Yes.
05:23
Of which there are a lot in Virginia.
05:24
Yeah, there are.
05:30
It was more the observing as we hiked.
05:35
We did a lot of the camping in Shenandoah National Park.
05:39
We maintained five miles of the Appalachian Trail outside the park,
05:45
where the Appalachian [Trail ran]
05:47
. The Blue Ridge Mountains.
05:48
Right?
05:48
Right, but north of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
05:51
My family's farm was nestled in a little set of mountains
05:56
called the Bull Run Mountains.
05:59
So, I saw a lot of the natural stuff around me.
06:06
I was impressed, particularly camping in Shenandoah National Park, and
06:12
the transition from that to the private land, where the five miles
06:15
of trails were that we maintained which were between Shenandoah
06:20
National Park and Harper's Ferry.
06:24
All of that now is a national park, a linear national park.
06:27
It wasn't then.
06:28
So, the noncontiguous lands have now been merged together through various methods?
06:35
Yeah, but they just bought a strip.
06:38
I mean, in some places, it's just 100 feet wide, in other
06:42
places, it's blocks of land.
06:44
Was this private donations or was it a Nature Conservancy kind of thing?
06:48
All of the above, everything.
06:49
All of the things put together?
06:50
Right, and its headquarters is in Harper's Ferry now.
06:55
But it's a 2,000-mile linear national park.
07:00
Is there a particular story or incident you remember that was especially
07:07
impactful when you were camping and hiking and doing these things?
07:12
Well, one thing was that near us was the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,
07:18
the canal built along the Potomac.
07:20
In the era before railroads, it was going to link the Ohio Valley
07:25
to tidewater, to the Potomac.
07:30
When I was a teenager, we decided, the Boy Scouts, that we would
07:34
ride the length of the path.
07:36
At the same time, they had just made it a national monument.
07:41
It had just become publicly owned.
07:46
We were among the first groups to ride the whole length of it, because up until
07:52
then, people had seen it only in chunks.
07:53
Some cities had maintained the tow path s [for boats on waterways]
07:56
as a path through their town.
07:59
Other places, the first part of it went right through Georgetown.
08:03
And it was, I think a national park, or national monument, maybe the first
08:08
20 miles, but they extended it to all 184 miles up to Cumberland, Maryland.
08:14
So, I'd watched that process.
08:18
Isn't that one of the routes where “Coxey's Army” marched in the 1890's, that
08:23
big protest movement in the United States?
08:25
Well, probably, because it would have provided--
08:28
Well, it went right to Washington, that's why I'm thinking about that.
08:33
[Coxey’s “Army” took several routes, including the canal pathway.]
08:34
It would have provided a route from the Ohio Valley, once you got over the
08:38
mountains, but it turned out that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad beat them to
08:41
it, so the canal operated, hauling just coal and grain, until the floods of 1924.
08:52
What do you remember about natural resource management dynamics within
08:58
that context, certainly, the Shenandoah area, but more broadly speaking in
09:03
Virginia and home of your youth?
09:05
Things you saw that maybe you didn't understand at the time, but maybe
09:09
made an impression that would be catalogued for later reference
09:14
as you developed professionally?
09:16
Well, Shenandoah National Park, where we did all the hiking, was a
09:22
donation from the State of Virginia to the National Park Service.
09:29
They had bought out farms, there was tax-delinquent land,
09:33
and old timber company lands.
09:35
And so, as I was hiking, I was always observant about how old fields were
09:43
evolving back into forest, and why you had this kind of forest on this slope,
09:48
and that kind of forest on another slope.
09:51
So, even though maybe you didn't understand the science of succession,
09:55
you could see and you were asking the questions about, well, what is
09:58
this and how did this come to be?
10:00
Yeah, and then on the family farms there was the same thing, because
10:04
there you had people who had been born there eighty years before and they
10:09
could say, you know, that used to be a field, and now it was tulip poplar, or
10:15
it took us a long time to figure out how to get the stumps out of
10:21
there, and now we're farming that
10:25
[land] , or you could just see it in the succession of the fields,
10:29
what they did on various fields.
10:30
They were also changing what they were raising.
10:35
Now, up in the high mountains, it was still deciduous forest or did
10:40
you get up into some coniferous up in the high Blue Ridge?
10:44
Well, in the Blue Ridge itself on certain slopes you have what's
10:48
called t able mountain pines and two needle pine, so there'd be big
10:52
stands of that on certain slopes.
10:55
Also, in Shenandoah National Park you had a lot of succession going on, so you'd
10:58
have white pine, if they didn't have much fire, eastern hemlock, those were just
11:04
the natural species, the native species.
11:07
But it was mostly deciduous.
11:09
And then if it, down on the farm land if it was wet, you wouldn't have
11:14
pines, you'd have pin oak and red maple because they could take wetter sites.
11:21
Did they have commercial logging operations?
11:25
Yeah, hard wood.
11:26
Yeah, mostly hard wood.
11:27
I had an uncle, one of my uncles, who had a small sawmill.
11:31
Whenever we needed boards for a barn or something like that, we'd go cut a few
11:35
trees down, roll them on the wagons, haul them up there, and he'd fire
11:39
up the old mill and we'd cut boards.
11:48
When I got to high school, I went to a fairly enlightened high school.
11:52
So, they would accommodate.
11:54
I got interested in conservation and so I wrote my history
11:59
papers on things about that.
12:03
What was the name of your high school?
12:05
Yorktown, Yorktown High School.
12:12
How would you have described the forests and the ecology of Virginia, especially
12:17
as you became more trained later on and had more of a comparative context?
12:23
I went to school where
12:29
we studied dendrology and plant associations, all the way from
12:33
sea level to the Canadian forest.
12:36
VPI was on a plateau about 2,000 feet high, so we could go down into
12:42
the James River Valley and we'd see southern pine forests, you'd see
12:47
the—not the true, coastal forest, but the southern pine, the Piedmont forest.
12:52
True coastal forest would have cypress in
12:59
it.
12:59
That would be the biggest difference.
13:01
Atlantic white-cedar, swamp, with Tupelo, stuff like that, when
13:04
you got down next to the ocean.
13:07
Virginia had a coastal plain, a piedmont, and a mountainous side.
13:11
We could do the lower piedmont up to the Canadian forest, which kind
13:16
of comes down the Appalachians.
13:18
At the very highest elevations, you have firs.
13:23
And so, they taught us largely by plant associations, our
13:28
ecology and dendrology work.
13:32
I was well-trained in that sense.
13:37
And for western species, we'd just walk around town because people planted stuff.
13:41
So, you learned to identify the western species.
13:45
But you have to remember, the Southern Appalachians are much
13:48
more species-diverse than here.
13:55
It's the same thing for my wife, who I told you about before the interview,
13:59
a natural resource economist/forester from Peru, who said about the forest
14:02
up here, there are a lot of trees, but there's not very many species.
14:07
Right, it's not very diverse.
14:09
And the Amazon was her point-of-reference, which is even more diverse, I
14:14
would guess, than the Appalachians.
14:17
Probably.
14:20
How do you think the contrast between your home state and the Pacific Northwest,
14:24
affected your views on managing coniferous forest areas that compose such a large
14:33
percentage of the Pacific Northwest?
14:35
How do you think that contrast would lead to whatever you did
14:41
in your career, which was by then centered here in the Northwest?
14:46
Well, I came here because they paid the most.
14:50
I was a trained forest economist.
14:58
On one hand, I was trained to work for large enterprises in forest
15:05
management and with forest regulations, which is what a forest economist
15:09
did at that time, and marketing.
15:12
I was an agricultural economist, and a large part of that is marketing.
15:19
I came out here because they paid the most and had interesting problems.
15:28
I also knew that in coming here, the forest management was relatively simple.
15:35
It's volume-regulated, or they were trying to volume-regulate their forest,
15:41
which I always thought was a shell game, because I was trained in area regulation.
15:49
So, when I came here, I thought forest management was relatively simple
15:53
compared to what it could have been,
15:58
and straightforward.
15:59
They had species that you could regenerate that responded well to
16:06
stand practices, and produced really valuable timber, tall and straight.
16:15
Now, when you entered the university system, did you
16:17
know what you wanted to study?
16:19
Did you want to be an agricultural economist from the get-go, or did
16:22
that evolve because of a particular relationship with a mentor or
16:26
a class that turned you on?
16:30
I'd taken economics in high school and thought it was an interesting topic.
16:37
And when I
16:40
was at VPI, you had to declare a major before you could go.
16:44
So, there wasn't the chance you go for one or two years and take a
16:47
bunch of classes to figure it out?
16:49
Right?
16:50
The world was different when I grew up.
16:54
That kind of thinking got you drafted.
16:56
In
16:58
other words, you needed to be in a “hard” program to get a deferment?
17:02
Well, VPI required that you declare a major because different schools
17:08
accepted [students] differently.
17:11
Getting in their engineering schools would have been a challenge.
17:15
I knew I wanted to do something in conservation, and forestry
17:19
was the closest thing.
17:22
VPI had the only forestry school in the state.
17:24
I
17:26
had to go to a state school.
17:30
So, who were some of your most important mentors at VPI?
17:37
People that you could cite as, yeah, that was my professor that really got me going,
17:43
I loved that class, or what have you?
17:45
My course advisor was a guy named Emmet Thompson, who was a forest
17:50
economist, and later on, became a dean at Mississippi State [University] . He
17:57
even served as president of SAF [Society of American Foresters] . He was a young
18:03
professor and took an interest in me.
18:06
VPI
18:08
at
18:14
that time was struggling to get accreditation, so they
18:17
had hired really good faculty.
18:21
And
18:24
their forest ecology was taught by
18:34
an English Professor named Sedgewick.
18:36
[See notes]
18:36
Sedgewick?
18:36
Nate Sedgewick.
18:36
He was a professor from England, and he was very thorough.
18:39
We used Stephen Spurr's book, and he made it very interesting.
18:45
The entomologist [at VPI] was exceptional.
18:50
Entomology was one of your capstone
18:55
classes.
18:56
He was really big on teaching professional judgment, not only doing things that
19:03
you know, but rendering a judgment where you were extending what you knew.
19:08
For example, here's a bug, you've got to key it out and identify it, and you can
19:16
find five out of the six little features you're supposed to know [how to weigh
19:20
evidence] . He was the first person that made me think beyond the facts.
19:29
There were also wood technologists.
19:30
Interestingly enough, they were mostly Hungarians, who came from
19:31
the forestry school in Hungary.
19:32
If you know forest history, you know they walked across the border
19:32
during the Hungarian revolution.
19:33
UBC
19:43
[University of British Columbia] took most of them, and as they gained
19:46
English skills, they moved around.
19:47
We [VPI] had several.
19:48
You're talking about when the Soviets invaded Hungary in '56?
19:51
Correct?
19:51
Uh-huh.
19:52
Okay.
19:53
So
19:59
anyway, he was a very thorough wood technologist.
20:02
I
20:05
would guess that, VPI, being that it was an engineering school, the
20:11
technological aspects of it were very central to that whole school?
20:17
It was also the ag [agriculture] school.
20:30
VPI had put together a program, a very rigorous program they made
20:35
you take in thirteen quarters.
20:39
They utilized courses from other schools, rather than teach their own.
20:47
I took surveying with the civil engineers, we took mapping with the ag engineers.
20:53
We had to take a drawing and mapping class, so we took
20:57
it with the ag engineers.
20:58
We were general science majors the first two years, and I took zoology,
21:03
botany, chemistry, physics and geology.
21:06
That's all I did the first two years, as background.
21:14
But we took
21:18
classes like genetics and stuff with the other agricultural sciences students.
21:24
They had a big ag science program, and animal science program.
21:30
It kept you busy for the times you were there.
21:33
And the summer camp.
21:34
We all trooped off to summer camp.
21:37
Because of the military aspect of the school?
21:40
No, did that.
21:40
That was another summer.
21:42
Oh, okay.
21:43
But the forestry [program] had a summer camp.
21:45
We lived out of the back of a truck and visited mills for a couple weeks.
21:51
We visited parks for a couple weeks.
21:54
We lived in a little logging camp for about five or six weeks, where we'd
22:00
cruise timber and conduct a pulpwood sale, logged it, and helped at the sawmill.
22:07
They had a little sawmill there, and we helped.
22:09
Very hands-on, pragmatic training.
22:12
It was, with a very strong, supporting department.
22:16
It was a strong program.
22:22
I benefited from that.
22:23
In hindsight,
22:26
being in such a strong program has benefited me.
22:32
So, you then just continued on there for your masters?
22:35
Correct?
22:37
Yes.
22:37
They made it easy.
22:39
I dual-registered the last term, so I took the hardest graduate class.
22:46
I didn't know it at the time.
22:47
I took the operations research class, their senior operations research class
22:53
for all their industrial engineers.
22:57
And
22:59
the master's program required 36 hours, and it was five hours.
23:04
So, my last term of college wasn't as carefree as some people's.
23:10
I finished up my college classes and I took five graduate hours.
23:14
In hindsight, I wouldn't have done it that way.
23:17
You would have had more fun?
23:20
Yes, I think so.
23:22
Then, that summer, I had to do my military camp.
23:27
So, I went off to Pennsylvania and did the basic training for the ROTC officers.
23:36
How would you characterize your conservation ethic at that time?
23:43
And of course, they weren’t using the term “environmental” yet, as that was a
23:47
'60s and '70s kind of word [reflecting biocentric shift in society] . How
23:49
would you characterize your conservation ethic and perspective at that time?
23:55
And even what was presented and indoctrinated at the school?
24:01
Well, there were two important points.
24:05
One were the observations of the natural forest around you.
24:11
And with the history of those forests,
24:18
we had learned all of our ecology in terms of forest succession or what we saw.
24:24
We saw very little that you would have thought of as old growth.
24:31
We saw old forests, but
24:35
we spent time understanding their origins.
24:38
That
24:41
was one thing.
24:42
The other thing was, in all the classes, we talked about how we were going
24:48
to manage for thrifty young stands.
24:51
There were discussions about how to plant [these young stands]
24:53
, and I was on planning crews.
24:54
I ran planning crews in my spare time, so there were discussions
25:00
about how we're going to plant forests, we're going to grow them.
25:02
We'll harvest them, we'll tend them, and then we'll harvest.
25:04
They taught a stewardship ethic.
25:07
You know that the heart of forestry is
25:11
good stewardship.
25:13
So, they taught that.
25:15
And they practiced that, or emphasized it, I guess.
25:19
The other was the notion that these stands are here today, but what went
25:26
on that led them here and how might they evolve, because we would see
25:31
those stands in different evolutions.
25:34
There was lots of opportunity.
25:36
We had the Jefferson National Forest there, they had just acquired old coal
25:41
mine land, and we fought fires out there.
25:45
I was also on a State of Virginia fire crew, and that was one of the
25:47
things that forestry students do.
25:51
So, this was all around you.
25:54
Fought a fire one time through what turned out to be a quarry
25:57
where they quarried mill stones.
26:00
It was a special type of rock, an aggregate type of rock.
26:04
So, here was this quarry, and the fire revealed this quarry of all these
26:10
millstones still attached to the bedrock.
26:13
They hadn't chipped them out of the rock completely yet.
26:18
They all disappeared within the next couple of months when they were exposed,
26:21
because people came in and hammered them out, hoisted them, to stow them away.
26:30
Using what you're talking about now as a context, what did your early experience
26:36
in Virginia in school and otherwise, prepare you for what you would find
26:41
in the Northwest, and what did it not prepare you for, because of how different
26:45
it would be in certain respects?
26:50
Well,
26:52
we have to skip ahead for some of that.
26:56
I served in the military.
26:58
In the military, I worked on the civil side of the [U.S. Army]
27:02
Corps of Engineers for a while, and
27:08
got to meet a lot of consultants who were doing economic studies.
27:15
This convinced me very quickly that this was an interesting topic.
27:19
Watching these people tackle problems, in this case, there would
27:26
be a brief “deep-draft port” study.
27:28
I've worked on the Mississippi and Ohio systems; replacement of
27:35
a lock and a dam on the Ohio, and Lock and Dam 26 on the Mississippi.
27:43
I became fascinated with the sort of questions they were working
27:46
on, mostly costs and benefits, or how do you justify these costs.
27:53
I worked on a project to build a sea level “Panama Canal,”
27:55
trying to evaluate the costs
27:59
of building such a thing.
28:01
And then, what sort of tariffs do you have to charge to offset that cost?
28:08
You can criticize the Corps for a lot of things, but they do think about that.
28:15
You're talking about the Army Corps, right?
28:16
Yeah.
28:18
I worked on the civil side.
28:19
I was a military officer.
28:22
At the time, they were short on computer-literate people.
28:26
One thing I'd learned in graduate school was how to program.
28:29
I was a very competent Fortran programmer.
28:33
When I went in the military and the Corps figured that out, I ended up
28:40
working on the civil side, essentially doing financial-cost calculations
28:45
for a sea-level canal, and later, for other waterway projects.
28:51
Are you talking about Vietnam?
28:52
No.
28:52
In Vietnam, I got there, and it turned out that they had a little office to try to
29:00
figure out economic impacts, and the Corps of Engineers is where that kind of talent
29:08
lay, so I got assigned to that office.
29:13
Did similar stuff, but the cost of military restrictions, like if you
29:17
don't let people harvest crops.
29:20
I argued that we ought to keep the markets open.
29:23
If those people can sell stuff, you can influence them and that
29:28
increases their livelihood.
29:29
Extensions of the “hearts and minds” philosophy?
29:31
Yeah, right.
29:33
That didn't go so well in Vietnam, but it was still a philosophy.
29:36
It was a philosophy, and I was down there writing campaign plans
29:40
to try to save the market areas.
29:46
And I also did some “people's war” stuff; how do you sustain living units.
29:54
Vietnam had a very frontier-like border between
30:00
Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia.
30:03
There was a large unknown, heavily forested area that I helped
30:07
study to plan defensive campaigns
30:07
A pretty good-sized mountain range that kind of went, the ridge went
30:10
all the way along Laos and Cambodia?
30:13
Yeah.
30:13
And--
30:13
The Ho Chi Min Trail is along that mountainous ridge area.
30:13
Right.
30:17
I worked on sort of campaign planning, just to sustain people
30:25
using some of the people's warfare, some of the Chinese stuff.
30:31
You essentially put the whole units with their families out
30:34
there, these ranger battalions.
30:36
Did you spend much time out in the forest there?
30:39
You likely did some.
30:40
No, not much.
30:42
You couldn't.
30:43
That was no man's land.
30:44
Too dangerous?
30:44
Yeah.
30:44
But I did spend time in the rubber plantations, because we
30:48
were trying to keep them going.
30:51
What did your exposure to a war zone like that do for you?
30:55
How do you think that affected your whole perspective on what you'd end
30:59
up doing once you came back to the states for the rest of your career?
31:02
Well, I can remember telling my wife that I wanted a career that
31:05
didn't involve a lot of hassle, that you could live in one place.
31:12
Because up until then, we'd been moving around.
31:16
I could also see that it was going to involve one more move back to
31:19
school, and I was going to have to go back to school to get back into
31:25
forestry.
31:27
Were you doing your masters by then?
31:29
And in what year did you graduate from
31:32
VPI?
31:32
Well, since I had done that class early, I was done, essentially, in fifteen months.
31:40
I finished in December 1968.
31:42
You know, most master’s programs at VPI had the tradition that you came
31:46
the summer before you started and you helped somebody with their project,
31:51
you went to school for a year, and then you'd do your project that next summer,
31:55
and your master's project, and people who were coming in would help you.
31:59
It was just kind of a passing-the-baton kind of a system?
32:01
Yeah.
32:03
So, my first summer I went through all of the mills; anybody that used lumber
32:10
in the Southeast, I went through their mill because there was a study for
32:15
the Appalachian Regional Commission.
32:17
Some Ph.D. students and I were collecting data.
32:20
So, I went through all the mills, went through furniture plants, flooring plants.
32:24
I've been through every kind of mill.
32:27
Through all the big sawmills.
32:29
We would leave Blacksburg on Sunday evening, show up at some area where
32:34
we were going to go through the mills, and just all week long, go
32:38
through the mills and come home Friday evening, wash your clothes, and get
32:42
ready to go again the next week.
32:43
I did that for two months.
32:45
I lived out of a car.
32:47
But that's the way they treated their graduate students.
32:50
It was a great experience.
32:52
Hey, that's how my graduate studies went.
32:55
I lived out of my car on research trips because my budget was so small.
33:00
Yeah, we
33:03
stayed in hotels, you ate locally, you ate with everybody else.
33:11
It was an interesting time.
33:13
Very few places, would you actually stay in the same hotel
33:17
more than a couple nights.
33:19
When we did that, it was down at the furniture plants.
33:21
We'd go down to Lexington where there are all these furniture mills.
33:24
You'd go to one mill one day, the next mill, the next day.
33:30
I'm going to return to that experience when we get to the Northwest, because
33:35
I'd like to reference what you learned about local businesses and different
33:41
ecological contexts and economic contexts, but also some similarities
33:45
about local communities and economies.
33:48
I'd like to return to that example, maybe at least as a reference point?
33:52
Well, it was an Appalachian Regional Commission and I'll come to that
33:55
because, well, when I went back to school at North Carolina State
34:02
University, I went there because it had the best economics in the South.
34:06
That's the best for agricultural economics [program] in the South.
34:10
So, that's when you end up at Raleigh then, right?
34:11
Yeah.
34:12
North Carolina State University at Raleigh.
34:12
Yeah.
34:12
For the record.
34:12
Yeah, North Carolina State at Raleigh,
34:18
because it had the best ag economics in the South.
34:21
It turns out, they had combined the ag economics and the regular economics
34:25
together; that's what made it so good.
34:28
So, most of the professors were either Harvard-trained or
34:32
University of Chicago-trained.
34:36
Very market-based.
34:36
Kind of like the crème-de-la-crème of market-based economists?
34:42
Yeah.
34:43
It was in the South.
34:44
And the other thing they had, which I didn't know about, and people hadn't told
34:48
me about, it's where SAS [[Statistical Analysis System] was developed.
34:51
It's a statistical [software] package.
34:54
And they had the largest, at the time, they had the largest civilian
35:00
computer in the country, called TUCC [Triangle University Computing Center].
35:03
It was because Duke, UNC [Chapel Hill] and North Carolina State, had gone together
35:09
for one computer [super computer] . They had one that served all three campuses.
35:13
It was so big that IBM built a building there; they had a research facility there.
35:20
It's incredible that our smart phones now have as much computational
35:24
ability as a whole building.
35:26
Probably did.
35:28
But anyway, I didn't realize that.
35:30
But when I got there, that was to my delight.
35:34
And the reason why I say this is that they required me to be a stat minor.
35:39
Economics essentially required all their graduate students to be stat minors,
35:44
unless you had a note from your mother saying you were illiterate or something.
35:50
When you say stat minor, what does that mean?
35:52
Statistics.
35:54
Minor, what do you mean by that?
35:56
It meant that you were going to take three years of their statistics.
35:58
Okay, I got you.
36:00
Oh, “minor.” I'm sorry. I
36:05
was taking a metaphor in the opposite direction, like you
36:07
were “mining” the computer.
36:10
Never mind.
36:10
No, no.
36:11
Stat minor, got you.
36:13
My fault.
36:15
They also had written the textbook.
36:18
Snedegar
36:20
and Cochran, which was a very standard text.
36:24
They were N.C. State professors.
36:27
So, I took a class from one of them.
36:29
I don't remember which one.
36:30
He taught basic stat methods.
36:32
But his stat methods were tied to using a little programming language
36:41
that essentially had you write your own statistical packages.
36:45
And it was very thorough.
36:50
Most people think of stat methods as sort of “cookbook statistics.” Well, this
36:55
was sort of cookbook statistics where you had to mix up all the ingredients.
36:59
They only gave you the barest bones recipes.
37:04
Their statistics was rigorous.
37:06
I took stat theory, and then econometrics.
37:10
I say all of this because when I showed up out here, I was a much better statistician
37:14
than almost all of my research colleagues.
37:18
That leads me either to a question now or later, but I'm curious,
37:22
what do statistics tell you?
37:24
Also, what do they not tell you, in terms of the complexities of humanity, land
37:28
management, ecology and things like that?
37:32
Well, they just give you a way to relate information.
37:35
But probably more important is that they give you a way to
37:37
assess the power of relationships.
37:41
Some are powerful and some aren't, and they help you understand
37:48
that.
37:48
We'll probably come back to this later on, but in essence, it's the
37:53
inferences you can draw and confidence you can place in those inferences.
38:00
Now, you were still in agricultural economics, or were you also
38:04
-- ? I was in forest economics.
38:05
By the time you're at N.C. State, it was forest economics, and you were maybe
38:10
morphing some of the things you'd learned in agricultural economics earlier, but
38:14
you were than becoming a forest economist?
38:17
Yes.
38:18
Essentially, I only took one forestry course, in, I forget what it was.
38:24
It was some variant of forest, either management or something.
38:29
Because by the time I finished at Blacksburg, I had
38:40
taken operations research, which is always a key part of forest economics.
38:44
I had taken the introductory, production economics, and land
38:49
economics types of classes that are characteristic in the field.
38:52
I'd taken advanced forest management, so I learned more
38:56
about feeding southern pulp mills.
39:03
Because that's what they were really training there.
39:04
They were training procurement foresters, just people to run procurement programs.
39:11
So, when I got to N.C. State, there wasn't any forestry left, and I'd
39:15
had as much forestry as they taught.
39:18
So, I took economics and statistics classes.
39:22
And I took
39:27
basic sociology in lieu of a language [curriculum requirements]
39:31
. So, what was different about N.C. State than Virginia Tech in terms of
39:38
the culture and what you were taught, but also the natural environment that
39:42
you were exposed to in North Carolina?
39:45
There were some differences.
39:47
As you go further south [Appalachians] , the mountains get a little bigger.
39:50
Right, we were often, I was out in the Piedmont.
39:52
While I was there Weyerhaeuser
39:57
came in and had these huge clear-cuts, and they were replanting those
40:02
clear-cuts to pine plantations.
40:04
People were sort of scandalized, because up until then, the pine forests were
40:12
mostly natural forests that had come in following the boll weevil in the '20s.
40:18
I mean, they were nice pine forests.
40:20
But Weyerhaeuser came in and cut them down in big blocks, and that scandalized people
40:25
that they would operate on that scale.
40:27
But, I looked at them and said, "You know, this is the scale
40:31
that you're going to operate on."
40:33
It's another economic model.
40:34
Is that how you saw it?
40:35
Yeah.
40:35
I saw that it made perfect economic sense, but other folks [might
40:41
have thought differently] , and we didn't have forest ecologists there
40:47
at that time.
40:48
There was a genetics institute run by a guy named Bruce Zobel,
40:53
and there was a fertilizer co-op.
40:55
They were the bulk of the graduate students.
40:59
Then there was a forest utilization program that had been there for years.
41:03
It was very traditional, it's sort of the OSU of the East.
41:09
It had a big lab where you'd go down and bust up boards all you want, and
41:14
they had an 88,000-acre school forest.
41:17
In other words, the innovative forest product production kind of thing?
41:20
Yeah, they had a little baby pulp mill at the end of one of the buildings
41:24
they'd fire up every Friday afternoon for pulp lab, and they'd make paper.
41:29
You know,
41:31
they turned out very sophisticated folks, and they had a long history
41:37
of turning out land managers.
41:39
VPI was the come-lately school.
41:41
When I was there, they were always struggling to get accreditation and
41:49
they had a dean for years, a guy named John Hosner, who achieved what he set
41:54
out to do, but it took his whole career.
41:57
VPI, actually, Virginia Tech as they call it now, is pretty
42:01
respected in forestry now.
42:02
It is.
42:03
It's come quite a ways.
42:05
The fact the acting, well, I'm not sure he's still acting, but the Acting Dean
42:09
[College of Forestry] at OSU, Jim Johnson.
42:10
Do you know Jim?
42:13
No.
42:13
He went to Virginia Tech or came from Virginia Tech.
42:18
But N.C. State was an old forestry school, and Duke was right next-door.
42:25
When I was in graduate school, they were trying to wipe out the Duke School
42:28
of Forestry because they wanted to use the school, sell the school forest off.
42:33
It bounded the west side.
42:35
[Duke campus/town-Durham, N.C.]
42:36
. Because they did have that, the big Duke Forest right there.
42:38
It's kind of a famous private forest.
42:40
Right next to the campus west of
42:46
Durham.
42:47
But,
42:51
it was an interesting place.
42:52
It was an interesting time.
42:53
They're very different schools.
42:54
You were at N.C. State when David Thompson played basketball, weren't you?
42:59
Yep.
42:59
And Tom Burleson and the whole team that won the championship.
43:02
Right?
43:03
Yeah.
43:04
Sorry to segue, I just realized that you were there during those years.
43:10
Yeah, I was there.
43:11
We became, and my wife is still an avid ACC basketball fan.
43:16
When we went there, people said, "Well, you know, basketball's
43:19
really popular here." Of course,
43:23
I just sort of looked at the lady that was telling us that, thinking,
43:26
"Well, golly, what's so big about that?" Well, she was right.
43:30
You could lay down in the middle of the main street during a basketball
43:33
game and you wouldn't be run over.
43:39
We'd go to some of the games but they were so loud and noisy, it
43:42
was better to watch them on TV.
43:43
The stadium they had was one of the old original, big stadiums, but it had
43:50
real flat seats, and my wife's only five-feet tall, so she couldn't see
43:55
anything because everybody was standing up yelling, jumping up and down.
43:59
It's better to watch them on TV, but, yeah, they're spectacular games to watch.
44:04
I know, and it's funny though, because everybody often thinks of “Tobacco
44:08
Road” basketball only in context of Duke versus North Carolina, but North
44:13
Carolina State is right there, too.
44:15
Yeah, and then you had Wake Forest, which is right there, also.
44:21
The Demon Deacons.
44:22
Yeah, and it was exciting to watch.
44:25
Football there was just a joke.
44:27
It was sort of entertainment.
44:29
Anybody could go into a football game.
44:31
They didn't have much of a stadium, a little bit of a stadium, but it
44:31
had the big grassy, curved bank, and
44:37
the students all sat on those grassy, curbed banks.
44:40
By the end of the day, all the drunks had rolled down to the bottom of the hill.
44:46
But it was just the thing, a nice afternoon in the Fall, you go out,
44:50
take a picnic, and watch football.
44:53
You're just waiting for basketball to start.
44:56
Of course, the fun little bit of trivia about the Rose Bowl
45:00
and Oregon State and Duke.
45:01
Do you know the story?
45:03
The only Rose Bowl to not be played in Pasadena.
45:06
No.
45:06
In 1942, it was played at Duke Stadium because of the war and they
45:11
were afraid to have a big game in California with the Japanese threat.
45:15
So, the actual Oregon State played Duke at Duke Stadium in the Rose Bowl.
45:20
Yeah.
45:20
I think Duke had more of a stadium than N.C. State did at the time.
45:24
Anyway, back to business here.
45:28
You're at N.C. State and you're learning what you're learning.
45:31
Did you have a specific mentor or a class or a book or a philosophy, that took you
45:41
to the next level, really energized you?
45:46
No, I wouldn't have been there if I wasn't energized because, remember, I
45:51
had worked beforehand, so I knew what I was giving up by going back to school.
45:58
My committee was surprised when, the first time we met, I said I've
46:02
got to be finished in three years.
46:05
Because you wanted to get out and do your career?
46:06
Yeah, and I already had a master's degree.
46:08
Right.
46:09
I wanted to get on with life, you know, as I'd already put off getting on with life.
46:12
I'd been in the Army, I worked at the Economics Research Service.
46:15
I was anxious to get on with it.
46:18
What was your dissertation subject?
46:20
It was a
46:23
“spatial equilibrium model” for the U.S. forest sector.
46:30
One of my committee members was a very renowned gentleman, actually, part of two
46:36
brothers who were renowned agricultural economists, both Harvard-trained,
46:41
back when Harvard trained agricultural economists, a guy named Richard King.
46:46
He had just reviewed a paper where some people had solved a long-term
46:52
problem about spatial pricing, and he suggested that I apply that to
46:58
forestry because he thought that
47:03
it might work similarly for
47:08
forestry.
47:08
It's called site prices.
47:09
The spatial issue in agriculture is, you've got, say, a farm
47:11
here and a farm here, and you have the processing center here.
47:16
How do you figure out what price they should offer the farmer, this
47:19
farmer as opposed to that farmer.
47:22
In the 1840's, a German
47:29
agricultural economist named Von Thunen had solved that problem by
47:34
making little concentric circles that represented transportation costs.
47:40
And so, do you want to check that?
47:46
The transportation costs might be egg-shaped.
47:49
It would be a perfect shape if everything had equal transportation
47:53
costs, but it doesn't, and so, you have these, sort of egg-shaped zones
47:59
[equal transportation costs] . In equilibrium, this is another point,
48:03
later we'll get to this in a discussion of this, but in economics, a price
48:09
only exists in a single point-in-time.
48:11
So, the price of gas, today's price of gas, would exist here, and if it
48:16
went over here to another point, this price has to be similar to that price,
48:22
only different by the transportation cost because you would go over there.
48:26
If it's cheaper, you'd go over there, but the cost of going over
48:30
there offsets that difference.
48:31
Which is why I fill up in Corvallis, because it's cheaper
48:35
in Corvallis than Eugene.
48:37
And I work in Corvallis and live in Eugene.
48:39
I learned that over the last four years.
48:42
Right.
48:42
You've discovered how price arbitrage works.
48:44
Exactly what you're talking
48:48
about.
48:49
In agricultural economics, this is a big deal because you're trying to figure
48:53
out potential farm income as one of your main policy variables, as you're
48:58
trying to figure out how to price stuff at the “farm gate,” as it's called.
49:04
In forestry, we knew there were different markets that had always been observed.
49:08
You had a market for Southern pine, you had a market for,
49:14
say, Douglas-fir.
49:15
But we didn't understand how markets were arbitraging into each other.
49:21
This provided an explanation for that.
49:23
You take a single price for lumber, and it decomposes into the price in
49:27
the various markets, and they sort of float in relationship to each other.
49:34
So, he proposed that for my dissertation.
49:36
Is that because most studies were still done kind of at a regional level?
49:40
Oh, very much.
49:42
As forestry and the intellectual environment in the United States
49:46
evolved over the 20th century, the comparative reference points became
49:51
sophisticated enough, you were able to come up with these more
49:55
mature theories and philosophies?
49:58
Right?
49:59
Yes.
50:00
In forestry, the question had been described by people at the University
50:06
of California, called Vox, named after Vox and Zenuska, both forest economists.
50:12
They had proposed this, but there was no way to solve it.
50:15
It was not solvable.
50:19
Richard King had reviewed this article by two gentlemen, Deloy and Norton,
50:24
who had solved the problem partially, for some agricultural commodities.
50:30
He asked if I could do it for forestry.
50:32
So, I got involved in forestry.
50:36
For me, it was more complicated as we had more products.
50:39
Because in the end, what you're really trying to determine is
50:42
stumpage price differences.
50:46
They're a function of various products.
50:47
So, I had eleven products.
50:50
And I got the model together, and
50:57
it was so big that I could only run it at night [on computer] . By this time,
51:02
our daughter had been born, I'd put her to bed, and I'd go to a computer center.
51:09
Your model, because of the computational limitations of that time, you
51:14
didn't have enough space except when nobody was on the computer?
51:18
Right.
51:18
Okay.
51:19
And before they'd do the administrative stuff, they'd let, there were a couple
51:22
people like myself, who had big models.
51:25
And I got it actually solved and it went out a couple decades because
51:32
forestry is a 50-year proposition, you'd have to have some period of time.
51:38
Because of the products and the regeneration dynamic and it's
51:43
horizon.
51:44
It is
51:48
a long horizon.
51:49
It's a long horizon.
51:50
So, I demonstrated that you could basically get the model to work, that
51:54
it worked as originally specified, that it gave you some interesting
51:59
results, it wasn't very useable,
52:04
but it got me a dissertation.
52:09
I sort of squeaked out.
52:15
I'd become aware of the sort of contemporary forestry problems,
52:22
because the prelim system at N.C. State was a proposition system.
52:28
One of the propositions I was asked to write.
52:31
You had some assigned to you, some you chose.
52:33
And there were four you had to write, and I could choose one, and I had
52:40
to do my dissertation proposal, and there were two that were assigned.
52:44
One that was assigned, was to develop a senior-level forest economics class.
52:51
In hindsight now, I realize that was my major professor.
52:54
I thought he was just preparing me, because most jobs were teaching jobs.
52:58
He thought he was being clever, preparing me.
53:03
I had to read all the contemporary literature and threads of the
53:11
main kinds of topics that were current, and that's where I read
53:15
about some of the western issues.
53:16
So, I knew about the Redwood Park issue.
53:19
Actually, I'd learned about the Redwood Park issue because
53:26
the son of the chair of Berkeley's Forestry [Dept.] was
53:31
a VPI teacher on my committee.
53:34
When his father, Kent Davis, the guy who
53:37
wrote the forest management text, came to visit he would give talks about
53:42
contemporary sort of western issues.
53:44
And one of the talks he gave was the Redwood Park issue [on
53:48
mix of state and federal lands]
53:48
. You're talking about when they decided to expand the original park [F.] and
53:53
the controversy about how they were going to incorporate these other
53:57
lands before they got logged off too?
53:59
Correct?
53:59
Yes.
54:00
And important to the Northwest Forest Plan, it was the first time they tried a
54:06
jobs mitigation type plan, a restoration.
54:10
We'll take away timber harvests and we'll have mitigation jobs.
54:13
[Restoration, or “green sector” employment] This was
54:14
the first attempt at that.
54:17
They were trying to lessen the impact on the local economies?
54:20
Uh-huh.
54:21
Now, was there a mixture between Indian and non-Indian lands?
54:26
Wasn't there some involvement with Indian lands around there?
54:29
Not so much early on.
54:31
It was mostly taking Forest Service land.
54:34
The Indian tribes that you're talking about are probably the Yuroks?
54:38
And there's the Hoopas and a couple different ones in there, but, yeah.
54:42
Yeah, they may have in later adjustments, played a large role in
54:48
making sure that their traditional products would be available.
54:51
But in the original controversy, it was a matter of, we're going to take timber
54:55
out of production, the highly productive timber lands, out of production.
55:01
Now, you were telling me about how you were exposed to these ideas.
55:05
When was the first time you actually traveled to the West
55:08
and saw the big timber of the West, whether it be Redwoods or
55:12
-- ? I came out for an interview.
55:14
So, it was the '70s then?
55:15
Yeah, as a teenager, I'd gone to Philmont Scout Ranch, and so, I'd
55:21
seen the Southwest, seen the aspens, saw the elevation differences.
55:28
But you know, that's like “Islands in the Sky” stuff [SW
55:31
mountains rising from deserts]
55:31
Right, you're talking about Arizona or New Mexico?
55:34
New Mexico, up in the corner of New Mexico.
55:36
But
55:39
people didn't travel as much when I was a kid, back-and-forth
55:43
to Florida kind of stuff.
55:48
I may have asked a version of this question earlier.
55:52
Your experience in the East as a student and young professional, but mostly as a
55:57
student, what did that prepare you for in the West, and what did it not prepare
56:02
you for, in terms of scale, scope, and certainly the diversity dynamic
56:06
in that species were much different?
56:09
What did you have to learn when you got here?
56:21
Well, I had to learn to deal with people who were not very statistically
56:29
sophisticated.
56:29
I had to deal with people who were not modelers.
56:34
Without realizing it, I was really good at large-scale models.
56:38
And so, I came here and worked with scientists who—I worked with one scientist
56:46
who took a picture every couple of years.
56:48
He would compare the pictures.
56:50
So, it was kind of anecdotal, impressionistic, not statistically-driven?
56:55
Right.
56:55
And they weren't smart enough to know that the plural of anecdotes is data.
57:03
It was observational, personal observations.
57:10
Not statistically-sophisticated was the science community I worked with.
57:16
Klutzy
57:20
with computers.
57:24
They had a view of silviculture which I thought was overly simplistic.
57:29
How so?
57:31
Well, they had the 80-year rotation, 80-year stand management thing,
57:36
pretty much etched in their minds.
57:38
They weren't very flexible about that.
57:39
In other words, they thought of one-size-fits-all kind of applications.
57:42
Yeah.
57:45
I always thought volume regulation was something you saw in county
57:49
fairs, you know, some hucksters trying to sell you something.
57:54
I mean, in terms of the volume was everything that mattered and
57:58
then there was the get-out-the-cut kind of mentality that you saw?
58:00
Well, it was how you regulated your forest.
58:02
They regulated them on volume regulation, rather than area regulation.
58:07
And so, it's subject to a lot of tricks.
58:09
If you can grow your trees a little faster, it means you
58:11
can cut a little more volume.
58:14
You use a different yield function, you get more
58:21
volume.
58:21
It was just sort of this simplistic view.
58:25
Now, you interviewed out here in '75?
58:29
Correct?
58:30
In the spring of '75, during spring break of 1975.
58:34
I was finishing that summer.
58:36
At N.C. State?
58:37
. At N.C. State.
58:38
I had applied all over for university jobs.
58:42
Had two standing offers from places I had worked for in Washington, D.C. I could go
58:47
back and work for the Corps of Engineers.
58:49
I could go back and work for Economics Research Services.
58:51
Both offered me return positions.
58:56
So, what made you want to come out here?
58:58
They offered you what?
59:00
Money.
59:01
It was more money?
59:02
It was more money.
59:03
The University of Kentucky was interested in hiring, but when I told them what the
59:10
salary was here, they couldn't match it.
59:13
And my wife didn't like the university environment.
59:19
There was something about it that she just didn't think would be very suitable.
59:28
So, you interviewed out here in Portland, you were hired,
59:32
and you came out here in '75?
59:34
Your first position was as a what?
59:36
Research Forester, GS-12 Research Forester.
59:41
I was hired and got here on August 25, 1975, for reporting.
59:47
I was hired
59:50
to work with international trade issues, log-export controversies, specifically.
59:55
The first question they gave me was a little list of topics.
59:59
One they couldn't find anybody to work on was the price impacts
1:00:04
of log export restrictions.
1:00:07
I looked at that and
1:00:10
figured out, well, I know how to do price impact stuff.
1:00:14
We did that in agriculture all the time.
1:00:17
I figured that out much to their surprise, quickly.
1:00:22
What percentage were they exporting at that time, approximately?
1:00:28
Probably twenty percent or so, mostly from the State of Washington.
1:00:32
But not so much Oregon?
1:00:34
No, but Oregon shares the ports and this corner of Oregon.
1:00:40
Was that because of the multiple port access points that are in
1:00:45
the Puget Sound area and the--
1:00:46
And the Columbia.
1:00:46
And the Columbia.
1:00:47
Right, I figured that.
1:00:50
You got log exports out of Astoria, Longview, even Portland, at that time.
1:00:58
You could go down right on the main docks in Portland and watch them load logs.
1:01:03
Now, what was the gist of the controversy?
1:01:07
Total log exports?
1:01:09
Well, mostly it was jobs.
1:01:11
You know, if you export a log to Japan, you--
1:01:16
You lose a sawmill job here?
1:01:17
You lose the sawmill job.
1:01:20
At that time, there were about eleven jobs per million board feet.
1:01:23
If you export the log, you lost around five to six jobs.
1:01:28
But you gained a stevedoring job.
1:01:30
That
1:01:33
was the crux of it.
1:01:34
The other part was that you drive up prices for everybody else, because
1:01:39
you're shifting the supply curve back.
1:01:41
That's what I did in the price impact thing.
1:01:43
Because of the beginning of globalization in the Northwest in terms
1:01:46
of its major extractive industries.
1:01:50
Yeah, it was, but we'd been a log exporter.
1:01:54
This region had always exported some logs.
1:01:56
They really took off after the Columbus Day storm.
1:01:59
Because of all the salvage logging afterwards?
1:02:00
[high winds-blow-down]
1:02:00
Yeah, all the salvage logging.
1:02:02
And at the same time, the Japanese economic recovery [Post-WWII] had
1:02:07
gotten to the point where they needed [building materials] . The Japanese
1:02:10
liked the white woods for their post-and-beam construction system.
1:02:16
They're one of the few places that builds wooden houses,
1:02:18
so they would take our logs.
1:02:22
We'd saw them and
1:02:26
use them in construction.
1:02:28
They
1:02:34
went through the big mill in Portland at what's called Vanport, because it
1:02:41
was just on the other side of the 205.
1:02:42
[Hwy.
1:02:42
in east Portland] You can see the remnants of it now.
1:02:44
Yeah, I still see that name around sometimes, Vanport.
1:02:49
You'd go through there, and they'd be stacking up cants out
1:02:52
of old growth over on the side.
1:02:54
When they got a load, they'd export those to Europe where
1:02:58
they'd be re-sawn for furniture.
1:03:00
Exports were always a part of this.
1:03:03
Now, very early exports from the Northwest were to California because
1:03:10
of the San Francisco boom and everything that happened in California.
1:03:13
And San Diego.
1:03:15
San Diego.
1:03:16
When did it shift into the international realm?
1:03:20
Was there much before World War II?
1:03:22
There was always some.
1:03:24
Okay.
1:03:28
But not to the extent.
1:03:30
It really took off after 1962.
1:03:32
The modern controversy took off after 1962, because up until then
1:03:37
it was just part of the product mix,
1:03:43
export clears or stuff, and you still see those names.
1:03:48
Now, I'm going to get to the specific questions here that
1:03:51
I worked up here recently.
1:03:52
In broad terms, how would you describe the forest economy of the Pacific Northwest
1:03:58
in the immediate post-World War II era?
1:04:01
When I'm describing that, I mean the first two to three decades?
1:04:07
You weren't here initially, but you certainly studied it
1:04:10
and became an expert on it.
1:04:12
Well, you have to remember that the forest products industry here
1:04:15
has been big since the 1920s.
1:04:19
It was large before then, but a lot of that involved taking logs down
1:04:24
[rivers/ocean] . That's where the Benson log rafts, those kinds of things, and
1:04:28
they went down to Los Angeles, some to San Francisco, and some to San Diego.
1:04:34
There's also a lot of private land logging that happened early, too.
1:04:37
Right?
1:04:38
Yes.
1:04:38
Now, there's an interesting point about that from a historical standpoint.
1:04:43
You should go look at the oral history interview with
1:04:49
David
1:04:51
Mason,
1:04:56
the advocate who led us to the Sustained Yield Act of 1944.
1:05:00
He argued in the
1:05:03
1930s -- you'll see this imbedded in the O&C Act and it's in the
1:05:08
Elliott Forest controversy -- that we should adopt sustained forestry
1:05:13
because that limits the ups and downs.
1:05:17
It should give us more stable prices, and those stable prices will be the
1:05:21
incentive for improved forest management.
1:05:24
He especially argued to restrict national forest harvest to sustained yield flows,
1:05:31
so that that would offer an incentive for better management on private lands.
1:05:39
So, the sustained yield discussions had a price component in
1:05:46
it, and to maintain communities.
1:05:49
In the O&C Act, it's the only federal forestry acts that says
1:05:53
you've got to sustain communities.
1:05:57
Would you call that a mitigation measure also?
1:06:00
No, that was the promise of sustained-yield forestry.
1:06:04
It's not a mitigation measure, it's a promise.
1:06:11
Okay.
1:06:11
The industry here has been big.
1:06:12
We've had industrial-sized mills, the biggest mills in the world have
1:06:15
been here since the '20s, powered by modern means, by electricity, most of
1:06:24
them, steam generation made electric.
1:06:26
One of the earliest was out in Vernonia.
1:06:29
It's not there anymore.
1:06:32
Vernonia?
1:06:32
Oh, yeah, right up there.
1:06:34
[NW corner of Oregon]
1:06:35
Up there.
1:06:37
So, the industry had been big.
1:06:38
It operated with railroads, and before the Jones Act, with coastal shipping.
1:06:44
Once the Jones Act passed , you really couldn't ship by water
1:06:48
around to the East Coast any more, but you could do it by rail.
1:06:51
Until they deregulated the railroad lines, you had blanket rates, so that
1:06:57
it was cheaper to ship the lumber east.
1:07:02
It wasn't as expensive, say, on a ton-mile basis, because you had
1:07:07
these blanket rates in certain areas.
1:07:11
Then they'd bring different manufactured goods back, so you
1:07:14
were taking wheat and lumber east.
1:07:20
Most of the private land had been cut up before World War II.
1:07:24
All these trees around here, this area was probably cut just prior to World War II.
1:07:29
What you see here is the regrowth [in years after World War II]
1:07:32
. It looks like there's about 50, 60, 70 years [regrowth] , maybe?
1:07:35
There's a park up right here [West Portland suburb] , and
1:07:37
you can see that it's old second-growth, by today's standards.
1:07:43
It needs to be thinned, but the park district won't do that.
1:07:51
After World War II, there was a report, the McKenzie Report, which suggested
1:07:57
that the Forest Service increase its harvest because they could perceive it
1:08:04
was going to decline on private lands.
1:08:10
Even when I got here, there was a lot of controversy about how
1:08:13
you're going to fill in the gap.
1:08:14
There's this perceived notion of a gap coming.
1:08:18
There as a thing called the Beuter Report, which talked
1:08:20
about how to deal with the gap.
1:08:22
People perceived that, and they were trying to come up with a
1:08:26
policy that would transition its way through the gap to where you'd cut
1:08:31
federal lands heavily, say, and then these private lands would regrow.
1:08:37
Of course, that all assumes everybody was going to behave in sort of a
1:08:40
“good forestry” sense; you know, that the industry folks will stop
1:08:44
cutting their lands as heavily and rely on more public timber.
1:08:49
And harvest here increased until 1964.
1:08:52
Harvest increased rapidly following World War II because the U.S. was
1:08:56
trying to house the returning veterans.
1:08:59
The whole Cold War dynamic was a furious time of economic growth in the
1:09:05
extractive industries, and not just in forestry, but in other areas, too.
1:09:10
Right, and there were strategic materials studies.
1:09:14
Timber was not on the high end of that list, but down in
1:09:17
the bottom end of the list.
1:09:18
People were still talking about
1:09:22
it from a strategical sense, how you treat timber.
1:09:27
And so, when I got there, there was this controversy about this transition from old
1:09:35
growth to the second growth, and people
1:09:39
had different visions for that.
1:09:41
As an economist, my vision was, well, it's not going to be a smooth transition.
1:09:50
We could have a “last tree party,” the last big log off the industry land's
1:09:54
going to go down, and people will shut it down until they'll reduce their
1:10:01
production to match what's available from more moderately-managed public lands.
1:10:09
When I got here, forest planning for the public lands was
1:10:17
just getting ready to start, and people were still doing sort of ad hoc volume
1:10:22
regulation models by timber-sheds or working zones sort of planning.
1:10:28
But I got here before forest planning started.
1:10:32
The 1976 National Forest Management Act changed planning,
1:10:35
made it more sophisticated.
1:10:37
Right.
1:10:37
More multi-faceted.
1:10:38
Yeah, more formal.
1:10:40
Right.
1:10:40
And it meant to make it more of a multi-resource [situation] because we'd
1:10:44
had that Multiple Resource Act that passed, so we were supposed to be
1:10:50
thinking more in a multiple-resource context rather than just timber.
1:10:55
Well, I mean, that's when they included recreation and all the other values.
1:10:59
Recreation, range, minerals, timber, and wildlife; five of them.
1:11:04
And that really wasn't included in any meaningful sense before.
1:11:10
No.
1:11:10
People talked about it and there were elements in the Forest Service
1:11:13
and other agencies that saw that as important, but it wasn't official policy.
1:11:19
Right.
1:11:19
It wasn't given equal status, because in the workings of plans, they were
1:11:23
often on timber, how we're going to cut timber, where we are going
1:11:27
to focus management activities
1:11:32
-- because they're harvesting old natural stands.
1:11:36
When I showed up out here, I thought, we're twenty years behind where they were
1:11:42
in the South, because they were already seeing what planted stands looked like
1:11:47
they had started planning in the '60s.
1:11:53
They were cutting through the natural, the old boll weevil pine stands,
1:11:57
and now, were replanting and seeing what they looked like, and starting
1:12:04
to worry about whether, did you bed the stands to just let the pines up.
1:12:12
A lot of the South is wet, or has wet seasons.
1:12:17
They were sort of into the next round of questions.
1:12:21
We've got all these stands; how do we manage them and how do we start to monitor
1:12:30
our planting actions and our stand site prep?
1:12:32
Well, the dynamics of scarcity will force you to look at things differently.
1:12:37
Yeah.
1:12:38
Out here the mythology of a boundless timber horizon was still very influential
1:12:47
when you got out here, to some degree.
1:12:50
Correct?
1:12:50
Among the older people.
1:12:52
But since the national forest cut hadn't gone up any since the early
1:12:55
or mid-'60s, within the agency, they didn't see it as boundless.
1:13:02
They saw the other people looking in wanting our timber,
1:13:06
wanting us to put up more.
1:13:07
And so, there's this tug-of-war between the stewardship traditions the Forest
1:13:12
Service had because a lot of the forest hadn't really cut very heavily.
1:13:20
Even when I showed up in 1975, some of them had just increased their
1:13:24
harvest in just within the last decade.
1:13:27
There were still people concerned, left over from when it was more of a
1:13:34
conservation ethic, when you actually got talking to people in the forest.
1:13:39
Coming in as a newbie who was very trained in economics and what you did, but in a
1:13:45
new environment, new politics, and new ecologies, did you see the scenario as
1:13:53
sustainable, economically or politically?
1:13:57
Yes.
1:13:58
I saw it as sustainable, but it was facing this big gap.
1:14:04
And the more you got to thinking about how will that gap work, you
1:14:09
realized that there was no way around
1:14:14
some big drop-off.
1:14:15
All the economic forces suggest that you adjust to a gap like that, not
1:14:21
by slowing stuff down ahead of time, you run full-tilt until you run out.
1:14:27
Then you fall off.
1:14:29
And you readjust.
1:14:31
So,
1:14:36
I was different from many of my colleagues in that sense, because they were trying
1:14:42
to find a way to transition through that.
1:14:46
I looked at it from a straight economic view, which is that
1:14:48
economics is relentless.
1:14:51
And
1:14:56
there's no “hand of God” going to lead you through this sort of a smooth transition.
1:15:01
That's not the way.
1:15:02
Economic transitions don't work that way.
1:15:06
The numbers are there or they're not.
1:15:08
Yeah.
1:15:09
The log truck shows up in the morning or it doesn't, or
1:15:13
you cut down through the log deck.
1:15:16
And there was enough history of that all around.
1:15:18
Forestry has a history of that.
1:15:19
We cut the lake states
1:15:22
out.
1:15:23
We cut the South out two times.
1:15:24
We’ve been through New England.
1:15:26
A
1:15:28
lot of conservation philosophy and forestry schools arose in response
1:15:35
to concerns, outrage, over some of those things, like the cut-and-run
1:15:41
logging in the upper Midwest, the railroad logging and things like that.
1:15:47
Then, German foresters and French foresters and people [including Americans]
1:15:50
started going back-and-forth, and those ideas started to transfer over here.
1:15:54
Yeah, I was familiar with that.
1:15:57
I'd seen the southern Appalachians cut out, and seen what came back.
1:16:04
It's part of
1:16:09
my education, and I recall walking up old railroad grades with
1:16:15
an ecology professor trying to get us to explain why is this hillside
1:16:20
different than that hillside.
1:16:24
I'd
1:16:27
been through all the mills, talked to a lot of the old duffers who remember
1:16:31
what materials used to be, like how come all our yellow poplars are white now?
1:16:35
We don't have any more yellow poplar.
1:16:42
In the '70s and leading into the '80s,
1:16:48
did you see what was happening in terms of the culture and the politics
1:16:54
and the economics, to all the things that would lead up to the Forest Wars?
1:16:58
Oh, yeah.
1:17:02
How did you see that, and what did you think was going to
1:17:05
happen when you saw it unfolding?
1:17:07
I don't think a lot of people really were prepared for how it would actually
1:17:12
go, even to up until the present day.
1:17:15
Well,
1:17:18
first off, I observed the early projections; they were
1:17:27
non-economic projections.
1:17:28
There was a thing called the “Two Projection” study.
1:17:30
Then there was the Beuter Report.
1:17:33
I was involved in a thing called the Timber Harvest Issue study,
1:17:37
where we developed some of the spatial models I had learned about.
1:17:43
And I worked with Darius Adams [OSU forest economics professor]
1:17:47
on supply and demand estimations.
1:17:50
We combined the two and began to see how changes in one region would affect
1:17:56
another region, and started to look at timber supply more in the economic sense,
1:18:01
not in this sort of mechanistic what's available sense, but an economic sense.
1:18:10
When you looked at it that way, you realized that the whole thing about the
1:18:15
gap in the Timber Wars, was about how are you going to fill in this fall-off
1:18:19
from the private lands, and can you substitute enough public timber to
1:18:26
fill that in until private lands can sustain the current level of harvest.
1:18:31
Say it's six billion feet a year on the west side [Cascades crest to Pacific
1:18:35
Ocean] , six billion cubic feet.
1:18:41
We looked at that and said that's not good economic sense.
1:18:45
You're going to go from six billion and decline down to four, because that
1:18:49
four is going to be made up of public supply and a reduced private supply.
1:18:54
The issue then is, how fast is this transition?
1:18:58
The transition, you're dropping one-third of your harvest, means a
1:19:03
bunch of mills are going to close.
1:19:05
We could tell that story.
1:19:08
So, people kept saying, well, no, let's have departures
1:19:12
from non-declining even flow.
1:19:14
You know, if, in 1973, the Forest Service adopted a non-declining even
1:19:19
flow policy, and the industry wanted to argue, let's have departures
1:19:23
from non-declining even flow.
1:19:25
So, for several decades, we'll raise the harvest up.
1:19:30
We'll increase the national forest harvest, say, from two billion feet to
1:19:33
four billion feet, to fill in that gap.
1:19:36
And there was a lot of politics involved.
1:19:39
I was observant of all of that, and a participant in offering one view.
1:19:46
It wasn't a very persuasive view, but it was one view that irritated people,
1:19:52
because we'd point out to them that, well, your view makes no economic sense;
1:19:58
it doesn't take into account costs.
1:20:00
It's just this mechanistic sort of thing saying if you've got so much
1:20:06
timber available, that it's available.
1:20:08
It's available at a price.
1:20:12
So there was an educational component.
1:20:14
There were fast-thinkers in the industry who knew what we were saying, and knew the
1:20:21
power of that, and knew what to expect.
1:20:26
The Forest Service was being buffetted about.
1:20:31
Foresters don't listen to their economists a whole lot anyway, and
1:20:36
they didn't want to increase their harvest, in spite of having an assistant
1:20:40
secretary, a guy named John Crowell, during the Reagan years [Undersecretary
1:20:42
of Agriculture for Resources and Environment] , who said you ought to.
1:20:48
We didn't talk to the communities a lot.
1:20:50
The 1976 [Forest Management] Act required us to identify timber-dependent
1:20:56
communities, timber-based communities, but that was done by the forest planners.
1:21:02
Not the upper-level managers?
1:21:07
They set some standards and turned it over to the forest planners.
1:21:10
And remember, planning was done on each forest, so
1:21:15
I think there was a regional guide that listed the communities.
1:21:18
Why do you think it was so?
1:21:20
I have my own ideas, but why do you think it was so difficult for the
1:21:23
forest plans, post-1976 act, to be done, implemented, and accepted?
1:21:29
Because if I recall, most of the forests either didn't have plans or
1:21:35
they struggled to get them together for many different reasons, in the
1:21:38
years leading up to the Dwyer Decision and the spotted owl controversy, and
1:21:43
the Northwest Forest Plan dynamics?
1:21:45
I'll tell you a little bit of history you're probably not
1:21:48
going to hear from anybody else.
1:21:52
The reason each of the forests in the region were struggling, especially
1:21:56
on the west side, because all their plans involved a drop in harvest.
1:22:02
Essentially, when they first did the plans, they sort of
1:22:06
kept harvest at where it was.
1:22:08
But then, they kept layering on.
1:22:11
Well, they didn't treat wildlife very well, so they'd have to tighten
1:22:15
down some assumptions, or you didn't do this or you didn't do that.
1:22:20
As they did that, it would drop the harvest on all the national forests.
1:22:26
On the national forests, the industry said, "Oh, we don't like
1:22:29
that." And the communities said, "We don't like that either." So, there
1:22:33
was this tug-of-war with people who kept tightening down various
1:22:37
restrictions and dropping the harvest.
1:22:41
When the Interagency Scientific Committee, the
1:22:46
ISC, went back to brief the Chief [USFS – Dale Robertson at time]
1:22:49
, and they had this big meeting.
1:22:50
That was the one [ISC report] that Jack Ward Thomas oversaw.
1:22:52
Correct?
1:22:53
Right.
1:22:54
At the very end of that, they had been working, they worked in our
1:22:56
building, the same building I was in.
1:22:59
Jack would come down, and we'd ask him to come down and tell us what was happening.
1:23:06
When the Portland lab had a meeting, then Jack could come down.
1:23:09
He was a very talkative kind of fellow.
1:23:11
And he'd been a project leader.
1:23:13
He and I were project leaders together.
1:23:15
We shared the same supervisor.
1:23:20
They worked about a year, and then, at the very end, they had to do economic impacts.
1:23:24
And so, one day I was told I had two weeks to do the economic impacts of
1:23:30
their report, because in Jack's world, there were only economic impacts.
1:23:35
He doesn't understand that economics influences the questions, too.
1:23:40
He just sees that, this one side of it?
1:23:43
Yeah, one side of it and then at the very end before he can make his final report,
1:23:47
he has to include the economic impact.
1:23:49
So, I had two weeks to do the economic impacts.
1:23:52
The regional economist, a guy named Alan Fox, and myself,
1:23:56
we did the economic impacts.
1:23:59
And so, we went back to Washington, we presented them, and we were in the meeting
1:24:06
with the head of BLM and [Forest Service] Chief Robertson, and George Leonard,
1:24:15
the Deputy Chief of the Forest Service.
1:24:18
We presented the impacts and they're grim.
1:24:22
They go around the room and finally, old George Leonard says, "Well," and
1:24:27
at the same time, they're all wrestling with the plans, what are we going to do
1:24:30
about these Region 6 west-side plans.
1:24:34
And old George says, "Well, you know, one big boom is better than two little bangs."
1:24:40
[Laughs].
1:24:41
So, he rolled the owl and the other plans together, and got a big boom.
1:24:50
Now, the owl and the ESA, those started to register [politically] in the early '80s.
1:24:57
Correct?
1:24:58
Yes.
1:24:58
In terms of being an issue that was to be considered?
1:25:02
Right, to be considered.
1:25:04
Not the big thing it was later, but it was becoming that.
1:25:08
Right.
1:25:09
There was a lot of controversy over the size of the areas
1:25:15
that would be needed, and they varied across EIS reports, and I did the
1:25:17
economic analysis for those various EISs.
1:25:21
I even have a little engraved glass cup upstairs from one of them.
1:25:28
So, I was busy doing this.
1:25:31
As they went along, I did the economic analysis.
1:25:34
Because, at the same time I was doing the Forest Service's [econ.
1:25:37
anal.] , I was responsible for their RPA [Resources Planning
1:25:40
Act] timber assessments.
1:25:40
We had to do national timber planning.
1:25:44
RPA is an acronym?
1:25:45
Resources Planning Act.
1:25:47
Okay, thank you.
1:25:49
Divided up among the “multiple uses.” there was a range specialist.
1:25:52
I was the timber specialist.
1:25:54
There was a range specialist, a wildlife specialist, a mineral
1:25:58
specialist, and a water one.
1:26:00
Water was always the weak link there.
1:26:05
We organized research efforts and wrote the assessments.
1:26:09
For twenty-five years, I was responsible for writing the timber assessments,
1:26:13
which had a long, long history before me.
1:26:17
There had been five or six of them before I got them, and I worked
1:26:26
on the 1980, '85, '90, '95,
1:26:30
and 2005 ones.
1:26:31
That's why we could do the economic impacts in two weeks if we had
1:26:36
to.
1:26:36
We were always at some stage where we could do that sort of stuff.
1:26:46
Let's see, where were we?
1:26:47
You were asking about
1:26:50
various EIS and ISC reports.
1:26:54
Basically, I was trying to get you to get into the gist of the forest planning
1:26:58
dynamics and problems that were there between 1976 and when everything blew
1:27:05
up in 1989 and '90 with the lawsuit, the Dwyer injunctions and everything
1:27:09
that would lead to ISC, FEMAT, the Clinton Summit, the whole thing.
1:27:15
But before that, just kind of describe that trend.
1:27:19
Well, as I described, the original plans had reasonable timber volumes
1:27:26
from the industry perspective and the traditional perspective.
1:27:29
But
1:27:33
also, you have to remember that the industry collapsed in 1982.
1:27:38
And there was a huge buy-back legislation for timber sales.
1:27:43
We had to buy back sales, as people defaulted on their timber sales.
1:27:46
I also worked on timber sales, as a forest economist, doing studies of competition.
1:27:52
That's the bread-and- butter of being a Forest Service general economist.
1:27:59
So, I worked on the National Appraisal Task Force in the mid-'80s.
1:28:07
We had to buy back a lot of timber.
1:28:09
A lot of people defaulted, and they had to sell it back to us.
1:28:13
We took a loss, a huge loss, actually.
1:28:20
Companies went out of business.
1:28:22
Remind me or for the record-- what was the foundation of the 1982 timber collapse?
1:28:30
It was the recession.
1:28:32
The recession started in the fall of 1979, and it dribbled on and off
1:28:40
until 1984, before a recovery started.
1:28:43
In the timber world, it recovered a year later or so.
1:28:48
Housing starts stopped.
1:28:50
We could look at the statistics.
1:28:53
It dropped off.
1:28:56
It was a recession as great as the recent recession, called the “Great Recession”
1:29:01
now, and it was a very severe recession.
1:29:05
At the same time, you remember, Mount St. Helens went off.
1:29:07
There were people who were thinking grass was going to grow in the
1:29:10
streets of Portland, especially after ash fall the second or third time.
1:29:17
I remember the second big eruption when it blew into Portland.
1:29:21
Yeah, blew into Portland.
1:29:23
It was a mess.
1:29:24
Two inches of it in places.
1:29:26
Right, and it blew around for weeks because it would fall, and then we'd
1:29:31
get another windy day, and you could watch it blow from one roof to another.
1:29:35
Just gritty.
1:29:36
And if you get that stuff in your carburetor, you're in trouble.
1:29:39
Oh, yeah.
1:29:40
We changed air filters on a more regular basis.
1:29:45
In my home and neighborhood, we washed the street down.
1:29:48
We all got together one weekend and I still have a special little
1:29:52
nozzle for my hose to wash ash down.
1:29:55
Then we wheelbarrowed it off, dumped it.
1:29:59
It was a mess.
1:30:01
But forest planning during, say, from
1:30:08
1982 through
1:30:11
'86, as people kept introducing new restrictions or new assumptions
1:30:16
that restricted timber harvest,
1:30:19
the general prospect was that timber harvest was going to fall
1:30:24
dramatically under the new plans.
1:30:26
That was the fear.
1:30:27
And that's even independent of whatever became in the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:30:32
They were already preparing for that.
1:30:34
Right.
1:30:35
Lowered expectations.
1:30:37
Since we had this model of the timber markets, we made runs for both the
1:30:43
industry and preservation interests.
1:30:45
For instance, I did runs for Boise-Cascade, as they were
1:30:48
looking for strategic planning.
1:30:50
I also made runs for the Wilderness Society, because at that time,
1:30:55
they had hired an economist to strengthen arguments they were
1:30:59
making for wilderness preservation.
1:31:02
I knew what both camps were thinking, and I was in-between them.
1:31:10
You know, the environmentalists would have been happy with a twenty-five percent
1:31:15
reduction [in harvest] . That's what they were thinking about the new plans, along
1:31:18
with further wilderness withdrawals.
1:31:20
At the same time, you had Hatfield working on a new Oregon wilderness bill.
1:31:25
So, all these things are going on, and people were starting to look
1:31:32
at the spotted owl, it's threatened status, and what that would mean.
1:31:37
There were a couple of EISs; I remember at least two EIS's being
1:31:41
done that would accommodate the new,
1:31:46
changing views about spotted owl management.
1:31:49
You had the ISC [Interagency Scientific Committee] report
1:31:52
folks, and they were the first ones really that sort of pulled in the
1:32:00
conservation strategy, starting to pull that together for the owl,
1:32:10
and all that sort of came together.
1:32:16
The ISC report made its findings known and the Forest Service
1:32:20
decided to take that in.
1:32:22
You know, George Leonard's "one big boom;" we'll do the new plans
1:32:26
and take the ISC strategy together.
1:32:32
At the same time, we got sued, the Dwyer
1:32:39
suits.
1:32:39
[Seattle Audubon Society 1990 lawsuit, Judge William Dwyer,
1:32:39
1992 injunction stopping logging.]
1:32:40
How would you describe the coalescing of forces?
1:32:45
From the time you got here in the '70s through the '80s, you had all the
1:32:49
environmental laws that were passed in the '60s and '70s, that were in
1:32:55
staggered fashion being understood and used, politically and otherwise, and
1:33:02
then you started to see the maturation of the environmental movement.
1:33:06
All these things are coming together, as well as the rise of the "-ologists"
1:33:11
within the federal agencies, the science people that were there,
1:33:14
but in a much less influential role before the '70s, I would say.
1:33:19
How would you describe that whole coalescing of forces
1:33:23
leading up to the Dwyer decision?
1:33:30
One
1:33:33
anecdote I can remember, when I first got here, I'd go to a Society of American
1:33:38
Foresters meeting, and, depending on the topic, you would be amazed at all of the
1:33:45
pickup trucks with radio antennas on them.
1:33:48
Field foresters would come in for dinner and for the topic.
1:33:54
I remember amongst those topics, we had the business reporter
1:33:59
there for the Oregonian, because forestry was on the business page.
1:34:03
His name was Jim Kadera, and that was his beat.
1:34:05
He was
1:34:10
probably an old-school journalist, who would come every
1:34:14
now and then and talk about
1:34:18
what's important from a business perspective.
1:34:21
And you have to remember, Portland and Seattle were the finance
1:34:25
centers for our timber industry.
1:34:27
They were a very large employer here.
1:34:30
I used to get invited to the Portland Chamber of Commerce to
1:34:33
give talks about log exports.
1:34:37
I'd
1:34:40
also get invited to the Port of Portland.
1:34:43
They'd have breakfast meetings every now and then where they touted
1:34:48
their features for the coming year.
1:34:50
We'd get invited because we were part of that community, the business community.
1:34:59
But, by the time we're speaking about now, we'd moved from the
1:35:02
business pages to the front pages.
1:35:06
As for the culture wars, if you want to call them that, a lot of this
1:35:09
is really the culture wars of the post-modern generation moving into
1:35:16
the natural resource management world.
1:35:17
Right.
1:35:18
I mean, that's how I would characterize it.
1:35:20
That's a fair characterization.
1:35:22
Portland grew enormously in the 1990's, especially this area [Beaverton/suburbs
1:35:27
west of Portland] . When I got here, Intel wasn't here yet.
1:35:30
Intel's so huge [Aloha] , it’s also in Hillsboro.
1:35:33
We have neighbors now who work for Intel or the service
1:35:38
industry that Intel supports.
1:35:40
Yeah, Nike's here, too.
1:35:41
[Beaverton]
1:35:41
Yeah, Nike's just a mile up that way.
1:35:44
Right.
1:35:46
And Nike's going to get bigger and bigger, or at least that particular campus is.
1:35:52
And the traditional industry that was here, Tektronix is much smaller.
1:35:56
And I remember when they were cutting-edge high-tech.
1:35:59
Right.
1:35:59
When I was a kid, people said, "Have you heard about Tektronix?"
1:36:02
This neighborhood was filled with Tektronix people.
1:36:07
Our neighbor across the street was one of their engineers.
1:36:11
He got laid off,
1:36:15
probably in 1990.
1:36:15
Then, he worked for a patent attorney as he did patent description stuff for tech,
1:36:20
and he became a registered patent agent.
1:36:23
That
1:36:27
demonstrates how industries change.
1:36:29
During the fifteen years from 1975 to 1990, one visible thing to me
1:36:35
was we moved from the business page and having Jim Kadera to talk to.
1:36:41
Where I was fielding calls constantly from news reporters who wanted a jobs impact.
1:36:47
I got in a lot of trouble one time after I'd done the ISC economic stuff.
1:36:52
I was on an NPR interview one night, just after the Chief [U.S. Forest Service]
1:36:57
had lectured people about press leaks.
1:37:00
Here
1:37:03
I'm driving home that night, and I heard me say on the radio, "Well, job impacts
1:37:06
aren't hard to do, you just multiply the reduction in harvest by eleven jobs per
1:37:12
million board-feet, and that's the direct impact." My supervisor was here at 9:00
1:37:18
that night with a transcript, wanting to know if I'd really said all that.
1:37:22
What can you say?
1:37:23
I said that.
1:37:24
It's the truth.
1:37:27
And that was when Dale Robertson was Chief [USFS] , correct?
1:37:29
Yeah, he was Chief.
1:37:30
Max Peterson, there was McGuire, and then Dale Robertson.
1:37:35
And Dale was a nice guy.
1:37:38
Well, I knew all the early chiefs because, I actually knew them because I went on the
1:37:49
Hill with McGuire at a time and I had to brief him ahead of time about all that.
1:37:56
I knew Max Peterson, because when he was the Region 8 Forester, he
1:38:00
would come by the schools every spring and give us a little pep talk about
1:38:03
wanting to work for the Forest Service.
1:38:08
He was supportive of research.
1:38:12
And
1:38:16
another, Bob Buchman, had urged us to participate in an international
1:38:21
project called the IIASA Forest Sector Project and so we had briefed
1:38:25
Buchman and Peterson about that.
1:38:28
So, I knew them and had served like a general's aide
1:38:32
once, on a UN forestry tour.
1:38:34
I
1:38:37
don't know if it still goes on, but it was a big deal when you were the host country.
1:38:41
So, I was assigned to it when the U.S. was the host country and
1:38:44
it was coming to the West Coast.
1:38:46
And so, we went from Seattle to San Francisco.
1:38:53
Paralleling this, how was the culture changing within the
1:38:56
Forest Service, at least in your experience out here at that time?
1:39:01
The big change was in who they were selecting as supervisors.
1:39:08
When I first came, they were traditional timber people, folks who mostly came up
1:39:13
on the timber side of the organization.
1:39:17
Supervisors, starting in the
1:39:23
early '90s, were more diverse [gender] and they had more diverse backgrounds,
1:39:30
you had wildlife or range folks.
1:39:35
When you worked on the east side [of Cascades] , you got people in range
1:39:37
conservation, wildlife or something else.
1:39:42
Not too much social science yet.
1:39:43
BLM was further ahead.
1:39:45
But more research and science-y people started having more senior positions,
1:39:50
is that what you're saying, in short?
1:39:52
People who were more interested in what you had to say.
1:39:59
Less of a top-down culture than a more integrated one?
1:40:04
Yeah.
1:40:04
Most of them had been on planning teams or had to
1:40:12
use planning teams.
1:40:13
One thing about a planning team is they teach a process.
1:40:18
If you're successful, you know how to work process effectively.
1:40:23
I was amazed whenever I got assigned to a joint-EIS science team, and I did that
1:40:31
twice, one time in Alaska on the TLMP [Tongass Land Management Plan] , and one
1:40:35
time on the east side, as the Interior Columbia Basin Project was a joint team.
1:40:39
In the Interior Basin Project the scientists hemmed and hawed
1:40:44
about what we're going to do and how we're going to do it.
1:40:46
The EIS people were organized.
1:40:49
Within a couple weeks, they had their basic functions organized, they knew the
1:40:53
steps they had to do, and we're still scratching our heads over deciding which
1:40:59
groups are going to fight each other.
1:41:02
Because they're [EIS people] focused on the process, they knew the
1:41:04
process, and steps in the process.
1:41:05
Right, and by that time it was a very well-developed and understood
1:41:10
process within various agencies, and the Forest Service, in this case.
1:41:13
Or BLM.
1:41:14
I just worked with BLM for the second time, on their resource management plan.
1:41:19
I did the economic stuff on it.
1:41:20
I worked with the economics team.
1:41:23
And yeah, compared to the one they did seven or eight years ago, this one's even
1:41:29
more organized in terms of that – we've got to do this and we do this and this,
1:41:33
and we only have to look at the question this way because that's the way that
1:41:37
the agency managers will look at it.
1:41:42
When you first heard about the Endangered Species Act, and then the
1:41:46
“test cases” [both in 1970s] were on the snail darter [Tellico Dam] and
1:41:49
the whooping crane [Nebraska Sand Hills] that led into the spotted owl.
1:41:52
Did you understand the economic impact this was going to have immediately,
1:41:57
or was it a thing of coming into understanding over a period of time?
1:42:04
You have to understand, I've read the book, Noah's Choice.
1:42:09
If you, and I would recommend that you read the book.
1:42:13
Because you will understand that the people who wrote the Endangered
1:42:15
Species Act knew what they were doing.
1:42:20
And the people who passed the act didn't.
1:42:25
You're talking about Congress versus
1:42:29
--? No.
1:42:31
The people who wrote the act knew
1:42:35
it could have vast consequences.
1:42:38
They weren't thinking that it would be applied, they were thinking more of
1:42:42
it being applied to just to the people who passed it in terms of things like
1:42:46
eagles, and you know, charismatic species.
1:42:50
Megafauna [plus popular species, often mammals/birds] , right.
1:42:52
But it first got applied in an effective way to snail darters.
1:42:56
And people could see what that meant.
1:42:59
The Tellico Dam [Tennessee] . Right.
1:43:02
And then the whooping crane was right after that about a year later.
1:43:05
Yeah, but it didn't involve forest land.
1:43:07
Right, right.
1:43:08
So, yeah, if you thought about it, you knew what was coming.
1:43:12
And the environmentalists did, too.
1:43:14
They thought about it and realized here an effective tool.
1:43:18
Well, they saw it as a political tool, for sure.
1:43:20
Yeah, they did, to achieve their goal.
1:43:22
The original Wilderness Society's goal was really around trying
1:43:26
to preserve old-growth areas.
1:43:29
Early in my career, I served on a Society of American Foresters
1:43:31
[task force on] scheduling the harvest of old-growth timber.
1:43:36
Jack Thomas and John Gordon, Norm Johnson were on it—no, Norm Johnson wasn't on it.
1:43:43
Franklin [Jerry] was on it.
1:43:45
It had all these big names and I was the little name down at the bottom.
1:43:47
I was the numbers person.
1:43:48
So, I put together--
1:43:50
The bean counters, and then there were the “stars.” [Big-name scientists]
1:43:53
Yeah, the bean counters and the stars.
1:43:54
Sorry, to be obvious.
1:43:55
[Laughs]
1:43:58
So, I put together the old-growth inventory for this region.
1:44:07
I knew the facts and knew what was coming.
1:44:10
And the Wilderness Society, since I did work for them, I knew what they wanted.
1:44:17
They wanted to stop the harvest of old-growth timber.
1:44:20
And they were pretty generous in their definition.
1:44:24
They would follow the Forest Service definition, which was 250 years
1:44:29
old or less than ten percent entry, with less than ten percent entry.
1:44:33
It turns out, from the inventory data, you could drop it down, the Washington DNR
1:44:37
used 160 years, and that would be fine.
1:44:41
The stand structure between 160 and 250, doesn't vary very much,
1:44:48
since I looked at the stand structure data by age class, and I'd gotten
1:44:52
an FIA unit to give me the data.
1:44:55
I'm going to ask you a question after we talk about some of the central
1:44:58
things about New Forestry and Franklin.
1:45:01
I worked on that, too.
1:45:02
Yeah, we'll talk about that later.
1:45:04
But since we're right on the edge of the Dwyer thing [spotted
1:45:07
owl injunction] , let's go.
1:45:08
Okay, after the ISC report came out.
1:45:12
Let's go right into that as soon as you get past what you're talking about now.
1:45:14
We got sued.
1:45:16
Are you talking about the Seattle Audubon Society suit?
1:45:18
Okay.
1:45:19
Yes, that's the Dwyer injunction.
1:45:20
Yeah, it's 1989 , and the injunction was 1992 , if I recall?
1:45:24
In the spring.
1:45:25
It was filed and then the injunction was the following year, right?
1:45:28
Yeah.
1:45:29
They filed the injunction, the Forest Service hemmed and hawed, and
1:45:36
the Justice Department said you've got to subpoena your witnesses.
1:45:42
I was subpoenaed because I did the economics along with Jack Thomas.
1:45:46
All of the ISC Committee was subpoenaed.
1:45:48
They were subpoenaed, because some of them, they didn't want
1:45:51
the other side to talk too.
1:45:55
I'm told that I would have been subpoenaed by the other side, too, if
1:45:59
the Forest Service hadn't gotten to me.
1:46:02
I was going to go one way
1:46:06
or the other.
1:46:06
But we were subpoenaed and became, like the witness panel.
1:46:17
There was a time gap.
1:46:19
We were subpoenaed.
1:46:20
Nothing much happened.
1:46:22
We were all deposed about what we'd say, so there were no surprises in that sense.
1:46:30
Then they set the date for the hearings in Seattle.
1:46:35
A [U.S.] Justice Department team was assigned, so I had my own lawyer.
1:46:41
And the only thing I remember about it is he liked lemonade, and I discovered there
1:46:44
was a Mexican restaurant near where we were that served really great lemonade.
1:46:49
And that's in Seattle, right?
1:46:50
No, it was down here in Portland.
1:46:51
In Portland, all right.
1:46:52
Because they came out and explained what you're going to do.
1:46:55
Prepping you before the Seattle hearings.
1:46:57
Okay.
1:46:57
Years before, I had been prepped, the first time I was deposed.
1:47:01
I got the one-hour quick course on how to be an expert witness.
1:47:06
He just reinforced that.
1:47:07
But then you got graduate studies in deposition preparation?
1:47:12
Yeah, so we were housed in an old hotel sort of across the street
1:47:18
from the theater and the court.
1:47:21
By that time, there was a certain amount of political theater going on,
1:47:25
people holding up babies, and so, we'd have to walk through a crowd to get
1:47:28
into the room, those kind of things.
1:47:31
Lots of extra federal marshals standing around.
1:47:36
So, we testified.
1:47:39
Judge Dwyer had given us a set of questions
1:47:45
that we're going to hear testimony on.
1:47:48
He had looked at the case and had come up with a set of questions
1:47:52
that he wanted testimony on.
1:47:56
And so, there was testimony on spotted owl reproduction.
1:48:02
He had a series of questions, including some economics questions.
1:48:06
So, I answered the economics questions and got cross-examined.
1:48:15
Then he decided, you didn't say anything about log exports.
1:48:19
So, he gave me a couple of log export questions.
1:48:22
I had to arrange to
1:48:26
get some big charts made and other things to answer his questions.
1:48:31
They got Fedex-ed up, and the next day or the day after the next, I forget what
1:48:36
the interval was, I got to go on the stand a second time for a primer on log
1:48:42
exports and harvest, relative to timber harvest, just basic data questions.
1:48:50
Each night, us expert witnesses would have dinner together.
1:48:55
But probably after the first day, we knew what the outcome would be
1:48:59
because George Leonard was the Forest Service official who had to testify.
1:49:04
He said at the very beginning that we didn't follow the environmental laws
1:49:10
under the current Bush administration.
1:49:12
We were shortcutting environmental reviews.
1:49:14
And he admitted that, so the rest of the case--
1:49:17
On the stand, he admitted that?
1:49:18
Yeah.
1:49:20
He's a person of great integrity.
1:49:24
In other words, he wasn't willing to overly massage things just to
1:49:28
try to get a favorable ruling?
1:49:30
No.
1:49:33
And he was not going to
1:49:37
do much for the current administration; he wasn't going to jump on his sword
1:49:41
for the current administration.
1:49:42
Are you talking about George H.W. Bush, not the second one?
1:49:48
Yeah.
1:49:48
He was true to what he had to say.
1:49:51
But, you know, we'd all had dinner together.
1:49:54
It was good to talk to the other side, but you're sort of stuck with your side.
1:49:59
Now, you were allowed to speak, witnesses, to each other?
1:50:03
Yeah.
1:50:03
During that period?
1:50:04
There wasn't some, like, there were no gag orders?
1:50:07
No gag orders.
1:50:07
You just didn't speak to the other side.
1:50:11
They kept us together.
1:50:13
What do you remember about being in court and testifying?
1:50:17
Well, the courtroom, actually, was sort of empty.
1:50:19
It wasn't a huge courtroom, but a regular courtroom.
1:50:23
And they had limited who could enter, as the crowds were outside.
1:50:26
Because they were worried about people yelling and stopping it?
1:50:29
Yeah, there was political theater going on in the streets.
1:50:34
Could you hear that inside?
1:50:35
No.
1:50:35
Okay.
1:50:36
Once you got inside the building, there were reporters there.
1:50:41
They were allowed in.
1:50:43
Some of them, a couple of them I knew, because I had
1:50:45
talked to them ahead of time.
1:50:46
And they'd come over and ask questions.
1:50:47
Like the Oregonian reporter, right?
1:50:48
Yeah, like the Oregonian.
1:50:48
There was a woman Oregonian reporter, all through that period, I think,
1:50:53
who eventually wrote a book.
1:50:54
[Kathy Durbin]
1:50:55
I think I know who you're talking about, but I can't remember her name.
1:50:57
I can't remember her name, either.
1:50:59
And
1:51:02
you would go to court to listen to the parts that were interesting to you.
1:51:08
You'd be spending time working on your testimony or working on
1:51:14
responses to questions raised that you might get cross-examined on.
1:51:18
It kept you busy.
1:51:21
The only time you'd really got to talk to each other much was at dinner.
1:51:25
Did you feel it was stressful, enjoyable, or a great experience?
1:51:30
How would you characterize it in retrospect?
1:51:35
Well, in retrospect, I thought it was very significant.
1:51:40
But when I talked at the [PNW] station, I was living in a world of people
1:51:46
who didn't know what was going on.
1:51:48
They knew Jack Thomas was still a [PNW] station employee, but
1:51:55
most of the station was doing what the station does.
1:51:59
Whatever their jobs were, they were doing it?
1:52:01
Right, and we weren't--
1:52:04
And where was the office at that time?
1:52:07
The what?
1:52:08
Where was the PNW Station office?
1:52:10
The [PNW Station] Director's office was shared with Region 6.
1:52:15
And at that time, I was busy moving our lab from one side
1:52:19
of town to the other side.
1:52:20
I was the Director's rep [representative] for the Portland Lab.
1:52:23
So, you guys were plenty busy?
1:52:25
Yeah, I had just moved the lab to this new location, and I had just become,
1:52:33
in the spring of 1991, a program manager, so I had more responsibility.
1:52:47
Dwyer
1:52:50
told us that it would be several weeks or months before he ruled.
1:52:56
And the lawyers said he would rule on a Friday afternoon after
1:53:00
business, or as business shut down, he would rule, which he did.
1:53:05
On a late Friday afternoon, he ruled.
1:53:09
I actually met Dwyer earlier, because he
1:53:14
had married [as judge] friends of mine.
1:53:14
He had married Darius Adams and Claire.
1:53:16
How
1:53:19
interesting.
1:53:20
I had met him, because we went over and he performed the ceremony.
1:53:25
How would you describe William Dwyer?
1:53:29
Very thorough.
1:53:31
He seemed like other lawyers.
1:53:34
He didn't seem to have a point-of-view, and I thought
1:53:37
maybe they all worked that way.
1:53:39
He sent this list of questions, stating that I want testimony on these questions.
1:53:42
He'd looked at the case, and I guess he thought, these are the points that
1:53:49
I want to address, and he was very specific.
1:53:53
Then, as the testimony went on, if he wasn't satisfied, he'd ask more
1:53:58
questions, like the log export questions.
1:54:01
And people would have to go scurrying around.
1:54:03
I think they had to get an extra genetics expert to come in and explain something.
1:54:08
So, it was very professional?
1:54:10
Yes, it was very professional.
1:54:13
And the courtroom was relatively quiet.
1:54:15
The reason I say that, is I often hear people characterize anything connected
1:54:20
to the spotted owl as “environmental fluff.” Now, being twenty-five years
1:54:26
later, and not looked at like this was a serious legal and scientific analysis
1:54:34
of the problem by a competent judge.
1:54:38
I'm talking about how people caricature things in their memories.
1:54:42
Well, I think in the spotted owl wars, Judge Dwyer is often
1:54:45
forgotten . They just start with the Northwest Forest Plan and FEMAT.
1:54:54
Well, some people I'm talking to, they remember who Dwyer is.
1:54:58
Yeah, and because there's some science disciplines who didn't get
1:55:04
to the “big boys' table” until FEMAT.
1:55:07
I'm talking about the social scientists.
1:55:12
They weren't part of the primary discussions in forest management.
1:55:19
So, the ruling came down, what, a few months later?
1:55:22
A little longer than people thought.
1:55:24
People thought that, especially people like George Leonard, who admitted
1:55:33
that the Forest Service did not follow the rules, the environmental rules,
1:55:38
they expected a much quicker ruling.
1:55:40
So, there was some uncertainty.
1:55:42
Now, at the same time this is going on, the Forest Service had been
1:55:46
reselling a lot of those sales that had been bought back or had to buy back
1:55:51
as part of the buy-out legislation.
1:55:53
So, stuff from the '82 recession when the timber prices dropped?
1:55:55
And U.S. timber harvest peaked in 1989.
1:56:00
The U.S. market and the Japanese market boomed simultaneously.
1:56:03
An ironic juxtaposition in history, right?
1:56:07
It peaked.
1:56:08
So, Forest Service timber sales programs were at all-time high levels, where they
1:56:14
were selling lots of sales, but these were sales that had been prepared, some
1:56:17
of them ten years before, and then had been resold or redesigned and resold.
1:56:23
So, the lag effect had a double-whammy to it?
1:56:25
In other words, you were going to not only get the injunction, but you were
1:56:28
going to get the end of whatever this was that had been in the pipeline.
1:56:32
Right, right.
1:56:32
Is that a correct way of [stating things] —okay.
1:56:34
Yeah.
1:56:34
And part of our testimony, my testimony, was is that the effects wouldn't be
1:56:41
felt right away, because you had timber in the pipeline, they would be felt as
1:56:44
this uncut volume on the contract was.
1:56:50
So that was part of the controversy.
1:56:54
At the time, the industry argued as if the price impacts would be huge, and
1:56:59
it's going to raise the cost of housing.
1:57:01
But I put together an estimate that said, no, it's not going
1:57:04
to raise the cost of housing.
1:57:06
And lucky for me, the Weyerhaeuser economist said the same thing, so
1:57:11
the industry stopped that argument.
1:57:13
It was going to have a price impact, but not in the sense it's
1:57:16
going to raise the cost of housing.
1:57:18
Weyerhaeuser obviously could say that, because they had
1:57:21
such gigantic private holdings.
1:57:23
[Especially in southwestern Washington.]
1:57:23
They didn't buy public timber.
1:57:25
If the prices go up, they just make money, and they laugh all the way to the bank.
1:57:32
Aren’t there some people with the cynical view that some of the big players like
1:57:37
that, who had private timber holdings, almost enjoyed aspects of this because
1:57:43
it pinched the market to their advantage?
1:57:45
Well, we're going to come back to that because they--
1:57:47
I just thought that--
1:57:48
And I'm going to explain to you how.
1:57:49
This is based on a rumor that I hear, that I don't necessarily agree with,
1:57:53
but I can see where it could be true.
1:57:59
It could be, but you have to remember that the bulk of private timber land is owned
1:58:03
by individuals, not by big companies.
1:58:06
And Weyerhaeuser was kind of an exception to that rule.
1:58:08
Weyerhaeuser is the one exception.
1:58:10
And Weyerhaeuser, above all things, is a very dedicated land steward.
1:58:17
They take stewardship seriously, and they like to make money, too, of course.
1:58:25
The
1:58:41
Boise-Cascades guy was a guy named Don Smith.
1:58:45
Walter Jerrick was from GP [Georgia-Pacific] or somewhere.
1:58:47
I forget the fourth one, it was from the South.
1:58:50
And they were--
1:58:51
What about Crown Zellerbach?
1:58:52
Were they a player?
1:58:53
No.
1:58:53
They were bought out by then.
1:58:54
Oh, okay.
1:58:56
They were never a big player.
1:58:59
Aren't they more up in Canada?
1:59:01
Yeah, they own McMillen, and they were a [big player] . They got bought
1:59:06
by a guy named Goldschmidt, because he figured out their stock was
1:59:09
grossly undervalued to their assets.
1:59:12
He bought them, sold off the timber land, then ran the mills until they
1:59:18
essentially couldn't run any more.
1:59:19
Sold them, too.
1:59:22
But
1:59:29
in the period between the Dwyer injunction and FEMAT, we came to
1:59:35
understand what the economic impacts were.
1:59:44
At the same time, there was an election.
1:59:48
I was surprised as I'd drive in the countryside, the rural areas in Oregon,
1:59:53
in that there were no Bush signs.
1:59:56
The
2:00:00
traditional rural support for Republicans was not there, because they felt betrayed.
2:00:05
Because of what happened during this whole process?
2:00:09
Yeah, during the whole process.
2:00:13
Mills were saying we're going to have to start cutting down because
2:00:17
there's no sales, and the Forest Service wasn't selling anything.
2:00:22
People were cutting the uncut volume under contract.
2:00:25
And you can see the end of that.
2:00:29
At the same time, we had a recession, the 1991 recession.
2:00:34
And I can remember testifying that I couldn't tell the difference
2:00:38
right now between the injunction
2:00:40
-- And the recession?
2:00:41
And the recession.
2:00:42
Because, as an economist, you're observing shut-downs,
2:00:46
you're observing price changes,
2:00:53
but then, in a couple years, we started to recover from the recession, and
2:01:05
prices [timber] spiked.
2:01:05
We had a price spike in 1993.
2:01:08
Because of the supply/demand dynamic?
2:01:12
Yeah, the supply, and that price spike was enough to bring on types of materials
2:01:20
that we had not used before, things which had been sitting on the shelves,
2:01:24
used for engineered wood products.
2:01:25
Right, but smaller circumference wood.
2:01:28
Right.
2:01:28
Things that would have been considered junk or scrap or whatever.
2:01:31
Right, and at the same time,
2:01:35
unobserved largely, was
2:01:38
what happened with the old traditional mills.
2:01:41
We had the 1982 to '84 recession.
2:01:44
The old thinking was that during a recession, mills don't retool,
2:01:48
they just sort of shut down, and then, they start back up.
2:01:52
What happened during that recession, was that a lot of the mills
2:01:56
retooled to become small log mills.
2:01:59
Those were the smart ones.
2:02:00
They were the smart ones.
2:02:01
Largely they did that because people that held their bonds forced them.
2:02:08
Instead of defaulting, it'd be cheaper if you guys just kept
2:02:11
operating, but you're going to do it, and take all the labor out of it.
2:02:15
If you think of an old mill, you had the green chain, you had
2:02:18
twenty-five guys standing out there pulling boards off a green chain.
2:02:22
Well, in 1986, if you went back, there would only be one or two people
2:02:26
because it's now all automated.
2:02:28
There are twenty-five people [jobs] who disappeared.
2:02:29
They
2:02:32
never came back.
2:02:36
The U.S. industry during that recession, forced wages down that broke the union.
2:02:42
It used to be that Canadian and American producers shared the same union.
2:02:47
But the Canadian producers didn't take that, as they
2:02:50
wouldn't take a wage reduction.
2:02:52
That also parallels or follows the Reagan years’ attack on unions,
2:02:57
which started with the air traffic controllers as part of a broader
2:03:02
cultural dynamic against organized labor.
2:03:06
It had been in the works for quite a while.
2:03:07
Yeah, it was part of all that.
2:03:10
Weyerhaeuser forced them [wages] down, and essentially said, you
2:03:13
guys take a reduction or we’ll shift production to the South.
2:03:17
They said, here's our cost, you're competing in that market.
2:03:22
I gave a lot of talks at that time about how you've got to be cost
2:03:26
competitive to compete to supply.
2:03:29
The main driver on the supply side is cost.
2:03:37
The hardest audiences I had to talk to were any of the labor union-related
2:03:42
audiences, because as an economist, I had nothing good to say to
2:03:50
them.
2:03:51
Like globalization, we talk about it now, it was already in force back then.
2:03:54
Right.
2:03:55
But now, it's on hyperdrive because of high technology and the internet, and
2:04:00
people think in terms of globalization as a primary default, mentally.
2:04:05
But it flattens the world.
2:04:05
Yeah.
2:04:05
Read Thomas Friedman's book on the “flat world,”
2:04:11
and it's true.
2:04:12
You were competing against what we used to call the Third World or developing world.
2:04:17
That whole dynamic changes your bargaining power.
2:04:22
It's the reason we don't produce much furniture in the U.S. any more.
2:04:26
Ever since Pottery Barn successfully convinced people to buy knocked-down
2:04:30
furniture, nice looking knocked-down furniture, it wiped out the Broyhills
2:04:35
and factories in Lexington [Kentucky] and High Point, North Carolina.
2:04:41
We bought some Broyhill furniture after we remodeled the house that I live in now,
2:04:47
but it's made in Vietnam.
2:04:48
Uh-huh.
2:04:49
For Broyhill, or they put the stamp on it, or whatever they did.
2:04:53
Actually, I went through one of those factories in Malaysia.
2:04:57
It was a Chinese-owned factory and they'd just been moving it down.
2:05:02
The day I was there, they were making bar stools and shipping them to Home Depot.
2:05:08
They were putting them in a container and it was made out of rubber- wood.
2:05:11
But it was Swedish equipment owned by Chinese.
2:05:15
Chinese are the traditional merchants of Southeast Asia,
2:05:19
or they were Taiwanese-Chinese.
2:05:22
It's amazing how with forests, now that they've become part capitalist,
2:05:27
part whatever you would call their government, they've reversed that really
2:05:31
600-year long trend, where China, the great power, withdrew into itself.
2:05:38
Now, they're coming back.
2:05:40
Right, they're coming back.
2:05:41
They were always the great power in Southeast Asia.
2:05:45
When I was in Vietnam, they owned the rice mills, or Chinese merchants did.
2:05:50
Next to Saigon, there was a town called Cho Lon, which was
2:05:53
the Chinese part of Saigon.
2:05:56
But it was very Chinese.
2:05:59
They're traditional merchants, and they owned all the rice mills
2:06:05
and any kind of manufacturing.
2:06:08
It was their money.
2:06:10
Let's return back to after the Dwyer decision.
2:06:14
Tell me what's happening, and take us up through the ISC, the Gang
2:06:21
of Four, and then into FEMAT, or the Clinton Summit and then FEMAT.
2:06:26
Kind of take us through that based on your experience?
2:06:31
Well, the Gang of Four had no economic questions, so it
2:06:34
was just the Gang of Four.
2:06:36
I knew all four, but they were so busy.
2:06:45
I knew Thomas better, and the thing he kept talking about was
2:06:49
the role of expert judgment.
2:06:53
On one hand, he was hesitant of the gladiator-type fighting where one
2:06:59
expert duels with another, but at the same time how much information do you
2:07:05
have to have to make a good judgment?
2:07:11
And make sure you don't contribute to our ant problem.
2:07:16
[Laugh] We're talking about cookies [ants in room].
2:07:20
Back to the question.
2:07:22
But so, in the Gang of Four, whenever I'd talk to him [Thomas]
2:07:30
, that was a perennial concern.
2:07:33
During that time, I was busy working on the 1990 RPA timber assessment.
2:07:38
I'm a program manager, and at that time, it was a shared
2:07:43
leadership kind of commitment.
2:07:46
Every month I had to take a week to go meet with the leadership team, and we
2:07:50
wrestled with transforming the [PNW] Station from a project to a program basis.
2:07:56
And there was a lot of stuff going on to stay busy.
2:08:01
And I was still involved in the international work stemming from the IIASA
2:08:07
Forestry Sector Project , still trying to worry about forest sector modeling.
2:08:16
Let's see, if I remember,
2:08:22
1992.
2:08:25
Clinton got elected.
2:08:27
There was going to be a Forest Summit.
2:08:31
As they put together the people to attend the Forest Summit,
2:08:37
a lot of people thought I would be asked to attend, but the OSU folks sort of got
2:08:43
in the way, so one of the economists who attended was a person named Brian Grieber,
2:08:50
who had only peripherally been involved.
2:08:53
But I was never on Norm Johnson's Christmas card list.
2:08:58
Somewhere, early on, he had been sort of astonished that I'd
2:09:03
gotten a Forest Science article, as he was the economics editor.
2:09:07
I had gotten a Forest Science article accepted with what he saw
2:09:10
as some very simple, two or three, very simple regression equations.
2:09:16
He thought it wasn't rigorous enough.
2:09:22
But I pointed out to him, it got accepted.
2:09:25
And second, it's not the equations that are important, it's the theory you're
2:09:30
showing, [and in this case] that there had been a fundamental mistake in how
2:09:34
people had related forest products markets from product to stumpage.
2:09:39
And that you only needed a couple simple regressions to show
2:09:42
that they had a made a mistake.
2:09:44
Sometimes, the simplest is the truest and the best.
2:09:47
Yeah, but that's not Norm.
2:09:52
Anyway, Norm had a low opinion, or lower opinion, of my skills.
2:09:58
Brian was
2:10:02
more pliable, I think,
2:10:06
and he attended the Forest Summit.
2:10:09
I did a lot of preparatory stuff for various people, but I didn't attend.
2:10:18
The Forest Summit promised there would be a FEMAT.
2:10:21
So, when FEMAT came, I got rounded up.
2:10:24
They sort of got all the warm bodies.
2:10:28
Well, you had ninety days, you needed lots of bodies, and lots of minds.
2:10:34
There were three of us on the economics team; Brian, myself,
2:10:38
and Cindy Swanson, who was there because she had done wildlife
2:10:44
valuing, and the social science team.
2:10:52
Brian and I looked at the stuff I'd done for the Dwyer trial.
2:10:58
We redid the analysis, given these particular harvest reductions.
2:11:04
We knew what the results were going to show.
2:11:07
Cindy Swanson
2:11:10
reminded us not to be quite so market-driven and to be a little
2:11:15
broader, and we wrote up the economic stuff and turned our report in.
2:11:19
There are two anecdotes I'll tell you.
2:11:22
One was, every afternoon, we'd have these meetings, or not, every day,
2:11:27
but most every day, was this meeting, and we'd sit around the table.
2:11:30
The big shots sat up front.
2:11:33
Are you talking about in the Pink Tower?
2:11:34
In the Pink Tower.
2:11:35
This was in downtown Portland, the Pink Tower, which is the United Bank building?
2:11:39
Right, United Bank building.
2:11:40
Okay.
2:11:42
Since I had an office in Portland, I didn't need to go to the Pink Tower.
2:11:45
I only went to the Pink Tower when they had these formal meetings.
2:11:48
Okay.
2:11:48
In the formal meetings, they would be arguing some particular point.
2:11:51
And the economists and the social scientists, we got to sit at the end
2:11:55
of the table sort of over in the left corner furthest from the kitchen, you
2:11:58
know, the crumbs level on the table.
2:12:01
In other words, the ecologists, the biologists, the forest people,
2:12:05
those were the central people?
2:12:07
Right.
2:12:08
Right.
2:12:08
And it was interesting.
2:12:10
The main argument was between people like Jerry Franklin, who said, "Well, tell
2:12:14
us what type of habitat you need and we can grow it. We can manipulate stands to
2:12:20
give you that habitat." And, like I said, I'm going to tell you three anecdotes.
2:12:26
Okay.
2:12:26
One day, the guy from the [U.S.] Fish and Wildlife Service, whose name I can't
2:12:30
remember right now, stood up, crossed his arms, and said, "You are going to do
2:12:35
it this way because our bird's listed."
2:12:39
Are we talking about the murrelet or the spotted owl?
2:12:41
Spotted owl.
2:12:42
Because the murrelet was already listed, or was it yet?
2:12:44
I don't think it was.
2:12:45
Okay.
2:12:48
The other anecdote was
2:12:52
that we had gotten along, and we, the economists, had presented our results.
2:12:57
All we did was present some results and tables and do this gathering
2:13:01
of the main thinkers and they thanked us for the economic impacts.
2:13:05
But that afternoon,
2:13:12
oh, geez, his name has just slipped my mind.
2:13:14
My cohort, my other economist cohort, he and I were talking, and Gordie
2:13:20
Reeves comes up to us, very distraught because he's finally realized what
2:13:25
we've been trying to tell him all along; harvest levels and acres are colinear.
2:13:31
You reduce acres, you reduce harvest.
2:13:34
You just can't move harvest around.
2:13:38
In the volume regulation they use, they are linked.
2:13:43
He had just realized it because, and you have to remember that the heart of
2:13:50
FEMAT, it's a dual-habitat conservation strategy that connects PACFISH,
2:13:55
which I also worked on, I did the economic analysis for PACFISH,
2:13:59
and it's the economic analysis for the fish conservation strategy,
2:14:01
and it's parallel with the habitat conservation strategy for spotted owls.
2:14:07
So, you have your terrestrial and your aquatic, picking a parallel.
2:14:13
The way they combined them is a connected habitat strategy.
2:14:16
So you have, say, a cluster that's an owl habitat area, and it's connected
2:14:21
by a riparian zone to the next owl [habitat unit] . You can think of
2:14:25
it like splotches connected with corridors, connecting corridors.
2:14:30
They used riparian corridors to connect the spotted owl habitat units.
2:14:35
When you do that, you take a lot of acres out and you drop harvest.
2:14:39
For some reason, Gordie had never figured that out.
2:14:43
He didn't realize it.
2:14:46
The third anecdote was at the very end when we're having a grand presentation.
2:14:55
All the political types are in the room.
2:15:01
There were two political watchdogs.
2:15:03
Tom Tuchman was one.
2:15:06
They were in rooms most of the time.
2:15:09
I forget who the other one was.
2:15:10
[James Pipkin, asst. to Sec. of Int.
2:15:11
Bruce Babbitt]
2:15:11
Jim Lyons, was he there?
2:15:11
Yeah, he was there, in and out.
2:15:14
Jim Lyons is sort of a flighty kind of person, where Tom Tuchman's
2:15:17
a more serious kind of person.
2:15:21
I knew both of them from different
2:15:26
experiences, had worked with them in years prior.
2:15:30
But we were having this big, sort of the political roll-out.
2:15:34
Finally, it comes down to my turn to talk, and somebody says, "Well, what's
2:15:40
going to be the economic impact?
2:15:42
You know, how can you describe it succinctly?" And I said,
2:15:44
"Well, the economic impact for
2:15:48
most American families will be about the cost of a pizza dinner."
2:15:55
There's a woman named Margaret Shannon, who was in the room also,
2:15:58
and she said that when I said that, the political types sighed
2:16:03
with a great sigh of relief.
2:16:07
But they're talking about nationally?
2:16:10
Yeah.
2:16:10
Not the influence on—
2:16:12
Local.
2:16:12
Regional, but also local.
2:16:14
Yeah, we had talked about that.
2:16:16
But they asked, what is the
2:16:20
broad impact?
2:16:21
Well, it's going to cost the average American family about
2:16:25
the cost of a pizza dinner.
2:16:28
Wow.
2:16:29
And if you don't have Margaret Shannon on your list of folks [to
2:16:35
interview] , she was a keen observer.
2:16:37
She was on the social
2:16:45
science team.
2:16:45
This is a more specific question relating to what you just talked about.
2:16:50
What were your goals going in to the FEMAT process, and how did you strategize
2:16:56
to complete the task/mission given by the team to complete the process?
2:17:04
Also, how successful do you feel you were at carrying out
2:17:08
your original mission or goal?
2:17:10
Well, we were very successful.
2:17:13
Again, they just asked for economic impacts,
2:17:18
which we knew since I had done them already for the Dwyer injunction.
2:17:25
We knew what they were going to be, and it was just a matter of getting
2:17:28
the correct harvest numbers tied to a specific [national] forest, and
2:17:33
then making some inferences by the different sub-areas that they wanted.
2:17:38
So, it was for us a very straight-forward task.
2:17:43
Was it less free of the political and judgments made by the other
2:17:48
members of the team, where things were, shall we say, more “squishy?”
2:17:53
Yeah, that's a fair thing to say.
2:17:55
Once they had come up with what acres could be in the Matrix lands, then you
2:18:04
could compute the timber flows from that.
2:18:05
Once we had timber flows from Norm [Johnson] , it was just a
2:18:10
straight-forward analysis, very similar to the analyses we've done.
2:18:15
Didn't have to do anything new.
2:18:16
The only new stuff was splitting into the sub-regions that they wanted.
2:18:21
Also, you had to come up with numbers for each of the ten alternatives?
2:18:25
Yes, but they're just changes in timber flows.
2:18:29
You do the analysis for, say,
2:18:32
101 million board-feet, then you do the analysis for 110 million board-feet.
2:18:39
It's just a number.
2:18:40
What do you think about
2:18:46
the zoning scheme, the idea of the reserves [Late-Successional] , the Matrix,
2:18:48
the AMA's, the aquatic and the core?
2:18:48
How
2:18:55
do you feel about how that was designed?
2:18:59
I always thought that
2:19:05
it was not well-designed.
2:19:08
I now realize one of the things that was a problem, was that we had assumed
2:19:14
that people were willing to experiment, they were willing to take chances, or
2:19:20
to tolerate some risk and experiment with different ways to manage.
2:19:25
What we didn't realize was that actual land managers are highly risk-averse, and
2:19:33
so there's no incentive for them to, say, modify your riparian standards in an AMA,
2:19:46
or in a riparian zone from the Aquatic Conservation Strategy.
2:19:49
[NWFP]
2:19:49
Weren't a lot of typical manager types not in the central FEMAT panning?
2:19:55
They were not there.
2:19:56
That's what I mean.
2:19:57
So, you're talking about the managers of the type that were in
2:20:02
the FEMAT process , were more the science-research types, rather than
2:20:08
the traditional admin-manager types?
2:20:10
That's what I'm talking about.
2:20:11
Yes.
2:20:11
It turns out the people who were becoming our district rangers,
2:20:15
the lowest level of line officer.
2:20:21
We only thought of them about the few of them that we had worked with,
2:20:28
but didn't think about what the typical fellow or woman would do.
2:20:34
That was a problem throughout the
2:20:39
FEMAT and post-FEMAT efforts.
2:20:40
We did not understand where the incentives would be to experiment, change, or
2:20:50
modify standards and guidelines.
2:20:52
Within the FEMAT framework?
2:20:54
Within the FEMAT framework, the FEMAT process set core standards and
2:20:59
guidelines, but they also set ways to change them, but there was no incentive.
2:21:05
If I'm a district ranger, and it says, I've got to have a tree height
2:21:09
buffer, I'm going to have a tree height buffer, that's the easy thing to do.
2:21:13
Don't create and don't innovate, in other words?
2:21:18
Why should I innovate?
2:21:21
I'm being judged on how I implement things.
2:21:24
It's a focus on inputs and not on outputs.
2:21:28
I worked with a science community that never understood that.
2:21:32
And I couldn't get that through to people.
2:21:35
Elaborate a little more on that point?
2:21:36
Well, the aquatic people talked like they understood production processes.
2:21:42
They would talk as if they understood that if you combined these inputs,
2:21:46
you can get these kinds of outputs.
2:21:49
It turns out, that was all talk.
2:21:50
It was part of their “group think.” They really focused on the input,
2:21:54
like we've got to have a one-tree buffer or a two-tree buffer.
2:21:59
And they couldn't explain to you why, what is the marginal difference?
2:22:05
Do I get more fish?
2:22:07
Do I get twice the number of fish if I have a two-tree buffer?
2:22:12
They talked as if they understood that process, but they didn't.
2:22:16
They were doing it because they thought it sounded good?
2:22:20
Well, it sounded good and it reduced a risk.
2:22:23
Right.
2:22:24
You know, they combined a lot of things.
2:22:26
But they focused on the inputs and not on the output.
2:22:28
What's the outcome that you want to get to?
2:22:36
We'll come back to that when we talk about the Interior Columbia Basin Project.
2:22:40
Okay, all right.
2:22:41
But in FEMAT, it was focused on the inputs.
2:22:44
And historically, I just finished reading a book looking at the
2:22:49
shift to ecosystem management.
2:22:51
And even the scientists that I work with have just written a book
2:22:57
called, People, Places and Forests.
2:22:59
They're trying to talk as if this is some great science, like we've shifted it.
2:23:05
But it misses a lot because it doesn't speak to the objectives
2:23:10
you're managing land for.
2:23:13
It's as if the objectives already have the very best science.
2:23:18
What's the outcome you're trying to achieve?
2:23:21
And who for?
2:23:24
You know, you're managing forest land, this is public forest
2:23:28
land, and you're managing it in trust for future generations.
2:23:32
How do you do that?
2:23:33
How do you meet their needs while meeting your needs?
2:23:36
Right.
2:23:37
I thought during the same time that the sustainable forestry debate
2:23:41
has changed more broadly into a sustainable development debate.
2:23:45
That's to increase economic prosperity that's environmentally
2:23:49
sound and socially just.
2:23:51
Where does FEMAT fit in that?
2:23:55
Think about it.
2:23:56
It doesn't.
2:23:59
It's scientists on the loose.
2:24:00
This is managing like we want you to manage it.
2:24:02
Well, that's one of the big criticisms of FEMAT.
2:24:05
It is.
2:24:06
Immediately after, but even now long-term, that certain things that
2:24:10
were supposedly promised or more, prospects did not exactly play out the
2:24:16
way they were outlined in the plan.
2:24:20
Yeah, you couldn't even get Region 6 to sell their reduced cut.
2:24:23
But you had scientists, basically, scientists and more scientists
2:24:28
and more scientists, which is a novel thing and I think there was
2:24:32
a really good aspect to that, but, and I'm putting a big "but" there.
2:24:37
I think we're starting to see some of the shortcomings that were, number
2:24:42
one, that the plan [NWFP] was open to criticism, justifiably so, from day one.
2:24:48
And then you can tell me about maybe some of the specific examples of
2:24:54
what its shortfalls had proven to be.
2:24:56
But that's kind of my take on it.
2:24:59
Even though I thought it was a very novel idea, I can see
2:25:01
where it would be problematic.
2:25:03
Yeah.
2:25:07
And perhaps in a historical context, people will say it was an abrupt way
2:25:14
to shift land management objectives without having a discussion
2:25:18
about land management objectives.
2:25:21
Well, you're basically saying, look at the land managers, they have made
2:25:25
a mess of this thing, so now the scientists can figure it all out.
2:25:28
And now in history, one of the good things, but also the problem in
2:25:34
the “objectivist paradigm,” which
2:25:39
like science, there was always some objective paradigm that's
2:25:42
the model for all things.
2:25:44
And I think the illusion was based in that.
2:25:46
If we get a bunch of scientists free from politics in a room, they're going
2:25:51
to come up with a more objective, rational, sustainable solution.
2:25:57
And I think that is a very naïve assumption myself.
2:26:00
Yeah.
2:26:01
And even historians, we self-critique ourselves because there was often
2:26:06
the assumption that the objectivist paradigm and the historian who really
2:26:10
sticks to it, is going to come up with more or less a better representation
2:26:14
of history, and their analysis is going to be more true and stronger.
2:26:19
But everybody's got filters.
2:26:21
Everybody's got biases, even when you really try to be fair and all that stuff.
2:26:26
So, that's kind of my little opinion about that.
2:26:29
Oh, it's a fair one, because the post-World War II experience is
2:26:33
based on the idea that science and technology won the war for us, and
2:26:39
that if we rely more on that, we'll improve our lives and prosperity.
2:26:44
There's lots of good examples of that.
2:26:47
Teflon, for example, was invented as a coating for tank tracks in snow and ice.
2:26:53
And now, we use it in our kitchens all the time.
2:26:58
But I will also say geography won World War II because we were
2:27:03
not attacked, invaded and bombed.
2:27:05
We were the industrial base for the Allies.
2:27:09
Became the industrial base.
2:27:10
Well, yeah.
2:27:11
There's several interesting books recently about “Fortress America,” about how
2:27:18
you take a Ford production plant and turn it into a B-24 factory using the
2:27:22
same techniques [production-assembly line] . The U.S. was able to do machine
2:27:29
millwork far better than others, largely because there was a Ford engineer
2:27:36
who ran a lot of the early stuff.
2:27:41
And just in his mind, “well, an airplane's like a car,” we can
2:27:45
build them bigger and better.
2:27:47
Henry Kaiser, you know, this is Henry Kaiser's thinking.
2:27:49
[Shipbuilder/industrialist]
2:27:50
Ships, right.
2:27:51
The only legacy we have of Kaiser today is the Kaiser health plan that survived.
2:27:58
That's a good thing, a health plan.
2:28:00
Imagine that?
2:28:01
But it's the health plan that he had for his ship yards.
2:28:04
We are Kaiser [Permanente] members, and have been for years.
2:28:06
One advantage of the war.
2:28:09
But,
2:28:12
I stepped away from FEMAT because from the economic side, there
2:28:17
wasn't any money to do more work.
2:28:22
That's not true for social science folks.
2:28:24
For them, FEMAT was the first time they got to the table.
2:28:28
You're talking about the original 90 days [FEMAT] , which
2:28:31
I think they extended to 120.
2:28:31
[Actually was 60, extended to 90]
2:28:33
They did.
2:28:33
So then, you're done with that, all the rest of the people go home and the social
2:28:38
scientists, you say, still continued on?
2:28:40
Well, they had gotten cross-wise, as they had done some surveys
2:28:44
and they had gotten cross-wise on information requests about that.
2:28:50
But
2:28:53
it gave focus to the social science research community
2:28:56
that they hadn't had before.
2:28:57
Because before, they had worked on a hodge-podge of stuff, most
2:29:00
of them did recreation work, and social science and community work.
2:29:06
It gave them a new dimension, a new focus.
2:29:10
Before, economists had worked on the community question because
2:29:13
of timber-dependent communities.
2:29:16
But they expanded it into community well-being, and it really did
2:29:20
stimulate a lot of social science on how you measure change in these
2:29:27
forest-dependent communities.
2:29:29
And so, that was a good, a positive outcome.
2:29:35
A couple years afterwards, I became responsible for the [PNW]
2:29:39
station’s social science work.
2:29:41
But right after FEMAT was done, I got assigned to the east side project,
2:29:45
the Interior Columbia Basin Project.
2:29:48
So, for the next several years I worked the east side issues, and only came
2:29:53
back to the Northwest Forest Plan after one time in a station leadership
2:29:57
committee, our current station director at the time, Tom Mills, was touting
2:30:02
how great the FEMAT science was.
2:30:04
And I said, "How do you know it's great?
2:30:06
We haven't looked at it and tried to measure its greatness." So, I got
2:30:10
assigned to write the first, and you have it in there, the "Highlights of the
2:30:16
Science Contributions to Implementing the FEMAT." And in that, I began to
2:30:23
discover some of the things we didn't do well, and one of them is the risk.
2:30:27
That leads me to the question I was just going to ask you.
2:30:30
If you're going to gauge things afterwards, maybe in a few years,
2:30:36
what did FEMAT do well and what did it not do well, in your view?
2:30:40
Well, the--
2:30:40
What were the shortcomings and the successes?
2:30:42
Its big shortcoming was that it didn't spend enough time on the
2:30:45
implementation, thinking, “How will people implement this?” It didn't do that.
2:30:51
It assumed people would experiment, because, at that time, adaptive
2:30:59
management seemed like such a good thing,
2:31:04
and people didn't do that.
2:31:05
The AMA idea seemed like a great idea.
2:31:08
It did, it did.
2:31:10
The best scientists of the day, [C.S.] Hollings and those folks,
2:31:13
were extreme advocates for it.
2:31:15
If you think about it, and me thinking about my military training,
2:31:19
they taught adaptive management.
2:31:26
There was always an exercise and invariably it involved, you
2:31:30
take an objective and you get graded on taking the objective.
2:31:39
The military has these little acronyms, like estimate, and “E” means this.
2:31:43
Well,
2:31:47
you have to consolidate your position because you have to
2:31:50
be prepared for the next thing.
2:31:52
In those exercises, as soon as you sort of got to the objective,
2:31:58
if you weren't quick in consolidating the position, you got attacked
2:32:02
again, or you got attacked anyway.
2:32:05
But you got good points if you responded, and bad points if you didn't.
2:32:13
So, they taught adaptive management.
2:32:15
And they also taught, you're going to take the hill this way, and
2:32:18
then you get halfway along and they say, okay, these people are dead.
2:32:24
Now, take the hill with what you've got left.
2:32:27
That was the "Fort Benning School of Leadership." [Ft.
2:32:30
Benning, Georgia.] I'd been through that and I did very well.
2:32:35
So, adaptive management, to me, wasn't anything—and at the same time, I
2:32:40
was trying to organize the station's discussions around risk management.
2:32:45
My whole master's thesis was on decision-making under uncertainty,
2:32:50
so I was trying to get the station to think more about risk assessment,
2:32:54
you know, where does our work fit into a formal risk assessment model.
2:33:00
And I wasn't doing very well, because
2:33:05
in forestry, people tend to comingle risk management and risk assessment.
2:33:10
They look at a problem, and think, I've got a solution to that problem.
2:33:13
Our bug people were terrible.
2:33:15
You know, if you've got dying trees, we've got to do this.
2:33:19
Well, no, no, no.
2:33:20
Why do we have dying trees?
2:33:21
What are the risks?
2:33:22
And then how do you manage those risks.
2:33:24
Separating that, it's a two-step process.
2:33:26
The other two steps in risk management are risk communication,
2:33:35
and then, risk perception.
2:33:36
And not everybody sees risks the same way.
2:33:41
The thing that most people have to said to me about the AMA's were, like you
2:33:47
said, a good idea, but the context and reality of implementation is the most
2:33:56
common that I've heard about, and a more general principle across the whole
2:33:59
shebang is “survey and manage.” [Survey for multiple species in management
2:34:02
areas to gauge environmental impacts.]
2:34:03
Yeah, see, that has no economic counterpart.
2:34:06
But I mean, in terms of managerial practicalities on the ground, and I think
2:34:13
it was Norm who said this or somebody else, but they basically put a fine
2:34:17
filter on a process that would have been better served by a coarse filter.
2:34:22
Right, yeah.
2:34:24
It mucked things up to the point of almost guaranteeing stopping
2:34:29
[NWFP] mechanisms from functioning.
2:34:30
Then you throw in environmental groups and lawsuits, and everything
2:34:35
kind of grinds to a halt, and even less than the economic predictions
2:34:38
you and your team came up with.
2:34:41
Would you say that is a fair assessment?
2:34:42
Yeah, it's a fair assessment.
2:34:44
There were people, advocates for various species groups, who got to the table and
2:34:54
into the writing of the standards and guides, and I think Norm's point of about
2:34:59
“fine” and “coarse” is a good point.
2:35:01
But that goes back to your three planning levels.
2:35:04
You always have to remember what level you're planning at.
2:35:08
That fine filter stuff, you don't really get it until you're down here
2:35:11
in the weeds, at the finest scales.
2:35:14
You know, it was just a lot of misunderstanding.
2:35:17
There wasn't an adult at the table that
2:35:23
dealt with the “here's how we implement this.”
2:35:26
I know the aquatic scientists in their Aquatic Conservation Strategy
2:35:33
made the other scientists really jealous because it was a coherent strategy
2:35:37
for how to manage the species, where the other folks didn't have a coherent
2:35:42
strategy that included restoration.
2:35:45
So, it made them jealous.
2:35:47
But to their credit, the aquatic people had a strategy.
2:35:51
If you think about it, that's a risk management strategy.
2:35:56
They didn't have a good way to assess the risk.
2:35:59
And their way of doing that
2:36:06
sounded an awful lot like planning.
2:36:07
What they thought that somebody could do that on an afternoon, or,
2:36:12
you know, it was a quick process.
2:36:14
But they didn't understand that a forest management team would look at
2:36:17
that and say that's a planning process.
2:36:20
And because it's a process, we've got to do this and this and this and this.
2:36:24
You know, they didn't understand that.
2:36:27
So, when they thought we could do that quickly, that risk assessment step
2:36:32
quickly turned into a very difficult step.
2:36:37
So--
2:36:37
But I stepped away from all that because I got assigned to the east side.
2:36:42
Okay, tell me a little about the Interior Columbia Basin Project.
2:36:46
Well, while all this is going on, on the west side, the east side is saying,
2:36:53
cynically, they were saying, "How do we keep this from spreading to the
2:36:56
east side?" And the Forest Service is looking at the east, saying, "Well,
2:37:03
we've got these changes on the west, do we have these same issues on the east
2:37:07
side?" They'd had PACFISH go on a couple years before-hand, and the headwaters of
2:37:12
the PACFISH are all over on the east side.
2:37:13
I was working the Columbia and Snake, the sockeye issue.
2:37:20
The thing about PACFISH was that when we did the analysis, mostly
2:37:24
it just meant that you had to get the stuff out of the streams.
2:37:28
You'd change road crossings, how you do road crossings.
2:37:31
You leave wider buffer strips along streams.
2:37:36
It actually had a bigger impact on recreation and on mining because
2:37:41
over there, mining was a hobby activity, a recreational activity,
2:37:46
people operating old mines, messing up the streams, and you had a lot of
2:37:50
campgrounds where people did stuff.
2:37:52
And that's an education, for law enforcement and education.
2:37:56
Don't pee in the streams, folks, use the outhouses, move the outhouses
2:38:00
across the road, that kind of stuff.
2:38:03
And there was use in some of these, you know, amateur miners
2:38:07
would use certain chemicals?
2:38:09
Yeah.
2:38:09
In trying to extract whatever or separate whatever, correct?
2:38:12
In terms of economic impacts, we had to estimate how much it would cost to buy
2:38:16
out those claims because you couldn't, well, you could regulate, say, or control
2:38:23
chemicals, but you couldn't regulate how they used suction dredges, or, well,
2:38:28
I guess you could regulate the season they could use section dredges, but
2:38:31
it still puts out a lot of sediment.
2:38:34
We did the analysis on buying out claims.
2:38:37
And there were a lot of claims.
2:38:40
But, so, I had done PACFISH.
2:38:44
So, I got assigned to do economics there, and worked from 1993 to
2:38:52
2001 other than doing that west-side summary report, trying to get them
2:38:58
to be better about risk assessments, which was a losing battle.
2:39:00
So
2:39:05
now, you're still on the home turf here in Portland as the manager?
2:39:09
Yeah.
2:39:13
But my work is over on the east side and in Alaska.
2:39:16
But let me finish my point.
2:39:17
In 1995, the final report [NWFP] comes out to the President and Congress,
2:39:24
and things start to unfold, and as they unfold, even though you weren't
2:39:28
central to it, how did you see
2:39:32
the reactions to successes and failures, and problems that were coming up with
2:39:40
how the plan was being implemented?
2:39:42
How did you see the culture or the dynamic, the institutional
2:39:46
reactive mechanisms to this?
2:39:50
Well, you saw resentment for the scientists who'd put the plan together.
2:39:57
When you went and talked to the head F.S. [National Forest-level] folks
2:40:02
about the difficulty they were having in trying to implement this, because
2:40:06
they were just being sued right and left, or the impossibility that you've
2:40:12
placed for them [administrative, management-wise, logistical]
2:40:14
. You're talking about like in the Matrix lands and the other lands
2:40:16
where they thought that they were
2:40:19
going to make up for the losses in the reserves, and then they were being sued,
2:40:23
everything was just piling up, right?
2:40:25
Right.
2:40:25
I worked on various New Perspective [Forest Service program ca.] studies
2:40:29
to see if we could do various types of New Forestry [forest management
2:40:35
concepts from Jerry Franklin] prescriptions to harvest and create
2:40:38
a landscape mosaic within the Matrix
2:40:44
areas.
2:40:44
I worked on a couple of those studies.
2:40:47
I managed the station's effort to look at “Compatible Forestry,” a
2:40:53
program advocated and funded by PNW Station Director Tom Mills.
2:40:54
We don't manage just for timber, you manage for a whole suite of things.
2:40:59
How can you manage compatibly?
2:41:01
Because all the discussions always talk like you're only managing for two
2:41:04
things, say, environmental goods, and on this axis, you've got timber, and
2:41:09
every guy just draws a line like this.
2:41:11
They think they're always at those points on the line.
2:41:13
But if you think about it, almost all the time you're inside there
2:41:16
somewhere where you could move with either mutual gains, or you could
2:41:20
move keeping, say, timber steady and improve environmental [outcomes] . You
2:41:25
know, because policymakers are thinking of it as a two-dimensional problem.
2:41:29
And, being a modeler, you know that no matter how good the model,
2:41:36
it will always be incomplete compared to the complexity of reality.
2:41:40
Yeah.
2:41:41
And is that?
2:41:42
Yeah, that's a fair statement.
2:41:43
Yeah.
2:41:44
But,
2:41:50
all of the Northwest Forest Plan money went to other people.
2:41:55
Being an economist, working on incentives, the only money that
2:41:59
we got is for some community work.
2:42:01
So, I did social science work.
2:42:06
We did stuff that paid the bills.
2:42:10
I was assigned to the TLMP team, the Tongass Land Management Plan.
2:42:15
Did their demand projections.
2:42:17
Worked in the Chugach [National] Forest Plan.
2:42:20
Worked on the Interior Columbia Basin Project for eight years.
2:42:24
What else did I do?
2:42:29
Eventually, fire research came along.
2:42:33
We had to do fire research.
2:42:36
After 1995-96,
2:42:43
the Northwest Forest Plan wasn't a big driver of economics research.
2:42:49
We got gold stars for being the closest on the job impacts.
2:42:53
That's not a very good gold star.
2:42:58
Describe why it wasn't a good gold star.
2:43:00
We
2:43:02
estimated pretty close to the impact of what the job loss would be.
2:43:07
Do you think that the people that pushed this through, the center of
2:43:12
energy, do you think they really had any idea of the reality of what would
2:43:18
happen over time, say 10-20 years?
2:43:21
I mean, do you think they were naïve or, shall we say, idealistically
2:43:26
optimistic, in a sense that--?
2:43:29
I think it would be polite to say they were idealistically optimistic.
2:43:33
I had to go to Europe in 2004.
2:43:35
I won
2:43:39
a prize and I had some extra money, so I took some of my program members
2:43:44
and called in all my European favors.
2:43:48
We went on a "show me" trip for two weeks.
2:43:52
We had to give seminars; that was what we traded.
2:43:58
I can remember in Sweden, people just being stunned that the U.S. would
2:44:04
make a policy-decision, essentially to impoverish a whole region.
2:44:10
They couldn't see that, because in their world, “we” [Swedes]
2:44:15
practice sustainable forestry.
2:44:19
They have a mix of community forest and privately-owned forest,
2:44:22
and not much public forest.
2:44:27
You wouldn't make a public policy decision [Sweden] that impoverished a whole region.
2:44:32
They had a hard time seeing that, especially my statement about it
2:44:38
costing Americans about a pizza dinner [each] , but all the impact is born,
2:44:42
really, in a relatively small area.
2:44:45
Also, you've got Sweden, a country that is smaller than the Northwest.
2:44:51
Yeah, but--
2:44:51
So, you can look at it, it's almost like they are a region
2:44:55
in terms of size, economically.
2:44:59
But they couldn't understand why a government would do
2:45:04
that.
2:45:04
I understand.
2:45:04
I'm just trying to find comparatives.
2:45:05
Yeah, there's only eight million of them.
2:45:07
There's eight million Oregonians and Washingtonians, actually.
2:45:10
And I'm not trying to belittle the Swedes, the European countries.
2:45:11
But think about that.
2:45:15
I'm just trying to do a comparative analogy.
2:45:17
But think about that.
2:45:20
They couldn't understand that you would manage public lands,
2:45:26
essentially the high ICUN categories, and why would you do that.
2:45:32
These are highly-productive timber lands.
2:45:37
Well, I have a theory.
2:45:42
The pendulum swing reaction is that you see in the '90s
2:45:46
and through the present, is
2:45:50
a pendulum swing over-reaction to the excesses of previous generations,
2:45:55
where there was a thing going on there that wasn't sustainable,
2:46:01
and then, the hammer came down and it came down perhaps too hard.
2:46:07
Well, I think you could be right, but it's better to think about what are
2:46:10
the objectives that the Forest Service has had, that have been assigned to
2:46:15
it, or that they've advocated for.
2:46:19
We started off with Gifford Pinchot, the “greatest good for the greatest number,”
2:46:23
but we really didn't harvest very much.
2:46:28
The harvest was mostly on private lands and we were conserving timber.
2:46:33
Then the Sustained Yield Act passed , we're going to manage
2:46:37
these forests sustainably.
2:46:39
And post-World War II came and the cut was rising on public lands, national
2:46:46
forest cut was rising too rapidly actually as people eroded stands.
2:46:52
And we got the Multiple Use Act because folks became concerned.
2:46:59
When did the first, the Wilderness Act, passed in, what, 1962, '64?
2:47:01
1964. [Political process lasted from 1956 to 1964]
2:47:07
Early advocates of that were looking at early Forest Service
2:47:12
efforts to develop primitive areas.
2:47:24
Then in the '90s, you're talking about a changing of objectives.
2:47:27
Our land management objectives reflected broad societal goals.
2:47:32
We live in a society that doesn't need and doesn’t want us to harvest
2:47:41
for the couple billion cubic feet we used to harvest every year.
2:47:45
And so, we now harvest a couple billion cubic feet every five years.
2:47:52
It's the land management goals.
2:47:54
At the same time, one of the things that's going on in the background that
2:47:59
no one else will tell you is that when I went to school, we were trained to
2:48:06
talk about the “New Forestry.” A study had just come out called the “South's
2:48:10
Third Forest.” It said that the forest we're planting today is vastly different
2:48:16
than anything we've had here before.
2:48:19
It grows faster, you have better quality, smaller hardwood
2:48:22
proportions, and it's manageable.
2:48:26
In the 1980's, I worked on the “South's Fourth Forest” study. In that study,
2:48:32
we had data from these stands that people were just glimpsing when
2:48:37
the “Third Forest Study” was done.
2:48:39
Based on
2:48:42
those data, we said that we're going to get fifteen percent more
2:48:47
yield from these managed stands.
2:48:51
And I did the 2000 RPA, we actually had real data, we were getting fifty
2:48:56
percent more growth from those stands.
2:49:00
Essentially, between the mid-'90s and 2005, we saw the transition in the U.S.,
2:49:07
where the bulk of timber used here used to come from natural stands, and by 2005,
2:49:12
the bulk now came from managed stands.
2:49:15
Those managed stands are only 50 million acres out of 500 million acres.
2:49:20
So, we've shifted the bulk of harvest away from natural stands
2:49:25
sort of scattered all over.
2:49:26
To plantations, essentially?
2:49:28
To plantations, essentially.
2:49:30
What is the percentage that's coming out of the Northwest the
2:49:32
last twenty years, in terms of national production, national output?
2:49:37
We should be factual.
2:49:46
Richard is going to look for a
2:49:50
book.
2:49:50
He's got a book, that's got a lot of--
2:49:57
I'm looking for harvest by owner,
2:50:01
history and projections.
2:50:02
Analysis of the Timber Situation in the United States, 1952 to 2015.
2:50:07
This is the book we're talking about [for readers]
2:50:09
. This is the 2000 RPA Timber Assessment.
2:50:14
I could go get the 2005, it would have slightly more recent data;
2:50:19
harvest by region, harvest by owner.
2:50:23
Why don't you turn that off for a minute?
2:50:24
Okay.
2:50:25
While I look.
2:50:26
Okay, we're back on the record there.
2:50:28
Richard's going to--
2:50:30
Historically, the west side [Cascades’ crest westward to Pacific
2:50:32
Ocean] accounted for almost thirty percent of U.S. timber harvest.
2:50:36
But after the owl, it dropped down to about fifteen percent.
2:50:40
So, it was a dramatic decrease.
2:50:42
Yes.
2:50:45
Now, we still have a large forest products industry here, and it's
2:50:48
still very large mills which further complicates the problem, because the
2:50:53
little neighborhood mills are all gone.
2:50:55
They're the ones that took the brunt of it because they didn't
2:50:57
have the economies of scale or the leverage to survive the downswings.
2:51:01
Right.
2:51:02
And the industry that's here now is less diverse than the industry that was here
2:51:07
in the 1980's, even in the recession.
2:51:07
The implication of that is, industries
2:51:15
that are very similar can only pay the same amount for stumpage.
2:51:20
In the past, we were able to sell timber, or you could hope a specialty mill would
2:51:25
show up, or somebody that made plywood.
2:51:28
You had a plywood producer competing against a lumber producer.
2:51:31
But now, they're all lumber producers and they produce the same kind of lumber.
2:51:37
Now, there's another anecdote, and this affects Weyerhaeuser.
2:51:42
Following the price spike in 1993,
2:51:48
lumber became very expensive.
2:51:51
So, people had to look for substitutes.
2:51:52
And what they found were the little wooden I-beams.
2:51:55
These had been invented earlier.
2:51:57
So, instead of cutting a 12-inch board to use as a joist, you can
2:52:03
use the little wooden I-beam.
2:52:05
Laminated?
2:52:06
A laminated, they've got like a--
2:52:08
And they're stronger.
2:52:09
It's stronger and it doesn't squeak.
2:52:12
When prices dropped back down, consumers didn't switch back.
2:52:16
So, Weyerhaeuser's stuck with all these stands that they had been managing to cut
2:52:21
for what they called the “wide market.”
2:52:23
The big stuff?
2:52:24
The big stuff, 12-inch stuff out of it.
2:52:28
To cut a 12-inch board, you've got to have like a 14 or 16-inch top.
2:52:31
Right.
2:52:32
Well, suddenly, they don't need any of that.
2:52:36
So,
2:52:38
they exported that, or they cut, used it up.
2:52:42
Now, you don't need to manage stands for 40-45 years, you can manage
2:52:46
west-side stands for 25-30 years.
2:52:50
They get big enough logs to do the laminating and small beams.
2:52:53
Right?
2:52:53
Right.
2:52:53
And they're cutting 2-by-4's, you're cutting two-inch dimension lumber.
2:52:58
You know, twos, fours, maybe some sixes, and you can still cut them long
2:53:04
here and run a 32-foot, I mean, we can still grow a 32-foot log in one
2:53:09
tree, and still have a good six-inch, 6-8-inch top on that log in 35 years.
2:53:17
So, essentially, one consequence of the spotted owl was to change the
2:53:22
lumber market such that we're going to shorten rotations on private land.
2:53:26
So, you'll get a further separation between public land and private land,
2:53:31
and you reduce the opportunities to sell timber from the public lands.
2:53:36
Do you think we're going to have a swing back in the other direction because
2:53:39
of the political situation in this country, where certain interest groups
2:53:46
not afraid to seemingly go really far are going to try to take things in a
2:53:51
certain direction, or do you think that that ship [back to pre-environmental age
2:53:54
ethic and practices] has come and sailed?
2:53:56
I think it's sailed.
2:53:58
I have
2:54:02
often thought that, as the demographics of the U.S. changed and minority populations
2:54:09
grew, the environmental community is mostly white upper-middle class, the
2:54:16
declining part of the population.
2:54:18
So, if there's going to be a change, it'll be a change as political
2:54:22
power shifts to, say, this other community, which is less well-off
2:54:28
and they may want, say, more housing.
2:54:32
They may be willing to make tradeoffs that the people currently in power,
2:54:38
the white upper-middle class, won't.
2:54:40
But I can't say that out too loud because you're getting into the social
2:54:43
part of sustainable development.
2:54:45
But traditionally, minority communities, at least in the last, well, quite
2:54:50
a bit of time, if you want to talk about environmental issues, they're
2:54:55
more concerned with social justice issues in terms of how pollution and
2:55:00
other things affect where they live.
2:55:02
Right, where they live.
2:55:03
In terms of the NIMBY dynamic because they are in the back yard of a lot of industry.
2:55:07
Right.
2:55:09
Which is different than, like you said, the white or upper-middle class,
2:55:13
the conservation/environmentalist elite, who have a much more
2:55:17
preservation-oriented urban perspective.
2:55:20
Right.
2:55:21
No, I think they're changing.
2:55:22
It will come.
2:55:24
It will come slowly.
2:55:25
I'm not exactly sure what that means, given that with forest management we have
2:55:32
an industry here which has sized itself to operate off of private timber lands.
2:55:37
Mostly, this is a region of large contiguous blocks of
2:55:41
well-managed private timber land.
2:55:45
And then the U.S. South.
2:55:48
Places that depend on, like the Rockies, where we'd like to sell more timber,
2:55:55
but it's natural stands, a lot of bug kill, that's really difficult.
2:56:00
Economically difficult.
2:56:02
Economically difficult.
2:56:03
So, you won't be able to do the restoration forestry that the
2:56:06
silviculturalists would like to see.
2:56:09
Remember, the timber sale contract is still the only legal
2:56:13
way, unless it's a stewardship contract, that we can sell timber.
2:56:18
Because it's the people's property.
2:56:19
It's the people's property.
2:56:21
We're required by law to make fair market value.
2:56:24
And since I work on timber appraisal stuff, I can tell you that somebody's
2:56:28
going to sue us pretty soon over whether we're getting fair market value or not.
2:56:33
It would be an easy way to stop timber sales.
2:56:37
So, what do you think is going to happen?
2:56:43
In your view, if the spotted owl and the Dwyer decision, FEMAT, and the Northwest
2:56:49
Forest Plan, had never happened, and let's say they'd slogged along with the
2:56:53
Forest Management Act of '76 and whatever they did with that, where do you think
2:56:58
we'd be today, if that had just been allowed to play out without all this
2:57:01
other high-profile, dramatic stuff?
2:57:04
Well, the national forest harvest would probably be twice what it is currently.
2:57:10
You think we'd be up close to what the level might have been
2:57:13
--? No.
2:57:16
It dropped ninety percent.
2:57:17
You know, it would have dropped to, say, fifty percent.
2:57:19
Okay.
2:57:21
That was imbedded in the plan, the standards and guides.
2:57:24
So, there was expectations that it was going to decrease anyway?
2:57:28
Right, that was George Leonard's big decision.
2:57:32
The spotted owl got blamed for a lot of stuff.
2:57:35
Well, it's an easy target.
2:57:37
It was.
2:57:37
And yeah, with a lot of legal justification.
2:57:42
But the forest planners were going to drop harvest on the west side, regardless.
2:57:49
So, what did you learn about doing your work on the east side that
2:57:53
relates to what we're just talking about right now, on the west side?
2:57:56
I mean, you kind of led into that, but maybe a little more elaboration.
2:58:00
Well, on the east side
2:58:04
there were a couple important lessons.
2:58:06
First
2:58:09
off, there
2:58:12
was no species as compelling as the spotted owl.
2:58:15
In other words, charismatic, etc., etc.
2:58:17
Yeah, there are wolves, there's grizzlies, there's sockeye salmon.
2:58:23
There are lots of them, but
2:58:26
often, they're uniquely located.
2:58:30
It's also an area the size of France.
2:58:33
It's huge.
2:58:35
And with very few people in it.
2:58:41
The east, you're talking about?
2:58:42
Yeah, the east side.
2:58:45
You know, the whole state of Oregon, the whole of eastern
2:58:48
Oregon doesn't have enough people to be a congressional district.
2:58:51
Walden has to represent some folks over on the west side, too.
2:58:55
Yeah, I know.
2:58:58
But, the State of Washington, on the other hand, has—there's as many people
2:59:02
in Spokane as in all of eastern Oregon.
2:59:04
By far, many more.
2:59:07
Yeah, eastern Washington actually has some people in it, but not many.
2:59:10
And you've even got the Tri-Cities down there in the south, too.
2:59:12
Yeah, you've got the Tri-Cities.
2:59:13
[Kennewick, Richland, Pasco]
2:59:15
Also Wenatchee and Yakima and all that.
2:59:15
So it's [Oregon] a much more rural area.
2:59:21
It's also an area where you can see the American frontier re-emerging.
2:59:25
The American frontier, as defined as six people or fewer per square mile.
2:59:30
That's from the 1890 Census.
2:59:31
The old Frederick Jackson term, the famous “frontier thesis.”
2:59:36
We see areas where the frontier is returning,
2:59:41
where you have issues of capacity and resilience and as well as those about
2:59:48
developing community leadership there, and what role do public lands play in that.
2:59:53
The questions were much more fascinating, and people there were willing to try to
2:59:59
add things up to very broad measures.
3:00:01
We had goals of trying to maintain ecological integrity, or trying to
3:00:08
maintain social and economic resiliency.
3:00:12
I learned that biophysical scientists liked the concept of integrity, and in
3:00:18
their world view, a system has integrity when it's in its steady-state equilibrium.
3:00:25
If a system gets disturbed, let's say, you have a very broad fire,
3:00:29
you've disturbed that, so the question is, how fast does that return
3:00:33
back to this steady-state world?
3:00:37
This really comes from the aquatic literature.
3:00:39
There is a guy named [James] Karr, who defined aquatic integrity.
3:00:43
On the east side, we actually tried to have objectives for ecosystem
3:00:46
management, different than the west side.
3:00:49
The west side, remember; FEMAT is a connected habitat conservation strategy
3:00:55
for two species, salmon and owls.
3:00:59
On the east side, we actually tried to do ecosystem management with objectives
3:01:04
and a framework that laid this out.
3:01:06
Surprisingly, that was insisted on by Jack Thomas, who I think understood
3:01:13
the shortages on the short-falling on the west side on FEMAT because
3:01:21
he couldn't communicate what it was.
3:01:25
But people said, "Well, this looks like ecosystem management."
3:01:27
Everybody picked up on that.
3:01:30
But on the east side, he said, "Be deliberate. Have a framework that lays out
3:01:36
your objectives and how you achieve it."
3:01:41
So, on the east side, it was designed to deal with how you manage the lands
3:01:47
to achieve ecological integrity, or to improve ecological integrity
3:01:51
and social and economic resiliency.
3:01:53
It had two dual goals, a biophysical and a social and economic goal.
3:01:59
I think one of the key differences is that economics and the culture of
3:02:06
“big forests” were much more intense than you would find on the east side.
3:02:11
You had a lot more space to develop something like that on the east side.
3:02:14
Do you get my point about that political and cultural space?
3:02:17
Well, there are only a couple places timber plays a big role.
3:02:20
You have a forest over there where you have a huge grazing program.
3:02:23
You have long-standing minerals there.
3:02:27
Most people perceive the forests are also at the headwaters of their streams.
3:02:31
People live down in the valleys.
3:02:35
Wildlife was important, both for viewing and for hunting.
3:02:39
It
3:02:42
wasn't that it was balanced, it was just more balanced.
3:02:45
It wasn't dominated by the timber.
3:02:47
You still had big timber producers.
3:02:48
You've got Potlatch [Lumber Co.] sitting there in La Grande.
3:02:52
Up in northern Idaho there's a cluster of manufacturing.
3:02:55
Missoula [Montana] has a lot of manufacturing.
3:02:57
Is there a Hines mill that is still operating on the eastern side?
3:03:00
Not any more.
3:03:01
Not anymore, I didn't think so.
3:03:03
The Burns one's [mill] gone, right?
3:03:04
Right.
3:03:05
Hines had some kind of special contract they operated till the end of the
3:03:09
contract, and then, they disappeared early in one of the recessions.
3:03:13
In Klamath Falls, there's not too much going on down there, anyway.
3:03:16
They're still milling there.
3:03:18
Yeah, there's some milling.
3:03:20
You still have a sawmill, and there's still one in Madras or Prineville.
3:03:27
I also think John Day still has a mill -- used to have four or five.
3:03:32
Doesn't Warm Springs [Indian Reservation] have one?
3:03:34
It just closed.
3:03:35
They closed, gave up.
3:03:37
Their problem had more to do with management, I think.
3:03:42
They gambled they could put in a waste fuel boiler to generate power.
3:03:48
In short, they put in a very sophisticated boiler and thought they
3:03:52
were going to gather wood waste, say, from Portland or anywhere, take it and
3:03:56
generate power, but it didn't work.
3:04:00
You can't put out that kind of smoke.
3:04:06
You run into air quality issues.
3:04:10
They got stopped.
3:04:12
But the east side, it came to an end when the Clinton administration
3:04:19
left, and Bush came in and said we're not going to do that type
3:04:24
of planning, broadscale planning.
3:04:28
And we all got a paper weight and went home.
3:04:40
Not many people were involved in the Timber Wars as long as I was.
3:04:44
A lot of them came only for FEMAT.
3:04:48
Right.
3:04:49
And it changed their world because it made them see their science.
3:04:53
For some of them, it
3:04:58
was the first time they felt important.
3:05:00
I know that's the case for the social scientists, since I managed them.
3:05:04
It was the first time they'd gotten to the table in a significant way.
3:05:06
Validation is important, although sometimes you can make too much
3:05:10
of it in terms of your sense of self-importance, is what I'm saying.
3:05:14
Yeah.
3:05:15
I'm not saying anything about any person or anything.
3:05:17
I think that you're talking about a social dynamic that's kind
3:05:20
of human nature, shall we say.
3:05:22
Yeah.
3:05:23
It was human nature.
3:05:26
Some people milked it, took the money and didn't deliver.
3:05:32
A lot of our scientists did that.
3:05:34
They
3:05:38
sort of like got their mouths on the tits first, like a bunch of piglets.
3:05:44
And they sucked it dry without really doing much, just
3:05:48
doing more of the same stuff.
3:05:51
Now, regarding the monitoring, first, I want you to talk in general about the
3:05:59
monitoring efforts since 1995, but also specifically, about variations you have
3:06:07
seen within the traditional economies that
3:06:12
have been impacted by this.
3:06:15
What are the ones that have succeeded, and what are the ones that have just withered
3:06:18
away and died, or just really struggled?
3:06:22
Regarding the monitoring program as a whole, what’s your opinion
3:06:24
of how it's been designed and implemented, but also economically,
3:06:33
if you want to maybe use a couple examples, variations within the matrix of
3:06:39
economies reliant on federal timber lands.
3:06:43
What were the ones that have adapted, what are the ones that haven't, what
3:06:46
mitigation measures have been tried?
3:06:48
If you want to just kind of talk about that cluster of
3:06:51
things I just threw your way.
3:06:54
Okay.
3:06:56
Are we on the record?
3:06:57
Yes.
3:06:57
We're on.
3:06:59
Okay.
3:07:02
Well, I was responsible for the economic monitoring and became
3:07:07
responsible for the social side, too.
3:07:10
The community monitoring.
3:07:11
All right.
3:07:12
One of the first things we did is that
3:07:18
we got into a disagreement about the number of communities.
3:07:24
People wanted you to monitor and worry about their favorite communities.
3:07:28
Everybody wants to worry about Coos Bay.
3:07:33
So, we put together an effort to try to identify the number of communities.
3:07:38
It turns out there were about 1,200 communities in the owl region.
3:07:45
And you have to ask yourself, which ones do you worry about?
3:07:49
Which ones are the least resilient, the least able to handle change?
3:07:58
That caused us to have a disagreement with the state.
3:08:01
The State of Oregon wants you to worry about distressed communities.
3:08:04
They do that on counties, looking at counties with high
3:08:08
unemployment or something.
3:08:10
But we're dealing with counties that might traditionally have higher
3:08:14
unemployment, because of seasonal work.
3:08:16
People work in the summers and in the winter they ranch.
3:08:23
So, on the basis of employment statistics, it looks like high unemployment.
3:08:27
You have a ski area where people work in the winter, and in the
3:08:30
summer, they just screw around.
3:08:32
So, you had to understand that.
3:08:36
But the states wanted us to deal with distressed areas using
3:08:40
their traditional measures.
3:08:41
And we said that's not the way you measure community resiliency.
3:08:46
You measure it in some other way and then you try to assess it.
3:08:50
How would you define community resiliency as a concept?
3:08:55
There
3:08:58
are different definitions of it.
3:09:01
I was responsible for an early definition that dealt with wanting a
3:09:06
measure of economic diversity, because you're trying to address the economic
3:09:11
well-being part of community resilience.
3:09:14
The same principle that goes behind when you say you need to have
3:09:16
a balanced financial portfolio?
3:09:18
Yes.
3:09:18
Yeah, right.
3:09:20
You're looking at measures of civic leadership.
3:09:27
I think that was about it, the multiple measures of each of those types of things.
3:09:33
I forget, there's maybe another term or category.
3:09:37
And you'd try to assess these for all 1,200 communities.
3:09:41
That's what we tried to argue.
3:09:42
And we did.
3:09:43
We did an assessment.
3:09:46
We had a way to engage the sort of community status to that.
3:09:54
It meant that we were in constant sort of disagreement with like the states, who
3:09:59
wanted us to worry about distressed areas.
3:10:03
One time I almost had a second asshole chewed into me by the community
3:10:08
leaders of Coos Bay because I told them I wasn't going to worry about
3:10:13
Coos Bay because it was too big.
3:10:15
You have over 10,000 people, you've got community leadership,
3:10:19
you've got a resilient community.
3:10:21
You have diversity.
3:10:22
Yeah, you've got economic [diversity]
3:10:23
. And it's a very old community.
3:10:24
[s]
3:10:25
Right.
3:10:25
Just because you don't like what you've got, doesn't mean that
3:10:28
you're a low resilient community.
3:10:31
You're actually a high resilient community.
3:10:34
That you're here today arguing with me suggests that.
3:10:38
And it didn't go over big.
3:10:41
I can see that.
3:10:43
Instead, you need to worry about the Long Creeks; you have the
3:10:44
Mount Vernons in eastern Oregon.
3:10:44
They were places that--
3:10:44
Where is Long Creek?
3:10:45
It's
3:10:51
north of John Day.
3:10:52
It's in
3:10:55
the next valley over.
3:10:56
So it's really up in the sticks up there.
3:10:58
But it had a sawmill.
3:10:59
Yeah, I know where it is.
3:11:00
Is it in Gilliam [County]
3:11:00
? It's
3:11:03
in Grant County [Central-north part of eastern Oregon]
3:11:03
. Grant.
3:11:03
It's on the Grant and Umatilla.
3:11:05
[Boundary area between counties.]
3:11:05
Umatilla.
3:11:05
I think it's on the Grant County side.
3:11:07
Right.
3:11:10
But in those places there isn't a lot of options because there
3:11:13
isn't diversity to start with.
3:11:15
And if you lose the single leg, well, guess what?
3:11:19
Guess what?
3:11:20
Those are places you might have to “fight fires” differently.
3:11:23
You don't have a local response.
3:11:27
You start to think about how you manage lands.
3:11:31
Maybe those are areas that we ought to look at some special contracting provision
3:11:35
that limits [local participation] . One of the big revelations in restoration
3:11:39
forestry is you're offering stuff to the lowest bidder, not offering
3:11:43
stuff to a targeted group unless you--
3:11:46
Or the best bidder?
3:11:47
Or the best bidder.
3:11:48
In other words, that low-bid rule sometimes gets us in a lot of trouble.
3:11:51
Right,
3:11:54
because originally, they thought that in part, economic mitigation
3:11:58
is what will substitute restoration.
3:12:01
It would be the local loggers going to get the contracts [restoration] . Well,
3:12:03
no, it's going to be some person who's figured out how to do stuff, maybe from
3:12:07
western Washington, who is going to truck
3:12:13
the logs somewhere else, unless you design it such.
3:12:14
How can you stretch the contracting rules so you can serve local needs
3:12:21
and don't get the contracting officer and the line officer in trouble?
3:12:28
So, those were all sorts of lessons.
3:12:30
Also then,
3:12:32
there's the monitoring scale [question] of what scale do you monitor at?
3:12:36
And what is it that you are realistically capable of monitoring?
3:12:43
You can't monitor at the community level without doing survey work, and
3:12:49
social science survey work is just as expensive as anybody else's survey work.
3:12:54
And let me tell you that is right as a person, who, I'm not even
3:12:56
in the social sciences because historians are considered "tweeners."
3:13:00
Tweeners, yeah.
3:13:01
We're between humanities and social sciences, and sciences, and we
3:13:06
get even less funding and interest than the social sciences do.
3:13:09
Yeah.
3:13:09
It cost me just as much to keep a crew in the field for a week, and
3:13:17
people didn't want to pay for that.
3:13:20
To them, they wanted the information, but it demonstrated there was no
3:13:26
value in the information if they weren't willing to pay for it.
3:13:30
Instead, they'd go out and survey for some three-legged newt or something.
3:13:37
So, we did monitoring using secondary data.
3:13:41
We did get the states to provide us county-level data and which
3:13:45
turned out to be perfectly adequate for much of the monitoring.
3:13:50
It turned out we had done economic monitoring for years at higher
3:13:53
scales, we just had to adjust the scales down because that had been
3:13:58
part of the work we had done.
3:13:59
If you were going to characterize the last twenty years in a two or three-paragraph
3:14:04
sound bite, how would you do that?
3:14:07
In regards to what?
3:14:09
The economics, the monitoring data, the resilience thing, if you were
3:14:12
going to give me a sound bite.
3:14:17
Perhaps it's unfair to call it a sound bite.
3:14:21
What we discovered was that most people lived in economically-resilient
3:14:29
communities.
3:14:32
But area-wise, it was a different story.
3:14:35
There were vast areas that had communities that were not resilient.
3:14:41
You could think of them as brittle, not adaptable to change.
3:14:47
What I'm saying is that there are many places that are rural communities
3:14:51
that are very small service centers.
3:14:55
Look at where Les Schwab has tire dealerships as an indicator, where
3:14:59
are there regional service centers.
3:15:01
Right.
3:15:04
Critical masses in various areas.
3:15:07
The reason why that's important is if you're going to have local fire crews, if
3:15:11
you're going to have, say, people who own equipment, how many construction crews
3:15:17
can you have, if you want to build a road somewhere or close a road, where is
3:15:21
that [tire service] going to come from?
3:15:29
So, that's what we learned.
3:15:32
I think that was a huge breakthrough; to move the timber-dependent
3:15:39
community’s discussion to
3:15:43
about communities of high social resiliency, and what are their
3:15:47
characteristics relative to communities of low resiliency.
3:15:50
We should target actions such that we either mitigate in those lower resilience
3:15:55
communities or that we don't impact them, because they're being impacted already.
3:16:01
Those would be the communities that you see in the news about the
3:16:06
“backwater” [forgotten] America, the opioid epidemic, the despair?
3:16:10
Yeah, but we're also--
3:16:11
Or is that, yeah?
3:16:12
There's some of that here.
3:16:13
But at the same time, some communities that are being overwhelmed are being
3:16:18
changed by the in-migration of retirees.
3:16:23
Think of Medford and Central Point.
3:16:25
If you have enough money, live in Los Angeles, have enough money,
3:16:29
and you want to retire north, you're going to go to Ashland.
3:16:33
Right.
3:16:34
But Ashland's pretty picky about who they let in.
3:16:36
So, if you're an ordinary Joe, you're going to go to Medford,
3:16:39
Central Point, or Grants Pass.
3:16:41
Think of how those areas are growing.
3:16:44
And all of those, not Ashland, but the others, were all timber-dependent
3:16:49
communities in the 1977 definition.
3:16:52
They're something else today.
3:16:54
And we see the same thing happening on the east side where you have
3:16:56
what's called "ranchette-ing."
3:17:00
People retire early, and if they have good health, they want to live the dream.
3:17:05
Get forty acres, put a double-wide on it and a horse barn, and live the dream.
3:17:11
That's ranchette-ing.
3:17:12
Well, if you're in Walla Walla, you'll get a vineyard.
3:17:17
But basically, what you're saying is, it's the same thing
3:17:19
that happens in New York City.
3:17:20
You're seeing the gentrification of rural America.
3:17:22
Yes.
3:17:23
In a dispersed, multi-faceted kind of way.
3:17:28
And that's happening here.
3:17:29
The Walla Walla area is one.
3:17:31
Think of Bend, the Bend-Redmond area.
3:17:34
Especially Bend, yeah.
3:17:36
Sisters, the triangle, gentrified, ranchette-ed.
3:17:37
It is a gentrification.
3:17:43
You can predict where that's going to happen.
3:17:45
It's got to have an airport.
3:17:48
It would be really great if the airport had jet service;
3:17:51
Horizon can only do so much.
3:17:52
Walla Walla's got an airport, the Tri Cities have an airport.
3:17:56
Actually, there's airports all over eastern Washington.
3:17:59
Eastern Oregon's another story.
3:18:01
Pendleton and Klamath and Redmond are the three airports.
3:18:08
Bend doesn't have an airport?
3:18:09
No.
3:18:10
Just a small little regional one?
3:18:12
No.
3:18:13
You fly into Redmond.
3:18:14
Really?
3:18:17
Being in Eugene, I've never flown to Bend, so I did not know.
3:18:20
They might have their own private aviation airport.
3:18:23
Yeah, right.
3:18:23
But commercial aviation flies into Redmond.
3:18:26
And in the summer, Alaska is smart enough to have a direct flight
3:18:30
from San Francisco to Redmond.
3:18:33
I did not know that.
3:18:35
Well, if you look at how immigration and migration works,
3:18:42
the airports play a big role.
3:18:46
They're all old military airports.
3:18:49
The Pendleton airport is where the B-25 Mitchells [WWII medium bomber] practiced
3:18:56
takeoffs and landing because there's a drop-off at the end of the runway.
3:18:59
Oh, so.
3:19:00
Walla Walla's an old B-17 base.
3:19:02
Huge, huge runway.
3:19:04
The airport just uses a little corner.
3:19:07
It's a huge triangular-shaped thing.
3:19:12
And Madras, or Redmond, is an old military airport that is
3:19:16
also a Forest Service fire base.
3:19:21
I want to go back and ask
3:19:22
-- I want to go back and add a comment about the east side and the
3:19:25
Interior Columbia Basin Project.
3:19:27
One of the things that this project made the scientists do,
3:19:29
is it made them measure things.
3:19:34
Until then, we could just argue that this is better, that this watershed
3:19:39
is better than that watershed.
3:19:41
But when we got to the Interior Columbia Basin Project, we had to develop measures.
3:19:48
At first, there were scientists that were utterly resistant to that.
3:19:53
But then a fellow named Danny Lee came and worked with them, and he helped them
3:20:00
understand that it's not an absolute measure, it's just an ordinal measure.
3:20:05
You ranked things from best to your worst, and the top third are your really good
3:20:10
guys, the middle third are your average, and the bottom third, is below average.
3:20:16
That would be sufficient.
3:20:18
And that was a revelation to them.
3:20:21
After that, they were able to rank all their watersheds.
3:20:23
I think they had 163 watersheds, so they ranked all their watersheds and assessed
3:20:29
them on their ecological integrity.
3:20:31
The best ones, the top third, had good ecological integrity.
3:20:36
I think that was a real breakthrough.
3:20:39
It showed it was possible to do that.
3:20:42
So, it was one of the accomplishments.
3:20:45
Now, in the Interior Columbia Basin Project, we started to suffer the
3:20:48
same accusations being made against FEMAT about it being ad-hoc science.
3:20:53
And also, a closed-door, non-open session.
3:20:58
Because in session, that's what FEMAT was for a period of time,
3:21:01
it was a cloister of scientists, with the public not looking in.
3:21:06
Right.
3:21:06
And the Interior Columbia Basin Project was an open process.
3:21:10
Okay.
3:21:10
But it still got the criticism?
3:21:12
It still got criticism.
3:21:13
But at first, people could wander in anytime.
3:21:16
And then it became like a “science week.” One week a month, we would
3:21:21
have meetings with the public, sort of like show-and-tell with the public.
3:21:28
There was an agenda and various people would come.
3:21:33
One time we organized a debate between different proponents of what's called
3:21:37
the second income theory, about how public lands are generating
3:21:43
and attracting people who come and bring economic activity with them.
3:21:47
We had several proponents and opponents to come to speak, and we'd
3:21:52
have a couple hundred people show up.
3:21:55
It was an open process, but still, the science community, we were
3:21:58
being criticized because it appeared to be doing “ad-hoc science.”
3:22:02
So, what we did is we got an agreement with Forest Ecology and Management, a
3:22:10
well-respected journal, for a special issue, and we put together a special
3:22:14
issue to highlight all of our science.
3:22:17
We had the scientists write 10-12 articles explaining the science, and there were
3:22:23
a couple articles that were difficult to get through the review process.
3:22:27
We had to have independent reviewers.
3:22:29
But it did reassure everyone that we were doing good science, at least science that
3:22:36
would stand the scrutiny of its peers.
3:22:38
And FEMAT never did that.
3:22:40
They did it in bits and pieces, but never as a whole.
3:22:46
Okay, that's what I wanted to add.
3:22:47
[End of Part]
3:22:47
[Start of Part]
3:22:47
Schmieding: That's very good.
3:22:51
Now, what do you think is the most important reason for having created and
3:22:55
implemented the Northwest Forest Plan?
3:22:58
I mean, what are the most important lessons learned from
3:23:02
that, both successes and failures?
3:23:06
And what have we learned from this process regarding proactive management as well as
3:23:11
the human limitations on managing nature?
3:23:17
And you've got to throw a little code up at the barred owl in there, too.
3:23:22
[Laughs] It's a human limitations thing.
3:23:25
Well, I guess, the process for changing land management objectives
3:23:32
for public lands, especially national forest lands, is not a smooth process.
3:23:39
It's not set by the agency itself.
3:23:43
The agency contributed to the first couple sets of objectives, but in this
3:23:48
particular case, it was society-at-large.
3:23:53
You could argue that it was done in a clumsy fashion using the Endangered
3:23:57
Species Act, but the Endangered Species Act was decided on as a societal goal.
3:24:05
This is an implementation of that goal.
3:24:09
It changed our land management objectives without really having that debate.
3:24:16
At the time it was not avoidable.
3:24:19
You could see it coming, from the mid-'80s through to the Dwyer injunction.
3:24:26
You could see, sort of like Tetris [game/process of arranging shapes
3:24:30
in various orders to achieve some goal] , like the blocks kept
3:24:31
falling more and more and more.
3:24:32
There was a critical mass and you knew there was going to be a climax,
3:24:35
and something was going to happen?
3:24:37
Yes, you could see it coming.
3:24:39
If you didn't see it coming, it was because you weren't paying attention.
3:24:44
But, I saw it coming.
3:24:49
I think the lesson I learned from it had to do with what we talked
3:24:55
about before, that we essentially developed a plan, or FEMAT developed
3:24:59
a plan, that was not implementable.
3:25:02
It did not take into account the incentives that land managers see.
3:25:07
They just see a bunch of standards and guides, and that's
3:25:10
what they're going to follow.
3:25:12
If you think about it, that's why they're selected.
3:25:14
These are people who can follow a process, implement process, they’re
3:25:18
people motivated to follow a process.
3:25:19
They're not innovators?
3:25:21
They're not selected for that.
3:25:23
They're administrators.
3:25:24
They're followers.
3:25:25
People who can work process.
3:25:28
Right.
3:25:29
Yeah.
3:25:29
I think if they call them administrators, you know, it belittles them because
3:25:35
some of these people are very good.
3:25:38
They see a problem, they understand how you get there, and they can manage a
3:25:44
diverse group of people towards that.
3:25:45
But they were hamstrung by certain things?
3:25:47
Yeah.
3:25:49
They're extremely risk averse.
3:25:51
We didn't understand that because in the science community we have
3:25:54
screwy attitudes about risk.
3:25:59
And I think you already partly answered this, but do you think
3:26:03
that the Northwest Forest Plan process was kind of a one-shot deal?
3:26:08
In other words, it's not something that you can transfer to another biome or
3:26:13
another region or even another country?
3:26:16
It's not transferable.
3:26:17
You talked about Sweden, for instance, that's why I'm saying it.
3:26:19
It's not transferable.
3:26:23
It's a strange situation of where you have public lands, and somebody in
3:26:27
Pittsburgh has as much right to say what happens on the Willamette National Forest
3:26:30
as somebody in Sweet Home, and there's just a lot more people in Pittsburgh.
3:26:34
Right, exactly.
3:26:36
That was another hard lesson I had to explain to folks.
3:26:40
Repeat that again a little, or clarify that point a little more?
3:26:42
Somebody in Pittsburgh has as much right to what happens on the
3:26:45
Willamette as somebody in Sweet Home.
3:26:48
I was giving a talk in Sweet Home one day.
3:26:50
I be they didn't like that very much, did they?
3:26:54
No, they didn't.
3:26:54
And there's a lot more people in Pittsburgh.
3:26:58
I know, that is one thing people [some rural constituencies]
3:27:00
have a hard time with.
3:27:02
In all the years I've done research and journalism in the West,
3:27:08
no matter how hard you try to talk to them about federal lands, as the
3:27:12
people's lands, the model of the U.S., the good parts [aspects] of federal
3:27:17
lands, etc., they often don't see it that way when they live there.
3:27:20
No.
3:27:22
They see it as some “big brother” thing in the distance that's
3:27:27
messing with their freedom.
3:27:28
And you could make an argument that said, in Europe when the kings owned
3:27:34
everything, you guys couldn't do anything.
3:27:37
You'd be these little serfs, feudal serfs over here, and
3:27:41
you couldn't do a darned thing.
3:27:42
And there are these problems here.
3:27:44
I understand a frustration with bureaucracy, but it’s best to pull
3:27:49
back and look at this thing like this [objective overview] . However,
3:27:51
it's hard to convince them of that.
3:27:53
It is.
3:27:57
When I do large fire cost reviews, the successful forest supervisors are those
3:28:03
who could instill a good neighbor policy.
3:28:06
Who can talk about how I'm fighting a fire on this side, because we
3:28:12
want to be good neighbors here, but I'm not going to fight the fire
3:28:14
over there because that's shifting resources from higher risk things.
3:28:20
They're able to communicate that.
3:28:24
When I talk about people who can follow a process, that's part of that.
3:28:27
It's being able to communicate their strategies.
3:28:31
But they're not going to be risk-takers.
3:28:34
Not going to be innovators.
3:28:37
We asked too much, but I think we were
3:28:48
naïve.
3:28:49
Okay, we're back on
3:28:53
now.
3:28:53
There wasn't a big cadre of economists, there was a small group of us.
3:28:59
And a couple people like Darius Adams, they were willing to do
3:29:03
the analysis, but they didn't
3:29:07
want to participate in the bickering stuff.
3:29:09
They didn't see the sense of that.
3:29:12
And there were a couple academics that were just the opposite, but
3:29:16
discredited themselves early on.
3:29:19
So, people wouldn't listen to them anymore.
3:29:22
It left very few of us.
3:29:24
And Brian Grieber, who did serve, he got disillusioned very quickly, and
3:29:29
after a few threats, he left OSU.
3:29:34
He got both disillusioned and he thought the Dean [OSU-COF] had
3:29:39
compromised him, and he left and went to work for Weyerhaeuser.
3:29:43
Was this back in the '90s?
3:29:45
Yeah, Weyerhaeuser offered me a job.
3:29:47
I turned it down and Brian took it.
3:29:52
Was that when [Carl] Stoltenberg was the dean?
3:29:54
Yeah, Stoltenberg was still the dean.
3:29:55
It was towards the end of his days.
3:29:57
Then, after the FEMAT summit and after he and I worked together on the FEMAT, there
3:30:06
was some ruckus, Brian got disillusioned, and Weyerhaeuser's pay looked really good.
3:30:15
Having thirty-two years with the Forest Service in the Northwest, how
3:30:19
would you describe the Forest Service culture here when you started, and
3:30:23
how did that change until you retired?
3:30:25
If you wanted to just kind of say, this is what I saw.
3:30:28
Well,
3:30:31
I have insights that you won't find elsewhere.
3:30:33
I did the last survey of the forest supervisors.
3:30:36
The forest supervisors have a series of surveys of them.
3:30:40
They have funny names like “Air Bird” and “Snow Bird,” and I
3:30:43
forget what ours was called.
3:30:48
The thing that surprised me about the change, when I came, it was a
3:30:51
male organization dominated by timber people, many of them military veterans.
3:30:56
These were people I recognized and you could relate to well.
3:31:03
Well, you had a military background.
3:31:05
Yeah.
3:31:05
And you went to a school [N.C. State] that was very regimented.
3:31:07
Right, I recognized them.
3:31:10
And you know, you could live with that.
3:31:13
But the thing that surprised me, as
3:31:20
we all started at the same time trying to diversify our work forces,
3:31:24
different both in discipline and gender in the early 1980's, the National
3:31:33
Forest System was far more successful.
3:31:37
They moved women and they moved minorities, they moved nontraditional
3:31:44
foresters into line officer positions where we never did before.
3:31:49
They were successful.
3:31:51
And the people they were hiring were highly-motivated.
3:31:54
It's not that the motivation changed or the adherence to Forest Services values
3:31:59
changed, they were just different.
3:32:01
They brought a different approach to the table.
3:32:03
And even in my thirty-two years, I had a program that went from
3:32:08
mostly male to where the women were in administrative positions.
3:32:12
They were the secretaries and the assistants [previously.]
3:32:13
To where two-thirds of my scientists were women.
3:32:17
So, I had to learn how to behave differently.
3:32:20
They communicated differently, they chatted more.
3:32:25
I couldn't grunt three times at them and they'd run off and do something.
3:32:28
I'd have to explain first, have to ask how they were, you'd explain
3:32:32
why this was important, what they could achieve with the outcomes.
3:32:37
They asked different questions.
3:32:38
They worked just as hard as men.
3:32:41
They'd stomp through the mud just like men.
3:32:45
I didn't notice any differences about that.
3:32:47
They lifted boards just as heavy.
3:32:51
We did utilization studies, social science field work, and economics.
3:32:57
I had a hard time getting women to be economists.
3:33:03
A couple of them complained, that it was very isolating.
3:33:05
They wanted to work with people, not numbers.
3:33:09
Claire was an exception.
3:33:11
Montgomery?
3:33:12
Yeah.
3:33:13
She was an exception even in the early days.
3:33:15
She's still there - is she retired from OSU now?
3:33:18
She's supposed to retire the end of this month.
3:33:20
Oh, okay.
3:33:21
I'll have to send her a note.
3:33:24
I tried to hire her one time.
3:33:27
But those are the changes I've noticed.
3:33:29
That it's not the sort of monolithic forestry organization that it
3:33:35
was when I first came, and I think that's for its betterment.
3:33:40
On the fire reviews, I've watched some female forest supervisors really explain
3:33:45
quite well to why they did things they did with the neighboring communities
3:33:52
because they're sensitive to that.
3:33:54
They worked ahead of time, rather than letting it be a crisis.
3:33:58
And
3:34:00
the old fire dogs seem to respect them for it.
3:34:03
The fire community's still mostly male.
3:34:06
Still today.
3:34:07
Yeah, but the fire management officers work for a forest supervisor.
3:34:13
So, we've definitely got more gender-integrated in the Forest Service,
3:34:20
but how about
3:34:25
the management and the objectives and the philosophy?
3:34:28
I mean, do you see disjointedness, disunity, or
3:34:30
do
3:34:33
you just see a new paradigm being more dominant than it was 35-40 years ago?
3:34:39
I see the Forest Service more adrift than ever over what are
3:34:44
their management objectives.
3:34:46
I'm working on a study trying to come up with a new starting point for timber
3:34:50
appraisals across the whole country.
3:34:55
When I talk to folks in the West, they're struggling with
3:35:01
this as a restoration strategy.
3:35:03
But it's a timber sale, how do I make this timber sale achieve the
3:35:09
objectives that are being set for it.
3:35:11
I see people struggling more than they need to.
3:35:15
And then the line officers pressuring them, well, we've got to sell
3:35:21
this.
3:35:21
It doesn't make any difference, how you value it, just get it so it sells
3:35:24
because that's part of a broader strategy.
3:35:28
And in cases like that, somebody's going to sue us over
3:35:30
the fair market value question.
3:35:32
Like you said earlier.
3:35:33
It's just, it's lurking in the wings.
3:35:36
And
3:35:38
so, I don't see the--
3:35:40
Where would that come from?
3:35:41
Who would be the interest group or that would be the most likely
3:35:45
candidate for being the litigant?
3:35:48
Well, the industry [forest] could be one, because they say, "Look, you guys
3:35:52
are giving junky stuff away. You ought to put together a real timber sale
3:35:55
that could be sold and get fair market value for it, because we'll bid on it."
3:36:00
Whereas, the environmentalists are just trying to stop any activity at all.
3:36:07
You know, there's a group out there that says, "Well, let nature take its course.
3:36:13
Just don't let it burn down my house."
3:36:16
Yes, I know the mentality, but yeah.
3:36:20
And
3:36:24
the conservation community, there is a large constituency who thinks that the
3:36:29
best restoration strategy is hands-off.
3:36:33
I also managed the [PNW] Station's restoration work for a little while.
3:36:36
Right.
3:36:36
And restoration's all a question about either fixing damage or
3:36:41
speeding up natural processes.
3:36:43
Right.
3:36:44
Those are the two questions you ask.
3:36:47
Hands-off is a restoration strategy only if it achieves the outcome you want.
3:36:55
Have you ever read Richard White's Organic Machine?
3:36:58
No.
3:36:58
It's about the Columbia River.
3:37:00
The one thing
3:37:04
he thinks that conservation/environmentalists miss,
3:37:08
or their foundation is skewed, is they almost always view humans working
3:37:16
in nature as an automatic pollutant.
3:37:21
That may be true.
3:37:22
And I agree with them on that standpoint.
3:37:27
Yeah, it's sort of strange because,
3:37:33
when I first started, we were still guided by a lot of utilization
3:37:37
principles, you know, the greatest value for the greatest number.
3:37:42
Kind of a technocratic utilitarianism, right?
3:37:45
Yes.
3:37:45
Right.
3:37:47
I saw those objectives changed.
3:37:49
In some cases, the multiple-use, the first planning efforts, I
3:37:55
thought, were well-intended.
3:37:57
Maybe
3:38:00
we needed to look at a mix of things.
3:38:04
As we did that more and more, it came to show that the greatest values from public
3:38:13
lands were really the non-consumptive.
3:38:15
If you look at a market basket of stuff, the greatest values
3:38:21
are recreation and water.
3:38:23
We're the biggest provider of dispersed recreation opportunities.
3:38:30
Timber and the traditional extractive ones are less valuable.
3:38:34
But people looked at that and said, in some kind of sense of worth;
3:38:39
that means they're not important.
3:38:40
You should have more of this and less of that, but we're
3:38:45
not communicating that right.
3:38:47
Somehow, you have to think more about compatible uses.
3:38:50
Recreationists
3:38:55
are using roads built with timber dollars.
3:38:57
You don't get to that campground over there here in the back of some
3:39:01
national forest without driving on a road built with timber dollars.
3:39:04
A lot of the infrastructure was built on the back of timber receipts.
3:39:08
Right, on timber receipts.
3:39:10
And/or infrastructure created for the timber.
3:39:14
And the maintenance of those roads is still being paid for with timber
3:39:17
receipts because we put up a timber sale, and we put a chunk of money
3:39:20
in there for road maintenance.
3:39:22
Right.
3:39:23
So, how do you better communicate these mutual uses?
3:39:29
And I don't know.
3:39:31
I don't have a simple answer.
3:39:33
I just see that as sort of a pending question that we still struggle with.
3:39:38
That's why we have jobs.
3:39:41
[Laughs] But an interesting kind of just sidebar here as we wrap up is, like I
3:39:46
told you off the record, my wife is a forester and a resource manager from Peru.
3:39:53
And the arguments that we have here over what we can do, what
3:40:00
we can't do, clearcutting, they don't do that down there.
3:40:04
Nature is do much more demanding in the Amazon and the Andes, when you're
3:40:10
talking 15,000-16,000-foot passes dropping 15,000 feet into the Amazon swamp.
3:40:20
I'm just talking about the geography here, the relative elevations and
3:40:28
challenges of creating infrastructure in a more developed economy,
3:40:32
but also geographic limitations.
3:40:35
And it's something that's unique to the United States and North
3:40:39
America, I think, at least in this particular latitudinal swath.
3:40:43
[Temperate zone, resource-rich, etc.]
3:40:44
Yeah, we have an interesting forest sector.
3:40:49
The only other country in the world that has anything quite like us is
3:40:53
Finland, in terms of property rights.
3:40:56
Their forest is mostly privately-owned like ours.
3:41:01
Private landowners sell timber to support their forest industry.
3:41:04
Sweden and Norway have a mix of, still have common property, where villages
3:41:09
own property and private property.
3:41:13
Canada?
3:41:14
Canada is all public land.
3:41:15
That's what I thought.
3:41:17
It's Crown land [legacy term-British Empire/Commonwealth/meaning here
3:41:17
-“public land”] managed by the provinces. There's a little bit of private land
3:41:21
in the east, and depending on how the native land settlements go, there may
3:41:25
be private land-like stuff in the west, but it's “Crown” land, or public land.
3:41:31
There are only four or five countries that are significant softwood countries.
3:41:35
Much of the world works off of hardwoods.
3:41:38
Us, Canada, Japan, Russia, the Nordic countries, and Austria, are the major
3:41:44
softwood-producing countries in the world.
3:41:46
The rest of it is hardwood.
3:41:48
We don't have a lot in Central Europe because there's so many people there, and
3:41:52
the forests are rather limited and small?
3:41:54
They were mostly cleared and they replanted.
3:41:58
What they did replant, they replanted with Norway spruce in the
3:42:03
1800's, and that's a brittle wood.
3:42:06
It suffered badly from acid rain.
3:42:15
They planted a lot of beech and oak because they needed firewood
3:42:18
and they needed furniture wood.
3:42:26
Only two countries, U.S. and Finland, manage their softwood sort
3:42:30
of alike, or have property rights similar, where you can compare them.
3:42:36
They both have market-based systems.
3:42:39
The U.S. differs because
3:42:43
twenty percent of the forest land is still publicly-owned.
3:42:46
Actually, twenty-nine percent, twenty percent federal, and nine percent state.
3:42:50
Which is an outgrowth of the continental expanse coupled to how
3:42:56
the settlement process happened in the 19th century, as well as how territory
3:43:00
and statehood status was assigned.
3:43:02
Right.
3:43:02
It was a unique dynamic to American history.
3:43:05
Right, and then you have public lands in the East which were abused
3:43:09
lands bought back up during the Depression, or abandoned coal mines.
3:43:14
For example, the Jefferson National Forest [Virginia] is old coal mining,
3:43:17
lands owned by a coal-mining company.
3:43:18
There's been a lot more rehabilitation in the East in a lot of respects.
3:43:23
It is especially so in the very southern national forests, like Mississippi.
3:43:28
They bought highly-eroded croplands.
3:43:29
I mean, stuff that you see in these pictures, you know.
3:43:32
Ravines and arroyos?
3:43:33
Right, and they replanted them.
3:43:37
They used the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps] to replant them, and those are
3:43:40
all highly-productive forests now.
3:43:44
Very good.
3:43:44
So, anything else you want to add as a capstone here?
3:43:47
I'll leave that up to you, any story that you have?
3:43:51
Let me just add one thing about personal rewards.
3:43:55
I don't know
3:43:57
whether you're looking for that.
3:43:57
This is your interview, Richard, so you say what you want to say.
3:44:00
Let me, I'll say this about personal rewards.
3:44:04
People often argued and didn't want to get involved in these policy-type
3:44:09
studies, because they felt that it would diminish their personal rewards because
3:44:14
we lived in publish or languish society.
3:44:17
The [PNW] station had a peer review-process that was rigorous
3:44:21
and really stressed the impact of science accomplishments.
3:44:26
And it had a lot of our scientists reluctant to participate in public
3:44:31
policy debates, or science that would be used in public policy debates.
3:44:36
I was evidence that that was not the case.
3:44:41
I went from being a GS-12, the same thing everybody's hired at, new Ph.D.
3:44:47
scientists, and I was a GS-15 in 10 years.
3:44:51
I zipped right through what most people took 30 years to do.
3:44:56
And that was on the back of applied work.
3:44:58
First, I solved
3:45:04
the problem that people had posed about the spatial equilibrium of relating
3:45:09
markets or changes in the West.
3:45:11
You could see how they rippled across the country.
3:45:15
Darius and I solved that in a highly-solvable fashion.
3:45:19
And that enabled me to deal with some of the early stuff, forest policy
3:45:25
stuff, including the early owl runs.
3:45:27
And
3:45:29
I benefited by that.
3:45:32
I had published as much as anybody else published.
3:45:36
My old major professor told me if you get two articles in Forest
3:45:39
Science, your reputation's assured.
3:45:43
And within the first couple of years, I had achieved that.
3:45:47
So, I was evidence that scientists' concern about participating in
3:45:54
these debates was detrimental to your career, was misplaced.
3:46:01
And sure, I had to go up on Capitol Hill and testify, and I
3:46:03
had lawyers lecture me on ethics.
3:46:07
But in the end--
3:46:09
The “Ivory Tower” is safe for some people.
3:46:11
Yeah, it is.
3:46:13
I understand why they like it, but I understand your point completely.
3:46:17
Yeah, but FEMAT offered some people the opportunity to suddenly see
3:46:24
their science in a new context.
3:46:26
As having applied relevance on a high-profile level.
3:46:30
Yes, and they were then able to finish the sentence, “This work is
3:46:33
important because...” This work is important because it allowed us to
3:46:38
establish effective standards and guides for riparian management.
3:46:45
And the evidence here, you know, an individual can write a
3:46:50
reference and say, yes, it did.
3:46:53
So, the Gordie Reeves, the Gordies—Gordon Grant, there are those folks, it
3:46:58
gave them the opportunity to see their science, and it helped them
3:47:02
professionally, to grow professionally.
3:47:04
Right.
3:47:05
There were also people that it didn't help because, though they
3:47:09
participated in the same things, they didn't publish their science.
3:47:13
They went back to doing what they had done before.
3:47:17
The safe corner of whatever they were in doing their work, right?
3:47:21
Yeah, they went back.
3:47:23
That's where they were comfortable, and they didn't want to do the extra work.
3:47:28
You had to live by the sweat of your tongue.
3:47:30
You had to be able to stand on your feet and explain why these
3:47:34
are the standards, what led you to these standards and guides?
3:47:39
Why are they good?
3:47:40
You had to be able to, in an evidence-based way, argue why they are.
3:47:46
And remember, the rules of evidence say, you have a piece of evidence
3:47:49
and you also know its weight.
3:47:52
You might think of a murder trial, you know, if somebody's holding
3:47:56
a smoking gun that's of the same caliber, that's a lot of weight.
3:48:02
But if somebody's standing there and there's a smoking gun on
3:48:04
the floor over there somewhere, that has a different weight.
3:48:09
Same smoking gun, but a different weight.
3:48:12
So, you have to start thinking about your science and the rules of evidence.
3:48:19
Some people got this and some people didn't.
3:48:23
I eventually became a super scientist, or whatever they call
3:48:25
it, largely on the weight of just thinking of the bigger scales.
3:48:32
I did write the framework for the Interior Columbia Basin Project,
3:48:35
arguing that you've got to have goals.
3:48:38
And if you're going to have objectives, they have to be measurable.
3:48:44
Getting scientists to measure their stuff is tough.
3:48:46
But we did.
3:48:47
Folks, people came in and helped them.
3:48:49
And we were able to in the end, look at the three alternatives and
3:48:53
rank them one relative to the other.
3:48:55
And to me, that's a huge accomplishment.
3:48:58
You can place them in a two-dimensional space and you
3:49:00
can say, you know, Alternative A is better than B in this way.
3:49:04
It moves you further up on ecological integrity [scale] , or
3:49:08
it moves you up without impacting social and economic resilience.
3:49:12
That's the political tradeoff.
3:49:16
So, I think that's important, as you talk to these folks, you need to
3:49:19
think about [how] it challenged some scientists and some scientists rose to it.
3:49:25
You know, certainly Jack Thomas.
3:49:27
He described his science as being a mile wide and an inch thick, when you
3:49:32
had a serious discussion with Jack.
3:49:35
But he saw the connections.
3:49:36
He was able to see the connections.
3:49:39
And we called it "dancing beyond your fingertips." You know, when you made
3:49:42
judgments, you didn't want to get too far beyond the fingertips of your knowledge.
3:49:47
And you're waving your arms enough already.
3:49:51
So, how do you do that?
3:49:54
You make judgments based on the evidence you understand and your assessment of
3:49:58
the weight, and you communicate that.
3:50:02
On that note, I think that's a really great finish.
3:50:05
Thank you.
3:50:06
Okay.
3:50:07
Now, traffic-wise…
