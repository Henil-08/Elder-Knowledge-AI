00:02
Hello, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State
00:04
University, College of Forestry.
00:07
I am here with Dr. Bruce Marcot, Research Wildlife Biologist
00:11
for the U.S. Forest Service.
00:14
We are in the
00:17
Tualatin National Wildlife Refuge, and we are going to do an oral history interview
00:21
today that is part of the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project.
00:26
We're going to focus on the Northwest Forest Plan and related issues.
00:29
We're also going to talk a little bit about his biography and related things
00:33
that have to do with training and perception, and how Dr. Marcot came to
00:37
be as a professional and as a biologist, how he came into the Northwest Forest
00:41
Plan process, and how he sees that today.
00:43
So, anyway, good day, Bruce.
00:44
Very good, good day.
00:46
And it is a good day here.
00:47
It's always a good day in places like this, right?
00:50
Quite.
00:51
Like I think you said before we started this, it's nice to
00:53
do this out in beautiful nature rather than a sterile office.
00:57
We're sitting here among beautiful Oregon white oaks, and some Douglas-fir, grand
01:02
fir, and lots of birds around here,
01:06
so a beautiful place.
01:09
I usually like to start with biographical information.
01:17
Tell me where you were born and raised, how you grew up in nature, around nature,
01:22
to appreciate and love nature, and what led you into science and biology.
01:28
Okay.
01:30
Well, I was born in Lynchburg, Virginia.
01:33
I was there for a very short time, a year.
01:36
And our family went a couple places in central New Jersey.
01:42
That's basically where I grew up as a child, a small town called
01:48
Bound Brook, a small town indeed.
01:50
So, we were able to get out on our bikes, go out for the day.
01:54
The back door was always open at the house.
01:57
You know, it's the classic, typical early days of growing up when you didn't
02:01
have to worry about crime and concerns.
02:08
Across the street was a wood lot where I always would hike to and
02:11
catch snakes, even as a little kid.
02:13
I always had an interest and love of outdoors.
02:20
During high school, about halfway through, we moved from Bound Brook up to Wayne, New
02:27
Jersey, up along the New York state line.
02:30
Behind our house was miles and miles of hardwood forest.
02:35
Just beautiful.
02:36
There, I truly got into trying to ferret out, understand
02:41
what the plants are, caught
02:45
snakes and lizards, and brought them into the house, where at times, they would
02:49
get loose and my mom would find them in the closet, being concerned about that.
02:54
From there, most of the way through high school, we came out to Irvine in
03:00
southern California, Orange County, which was quite a culture shift.
03:03
How old were you when you moved out here?
03:05
How old was I?
03:06
I was in third year of high school.
03:08
Okay.
03:09
So, your formative years were definitely in the Northeast.
03:11
That's right.
03:14
But regarding high school, I finished up in Orange County,
03:20
California, and started college.
03:23
Actually, I finished high school a year-and-a-half early, and started
03:26
taking college courses then.
03:30
I was really interested in physics and astronomy, and I started at
03:34
UC-Irvine in physics and astrophysics, and did a couple years there.
03:43
During that time, I started to do summer solo travels on my Honda
03:52
across the continent, basically.
03:54
I would head out for a month or two or three, camping.
03:58
I went all through Canada, one summer rode up to Fairbanks and back.
04:06
Part of that was to visit astrophysical sites and labs, and find out what
04:13
astrophysicists were actually doing.
04:16
I started to realize that I really enjoyed camping out and exploring
04:24
forests and parks along the way.
04:26
So, that really got my interest back into the earth.
04:30
But at the same time, I realized, as an astrophysicist, I would not be able
04:34
to make a substantial contribution to the science until at least a
04:38
post-doc level, truly, in sort of the area that I was interested in.
04:43
So, I got very interested in stellar evolution.
04:48
And I realized that I could make substantial observations, even at a
04:57
sub-graduate level in college in the area of ecology.
05:03
And indeed, that's what got me shifted over.
05:05
So, in 19—oh, when was it?
05:08
1974. I got sick and tired of southern California and all the density there,
05:16
and I packed up everything I had into a trailer, hooked up to my 1964 Dodge
05:20
Dart and went up to Humboldt County, way up in the north coast of California.
05:27
I had no place to live, no certain plan, other than I wanted to go to
05:33
Humboldt State in some area of natural resources, wildlife management.
05:41
So, I found a place to live there, started off, backed out and got my Associate
05:48
of Arts at College of the Redwoods up there, because a lot of the physics and
05:51
math that I had had really didn't help to transfer into an area of biology.
05:58
So, you had to get the prerequisites for the earth sciences?
06:01
That's it.
06:02
That's right.
06:02
So, I got the AA, Associate of Arts in Biology.
06:08
Then went to Humboldt State
06:12
University and did the bachelors, in I think, a couple years, and I did the
06:19
masters in a year in areas of natural resource planning and interpretation, and
06:28
then ecology with an emphasis in forestry.
06:36
At that point, I was working in part on contract work for the Forest Service
06:43
out of Humboldt County, and up in the hills in of the Klamath Mountains
06:50
area there, a beautiful area, very unstudied at that point in time.
06:55
So, that's circa 1974-78,
06:58
virtually no studies going on.
07:01
So, I did studies both for the masters, and then, ultimately for the
07:04
doctorate, under-paid work through the Forest Service, looking at, first
07:10
of all, at limnology of pond habitats on some of the National Forest land.
07:17
Of what value are these ponds to wildlife?
07:20
What sort of, physical, chemical, biological attributes did they have?
07:27
Nothing known there, so that was interesting.
07:29
What were the land management debates in that region at that time?
07:34
Since the National Forest was being heavily cut, clearcutting,
07:38
extensive clearcutting was starting to rear its head as one
07:44
of the issues.
07:46
At that time, I think there was
07:49
regulation on some of the National Forest lands that would limit
07:53
clear-cuts to 80-acre sizes.
07:56
However, when you have an 80-acre clear-cut, and then you wait a couple
08:00
years to plant it, then it's okay to cut the adjacent 80 acres of land.
08:06
So, you end up with vast areas of very young forest.
08:10
We started to realize that the old forests up there were being sort of phased out.
08:16
And this was of course the same time when the last debate over
08:20
the Redwoods was happening.
08:21
Oh, that's right.
08:23
I'm just trying to make a parallel, and this is not the
08:25
Redwood area, but you're close.
08:26
Well, if you want a personal insight into that, I first visited Humboldt County in
08:37
1973 when I rode my motorcycle from southern California prior to heading
08:41
out there in '74, and I found a side road off the Avenue of the Giants in
08:46
Humboldt County, where the last, or not the last, but extensive stands of
08:52
old growth were found there, redwoods.
08:56
And I found this one little
08:59
side road grove at dusk that I threw the sleeping bag down on the ground.
09:05
I found
09:09
birds in the area.
09:10
It was beautiful.
09:11
Old iconic
09:15
trees all around, a beautiful spot.
09:18
When I moved out there in '74, I went and found that exact same
09:21
spot and it had been clear-cut.
09:24
It broke my heart to have seen what happened.
09:26
It was just a vast area of downed wood, slash, the soil was turned over.
09:32
In fact, the stream itself was gone where I had been.
09:36
So, that was kind of a shock.
09:38
And that sort of opened my eyes to what could be the influence
09:42
that type of cutting had on
09:45
land on wildlife.
09:48
That must have been pretty traumatic to be there after it had been
09:52
such an important place early-on.
09:54
That's right.
09:54
And then, my goodness, did you know it was going to be that
09:57
way, or did you hear about it, or
09:58
- ? No, no.
09:58
I went thinking that it was still there, that it was still this
10:02
beautiful old-growth forest.
10:05
And bam!
10:06
It was gone.
10:07
Yes.
10:08
So, that's a sense of the issue I was facing on Forest Service land
10:13
from studies I was doing from '76 through, oh, '79, even into about '84
10:19
for both the masters and the doctoral work, dealing with early-successional
10:24
stages following clear-cutting.
10:28
I wanted to study what actually is up there, what you gain, what
10:32
you lose, and what the landscape features are when somewhat
10:39
sensitive areas are cut in that way.
10:45
So,
10:48
having grown up in New Jersey and then coming to California,
10:51
having this East-West thing,
10:56
you told me about the crowding and pollution in Los Angeles.
11:00
What about what you saw growing up in New Jersey impacted how you
11:04
viewed the man-nature relationship and the responsibility of the
11:07
land manager, and how we develop policies and implement them?
11:12
Kind of the context of East to West, the learning curve, and
11:16
kind of how you matured into your professional and intellectual selves?
11:21
First of all, I was really glad I did have that kind of a culture shock
11:28
switch from East to West, because ultimately, it really helped to
11:34
educate me as to the cultural implications of how people, not
11:42
scientists or decision-makers, but everyday townspeople, view the land.
11:49
The small towns that I was in, in Bound Brook, and then up in
11:52
Wayne, back in Jersey, were in a suburb area, but it was spread out.
11:59
Each house had a lot of land, and people just naturally assumed that
12:04
that's how they should live, that there should be extensive green areas between
12:11
houses, behind houses, and so on.
12:14
A quick side point.
12:15
I recently got on Google Earth and looked at the spots where I
12:19
had grown up in, those houses.
12:22
Bound Brook was pretty much the same, but Wayne was now impacted
12:26
with this massive suburb incursion.
12:31
So, the forest that I had explored as a kid now was all dense housing.
12:40
This is kind of the outgrowth of the greater New York/New Jersey area.
12:44
Correct?
12:44
It's got to be, that's right, yes.
12:47
Just like the area, the city here [refuge in Tualatin] , is becoming more and
12:51
more part of the urban area of Portland.
12:55
How would you compare that to Los Angeles?
12:57
You weren't there long and I suppose your foundational experiences maybe were more
13:02
important to you, but Los Angeles still is a takeoff point for what you would study
13:08
later on, just because of the insanity of the Los Angeles basin, for instance.
13:12
Well, I was actually south of L.A., in Orange County.
13:14
In Irvine, yes.
13:16
But the whole area I saw was rapidly becoming increasingly occupied.
13:22
Every inch.
13:24
On one of the bike trips that I had taken, I was gone for three
13:27
months, camping across the continent.
13:30
Got back, and one evening, I tried to find a little spot, just to sit on
13:36
the side of a hill, and I could not, because every side road was fenced off.
13:42
I had to break through a fence, barbwire fence, to go sit in some farm field.
13:47
It was right after dusk.
13:49
And I'll never forget, as I was sitting there wondering if I should
13:52
stay in that area at all, a large buck deer came right up to me, then
13:59
sauntered off, out of the dark.
14:01
It was quite an encounter.
14:05
And I felt like we were both lost there.
14:09
Nature still being resilient in its own way?
14:12
Well, hopefully.
14:13
But at
14:15
that point I felt like I should find a venue and place to live,
14:22
and to leave the area of physics and go into ecology, which at that
14:30
time was a very, very soft science.
14:33
Now,
14:36
when you were still involved and interested in astrophysics
14:38
because of where you were, I would anticipate that you went up to Mount
14:43
Palomar on more than one occasion.
14:45
Oh, yes, sure.
14:46
And that 200-inch giant telescope, I remember.
14:50
The Hale Telescope.
14:51
That's right, yes.
14:52
I remember reading about that as a kid, about a mirror 200 inches across.
14:56
That's right.
14:56
So, you're talking about how you became interested in the
15:00
places around these sites.
15:02
That's right.
15:03
Was that also true for the Palomar Observatory and the mountains over there?
15:06
Oh, the chaparral, yes, definitely.
15:07
Yes.
15:08
Chaparral is such an interesting system.
15:11
It's fire-adapted, which a lot of people are building in it, but they really
15:18
didn't seem to grasp that when fires would happen, they would break out and be
15:22
very intense, and tons of fire would go up slopes and hit houses up on the top.
15:28
They expect their homes
15:33
would be fire-free.
15:34
So, it struck me that some people were not understanding what kind of an ecosystem
15:40
they were in – what had come earlier, and then, what the dynamics of the system are.
15:46
I saw that also in some of the floodplains back in some of the Midwest
15:51
area, where folks would constantly build and rebuild in areas that would
15:55
flood annually or every so often.
16:00
Why would folks want to build and live in areas that are prone
16:04
to and adapted to these sorts of intensive catastrophic events?
16:13
Human hubris and arrogance?
16:15
No.
16:15
I think it's just lack of understanding, lack of knowledge, really.
16:21
So, in that sense, I wanted to do something where I could provide some
16:27
insights, scientific understanding, like from the standpoint of studying
16:32
cut- blocks and clear-cuts and what comes afterwards, instead
16:35
of just assuming it has no
16:41
influence, either good or bad.
16:43
Now, who would have been your scientific heroes in your early years, but also
16:47
in your early professional years?
16:49
If you want to say a couple astronomers, and maybe a couple biologists, people
16:54
that you would have looked to or you would have always read what they wrote?
16:57
How about the 19th century philosopher, Henri Bergson,
17:03
because he was one of the very few, very first, who wrote about evolution
17:07
from a philosophical standpoint.
17:10
And that really hit home, too.
17:11
Was that post-Darwin?
17:13
No, that was pre.
17:13
[Post-dated Darwin by a little – Marcot corrected]
17:13
. That's what I thought.
17:16
I don't know if Darwin had tapped into that or not.
17:21
But, I was definitely into understanding the roots of philosophy.
17:29
Philosophy of science, and especially of nature, and how
17:32
folks evolved their thinking, to better understand where we are now.
17:37
Otherwise, we're doomed to repeat it and all that.
17:39
And there's a couple things I picked up off your website and some of
17:42
the things, and we'll talk about that near the end of the interview.
17:45
Okay.
17:45
But along the lines of philosophy of nature and
17:47
perception, and things like that.
17:49
Okay,
17:52
okay.
17:52
Darwin, I don't know about, philosophically.
17:56
His father was a minister.
17:59
A poet, also.
18:00
Yes, but he read--
18:01
Erasmus Darwin, yes.
18:03
But right before he left [on the “Voyage of the Beagle”] , he read a lot of Charles
18:06
Lyell's uniformitarian geology stuff.
18:08
Yes.
18:09
Basically, the historicization of geology led directly to him seeing biology in
18:15
a very long duration, historical way.
18:18
Lyle was a uniformitarianist, right?
18:21
Right, right.
18:22
Which basically says that things had been always as they are now, right?
18:27
Or the processes.
18:27
[Consistent geologic processes/effects over time.]
18:28
Right, right.
18:30
The processes are similar enough to where you can judge, based on looking at
18:34
[current processes] , that you could take it back in time and interpret the past.
18:39
Just like an anthropologist would say, here's how these people lived,
18:42
and then look backwards in time.
18:44
Although, you can be accused of what they call the "presentist viewpoint
18:47
." Good, right.
18:48
But still, yeah.
18:49
Yes, and the flaw there is that it did not take into account things such as tectonic
18:55
plate shifts and continental drift.
18:57
One of my favorite books, and this is really quite a side point here, but one
19:01
of my favorite books is by a fellow named Darlington, published I think in 1957,
19:05
on zoo-geography of the world, in which he looked at where groups of animals are.
19:13
You find similar animals, say, in the southern part of South America as you
19:17
do in the southern part of Africa.
19:19
Why?
19:21
His explanations for that, and borrowing from others, too, was
19:25
entirely self-consistent and was pre-tectonic plate theory.
19:30
Which is actually fairly recent in terms of being accepted as a paradigm,
19:36
the truth paradigm, and by that, I mean like 60-70 years [Early 1960s]
19:38
. That's right.
19:39
But the lesson there is that science at that time was self-consistent,
19:43
was able to explain what
19:47
seemed to be anomalous observations.
19:50
You have the same species or same taxa found in completely different,
19:55
distinct parts of the Earth.
19:57
Why?
19:58
Well, not understanding about plate drift and that sort of
20:02
the thing, the explanations were cogent, they were consistent.
20:09
It made me think that, well, science does this.
20:12
Then, you know, Thomas Kuhn, with the structure of scientific revolutions, says
20:18
that every so often there's a paradigm shift, and that's kind of overstated.
20:21
But in that case, that's what happened, too.
20:25
It taught me to be real careful about assuming an explanation is always correct,
20:33
if it's consistent with observations.
20:38
Because you can come up with a consistent cogent explanation that is consistent
20:42
with observations that's wrong.
20:45
Observations can be very simplistic.
20:49
They can be not eclectic enough, not pluralistic enough, not historical
20:55
enough, not geographic enough.
20:57
I mean, we all have our own lens of where we came up, or where we live
21:02
or where we formed as a person, and that's always going to be the filter.
21:07
I think it depends on how we get outside of that and look
21:09
at all the other evidence.
21:11
That's good.
21:12
And that's sort of why I was really influenced by studying
21:15
philosophy of science.
21:16
The early days of Carnap and others back in the early part of
21:21
the 19th century, who were called the logical positivists, posited
21:28
that there are such things as absolute facts, absolute data information
21:34
that we can basically understand everything if we have adequate
21:40
observations.
21:41
And it was almost kind of an ultra-sort of mechanistic viewpoint.
21:49
Whereas, in the '60s, there was a real shift in philosophy of science,
21:52
what's called the, I think it was the “new wave” of philosophy of
21:57
science, where folks were talking more about context of observations.
22:02
Not so much that things are arbitrary in our understanding,
22:05
but they're relative to context.
22:07
That always made a lot of sense to me.
22:10
So, just like the Darlington book, pre-tectonic plate drift theory,
22:15
explaining species distributions in a very, very cogent way, sort
22:23
of how the “new wave” would say it's okay if there are shifts in
22:26
understanding and shifts in explanation.
22:30
So, that really hit home as I got more and more into ecology.
22:34
The same thing happened in my discipline where the objectivist paradigm of
22:38
history, where you can always find facts and its objective, and you can create
22:44
a “real” picture of history, whatever you're writing about, wherever you are.
22:49
And the post-modern era, or the '60s and after, or however you want to call
22:53
it, exploded a lot of those notions, to where it said, no, you don't know
22:57
everything, and everybody's got a filter, and it's not the only filter.
23:01
So, it made my field, as I was growing up professionally in school, incredibly
23:07
pluralistic, almost to the point of being relativistic where you didn't
23:11
know where you stood sometimes.
23:12
But nonetheless, I think the old paradigms you were talking about
23:15
in your sciences and in my field, they had to be challenged, and
23:19
maybe exploded and reassembled.
23:21
Yep.
23:22
If that makes any sense.
23:23
It does, it does.
23:23
Almost like realizing that Newtonian physics does not explain everything.
23:29
Hey, Newton got a lot of things right, but there's a lot of things he just
23:32
didn't know because it was the 1700's.
23:34
Sure, that's right.
23:36
[Laughs] This is true.
23:37
So, you're at Humboldt State and you had the experience you told me
23:42
about regarding the Redwood groves.
23:45
What particular mentor, classes, experience, disciplines, could you
23:51
say, that shaped you from that point on, that you would then take and
23:55
that would be the most, not, I won't use the term determining factor, but
23:59
the most influential on your career?
24:01
Humboldt State.
24:02
That's only a four-year college, so I got the Masters of Science there.
24:07
When I finished that, I was offered a job for a year-and-a-half to fill in a
24:15
sabbatical leave.
24:16
So, I taught full-time there in wildlife ecology.
24:22
I was given a completely free hand to teach anything I wanted, so I taught
24:28
“Introduction to Wildlife Ecology,” “Population Science” and “Ecology.” I
24:32
taught a course or two over in math on
24:42
application of modeling and quite a few things.
24:45
The person I filled in for, who was my de facto advisor, a very-good
24:52
friend, a professor named James, or Jim Koplin, K-O-P-L-I-N.
24:58
He was not very well-liked, because he was really gruff and had this very
25:02
rough, sand-papery sort of attitude.
25:06
And once you got past that and sort of challenged him, he was kind
25:10
and he would take time, and just a wonderful, wonderful experience to
25:19
interact with and to learn from.
25:21
He was always there for me.
25:22
Yes, so,
25:25
that meant a lot.
25:26
He passed away some time back, so I was very, very sad to hear of that.
25:33
Also, a fellow named Ken Lang, L-A-N-G, who was in the biology department, ended
25:41
up being my senior prof on my thesis
25:48
work, even though I got the thesis in the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
25:55
Somehow, Humboldt State was open enough where I could
26:01
actually craft my own degree.
26:04
I was able to draw on ecology from Ken,
26:09
and yet draw some of the wildlife management part from Koplin, even though
26:15
he wasn't really formally on my group
26:21
committee.
26:22
So,
26:25
there were certain courses like ecology, I took from Ken Lang.
26:31
That was outstanding and insightful.
26:34
I took a limnology course that was very interesting.
26:38
It got me so interested that I was asked to teach the lab, even though I
26:41
was taking the course at the same time because of the study I was doing on ponds.
26:49
But there were several courses in philosophy I took there.
26:52
I've always tried to advise students, don't just take courses in your
26:56
field of study, be broad, look at language and art, philosophy, history.
27:04
Because that will really help you understand better whatever
27:07
field you actually focus
27:13
on.
27:13
Since then, I've done so much work in other parts of the world.
27:17
I'm really glad I had a spattering of first, all sorts
27:22
of languages, history and so on.
27:27
It sounds like Humboldt State was the perfect place for you, rather than
27:29
if you'd gone to one of the big-name universities, and you would have been
27:33
locked into a particular canon and tract, you would have had probably
27:38
some really strong-willed, famous scientist on your committee, and you
27:44
would have been more trapped, instead of free to form your own paths?
27:48
Absolutely right.
27:49
Yes, I was given a free hand to craft a thesis, craft a project.
27:53
Work any way that I had an interest, as long as it conformed to sound science.
27:59
But you're absolutely right.
28:01
Back in UC-Irvine I recall sitting in physics classes of 300-400 students
28:10
plus, sitting in the back, you could hardly see the prof in front.
28:14
There was no way you could ask anything.
28:15
There's nowhere to go in after hours.
28:18
Yes, Humboldt was much, much better, much more interactive.
28:22
Yes, I went to Arizona State.
28:24
Oh, yeah?
28:24
I spent time there.
28:24
And it was huge when I was there as an undergraduate.
28:27
I mean, an economics lecture hall with 350 students.
28:27
There
28:32
you go.
28:34
I think I only had one other one that was just like that, but
28:36
ASU had 50,000 students, so they had to pack them in somewhere.
28:40
Yes, right.
28:41
Where did you do your Ph.D.?
28:44
At Oregon State.
28:45
At Oregon State.
28:46
University in Corvallis.
28:46
Right, and tell me how you came to come up to Corvallis.
28:51
That's good.
28:53
I haven't thought about that for years.
28:56
I was doing a contract, temporary
29:02
[employment status] in the Forest Service.
29:04
I had finished up thesis work on the M.S. at Humboldt State, and was doing
29:12
a project for the Forest Service on clear-cuts, looking at birds in the
29:18
early seral stages of vegetation succession in the Klamath Mountains,
29:20
a study that hadn't ever been done.
29:25
I was on a temporary stint with the Forest Service, and
29:31
it was Jack Ward Thomas and Jack Capp, who
29:37
worked at the Region 5 office,
29:43
in San Francisco, California, who had interests in sponsoring
29:47
me to go for the doctorate.
29:50
They knew I had a real strong interest in the Forest Service,
29:52
and doing science helpful to planners and folks in management.
29:59
And this was the time when the "-ologists" [scientists] were becoming
30:02
more and more integrated into the Forest Service, in the '70s and '80s.
30:06
The agency wanted to do that, but then saw it as a necessity, because
30:10
of all the new environmental laws, and they needed evidence to do whatever.
30:14
That's right.
30:16
They set me up with a contract, which I wrote the science part of a clear-cut
30:22
study, post clear-cut, to study mid-stage vegetation growth in the
30:28
Klamath Mountains, looking at birds.
30:33
They directed me to speak to a fellow named Charles Meslow, who
30:38
was Professor at Oregon State in the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
30:47
I hopped on my bike, my Honda, from Humboldt, rode up to Corvallis
30:52
and saw Chuck Meslow there.
30:55
He, rather begrudgingly, accepted me as a student, and the Forest Service
31:02
was going to essentially pay for my
31:06
stint there.
31:09
I showed up in his office, had my helmet in hand and my
31:18
bike jacket on, my boots, and long hair, and the first thing he asked me was, "Do
31:23
you hunt or fish?" Because at that point, I realized that's the department I was in.
31:28
It was going to take some interest on my part to bring more of the hardcore math
31:36
and physics and science and modeling that I had learned early on into this field,
31:42
at least at that point and in that place.
31:44
Eventually, Chuck Meslow and I got along just great.
31:47
He was so helpful with everything, always there for me.
31:51
At first, you were wondering if you were going to receive a good
31:54
reception, because you were the “biker hippie” from California, right?
31:59
Exactly, right.
32:01
That's right.
32:02
By the way, just for the record, what CC Honda did you have that
32:06
went all over the continent?
32:07
It was the 450.
32:08
It was a 450.
32:09
Scrambler, high-pipes.
32:10
A
32:12
couple times, I had semi-knobby tires, because I would take
32:17
off on extensive dirt roads.
32:19
You know, I rode the Alcan up to Alaska, of course, through
32:25
the Yukon.
32:26
And that was when it was all dirt, dirt and gravel, too.
32:30
Yes, so, a 450.
32:31
Had to know for the record, the bike we're talking about all the time.
32:35
No fairing , no shield, anything.
32:38
Those were reliable [Early Hondas were known for their reliability]
32:39
. Oh, man.
32:41
Till the end?
32:43
No, no.
32:43
I put 80,000 or 90,000 [miles] on that bike, which at that
32:48
time, was a lot of miles.
32:50
It was a dual-vertical twin, double-overhead cam.
32:55
I did all my own tune-ups, work on it and everything.
32:58
Tuned the dual
33:02
carbs by ear, like that.
33:04
So, you're in Corvallis now.
33:06
And you're studying under Meslow and some other people.
33:11
Right.
33:11
Tell me about that experience and how that augmented, changed, altered,
33:15
or just added, to what you'd already done, or did you change them?
33:19
Both.
33:20
I think.
33:27
Oregon State was tough for me because it was like going to a rigorous,
33:30
confined-sideboards [situation]
33:37
. I did not have the latitude that I had at Humboldt State.
33:40
For instance, I recommended trading out some of the mandatory courses people
33:46
said I had already done or known for other things, like art history, and
33:51
they said, no, I can't do that at all.
33:54
So, I ended up at the doctoral level, just being a student at the back, or
33:58
not back, or inside a class, having to parrot back what the prof said.
34:03
It was very, very scant interaction with other students, and almost
34:08
none with any of the profs.
34:11
So, I just wanted to finish up and get out as soon as I could there.
34:14
I just kept my head down
34:18
and I was able to make some shifts and changes inside the department I was in.
34:23
I was instrumental in talking Chuck Meslow into, and bless his heart, buying
34:30
the very first PC ever for that school.
34:36
It was an IBM PC.
34:37
I think it was like 1982, that it had just come out.
34:43
This was the XT version that had a 10—oh, boy, it had a 5-1/4" floppy disk and a
34:55
10 Meg hard drive on it. And Chuck said, "What are you going to use that for?
35:00
We have the main frame." Well, I ended up doing the thesis work on it.
35:04
I did all the stats on it.
35:05
You got involved in computer work fairly early on, didn't you?
35:08
Well, back East, my folks, God bless them, would always give me science kits.
35:13
I built a computer, a plastic working digital computer, I think
35:21
I was 12 or 13 at that time, from a kit by Edmund Scientific Company.
35:29
And it actually worked.
35:32
There were sliding plastic bars, you could put in pins to program it a certain way.
35:40
It had a digital, zero-one output.
35:42
So, that's the way I learned, very, very early on.
35:48
So, during this time, you got your doctorate in '84?
35:51
Am I correct?
35:52
Yes, that's right.
35:53
And
35:56
everything is changing in the late '70s, early '80s, regarding
36:01
forestry and the Northwest.
36:04
All the things are either happening or building toward the Forest Wars, the
36:10
debate over how we're going to manage our land, clearcutting, everything that
36:13
would define the next 10-15 years and even to the present day, but especially up
36:17
till the [Northwest] Forest Plan itself.
36:19
What do you remember about that process as you were coming of age intellectually
36:23
and professionally, coming up from Humboldt, you had your traumatic
36:29
experience of the Redwood grove, you come up, you see what's happening in Oregon,
36:33
you see the lawsuits are starting, the owl is starting to be discussed as an
36:38
endangered species, but not listed yet.
36:41
Tell me how you came into that process -- and you're back
36:44
in the Forest Service again?
36:46
When I worked for Six Rivers National Forest in California during the mid-'70s,
36:53
I built for them the first wildlife habitat information base system that
37:01
set up a database on all vertebrate species, including data for each
37:07
species and their micro-habitats,
37:10
niche attributes, and
37:16
key ecological functions.
37:19
And I did that on a Tektronix
37:24
4050 micro-computer.
37:25
Remember, this is early, this is like circa '76 or so, '77.
37:29
I remember when Tektronix opened their plant up here by Portland.
37:32
That's right.
37:33
It was like, wow, all the smart tech people are in Tektronix.
37:38
Silicon Valley of Oregon, yeah.
37:40
Right, right.
37:41
Before the modern digital age.
37:42
Yes.
37:44
The mechanical computer age, would that be a better way of saying it?
37:47
Well, no, it was still digital.
37:49
Well, anyway.
37:52
It had 8-inch or 10-inch floppy disks, and streaming tape for backup; that was new.
38:04
I programmed it in a series of languages, like Basic A. I wrote a
38:11
compiler for it and a data entry system.
38:15
Then, I wrote a program where you could do freeform Boolean query.
38:18
This is for the Forest Service, that would allow managers to ask things like,
38:25
if I was to change a habitat, change a forest type, or change an age class of
38:32
forest, harvest it and take out snags, or leave snags, to bring in deadwood,
38:36
or not; what species could be adversely or positively influenced by it, by
38:42
querying this information base system.
38:45
That was one of the first times that had been done.
38:47
I finished up the doctorate, and then, my wife and I, late '84, came up
39:01
to Portland and I started at the regional office [Region] of the Forest Service.
39:05
And so, I brought that experience of trying to look at wildlife systems as
39:13
a whole, of not just all the species, but also all the habitat attributes
39:18
that they need, and all their ecological processes and functions, which species
39:23
tend to pollinate, which species tend to disperse seeds, and on and on.
39:31
I brought that into the realm of old-growth management, as we started to
39:37
worry about the loss of old growth from folks like Jerry Franklin and others.
39:45
So, I built one of the first information bases looking at old-growth species.
39:49
And that was pre-Forest Plan in a project called the Scientific Analysis Team,
39:59
or SAT, that was led by Jack Thomas.
40:02
That was even before the ISC Report [Interagency
40:05
Scientific Committee] came out.
40:05
Right?
40:05
And that would be late '80s?
40:07
Correct.
40:08
Yes.
40:09
How would you describe Forest Service culture in the '70s and the '80s, with
40:14
the traditional management class vis-à-vis the "-ologists," the science, the people
40:20
that are coming in, their ideas are swirling around, and the new ideas, and
40:26
this is what the agency needs to consider?
40:27
What do you remember about the culture and how receptive or not receptive it
40:31
was, and how that started to change?
40:34
Well, I'll just speak for myself.
40:36
I tried hard to work with silviculturists and foresters, and I have worked at
40:40
the Pacific Northwest Research Station [PNW] of the Forest Service, out at
40:44
the [ranger] district offices, at national forest supervisors' offices,
40:47
a couple regional offices, and
40:52
the Washington D.C. office.
40:53
And really, always tried to get along with silvivculturists,
41:03
foresters, planners, when out in the field.
41:05
I felt that they had the greatest power, in a sense, to really
41:10
influence what's going to happen out
41:15
there.
41:15
Especially in that era.
41:16
Yes, that's right.
41:18
I mean, you hadn't had the paradigm shift occur, the one that became more inculcated
41:22
as it did another generation later.
41:23
That's right.
41:25
But still, in spite of the fact that I tried to work closely, and there were some
41:28
who were wonderful at the regional office in Portland to interact with, and out on
41:33
the national forests and within individual
41:37
offices of the forests.
41:39
There were others, and I don't want to bring up any certain names, who
41:46
viewed me as an outsider, someone who was trying to cause harm to
41:51
their interests and thinking.
41:56
I felt compelled
42:01
to tread carefully in certain offices with certain people.
42:06
On the spotted owl, there was one person who was put in charge of the spotted
42:13
owl project at the regional office, and again, I don't want to bring up names,
42:19
but he was apparently ousted from his national forest for having illegally
42:27
obtained firewood off of his own forest.
42:29
Whether that's true or not, I don't know.
42:32
But he clearly had an “attitude,” as did the regional forester
42:37
at that time, that the
42:40
"-ologist" coming in was someone to
42:47
have to train, to direct.
42:50
Almost like breaking a bronco, right?
42:53
Well.
42:55
[Laughs] Maybe an ass, but that's rhetorical.
42:58
Okay, you brought it up.
43:01
That's okay.
43:03
Oh, there were times when I probably was.
43:06
I didn't want to go there, but I'm trying to make a point about, well,
43:10
you brought up Thomas Kuhn earlier, that you can even extend the theory
43:14
of scientific revolutions in different areas, as he talks about “normal
43:17
science,” scientific revolution is the buildup to the paradigm shifts.
43:22
You can even take that analogy to human psychology in the institutional
43:26
behavior in terms of how the energy builds up, something then cracks,
43:31
and then, something goes forward.
43:32
And I think that's a good model you could use to describe a lot
43:35
of things, institutional, and cultural, and technological.
43:37
Very interesting.
43:37
What causes the crack then?
43:39
Is it science, is it sociology, what causes the crack?
43:46
Social psychology?
43:48
I think it's everything.
43:49
It's like we were talking about studying ecosystem science, a
43:53
holistic, eclectic, scientific discipline of disciplines, really.
43:58
And we can also look at what we're talking about from any one of those
44:01
angles, psycho-analytic theory, sociology, history, political science
44:09
theories, etc., and they all have a part.
44:11
They all have different languages, in explaining really the same process, just
44:16
from a different angle with different descriptive mechanisms of the subjects.
44:20
If that makes any sense?
44:21
Yes, it does.
44:24
That's good.
44:25
I've heard from a lot of interviewees in this project,
44:30
and others regarding the new ideas and new people, and I don't want to
44:36
use the word threaten, because some people viewed it that way, as it was
44:42
challenging the established order.
44:46
With the Forest Service, especially in the post-World War II era when industrial
44:50
forestry got rolling here in the Northwest, it was an established order.
44:56
There were the timber people, there were the managers, and a good-old boy network.
45:02
It really was good-old boys, because there wasn't too many women,
45:04
if any, in some of those areas.
45:06
Exactly right, yes.
45:06
And so, it was a culture of society.
45:12
I'd like to say, though,
45:16
shall we?
45:17
[Airplane noise]
45:17
We're going to take it off just for a sec here.
45:20
[Break

45:23
The point I wanted to finish with was, at the regional office in Portland,
45:27
back in 1985 through the late '80s, in the Fish and Wildlife section,
45:36
the director of the Fish and Wildlife section there was Hugh C. Black, who was
45:44
prescient.
45:45
He was absolutely wonderful.
45:46
He was part of the old school, part of the old, good-old boys.
45:49
But he clearly saw that quantitative science looking at information
45:56
bases, bringing science into management, was essential.
45:59
He gave me so much help and support, ensuring that I'd be hired on.
46:07
If it wasn't for him, the earlier folks, Jack Thomas and Jack Kapp,
46:10
I would have probably not gotten nearly as far in my field as I
46:16
had at that time and afterwards.
46:18
So, Hugh Black was a
46:23
very, very thoughtful and forward-thinking "old guard."
46:31
I'm going to ask you a two-part question, and I'm thinking on my feet
46:34
here as we're going through this.
46:35
Okay.
46:36
Now, Oregon State University, and especially at that time, if you'd
46:40
gone mostly into forestry, it was kind of old-school forestry at that time.
46:46
It was becoming challenged, but it was still kind of old-school forestry?
46:50
Correct?
46:51
I did a minor in
46:54
silviculture and forestry.
46:56
So, I took courses over there and they had no interest in someone coming
47:00
in from cross-discipline interests.
47:05
They were there to learn forestry and forest operations, period.
47:08
Okay.
47:09
No, that's okay.
47:10
I was just saying, you already had a perception and practice because you went
47:17
to school down in California, but also you needed to work out in the field in
47:21
a more eclectic, interdisciplinary way.
47:23
So, you had a different perspective on land management than maybe regardless
47:30
of what they would have tried to have taught you at Oregon State.
47:32
Am I correct?
47:33
Yes,
47:36
right.
47:36
But you're still going to have your other views.
47:40
How did you reconcile those two?
47:44
Patience.
47:45
Honestly.
47:45
There were quite a few times in the
47:52
'80s at the regional office of the Forest Service, where we would present
47:57
things to the regional forester or to other departments and groups, where
48:04
introducing the idea of having a cross-discipline approach to managing
48:08
landscapes, to managing old forests, as important, not just socially and
48:13
culturally, but ecologically, was met with disdain and old-school attitudes.
48:20
There were wonderful people like Hugh Black, who, thank
48:25
God, they were there to help.
48:28
But I recall sitting in quite a few times on some of the early sessions
48:34
of the regional forester in his office, and others there, and I'd be
48:38
called upon to help explain what I was doing looking at the suite of species
48:41
associated not just with spotted owls, but the other attributes of ecological
48:47
functions of old forest systems.
48:50
It would be met with silence.
48:51
Then, the director, the one who was less than ethical, like I brought up
48:57
earlier, would turn to the regional forester and say, "We'll fix this."
49:03
Intending to mean that there's nothing that I was going to do that was going to
49:06
get in the path of their interests, of
49:14
timber harvest first, basically.
49:15
How do you remember the conversations going on as the momentum and the
49:20
energy built up during the '80s?
49:21
You were there, really the last half of the '80s, leading up to
49:26
the lawsuit by the Seattle Audubon Society, the Dwyer injunction.
49:30
[Over northern spotted owl/Endangered Species Act.]
49:31
Sure.
49:31
What
49:34
do you remember about the “old guard” reacting and even adapting,
49:39
and how people like Black and other people started saying, well,
49:42
we need to start going this way?
49:44
How do you remember that dynamic?
49:48
Just extreme tension.
49:53
Back in physics, I would have called it a high mu value, which is the
49:58
coefficient of friction, basically.
50:01
That's what it was among many of these people.
50:05
I gave a talk at an old-growth conference.
50:09
It was held
50:14
at the Arlene Schnitzer [Performing Arts Center, in Portland]
50:15
. Concert Hall.
50:15
Concert Hall, that's right, downtown Portland.
50:16
I was on the last of the day, and I talked about how different people view
50:20
old-growth differently, so you can end up with inventories that seem to be
50:23
different, and that could be explained according to attributes they used.
50:28
But toward the end, I sort of injected my view and said, regardless of what
50:34
you use, you're still dealing with these astounding, iconic, unique systems, which,
50:40
if your interest is to preserve the full suite of all ecological attributes out on
50:47
forest lands, there's nothing like them.
50:50
I found out much, much later from a colleague who was sitting in the audience
50:54
that a forester or two sitting next to him, started to “harrumph” and growl,
50:58
about how dare this scientist come up there and tell us something about
51:04
sociology or cultural values of forests.
51:09
He's stepping outside of his scope.
51:11
Yet, there was Jerry Franklin doing that as a matter of course, among others.
51:17
So yes, there was that tension, friction, that was very, very obvious, personally,
51:23
and then inside the culture of the agencies, plural, so including BLM,
51:32
principally, inside the Northwest
51:37
area.
51:38
So, I take it that Jerry Franklin and what became called "New Forestry"
51:43
during the '80s and the early '90s, was not met with open arms initially,
51:49
except for a few open-minded people?
51:51
Uh--
51:52
Or was that too generalized?
51:55
No.
51:55
I think Jerry was trying to introduce new ideas.
51:58
We have to mention Hal Salwasser.
52:01
Hal Salwasser from Oregon State ? [U.S. Forest Service before OSU.]
52:02
Yes.
52:04
I knew him way back in Humboldt County era.
52:10
He had a strong interest in helping me early in my career, which I think he
52:15
saw would help him, too, at the Forest Service regional office in California.
52:22
He introduced the idea of “New Forestry,” or, I'm sorry, "New
52:28
Perspectives." That was his idea.
52:31
That was the program inside the Forest Service, both at the regional and finally
52:37
at the Washington office levels, he was trying to introduce that would integrate
52:41
a lot of Franklin's New Forestry ideas.
52:47
In the archives I am curating now, from the late '80s and early '90s, there's a
52:52
lot of documents on the New Perspectives program in the Forest Service.
52:56
Good.
52:56
I give Hal Salwasser just great applause and kudos for having done that.
53:07
So, he was on sort of the contrary side to the frictionists, if you will.
53:13
Frictionists?
53:13
[Laughter] Is that a political party?
53:19
No comment.
53:20
Now,
53:26
tell me a bit more about how you developed as a biologist in terms of
53:31
the species of the most interest to you?
53:34
Obviously, you studied a suite of species, but you became known for certain things.
53:40
How did you become attached to certain species, more
53:42
interested in birds or whatever?
53:44
I have always tried to stay general and broad.
53:49
I studied birds for the Ph.D. dissertation.
53:54
But it was all birds out there that I could find.
53:58
And then, elsewhere, I studied soil invertebrates and algae and mammals, and
54:06
just, you know, all plants, all the taxa, so that I could just learn about systems.
54:13
So, I see myself more of a systems ecologist than a species specialist.
54:17
And a wildlife biologist, because people generally get
54:20
tracked into a certain group.
54:22
Which we need, and that's good.
54:23
Absolutely.
54:28
I did an early survey and study of the northern spotted
54:31
owl in the Klamath Mountains.
54:35
That was under a contract for the Forest Service.
54:39
I was doing that at the same time I was doing the early stage of my
54:42
dissertation and teaching at Humboldt State; actually, all at the same time.
54:48
That was '76,
54:51
published, I think, in '77.
54:53
I also studied the flammulated owl at the same time, again
54:57
up in the Klamath Mountains.
54:58
This really got me into owls, as part of my
55:07
"severe [intellectual] disease" of wanting to study everything as
55:12
an ecologist, so many things that I have not wanted to focus
55:17
on one thing as a specialist.
55:21
What is the strength and what is the weakness of focusing on one species, for
55:27
instance, the spotted owl, the murrelet, as indicator species -- politically,
55:33
ecologically, or management-wise?
55:36
Well, strength-wise, it’s important when you can collaborate with others
55:44
who have a different
55:52
context.
55:52
I was a biological advisor for the first round of the Northern Spotted
55:57
Owl Recovery Team [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] work, and parts of
56:02
that team were spotted owl experts.
56:05
Marty Raphael spent time doing
56:08
studies of marine species , resource selection, that sort
56:13
of thing for that species.
56:15
I think the strength is to have both of us on the same team.
56:20
I've always sought out working on teams with others who have
56:23
complementary skills and interests.
56:26
So, I'm not sure what pros and cons there are of each, being a
56:32
generalist versus a specialist.
56:36
And early on, I didn't want to become a generalist in the sense of having
56:40
just a spattering of knowledge of
56:41
-- Everything?
56:42
A lot of things superficially.
56:45
I made up the term “frictionist.” No, I made up the term "comprehensivist,"
56:53
to be sort of comprehensive.
56:55
You still want to focus on a certain system or ecosystem or geographic area.
57:01
But then try to learn much about it, even in some cases,
57:06
extending out to socio-ecology.
57:08
So, I've done work
57:13
in India and the Congo, the Russian Far East, northeast China, Bolivia,
57:19
Australia, New Zealand, in Canada, and elsewhere too, formally.
57:23
I've done lots of traveling elsewhere, but trying to understand the ecological
57:29
systems, in cultural and human historic contexts; I think it's very important.
57:37
That's all part of being a “comprehensivist,” if you will.
57:40
If you were going to, and this is a take-off on that, and might you
57:43
say that you were just saying it right to me now in another way.
57:46
How would you define ecosystem science - if you were going
57:51
to define it in a paragraph?
57:53
Traditionally, it focuses on
57:58
flows of substances and energy at the ecosystem scale.
58:06
That's really what an ecosystem is.
58:08
That's different than community ecology, which focuses on how species interact,
58:16
diversity of species, in a system.
58:21
Charles Elton's model, right, to some early stuff?
58:26
Yes, MacArthur's, and others, too.
58:28
An ecosystem is the combination of the abiotic realm with the biotic
58:36
realm, which means you have to look at flows of energy, flows of substances,
58:46
hydrology, cycles of nutrients, all that sort of thing.
58:52
That's what a true traditional ecosystem science would focus on.
59:00
And you talked about the SAT study.
59:04
[Scientific Advisory Team]
59:04
Yes.
59:05
And you also talked about Jack Ward Thomas.
59:08
How did you get involved in the Northwest Forest Plan, and I mean
59:13
the predecessor studies and planning, and the whole dynamics leading up
59:18
to that, and its personalities?
59:19
If you want to just kind of take us into that?
59:21
Jack Thomas was my major professor for the doctorate.
59:27
He was at that time an affiliate or adjunct at Oregon State,
59:31
even though at that time he was a senior scientist [USFS] at
59:36
LaGrande, Oregon, over on the east side.
59:38
He was doing his wildlife stuff back there.
59:40
Yes, elk on Starkey [Experimental Forest, in eastern Oregon.]
59:42
Right, Starkey.
59:45
Yet, he agreed to be my major prof. Well, actually, that's not true.
59:52
Chuck Meslow was formally my
59:57
key prof on that committee.
59:59
But Jack Thomas was on the committee, and he and Chuck sort
1:00:03
of served, arm-in-arm, for me.
1:00:11
I used that to become familiar with Jack, and he with me.
1:00:15
I went up to the regional office [Forest Service] and got involved
1:00:18
in the spotted owl program,
1:00:23
and when it came time to establish the Scientific Analysis Team, the SAT, with
1:00:28
Jack Thomas at the helm, he knew of the work I'd already done on compiling
1:00:33
autecology information on full suites of species at the systems level.
1:00:39
He asked me to come in on that project and to do that for the old-growth
1:00:42
focus the SAT project had, and after that, with the ISC, the Interagency
1:00:49
Scientific Committee, on spotted owls.
1:00:51
Which was like a year or two later?
1:00:53
That's right, tiered off the SAT, and he asked me to help
1:00:57
on doing some of that work.
1:01:00
I was not one of the formal authors on that [SAT] , but was on his work crew.
1:01:08
So, bit-by-bit [was more involved with NWFP process] . Then, when FEMAT, the
1:01:11
Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team was formed at the direction of
1:01:16
President Clinton, Jack was the head of that, too, and he asked me to come
1:01:26
head up defining information data-bases on other species, focused on old growth.
1:01:37
I decided we should extend that to all taxa of plants and bryophytes
1:01:41
and lichens, and lots else there.
1:01:43
And I came up with processes to hold rigorous expert panels, to bring in
1:01:49
experts to help fill in information gaps through their knowledge.
1:01:53
This was during FEMAT?
1:01:55
FEMAT, correct, yes.
1:01:55
During the, as I like to call it, the "90-Day Slumber Party."
1:01:59
Oh, geez, slumber party?
1:02:00
I mean, people were almost “camping out” there for like two or three months?
1:02:03
Oh, that's right.
1:02:06
“Big Pink” was the name of the building there that we occupied.
1:02:09
Well, “Pink Tower,” or whatever. [“Pink tower” used most often.]
1:02:11
Yes.
1:02:11
So, that's what you called it?
1:02:12
Big pink, huh?
1:02:12
We called it the “big pink,” that's right.
1:02:14
And I forget what floor we were on, the 14th floor or something.
1:02:16
I think it was the 14th.
1:02:17
Oh, god, I'm having flashbacks.
1:02:21
I was going to wait a little bit to get to that, but since you're in the
1:02:25
train of thought, let's talk about the FEMAT experience, because that's, I
1:02:30
don't know if I'll say it, a one-time thing, because we really haven't seen
1:02:34
something exactly like that happen again, where you had a presidential
1:02:38
summit, immediately followed-up a campaign promise with action.
1:02:42
[Laughter] That's not sarcastic, it's actually unique in the way it happened.
1:02:49
Okay.
1:02:49
Clinton shows up, they have the big summit, and you're charged,
1:02:53
you get sixty days, and then “they” said, we need thirty more days.
1:02:56
You were basically given three months to do this massive
1:02:59
synthesis of all these things.
1:03:02
[Clinton admin.
1:03:02
gave 30 days to create better alternative]
1:03:04
. Right.
1:03:04
So Jack was your conduit, he's the one that pulled you in immediately?
1:03:07
Correct?
1:03:08
Yes, right.
1:03:08
And did you have to drop what you were doing elsewhere and
1:03:12
just go full-time with that for a while, like a lot of people did?
1:03:15
Well, no, I was pretty much doing the same thing, looking at sort of
1:03:19
multi-species planning approaches.
1:03:21
Okay.
1:03:23
We could not have done that part of FEMAT if we hadn't already done the
1:03:27
SAT work and the ISC spotted owl work.
1:03:30
Because that all served as a vital basis, not just a concept, but in fact for
1:03:40
databases through their efforts and we built on them.
1:03:49
So, I think Jack saw that he needed to
1:03:54
build on that, use that, and why not bring in one of the people who was instrumental
1:04:00
in framing all that earlier work?
1:04:02
So, that's how I got in.
1:04:06
Tell me about that experience?
1:04:08
You've got all these science people and really a minimum of management people.
1:04:19
Tell me about the experience conceptually, but then also if you've got some anecdotes
1:04:24
and experiences, throw those in as well.
1:04:26
In concept, we each had our focal areas up on the 14th floor, had our
1:04:31
sections, on this open, very open space, where we had the wildlife folks
1:04:37
here, we had the aquatic and fish folks over on the other side, but they
1:04:43
certainly would direct a lot, too.
1:04:45
Basically, from the wildlife end, there was Marty Raphael, who ended up being
1:04:50
vice to Jack Thomas on the whole project.
1:04:54
He was there with his outstanding expertise and information.
1:05:00
Richard Holthausen, who went by "Holt," someone else I need to unendingly herald
1:05:09
who helped me in my career, and a friend.
1:05:12
He's retired now.
1:05:16
He was part of that, and several other folks, too.
1:05:20
It was not a small team of folks dealing with wildlife, and we all got along well.
1:05:28
We realized this project had to be done in short order, and
1:05:31
we all had the same vision.
1:05:33
If we had not had that, this thing would have folded.
1:05:37
So, I'm just really grateful we had the team there that we did.
1:05:41
We were able to parse out different tasks among ourselves.
1:05:46
I would stay around just to help the framing and structure, the expert
1:05:53
panels, and then, how to consolidate their information into queriable
1:06:02
tables of information databases.
1:06:06
And then, the different sectors, whether it's the aquatic or forestry or economics.
1:06:14
Social science?
1:06:14
In our group, social science, had some time to interact, but I drew up parallels
1:06:22
to that later when I was lead ecologist for the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem
1:06:27
Management Project, over on the east side.
1:06:31
That's another project which was massive and huge.
1:06:34
So, FEMAT
1:06:37
maybe served as kind of a template for that too, in some respect.
1:06:41
Some of the people I've talked to consider it a template in a sense,
1:06:46
the idea of a collective, intense energy, and a focus on something.
1:06:50
Yes.
1:06:51
In that sense, I think.
1:06:52
Now, during FEMAT, every few days there would be a consolidation
1:06:59
meeting we would hold with selected sort of heads of each of these
1:07:09
specialty groups; the aquatic group, our group, social science, and so on.
1:07:13
There was a round table where Norm Johnson and Jerry Franklin would invite
1:07:19
discussions to try to figure out how best to knit all of our findings.
1:07:24
What are the tradeoffs, basically?
1:07:26
That was one of the key things.
1:07:28
In order to provide for greater amounts of old growth to be
1:07:32
preserved in various kinds of reserves, and what kind of reserves.
1:07:36
Then, what are the tradeoffs with timber that could be harvested.
1:07:40
What are the social implications, and so on.
1:07:43
Some of those round tables got a bit testy, as I recall.
1:07:49
I don't want to aim this at any anyone, just that under such a short time frame,
1:07:55
I felt that, especially Norm and Jerry, bless their hearts, knew and felt that
1:08:00
they had to be sort of part scientist and part manager, too, to think ahead
1:08:07
as to what would be more acceptable.
1:08:09
But somebody had to make those decisions.
1:08:11
Well--
1:08:12
Because sixty to ninety days is not very long to come up with a product.
1:08:17
To clarify, the FEMAT team was charged with coming up with alternatives.
1:08:20
We
1:08:22
were not charged with making the decision, or even pointing out
1:08:27
which is the correct choice for
1:08:32
conservation and forestry planning.
1:08:34
From the “green dream” to a more timber harvesting-friendly layout? [referring
1:08:42
to range of “alternatives” in FEMAT]
1:08:42
. Yes, and there's a side point about that.
1:08:42
Back to the project.
1:08:44
There was a management team instituted toward the end of the FEMAT science team,
1:08:54
the management team charged with deciding what recommendation to make
1:09:02
to the directors, the heads of Forest Service and BLM.
1:09:06
It's the
1:09:09
management team, essentially, which amended our option, Option 9
1:09:13
[“alternative”] , which ultimately became the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:09:16
Right.
1:09:18
So, the Northwest Forest Plan was not directly taken from any of FEMAT's
1:09:25
options.
1:09:26
They amended and slightly updated Option 9.
1:09:30
You're talking about the Record of Decision that came later?
1:09:32
Yes, correct.
1:09:33
So, that was a point of policy, a point of decision-making, a point of
1:09:39
sociology, separate from the science.
1:09:42
So, the FEMAT team and science, and yes, it was a very intense time,
1:09:46
but I thought we had the easy part there, to look at tradeoffs and
1:09:52
outcomes.
1:09:54
In a sense, it was easier doing that in a clinical fashion than then
1:09:59
having to take the tough choice to
1:10:03
entertain,
1:10:07
from the decision end, what your decision risk is?
1:10:12
Risk attitude, what you think is playable politically at
1:10:19
that point-in-time, culturally, socially acceptable, and so on.
1:10:25
That was the tough part for them.
1:10:28
How do you view the spotted owl, the northern spotted owl, as a
1:10:34
biological entity, as a philosophical entity, and as a political entity?
1:10:45
It's iconic and an icon in all three of those, definitely.
1:10:50
Traveling around
1:10:53
the world, it's surprised me, how many folks have head of it.
1:10:55
You know, this obscure, fairly small raptor here in the depths
1:10:55
of dark old-growth forest, that many folks have heard of
1:11:11
because of the controversies and sociology involved.
1:11:17
So yes, it is iconic in that sense.
1:11:20
It's also iconic in the sense of raising tremendous hatred
1:11:27
and ire in those early days.
1:11:30
You know, we saw bumper stickers on how to fry a spotted owl.
1:11:37
I think, of course, the media sort of had a role in over-simplifying things
1:11:41
of “owls versus jobs.” And this is the point I want to come back to.
1:11:45
You'd often see headlines, "Owls Versus Jobs," literally those words.
1:11:49
Exactly right.
1:11:50
And so, anyway.
1:11:53
There were two alternatives the FEMAT team came up with that were
1:11:57
virtually identical in terms of the amount of timber to be harvested.
1:12:02
But one had substantially greater conservation value than the other one did.
1:12:07
And I've always pointed it out.
1:12:08
So,
1:12:17
it's not that we tried to grade everything that you were saying
1:12:19
earlier, from “save it all,” to “cut it all,” but the cutoff line is
1:12:24
that the bird is saved versus the bird goes extinct.
1:12:31
Somewhere in there toward the center was an option for being able to provide the
1:12:36
same amount of timber, but have a higher
1:12:41
conservation outcome.
1:12:43
Not just for owls, but for everything else in old growth.
1:12:47
That was the difference that I thought was really, really interesting.
1:12:49
To give you an idea of the legacy of that simplification is next
1:12:53
to our house down in Eugene.
1:12:55
We just had the lot, the vacant lot disappeared, and a house went up.
1:12:59
The builder, a nice guy; we started talking about stuff and I told him I
1:13:04
worked at Oregon State, and it led to a conversation about his family and logging.
1:13:09
He said, "And well, had to go into construction because of
1:13:11
the god-dang owl." [Laughs]
1:13:15
There you go.
1:13:15
I mean, twenty-some years later, it's still that simplistic,
1:13:20
dual-viewpoint that you talked about in the media headlines, for instance.
1:13:23
Yes, yes.
1:13:24
And you and I know the complexities behind the history and the owl and
1:13:28
the biology, and that's really one key factor, and it was actually a
1:13:32
political lever, if anything else.
1:13:34
Quite, that's right.
1:13:35
And it still is.
1:13:36
Yes, if you look at how much of the owl's old-growth forest environment
1:13:41
is left, Franklin says it's four or
1:13:45
five percent, since we had that.
1:13:47
So, what is the incremental opportunity cost of that?
1:13:50
You know, folks can't or don't care to think about that sort of thing,
1:13:54
as long as it's out there, it's still a threat to living and economy.
1:14:01
What if we go ahead and take all the old-growth out, and therefore were left
1:14:06
with a glut of very early-seral stage forest, you have to wait till that comes
1:14:11
back online, so you have to start to buy more, perhaps from Canada or elsewhere.
1:14:16
And so, there are definitely higher order dynamics of this thing
1:14:22
that you have to think through.
1:14:23
Now, we're going to go back to the planning stuff, but I want
1:14:26
to segue into the broader point;
1:14:32
why are old-growth forests important?
1:14:37
For what?
1:14:38
Biological, philosophical; however you want to answer that.
1:14:43
Each of those contexts has an answer.
1:14:47
Where do you want to start?
1:14:49
Where you would like to start.
1:14:54
Historically and ecologically.
1:14:57
There is
1:15:00
this wonderful scientist from the University of Washington, Linda Brubaker,
1:15:05
a forest and paleo-ecologist who researched the geography of old-growth
1:15:12
in Pacific Northwest forests back through time.
1:15:13
In “Climate Change and the Origin of Old- Growth Douglas Fir in the
1:15:16
Puget Sound Lowlands,” she identified Douglas-fir old-growth forests
1:15:19
as having been present in the region for about 6,000 years.
1:15:27
Post-Pleistocene?
1:15:28
[Holocene]
1:15:29
Yes.
1:15:29
Right, so, that puts a
1:15:35
long-term perspective on things.
1:15:38
And folks who now argue we shouldn't worry about climate change, because
1:15:42
if you go back millions of years, the climate has always shifted and cycled.
1:15:46
And no, I don't think they are actual cycles, per se, but
1:15:51
it's always gone up and down.
1:15:52
So, the same thing with old growth is, one could argue that it has short-term
1:15:58
paleo-ecological value, but in the long-term, there was other stuff here.
1:16:03
There were cycad forests and all sorts of things.
1:16:07
Why should we be led to trying to preserve and to fix a condition which
1:16:14
itself over the long term, is labile?
1:16:18
Alright.
1:16:19
Okay, so I'm not sure if that's the history.
1:16:23
That's a great answer.
1:16:25
In the shorter-term, ecologically, in our own lifetimes, yes, these forest
1:16:30
systems host and hold organisms and processes, resources of interest
1:16:40
to us people, ecosystem services you don't find or find very scantily in
1:16:50
other forest types or young forests.
1:16:53
So, there are definitely some physical, biological, ecological attributes
1:16:59
that are different and unique.
1:17:04
If there's an interest in maintaining the full suite of nature, all
1:17:09
species and functions and processes, then they definitely play a role.
1:17:15
Socially and culturally,
1:17:22
if you look at their role in aboriginal interests, and here I’m casting kind
1:17:29
of a global view, in that sense.
1:17:32
It's not just Native Americans.
1:17:35
There is definitely great value in themes and stories, cultural venues, where
1:17:44
old forests are very, very special.
1:17:48
I've lived and studied a lot of these places, for instance, what's
1:17:54
called the psycho-biology of the Garo Hills tribe in northeast India in the
1:17:59
state of Meghalaya, a very isolated far--
1:17:59
Close to Bhutan?
1:17:59
Far west, south of there.
1:17:59
Yes, in the Garo Hills.
1:17:59
The Garo Hills tribe there,
1:18:16
apparently originated some 8,000-9,000 years back from kind of
1:18:23
some sort of
1:18:26
Mongol source, and are very different in language, culture, everything.
1:18:31
I've studied what's called “Jadoreng,”
1:18:36
the socio-ecological religion of the Garos prior to the Welsh coming in the
1:18:43
1800s and trying to convert them to
1:18:50
Christianity.
1:18:52
They held reverence to spirit ghosts, their old-growth forests, old forests
1:18:58
of conifers, and hardwoods and oaks.
1:19:05
There's something majestic about knowing that a living thing has been somewhere
1:19:10
for so long of a period of time.
1:19:13
On an individual organism scale, yes.
1:19:16
Then there's the system in which that occurs, and how that tends
1:19:20
to interact with everything.
1:19:22
When I was working last time in New Zealand, I was asked to spend
1:19:26
time with one of the Maori elders there up on the North Island.
1:19:31
And they were trying to bring back some of their old-growth
1:19:34
Kauri, K-A-U-R-I, forests.
1:19:38
Is it on the North Island or the South Island?
1:19:40
North Island, back into some of the Maori
1:19:46
ownership, and set it up as a big park.
1:19:49
We talked about a metaphor of how Kauri trees, it's been observed that
1:19:56
the roots will share nutrients with
1:20:03
surrounding trees.
1:20:04
And so, I talked about how that could be sort of an analog, for Maori culture
1:20:13
on itself, and helping to share an understanding of the spiritual value
1:20:21
there, of some of these forests with other cultures, essentially with
1:20:25
the European culture, if you will.
1:20:27
So, anyhow, I'm getting off
1:20:33
the continent here.
1:20:34
But yes, I've seen how old-growth forests play many, many important
1:20:38
roles in cultures and ecologically, sociologically around the globe.
1:20:46
So,
1:20:49
the trees back East were much smaller, generally.
1:20:54
I mean, there were a few groves that you would maybe have
1:20:56
found when you were younger?
1:20:57
When?
1:20:57
When you were growing up.
1:21:00
Right.
1:21:00
Did you ever remember going to New England or somewhere, where there
1:21:04
was still some “rump” big stands?
1:21:07
Do you remember anything like that?
1:21:08
That's right.
1:21:08
In Pennsylvania, or anywhere, up in Appalachia, for instance?
1:21:13
Exactly.
1:21:13
My folks would take us, they were just great.
1:21:16
They would take us on cultural trips to visit historic places where you
1:21:22
would see these gigantic old hardwoods,
1:21:28
oaks and maples and
1:21:33
beeches, but nothing like the groves that I've seen out here, or elsewhere.
1:21:37
Yes.
1:21:42
I still remember going to the tree that you drive through, and
1:21:47
I think it's in the Avenue of the Ancients in California there?
1:21:50
Sequoia.
1:21:51
Well, there's one in the redwoods, too, or there was.
1:21:54
[In both places.]
1:21:54
There was.
1:21:54
I think it fell.
1:21:55
I think you're right.
1:21:56
But I remember when I was a kid and went through the Sequoia
1:21:58
one, and even though today [chronologically-speaking] , it's like,
1:22:01
well, don't put a hole in such a big tree.
1:22:03
I mean, that's our view today.
1:22:04
But back then, I was like, wow, that is so cool.
1:22:06
That's right.
1:22:09
It's the majesty of it all.
1:22:12
The other analogy to living things and age is the oldest tree in
1:22:18
the world, the bristlecone pine, which aren't physically big.
1:22:21
That's right.
1:22:22
You go up there on the White Mountains
1:22:26
[eastern California] , it's not like you're looking at a 300-foot-high
1:22:29
sequoia and a redwood or whatever, but you realize how many rings
1:22:35
there are, like 4,000-5,000.
1:22:37
The “Methuselah Tree,” I think is 4,700 years old, something like that.
1:22:42
It's just amazing.
1:22:44
That's an icon of persistence, if you will.
1:22:49
If you look at how gnarled and sort of wind-spun those trees
1:22:55
are, it's iconic, not for the
1:23:04
Greek column feel that you get walking through some of them,
1:23:08
but it is just sheer persistence.
1:23:12
Yes, like when you think about the redwoods or the big firs, you think about
1:23:16
the majestic poetry of Bryant [William Cullen] , or you think of John Muir,
1:23:21
but when you go to these gnarled things there up high, I remember when I was
1:23:24
taking pictures and it was near sunset, and I thought more of Edgar Allen Poe,
1:23:31
you know, Gothic, weird kind of twisted, gnarled shapes and things like that.
1:23:35
It was “beautiful,” but when you reflect on the age, it takes you
1:23:38
to a different space, I don't even want to call it, non-poetic
1:23:42
space, but just a different place.
1:23:44
It's an existential space.
1:23:46
Yes.
1:23:46
I think that's what.
1:23:49
Yes.
1:23:49
So,
1:23:52
any anecdotes or stories in particular about the FEMAT experience?
1:24:00
Pretty much everybody I talked to says a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
1:24:03
Some people say, highlight of my career, was the whole forest plan thing, FEMAT was
1:24:07
a big point, etc. Any particular anecdotes or experiences that were really profound?
1:24:18
You talked about some of the meetings in general.
1:24:23
No,
1:24:28
as I also feel that way about the Columbia River Basin Project.
1:24:35
In the Columbia Basin?
1:24:38
Yes.
1:24:39
I was in
1:24:55
quite a few
1:25:00
big projects.
1:25:03
So, I really don't view it [NWFP] as the pinnacle of my career.
1:25:08
I viewed it as an outstanding opportunity to contribute.
1:25:10
Yes.
1:25:11
Continue going wherever you were going.
1:25:12
Where was I?
1:25:15
Just saying that I see the FEMAT experience as extremely important
1:25:22
to my understanding and career and productivity and contributions.
1:25:26
But, it's just one of a whole suite of
1:25:30
teams and projects that I've been on and am now.
1:25:37
How would you rate the product that came out of FEMAT in terms of what you were
1:25:41
charged with, what came out of it, as it almost seems like an impossibly difficult
1:25:47
synthesis in a short period of time?
1:25:48
But how would you rate the product, in retrospect?
1:25:51
How did you feel about it then, and how do you feel about it in retrospect?
1:25:56
Product, meaning the FEMAT report, the science report?
1:25:59
Yes, the science report.
1:26:00
Or the Northwest Forest Plan that resulted from it?
1:26:02
We'll get to the forest plan, too, but just the report itself.
1:26:06
At the time, I was moderately pleased.
1:26:08
I thought we could have done more and better to ensure greater rigor in
1:26:19
the expert panel evaluations of species' viability.
1:26:25
I thought that some of those, to me, seemed a bit rushed and a bit less
1:26:34
rigorous than they could have been.
1:26:36
And I learned a lot from it.
1:26:39
Looking now back at it, I realize that we didn't, at least I didn't have the
1:26:43
insights, as to the kind of rigor I could have brought to it that I have
1:26:48
now, having run many other sorts of projects with those kinds of panels.
1:26:55
Where I've sort of evolved from that point to a framework that
1:27:02
I think has far more rigor.
1:27:06
So, looking back, I think we did a fine job, whereas at the time, I thought we
1:27:11
could have done more, if that makes sense.
1:27:14
Yes, exactly.
1:27:17
You being a computer guy from very early on, that was one of your
1:27:21
specific skillsets you added to that process, your ability to model
1:27:26
and analyze and crunch numbers and synthesize things on a large scale.
1:27:31
Correct?
1:27:31
Yes.
1:27:33
Although the FEMAT information we had to work with was
1:27:42
very qualitative, categorical information.
1:27:45
It's not like we had absolute amounts of size population, population
1:27:49
densities, and viability quantified
1:27:55
for all the species.
1:28:01
So, I really wasn't able to bring forward those kinds of skills,
1:28:06
you know, sort of an advanced statistical or computational skills.
1:28:12
What would you say the strengths are and what the weaknesses were
1:28:15
of that analysis, that document?
1:28:18
[FEMAT]
1:28:18
Well, strengths were that it was amazingly comprehensive in terms of the
1:28:26
set of all the species and the taxa in
1:28:31
looking at tradeoffs with many other resources.
1:28:35
That's the strength, the comprehensiveness of it.
1:28:40
The weakness was that a lot of it was indeed built on fairly soft qualitative
1:28:49
information coming from species experts, at least from the species end of it.
1:28:55
One might call it “expert opinion” or “expert judgment.”
1:28:58
I prefer not to do that.
1:28:59
I'd like to think that it was expert knowledge, it wasn't
1:29:01
just arbitrary opinion.
1:29:08
Opinion is defined as in some ways sort of faith in something,
1:29:12
not necessarily founded on fact.
1:29:15
That's not what I wanted to do in expert paneling and that sort of thing.
1:29:19
So yes, the adverse or
1:29:27
perhaps
1:29:32
the con side of it was that it was based a lot on information that was
1:29:38
qualitative, fairly fuzzy, not validated through rigorous field studies.
1:29:43
Or peer-reviewed stuff?
1:29:45
Correct, that's right.
1:29:46
Well, you can only do so much.
1:29:48
That's right.
1:29:48
And this was twenty-five years ago, so since then, there's a lot
1:29:51
more things that have been done.
1:29:54
But the decision was to tilt toward being comprehensive, instead of toward
1:29:59
focusing only on information from peer-reviewed studies, which would
1:30:04
have really sort of narrowed the field of what we could even speak to.
1:30:09
I'm glad that we tilted toward comprehensiveness.
1:30:17
Now, you guys finished the charge, then the Record of Decision
1:30:22
[guidelines for implementing NWFP] is put together by a different team?
1:30:24
Correct.
1:30:25
Although there's a few people that might have been the same,
1:30:28
but I'm not sure about that.
1:30:29
There's a lot of moving parts.
1:30:32
I was not part
1:30:36
of that at all.
1:30:36
So, I don't know.
1:30:36
What do you remember about the Record of Decision, or opinions from your colleagues
1:30:42
of what came out of that in terms of the actual implementable document?
1:30:52
In terms of what my scientist colleagues were thinking - is
1:30:56
that what you're asking?
1:30:56
Or even the managers, either class.
1:31:00
I mean, you're obviously, your close colleagues are science people, but
1:31:03
still, you knew people from both sides.
1:31:06
At that time, I think there was enough
1:31:11
division in the old guard
1:31:19
vs.
1:31:19
new-way thinkers, if you will, that there were some who saw it as the
1:31:23
beginning of the end of the economy of the Northwest, and others who saw it as
1:31:30
a herald of the beginning of explicit attention to critical conservation needs.
1:31:39
So, I can think of some folks on sort of each side of that
1:31:47
span.
1:31:48
Now, I want to ask you about one particular part of the Record of Decision
1:31:53
that being, “Survey and Manage.” The reason I ask you that is because you
1:32:00
talked about how you wanted to study everything. You wanted to study the
1:32:04
whole suite. And I've heard it discussed from various people in this project and
1:32:09
outside of it, that, even though that’s conceptually great, on a practical
1:32:16
level for managers, it was problematic.
1:32:18
Yes.
1:32:18
And so, tell me about the dynamic for you, as a person who really
1:32:21
loves to study it all, but then this document goes out there.
1:32:26
And then there's real time and space in the field, and just
1:32:31
kind of how do you do that?
1:32:35
Well, the Survey and Manage Program and the standards came from the management
1:32:39
team, again, of which I was not a part.
1:32:42
When the Survey and Manage Program was instituted, it meant, in part,
1:32:46
holding annual sessions with a ten-person evaluation panel consisting
1:32:56
of five mangers and five biologists.
1:33:00
They would review biological survey and scientific information of
1:33:09
certain species, be they lichens or tree voles or anything, as to whether
1:33:17
they belong on the list of species to garner special attention for
1:33:22
monitoring, and for study beyond what the
1:33:28
aegis of the Northwest Forest Plan would do.
1:33:33
Those species not on the Survey and Manage list were deemed to be adequately
1:33:38
cared for under the general guidelines of the Northwest Forest Plan, the late
1:33:44
successional reserves, the aquatic
1:33:51
areas.
1:33:55
The whole point of it really was try to
1:33:59
find a way to straddle both coarse- and fine-filter approaches.
1:34:05
This was and is still deemed part of the forest planning process.
1:34:12
This is for the National Forest system, not BLM.
1:34:16
Some people mentioned that balance between a coarse and a
1:34:27
fine filter.
1:34:28
That's right.
1:34:28
And so--
1:34:28
The Survey and Management Program was the fine filter.
1:34:32
That's what I meant, yes.
1:34:32
For species.
1:34:32
Norm Johnson's the one who brought that up to me.
1:34:33
He said in some cases it would be better if we used a “coarse filter,” but many
1:34:38
times a “fine filter” gets applied to this particular management aspect.
1:34:43
What did he mean by better?
1:34:45
Better for what?
1:34:46
[Effective management.]
1:34:47
I'm not sure.
1:34:48
Okay.
1:34:49
I'm just taking words out of his mouth, and I'm just trying to
1:34:53
remember how he exactly captured it.
1:34:55
I'm sorry.
1:34:56
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.
1:34:58
I guess my point is that “better” can mean very opposite things.
1:35:03
If you really scale back the intensity and degree focused on individual
1:35:10
species and their viability, it makes it easier to do coarse-filter,
1:35:18
broad-scale, landscape planning.
1:35:20
All right.
1:35:21
It doesn't necessarily mean that if you assumed such species not on the
1:35:27
list are automatically and fully taken care of, then that's valid.
1:35:31
So, what is “better”?
1:35:32
That's what I was getting at.
1:35:34
I probably threw a “value” word in there that didn't necessarily
1:35:38
come out of Norm's mouth.
1:35:39
Let's strike that part
1:35:41
. Okay, that's fine, that's fine.
1:35:42
Okay.
1:35:47
Now, I brought up Survey and Manage,
1:35:52
the management method -- how would you describe that?
1:35:55
What would you call Survey and Manage?
1:35:57
Survey and Management Program.
1:35:58
Very well.
1:35:59
Was a process to identify which old-forest-associated species would
1:36:06
need special attention for monitoring and study outside of what the basic
1:36:11
guidelines of the Northwest Forest Plan would otherwise authorize.
1:36:16
Describe the details of that program and how it was implemented.
1:36:20
Survey and Manage species would fall into one of seven categories.
1:36:29
And the seventh is taking the species off the Survey and Manage species list.
1:36:34
But the other six pertained to what sort of inventory and what sort
1:36:38
of monitoring should be done based on knowledge of the species, its
1:36:45
life attributes, its
1:36:50
occurrence in old-growth forests, its abundance, and other factors.
1:36:58
The Survey and Manage Program process was one whereby this panel
1:37:02
of ten would convene every year.
1:37:06
Ten Forest Service people?
1:37:08
No, not necessarily,
1:37:09
Oh, no?
1:37:09
Forest Service and BLM.
1:37:10
Okay.
1:37:11
I'm trying to think if any were actually outside of those two agencies.
1:37:14
Like the State of Oregon and State of Washington, for instance?
1:37:17
It could very well have been.
1:37:17
Or Fish and Wildlife Service?
1:37:19
Yes.
1:37:19
I think it tended to shift slightly year-to-year, so
1:37:22
some could have come after.
1:37:24
The point was to have five managers and five biologists on it, an even balance.
1:37:30
They would evaluate information on species, either brought forward to them
1:37:35
for possibly being added to the Survey and Manage species list that weren't
1:37:39
already on, or to evaluate species for which new information, new scientific
1:37:44
of monitoring information, had been gathered to re-evaluate whether the
1:37:50
species should stay on the list or should shift categories on the list.
1:37:55
Okay.
1:37:57
Now, I was brought in as they started up the program as
1:38:02
their onsite scientist advisor.
1:38:07
This would be '95, '96, '97, somewhere in there, a year or
1:38:13
two after the plan was actually accepted?
1:38:15
Give or take a decade or two, yes.
1:38:18
Oh, really?
1:38:19
I'm not quite sure of the year.
1:38:21
I'd have to go back to my notes.
1:38:23
For the record, remember, it's been 24 years since FEMAT, and 23 years
1:38:28
since the final plan [NWFP-was accepted] , so it's been a while.
1:38:32
Quite.
1:38:32
We're all grayer.
1:38:34
And thicker.
1:38:35
I
1:38:38
was brought in as the scientist advisor and I would sit on the side and help
1:38:41
guide the facilitator, which at that time was Russ Holmes, who was a botanist.
1:38:47
He did an outstanding job, very careful in the process of the
1:38:52
Survey and Manage paneling scheme.
1:38:56
I was there to help advise him on ensuring that rigor was followed in how
1:39:03
information was brought in, and how the panel was given equal opportunity to
1:39:09
express their opinions and information, and how decisions were finally made.
1:39:16
I actually built a template model called a “Bayesian” network model that
1:39:23
was built on the guidelines for Survey and Manage species determination.
1:39:30
There were six main things that the panel had to think about.
1:39:33
One was the species; was it inside the Northwest Forest Plan area?
1:39:38
And if it's not, then it's off the list.
1:39:41
If it is, go on to step two.
1:39:42
Is it associated or found in old-growth forests?
1:39:46
Now, if it is known to not be, then it's off the list.
1:39:51
If it's unknown and there's some uncertainty, you could enter that
1:39:54
uncertainty into this overall scheme, and that certainly would carry through.
1:40:03
But you can then go on to step three, and then four, five, six, and then
1:40:05
dealing with things like what's known about the inventory, and is
1:40:09
it “inventoriable” to start with?
1:40:13
Is it feasible actually, to inventory the species at all?
1:40:17
Because some of them would be either so small or so difficult to find
1:40:21
and locate on a quantitatively provable level, correct?
1:40:24
Correct, that's right.
1:40:25
And some, like hypogeous fungi, which tend to sprout under the ground.
1:40:31
They're very hard to find unless you dig and know where to dig.
1:40:35
Every five years, it might sprout above ground, when the
1:40:38
sporophytes that are released.
1:40:42
So, those are very hard to find.
1:40:44
Anyhow, so the whole series of these guidelines were in the Record of Decision
1:40:49
instituting the Survey and Manage Program.
1:40:52
So, I basically took that rigorously and put it into this simple system folks
1:40:57
could kind of step through, and then insert their collective answers into
1:41:03
this model up on the screen.
1:41:05
Then we would save that at the end for each species.
1:41:07
So, it was kind of an interactive model?
1:41:10
Quite so.
1:41:11
How interesting.
1:41:12
Then you would save it for each species, they'd have the species name on there,
1:41:17
and say, this is the collective judgment of the Survey and Manage Panel for a
1:41:24
certain species, and here is the outcome.
1:41:26
The outcome would show you probabilities of the species falling into one or more
1:41:34
of those seven outcome categories, with the seventh being that it's off the list.
1:41:40
Sometimes, given uncertainties that feed in, you would end up with probabilities
1:41:45
in perhaps more than one outcome.
1:41:47
So, you could say, sixty percent probability that a species fits Category
1:41:52
A, maybe twenty percent fits B, and so on.
1:41:56
So, the team would have an opportunity to evaluate that and see if further
1:42:03
information and certain inputs, would help to tilt it one way or the other,
1:42:08
or qualitatively change the outcome.
1:42:11
It was sort of a decision-aiding system.
1:42:23
I published that whole scheme in a journal.
1:42:28
And not to focus on that here, unduly.
1:42:31
This is important, though.
1:42:32
I want to know more about it and I think the record wants to hear
1:42:34
more about this, so this is fine.
1:42:36
Okay.
1:42:37
Well, basically, this served to bring repeatable rigor
1:42:43
to the panel
1:42:47
scheme and process.
1:42:49
Again, that's something that I sort of learned from FEMAT where
1:42:53
we did not have that in FEMAT.
1:42:56
In FEMAT, we basically sort of pulled individual experts on each species'
1:43:00
viability expert panel, what do you think the viability level is of this
1:43:05
species under each of our FEMAT planning alternatives, one, two, or three.
1:43:12
Kind of a synthesis and creating a probability calculus, if you will.
1:43:18
Good.
1:43:19
I like that.
1:43:20
Is that?
1:43:21
Yes, okay.
1:43:22
Yes.
1:43:22
I mean, but a probability calculus that would be a little looser around
1:43:27
the edges than a real quantitative scientist would want in the long run?
1:43:33
Are you talking about Survey and Manage?
1:43:35
No, I'm talking about the FEMAT.
1:43:37
FEMAT was not couched in terms of probabilities, really.
1:43:40
It was just
1:43:41
-- But I'm using that as a conceptual [point] , kind of saying, you took a
1:43:44
mean and a synthesis, and you tried to create a probability “thing” that you
1:43:48
could put into this document in a short period of time, that would not maybe
1:43:52
hold up under scientific rigor, if you really took it to its logical extreme?
1:43:55
Well, I guess so.
1:43:56
That's what I meant.
1:43:57
Maybe I'm getting a little loose with my words there, but yeah.
1:44:00
Well, I was going to say that the FEMAT panels were even
1:44:03
more qualitative than that.
1:44:05
Right.
1:44:06
Really, did not try to gauge the level of probability of
1:44:10
viability of a species, didn't do.
1:44:13
Just basically put it into very simple categories.
1:44:18
Now, how did the Survey and Manage seven-step process apply to the different
1:44:23
zoning types in the forest plan?
1:44:27
You had the late successional reserves, you had the riparian reserves?
1:44:32
Aquatic Conservation Areas.
1:44:33
Aquatic Conservation Areas, excuse me.
1:44:35
Sure.
1:44:35
You had the Adaptive Management Areas.
1:44:38
That's right.
1:44:38
And the Matrix.
1:44:39
So, how did you apply or how were you, how did that apply to
1:44:42
the different types of zones?
1:44:44
Basically, it was to look at the LSR's, the Late Successional Reserves.
1:44:48
Just those?
1:44:49
Because we did not address fish, or strictly aquatic species
1:44:57
found in streams inside of
1:45:01
aquatic conservation areas.
1:45:02
We assumed that the aquatic conservation area guidelines were themselves fully
1:45:09
adequate to conserve all the species associated with that part of the plan.
1:45:17
So, this was more of the non-aquatic conservation areas.
1:45:23
And the adaptive management areas, that's a completely different story there.
1:45:27
And we can go on afterwards, if you want.
1:45:30
But this, Survey and Manage, really was focused on the LSR's, I think.
1:45:35
And also, to guide again, the outcome of the category to species under
1:45:42
the Survey and Manage program, A, B, C, D, E, F, or off the list.
1:45:49
Also guided to what extent pre-disturbance surveys would have to be done, if any.
1:45:57
If there was a managed late-successional reserve where some thinning was
1:46:03
going to happen, for instance,
1:46:08
some of the categories would guide as to whether there would be mandated
1:46:16
late-successional, or studies and surveys for that certain species prior
1:46:21
to disturbance, prior to thinning or prior to timber harvest, or burning
1:46:26
or road-building or anything else.
1:46:29
So, did you ever do any
1:46:33
modeling going back in time?
1:46:36
[Bird singing]
1:46:38
Flicker.
1:46:38
Not paleo-ecological, but more recent, where you tried to rebuild past habitats
1:46:43
and use that as a matrix for making the decisions to couch your assessments?
1:46:48
I'm not quite sure what you're getting at.
1:46:50
You're asking me if species we would have deemed species
1:46:54
to be more or less resilient.
1:46:57
Is that what you're after?
1:46:58
No.
1:46:58
I'm just trying to ask, did you try to postulate how things
1:47:02
were, pre-disturbance going back, modeling back in time, historically?
1:47:12
Or was it mainly taken from what happened until now, and then we're
1:47:16
going to look at it going forward?
1:47:18
Looking at Survey and Manage, is that the context that you're asking?
1:47:21
In general, but also Survey and Manage.
1:47:23
Well, Survey and Manage was really intended on looking at
1:47:28
the current state of things.
1:47:29
Right.
1:47:29
Because looking back in time should not influence what the
1:47:35
evaluation would end up being.
1:47:38
Even if you were to say that, well, the species was always rare or it was
1:47:42
once very common and now it's rare, that shouldn't have altered how the
1:47:48
evaluations would be for the current state out there, if that makes sense.
1:47:54
Right.
1:47:55
What surprised you the most about what you discovered during Survey and Manage?
1:48:04
I thought the process was well-done.
1:48:06
It was rigorous.
1:48:09
It was also very involved and turned out to be extremely expensive, much,
1:48:14
much more than I ever envisioned.
1:48:20
Early, I didn't think that holding those sorts of panels and looking at species
1:48:23
information would cost the agency so much.
1:48:28
And that was part of the downfall of it,
1:48:34
just the cost.
1:48:35
The same reason that studying the totality of nature is so hard.
1:48:42
And also, it's kind of like the knowledge of all the different disciplines.
1:48:48
I like to use the example of post-Alexander Humboldt.
1:48:52
In other words, Humboldtian Holism, when “geography” was kind of everything
1:48:57
[discipline-wise] , then you take it forward as the disciplines we know
1:49:00
today have formed [post-1840s] , and the stovepipes [each discipline]
1:49:02
got fuller and fuller and fuller.
1:49:03
Yes.
1:49:04
And within your discipline and between your peers, and you had to
1:49:06
know what was in that stovepipe.
1:49:08
Right.
1:49:08
But also, how they connected to ecosystem science.
1:49:12
How do you do that in real time and space with limited amounts of money?
1:49:15
I'm trying to make an analogy to that, because “Humboldtian
1:49:19
Holism” is a great model for me.
1:49:22
I love what he tried to do.
1:49:25
I mean, he tried to do it in the Cosmos [volume tome] at the end of his
1:49:27
career, where he had, what, five books?
1:49:29
He died trying to do the whole planet, and doing it
1:49:36
as a three-decade-long project.
1:49:39
I'm just making analogy to the difficulty of doing these wonderful
1:49:45
ideas in real-time and space.
1:49:47
It's hard, and it's expensive.
1:49:48
Well, in terms of Survey and Manage, it was this balance between coarse and fine
1:49:53
filters, to put it very simplistically.
1:49:59
Just the cost of doing fine filter work to ensure individual species were
1:50:04
being cared for, conserved or preserved correctly, is costly, especially if you
1:50:10
have to go out and do surveys for them.
1:50:13
Species that are very difficult to find that can be very rare,
1:50:17
that we know scant anything about.
1:50:21
So, where is the balance?
1:50:23
I see that more, as much a question of policy and social
1:50:30
interest, as it is science.
1:50:33
Okay.
1:50:35
Yes.
1:50:35
Pre-Humboldt would have been a fun time for comprehensivists to live, I think.
1:50:41
Because back then, being a naturalist meant that you had to know kind
1:50:46
of something about everything.
1:50:47
I know, it would have been your dream, right?
1:50:49
Yes, yes.
1:50:50
No, that's why, not being a biologist or whatever.
1:50:55
I'm well-versed in it [biology/sciences] , but I love to read some of those old
1:50:58
scientific tracts because they're romantic [style] and easy to read.
1:51:03
I mean, sometimes they're not, but usually, you really see how
1:51:07
the naturalist, the generalist, thought, and you were living in
1:51:09
nature and were a romantic figure.
1:51:12
Well, the heart of ecological science now is quantitative and cold and
1:51:19
computorial.
1:51:20
It really has its origin and its heart in
1:51:28
1800s’ natural history.
1:51:29
If you don't know natural history, then you really can't understand
1:51:33
ecosystems and ecological
1:51:37
systems and processes.
1:51:42
So,
1:51:46
anything else you want to talk about Survey and Manage, how
1:51:49
that evolved and what you saw?
1:51:53
You told me about the positives, but you also told me about a potential
1:51:56
problematic aspect, the cost.
1:51:59
How did that play out over 10-15 years?
1:52:03
Also, in terms of how it affected management.
1:52:06
Well, management chose to abolish it.
1:52:11
It was reinstated by the courts, and then, I think it was abolished again.
1:52:14
I forget what the actual history is.
1:52:16
I'm currently writing one of the chapters for the Northwest Forest Plan science
1:52:22
synthesis.
1:52:23
The twenty-year one, right?
1:52:24
Correct.
1:52:25
And the chapter I'm doing is on all species except for spotted
1:52:28
owls, fish and marbled murrelets.
1:52:32
Murrelets.
1:52:34
Right.
1:52:35
So, I cover everything from soil micro-organisms up through
1:52:41
birds of prey and mammals and carnivores and all sorts of stuff.
1:52:45
And in there, I actually have a section that tracks the
1:52:49
history of the Survey and Manage
1:52:55
Program in and out of the courts, and how it evolved to the “Inter-Agency
1:53:00
Special Status and Sensitive Species Program” that straddles the Forest
1:53:04
Service and BLM in Washington and Oregon.
1:53:07
That's where the Survey and Manage theme now is currently housed.
1:53:13
They don't actually do an annual Survey and Manage assessment, but
1:53:19
they have taken over the heart of the duties of that program.
1:53:31
If it would help, I can even send you an extract from the chapter
1:53:33
that has that history in it.
1:53:36
Yes, I'd like to see that.
1:53:37
Okay.
1:53:38
Thank you.
1:53:38
In fact, I did send you a GTR that I had done with Jack Thomas sometime back that
1:53:43
traces the history up through the ISC.
1:53:47
Did you get that from one of the early emails?
1:53:51
Yes, I have one.
1:53:51
Okay, all right.
1:53:54
So, Alternative 9 was adopted.
1:53:58
How
1:54:01
do you think that the plan, the goals and hopes, came, matched or didn't
1:54:09
match the actual results, over, now we're looking at twenty years,
1:54:11
and we can start to see change?
1:54:12
And if
1:54:17
things have changed, and if you can make assessments at a
1:54:19
generation . How would you assess the twenty-year report card for the LSRs?
1:54:28
Not just LSRs, but the whole, both?
1:54:34
Alternative 9, and you can break it down, however you want.
1:54:39
From the standpoint of the scientists, I think FEMAT was [essentially]
1:54:46
one of their alternatives that was slightly amended to become
1:54:49
the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:54:50
And I'm saying that sort of clinically, because I don't think
1:54:55
that we had any one alternative that we were trying to root for, per se.
1:55:01
You know, if you're very, very conservation-centric, you would want that
1:55:06
which has the greatest area of land of old growth conserved, but that would have
1:55:12
greater adverse impacts economically.
1:55:14
Wasn't that alternative 10?
1:55:15
Weren't there 10 alternatives?
1:55:17
It was called the “green dream,” right?
1:55:18
Yes, yes.
1:55:19
But “Alternative 9” was a little less than that [fewer acres in reserves]
1:55:23
? Yes.
1:55:24
But anyway, complete that thought.
1:55:26
I apologize for the sidebar.
1:55:28
No, that's fine.
1:55:29
But other parts of it, like the Adaptive Management Areas, part
1:55:34
of the program, just never got
1:55:39
underway.
1:55:41
I did some early studies on old growth patches up in the Cispus
1:55:47
AMA, did some studies there.
1:55:50
Up in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest?
1:55:51
[Washington State]
1:55:51
Correct.
1:55:52
That's right.
1:55:54
Aside from that, I don't recall studies going on in other AMA's, at least not the
1:55:59
spirit and the extent that was intended, to have these areas be essentially
1:56:07
used as “silvicultural test” areas.
1:56:09
Laboratories, yes.
1:56:10
Sort of like extensive experimental forests
1:56:16
to test “alternative forestry” and New Forestry ideas,
1:56:21
thinning, all sorts of things.
1:56:24
That part of the program, I think just died flat.
1:56:28
The second part of the forest plan that died flat, was the
1:56:33
intent to have a comprehensive
1:56:38
biodiversity monitoring program, which never took shape.
1:56:42
That would have extended beyond the Survey and Manage species level, just
1:56:48
to decide which of the fine-filter species needed special attention.
1:56:50
But that would be more on a landscape or sub-regional level, right?
1:56:55
I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.
1:56:56
It would comprehensively be the Northwest Forest Plan area.
1:57:00
But it would literally be looking at, shall we say, “landscape chunks.”
1:57:04
Not necessarily, well, maybe part of it.
1:57:06
Okay.
1:57:06
Parts of it might deal with fine-grained attributes of
1:57:11
ecosystems, as we were saying earlier.
1:57:13
What are the energy flows?
1:57:15
What are the
1:57:18
food web sort of attributes?
1:57:22
How that's influenced by fire or climate or harvesting?
1:57:26
Anything like that.
1:57:28
Just look at it from a comprehensive systems level.
1:57:31
That really never took shape.
1:57:33
I guess I can understand that because it was never really well-specified.
1:57:39
And it would have been extremely costly, too, to really implement in full form.
1:57:48
But still, it was in there as one of the attributes of the plan that,
1:57:54
you know, simply didn't take form.
1:57:58
Why do you think the AMA's fell flat?
1:58:00
I've heard different people say different things.
1:58:03
I think a couple of them did okay for a while, and then ultimately
1:58:06
the synergy and the energy just kind of, it didn't go anywhere.
1:58:09
[Applegate AMA in southern Oregon, the Central Cascades AMA near
1:58:09
the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest -- experienced some successes.]
1:58:09
I think the attitude from management was we've got enough land tied up in the
1:58:15
LSR's, we've got so much in the LSR's, in the aquatic areas, especially, the LSR's.
1:58:21
We
1:58:23
don't need or shouldn't have to tie other areas up, too, in some fashion.
1:58:30
So, I think that was a large part of the attitude.
1:58:36
We haven't talked about the interest groups, the activists.
1:58:39
And I'm thinking of industry and environmentalists?
1:58:44
Going on in the '80s, the “Forest Wars,” and the Forest Service was caught in
1:58:48
the middle of this cultural battle.
1:58:51
How
1:58:54
do you see that happening when you were coming up before
1:58:57
the [Northwest] Forest Plan?
1:58:58
Go back a little bit, and then state how that dynamic played out after
1:59:02
the Forest Plan was implemented?
1:59:05
Well, let's include BLM in this, too.
1:59:09
I was going to ask you that later on, but for the record, I'm going
1:59:13
to re-ask an earlier question and come back to one I just asked here.
1:59:24
One of the things that I think was a positive from the Northwest Forest Plan
1:59:28
process, was interagency collaboration where the BLM and the Forest Service,
1:59:38
were forced to come to the table and interact to do something proactive
1:59:43
that maybe they'd never done before.
1:59:46
How do you view the dynamic before, during, and after,
1:59:50
between BLM and Forest Service?
1:59:53
BLM on O&C lands in Oregon, at least, has always been on a different track.
1:59:59
They're in a different department and have different mandates, some of which
2:00:06
do overlap that of the Forest Service.
2:00:09
But well and good, that's part of a legal charge.
2:00:13
It was the overlap areas that I think worked very, very well in FEMAT.
2:00:20
There had been cooperation prior to it, but at this scale, though, trying to
2:00:26
do a landscape plan, this was I think the first of its kind for those two
2:00:31
agencies, in this area, definitely.
2:00:34
Since then, BLM has
2:00:40
little fits and starts as to what degree they want to participate in the full
2:00:46
intent of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:00:48
In other words, they were interested in coming up with
2:00:54
their long-term, old-forest, conservation plan, basically, which they assert
2:01:02
would tend to meet the intent of the Northwest Forest Plan, yet still allow
2:01:06
a different kind of a layout pattern.
2:01:09
Certainly, I can understand the checkerboard ownership they have, with
2:01:14
alternative sections of federal BLM land, versus private and state lands.
2:01:18
State land.
2:01:18
Right.
2:01:20
Is a nightmare to try to
2:01:22
-- Yes, the checkerboard thing
2:01:27
is a challenge.
2:01:27
When teaching students in environmental history classes, it's easy to explain
2:01:30
how the checkerboard thing came to be, but how to realistically
2:01:37
manage that, is another matter.
2:01:38
That's right, that's right.
2:01:40
So I give them credit for trying that, and I've worked with biologists in BLM a lot.
2:01:45
Yes.
2:01:48
But just the very essence of the different sort of charges
2:01:51
[laws/mission] that each agency is based on, means that there's just a
2:01:58
subset area that they truly overlap.
2:01:59
The
2:02:01
Northwest Forest Plan helped to emphasize that.
2:02:05
But I think that since the plan was instituted, there has
2:02:09
been greater interest to have BLM kind of steer back to--
2:02:15
The old way?
2:02:16
An “old-ish” way.
2:02:21
And that gets at, I think, one of the major perceived failings of the Northwest
2:02:25
Forest Plan, is that it simply did not produce the timber harvest it promised
2:02:31
under Alternative 9, or Option 9.
2:02:35
What is your interpretation of why that happened?
2:02:41
Perhaps you should be asking an economist this.
2:02:44
Well, I have.
2:02:45
But I am also asking you.
2:02:45
As a non-economist,
2:02:52
I would hazard it had to do with changes of resource values
2:03:02
in the culture, what sort and sources and quantities of wood that we want.
2:03:13
Also shifts, regionally
2:03:16
or nationally, shifts of international trade, sources of import and export.
2:03:24
That had shifted.
2:03:26
It could be that perhaps it was unforeseen how much of the
2:03:31
timber land was going to be
2:03:36
sequestered, if you will, under the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:03:41
I'm not trying to second-guess any of the economic studies of the time, but
2:03:45
just that I think a lot of people in the public didn't quite grasp at the onset
2:03:53
how much of the area would be in LSR's, given the tiny fraction remained of what
2:03:58
old growth had been there originally.
2:04:03
So, those are some of the factors.
2:04:06
But do you sense that the collaborative aspect forced by the situation,
2:04:11
over the long haul, improved the relationship between the agencies?
2:04:15
The reason I say that is the Forest Service is one of the great
2:04:20
institutions of American government.
2:04:22
It's got the legacy of Gifford Pinchot, the multiple-use paradigm, that even my
2:04:28
wife, a forester from Peru, said they adopted to their needs in South America.
2:04:33
And so, I think sometimes there could be tend to be a little chauvinism built into
2:04:39
an agency with such a proud tradition.
2:04:42
And the BLM, is kind of a “step-child” sometimes.
2:04:45
I'm just saying how it's viewed in the cultural lexicon and how history views
2:04:50
them, and how the attitudes of various agencies interact with each other.
2:04:55
And that you may not have found that to be true.
2:04:57
But, I'm just wondering how that worked in terms of, or
2:04:59
how you perceived that dynamic?
2:05:02
I didn't.
2:05:02
I was not involved in high-level, decision-making venues where the
2:05:10
two agencies had to grapple with common guidelines like that.
2:05:14
So no, I'm not going to agree with that characterization.
2:05:20
Just from my standpoint as a scientist working with biologists
2:05:25
from BLM, it's always been positive, it's always been collegial.
2:05:32
I'm speaking more long duree, or “historical.”
2:05:35
Okay.
2:05:36
Yes, not necessarily what the present is.
2:05:38
Okay.
2:05:45
I'll speak only for the Forest Service and not to point it out as a singular
2:05:51
case-in-point, but as you well understand, any large organization, be it governmental
2:05:57
or private or whatever, that's very large, has incredible inertia, which
2:06:06
means in the second law of Newton, it's very hard to change its course.
2:06:12
It takes a long time.
2:06:13
Maybe that's one reason the AMA's never really entirely took off.
2:06:17
It's very, very hard to change a large organization or institution
2:06:22
to have a very different approach or attitude, in this case, its lands,
2:06:28
or you could say, the taxpayers' lands; they're all public lands.
2:06:31
That's a pretty good way of looking at it.
2:06:33
Because the science people devised the concept, but the managers, who were
2:06:38
kind of on the periphery [planning process] , were the ones that at
2:06:41
least in part had to implement it.
2:06:44
That brings up a really important side point.
2:06:46
And I'm getting us off on another.
2:06:48
No, go, go.
2:06:51
Tentacle here.
2:06:52
But go on, go for it.
2:06:55
I worked a lot in decision-science, and structured decision-making.
2:07:00
The decision process including
2:07:05
analysis of risk, the science part of it and so on, works
2:07:11
best when the decision-maker is involved at the very onset.
2:07:15
And involved in some way in each stage, at least being
2:07:18
informed and helping to provide
2:07:23
perspective.
2:07:23
The Northwest Forest Plan was set up where you had the science team silo-ed off from
2:07:31
any of the managers, as far as I saw.
2:07:34
Yes, it was intended that way, though, right?
2:07:36
Yes, that's right.
2:07:37
They basically separated them, as if you were a manager, you had to wear
2:07:39
like a pink badge [orange vest] or something to come in the building?
2:07:42
That's right.
2:07:43
I remember, I've been told that.
2:07:44
Oh, there were other things worse than that.
2:07:46
The whole point and way it was set up,
2:08:05
was
2:08:10
because they wanted the science to be perceived as being “pure,” not being
2:08:15
tainted by management and policy, as doing their own, pure, honest science thing.
2:08:21
Then, that gets turned over to decision-makers.
2:08:25
Looking back now from what I've done and known in terms of the separate science
2:08:29
and decision processes, it would have been fair to have a decision-maker at
2:08:34
the onset come in and say, here is my expectation, whether it's the chief
2:08:38
of the Forest Service or whomever, saying, here is my expectation, here is
2:08:45
at least a starter kit of my decision criteria, things I want you to analyze
2:08:51
that I can afterwards apply, to know the outcomes under each option.
2:08:59
That didn't take place.
2:09:00
So, the management team who had to come up with the Northwest Forest Plan
2:09:04
based on FEMAT, had one hell of a task.
2:09:08
I sort of honor them for doing what they did, not having been part of those
2:09:15
round tables inside the FEMAT team , and hearing the internal discussion and
2:09:25
debates were there.
2:09:28
That's a very interesting point.
2:09:30
That's one of the things I've thought about,
2:09:34
if
2:09:39
a class of managers, or the managerial class, if they were involved and
2:09:44
invested from the start, there would have been an automatic or
2:09:48
intrinsic interest and investment
2:09:52
. That's part of it, too.
2:09:53
I think that's what you were talking about.
2:09:54
That's right, that's right.
2:09:55
I've thought about that, but you're the first one in these interviews that
2:09:58
have put it in such clear, specific terms, so I thank you for that.
2:10:03
That being said, the chief of the Forest Service did visit the “big
2:10:06
pink” building [“pink tower”] early on.
2:10:09
It was basically a quick preview or review, since the work was just starting.
2:10:20
But that was the only time I recall seeing him there.
2:10:23
Was that Dale Robertson at the time?
2:10:24
Yes, it was Dale.
2:10:26
Right.
2:10:27
Now, Jack became the chief after him, correct?
2:10:31
Or was there one more after him, before Jack Ward Thomas?
2:10:37
Did he follow Dale Robertson?
2:10:39
It was Max Peterson, Dale Robertson, and I think, Jack Thomas.
2:10:42
I think you're right, yes.
2:10:45
Over the years, I have met and interacted with half a dozen
2:10:48
chiefs, as they're called.
2:10:52
I forget the exact sequence, but I think that's right.
2:10:58
Want to continue along that line?
2:11:00
That's pretty much it.
2:11:00
You know, again, in a successful structured decision-management and
2:11:08
decision-science framework, you would want the decision-maker to be involved right
2:11:11
up front with defining the objectives, defining decision criteria, having an
2:11:16
input into maybe the spread of options and alternatives to be analyzed, and
2:11:22
then having a toe in and being informed throughout the whole analysis of steps.
2:11:28
Then coming in again at the end to assert the decision criteria and to be
2:11:34
very explicit and open about what those are, and then how the decision is made.
2:11:40
And from there, that could feed into something like “adaptive management”
2:11:44
learning, or in visiting some of the options and alternatives, and
2:11:49
having a feedback loop there, too.
2:11:51
Anyhow, that whole kind of decision-process is not
2:11:54
what happened in FEMAT.
2:11:56
It was not a classic framework like that.
2:12:00
The science team was separate from the management team that came in
2:12:04
afterwards to take the science team's work and adapt it in a sense.
2:12:08
Do you think it was kind of a classic pendulum swing dynamic where for the
2:12:13
previous decade-and-a-half, the scientists felt not listened to enough, and all
2:12:19
of a sudden, okay, now it's our time?
2:12:23
So, the pendulum swing went there, and then the pendulum swung , but
2:12:28
it didn't get grabbed by both sides.
2:12:30
Do you understand the metaphor?
2:12:33
Yes, but I don't think that was the engine that really started the Northwest
2:12:37
Forest Plan interest and Clinton's Summit.
2:12:41
I think it was just the
2:12:45
expectation of economic values from forests of the Northwest
2:12:50
that was not being met.
2:12:53
Did you go to the Summit?
2:12:55
No, I could not go there.
2:12:59
There was a host of us sitting at the conference room at the regional office
2:13:03
viewing it through closed-circuit feed.
2:13:06
What do you remember your impression of that event?
2:13:08
It
2:13:11
was impressive.
2:13:14
Clinton and his staff were sitting equally at an oval table with Jack
2:13:22
Thomas and others, selected to represent different facets of science,
2:13:29
timber, forestry, economics, and so on, of the Northwest, including
2:13:34
the timber industry and academia.
2:13:37
They were each in turn called upon to provide their input, their
2:13:42
ideas and views, and I felt were given adequate time to do so.
2:13:48
It was impressive.
2:13:52
Now, what do you feel that the timber industry didn't get out of all of this?
2:13:58
A seat at the table in FEMAT, and even this part of FEMAT.
2:14:06
I don't know if others had told you about the day or two where Jack Thomas
2:14:11
gathered up representatives from each of the national forests throughout
2:14:15
the region, to bring in maps and to delineate on these maps where
2:14:24
important old-growth forests were.
2:14:26
[Gang of Four planning process in 1992, a year before FEMAT, but part of same
2:14:29
process] . It was in a large room at the Convention Center in Portland,
2:14:33
and the tables were laid out roughly as the national forests are found
2:14:38
geographically throughout the region.
2:14:41
The timber industry was there, relegated to an adjunct room with a closed door.
2:14:50
Jack Thomas had them sit there, and invited them in only for short intervals,
2:14:56
so they could interact with some of the forest teams doing the old-growth mapping.
2:15:02
It
2:15:04
got to a point where Jack would quip about this, and he put on an orange
2:15:09
vest and drew a target on the back of the vest to quip that he was
2:15:15
being the target of controversy.
2:15:21
I don't know if you heard about that from anyone else.
2:15:24
I heard a different version of it, but tell me a little more,
2:15:27
as that's very interesting.
2:15:28
No, that's all I can say on that.
2:15:29
Oh, okay.
2:15:31
He wore that [traffic vest] . At one point I was sent in to the adjunct room
2:15:35
to bring the timber industry fellows, who
2:15:41
were all male, into the room.
2:15:43
I think it was after the first round of all the old-growth, forest-stand
2:15:47
mapping had been drafted on these maps.
2:15:52
They were brought in to see what the product was at that stage.
2:15:58
You asked the question -- what
2:16:02
did the timber industry get or not get out of this?
2:16:06
And again, a seat at the table at FEMAT, a seat at the table in drawing, defining and
2:16:12
drawing old-growth stands on forest maps.
2:16:17
I think BLM was part of that, too, with their maps.
2:16:20
I'm not quite sure.
2:16:22
So, anyhow, there was that, also.
2:16:28
What would you say happened to timber harvest?
2:16:32
Most federal lands were already locked up because of the Dwyer Decision and all
2:16:36
the lawsuits that were going on before, but in terms of long-term, do you think
2:16:43
the relative exclusion of timber
2:16:47
interests was almost a predictor of how the projections for timber harvest just
2:16:54
didn't happen, and it fell far short
2:16:59
? Saying that, I guess, timber industry was not part of the process.
2:17:04
Not literally why, but symbolic or a predictor so you might say
2:17:13
timber harvest projections
2:17:18
were not going to be met?
2:17:18
Mainly because of the cultural weighting that we're witnessing
2:17:20
here [Culture/values]
2:17:23
. I guess, I'm not entirely sure what you're asking.
2:17:25
Are you implying that the timber harvest projections were biased high because
2:17:31
…? No, just that they weren't met.
2:17:33
I'm just saying, because they [timber industry] didn't have a seat at
2:17:35
the table, perhaps Alternative 9
2:17:41
wouldn't have been chosen, it might have been a different alternative.
2:17:42
And perhaps the zoning thing would have been tweaked slightly differently.
2:17:48
I'm not saying it would have, it's just a speculative question looking backward.
2:17:53
If they were more a part of it, do you think that would have made a difference,
2:17:56
or do you think the world economic forces and environmental activists
2:18:00
would have had play out the same way?
2:18:04
I think we would have ended up with a different forest
2:18:06
plan, if they were part of it.
2:18:08
Right.
2:18:10
In that sense, if it would have met more of their interests, perhaps they would
2:18:14
have played a greater role in trying to
2:18:19
realize it in terms of how it played out.
2:18:25
I don't know.
2:18:26
I don't know.
2:18:29
What about the environmental activist part of things?
2:18:32
What do you remember, meaning you as a scientist and person
2:18:36
with heavy conservation leanings?
2:18:39
What do you remember about watching the “industry” of environmental activism grow
2:18:45
up and mature in the '70s, '80s and '90s?
2:18:52
Well, I'll tell you from a personal perspective, inside the agency.
2:18:56
I felt that a lot of the special interest groups active missions were as
2:19:03
equally vitriolic to work I was doing, as I felt from, say the industry side.
2:19:12
Interesting.
2:19:15
Now, what about environmental activists?
2:19:19
The role they played in all of this and your experience in interfacing with
2:19:23
them, even going back to Humboldt State and on to OSU and the forest plan?
2:19:29
Yes, unfortunately, I think, as well-intended and good-hearted as
2:19:33
some of those folks are, it served to create the image of “owls versus
2:19:38
jobs,” [simplistic dualism] to keep kind of a wedge split there, as if
2:19:44
there had to be either environmentalism and preservation versus exploitation.
2:19:45
During my work in the Southwest, I saw it [environmental
2:20:00
debate] through a different lens.
2:20:01
It was trying to preserve all the red rocks, versus the trees.
2:20:07
Even though I agree with most preservation goals, the attitudes
2:20:16
and self-righteousness and uncompromising nature of it, I
2:20:21
found problematic, even though I am generally very sympathetic of that ilk.
2:20:28
But it's the passion and the unwillingness to compromise, I think that is a problem.
2:20:33
But what is the purpose and the charge of an environmental activist group?
2:20:38
It depends on what group it is, but, yeah.
2:20:39
Well, generally, it is to be just that.
2:20:42
Exactly, exactly.
2:20:43
It is to be extreme and uncompromising.
2:20:46
Right.
2:20:49
I'm
2:20:52
trying to get your assessment of the last twenty years and different factors that
2:20:58
played out under the forest plan, in terms of the timber harvest not working out,
2:21:03
various factors and your opinions on that.
2:21:05
There have been lawsuits by timber interests, lawsuits by
2:21:07
environmental activists, even on small sales in Matrix lands.
2:21:13
Everything's been problematic, even within the context of the
2:21:16
plan supposedly operating in the way it did, or was supposed to.
2:21:19
Right.
2:21:19
If that's okay, I'm trying to get you to answer kind of a
2:21:22
holistic question regarding that?
2:21:23
I
2:21:26
really don't have anything else to add.
2:21:28
Okay.
2:21:32
Now, aside from Survey and Manage, how were you a part of the monitoring
2:21:37
efforts over the last twenty years?
2:21:39
What was your involvement in the various aspects of that?
2:21:43
Virtually nothing.
2:21:44
That was relegated to the National Forest system.
2:21:50
The Pacific Northwest Research Station, of which I am a part, has seen for
2:21:54
quite some time that monitoring is not really a research activity per se.
2:22:00
There are three kinds of monitoring that's pretty much parsed out, and it
2:22:03
was made fairly clear in FEMAT, too.
2:22:11
There’s implementation monitoring, where you check to see if the managers have
2:22:16
implemented projects the way they were
2:22:20
intended.
2:22:25
There's effectiveness monitoring, which is to determine if what
2:22:32
they did had the intended effect.
2:22:35
It's not if they did it, it's when they did it, and did “it”
2:22:38
actually have the intended effect.
2:22:41
If you were to monitor a variable thinning operation intended to retain enough canopy
2:22:49
closure for red tree voles, you go find out whether you still have tree voles in
2:22:53
there, and if the nests are still active.
2:22:58
Validation monitoring, a third part,
2:23:05
is intended to research the underlying causes of effectiveness.
2:23:12
If there are tree voles or not, how or why, and what's happening.
2:23:18
Is it that the canopy is too thin, is it that the species moved out because some
2:23:23
predator came in; these sorts of factors.
2:23:29
So, there's three kinds, and it's always the last of those that really
2:23:32
falls into the aegis of research.
2:23:35
But the other two really are relegated to National Forest system management.
2:23:43
Under the Northwest Forest Plan, essentially all of the
2:23:46
monitoring was the first two kinds.
2:23:49
What would have been the third, validation monitoring, was
2:23:53
through scientific studies.
2:23:55
Not just number counts, but real analysis?
2:23:57
Yes, would have been done on the AMA's, the Adaptive Management Areas.
2:24:02
Okay.
2:24:02
That's where I started doing work on the old forest remnants study on the Cispus
2:24:07
[AMA] , on Gifford-Pinchot National
2:24:11
Forest.
2:24:11
So that answers why I wasn't involved in follow-up with the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:24:16
You clarified some things, too, that I wasn't quite clear on until right now.
2:24:19
Thank you.
2:24:19
Okay.
2:24:24
Y ou mentioned, because you traveled so much around the world,
2:24:30
that people heard about the owl.
2:24:34
How many people in different countries, managers and scientists, are interested
2:24:40
in this forest plan process, and how many of them really knew what
2:24:44
it was, and wanted to know if it was something that they could adapt or
2:24:48
model, not necessarily copy, because every ecology and society is different?
2:24:53
But the concept, in general?
2:24:57
Early on there was greater interest.
2:24:59
I think by this point, there's been enough turnover of some of those other positions,
2:25:06
where folks currently in charge, either haven't heard of it or have deemed it
2:25:11
to be not as interesting or relevant.
2:25:16
But yes, earlier on, there was strong interest, especially from Canada.
2:25:20
Canada had a real strong interest.
2:25:22
Especially, in western Canada, right?
2:25:24
Yes, right.
2:25:25
I was going to say.
2:25:25
B.C. and Alberta, right?
2:25:27
Especially, B.C. I worked closely with folks up there on a series of projects,
2:25:34
science and science management interfaces.
2:25:37
They're very, very interested there.
2:25:41
Also on Vancouver Island, a part of B.C. No longer in play now, but
2:25:50
Weyerhaeuser had a series of forest areas in the north end of the island.
2:25:55
They were doing a series of test cuts using variable density thinning and
2:26:00
variable retention cutting, and different
2:26:08
sorts of enclosed islands of older forest retention.
2:26:14
And some of the scientists up there, biologists such as Bill Beese and
2:26:20
Glen Dunsworth, did a Herculean effort up there studying things and getting
2:26:25
information over to Weyerhaeuser.
2:26:27
Since then, I'm not quite sure what happened.
2:26:29
Weyerhaeuser either sold out or they changed the management operations and
2:26:34
plants, and the last time I flew over it, it was kind of all cut-blocks again.
2:26:40
So, all these areas had been cut out as far as I saw.
2:26:44
But anyhow, Canada, yes, was one of the key areas that had a strong
2:26:47
interest in the plan from early on.
2:26:49
I've even heard that there was some interest from “down under,”
2:26:53
in what was here, even though, obviously, Australia and New Zealand
2:26:56
are ecologically very different?
2:27:02
Yes, I started working in both those places last decade, late last decade.
2:27:08
So, I wasn't there during the early implementation phase of the forest plan.
2:27:16
But yes, there were folks.
2:27:20
I'm trying to think of their names.
2:27:21
CSIRO [Commonwealth Industrial Science and Research Organization] is one of the
2:27:23
government research institutions there that had a very strong interest, and
2:27:29
was interested in adapting it to their
2:27:34
unique old forests there, which are basically eucalyptus forests.
2:27:46
If you were going to give an assessment of the Northwest Forest Plan at 20
2:27:51
years, or it's actually 22 years now, but you're writing up the 20-year report.
2:27:57
How would you grade it in the specific area that you've been
2:28:00
charged to analyze, and anything else that you'd like to comment on?
2:28:04
I think it's done what it set out to do, provide environments and
2:28:08
habitats for a specific species, provide for opportunities for various
2:28:14
types of forest management like to manage late successional reserves.
2:28:18
I would give it close to an F for the Adaptive Management Areas part of it.
2:28:24
But it pretty much has met all the others.
2:28:28
And also, I'd give it a very low grade for the overall biodiversity
2:28:33
program that was intended.
2:28:37
Okay.
2:28:38
So, aside from that, everything else seems to have been met.
2:28:40
Now, the question now, and I sort of find it a job ahead here is to
2:28:47
what extent is it still relevant?
2:28:49
There's a yellow jacket . [Wasp flying]
2:28:49
Is it adequate?
2:28:56
Okay.
2:28:58
How well is it serving to meet the challenges of changes that were unforeseen
2:29:06
or poorly seen during its [NWFP] creation.
2:29:09
Climate change, change of fire
2:29:16
regimes, intensities, frequencies [if there was a nest here or not ]. But
2:29:25
okay.
2:29:26
We're battling a yellow jacket, that's for the record, what
2:29:29
we're making comments about here.
2:29:31
I think it's gone.
2:29:32
All right, we're fine.
2:29:33
Okay, so I'm not sure if you're going there eventually, but
2:29:37
just to poke ahead a bit there.
2:29:39
No, elaborate a little bit more along that line?
2:29:43
Okay.
2:29:43
Support of what I'm doing in currently the final draft of Chapter 6 for the 20-year
2:29:50
Northwest Forest Plan Science Synthesis, is to look at the bulk of all species,
2:29:56
and what's been learned about ecosystems.
2:30:01
And reporting from published scientific work summarizing, synthesizing that.
2:30:09
A lot of work does speak to what was poorly foreseen or unforeseen, or
2:30:15
perhaps you could not foresee back in the institutional days of the plan,
2:30:20
was the possible effects of climate change, and how that changed stressors
2:30:25
on species, on vegetation types, on intensities and frequencies of fires.
2:30:33
So,
2:30:36
a lot of work in that subject area inside the Northwest Forest Plan
2:30:39
area is speaking to perhaps late successional reserves, or not necessarily
2:30:48
going to permanently meet intent of the plan through time, given
2:30:53
all these shifts and changes.
2:30:54
And that perhaps additional reserves or ways to connect some of these old forest
2:31:00
areas across the landscape or especially into higher elevations, especially in
2:31:05
the dryer forest types where fire is prone, these kinds of things might be
2:31:10
considered as adjuncts to the plan now.
2:31:13
So, rather than to abolish the plan, there are other ways to think about trying
2:31:17
to bolster it to meet the challenges of all these other changes happening.
2:31:23
How would you approach bolstering the plan, if you had a say or you have an
2:31:28
idea you wanted to throw out there?
2:31:30
Can you see an area or areas where it could be amended, augmented, adapted?
2:31:41
Not an easy answer because the way we have
2:31:46
done fire suppression, especially in the dry forest types, has radically changed.
2:31:52
I think the ignition probabilities of forests, probably increased the
2:32:02
propensity of the forest to burn, how they burn and where they burn, stochastic
2:32:14
[factors] . We know that more areas will burn and that fire regime type
2:32:21
is going to shift, shifting more of the dry types further north.
2:32:25
So, all these things will have to be considered.
2:32:29
Well, just look at the fire season they had in Washington last year?
2:32:32
Yes, what is happening now.
2:32:34
And
2:32:38
trying to
2:32:41
project that forward.
2:32:43
What do we need for the next decade?
2:32:46
Is that viable for year fifty?
2:32:48
Is that viable to the end of the century, especially if we allow
2:32:54
climate change to continue on its current path?
2:32:59
I think we're already over or fairly close to the tipping point of a two-degree
2:33:03
C increase over pre-industrial levels.
2:33:09
And if we continue to lose the ice, the albedo reflection dynamic may start a
2:33:15
positive feedback cycle that will make it worsen faster than we could have thought?
2:33:19
That could be true, perhaps in the Cascades, not just the Arctic.
2:33:24
Anyhow, that says to me that having ongoing feedback from an
2:33:30
adaptive program integrating management and science, would be the way to go, the
2:33:40
way to ensure we can do the best we can, given knowledge, given uncertainties.
2:33:46
It's still up to management and decision-makers whether it's
2:33:51
the regional forester, BLM state
2:33:56
director, chief of the Forest Service, director of BLM back in D.C., whether it's
2:34:03
up to them as to how to balance social and economic cultural costs and interests.
2:34:11
At least having a program that can look at the dynamics around this whole thing,
2:34:15
this whole system, and try to keep our analyses and models and all current.
2:34:22
That's a challenge.
2:34:23
But I can see an inter-agency program right there
2:34:32
to do that.
2:34:33
So, that's a long, rambling, fuzzy answer to your very interesting question.
2:34:39
That was actually a very interesting answer.
2:34:42
I beg to differ.
2:34:43
So,
2:34:46
now,
2:34:51
one of the criticisms that not just the forest plan [NWFP] , but
2:34:57
also the Endangered Species Act,
2:35:00
come under in the following years has to do with the n orthern spotted
2:35:06
owl's new competitor, the barred owl.
2:35:09
And what does that tell you about the limitations of human
2:35:14
planning and nature being nature?
2:35:17
Do you want to elaborate on that?
2:35:19
Sure, I can envision some detractors of Northwest Forest Plan saying,
2:35:25
see, the forest plan's not working.
2:35:29
It's not serving to protect the viability of the northern spotted owl.
2:35:35
And yet, I would argue back that if you don't have habitat, you
2:35:37
don't have viability, but habitat alone is not necessarily going to
2:35:47
guarantee viability.
2:35:50
So, the Northwest Forest Plan might at this point be essential, but
2:35:54
inadequate, to ensure the continued existence of the northern spotted
2:35:59
owl, at least throughout its range.
2:36:02
So, enter controversy, such as [U.S.] Fish and Wildlife Service and their program
2:36:11
to shoot barred owls in certain areas.
2:36:14
That's a tough one, socially and ecologically.
2:36:17
What's your feeling about that?
2:36:22
Perhaps as test cases in certain selected areas, it would be of interest
2:36:28
to know how the spotted owl spawns . In areas where it has been done in the
2:36:34
redwoods, spotted owls seem to respond very favorably and fairly quickly,
2:36:40
too, if there's still any in the area.
2:36:43
The thing is, once you start doing that, you have to keep shooting barred
2:36:46
owls because they will come back in the area, just like the cowbirds
2:36:51
control program back in the Midwest.
2:36:56
It's a nest parasite that takes over the nest or tends to lay eggs
2:37:04
in nests of endangered songbirds.
2:37:08
So, you go and shoot the cowbirds, they go back in, you constantly
2:37:10
have to have this shooting
2:37:15
program going.
2:37:16
The same principle for me is with the sea lions by the dams.
2:37:21
Right.
2:37:24
To me it is playing God, and sometimes playing God sometimes
2:37:27
doesn't work very good.
2:37:28
So, you asked early on, off the record here, what is an invasive species?
2:37:34
Yes, I said, how do you define invasive species?
2:37:39
Why don't you elaborate on that for the record?
2:37:42
Well,
2:37:45
invasion of a species typically is defined as that which is facilitated by human
2:37:54
introduction and/or transport or spread.
2:38:00
So, the question is, how direct of an introduction does it have to be?
2:38:09
It's been at controversy a bit as to why the barred owl spread west across Canada
2:38:16
and parts of the northern states, and then south down the Coast Range and Cascades
2:38:23
and into the Klamath area of California.
2:38:27
Some say it's because of climate change.
2:38:30
I've read that.
2:38:30
I don't think that's the case, or I don't think that's the primary factor.
2:38:37
Others say, and I tend to agree, that it's probably because humans have
2:38:41
altered vegetation physiognomies, structures so much across the plains
2:38:48
states, across Canada, and then down through all the clear-cutting forests.
2:38:52
That's the whole food chain.
2:38:54
A food chain that also creates early successional and hardwood stands
2:38:59
that barred owls seem to select for.
2:39:04
Barred owls, I've found them in sort of lowland swamp basswood
2:39:08
forests in the Southeast.
2:39:09
I've found them in little mahogany hammocks, little islands
2:39:13
of trees in the Everglades.
2:39:16
In fact, they do like sort of open
2:39:21
riparian, swampish, low-land, valley areas, where they tend to invade first,
2:39:26
and then perhaps they spread upslope.
2:39:30
Are they an invasive species?
2:39:33
Did humans cause their invasion?
2:39:35
I don't think humans actually physically transported the
2:39:39
barred owls from east to west.
2:39:40
Like for instance, the classic one is the rabbits in Australia, right?
2:39:47
Well, that's a little different.
2:39:48
That was actually a physical introduction.
2:39:53
That's what I mean.
2:39:54
Humans brought them in.
2:39:55
Yes, right, right.
2:39:55
That's my point.
2:39:57
I was making a point about, just they were brought in and they all ran wild, like, if
2:40:02
you ever read the book, They All Ran Wild.
2:40:03
That's right, or The Rabbit-Proof Fence.
2:40:07
Yes, right, the 3,000-mile one [Across whole Australian continent].
2:40:10
European starlings were introduced, I think, fifteen of them back in
2:40:13
the early 1800's in Central Park?
2:40:15
Right.
2:40:16
Because the introducer thought it would feel more like home back in Europe.
2:40:21
Right.
2:40:23
They spread coast-to-coast, of course.
2:40:26
Okay.
2:40:26
So that's different, though.
2:40:28
Barred owls, if they spread because of human alteration of the land, are we still
2:40:36
part of the problem?
2:40:38
Kingfisher, I think [Identifying bird near interview place]
2:40:39
. Oh.
2:40:40
I think.
2:40:41
Flying, perched, where?
2:40:42
I think he's on the ground.
2:40:44
Oh, was that a jay?
2:40:48
We're going to take a break for a bird.
2:40:50
Okay, so, continue on that track?
2:40:52
So, are barred owls invasives?
2:40:55
And if so,
2:41:01
is the cause human alteration of the environment which causes their invasion?
2:41:08
The question is not just academic.
2:41:10
It cuts to the heart of the Endangered Species Act, too.
2:41:16
That if we are the cause, then we should be part of the recovery of
2:41:19
spotted owls, perhaps by shooting barreds or doing something else.
2:41:27
I know it's a tough choice.
2:41:29
Personally, I saw it at the onset as a very interesting ecological experiment.
2:41:34
The barred owls?
2:41:35
The barred owls coming in.
2:41:37
I sort of envisioned them as this early flush of an invasive that will
2:41:41
eventually peter out somewhat and retract to more optimal centers and
2:41:50
habitats for them, where spotted owls will find their centers and perhaps
2:41:54
suboptimal environments higher upslope, and they would be able to coexist.
2:41:58
Or maybe that the barred owl is a more of a generalist, might become
2:42:04
more of a specialist, and vice versa.
2:42:05
The spotted owl is more of a specialist in terms of habitat and it might be forced
2:42:10
to become more of a generalist over time?
2:42:11
No, I don't agree with that.
2:42:13
No, okay.
2:42:13
Because that means you're predicting evolution, there's
2:42:14
going to be an evolutionary shift.
2:42:17
I don't think that's going to happen, at least in the short term.
2:42:20
Okay.
2:42:20
And perhaps over the longer term.
2:42:22
Okay, I think that's what I was saying.
2:42:24
But as far as travels around the world, I've seen quite a few places where you
2:42:30
have sympatrics occurring in the same place, two species of owls of the same
2:42:37
genus, Strix, as with barred and spotted.
2:42:40
Somehow, these pairs have been able to coexist in kind of a broad region.
2:42:46
And that's where I look at the barred/spotted case, where maybe we're
2:42:51
seeing the very early stages of that.
2:42:52
And they will somehow sort it out.
2:42:54
Spotteds will probably end up occupying a subset of their range.
2:43:00
But, eventually, they might sort out into somehow a sympatric coexistence.
2:43:07
That's a hypothesis derived from my natural [history] observations
2:43:12
elsewhere, to be put to the test.
2:43:14
That's certainly a good question.
2:43:17
Yes.
2:43:17
And time will tell.
2:43:21
And time's ticking fast, though, because barreds are having a real
2:43:24
strong impact everywhere now.
2:43:26
So, anyhow, that was one of the factors that the Northwest
2:43:28
Forest Plan did not foresee.
2:43:31
Was the barred owl?
2:43:32
The barred owl.
2:43:33
And how fast it was going to spread, and either directly outcompete spotted
2:43:40
owls in certain areas, or hybridize or even prey on them in some cases.
2:43:49
That's again one of the factors like climate change and fire regime
2:43:54
shifts, that the forest plan when instituted did not foresee, and
2:43:58
probably could not to any extent.
2:44:02
So again, I would call for kind of an interagency team of managers and
2:44:07
scientists to reevaluate the conditions and the dynamics of the ecosystem,
2:44:13
and how well the plan is working and to tie into some of the monitoring of
2:44:18
selected species and elements to keep the spotted owl demographic studies going.
2:44:26
They have long-term value to know the extent to which the Northwest Forest
2:44:32
Plan is or is not adequate at this time.
2:44:34
It is necessary, I think, for the goals of old-growth conservation.
2:44:40
Do you think there's any appetite within the agencies involved to revisit the
2:44:45
forest plan in any foundational way?
2:44:47
No.
2:44:49
Next question.
2:44:51
[Laughs] No, I don't think so, given the costs that it took,
2:44:56
you know, social costs, the administrative costs and everything.
2:45:04
Unless there was very, very strong public sentiment for that.
2:45:09
And I don't see that happening under our current administration.
2:45:13
No.
2:45:15
I don't think so, either, even though there are certain people that are afraid
2:45:18
of a super-reactionary push in a lot of environmental management areas.
2:45:25
It's a lot more complicated than just turning a switch.
2:45:28
But environmentalists go out in the streets and
2:45:34
protest, as we've seen protests.
2:45:36
So far in this last half year, they haven't done anything to turn the tide of
2:45:43
any administration I've seen, so I don't think that'll be a factor.
2:45:51
Talk
2:46:20
to me about some of the work you're doing now aside from the forest plan,
2:46:23
it may relate to it or it may not but?
2:46:30
I'm involved in a diverse array of projects, again striving to still be
2:46:38
kind of a comprehensivist involved with lots of different topics and themes
2:46:42
and species and locations and nations.
2:46:46
One
2:46:48
is a project by Scion, S-C-I-O-N, which is the Crown Research Institute of Forestry
2:47:01
in New Zealand, which invited me in 2014 to go start and help them with assessing
2:47:11
conditions conducive to a spread of forest insect pests in their plantations, the
2:47:19
radiata pine stands there, which take up a significant portion of the north island.
2:47:26
A lot of that area has been converted to pine, and they do extensive
2:47:30
exports, especially to China, there.
2:47:33
They have to be sure that the logs that they export are clean and
2:47:37
free of insect pests, otherwise, entire shiploads get sent back and
2:47:42
there is massive economic impact.
2:47:44
It's for the national biosecurity
2:47:48
program for the country, New Zealand.
2:47:52
We have a paper currently in prep on that in which we've analyzed field
2:47:57
data and think we understand what causes some of these insect pests to
2:48:03
explode and to fly, and to spread.
2:48:06
So, that will hopefully feedback and help them
2:48:11
control that.
2:48:12
In New Zealand?
2:48:14
Because just like Australia and New Zealand, they're very susceptible to
2:48:18
introduced species wreaking compete havoc?
2:48:21
That's right.
2:48:22
In various areas.
2:48:23
Yes, you're right.
2:48:24
So, that's one project.
2:48:28
Another is one that I've been working on the past couple years, invited by U.S.
2:48:33
Fish and Wildlife Service back in their
2:48:39
office in Washington, D.C., to come up with a decision-aiding tool to look
2:48:45
at invasive species, especially to determine when freshwater fishes that
2:48:53
could be introduced to the U.S. might get established, get spread, and cause harm.
2:49:01
To identify what species, they want a list under what's called the Lacey Act,
2:49:07
that goes back to the early 1900's, the act that basically lists species to
2:49:13
exclude from allowing be imported into the U.S. We're starting off with freshwater
2:49:18
fish, and from here, we're going perhaps to invertebrates and then, to other
2:49:27
taxa.
2:49:28
If you have a tool, actually, it’s similar to the one I was describing
2:49:33
earlier for the Survey and Manage program to look at species.
2:49:38
This takes into account various ecological attributes of a species found
2:49:42
in its native environment, like fish.
2:49:46
Do they cause harm?
2:49:49
Do they prey on other species?
2:49:52
What's their climate envelope, in a sense?
2:49:56
And do they find the same kind of climate in the U.S., and to
2:49:59
what extent is that possible?
2:50:03
Everything's done in kind of a probability setting.
2:50:06
At the end, you end up with a statement of the probability of an introduced
2:50:10
fish being able to be established, to be able to spread and cause harm,
2:50:15
and collectively, be injurious.
2:50:19
And therefore, that would be presented to the director of the Department of
2:50:27
Interior, I believe, for consideration to list under the Lacey Act.
2:50:32
Okay, so that's a whole decision framework there.
2:50:35
That project is well-under way.
2:50:38
I've got half a dozen others.
2:50:41
I'm looking at the vocalizations of great-horned owls throughout
2:50:44
their range, to see if they do vary.
2:50:47
There's a tenet in ornithology, especially owl ornithology, that owls
2:50:52
have fixed vocalization patterns that they do not vary, that subspecies
2:50:58
of all kind of speak the same.
2:51:02
And I'm finding that's not true, especially in South America.
2:51:06
I'm finding strong evidence that the subspecies down there, Bubo
2:51:09
magellanicus, the Magellanic owl, is actually a separate, full species.
2:51:12
Down
2:51:19
in Chile, right?
2:51:20
Yes.
2:51:20
Argentina, Chile, right?
2:51:21
Correct, that's right.
2:51:23
Probably is a very different species.
2:51:27
The American Ornithologist Union at present does not accept that.
2:51:32
So, if we add some evidence there.
2:51:37
I find that there's a transition of owls, and this is really off the topic here,
2:51:41
we're getting to your wife, of all things.
2:51:44
Peru, the Andes, there's a transition of great horned owls there.
2:51:49
There is B. virginianus nacurutu, to the north, and there's Magellenic [B.
2:51:52
virginianus magellanicus] to the south.
2:51:54
And somewhere in the Andes of Central--
2:51:56
Peru.
2:51:56
Peru, I've
2:51:59
found only one study there where a person has a very small sample size and suggests
2:52:05
there's even a separate species there.
2:52:07
I'm not quite sure from that study, but it's such an interesting spot.
2:52:11
What is their elevational gradient in the Andes?
2:52:14
Oh, excellent.
2:52:15
I mean, it would change from north to south based on how close
2:52:17
they are to the equator, I think.
2:52:18
Excellent, that's right.
2:52:19
But I just, from what you know, just tell me.
2:52:21
I'd be interested in that.
2:52:24
I've found nests in Argentina around the Barros Luco area that's called Los Huecos.
2:52:35
It's an inland lake.
2:52:37
What's the elevation there?
2:52:38
Probably, 5,000-6,000 feet.
2:52:42
They probably range, I guess, up to
2:52:49
9,000 or so?
2:52:50
Just thinking where the corihue [southern beech] forests down
2:52:51
there range further south.
2:52:54
You're getting on to the Patagonia interface?
2:52:57
Yes, that's right.
2:52:58
Okay.
2:53:01
Because in Peru, for instance, everything is higher.
2:53:05
Snow and everything.
2:53:07
I don't know how that affects the life zones of various
2:53:11
species, but you’re right.
2:53:12
Yes, yes.
2:53:12
That's right, that's right.
2:53:13
I mean, you've got to go to 17,000 feet to find the snow.
2:53:19
[Laughter]
2:53:19
Just wait, in a decade, it'll be gone, probably.
2:53:23
Well, a lot of early glaciology [observations] there are now being used
2:53:28
for evidence of climate change, were based on comparative photography [plus
2:53:34
observations-scientists/alpinists] in the high basins of the Peruvian Andes?
2:53:37
Yes.
2:53:38
Because they had such problems with floods and hydrology, and controlling
2:53:42
them on the extreme gradient of the Andes, they did all this work.
2:53:47
And there were alpinists , too.
2:53:49
So, you had those two sets, and then of course, the tropical glaciers are
2:53:52
going just like everywhere else, right.
2:53:55
That's right.
2:53:56
So.
2:53:56
What value the early photos have.
2:54:00
I mean, they don't tell you everything, but they do tell you a lot.
2:54:03
Incredible, a heck of a lot.
2:54:03
That's right.
2:54:05
Speaking of glaciers and climate change, a different project that I've
2:54:07
been doing off and on, a series of projects since 2007, is up in Alaska
2:54:11
in the Arctic and the Sub-Arctic.
2:54:14
Earlier, I was asked by USGS Alaska Science Center to go up and help assess
2:54:19
the global status of polar bears.
2:54:23
That led to us going back to D.C. where the International Polar Bear science team
2:54:28
at that time, gave a series of talks to the White House, Department of Interior,
2:54:33
EPA and others, that led to the polar bear being listed as threatened, globally.
2:54:40
So now, I'm doing a follow-up study looking at climate change impacts
2:54:44
more in the Brooks Range area in the central part of the high Arctic,
2:54:52
setting up a study looking impacts of climate change,
2:54:55
shifts of vegetation up there.
2:54:56
It has spruce forests and shrubs that tend to shift upslope and further
2:55:02
north, and then to look at the influence on predator-prey systems, food webs.
2:55:10
Now, polar bears are having more and more trouble finding ice, aren't they?
2:55:13
Yes.
2:55:14
And some of them are drowning, aren't they?
2:55:16
Yes.
2:55:16
Because they're just too far from where they want to go?
2:55:20
They're strong animals, but they have limits.
2:55:22
That has happened, right.
2:55:22
It's forcing them
2:55:27
more and more, trying to find alternate food sources there.
2:55:31
And that's been, I think, greatly overstated in some articles
2:55:37
where it's been expected or concluded polar bears will now feed on
2:55:43
seabird eggs and things like that.
2:55:45
There's no way
2:55:48
energetically they can get enough out of that.
2:55:53
So, anyhow, the Brooks Range climate change study is now starting up.
2:55:59
And I've got a whole series of other sorts of statistical and various kinds
2:56:06
of modeling studies going on, too.
2:56:09
Tell me about the ecology plexus?
2:56:17
That's one phase of the overall plexus website that I did.
2:56:21
That's just one part of it.
2:56:23
Yes, I know, there's other ones.
2:56:24
I'm just saying, if you want to elaborate on that?
2:56:27
It's a website I started back in 1996, I think, and it’s been on there since.
2:56:32
Back in the old days of the web, of the internet, right?
2:56:35
Boy, it was hand-cranked, yes.
2:56:40
I write all my own HTML, XML code and that sort of thing.
2:56:43
You know, because you had to back then.
2:56:44
There were no
2:56:48
interfaces for that stuff.
2:56:51
And it's a website I do at my time and dime; it doesn't have anything
2:56:55
to do with the Forest Service.
2:56:58
It's a place where I can post and share various interests and all.
2:57:02
The ecology part of it deals with posting, having a place to post
2:57:07
a lot of my publications, some
2:57:14
data, results of studies, speculations on other things.
2:57:21
How, in your view, how has the Forest Service changed in the
2:57:26
thirty-plus years you've been with it?
2:57:28
How would you characterize it?
2:57:30
Obviously, you've got your scientific corner of the agency, but also in
2:57:34
general, if you want to answer that?
2:57:36
It's become more scientific.
2:57:38
And I'm not just saying that from my
2:57:44
biased side.
2:57:45
I worked the first half of my career in the Forest Service inside the national
2:57:50
forest system arm, not in research.
2:57:53
And I worked at the district level, supervisor's office, national forest
2:57:57
level, and a couple of regional offices.
2:58:00
So, I've seen it essentially from the bottom up, and worked as kind of an
2:58:04
in-house advisor or scientist/techno-geek.
2:58:19
Over the years, it's become far more accepting of incorporating science
2:58:24
and realizing it is important to have science that is credible, reviewed,
2:58:29
and can stand up to scrutiny with the public and other scientists.
2:58:34
So, it's become more rigorous, which has been very good to see.
2:58:39
The culture of the Forest Service has radically shifted.
2:58:42
When I first started, there was definitely a good-old boy, white male, dominant
2:58:48
culture with a lot of sexism in it.
2:58:52
I remember many statements made by others,
2:58:59
not just in bars after hours, but in formal meetings, that has radically
2:59:03
shifted, which has been great to see.
2:59:08
Both sexes equally represented, there's a very, very strong LGBTQ
2:59:15
program going on now inside the Forest Service, at least inside our station [PNW]
2:59:21
, trying to bring tolerance, awareness, and equality of opportunity there.
2:59:28
So yes, culturally, it is
2:59:32
nothing like what I first saw.
2:59:38
So,
2:59:42
just talk to me a little bit more about the Columbia Basin project?
2:59:47
You mentioned it, but you didn't really go into it, so kind of segue off the
2:59:52
forest plan into that, and how it led to that, and just kind of how you see that
2:59:57
having proceeded and in your career?
3:00:00
I think it
3:00:03
was an interest to do something at the scale and scope of the Northwest Forest
3:00:07
Plan for the interior of the Northwest.
3:00:12
That led BLM and Forest Service at the national scale to collaborate, and come
3:00:17
up with general directions for what was called the Interior Columbia Basin
3:00:21
Ecosystem Management Project, ICBEMP, or "icy bump", as some people put it.
3:00:30
Difficult to pronounce, otherwise.
3:00:33
It was an incredibly extensive area, like you say.
3:00:38
The study area was the size of France, or bigger, and included land
3:00:43
from the crest of the Cascades east [within Columbia River basin] , and
3:00:46
included portions or little corners of seven states, a big area.
3:00:52
So, it included the Snake River Basin and the Columbia Basin, right?
3:00:54
Oh, that's right, that's right.
3:00:57
Essentially included all of the Columbia River drainage east of
3:01:01
the Cascades and south of the 49th parallel, that is south of Canada.
3:01:07
I was on a further study after this that actually included Canada, and that
3:01:10
was not Forest Service, but a different agency I was asked to help with.
3:01:15
Anyhow, the Interior Columbia Basin project really helped to provide some
3:01:22
science to help national forest planning, some of the BLM planning, and then what
3:01:28
was of interest in Canada afterwards.
3:01:30
The program itself was massive, the Interior Columbia Basin.
3:01:35
It ran on a couple years, two or three years, I forget the exact extent.
3:01:43
The agencies rented a windowless huge quonset hut in Walla Walla, Washington.
3:01:48
And every month, we would drive out or fly out and spend seven to ten days in there
3:01:55
collaborating with other resource areas.
3:02:01
It was the
3:02:05
direction provided by the Washington offices of both agencies [that it] was
3:02:08
to be innovative, to be forward-thinking, to bring in new ideas and new science.
3:02:14
As it turned out, that's not really what was of interest, actually.
3:02:18
What I found, they still wanted to partition viewing each of the
3:02:23
resources as landscape ecology; you had fisheries/fish, you had timber and
3:02:31
wildlife, and economics and sociology.
3:02:36
They were each still out in their little corners physically,
3:02:42
inside this quonset hut.
3:02:45
The interest to do something truly forward-thinking, innovative,
3:02:50
was not well-thought out.
3:02:55
I tried to bring lessons I had learned from multi-species work I
3:02:59
did in California, the Scientific Analysis Team, Interagency Scientific
3:03:04
Committee spotted owls, FEMAT, and then others into this project, and to
3:03:11
look at things from a holistic systems standpoint, to be able to sort of
3:03:15
integrate otherwise very pedestrian, coarse- and fine-filter approaches.
3:03:22
And to move well past that in a truly integrative way, and to look
3:03:26
at ecosystem functions and how species interact and how people
3:03:30
interact with landscapes and species.
3:03:34
I had a very, very difficult time sort of “poking a skewer” into these other
3:03:42
resource specialty areas, even though I knew the people and had worked with them.
3:03:49
The director of the program at last just decided that was
3:03:53
not where they wanted to go.
3:03:56
They wanted to keep things really simple and just look at things
3:03:58
in old-fashioned ways, basically.
3:04:00
You know, what's the viability of each species period, though expert paneling,
3:04:05
the same thing that was done way back in FEMAT, instead of really thinking forward.
3:04:10
Futuristically?
3:04:11
Yes.
3:04:13
So, physically, it was in a difficult spot because everyone
3:04:15
had to funnel into Walla Walla.
3:04:17
They put us up in the Econo Lodge, which was just horrible there.
3:04:21
It was dirty and just not well-kept, and there was no place to eat.
3:04:26
And
3:04:28
it was kind of a difficult thing to
3:04:32
be excited about.
3:04:38
So, it kind of fizzled out for various?
3:04:41
Well, we, as a cooperative team, came up with the first draft of an
3:04:47
EIS for the Interior Columbia Basin area, this huge area that would
3:04:53
serve both BLM and Forest Service.
3:04:57
I don't believe there was a “Record of Decision” [like after FEMAT]
3:04:59
from that or a final EIS study.
3:05:02
I think at that time there was a decision made back in D.C. basically to scrap
3:05:07
the program and to not come up with a plan at that scale for those agencies.
3:05:13
So, it included in all energy flows, hydrological flows,
3:05:19
species, all those things within that area, as much as you could?
3:05:24
Well, that was sort of my vision, to do something from
3:05:28
a holistic systems standpoint.
3:05:32
But it ended up being, you know, chapters in the EIS that dealt
3:05:35
with fish and fisheries, and a chapter on landscape ecology, and
3:05:38
everything was still sort of parsed
3:05:42
out into its own
3:05:48
traditional headings.
3:05:52
So, when did that kind of fizzle out, in what year?
3:05:55
Good question; '97 or somewhere around that.
3:05:56
Oh, so it was quite a while ago.
3:05:58
Yes, it was, it was.
3:05:59
However, a lot of the science that came from it was published in agency reports.
3:06:06
There was a series, I think, in Conservation Biology.
3:06:09
There was a series in other journals, too.
3:06:12
And that was picked up on and used by various factions and forests
3:06:17
and others there, so the science was good, science was used.
3:06:21
What was the most poignant thing that you learned scientifically from that work?
3:06:28
Scientifically?
3:06:34
That one can look at such a vast area from a standpoint
3:06:37
of what I called macroecology.
3:06:39
That's a term that has been used.
3:06:41
I senior authored a
3:06:44
[report] on environment, a General Technical Report, called
3:06:48
something like "Macroecology of the Interior Columbia Basin Project."
3:06:52
Could you go on with what you were saying about the Columbia project?
3:06:57
Yes.
3:06:58
That's one of the things from science, from the standpoint
3:07:01
of trying to direct a program,
3:07:07
massive in terms of geography, the area, and massive in terms of all the
3:07:12
topics this team was trying to cover.
3:07:17
I guess the lesson is to learn how to orchestrate integrating
3:07:22
the sub-teams from the start, and starting off with a common vision of
3:07:30
what was intended to be innovative.
3:07:34
I think everyone had a different idea.
3:07:36
Many were kind of leaning back on old standard ways of analyzing habits
3:07:42
and species and that sort of thing.
3:07:45
So, just from an operational end, I learned a lot that, if I was ever
3:07:50
truly put in charge of that scale of
3:07:55
an effort, I would start off on a very different tack.
3:08:00
The director also had
3:08:04
each of us heading up a different venue of it, like I was the
3:08:08
lead terrestrial ecologist.
3:08:10
He had us attend public hearings and sessions where we'd each get
3:08:17
up and tell what our vision is for what we wanted to analyze and why.
3:08:22
And that was kind of difficult because we really didn't have a collective vision of
3:08:26
how to innovate and what the innovative aspects of this were, so everyone was just
3:08:29
talking from their corner of the resource, if they were brought in to head up.
3:08:38
And worse than that, when we had science, integrative-science sessions,
3:08:42
round-tables, a number of them were open to the public, who would come in and sit
3:08:47
in chairs in a circle outside of ours.
3:08:51
Many of those were reporters, they were industry folks; they were not
3:08:57
interested public “off the street.” They were folks who had a stake in things,
3:09:01
and they were searching for key words and key phrases, things they could use.
3:09:08
So, that made our science interaction extremely stifled.
3:09:13
Because you were afraid that any word could be perceived as being
3:09:18
"loaded" in some manner or another?
3:09:20
Correct.
3:09:21
And when it would get back to your supervisors or the agencies, it
3:09:24
would be all turned upside down.
3:09:29
But there's an example of why maybe the Northwest Forest Plan-FEMAT process
3:09:35
wasn't all that bad of an idea, in terms of just having science people?
3:09:40
Oh, right.
3:09:41
I mean, I'm just going back and inverting the situation, saying, yes,
3:09:46
you can criticize it, but it did allow a lot of freedom, at least in terms of
3:09:50
the intellectual and the scientific?
3:09:53
Okay.
3:09:53
I'll come back at that and say that just because it would have been easier
3:09:56
to do, doesn't mean that it would have been as efficacious and adhering to the
3:10:04
spirit of decisions by not involving interested outside entities or associated
3:10:12
decision-makers from the start.
3:10:20
You finished up talking about the Columbia Basin project and
3:10:23
where it could have gone, and what you would have learned from it.
3:10:26
This is a final question.
3:10:28
Anything else you would like to add to the record about your experience with
3:10:32
the Northwest Forest Plan, the science in the Northwest or in general that
3:10:38
you'd like to add as a capstone answer?
3:10:41
Well, it really helped open my eyes to the need to understand more than
3:10:44
just science, and more than just the little corner of science that I do,
3:10:48
to really try to look at the system as a cultural system, an ecological
3:10:52
system, a social system, economic system, historical system, all of that.
3:10:58
And I don't know that we're really trained as -ologists
3:11:02
to do that, to be very honest.
3:11:05
I think the experience with the Interior Columbia Basin project, which was
3:11:09
intended to be holistic and integrative and forward-thinking, had a good heart
3:11:16
in wanting to do that, wanting to have that holistic view, but it too, failed.
3:11:21
And I think that
3:11:25
is symptomatic of how we learn and how we
3:11:32
train in universities, which are often anything but universal.
3:11:39
We were talking earlier about
3:11:42
Humboldt and pre-Humboldtian holistic views.
3:11:48
That's what I circle back to.
3:11:50
That's really one of the lessons, I think, I got out of the Northwest Forest Plan.
3:11:57
Yes, the establishment of late successional reserves was cutting edge
3:12:04
and inspired quite a few others, and
3:12:11
also served a strong social wedge to create dissidence in some factions, but
3:12:18
beyond all that, it really taught me to do better, to look holistically, at entire
3:12:24
human earth systems, if that make sense?
3:12:28
I think that's a great way to finish the interview.
3:12:31
Thank you, sir.
3:12:32
My pleasure, my honor.
3:12:33
You bet.
3:12:34
Thank you.
3:12:35
Signing out.

[Start of Interview – Part]
3:12:38
Okay, this is Sam Schmieding, again, back with Bruce Marcot.
3:12:42
Same day, same place, different bench, actually, than where we started.
3:12:47
[Laughs] We're in the shade now.
3:12:48
But we're going to answer like one more question, as Bruce brought up
3:12:52
something after we signed off last time.
3:12:55
He said, "Oh, I was involved in that, would you want to know about that?" And
3:12:58
I said, "Yes." So, Bruce is going to talk a little about what we call the
3:13:02
"Gang of Four," which was Jerry Franklin, Norm Johnson, John Gordon, and Jack
3:13:06
Ward Thomas, plus Jim Sedell and Gordie Reeves, the original group that got
3:13:09
involved in testifying in Congress and were actually involved in writing one
3:13:12
of the official reports before FEMAT.
3:13:15
So, anyway, kind of fill in the gaps there where we didn't cover?
3:13:19
Actually, the Gang of Four was Jack Thomas, Jerry Franklin, Norm
3:13:24
Johnson, and—this is terrible, I forget his name, from Yale.
3:13:29
John Gordon.
3:13:29
John Gordon, yes.
3:13:30
My fault.
3:13:31
Jim Sedell and Gordie Reeves were the "Plus Two." I screwed up my intro.
3:13:37
And I never heard of "Plus Two," so.
3:13:39
[Lingo used in Forest Service.]
3:13:39
That's what they call it in the Forest Service, people in there.
3:13:43
They call it the Gang of Four - Plus Two.
3:13:45
The aquatics guys are the Plus Two.
3:13:46
The aquatics, I guess, I was a "plus three" or something then.
3:13:49
Yes, or somewhere out there.
3:13:50
Anyhow, I was brought in to help on that project, which tiered off of
3:13:55
the string of the other ones, the Scientific Analysis Team, and directing
3:14:00
the Science Committee for Spotted Owls, and then, the Gang of Four.
3:14:04
I was brought in to look at the array of species in old growth which could
3:14:11
be favored by having an old-growth conservation plan in the project.
3:14:17
We really didn't come up with a Northwest Forest Plan type or
3:14:21
guidelines from it, but still, it was something that politically
3:14:28
was an important presage to FEMAT.
3:14:31
At one point, when we finished our report, I accompanied the gang.
3:14:42
I forget who else was there; Sedell, possibly Gordie.
3:14:46
Then back to D.C., where we did a day's briefing to
3:14:52
congressional staffers.
3:14:54
So, you were in that hearing?
3:14:55
Yes.
3:14:56
Okay, this is an important omission then, and thank you for remembering.
3:14:59
Oh, okay.
3:15:00
I just figured you weren't there.
3:15:02
Except, it was only the Gang of Four who was sitting at the front
3:15:04
table, and the rest of us were in the peanut gallery in the back
3:15:07
. Do you want to tell me about that whole experience?
3:15:10
It
3:15:14
was positive.
3:15:14
I thought the aides that were asking a lot of the quick questions, they
3:15:18
asked some very poignant ones, but not leading questions, either way.
3:15:21
So, I felt like what was presented was appropriate and honest and
3:15:28
accurate, and what was asked by the aides was very well-done.
3:15:33
It was not slanted toward trying to tilt the table, either toward environmentalism
3:15:39
or toward the industry side.
3:15:42
It was very clear.
3:15:43
And I thought that each of the four [Gang of Four] did an outstanding
3:15:47
job in presenting clearly.
3:15:49
I learned something about that.
3:15:52
You know, that I've since been in that kind of a stance back in D.C.
3:15:58
especially with the polar bear work, in presenting my corner of that
3:16:05
work on the International Polar Bear science team, back in late 2007.
3:16:11
So, that really helped me see the best way to present things in a factual,
3:16:17
clear, vigorous and strong fashion.
3:16:24
Now, do you remember the line of questioning at all?
3:16:28
Vaguely, to be honest.
3:16:29
But it dealt with how sure are you about what you've evaluated.
3:16:33
What are areas of key uncertainties?
3:16:36
How certain or uncertain are you in terms of possible economic impact?
3:16:41
Did you take into account social interests in old growth?
3:16:47
What about alternative ways to meet some of the ecological goals?
3:16:54
Now,
3:16:57
do you remember the moment, or was it during that hearing, or maybe
3:17:01
at a back room, where they added the aquatics “wild card” into it?
3:17:07
Because initially, it was just terrestrial.
3:17:11
And then somebody brought up, but don't forget the fish, or
3:17:15
something along those lines?
3:17:16
Do you recall what I'm talking about?
3:17:17
I don't think it happened during, at least, at the hearing I was at.
3:17:20
Okay.
3:17:21
Yes.
3:17:22
I think it was prior because I think that Sedell,
3:17:26
in fact, I'm sure he was there.
3:17:28
I'm sure he was there because he was sort of joking around.
3:17:32
And I had to point out that Jim, the room is full of live mikes, so.
3:17:38
I heard he liked to speak extemporaneously.
3:17:41
He did well at it.
3:17:43
Yes.
3:17:43
[Laughter]
3:17:43
I did not get to meet Jim.
3:17:45
He passed just before I started this project.
3:17:47
Bless his heart, but yes.
3:17:48
Unfortunate for me.
3:17:57
Big picture question; the Gang of Four Report, the ISC, the SAT, FEMAT,
3:17:58
the whole evolution, big-picture; How would you characterize the evolution
3:18:00
of the knowledge and science in that continuum from the beginning
3:18:07
to the forest plan and even beyond?
3:18:12
Well, it's really interesting thinking as to where we are now.
3:18:15
I'm not sure.
3:18:16
I think up to this point, the evolution has been very positive, and there's
3:18:19
been great strides toward ensuring harder science, and that science can
3:18:25
talk to management, and vice versa.
3:18:29
That's really played out well, like in the Survey and Manage Program I was
3:18:33
involved with, with the inter-agency special status and sensitive species
3:18:37
program that I've also been advisor to.
3:18:42
I am also advising on the development of lists for species of conservation concern
3:18:48
under the 2012 planning rule for the Forest Service, now at the regional level,
3:18:52
involved in coming up with viability assessment tools for species lists.
3:18:58
So, it's evolved step-by-step toward greater and greater
3:19:01
rigor and science focus.
3:19:09
Where things go from here is uncertain.
3:19:11
I feel like almost we're at a climate change tipping point where the system
3:19:17
might tilt one way or the other.
3:19:21
I can't cite any certain circumstance or event on this, but my feeling is
3:19:27
that with the administration where it is, things can suddenly take a
3:19:32
left turn or perhaps right turn.
3:19:37
Or a downturn.
3:19:38
A downturn, yes, that's really implied.
3:19:43
Well, very good.
3:19:44
Anything else along that line?
3:19:50
Yes, this whole sort of lineage as you put it, I think built on all the prior
3:19:56
progenitors, if you will, and it's been really, really positive seeing that.
3:20:03
I've been really fortunate to be part of this line.
3:20:07
And lots of us, as you know, are retired or gone.
3:20:12
So, we're hoping to be able to sort of pass on the spirit of it all.
3:20:19
Well, that's what we're doing today.
3:20:21
So, once again, for a second time, I say thank you.
3:20:23
Super thank you.
3:20:24
Okay.
