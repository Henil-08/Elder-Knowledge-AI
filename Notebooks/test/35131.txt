00:03
Good morning, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State
00:06
University, and College of Forestry.
00:10
I am here in Portland, Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range
00:16
Experiment Station Director's Office, with Cindy Miner, Assistant Station Director
00:21
for Communications and Applications.
00:24
Cindy is a career Forest Service person, as she likes
00:29
to say, for thirty-five years.
00:31
And she's done a whole variety of things from counting spruce budworms,
00:35
as she just told me before the interview, to her present position.
00:38
And today we are going to be doing an oral history interview
00:41
which is part of the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project.
00:47
And so, we're going to be talking about her career, but also the
00:51
Forest Plan and other things that are related to that subject.
00:54
So, good morning, Cindy.
00:56
Good morning.
00:56
Thank you for being willing to meet me today.
00:59
I like to start these things out the same.
01:02
I like to get some biographical information and just kind of have you
01:06
set the table with how you would want to present your background, where
01:10
you're from, and how you came to be?
01:13
Sure.
01:15
I
01:18
have been an employee of the PNW Research Station for about thirty years.
01:27
I've worked for the Forest Service before that as a forester, a silviculturist.
01:35
I've been, however, here in the Northwest for the bulk of my career now, the
01:43
science piece behind the Northwest Forest Plan has really helped shape
01:47
my career for the last few decades.
01:51
I came into Oregon from Minnesota.
01:56
Originally, I'm from the lake states.
01:58
But I worked as a forester in New England on the Green Mountain National Forest, and
02:02
I also was a forest extension specialist with the Peace Corps in Ecuador.
02:10
So, I kind of have a diverse background a bit, geographically, but for a long time
02:18
now, I've been here in the Northwest.
02:21
So, go back to your days in Minnesota.
02:23
Tell me a little bit about where you grew up, and especially your
02:29
relationship to the natural world.
02:32
I grew up in a family that was very much centered around the natural
02:39
world, going camping and fishing.
02:44
My grandparents were both
02:46
members of the Izaak Walton League, my grandmother being the first
02:49
woman member of the Izaak Walton League.
02:52
They raised chickens, my
02:56
grandfather raising them for the hackles for fly fishing, and did so as an
03:02
avocation, with the notion that this really was what he wanted to do.
03:09
He
03:09
had a profession as an attorney, but he retired and then took no money for
03:14
something of a “higher calling,” as
03:18
he
03:22
dedicated his life to genetics related
03:23
to chicken hackles for fly fishing.
03:24
It was quite scientific, as he
03:29
used
03:29
genetic selection.
03:31
Hackles
03:34
that people
03:38
use for fishing today under the
03:39
brand of Whiting are from my grandfather’s stock.
03:42
Again,
03:44
note that my
03:44
grandfather thought this was a high calling, and that interacting with
03:49
nature
03:56
was something
03:59
beyond the material world.
04:02
That's interesting because a lot of people today don't know
04:05
what the Izaak Walton League is.
04:07
Right.
04:07
It's one of the early conservation organizations in this country.
04:11
Today, we think of the Sierra Club or Oregon Wild here locally, that kind of
04:16
thing, but the Izaak Walton League was the old-school kind of conservation.
04:21
Right.
04:21
You know, people that were out fishing and hunting and using nature, so to speak, but
04:25
also had a preservation element in that.
04:28
Definitely, because my grandparents were involved with the preservation of
04:42
the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and played a role in that.
04:47
That's right on the very border with Canada, isn't it?
04:47
Yeah.
04:47
So, I spent much of my youth in the Boundary Waters canoeing and portaging.
04:49
So, when people say, the coldest place in the United States is International
04:52
Falls, Minnesota, you understand?
04:54
Yeah, it's pretty cold, yeah,
04:57
yeah, yeah.
04:59
It is pretty cold.
05:03
What town did you actually grow up in?
05:05
Duluth, Minnesota.
05:05
It's right on Lake Superior.
05:07
Another very cold place.
05:09
Yes, it was pretty cold.
05:10
Yeah, minus-26 degrees.
05:13
With all those parks up there, do you have a special affinity to
05:18
Isle Royale, the Apostle Islands, and those “northern lakes” kinds
05:24
of parks, monuments and reserves?
05:25
Right.
05:26
So I have been on Isle Royale and know
05:32
a lot of the lakes, where the Sawbill Trail is, someplace
05:37
where I spent a lot of time.
05:41
The Boundary Waters; would you call this your first “sacred place” in that area?
05:50
I think it was just simply my back yard.
05:53
Well, okay.
05:53
The whole park.
05:55
I
05:58
can remember being very young and
06:02
these special places just right outside my door.
06:05
But yes, and then we had a cabin on the Black Hoof River which is a little
06:12
trout stream in northern Minnesota.
06:17
That was kind of the family gathering place, and that's where I heard a lot
06:24
of the stories my grandparents told me.
06:27
Like,
06:29
they bought the property from a Swedish logger.
06:32
And my grandmother's father was a logger and logged pine out of northern Minnesota.
06:42
So, I grew up on stories about the forests and trees,
06:50
and did meet the old Swedish logger that had logged the
06:54
land around the cabin property.
06:57
And he would tell stories of being able to look through the forest as far as
07:04
you could see and there'd be big trees.
07:09
Stumps?
07:09
No, this was before, so there'd be just great big tree boles
07:14
and not much underbrush.
07:16
You could just walk, and the trees were very large.
07:23
Growing up, I didn't see anything much like that in northern Minnesota.
07:26
So, I had this real sense of there had been something in
07:30
the past that had been lost.
07:32
And there was, even by the Swedish logger, there was some sense of nostalgia
07:38
for that time when “trees were big.”
07:43
The upper Midwest and the “cut-and-run” railroad logging they did there, was
07:48
one of the sources of the really early conservation movement in this country,
07:52
when Fernow and Pinchot and all those people were reacting, indirectly or
07:57
directly, to the real or perceived timber famine that people were seeing
08:03
in the East, and you heard that word even out here in the Northwest.
08:07
But so, that area where you grew up in was kind of the source of some early carnage
08:12
[clear-cutting/not re-planting] before you were ever around, that led to the roots
08:15
of everything that happened later on.
08:17
Right.
08:17
And I think it very much impacted my grandparents, which in turn
08:20
impacts my parents and myself.
08:22
Yeah, that's why I was going to ask you about the lineage there.
08:25
So, there's definitely a legacy, a
08:30
philosophy I carry with me.
08:36
Your family goes to back to 19th century Minnesota?
08:39
Yes.
08:40
So, they came there right after the logging thing happened?
08:45
No, they were part of the logging.
08:46
Oh, they were.
08:47
So, my grand--
08:48
Okay.
08:49
My grandmother's father.
08:52
I have letters he wrote from the logging camps in northern Minnesota
08:56
to his future wife, my grandmother's mother, my great-grandmother.
09:02
I heard the stories of him going to those logging camps and working.
09:06
He was just a young man when those large tracts of land were being clear-cut.
09:14
And there were some big fires.
09:17
Then I went to forestry school at the University of Minnesota
09:20
School of Forestry [now-Dept.
09:21
of Forests and Natural Resources] . There, I learned a lot of history, and
09:29
the scientific perspective, political perspective, and
09:34
land management perspective.
09:37
But it was initially from first-hand accounts [as
09:49
a youth]
09:50
. Understanding the political and cultural context of today
09:53
is obviously much different.
09:55
How would you describe, I don't know if we can call it a learning curve, but an
10:00
“awareness curve” centered on your family?
10:02
You're talking about going from the grandparents to your parents to
10:05
yourself in terms of the evolution of conservationism, and just
10:10
the philosophy toward humans and the responsibility toward nature
10:14
you saw and experienced.
10:20
In terms of conservation,
10:24
I say that my grandparents were conservationists,
10:28
very much so.
10:30
They saw that people had a role in being good stewards to the land and
10:37
leaving it for future generations.
10:41
Tree planting, for instance, was an activity we did.
10:46
This notion you're doing something that you will never
10:50
receive benefit from was central.
10:51
Even in my grandfather, and his hobby around fly fishing, was
10:56
based in a sense of leaving a legacy for future generations.
11:00
This was very, very ingrained in me in my upbringing.
11:05
Like fly fishermen, who have this very light impact on nature kind
11:10
of perspective when they go out?
11:12
C orrect?
11:12
Right.
11:14
So, if you're going to fish, you realize you want fish for perpetuity.
11:23
That means you're going to take care of the streams, the habitat
11:25
around the streams, the way that you interact with the streams, the
11:29
way that you fish, the way that you
11:35
just sort of your whole approach, is with a notion that you're going
11:39
to leave a light impact, and also, that you might make things better.
11:44
I think there's a notion, for instance, my grandmother having known that her dad
11:51
was a logger and hearing stories from people like the old logger, Charlie, his
11:58
name was Charlie Peterson, who lived right next to the cabin, and he was a bachelor.
12:04
But he would talk about
12:09
how it's a shame they cut all the trees.
12:11
Couldn't they have left some of the trees?
12:13
He had a few trees on the property, but he was very poor at this time,
12:18
and he would have to cut a few trees every so often just to survive.
12:22
To stay warm.
12:23
To stay warm and to sell it.
12:26
He would sell it for a little bit of cash, so that he could
12:30
eat and this kind of thing.
12:32
And my great-grandfather, very much knowing that he had to work.
12:36
He was a young man, and his whole story is kind of as a business
12:44
man, and he needed to make money.
12:47
So, you have the whole big picture coming out of my growing up, and understanding
12:53
that it's a little bit more complex.
12:57
Sounds to me like these awarenesses were being inculcated in you as you were
13:02
growing up, not merely after you became a professional, looking through the
13:06
lens of a conservation-centered career?
13:09
Right.
13:09
Yeah.
13:11
I won't say unique, but that's not always the case when you go back
13:14
that far in history, in terms of the U.S. and how history has evolved.
13:19
My grandparents visited the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
13:25
in the '30s and '40s with
13:35
their three sons, my uncle, and my dad.
13:38
As I grew up, I in turn went with my dad.
13:39
I have diaries and lists of supplies from those trips with my grandparents.
13:42
Now, when was the first time you traveled to the West?
13:49
We traveled a lot to Montana to go fly fishing, and Wyoming.
13:53
My first trip actually was through
13:58
South Dakota.
13:59
We actually visited Mount Rushmore.
14:01
I have a picture of me standing next to the son of Black Elk.
14:05
The actual son of Black Elk?
14:07
The actual son of Black Elk.
14:08
Very cool.
14:10
And then we went down into Wyoming.
14:13
I was about nine or ten, at Kemmerer, Wyoming.
14:16
We had some friends there, and we went fishing.
14:19
We went every year from that time on.
14:23
So, you had an experience with, as I always call it, "big topography."
14:27
Big topography.
14:28
Not just the
14:32
undulating plains of northern Minnesota?
14:33
Right.
14:35
And so, there was an attraction for mountains, perhaps, where you
14:39
eventually ended up in the Northwest?
14:42
Yeah, I worked there
14:46
when I just turned nineteen, on the Colville National Forest
14:51
[Washington] . I was hired to do stand exams, marked timber,
14:58
and spent a lot of time doing prescribed fires.
15:00
I actually lit prescribed fires, and a number of them went out, maybe half of
15:05
the six, and I also worked on a fire crew.
15:08
So,
15:11
that was another exposure to the West.
15:13
That was big timber, a whole different kind of an experience than Montana.
15:20
Isn't that in the Okanagan Valley?
15:20
Well, I was on the
15:26
Newport Ranger District, which was south of Sullivan Lake and
15:31
north of Spokane [Pend Oreille River area, far NE Washington]
15:32
Okay.
15:33
Inland Empire, they call that.
15:35
Now, what do you remember about the national forests in Minnesota?
15:40
I mean, they do have national forests in Minnesota.
15:42
Yeah, I spent a lot of time in Superior National Forest.
15:45
Right.
15:45
And did a lot of camping.
15:48
That's the designated wilderness part of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.
15:52
That is
15:59
a special designation, but it's surrounded by national forest land
16:03
that was harvested, and it had a lot of campgrounds and things like that.
16:06
So, this would have been in the '60s and '70s.
16:08
What do you remember about the dialog and the discussions about land use
16:13
at that early time in your life, and what were the debates in that context?
16:17
My memory in junior high, was all around wolves, because the listing
16:25
of the wolves came about that time.
16:27
And I would read the editorials.
16:29
The ESA [Endangered Species Act] when it first came on?
16:31
Yes.
16:31
So,
16:34
my mom's grandfather had a friend who worked for a telephone company.
16:40
He helped lay the lines through the rural program to put telephone lines up.
16:45
But he had a good friend, who had by this time retired, and
16:51
I went out on his trap line.
16:53
He was trapping wolves.
16:54
And we were out in the snow on snowshoes, looking at his traps.
16:59
So, it was kind of shocking to me, I guess, as I was kind of an animal lover.
17:07
Seeing a trapped wolf?
17:09
I didn't see a trapped wolf, but I saw the traps.
17:11
Oh, okay.
17:13
But on the other hand, I was like, well, okay, this is what people do.
17:18
But that brought my attention to wolves, and then shortly after
17:22
that, they were listed [ESA] . And so, there's a huge political debate
17:29
in Minnesota about whether wolves should be protected or trapped or--
17:35
That's still going on today?
17:36
Well, yes.
17:37
It's quite interesting.
17:39
So, I would read the paper and read editorials.
17:41
And so, that was my first kind of introduction.
17:45
What was your feeling?
17:46
Did you feel that they should be trapped?
17:50
No, no.
17:51
Or not?
17:52
I accepted that this person, who was such a beloved member of the extended
17:58
family in some ways, I accepted that he was a trapper and didn't really
18:03
hold any animosity towards him.
18:04
But I was thinking, “I don't think this is good, there are
18:07
hardly any wolves left.” So,
18:12
that's how I thought.
18:14
So, what do you remember about the logging that did go on in
18:20
the national forest back then?
18:21
Obviously, you were still young and it was before you went to college.
18:27
It was rather small-scale.
18:29
I don't have much of an impression.
18:31
I remember it going on, but had no impression one way or the other about it.
18:38
Literally, across the lakes, there were very few big trees left.
18:41
[Legacy of 19th cent.
18:41
logging in Upper Midwest was early catalyst for U.S. conservation mvt.]
18:41
Yeah, I kind of figured.
18:41
They were
18:44
just trying to figure out how to use the poplar from a vast
18:48
expanse of spruce and poplar.
18:51
There were some pines, white pine.
18:54
Blister rust was coming through, so it was continued sadness and
19:00
mourning about those trees dying off.
19:04
Also red pine or Norway pine.
19:06
They were doing well, and you could watch them grow.
19:10
We planted those.
19:11
And there were some big pines.
19:12
They would harvest some of those, but it was all second, what you would call
19:18
second-growth, in what I had seen.
19:19
Did you have a mentor or a teacher in junior high or high school that inspired
19:24
you in science or about anything you did with your career, a particular person?
19:29
One thing was, I actually had a woman biology teacher, Mrs. DeGrazio.
19:38
I can't say she mentored or did anything special, she just was there.
19:42
And she was a woman, she understood science, and she was a specialist.
19:48
I know that influenced me.
19:50
Because my whole career, I have always been very cognizant that I
19:58
am a woman working in a man's world.
20:00
That has been something I have always had to kind of reconnoiter.
20:06
But when I was young, I did not know that was about to come my way.
20:11
Mrs. DeGrazio and other women I saw in high school might be in the
20:16
sciences or the professions in general.
20:20
Then my grandmother was an attorney, on
20:25
one side, and my other grandmother worked her way up in banking,
20:29
from a banking teller, and eventually became a bank officer.
20:32
So, I had the sense that women had come through it.
20:38
[Laughs] My grandmother voted in the first election that a woman could vote.
20:43
So, post-1920.
20:43
She was 21 years old in 1920, and she cast her ballot.
20:49
I
20:51
had a feeling that there was progress to be made, of course, but I had a
20:55
feeling that we've come a long way, as the expression was in those days.
21:02
Remember the phrase back in the '70s, "We've come a long way, baby."
21:06
Way, baby, yeah, exactly.
21:07
[Laughs]
21:08
Except you can't use the word “baby” any more.
21:11
[Laughs] At least, I can't.
21:14
So, you got out of high school.
21:18
Did you know what you wanted to do?
21:20
Well, I was going to be a nurse.
21:25
I graduated a little early and became certified as a nursing assistant.
21:32
We didn't call it that, we just called it a nurse's aide,
21:33
but now they call them CNAs.
21:35
And I worked at a hospital
21:38
for four or five months.
21:43
I had already enrolled, but wasn't sure I was going to go to college, actually.
21:49
But at some point during that time, I enrolled in the University of
21:52
Minnesota-Duluth in biology, thinking I might go to nursing school.
21:55
But, I was seventeen when I was doing that.
21:59
I actually worked in situations where I was with people dying, and
22:06
that was quite traumatic for me.
22:07
I then decided I needed to do something different.
22:11
Were you like in a hospice ward?
22:13
I was in a coronary care unit.
22:15
I was in an emergency room, and actually in a psych ward as well.
22:19
So, I got
22:26
to see a lot in a very short time.
22:28
You got all the traumatic stuff right away.
22:28
I got to see a lot in a very short time.
22:29
I thought, I don't know if I wanted to be in the hospital environment,
22:32
and I would love to work outdoors.
22:35
You know, I would love to be outside in nature.
22:38
I love nature.
22:38
But it's interesting, even with your early awarenesses in your family, shall
22:42
we say, sharing experiences like your grandmother, you initially chose a
22:46
gender-safe career path that first year.
22:48
I did.
22:49
I kind of kept with that, I believe, in some regards.
22:52
But yes, I
22:55
did.
22:56
And I don't know that I was quite aware of it, but I did.
23:01
Teachers and nurses [Categories “acceptable” for women in previous era]
23:03
. Teachers and nurses, right.
23:05
It was actually my dad, I have to say.
23:07
I said, "Dad, I don't think I could do this." And
23:16
he really did say, "Well, maybe you can look at forestry.
23:19
Maybe that's something you'd like to do."
23:22
Being from the north woods,
23:26
what do you remember about the old-school mythologies of Paul Bunyan
23:34
and Babe, the blue ox, and all that?
23:36
What do you remember about that kind of mythic background being in the culture?
23:43
I just remember the stories.
23:44
Yeah?
23:44
That the lakes came from the footprints of Paul Bunyan.
23:48
I went through Bemidji where there was a big Paul Bunyan
23:52
statue with Babe, the blue ox.
23:56
But
23:58
I guess, if I think about that, there is this man conquering nature
24:05
sort of aspect to all of that.
24:07
And
24:11
that was just a general thing growing up was this, well,
24:24
maybe that wasn't a good model.
24:28
I think that my grandparents gave a sense that there was this
24:33
notion that there could be more.
24:35
We could be raised to a higher level than sort of this conquering
24:42
notion, that there was more to it.
24:43
It's a little more complicated.
24:44
Why was Babe blue?
24:46
I don't know.
24:47
I don't know, either.
24:49
[Laughs] Okay, you're at Minnesota-Duluth, and you're taking biology.
24:56
When did it transfer into a forestry career or track from there?
25:00
Did you stay at Duluth or did you go to the main campus?
25:03
Well, I stayed in Duluth.
25:05
And as I said, over the summer about the time I was going into
25:10
college, my dad mentioned forestry.
25:14
So, I pretty much right away got into the pre-forestry professional program that
25:20
fall at University of Minnesota-Duluth, which would be, you go two years
25:25
at University of Minnesota-Duluth, and then two years on the St. Paul
25:29
campus at the University of Minnesota.
25:31
So, I pretty much went in knowing that's what I wanted to do.
25:36
And then I did it.
25:39
So, you did your undergraduate at Duluth.
25:41
Tell me about a mentor, experiences, a class, or ones that were
25:46
particularly impactful on you.
25:50
Well, I had a great botany teacher.
25:53
I loved my chemistry teacher.
25:54
And those two stand out.
25:56
I had a wonderful geology teacher, and had wonderful teachers at
25:59
University of Minnesota-Duluth.
26:01
It's a small campus.
26:03
The people truly loved what they were doing and teaching.
26:09
And that really influenced me.
26:12
I really liked the sciences.
26:14
I really enjoyed learning about the natural world and
26:18
about geology and biology.
26:22
I did decide, though, I wanted to be a forester, in part
26:27
so I could live in Montana.
26:30
I wanted to get back to Montana.
26:31
So, I applied for all the jobs at all the national forests in
26:35
Montana that winter for a job.
26:39
The summer of my freshman year, I got a job with the Intermountain Research
26:43
Station on a spruce budworm project.
26:46
The one that you told me about before the interview started.
26:48
Yeah, so I worked on that.
26:54
It was a very fun time, and hard work.
26:59
Where is that station actually, exactly?
27:01
Well, that has been merged now and is part of the Rocky Mountain Research Station.
27:07
But they were working, I was working out of Ennis, Montana.
27:12
And so, it wasn't necessarily part of their facilities.
27:16
I was working where they had set up a kind of an outpost there.
27:23
This is next to where now exactly?
27:25
Near Bozeman, Montana.
27:26
Ennis, it's in the south, okay.
27:26
Yeah.
27:26
I worked there.
27:31
Then there was a call for people out of the Colville National Forest to get
27:40
people interested in working into the fall, which I thought was a great idea.
27:45
So, I applied for that and got a job working at a stand exam crew.
27:50
And
27:52
so, I might mention that the first job I had, all the women were inside pulling
27:58
these little worms out of needles, and the men were outside doing the field work.
28:03
I kind of thought that was funny, but Scotty,
28:10
the scientist there, told me that women were good at doing things that,
28:14
you know, required small motor skills.
28:18
And then, I thought I wanted to work in the woods.
28:23
That's what I was about.
28:24
So I applied, saw this as a chance, and I got the job at the national forest
28:30
at Colville, working on the district.
28:32
I had a wonderful supervisor, his name was Darrel, last name was Magnus.
28:40
He and his wife actually let me stay at their house, and he
28:45
was extremely supportive of me, particularly as a young woman.
28:52
He was a silviculturist and had hired a crew of
28:58
four of us.
28:59
One was from inner-city Los Angeles, Torrance, California.
29:08
One was from Ohio, and there was me from Minnesota.
29:12
Then there was one local fellow, Carl Wright, from Priest River.
29:16
He put us together and we did these stand exams.
29:20
Now, I had been working with a woman from Seattle.
29:27
We shared a little tiny hotel room next, at the 5A's Hotel, and she was a runner.
29:36
And, she was on a soccer team.
29:39
She was going to Evergreen College [Olympia, Wash.] . And I had just met her.
29:42
I hitchhiked from Bozeman to Ennis, and then I set up a little
29:47
tent in a park and ran into her.
29:50
Remember when it was safe to hitchhike, [laughs] or we thought it was?
29:53
I know.
29:53
And I rented that space.
29:54
Then we just met there.
29:56
But any rate, I'll get to why I'm telling you this story.
29:59
She was a runner.
30:00
So, I thought, "Well, I don't really like to run, but it was something to do."
30:04
So, I would run with her twice a day.
30:06
She was training for her soccer team.
30:08
So when I got to the Colville, I was in pretty good shape.
30:11
But Ennis is about a mile high, and I'd been doing running and
30:14
working out with her a little bit.
30:16
And so, I got there and I'm on
30:20
this field crew.
30:22
They really wanted to put me through the paces, but I was able to keep up.
30:28
Then we were going to do the stand exam crew work, and then, they decided
30:35
they have all this slash they needed to burn, huge, 100 to 200-acre clear-cuts
30:43
on very steep slopes full of debris.
30:47
And some of my work was doing regeneration surveys, actually going
30:53
into that and looking for regeneration.
30:55
Natural regeneration?
30:57
But they weren't getting good results.
30:59
They needed to get rid of the slash, they decided.
31:01
So, they'd have these prescribed fires.
31:04
My boss said,
31:09
"Well, she can do that.
31:10
Even though she’s woman, she can be on the fire crew."
31:15
There was some component of that district that said we don’t want women
31:19
working on fire, but the direction was that everyone on district field
31:22
crews was going to participate.
31:24
There were two women on a different part of the district working for the
31:28
survey crew, and there was myself.
31:31
I never really ran into those two women, but I knew they were there.
31:36
So, they gave me this step test.
31:39
It was a man's step test.
31:41
They gave it to me once, they gave it to me twice, they gave it to me three times.
31:46
I passed every time.
31:47
They were trying to see if you would fail so they could give an excuse to not?
31:51
[Have Miner to work on fires.]
31:51
I don't know.
31:52
I won't presuppose why they made me take it three times, but the third time, they
31:57
brought in the ranger to watch me take it.
32:02
[Laughs] I passed it, and they're like, "Okay, I guess, she's going to fight
32:06
fires." And then I got out there with a little bit of training, and was out.
32:14
Even when I was going out into the field, I could hear this conversation
32:18
between my boss and somebody else saying, "You've got to get her out of
32:22
there." And him [the boss] arguing, "No!"
32:25
Well, they didn't even let women run the marathon in the Olympics back then.
32:29
Remember?
32:30
Yeah.
32:32
Just kind of a parallel there.
32:34
And so, it was very interesting.
32:37
I took it rather in stride at this point.
32:39
And I enjoyed my crew.
32:42
My crew was very good.
32:44
We bonded and I never felt any judgment.
32:48
We were
32:52
kind of all equal, on equal terms, an equal basis.
32:55
Because firefighting, it's still kind of a macho culture, even today,
33:01
maybe less so than back in the '70s.
33:03
Wouldn't you characterize it that way?
33:07
This was really not a
33:14
formal fire crew.
33:16
You're going to get me talking here, but this is just the group from the
33:18
district assigned to prescribed burning.
33:20
Everyone from the district was there, including field crews.
33:23
I remember some were from the
33:29
Colville [Indian] Reservation, too.
33:34
I could talk a long time about prescribed burning because of things
33:41
that happened.
33:42
This included my first fire, which jumped the line, and was very serious.
33:48
Did you almost get trapped?
33:50
I was trapped.
33:51
They had to pull us out with a human chain, eventually.
33:56
I really did see my life pass before me on the first fire
34:00
I was on, because it jumped.
34:03
It wasn't set properly.
34:04
I learned that later when I went to forestry school.
34:06
I know exactly what they did wrong.
34:10
They didn't set it properly, and it created a situation where they
34:15
set us up in a really bad spot.
34:18
Did the winds change or something?
34:23
The winds just went uphill.
34:26
It was the shape of this clear-cut, and it was like an L-shape.
34:32
I was in the elbow of the L. And there were trees on the L,
34:40
like the lower part of that.
34:42
When the wind came up from below, it jumped into the trees because
34:48
that's the way wind goes, it goes up like that when you set a fire.
34:53
They didn't time it right and set it right.
34:56
At any rate.
34:57
That must have been a very powerful experience for you?
35:01
Yeah, it was, extremely so.
35:03
I mean, a grounding, “be grateful for every day” kind of a moment?
35:09
Yeah.
35:12
Kind of
35:14
a bit that way.
35:15
But
35:17
also,
35:21
I was just happy to be alive.
35:23
I had a great time after that.
35:27
I actually enjoyed it, and the full fire thing was very exciting to me.
35:32
I ended up
35:34
on the night crew and various things.
35:37
So, when you see or read about disasters where people actually do die, it really
35:43
has extra resonance for you, doesn't it?
35:44
Oh, it just kind of breaks my heart
35:51
every time when I hear about young people, in particular, being
35:56
out there on a fire and dying.
35:59
It just breaks my heart.
36:01
I really identify with that.
36:05
What do you remember about your early days in forestry school and when you're out
36:10
in these big western national forests?
36:12
What do you remember about the management paradigms and what you heard and saw, and
36:17
your impressions about what was going on?
36:19
Obviously, you've got the context of hindsight today of a lifetime-career
36:24
in natural resource management, but what do you remember at the time?
36:30
They're doing it this way or that way, or do you remember about the
36:33
discussions that were going on within the local forests and districts?
36:41
I felt myself going into a real observation mode.
36:45
I
36:49
withheld [judgement] , and was thinking, let's see how this all really works.
36:58
I was there
37:02
working in incredibly ugly clear-cuts at a time when people were protesting
37:08
clear-cuts, and the environmental movement was just starting to get some teeth.
37:14
It was before the “Forest Wars” [1980s-1990s] here were really
37:17
at their high point, but the momentum nationally was building.
37:20
Correct?
37:21
Yes, it was.
37:22
I would see publications where they would show clear-cuts
37:32
that were part of packages people were putting together to
37:38
fight these big clear-cuts.
37:43
How were you observing what was going on, and what conclusions, however early and
37:44
nascent, were coming to you at that point?
37:47
Or
37:52
your perceptions, shall we say, that's a better way to characterize.
37:58
My perceptions were,
38:02
when I was on the Colville,
38:07
I really, truly, was just taking it in.
38:08
I was seeing, how does this really work?
38:10
How does this really work?
38:12
I was going into forestry school.
38:15
I was working on a stand exam crew.
38:17
So it was like, gosh, we're measuring the trees, we're
38:19
looking at how they're growing.
38:22
I was working in these clear-cuts, and it just didn't feel right to me
38:27
there are these big clear-cuts, and they have to do all this trouble
38:30
with the prescribed burning.
38:33
But it was clear to me they were trying to do that, so they could
38:37
replant these trees, they were going to replant these clear-cuts.
38:41
So, there was this sense that they were, that it was part of an effort to
38:48
regenerate and bring back the forest.
38:50
And I actually marked a shelterwood [alternative
38:56
method to clear-cutting] , spent weeks marking a shelterwood cut.
38:59
I also had a sense, okay, they are clear-cutting here, they're looking
39:02
at other methods, and there's a mix of ways they're doing this.
39:07
I'd just turned nineteen and was sort of taking it all in.
39:14
Even at the H.J. Andrews, and I'm doing the project on all their archives; they
39:18
start using shelterwood cuts in the '70s, just as the IBP [International Biological
39:22
Program] and then later, the LTER [Long-Term Ecological Research] program
39:27
was coming on, kind of a lighter-touch logging philosophy at that time.
39:33
So yeah, it was in the '70s.
39:36
Then, I got on the coop-ed program and went on the Green Mountain National
39:41
Forest, which is in New England.
39:43
So there, there are lots of shelterwoods.
39:47
And I had fun with doing prescriptions.
39:51
We did patch cuts, and we were tapping, with special-use permits, maple trees.
40:00
When I was out there, it was totally different than the Lake
40:07
States, or definitely, the West.
40:12
That is actually where I spent a lot of my formative time as a forester,
40:18
because I did that after my junior year.
40:24
And the ecology was completely different.
40:27
You had a much more mixed deciduous and some conifers mixed in,
40:31
especially in the higher elevations?
40:34
Well, the conifers, you find red spruce at a little bit higher elevation, and then on
40:40
the hillsides, you've got pine and maple.
40:43
So, it kind of depends on the quality of the site, regarding
40:46
the kind of trees you have.
40:48
But it was the kind of a place you had to do some kind of selective management.
40:55
Because it wasn't the big tree, I won't say monocultural, but where it's treated
41:00
almost monoculturally out West, where you had that before the 1980s and 1990s
41:06
with such a mixture of species and uses.
41:09
I'm not sure that is the driver, the number of species.
41:15
But the hardwood component, I think, would be
41:21
part of it.
41:28
But there was a sense that Douglas-fir needed full sunlight, and that it was
41:36
a tree that if you clear-cut and you plant it, that was the best way to grow it.
41:40
That was true of some species as well in New England.
41:46
We did use clear-cutting, for example, in trying to bring
41:49
back birch for woodcock habitat.
41:53
We were using clear-cuts for that.
41:56
It kind of depends on what your end objective was.
41:57
What I did learn was, it depends on what you wanted, and what
42:00
you're trying to accomplish.
42:02
And there are different things to be accomplished.
42:05
And clear-cuts are not always bad?
42:07
No, and if you want to bring back birch, if you want woodcock habitat, you really
42:15
want birch, you're going to have to probably use a clear-cut to get that back.
42:18
At least, where we were.
42:22
So, you're going through school.
42:23
You're bouncing around the northern United States from east to west.
42:29
You're in New England, you go back to graduate school,
42:32
correct, in what year, '70?
42:33
What was the year?
42:34
I graduated in '78.
42:34
'78.
42:34
With
42:38
my forestry degree, and then, I went back and worked in Vermont
42:42
for a few years as a forester.
42:44
Okay.
42:45
Working in silviculture and a variety of things.
42:47
It was a small district so I got to do a variety of things.
42:49
Were you up in the White Mountains in the north?
42:51
I went to silviculture training in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
42:54
Oh, okay.
42:55
I was in the Green Mountains of Vermont.
42:57
Green Mountains of Vermont, excuse me.
42:58
I always get those mixed up.
42:59
Yeah.
43:00
Vermont, New Hampshire, White Mountains, Green Mountains.
43:02
Okay.
43:03
It's easy to get mixed up.
43:04
The only reason I don't is because I was there.
43:08
And I'm a geography guy, and I still get it confused today.
43:11
Anyway.
43:12
Yeah, yeah.
43:14
So, you graduated with a degree in forestry?
43:17
Yes.
43:17
With a minor in something else or just
43:19
-- ? No, just forestry.
43:20
And so.
43:21
I guess silviculture and ecology.
43:23
Actually, I have a degree in silviculture and ecology.
43:25
You came out and went to work for the Forest Service, or private industry?
43:30
For the Forest Service.
43:31
I went in and I got on what was called a coop-ed program, where I worked
43:35
during the summers and then I took another term off and worked on the
43:39
Green Mountain [NF] . When I graduated, they had an option to pick me up, if
43:44
they wanted, and I had the option to join the Forest Service, which I did.
43:48
So, I worked on different districts, working seasonally on the Rochester
43:54
Ranger District and then the Manchester Ranger District, where I worked
43:58
for two-and-a-half or three years.
44:01
What was your job description, and what did you do?
44:04
Well, I was initially a forest—what do you call it, a “forester in
44:11
training.” So, I did everything.
44:13
But the interesting thing for me, I always had to mark timber.
44:16
That was the first thing I always had to do, because I had to sort of prove myself.
44:20
I really did feel that at some point I decided that this was a bit of a
44:25
gender thing, that coming in, they'd go, "Oh well, but can she mark timber?"
44:31
That's a very physical kind of thing.
44:33
So, I marked timber over and over and over.
44:35
I marked a lot of timber.
44:37
So yes, I have marked trees that are to be cut.
44:39
I've done it in clear-cuts, shelterwoods, and thinnings.
44:43
I've done all kinds of that work.
44:45
Sounds like you really were destined to challenge gender stereotypes.
44:50
I
44:52
mean, going back to your family and your grandmother saying about
44:55
the right to vote in 1920, and
44:57
-- Right.
44:58
So when I went to Vermont, that was where I started to feel like there
45:04
was something going on with me being a woman, where I actually really
45:07
didn't feel that way up to that point.
45:09
But when I got on a rig with a forest technician after my second day on the
45:14
job, and he drove me to the end of a dirt road, parked the car and looked at
45:18
me, and said, "You should not be here. You are taking jobs away from men who
45:23
have to support wives and children." He looked at me, and then, he turned
45:31
around and went back to the district.
45:32
He was supposed to be giving me a tour of the district.
45:35
That was my tour.
45:36
At that point, I was like, that was the sobering moment where I went, huh!
45:43
That's a very strong wakeup call.
45:46
I mean, kind of scary, a little bit.
45:49
Yeah.
45:51
Were you angry?
45:53
Shocked, I mean.
45:54
That was actually at a point in my life where I found it to be challenging.
45:59
And I was shocked.
46:03
I was not frightened.
46:04
You know, I have a very strong sense of myself, in some regards.
46:10
I just kind of laughed.
46:14
Actually, I'm sure I laughed when he said that.
46:18
It probably was a nervous laugh.
46:19
But I also remember thinking it was idiotic that he said that.
46:23
I thought it was really a ridiculous thing to say.
46:26
But it shows, I think, somebody that was raised with a very immature
46:31
understanding of gender roles, and the evolution of men and women that was
46:37
just completely unprepared for that.
46:39
Right.
46:42
So.
46:42
From my standpoint, my grandmother was widowed and had to raise her boys.
46:48
She was kicked out of her house because she was a woman, not expected
46:52
to be able to pay her mortgage.
46:54
I grew up on stories like this.
46:57
So, I knew that things could be very tough for women.
47:00
I just thought that that was over and done with.
47:05
On the other hand, they kind of prepared me.
47:08
And I know that I would not be where am I here without my grandmothers
47:14
saying what they had said to me, how they were very influential in my life.
47:19
So, you didn't know it, but they were preparing you for that moment.
47:24
So, you come back now, at that time, the whole – [society was changing]
47:30
But this isn't about the Northwest Forest Plan, but I supposed we can get there.
47:36
Now, do you remember going back, this is a different culture and time, the methods
47:42
and complaints weren't like you could today, an HR person or somebody you go to.
47:47
You just basically internalized that, you didn't go complain to a district ranger.
47:50
Exactly, exactly.
47:51
You just kind of said, okay, that's interesting, and internalized it as
47:55
part of your learning experience?
47:56
Exactly.
47:57
That was just one of a variety of things that happened which
48:01
I completely internalized.
48:07
It was a mixed bag.
48:08
There were some things that happened in that area.
48:13
Those seasonal jobs weren't too bad because I came and I went,
48:16
but there was one, this technician and another technician resented
48:21
me because I was a college girl.
48:24
They resented me because I was a girl.
48:27
When
48:31
I was working with them a little later, they would do things,
48:36
would haze me continually.
48:39
They would make me carry the chainsaw.
48:41
They would make me carry all the equipment.
48:43
They would do things, like say, "Go get the car," and
48:46
throw the keys into the woods.
48:51
Stuff you could never do today.
48:52
No, no.
48:55
So initially, they would tell me that women, I mean, it was
48:58
a topic of conversation that women can't do what men can.
49:02
They can't play baseball, they can't do this.
49:04
I mean, everything, just everything.
49:06
It was a continual conversation.
49:08
About, yeah.
49:11
It was total harassment.
49:13
Now, I didn't even know that term.
49:14
And let me tell you about that because, so I—
49:17
You didn't even know that was harassment?
49:17
I didn't know, it wasn't there [terminology/culture
49:17
shift still in future]
49:17
. Because it wasn't in the cultural lexicon at that time.
49:17
And so,
49:25
let me tell you what happened then related to this.
49:27
So, I worked the seasonal job and just put up with these guys.
49:33
This is in Vermont?
49:33
This is in Vermont.
49:34
I went back, got my degree, then got a job with another district.
49:38
The district ranger there, I just didn't feel warm and fuzzy about him.
49:45
But I worked with some very nice technicians there, a couple
49:49
of guys that were wonderful.
49:51
Then there was a crew that was
49:56
very, very….
49:58
[cloistered] ; they’d never been out of the valley.
50:01
People literally did not leave their valleys in Vermont.
50:06
I worked with them really well,
50:12
marked a lot of timber with them.
50:13
That's mostly what I did.
50:15
But I went on to do other things, and another woman came in.
50:20
She
50:24
was unable to work with that group.
50:33
It was so unfair what they did to her.
50:35
She was Jewish.
50:38
She was female and Jewish.
50:41
So, she got the double-hammer.
50:42
Right?
50:43
And so, they actually--
50:45
That's too bad.
50:46
She had baked them cookies.
50:48
She was trying so hard.
50:49
I'm
50:52
really good at ignoring bad behavior.
50:55
But she couldn't, and she extended herself by baking cookies.
51:01
They took her box of cookies and threw them in the trash.
51:03
They
51:06
had drawn swastikas all over
51:10
the box.
51:10
I was appalled, and went to my first civil rights meeting a couple days later
51:20
at the forest supervisor’s office.
51:22
I brought this incident up.
51:24
That was a mistake.
51:25
Ever heard of the term “retaliation?” Next thing I knew, I
51:35
literally had my back against the wall.
51:37
While not pushed physically, the
51:42
forest supervisor walked me into a wall.
51:43
His face was one foot from my face, asking for details.
51:47
I thought the meeting was in confidence and I was seeking advice.
51:51
I was very naïve.
51:52
I asked the forest supervisor to not contact the district ranger
51:59
until I could tell him myself.
52:01
That afternoon, I went to the district office and talked to the ranger.
52:02
His response was to throw
52:06
everything on his desk at me.
52:10
That was the only time I cried in my professional life.
52:17
I sat down, tears came down from my eyes, and I walked out of the room.
52:24
By the next day, I no longer reported to him.
52:27
There were lots of conversations behind closed doors.
52:29
The woman left within the
52:37
month.
52:37
I stayed.
52:37
Maybe I thought, "By God, I want my three years." If you have three years
52:43
of experience as a permanent employee, you have competitive status for rehires.
52:49
In terms of rehiring in another job position.
52:51
So, you toughed it out.
52:52
Right.
52:53
I just toughed it out.
52:56
For how much longer?
52:58
Probably a year-and-a-half or so.
53:01
It was a long time, a long haul.
53:03
But you know, there were a couple of technicians who treated me very well.
53:10
One in particular, and he kind of knew what was going on.
53:13
He would invite me to his family’s home, and I would have holiday meals with them.
53:19
He made it bearable.
53:20
There were a couple other people that made it bearable.
53:22
So, I just stuck it out.
53:23
Then I decided, "I don't know if I'm going to stay with the Forest Service. I think
53:26
I'm going to do something different." So, I quit and went to do a master's
53:33
degree in journalism and communications.
53:38
I did have in the back of my mind that I might be able to combine that
53:41
with forestry, because I didn't think the Forest Service had very good
53:43
communicators, and they needed help.
53:45
I also truly sensed that that was a gender-okay thing for me to do.
53:49
So, you asked that about nursing?
53:51
Well, even though it was not as okay for women to be in journalism as early as it
53:59
was in these other professions [teaching, nursing, etc.] , but still, there were
54:01
a lot of famous women journalists.
54:03
Exactly.
54:03
In the early 20th and late 19th centuries.
54:06
I mean, you could look at, Ida Tarbell, the famous “muckraker - yellow
54:09
journalist.” She was one of the ones you'd hear in history class [early 20th century]
54:13
. Right.
54:14
Yeah, and there's Barbara Walters out there.
54:16
I was watching Barbara Walters.
54:17
Baba-Wawa.
54:17
[Laughs] [Saturday Night Live spoof by Gilda Radner]
54:17
Baba-Wawa.
54:17
And so,
54:22
I went back to school, journalism school.
54:26
At?
54:26
University of Minnesota.
54:27
The same or main campus?
54:30
The main campus [Minneapolis]
54:31
. Okay.
54:31
That was great.
54:32
I couldn't get in right away.
54:33
So, I'm going to come back to harassment.
54:35
I
54:39
actually thought I could start and
54:43
take undergraduate journalism courses at undergraduate cost.
54:48
But, I took a year off and took literature classes,
54:56
falling into this
54:59
group of women’s literature professors who were teaching women's literature.
55:06
This was a whole introduction into feminism for me.
55:09
And I took a law class from a visiting professor from Yale who was,
55:19
she was, Catherine—it will come to me, but she actually coined the
55:26
phrase "harassment." She was a law clerk, and one of the first sexual
55:33
harassment cases she was involved with actually went to the Supreme Court.
55:38
So, I actually learned about sexual harassment from the woman who actually
55:43
helped coin that phrase, legally.
55:45
And this was about ten years before Anita Hill.
55:46
Yes, this was--
55:48
About ten years before that.
55:49
This was well before Anita Hill [– Clarence Thomas Supreme
55:50
Court Justice confirmation hearings, at which she was star witness]
55:50
. So, but I mean, but Anita Hill was--
55:53
Catherine MacKinnon.
55:53
Catherine MacKinnon from Yale.
55:54
Right, I know her name.
55:56
She taught this course with Andrea Dworkin, a radical
56:00
feminist, from New York City.
56:02
So, I went from the woods and this odd, strange situation, to this.
56:08
By the way, I also waitressed at night [in Vt.] , just to get
56:13
around other women and get away from that whole thing.
56:16
That was actually an out for me, as I had another job and moonlighted.
56:20
I had a lot of energy.
56:23
Those guys back East are lucky you didn't take all these classes before-hand,
56:29
or you would have responded stronger.
56:31
One nice thing that happened was that I got a call from an HR person in Milwaukee,
56:39
and she interviewed me after the fact.
56:42
I believe there was a sense something had happened, that
56:48
they wanted to know why I left.
56:52
That was interesting to me, and I appreciated that.
56:56
I then started working for the North Central Forest Experiment
56:59
Station, very wonderful people.
57:02
I had a good experience there.
57:05
I didn't want to work for the
57:08
Forest Service.
57:09
I always like to have a Plan B; my Plan B. I put in an application at
57:12
the North Central Experiment Station, which was located in St. Paul.
57:16
Then I went to work for the University of Minnesota with this soils professor.
57:21
I did that while I was taking these literature classes.
57:25
I was actually started out in “law communications,” then switched to
57:31
“science communications,” because I really enjoyed working at North Central, and
57:39
yeah, it was actually kind of a healing thing.
57:41
I took Toastmasters also.
57:43
So, this [in New England] was a traumatic experience for you, wasn't it?
57:46
Oh, it was totally traumatic.
57:49
You're very good at playing down things, and like you said,
57:52
letting it roll off your back.
57:54
But just by you telling me your resume, I said to myself,
57:57
"This was not a small thing."
57:58
This was incredible.
58:01
It took me at least two years after I left that district to start to get
58:10
my feet under me.
58:13
It was very difficult, as a matter-of-fact, then I forgot it.
58:17
When we started having conversations in our agency related to this,
58:23
I can't really engage in those without feeling really emotional.
58:27
I actually wasn't feeling emotional for decades.
58:30
It just comes back.
58:32
I guess you would call that
58:36
a post-traumatic-stress kind of thing.
58:39
Yeah.
58:41
In some regards,
58:44
I
58:47
can tell.
58:49
But I went a couple decades just ignoring all this.
58:53
When I was working with the Northwest Forest Plan, this experience seemed
59:00
way behind, you know, something that happened in the past, and I
59:06
just took it in stride by then.
59:07
I was able to do that,
59:12
as after a couple years I was able to get on with what I wanted to do.
59:17
I'm going to just say, by God, I wasn't going to let anybody keep
59:21
me from doing what I wanted to do.
59:23
If I wanted to work in the woods, I had every right to work in the woods.
59:27
If I wanted to pursue a forestry degree, that's what I was going to do.
59:35
When I thought, okay, this was a horrible experience, I felt so bad for that woman,
59:43
still feel bad about that situation.
59:46
And there were
59:50
a few people that got pretty bad, and I was being sexually harassed, for sure.
1:00:01
But at some point, I was able to
1:00:05
get healed, work through that, and that really helped me to take those
1:00:08
courses, and take a step forward.
1:00:09
I read a lot of women's literature.
1:00:11
I took an intensive 16-credit women's literature class, read
1:00:15
everything from Kate Chopin to Simone de Beauvoir, to Virginia Woolf.
1:00:26
As I said, I actually studied with Andrea Dworkin.
1:00:31
So, that was really illuminating, hugely illuminating, for the rest of my career.
1:00:38
During my master's program, I had extensive background in gender
1:00:43
theory and women's history.
1:00:45
So you know [subject and issues] , yeah.
1:00:46
I know all of these people, remember Dworkin.
1:00:47
So, I'm not going to go on about that.
1:00:54
I would say that you had a strong sense of yourself, but you were still
1:00:57
kind of a young woman, naïve, and
1:01:03
this little foray, that is
1:01:06
not the word, the little break you took.
1:01:09
You're regrouping.
1:01:10
Right, I regrouped.
1:01:11
Your regrouping era, and what you did with that, gave you a lot of emotional
1:01:18
and intellectual vim and vigor.
1:01:21
How is that?
1:01:22
Yeah, that's the way, I think that's true.
1:01:26
Yeah, it attached with an already strong sense of healthy gender identity and
1:01:32
your place in the world, with something that would take you and serve you well
1:01:36
as you developed professionally later on.
1:01:38
Yeah.
1:01:39
So, it was probably a good thing.
1:01:41
Oh yeah, you know, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
1:01:46
Okay, we're back on.
1:01:48
And you're refinding
1:01:51
your way in your career.
1:01:52
Yeah.
1:01:53
Tell me where you go from after your journalism.
1:01:55
You start your communications work back in the Northern Lakes.
1:01:58
How does that end up taking you to the Northwest?
1:02:03
Well,
1:02:08
as I said, I really enjoyed my work.
1:02:12
I was working with growth yield modeling and tech transfer, at
1:02:17
that time, for the North Central Forest and Experimental Station.
1:02:25
I actually did want to get on permanently, but there was a hiring freeze.
1:02:30
And I decided that would be a good time to join the Peace Corps.
1:02:35
So, I actually resigned again from the Forest Service, and I went into the
1:02:40
Peace Corps, where I met my husband.
1:02:46
You met him in Ecuador.
1:02:47
Correct?
1:02:47
And I met him in Ecuador.
1:02:47
Right.
1:02:48
He's originally from the Pacific Northwest.
1:02:50
And so, he left before I did to go get a Master's of Forestry at the
1:02:58
University of Washington in Seattle.
1:03:01
So, that's how I landed in the Pacific Northwest.
1:03:05
I got
1:03:08
to Seattle and had thought about maybe being a social scientist.
1:03:13
I had actually studied with a rural sociologist, who also
1:03:16
was a media researcher out of the University of Minnesota.
1:03:23
And I thought
1:03:28
that sociology was really interesting.
1:03:32
So, the first person I called was Roger Clark, the social
1:03:35
scientist at the research station.
1:03:37
[Pacific Northwest Research Station, or PNW]
1:03:38
. The person who became the team leader in the FEMAT, correct?
1:03:42
Right.
1:03:42
Yes.
1:03:43
So, I called Roger and said, "Hey, I'm looking for a job," and told him
1:03:51
a little bit about my background.
1:03:52
He said, "Well, you'd make a good editor, I bet." He introduced me to
1:03:59
Martha Brooks, Martha and I talked, and she wanted me to come down to Portland.
1:04:08
Initially, I just wanted to be in Seattle.
1:04:12
I really was looking around for other jobs.
1:04:14
I went back to North Central,
1:04:19
just to visit folks there and get some recommendations, and eventually,
1:04:25
I got on with the research station.
1:04:27
I did come to Portland about a year later, starting as an editor working with Martha,
1:04:33
and doing editing and special assignments for scientists, including Roger.
1:04:39
The editing was okay, but I was more interested in tech transfer, the kind of
1:04:42
work I had been doing at North Central.
1:04:46
He [Roger] was instrumental in moving me into that arena,
1:04:54
which was shortly after I came to the station in '87.
1:04:59
So,
1:05:02
by 1993, I found myself working on the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:05:08
Now, you were in Ecuador in the early '80s?
1:05:12
Yeah, mid-'80s, or early '80s.
1:05:15
Then you went to Seattle, and eventually came back here.
1:05:21
So,
1:05:25
let's see, continue on that track you were talking about being an editor and
1:05:29
coming into the PNW Station in Portland?
1:05:31
One of the very first papers I edited,
1:05:37
I edited it pretty heavily.
1:05:38
Then
1:05:41
I talked to the fellow who wrote it, actually, it was
1:05:46
a paper with many authors.
1:05:49
It just lacked a single voice.
1:05:51
That's what I was struggling with.
1:05:55
I sent the paper to the author [primary] , then he called me.
1:05:59
That was Jack Ward Thomas.
1:06:02
One of the first papers I edited was Jack Ward Thomas' paper.
1:06:05
Through that job of editing, I got to know pretty much every
1:06:09
scientist in the station.
1:06:13
Then, I was a tech transfer specialist.
1:06:15
First thing I did was I went to every scientist I could in a given
1:06:20
amount of time, and interviewed them about why do they do what they do.
1:06:24
What are the motivations around their work in assuring people adopt new concepts
1:06:33
and new practices, new technologies, and new scientific information.
1:06:38
That was my real interest.
1:06:40
I spoke about the sociologists I worked with, who introduced me to Everett
1:06:46
Rogers' work on diffusion and innovations.
1:06:48
I was fascinated by that.
1:06:50
And I was also fascinated by that when I was in Ecuador, because
1:06:52
that's a lot of what I was doing.
1:06:54
I was working with agro-forestry practices, and working with people
1:07:00
in the community who valued trees, and then just looking at how could
1:07:04
we get more trees on the land.
1:07:07
I was working with alder, which is a nitrogen fixer.
1:07:12
And so, that was a whole system.
1:07:14
So, anyway, that was kind of the arena.
1:07:17
When FEMAT came along, wow!
1:07:22
Here we are, bringing the latest science together and looking at
1:07:28
its application on the ground.
1:07:30
That is just where I am at.
1:07:33
That is why I stayed with the station all this time.
1:07:38
After moving around all over the place, when I got here and realized the kind of
1:07:46
science that was being done, and right away I recognized that this place was just
1:07:52
repeating the history that my grandparents had talked about in terms of clear-cutting
1:07:56
and cutting old-growth forests.
1:07:58
Well, this was just right.
1:08:01
I just felt like I was just here, getting to witness this whole thing unfolding.
1:08:10
It was like you'd finally found a home, even though you didn't
1:08:13
know where it would lead yet?
1:08:14
Right.
1:08:15
And at that point, I still didn't think I was sure.
1:08:19
You know, I resigned from this agency twice.
1:08:24
I had quite an attitude about it; I might take it or leave it.
1:08:29
But,
1:08:34
I was completely fascinated.
1:08:39
Just in intellectual terms, I found it extremely fascinating.
1:08:44
I feel like I have kind of bore witness, right?
1:08:48
I think it's very true, part of what I learned in my career, that
1:08:52
probably my point in time being a woman, I can probably do the most
1:08:58
good just having a presence, making sure there's a woman in the room.
1:09:03
I realize if I would say something, often when I would speak, if I started
1:09:10
speaking about natural resources, the science, I would be quickly cut off.
1:09:16
But what I realized is I just needed for me, for who I am, I just wanted to
1:09:21
be in the room and bear witness, and have a presence and connect with any
1:09:27
other women that happened to be around.
1:09:30
So, I think that because I took a lot of the feminism work, read a lot of
1:09:36
history, and read a lot of literature,
1:09:43
I took that in, in a particular way that gave me a sense of time and place.
1:09:50
And I sure had an understanding about the agency at, you know, I'm going to
1:09:55
say this very sarcastically, at “its finest,” in terms of gender. I had,
1:10:00
you know, I had gone down “the hole.”
1:10:02
You'd seen, actually, the nastiest underbelly.
1:10:05
The nastiest underbelly, so I was very aware of
1:10:12
that, but the thing about the
1:10:17
Research and Development branch of the Forest Service, is it's
1:10:20
a little more sophisticated.
1:10:21
I'm not saying it isn't biased, gender-biased, but it's a little
1:10:24
more sophisticated about it.
1:10:25
And of course, as the decades move long, society is becoming more progressive.
1:10:33
Yeah.
1:10:34
And the Northwest is generally more progressive, although
1:10:37
not always in all places.
1:10:39
Yeah, and I have to say, I don't know what progress is any more, for some reason.
1:10:46
I feel I don't know.
1:10:48
I think we sometimes think we know what progress is, but
1:10:51
if I reflect, I don't know
1:10:54
exactly what progress is.
1:10:55
I don't know what
1:11:01
that means.
1:11:03
I guess the older you get, the
1:11:06
less you understand.
1:11:10
I remember one of the great moments of humility was when I was in the
1:11:14
middle of my doctoral program.
1:11:17
A lot of doctoral students, because you're reading all the
1:11:21
time, think they know everything.
1:11:23
One day, I remember stepping outside the building and looking around
1:11:26
at all the buildings on campus, and I thought, you know what?
1:11:30
On every floor of every one of these buildings, there are a bunch of
1:11:34
people that know a lot more than me.
1:11:37
I just remember, that was like a humbling moment, where I just go, okay,
1:11:41
yeah, I'm learning a lot of stuff, and I'm kind of smart, but chill.
1:11:46
[Laughs]
1:11:46
Yeah.
1:11:48
Absolutely.
1:11:50
You know, so I don't know, yeah.
1:11:55
But those are good moments to have, because you do meet people
1:11:58
who never have those moments.
1:11:59
[Laughs]
1:11:59
Yeah.
1:11:59
And they definitely think they know more than they actually
1:12:04
know, and they let you know it.
1:12:06
Right, right, right.
1:12:07
Yeah.
1:12:08
What was the first time you actually came to the Northwest?
1:12:12
You told me you were in Montana, and you did come to—I'm talking
1:12:15
about the western forests.
1:12:18
When did you actually come to the “wet” forests?
1:12:20
I know you were in Washington on the Colville NF [Western gradient-Rocky Mtns.]
1:12:23
I just have to say that on the Colville, I sat for four hours and tried to
1:12:29
hitchhike my way out of Newport [NE Washington] to get to the West Coast,
1:12:32
because I really wanted to see these forests, but nobody picked me up.
1:12:38
[Laughs] So, it took me a while.
1:12:40
Eventually--
1:12:42
You did actually come out in the '70s, briefly?
1:12:44
No, I was in Colville.
1:12:46
I was at the Newport Ranger District on the road.
1:12:48
But you never made it out here, is what I'm saying.
1:12:50
Never got out here.
1:12:51
Okay.
1:12:51
So, when was the first time you saw the big wet forests?
1:12:54
Well, my first real experience was because my father-in-law is a forester.
1:13:01
I actually went out doing some inventory work with him and my husband,
1:13:06
and I did some field work with him.
1:13:10
And, wow, because that's I think how you really experience a forest, by
1:13:17
just getting out in it and not being on a trail even, just taking a compass
1:13:22
line and going for it, you know.
1:13:25
Yeah.
1:13:25
This is up near Seattle?
1:13:25
No, this was here in Oregon.
1:13:26
Okay.
1:13:27
This was in Oregon.
1:13:28
I can't even recall exactly where it was, but it was quite interesting.
1:13:35
I couldn't believe there were so few species of conifer.
1:13:39
I was thinking, there's got to be more.
1:13:41
That was one thing, but the other was just the slopes.
1:13:44
And I did notice the duff, this deep duff, and then [stinging]
1:13:49
nettles, you know, going up the hill there were nettles about.
1:13:54
There is a resemblance in these forests to what I was working in
1:13:58
the Colville, because there were drainages with very similar species.
1:14:02
I mean, there was Douglas-fir and hemlock, and cedar, there, as well.
1:14:10
But the climate regime was different there.
1:14:12
Very different.
1:14:13
You wouldn't get quite the density and the size of trees, either.
1:14:17
No, not the big, big trees.
1:14:18
Right.
1:14:20
And the big trees were not necessarily very old, you know, relatively.
1:14:23
I mean, a big tree here, a 200-year-old tree in northern Minnesota is the
1:14:30
same size of a 50-year-old tree in
1:14:34
Oregon.
1:14:35
Exactly.
1:14:36
So.
1:14:37
So, you were impressed?
1:14:38
I was totally impressed.
1:14:40
Oh, yeah.
1:14:44
What do you remember about the cultural and political context in the '80s and
1:14:50
leading into the early '90s, as you really hit your stride in this long
1:14:56
phase you've been in for quite some time.
1:14:58
What do you remember about the “Forest Wars,” and just the noise that was going
1:15:03
on about big trees and the movement, and the owl was starting to be discussed?
1:15:07
What do you remember about that, either out there in
1:15:11
society, or inside the agency?
1:15:11
Outside, I felt we were
1:15:17
on quite a continuum.
1:15:22
What I had kind of heard in the external world while I was in the Colville, which
1:15:30
was 1975, my sense was, it was just continuing.
1:15:35
And I really realize it means a lot more out here because these
1:15:39
trees are a lot more valuable.
1:15:40
My impression was, there's a lot more money in these forests.
1:15:44
I was in Vermont, but there wasn't a lot of money in those forests [national
1:15:48
forests] . I mean, we cut, and the money factor was there for sure, but we would
1:15:55
be having what, I guess you could call a gyppo logger from Canada, coming down
1:15:59
with his horse and harness, cutting up spruce and putting them in piles, and
1:16:05
we thought that was a really good sale.
1:16:06
Of
1:16:09
course, it was really important to that logger and it was important to that
1:16:13
local community, but you get out here and I could see, ah, industrial forestry.
1:16:19
On a big scale.
1:16:21
On a big scale.
1:16:21
I had a strong sense that the same players that were here now, were the
1:16:26
same players that were in Wisconsin and Minnesota in my history.
1:16:32
So, I did have the sense that, okay, things have just kind
1:16:36
of moved from there to here,
1:16:42
in terms of cutting big trees.
1:16:44
And there was a lot of money to be made.
1:16:47
I had that sense.
1:16:49
And they were rolling off [the forests] . I mean, my jaw dropped when I saw how
1:16:55
many log trucks, the big logs, were just continuously rolling down the highway.
1:17:00
I was in Seattle when they were cutting those clear-cuts
1:17:06
right along Snoqualmie Pass.
1:17:07
I remember thinking, "This is stupid. I mean, if I were a forester
1:17:12
working for one of these agencies, I would not put clear-cuts in that
1:17:17
kind of visual pathway." I had actually taken landscape courses.
1:17:22
I had worked with landscape
1:17:26
people on the Green Mountain [NF] . And so, I had a real sensibility
1:17:30
about if you're going to cut, you need to consider people's
1:17:34
perceptions about what you're doing.
1:17:37
And you need to consider beauty, the aesthetics of landscapes.
1:17:43
That's something that I really had, a sense of aesthetics.
1:17:47
Vermont was one place where there are a lot of
1:17:53
people looking at what's going on in those mountains.
1:17:56
So,
1:17:59
I think there's a much more community-based sense than there
1:18:03
seemed to be here when I arrived.
1:18:04
Also, you have the fact that Vermont and New Hampshire know that they are the
1:18:10
“postcard” for fall colors in America.
1:18:13
Right, exactly.
1:18:13
For example, whether you're from Boston or New York or from the West, people
1:18:18
go back there to see the fall colors and these classic New England towns,
1:18:23
and they don't want to see clear-cuts.
1:18:26
Clear-cuts.
1:18:27
Yeah, so we paid a lot of attention to how we laid out, and this was in the '70s.
1:18:33
You're going back to when you're in New England.
1:18:34
Yeah, in Vermont we paid a lot of attention.
1:18:38
When I saw what was going on the industrial lands; the Forest Service
1:18:43
had already limited their size of the clear-cuts by the time I got here.
1:18:48
When on the Colville, I was amazed at the 200-acre clear-cuts.
1:18:52
When you set those on fire in a prescribed burn that was pretty amazing.
1:18:56
So,
1:18:58
I was a little shocked to see the large clear-cuts being put in, in the view-sheds
1:19:05
that were left, and the number of trucks.
1:19:07
It was just like, well, they're mining it.
1:19:10
That was my sense.
1:19:11
This is a mining operation.
1:19:13
They're going to get to the end of this fast.
1:19:16
One thing I reference when I'm talking about why environmentalists today have
1:19:23
such a "take no prisoners" attitude, even though I think their political strategies
1:19:28
and attitudes can really come off bad, I think they're reacting against the sins of
1:19:35
the forefathers in the logging industry, where they didn't see anything wrong, and
1:19:39
they were just rolling ahead like this.
1:19:41
They're reacting viscerally, to something they see, and lack of a conscience.
1:19:48
Right.
1:19:51
I'm going to back up.
1:19:52
I'm going to tell you about some other experiences I've had.
1:19:54
No, that's fine.
1:19:55
This is what we're doing here.
1:19:56
And so, related to this.
1:20:00
The other thing I did when I was growing up,
1:20:07
was I worked on a ranch in eastern Montana.
1:20:10
Oh, okay.
1:20:11
For summers.
1:20:13
By Havre?
1:20:15
Sand Springs and Jordan.
1:20:16
Okay.
1:20:18
South of Havre.
1:20:18
Okay.
1:20:21
I got to know a ranching family really well.
1:20:24
And these folks,
1:20:28
they did things that I just would never do.
1:20:32
Right?
1:20:33
They did things,
1:20:38
like killing wildlife, that I felt was so wrong.
1:20:44
I also realized they didn't see it that way.
1:20:48
They just did not.
1:20:49
They had a whole different sensibility.
1:20:52
So, when I came here,
1:20:57
and I also know my own grandfather and great-grandfather were loggers, and
1:21:05
so I have to say, I also was quite uncomfortable with the notion that
1:21:13
it's “this side” against “that side.”
1:21:15
Right.
1:21:16
For me, it was about
1:21:21
“we're in this together.” I thought so at any rate, this sort of dichotomy of
1:21:33
perceptions of the natural world, and our interactions with them. That's a
1:21:39
human constraint, that’s a dichotomy, that's only as real as we make it.
1:21:46
It doesn't say
1:21:49
that one is
1:21:53
right and one is wrong, and why I think that’s why it is important to think
1:21:56
for a while there was so much noise.
1:22:01
I would tell no one that I was working for the Forest Service,
1:22:06
and if I told my neighbors who I worked for, we immediately got in
1:22:10
an owl debate, and they immediately pegged me in a certain category
1:22:14
as having a certain point-of-view.
1:22:19
But you know what?
1:22:19
If I was with one group, it would be one way, if it was another group,
1:22:23
it would be a different category.
1:22:25
And it was very interesting.
1:22:27
So, if you had a neighbor with environmental leanings,
1:22:31
you were the bad guy.
1:22:32
If you had neighbors or my father-in-law, who was pro-timber
1:22:38
industry, you were the bad guy.
1:22:40
So, there was no winning in terms of this kind of thinking.
1:22:45
Right?
1:22:45
For instance, when I was in my doctoral program and studying all over the Colorado
1:22:50
Plateau during the debates over saving the canyon lands [greater region] and all that
1:22:54
stuff, and I would say, "I am studying environmental history." Well, they would
1:22:59
only hear the word “environmental.”
1:23:00
Right.
1:23:01
I was an “environmentalist” in their eyes.
1:23:02
I would try to explain that scholars are not political activists.
1:23:05
I'd try to explain that, but I think I just sounded like another
1:23:11
urban-educated elitist to them.
1:23:13
Right, right.
1:23:14
And it kind of was a lost cause from that point.
1:23:17
But I tried.
1:23:19
Right.
1:23:20
But you know, it affected my life.
1:23:22
I pretty much stay away from those topics, and I really just didn't talk about
1:23:31
for the reasons you're talking about.
1:23:32
Because, I could not have an intelligent conversation, as they
1:23:36
all become visceral discussions.
1:23:38
Down on the [Colorado] Plateau, it was right after the Grand Staircase Escalante
1:23:41
National Monument controversy, when Clinton withdrew that huge area that
1:23:45
sent southern Utah into a big tizzy.
1:23:48
The BLM and Park Service people I worked with, and I knew them well,
1:23:55
as soon as they left work, they would take off their work clothes, because
1:24:01
they were afraid of getting hurt.
1:24:03
They
1:24:06
also did not
1:24:09
like driving company vehicles around.
1:24:12
Right.
1:24:12
Well, no, I wouldn't drive a government rig.
1:24:14
Yeah.
1:24:15
And you have to remember something else.
1:24:17
This was during the Edward Abbey era when “monkey-wrenching” [environmental
1:24:22
sabotage against equipment, trees, etc.] was culturally inculcated through a
1:24:25
book that was literally placed on the Colorado Plateau, The Monkey Wrench Gang.
1:24:29
Yeah.
1:24:30
So, there were people with very strong opinions.
1:24:34
There was minor violence, but nothing like you might think,
1:24:38
a real horrible situation.
1:24:39
Yeah.
1:24:41
Well, I don't know.
1:24:44
So, anyway, going back to cultural context, and you're seeing this go on.
1:24:48
You're in your position,
1:24:52
you're editing and then you're moving into your technical support position, right?
1:24:56
Yeah, tech transfer trying to get our science applied and used.
1:24:59
And what do you remember the atmosphere and the dialogue in the agency?
1:25:03
In the agency.
1:25:05
About clear-cutting, the owl, Endangered Species Act, all the
1:25:10
elements that would come together and create what happened in the '90s?
1:25:15
Yeah, the agency was a microcosm of the rest of the outer world.
1:25:21
There were people whose careers were tied to the way things
1:25:28
were, in terms of operations.
1:25:34
The whole system and National Forest System was set up in a particular way.
1:25:47
There were some people who felt one way about the situation,
1:25:53
other people, another way.
1:25:56
There were younger people coming in, and I associated with those people,
1:26:03
who felt some responsibility for future generations and the course being taken,
1:26:07
and saying, let's think about this.
1:26:10
What do we really want from these lands?
1:26:12
Is it timber?
1:26:13
Maybe it's more?
1:26:15
We have this law,
1:26:18
the Endangered Species
1:26:22
Act, and the Forest Service itself
1:26:28
had a mandate for multiple-use and a lot of different policies
1:26:32
that came into play in the '70s.
1:26:36
By the
1:26:41
'80s, they were being adopted, and policies were implemented, and you had
1:26:45
regulatory agencies coming into play.
1:26:49
The world had gotten quite complicated, particularly here.
1:26:54
And so, the culture within the organization was kind
1:26:57
of broiling a little bit.
1:27:01
Was there a lot of frustration?
1:27:03
A lot of frustration.
1:27:05
A lot of frustration.
1:27:12
I think that in this, but again, there's quite a difference between the National
1:27:17
Forest System and Research and Development [USFS] . Very different cultures.
1:27:21
Very different things going on in terms of looking at this.
1:27:28
Now, the '80s would have been kind of the time when you'd call, it
1:27:33
would be “the rise of the -ologists" [short-hand for scientists in govt.
1:27:35
agencies]
1:27:35
. Yes.
1:27:36
Within the agency.
1:27:37
What I mean by that is there was a time when science, for the most part with
1:27:44
some exceptions, an Aldo Leopold here and there, and voices for other things.
1:27:49
But the science was generally in the service of the main mandate, which was
1:27:55
utilitarian forestry, for a long time.
1:27:57
Right.
1:27:58
And to take the rougher edges off, you know, hydrological
1:28:01
damage and things like that.
1:28:02
But this was still the accepted paradigm, and
1:28:08
that was being challenged in the '80s by society-at-large, but also
1:28:12
within the agency by the -ologists who were having more and more power.
1:28:17
Correct?
1:28:17
Yes, absolutely.
1:28:19
How would you characterize the dynamic between the research and the regular
1:28:23
folks that were used to getting their way?
1:28:26
How did that play out, and what do you remember about that?
1:28:28
And we're leading right up to the [NWFP] Forest Plan now.
1:28:36
You had biologists way back in the '70s.
1:28:41
We were starting to hire more biologists, soil scientists, hydrologists.
1:28:47
I was a forester, and it was fun.
1:28:50
It was fun to interact with those folks.
1:28:52
But I knew that was going on there; I supposed it was the same
1:28:57
out here because I didn't work for the National Forest System.
1:28:59
But there was a bit of tension between timber and other functions.
1:29:07
And I know how you moved ahead in the organization at that time; you had
1:29:15
much better chance of moving ahead if you were a forester than an -ologist.
1:29:21
That is to say, most of leadership were traditional people
1:29:25
making decisions about budget,
1:29:33
policies and various things within the agency, and they generally came from more
1:29:38
of a traditional function of timber as being the predominant use, noting that we
1:29:44
had these other uses, but particularly in this part of the country, it was timber.
1:29:48
It struck me when I came in and saw paved roads all over the place.
1:29:54
They were all gravel roads back the lake states.
1:29:56
And I went, “Money,” you know.
1:29:59
Well, it's timber receipts.
1:30:02
The timber and the timber receipts, not only benefitted the communities, they
1:30:08
benefitted the whole structure, the whole way money flowed through that structure.
1:30:18
That all was in place in a way that people benefitted from timber
1:30:24
being cut within the agency, not just external to the agency.
1:30:28
But in the '80s, the -ologists who were hired the decade before, but they
1:30:33
actually started to gain some power.
1:30:34
Exactly.
1:30:35
And a voice.
1:30:36
And it wasn't just because dynamics in the agency, it was the legal dynamics
1:30:41
that were forcing the hand, where you had to ask, well, what does the science say?
1:30:47
Yeah, and it's interesting to me because the PNW Research Station has been
1:30:51
around for a long time, and all along the way our science has been informing
1:30:56
things, including clear-cutting.
1:30:58
It was our research that, for a while there, it looked like Douglas-fir really
1:31:04
was considered a pioneer kind of species, and it needed all the sun to grow.
1:31:13
It was kind of interesting.
1:31:14
But then in the '70s, the station did start to look at the effects of logging
1:31:19
in other ways, particularly on stream quality, water quality and fisheries.
1:31:24
Already in the '70s, the results were coming out saying that the current
1:31:34
practices are having adverse effects.
1:31:37
We were also looking at herbicides.
1:31:40
So the use of herbicides is another huge issue.
1:31:46
It's still an issue.
1:31:51
A lot of these studies were peripheral to what I am doing
1:31:55
with the H.J. Andrews’ [exp.
1:31:57
for.] history papers, and integrated in with those, a lot of the studies
1:32:01
in the '60s, actually after the DDT scandal, but 2,4,5-T and other things,
1:32:08
and there's a bunch of common names and chemical names I can't remember right
1:32:13
now, but they were asking questions about things that today we say, "Well,
1:32:17
yeah," but back then, they didn't know.
1:32:20
They didn't know.
1:32:20
They just didn't know.
1:32:20
It was like, if we spray this stuff everywhere, how is that
1:32:24
going to affect forest workers who work there for months at a time?
1:32:27
Questions like that.
1:32:28
Right.
1:32:30
I know, it's mind-boggling.
1:32:31
And that's the whole thing.
1:32:32
I know in terms of judging the past, is people didn't know.
1:32:39
People really didn't know things we know today.
1:32:42
So, when we look at how we make decisions, that's because we're in a really
1:32:47
interesting time right now, because of the whole notion of truth, at the moment.
1:32:52
We're living in a very, interesting time, in terms of facts.
1:32:58
But in the science community, you know,
1:33:03
that's our bread-and-butter.
1:33:04
During that time, we had studies set up that were looking at a variety of things.
1:33:09
And then we just things happen, like Eric Forsman did his
1:33:12
master's degree on this little owl
1:33:17
[northern spotted owl] , and I know you've talked to Eric, but I'm not sure that
1:33:19
he knew quite what the ramifications of that study would be when he started it.
1:33:27
He was a phenomenal interview, almost four hours.
1:33:29
And he told me how he first got fascinated with birds when he was in
1:33:34
high school along the Willamette River.
1:33:36
He went to Sheldon High School, one of our rivals.
1:33:39
And it was interesting that many in his family were loggers.
1:33:43
Yeah, so there you go.
1:33:44
He just said, "I just like birds," and it led to the n orthern spotted owl.
1:33:50
And no, he had no idea.
1:33:52
He just loved studying birds and got into the science thing.
1:33:58
Society and the forces of nature, so to speak, took care of the rest.
1:34:03
Right.
1:34:04
I had a sense of that when I started looking.
1:34:07
I was like, wow, there's all these moving parts.
1:34:10
I
1:34:13
found it quite overwhelming.
1:34:15
I felt the Northwest to be overwhelming.
1:34:16
I was used to small trees, and politics not being so huge.
1:34:23
I was a bit overwhelmed.
1:34:25
I
1:34:28
would go to Carson, to the Wind River [Exp.
1:34:31
For] . I spent a lot of time at Wind River when I first
1:34:34
came for a variety of reasons.
1:34:38
There were signs
1:34:43
with a spotted owl and a slash through it, and "eat spotted owls" signs.
1:34:46
And they had yellow ribbons.
1:34:48
And there was really a sense of
1:34:52
so much animosity towards the agency in that town.
1:34:58
I was going there in part because I lived nearby and would recreate there.
1:35:02
I would never tell anybody who I worked for.
1:35:07
I found that really overwhelming, really sad.
1:35:12
I was saddened.
1:35:14
I felt sad about that because
1:35:20
I didn't think
1:35:31
all the conflict would end well.
1:35:35
I didn't know where it was all going to end.
1:35:37
It was a sense of how is this all going to end?
1:35:40
Then, when I actually found myself suddenly in the mix, I
1:35:50
went from being overwhelmed to being really fascinated with the moment,
1:35:54
"Okay, wow, how is this going to unfold?" Because I was worried.
1:35:58
You sit there and you worry and you're watching this, you're close enough to it,
1:36:06
but suddenly, there was an opportunity to actually be part of something.
1:36:12
And this would be the early 1990s, correct?
1:36:14
This was when the FEMAT was starting, when we started to put the science together.
1:36:21
And what do you remember about the things leading up to FEMAT?
1:36:26
Obviously, you knew Jack Ward Thomas.
1:36:27
You edited something for him early on.
1:36:30
He was the primary author of the ISC Report, for instance,
1:36:33
Right, right.
1:36:33
You had environmental impact studies on the owl in the '80s.
1:36:37
Right.
1:36:37
You had all these things coming together, scientifically and politically.
1:36:40
Right.
1:36:42
Let's take the early '90s, and you asked earlier, when are we
1:36:46
going to get to the Forest Plan?
1:36:47
Well, now we're there.
1:36:49
Jump into the middle of it from when you said, okay, now I'm involved.
1:36:55
How did that involvement start?
1:36:59
Well,
1:37:08
specifically, there were all those studies.
1:37:09
Are you talking about PACFISH and there were all these things happening?
1:37:15
Well, there were many different things.
1:37:15
I was just trying to keep track of them.
1:37:17
Right.
1:37:17
I mean, I was observing that and I was editing some things.
1:37:20
That's what I mean, you were in a perfect place to see kind of the flow
1:37:23
of stuff coming through, scientifically.
1:37:24
Right, I was very aware of everything that was happening.
1:37:28
I wasn't involved myself, but I knew what was going on.
1:37:34
But I do remember, actually, the very day that the administration made the call,
1:37:39
that our research station got the call.
1:37:41
Charlie Philpott got the call from the President.
1:37:46
They were going to have this meeting here in Portland.
1:37:48
From Bill Clinton?
1:37:49
It was not Clinton himself, but someone from the administration.
1:37:50
It was unusual for an administration to directly call a station director.
1:37:55
Soon, there was an intense amount of activity around assembling a
1:38:01
group of scientists and getting something out based on science.
1:38:10
There was a notion by the administration that you could put some science
1:38:14
together, and then, come up with some options and that we could
1:38:20
bring some peace to this region.
1:38:23
Because it really was, as I said, an overwhelming amount of conflict.
1:38:26
I mean, we were all overwhelmed.
1:38:28
It was just this, wow, how can things be so conflicted, how
1:38:32
can there be this much conflict?
1:38:34
Well, you'd had a year or two since the Dwyer decision, which
1:38:38
basically shut down almost all the logging on the federal land.
1:38:42
Right.
1:38:42
Not all, but a lot.
1:38:44
A lot.
1:38:46
And people were freaking out.
1:38:48
They were completely freaking out.
1:38:50
You know, the communities, you'd go into Carson [Washington]
1:38:53
, people weren't working.
1:38:54
They weren't getting pay checks, so, of course, they were upset.
1:38:57
And
1:39:00
I could say more on that.
1:39:02
That county never recovered.
1:39:04
That county has yet to recover from this.
1:39:08
They had a really good reason to be [upset] . They saw what was coming,
1:39:15
I guess in some regards, or they were afraid that it could go to a
1:39:19
point where they wouldn't have jobs.
1:39:23
So, you can see how people from traditional extractive industries, the
1:39:28
towns, these perspectives, traditional, not with the "urban perspective,"
1:39:35
would feel great resentment and anger?
1:39:37
Oh, absolutely.
1:39:38
Yeah.
1:39:39
Yes,
1:39:46
I could empathize with them very much.
1:39:48
I really did understand what the gravity of this situation was.
1:39:57
It became very politicized when President Clinton entered the picture, of course.
1:40:05
And also,
1:40:10
very, very interesting.
1:40:11
So, what do you remember about the time you mentioned just a minute ago, when
1:40:15
Clinton called for the Forest Summit?
1:40:17
Yeah.
1:40:18
And it was just a couple, three months after he got inaugurated, I believe.
1:40:23
Oh, it was just so quick.
1:40:24
Two months, I think.
1:40:25
It was two months.
1:40:26
It was April, correct?
1:40:27
It was April when the call came in.
1:40:29
I remember all of a sudden, I saw the station director [PNW] come out,
1:40:35
and he just looked kind of pale.
1:40:39
Like?
1:40:41
Yeah.
1:40:42
Like, hold on to your “you-know-what”?
1:40:45
I don't know that he said a lot, but I remember shortly after, finding
1:40:49
out why he appeared that way.
1:40:51
This was Charlie Philpott.
1:40:51
Right?
1:40:51
Yeah, why he appeared like that, and then, he had Roger Clark come
1:40:59
immediately down from Seattle.
1:41:03
It was Jim Sedell, and then, Jack [Ward Thomas] , who came over.
1:41:09
Now that was a big discussion, you know.
1:41:13
But anyway, they brought those players together, really, really quickly.
1:41:18
And there were discussions about doing things in a particular way.
1:41:22
But I have to say, the administration, said, well,
1:41:26
this is what we're looking for.
1:41:28
How long did you all have did you all have to prepare for the Summit, from
1:41:33
the phone call till the actual Summit?
1:41:35
The Summit.
1:41:36
There were a lot of people involved.
1:41:37
Tom Tuchman may have come in at that point, but also other people
1:41:45
from Washington, D.C. I didn't see much of that.
1:41:49
I just knew that they were assembling all these
1:41:55
people.
1:41:55
I remember little things, like we had to get a transcriber, as
1:42:00
it was all going to be recorded.
1:42:02
And there was a notion that what was about to happen had to be recorded and
1:42:04
preserved, so we knew what was going to be stated there was important, and it was
1:42:11
known, from this event, this Summit, there would be activity [intense] at the station
1:42:18
[PNW] . There was already a sense of that.
1:42:21
I wasn't privy to the conversations around that, I just knew that there was
1:42:25
something of large magnitude was going on.
1:42:27
So, the Summit happened.
1:42:30
Where were you?
1:42:31
Did you see it on TV?
1:42:32
Yeah, I watched it on TV.
1:42:35
What do you remember about the energy in the agency, but also the whole dynamic?
1:42:43
Well, the President, he just gets elected and he's out to Portland.
1:42:48
For one thing, I guess people see that this is such a high priority
1:42:55
that the President is making.
1:42:58
It's one of the things he's addressing in the first few months of his
1:43:02
administration, giving it a lot of gravity and, wow, like somebody's paying
1:43:06
attention to what's going out here!
1:43:09
I remember thinking that.
1:43:11
In retrospect, it makes you wonder how much Al Gore had to do with that.
1:43:14
[Based on reputation as environmental advocate.]
1:43:15
And Al Gore was there.
1:43:17
I believe he actually came to the Pink Tower.
1:43:23
So, he definitely was a presence.
1:43:26
And
1:43:29
I think there were people he associated with that would come by, some very
1:43:34
well-known biologists and world-class kind of biologists, would just
1:43:39
stop by and see what was happening.
1:43:41
Now you’re talking about at the Pink Tower?
1:43:43
Yeah.
1:43:43
Pink Tower.
1:43:44
So,
1:43:47
the Summit happens, you're given the charge, basically, 60 days.
1:43:56
Panic.
1:43:57
I can't even imagine.
1:43:59
It
1:44:03
ended up being a 90-day mission [30 days added], but
1:44:07
to people I interview, I jokingly call it a “90-day slumber party.”
1:44:09
Yeah.
1:44:09
Or however you want to characterize it.
1:44:11
No, it was.
1:44:14
[Very long hours, people sleeping on floor, under desks, etc.]
1:44:14
And so, you're given how long between the Summit and when the FEMAT/Pink
1:44:19
Tower session actually started?
1:44:21
Was it one month?
1:44:23
I don't even think it was a month, but maybe three weeks ? Let's see.
1:44:28
I could figure that out, because I was pregnant at the time.
1:44:34
My son was born,
1:44:37
July 22, 1993.
1:44:39
He's 24 tomorrow.
1:44:42
We finished up about a month before he was born.
1:44:46
So, we finished [FEMAT/Pink Tower] in mid-June.
1:44:51
You were busy.
1:44:53
Yeah.
1:44:54
Physiologically.
1:44:55
I was busy.
1:44:57
[Laughs]
1:44:58
That must have been an especially intense summer for you?
1:45:01
Yeah, that was a little crazy.
1:45:03
Now,
1:45:05
we're in your office, and we can see the Pink Tower.
1:45:08
Correct?
1:45:09
There it is.
1:45:10
Isn't that it right there?
1:45:11
[North/Northwest out Miner’s window]
1:45:15
Yeah, that's it.
1:45:15
Is it still the United Bank Building, or has it changed?
1:45:17
I think so, yeah.
1:45:17
I think the U.S. Bank is still there.
1:45:23
It's kind of interesting that you have this direct-line view from your office.
1:45:29
Right, and I always think, you know.
1:45:30
Where were you [PNW] at the time?
1:45:31
Where was your office at the time?
1:45:33
Well, even closer.
1:45:34
Oh, really?
1:45:35
But I didn't have a view of it because I was so close.
1:45:37
We were in the old Multnomah Hotel, which is on Third and Oak.
1:45:48
What was your role in that process, first of all?
1:45:53
Were you support staff?
1:45:54
I was.
1:45:54
Roger asked me
1:45:57
to help with writing the social science assessment.
1:46:06
Social scientists, I have to say, sometimes are notorious for not
1:46:13
necessarily writing so people can understand what they're saying.
1:46:17
I fully understand.
1:46:18
So, I think that's what he had hoped that I would help with.
1:46:23
Well, you mean, your journalism training and perspective is very helpful for
1:46:28
that, because that's a style that is more accessible to the non-specialist.
1:46:34
Right.
1:46:35
Were you actually involved in a lot of the sessions, or were you
1:46:39
mostly kind of out editing stuff and that kind of thing?
1:46:41
Well, the thing was, pen did not get set to paper for weeks.
1:46:47
And I was actually quite frustrated with that.
1:46:49
I wanted to get to work.
1:46:50
I spent a lot of time in those sessions.
1:46:52
I was like a little mouse in the corner.
1:46:55
We would have the evening sessions every night, and I would attend those.
1:47:02
I don't think anyone noticed I was there, particularly.
1:47:09
They would have the biological people quite separate from
1:47:12
the social science people.
1:47:15
I think that there were actually separate sessions, but then, I think Jack brought
1:47:20
everybody together in the evening, and they could be working quite late.
1:47:25
Now, because I was pregnant, I kept to eight hours a day.
1:47:31
You had limits, for sure.
1:47:32
I had limits.
1:47:33
So, I wasn't out there late into the evening, with just a few exceptions.
1:47:38
Once they started writing, I was there later more often.
1:47:42
And since you were pregnant, you don't have any good drinking stories.
1:47:45
No.
1:47:46
[Laughter] No, I didn't go to the bars.
1:47:48
The carousing, but I'm sure there was a lot.
1:47:50
I don't know.
1:47:53
I'm sure.
1:47:56
I don't even know about that.
1:47:58
People didn't generally talk about that in the interviews too much.
1:48:01
I don't know that there was a lot.
1:48:02
[People were very focused/fatigued]
1:48:02
I don't know if they had any energy
1:48:04
. I don't really remember any of that.
1:48:07
It's possible some folks did, but you know, it was very intense.
1:48:15
People in the room, these were all very serious people, and there was a sense this
1:48:22
was a pivotal moment in their careers.
1:48:27
Everybody felt that, and in hindsight, that was true.
1:48:35
Everybody didn't agree with things, and there were boisterous discussions,
1:48:40
as scientists always have, but particularly some at that time.
1:48:44
There were
1:48:46
discussions about methodologies and approaches, and then there were arguments.
1:48:51
There were
1:48:55
big egos in the room.
1:48:56
There were big egos.
1:48:57
And so, that was fascinating.
1:48:59
Science is a process of human concoction and human nature.
1:49:06
So, that all came out during that time, and more than you would
1:49:11
normally see, I think, because of the pressure on everybody.
1:49:15
And of course, it was obvious sixty days wasn't going to be quite enough.
1:49:19
Right.
1:49:19
Right.
1:49:20
They were given another thirty [To find option White House would accept]
1:49:23
. Yeah, yeah.
1:49:24
It's really incredible to think about the intensity and that big of a charge
1:49:30
in terms of what you were supposed to do in a short a period of time.
1:49:35
Yeah, and I have to say, Jack Ward Thomas, he was up to the task, but
1:49:43
Marty Raphael also played a big role.
1:49:45
He was kind of his assistant, more or less, kind of making things go.
1:49:53
So, between them and the other leads, and people thinking, let’s just roll
1:49:58
up our sleeves and let's get this done, and we're going to work hard.
1:50:01
And they did.
1:50:06
While there were reporters in the hallway, there were occasionally guards.
1:50:12
There was--
1:50:15
Did you have any protestors try to come in?
1:50:17
I don't remember that happening.
1:50:18
Or outside the building?
1:50:19
Well, no, not there.
1:50:21
I think there were things happening, as there had been for a long time.
1:50:26
I mean, demonstrations were just common.
1:50:30
I'd walk out of the building where I worked and there were
1:50:32
often demonstrations, and
1:50:37
when we were over in the Multnomah Building.
1:50:39
Now, the U.S. Bank building, it actually took people a while
1:50:43
to even know we were there.
1:50:46
We were on the—I think it was actually the 13th floor, but
1:50:50
I think it was maybe the 14th.
1:50:52
We called it the 14th floor or something.
1:50:54
Now, it was only science people.
1:50:57
Well, this was the thing, and this was the point.
1:50:59
There weren't managers.
1:51:01
I understand why they tried that, but I have a few doubts or questions about
1:51:07
the wisdom of that in the long-term.
1:51:09
Right.
1:51:09
Concerning that, what do you have to say?
1:51:13
I can remember a discussion with Charlie Philpott and Roger
1:51:18
Clark about the necessity of bringing managers into the room.
1:51:24
This
1:51:28
was something, as a social scientist, Roger thought was important.
1:51:33
He understood that, as social science on the diffusion of innovations show,
1:51:33
the best way to have things applied well is to have users, in this case the
1:51:34
managers, involved in the process of developing new concepts or practices.
1:51:34
This aligns with my lengthy experience in working with technology transfer.
1:51:36
However, despite an intent to do this, that did not happen during the original NW
1:51:36
Forest Plan process in the Northwest, or
1:51:50
by those in Washington D.C. later on.
1:51:51
Knowing what the scientists were going to unleash upon the management class?
1:51:57
Right.
1:51:58
Might not be received with as much openness.
1:52:01
Right.
1:52:01
As it could if they were at least partially involved.
1:52:04
Right.
1:52:04
Is that a good way
1:52:06
-- The administration, frankly, didn't trust the agency.
1:52:10
You're talking about the Clinton administration?
1:52:12
The National Forest System portion of our agency was not particularly
1:52:15
trusted by the Clinton administration.
1:52:19
And so, I think that it was a trust issue that kept that from happening.
1:52:29
Any
1:52:33
experience,
1:52:36
person or memory that is particularly poignant from that process, something
1:52:41
you haven't brought up so far, a funny story, an anecdote, a brouhaha?
1:52:48
Anything interesting that would tell us something.
1:53:04
I have more quiet memories.
1:53:06
I had no reason of talking to Jack about his career, but there
1:53:15
was down time, and I remember him going through his whole career with
1:53:21
me, which was very interesting.
1:53:24
He had been a forester himself.
1:53:27
That's where he started, and then he'd gone into wildlife biology.
1:53:30
He was a very good communicator, and he was from east Texas.
1:53:38
I don't know what it is about east Texas, but many singers and
1:53:42
orators come out of east Texas.
1:53:44
He
1:53:48
had a way of speaking about things that were quite complex,
1:53:54
but cutting to the chase.
1:53:55
He would do that at the meetings, too.
1:53:58
What normally happened is, he would let
1:54:02
different scientists go at it a little bit.
1:54:07
They would argue about things, and I have
1:54:14
to state again, this is the scientific process.
1:54:19
You're pitting ideas against each other in order to make an informed
1:54:25
decision about the path you're going on.
1:54:27
Jack would let that take place, which it needed to, because this
1:54:31
was an intellectual endeavor.
1:54:33
People, through conversation were talking about new concepts, what
1:54:40
ramifications were for different approaches, the integrity of
1:54:45
information, the lack of information,
1:54:50
and the risks associated with making different assumptions.
1:54:58
There was a lot of discussion about all this.
1:55:01
But we had to wrap up every night.
1:55:03
Right?
1:55:03
And the other thing, scientists can go on and on like this.
1:55:06
They get a lot of energy from it, actually.
1:55:08
They can be quite introverts, but get them in this kind of milieu,
1:55:11
this group of people at any rate,
1:55:15
they're all competitive.
1:55:16
There were egos.
1:55:18
They had to foster that, hype that and turn the energy up a little bit.
1:55:23
But Jack would weigh in at the end [of a day] and he could be a sense-maker,
1:55:30
saying, “Here's what we've been looking at, where we are tonight. This is where
1:55:36
we're at now at the end of the day. This is where we'll jump off of tomorrow.”
1:55:41
So that was a way of organizing.
1:55:44
It was quite organized in this regard.
1:55:46
What do you feel the balance was between the terrestrial, the aquatic, the social
1:55:50
science, and the economics people?
1:55:52
It was totally biological.
1:55:53
I mean, just there's such a biological bias to the whole thing.
1:55:58
That's what I thought.
1:56:00
Just reading the documents and the energy of the policy, you
1:56:04
can see that in the documents.
1:56:05
And that greatly frustrated my team, the social science assessment team.
1:56:08
Right.
1:56:09
Greatly frustrated that team.
1:56:12
You know, economics had a little bit more, a little bit more standing.
1:56:18
The biological, the terrestrial and aquatic, were pretty much stealing the
1:56:26
show in some regards, you could say.
1:56:29
You guys are studying that “squishy stuff;” culture and ethics and values.
1:56:35
It wasn't considered in quite high regard.
1:56:38
I mean, there was this notion at that time about the “hard”
1:56:41
sciences and “soft” sciences.
1:56:41
And the hard sciences had
1:56:49
a little bit more macho.
1:56:51
I
1:56:56
do think probably part of that came from what you were talking about earlier,
1:57:00
that for a long time, while the agency was dominated by forestry [people]
1:57:05
, and sort of the terrestrial, but not terrestrial in a broad concept of it;
1:57:10
we're talking about trees and timber.
1:57:14
Right, crops.
1:57:14
And crops, or, maybe ecology, but forest ecology, looking at trees,
1:57:20
tree-centered forest ecology.
1:57:22
Right.
1:57:22
Then you have like Jerry Franklin, who had expanded that to more of an
1:57:27
ecological view, looking at things like the process and function of forests.
1:57:31
That was big.
1:57:33
Here's an opportunity to really look at that, which it hadn't been up to then.
1:57:39
Here was a way to really get those concepts across.
1:57:42
To actually put on the ground these concepts that scientists had been coming
1:57:48
up with in their studies over decades.
1:57:51
How does a forest really function?
1:57:54
And how does that relate to wildlife habitat?
1:57:58
And then, how does that all relate to aquatics?
1:58:01
That was sort of the cutting edge at that time.
1:58:03
So,
1:58:07
I think there was some part of it that isn't just hard versus soft science.
1:58:11
I think it was the state of science at that time.
1:58:14
There was a lot going on in those arenas.
1:58:16
There were a lot of scientists, who by then had a body of
1:58:20
work that said something
1:58:24
worth taking a look at in terms of implications for the
1:58:28
forests and their management.
1:58:32
In terms of current regulations, there was a complex array of regulations and
1:58:38
objectives that were being discussed.
1:58:41
The social side, not so much.
1:58:46
In many ways, it was a bit in its infancy, I think, just in the last decade.
1:58:50
The social sciences.
1:58:51
Especially within the agency, too, though.
1:58:52
Oh, yeah, for sure.
1:58:54
Back then, I mean.
1:58:55
Or, in the agency, they were much that way, yeah.
1:58:59
Now, Jerry Franklin may have been very controversial to the
1:59:02
traditional forestry people, but he was still talking about trees.
1:59:05
He still spoke the same language.
1:59:07
He spoke the same language.
1:59:07
Right, and New Forestry was maybe not liked by some people because it made
1:59:12
them have to work harder or think harder or change their paradigms,
1:59:16
but it was still tree-centered.
1:59:18
Right, and people could understand it.
1:59:21
I think any forester understood what Jerry was saying.
1:59:25
But, whether they agreed with some of the assumptions?
1:59:29
That was quite another matter.
1:59:33
In terms of the balance factor, what do you mean when you say that the
1:59:36
aquatics people also had to fight for equal air time with the terrestrial?
1:59:41
I think they felt they had to have a little bit more.
1:59:42
Okay.
1:59:43
I think there was some sense of that.
1:59:45
So, they were pretty aggressive in this regard.
1:59:47
And I think,
1:59:51
yes, but they had to work hard at it.
1:59:54
Because of the story about how the aquatic thing even got entered into the
1:59:59
dialogue at the time of the congressional hearings a couple years before.
2:00:04
And Gordon Reeves and Jim Sedell were part of that process.
2:00:10
Right.
2:00:11
The Forest Service Chief was not very happy that another monkey wrench was
2:00:17
thrown into the gears, so to speak.
2:00:22
And that wasn't even them trying.
2:00:24
They just basically spoke what they thought was the truth, and
2:00:26
they were small fry at that time.
2:00:29
But it made things more complicated.
2:00:32
I mean, whether it has to do with egos and power and traditional terrestrial
2:00:36
versus this or that, this was just another story that came out of this whole thing.
2:00:43
The aquatics folks were the -ologists, whereas the terrestrial people were
2:00:50
more traditional, although there were more and more ecologists at that time.
2:00:56
There was a real shift around this time from traditional silvicultural
2:01:02
Scientists [to something new] . What was happening in the Pink Tower
2:01:08
had ramifications for who we hired, and how our money was spent
2:01:12
at the PNW Station afterwards.
2:01:15
It was a pivotal moment because we suddenly had to support implementation
2:01:20
of the Northwest Forest Plan [NWFP]
2:01:23
. And the whole monitoring network that would develop after a while.
2:01:28
[To support and test various aspects of the NWFP – especially monitoring.]
2:01:28
The monitoring.
2:01:28
We'll talk about that here in just--
2:01:29
And the “Survey and Manage
2:01:32
” program.
2:01:32
Suddenly, the station had to make dramatic choices related to the follow-up work from
2:01:34
the NWFP, including for Survey and Manage.
2:01:38
This resulted in jobs
2:01:43
being eliminated in some fields within the PNW, such as in
2:01:43
Forest Operations, for example.
2:01:43
You mean, traditional forestry people?
2:01:45
Yeah, like some
2:01:49
entomologists.
2:01:49
Positions weren't filled, things like that.
2:01:52
When you look at this big book [referencing FEMAT report] , what
2:01:55
does that tell you today?
2:01:57
I mean, you were a part, you wrote a lot, and you wrote at least
2:01:59
some of the social science part.
2:02:01
Right?
2:02:01
Uh-huh.
2:02:04
When you look at it today, what does it make you think about?
2:02:18
I
2:02:21
think about so many things, but
2:02:27
especially a couple.
2:02:29
One is how nothing
2:02:33
like this has ever happened since, and probably won't again, where you
2:02:37
bring a group of scientists together.
2:02:40
That the outcome of this, I often look at this and think, it's too bad we
2:02:47
weren't able to work a little better with the National Forest System on
2:02:50
this in terms of implementation.
2:02:53
The scientists were so burned out.
2:02:55
I see a lot of the scientists kind of went their way, and the Record of Decision
2:03:01
was developed by another group of people, and there wasn't a lot of interplay.
2:03:05
So, when I look at this [FEMAT] , I think that's kind of a stand-alone
2:03:09
document, and from an era and
2:03:16
important point-in-time.
2:03:17
And I think we're better off for it having happened, from a science perspective.
2:03:23
But, I think there were ramifications
2:03:30
economically, and things
2:03:35
that could have been handled a little better.
2:03:38
In terms of weighting the things we're talking about within the
2:03:42
dynamic of the planning itself,
2:03:47
reflected in the problems with implementation over time in terms of how
2:03:52
it was thought through or not thought through; do you think that was because
2:03:55
there was a focus on this and not on that?
2:03:58
And I'm speaking mainly about the terrestrial and the aquatic, the
2:04:01
ecology, the non-human ecology, or largely non-human ecology, but the
2:04:07
other was not prioritized enough, and therefore, the plan was implemented.
2:04:13
And some problems that were already there, they got worse or maybe weren't
2:04:17
addressed quickly enough in certain areas.
2:04:19
I'm talking about traditional communities and economics, obviously,
2:04:22
but there's other things that you might want to think about, too, in
2:04:25
regard to that train of thought.
2:04:27
Well, what this plan says in Option 9 is 1 billion board-feet [harvest per
2:04:31
annum] . That never got implemented.
2:04:38
So, in this plan was a recognition of the importance of the
2:04:42
timber industry to communities.
2:04:44
Right.
2:04:44
That
2:04:49
never happened, and that's a pretty complicated story.
2:04:56
Others could talk to that probably better than I could.
2:05:00
There
2:05:04
were a lot of lawsuits.
2:05:05
A lot of things happened that the National Forest System had to deal with.
2:05:14
Again, it probably would have been better if they'd been
2:05:19
involved.
2:05:19
Now, there's a synthesis being developed and we're not using this as a model.
2:05:26
When I look at this now, I think, "This is a good learning opportunity."
2:05:30
We want to bear in mind things that we thought were shortcomings
2:05:33
here, [NWFP] and not repeat those.
2:05:36
That's something I actually deal with now.
2:05:43
But there are people who say, well, this was a good model,
2:05:48
why can't scientists do this again?
2:05:52
So, we have to explain that.
2:05:54
Well, actually, the interviewees, most of them have said, this is
2:05:59
probably not a good model in the sense of it being able to be used again
2:06:03
because of many different factors.
2:06:06
It was like a one-time thing.
2:06:08
It was a one-time thing, yeah.
2:06:10
It was a really phenomenal thing that happened.
2:06:15
It was a synergy and a paradigm-shifting moment.
2:06:19
It gave science a voice it never had before.
2:06:24
Right.
2:06:24
But it was maybe a little too isolated from the rest of the
2:06:29
world, and therefore, some of those problems maybe grew out of that.
2:06:33
Now, speaking to that, now, Alternative 9, how well do you think that got it right,
2:06:39
as best as you can in a zoning scheme that you're laying over this incredibly
2:06:46
complex tableau of society and ecology and geography and economic systems?
2:06:54
I mean, how well do you think that got it as right as it
2:06:57
could, versus other options?
2:06:59
I think there were ten final candidates?
2:07:09
[NWFP]
2:07:10
I wrote silviculture prescriptions which
2:07:17
look at all factors, and you determine how you're going to cut forest.
2:07:22
But, the real point for me of being a silviculturist is not to do it to cut
2:07:27
trees, it's to manage your forest, to
2:07:36
look at the objectives that you are trying to accomplish, and you're taking
2:07:40
action that will help people attain those.
2:07:46
Pieces of this do that with Option [Alternative] 9.
2:08:01
The reserve system has some value.
2:08:05
The Matrix
2:08:09
has some value,
2:08:13
to learn from.
2:08:13
But did we get it right?
2:08:16
I don't think there is a “getting it right,” but it's something you're
2:08:20
working towards, figuring it out.
2:08:22
I think part of the dynamic nature of forests is
2:08:26
such that, if you're going to
2:08:30
put a set of reserves across the landscape, you need to be
2:08:34
thinking about what we've found.
2:08:37
We did that when we didn't know about climate change.
2:08:40
Being that, reserves were set aside in
2:08:49
a time when maybe they were
2:08:52
needed.
2:08:53
I think a piece of it was related to social acceptability of
2:08:58
various practices that are behind
2:09:02
the scenes.
2:09:03
So, I think the social pieces in Option 9 are there, they're just aren't explicit.
2:09:09
Right?
2:09:11
One billion board-feet, that's a social thing.
2:09:13
Reserves?
2:09:14
Yes.
2:09:14
That was the social nod to people who wanted to preserve forests.
2:09:19
Matrix lands, that's a bit of a nod to people who wanted something
2:09:24
kind of in-between things.
2:09:28
And the AMA's?
2:09:29
[Adaptive Management Areas]
2:09:30
Well, the AMA's did not work at all.
2:09:32
And that was--
2:09:32
Except for the Central Cascades [and Applegate AMA, South.
2:09:34
Ore.] , and that was because of a certain group of people that were more invested?
2:09:38
They were already kind of in place before hand.
2:09:42
Yeah.
2:09:46
The Adaptive Management Areas [AMAs] probably were the biggest failure
2:09:49
in terms of actual implementation.
2:09:54
I actually at one point was helping with the Adaptive Management Areas.
2:10:00
We had a number of them, and I was here when the station
2:10:04
director took that funding [AMAs] and shifted it somewhere else.
2:10:07
The little bit of money there was to
2:10:11
support those.
2:10:12
There was money from the region and there was money from the station.
2:10:15
First, the region decided not to spend money on those anymore, and
2:10:19
then the station . You know, if you're not going to have support?
2:10:25
How long did it take to get to that point?
2:10:27
Not very long.
2:10:28
It was '95 was when the official report to the President and Congress was
2:10:32
published, and everything goes into practice in '95-'96, and you start
2:10:35
developing your monitoring plans.
2:10:37
Right.
2:10:38
How long did it take for them to say, wow, the AMA idea is not going to work?
2:10:41
By the late '90s?
2:10:43
They were just not a success at the level envisioned during FEMAT.
2:10:45
I believe successes of the two AMAs mentioned had less to do with the
2:10:45
NFWP, but a continuum of work done by scientists and managers already dedicated
2:10:45
to adaptive management as a concept.
2:10:45
The AMAs also did not get the focus at the regional level as reserves
2:10:45
and other ideas in the NWFP did.
2:10:45
Good work
2:10:48
did occur in some AMAs and adaptive management remained a key concept,
2:10:53
but they were not central to the implementation of the NWFP,
2:10:53
nor where they taken up to the regional level like reserves and
2:10:53
other concepts in the NWFP did.
2:10:53
Whose idea was that?
2:10:54
Adaptive Management Areas?
2:10:56
George Stankey and Roger Clark came up with that concept as part of FEMAT,
2:10:58
although it was informed by others, and it had roots in British Columbia
2:10:58
forestry practices before FEMAT.
2:11:00
It was quite interesting that the biological sciences really
2:11:00
took hold of concept, although it was more social in nature.
2:11:00
Okay.
2:11:00
This is around tech, you know, around the notion that people have to demonstrate
2:11:05
and then learn [AMAs/adaptive management].
2:11:06
Okay, got you.
2:11:06
The other piece was experimentation; the
2:11:10
idea that you take management actions, work with the
2:11:13
community, and learn together.
2:11:17
Then you would make changes and shifts.
2:11:19
That's why it was so uncomfortable when you asked about Option 9,
2:11:23
and why did this work, or not.
2:11:25
Oh, I wasn't trying to put it in an absolute sense.
2:11:27
I was just trying to compare it to all the options to be considered.
2:11:27
Oh, I knew you weren't.
2:11:29
Yeah, all the options.
2:11:32
But part of my hemming and hawing, is around that fact you need to be able to
2:11:41
implement things and learn from them, adjust and move forward.
2:11:45
There really hasn't been any of that.
2:11:47
The reserves have been kind of set in stone.
2:11:50
The Matrix lands, they're almost done with their thinning, up to
2:11:57
80-year-old stands.
2:12:00
So, we're now at a point where the scientists and Jerry Franklin are asking,
2:12:05
okay, what does this say about the whole forest that you want into the future
2:12:11
and age classes, and the complexity of forests across the landscape?
2:12:16
Right.
2:12:17
You’ve got more of it with Option 9.
2:12:19
Is it enough?
2:12:21
Does it have enough flexibility, enough
2:12:28
ability, to have varied stands and conditions
2:12:35
to function as habitat for these species?
2:12:38
And of course, the spotted owl, but I think we're kind of at a
2:12:39
point where the spotted owl is,
2:12:48
well….The station for a long time has talked about collections of
2:12:50
species, not just one, trying to keep the whole collection of species.
2:12:55
I am sure Bruce Marcot understands the whole biodiversity aspect of it.
2:13:00
We know more about that.
2:13:01
We know a lot more about these systems now than we did just a short 24 years ago.
2:13:16
Many questions must have been asked.
2:13:16
This is interesting, earth-shaking, in how habitat for the spotted owl,
2:13:21
became the pivotal thing in this plan.
2:13:27
The murrelet,
2:13:30
I won't say it was an outlier, but it was secondary.
2:13:33
Then of course, the whole deal was expanded to include more species,
2:13:39
especially under Survey and Manage, and what does that all mean in practice?
2:13:43
Right.
2:13:43
What do you remember about when you first heard about the spotted owl,
2:13:46
the ESA, this building “thing,” and then, the centrality of that in terms
2:13:51
of the zoning and reserve system, and how they came up with that scheme?
2:13:55
Well, there was a notion that the owl was kind of a surrogate, for--
2:14:00
The whole forest?
2:14:02
Well, from the environmental community, they use it as a symbol.
2:14:07
And the goal was to stop cutting those big, old trees.
2:14:10
Right.
2:14:11
And then, from a scientific perspective, maybe there's a notion that it's
2:14:18
kind of a keystone species, or a species that's emblematic of a whole
2:14:22
suite of species that are important for an ecosystem to function.
2:14:27
Right.
2:14:29
We call it resilience now.
2:14:30
We didn't use that term back then, but the idea is that you have a resilient forest
2:14:34
that can withstand change and shifts.
2:14:37
Now with climate change, it's very important to be thinking about that.
2:14:46
We thought we were on a trajectory.
2:14:48
You asked this notion of progress, of being on a trajectory towards a future.
2:14:54
For a forester, it's like we're going to have sustained-yields.
2:14:58
These notions are all very directional, as is this notion
2:15:05
there’s a state we can get to that is “idyllic.” But that's not really the
2:15:11
way, realizing that given the dynamics of what you're looking for is no one state.
2:15:21
You're looking more at
2:15:24
resilience [perspective] that can kind of weather the change, and that
2:15:30
resilience probably comes with people.
2:15:33
We've got to try some new things, see what works and what doesn't work.
2:15:40
I think progress, not perfection, a phrase you'll hear in a lot of different
2:15:46
contexts, is kind of what you're saying.
2:15:49
And although I would say that a lot of people in their minds, will often
2:15:55
take an ideal or a perfect ideal and they'll put it out as what should be.
2:16:02
Right.
2:16:02
Rather than, this synergistic progression.
2:16:06
And I think those things are always in collision, including now, what
2:16:09
we're talking about right here.
2:16:10
Yeah, so it's kind of a balancing out.
2:16:15
You've got to do something, right?
2:16:16
I mean, there's going to be activity, whether you do something actually
2:16:22
or not, there's going to be a consequence in terms of forests.
2:16:27
So, you've got this whole spectrum, a philosophy around
2:16:33
how to move that forward.
2:16:36
In terms of the science,
2:16:39
what our role is to bring the information that we have about these systems to bear?
2:16:46
And we know that the complexity is such that
2:16:54
it's not straightforward.
2:16:59
It's not straightforward so
2:17:14
there's one kind of set of activities such as they are outlined here.
2:17:20
That reserve system in Option 9; we wouldn't come up with that today.
2:17:33
You can always look at things in the rearview mirror and say, well, would
2:17:36
have, should have, could have, and--
2:17:38
But, would we be doing the science we're doing today to get
2:17:41
to where we did without FEMAT?
2:17:43
No.
2:17:45
This was highly influential, I mean, what people assembled, and the information
2:17:51
and the way they looked at it.
2:17:52
Take off on that thought, Cindy.
2:17:54
Yeah.
2:17:54
Okay, say something about what you just said?
2:17:58
Yeah, so, I'm getting a little tired.
2:18:03
Can we take a break?
2:18:04
[Break]
2:18:05
. We were talking about the aftermath, and that's probably an incorrect word,
2:18:11
because it's kind of a negative one, but how things unfolded after FEMAT.
2:18:17
The FEMAT was done.
2:18:19
It was this incredible “cram session” and synergy of the sciences, and
2:18:25
it did something never done before, at least in the American context.
2:18:33
Then, a different set of people took over.
2:18:37
Jerry Franklin called them "the second team." He basically expressed
2:18:40
the opinion of other key people.
2:18:41
Even Jack [Ward Thomas] was unhappy with a few things in here.
2:18:43
I didn't have a chance to interview him, but he
2:18:55
thought that Survey and Manage didn't help implementation [NWFP]
2:18:59
. Yes.
2:19:00
Maybe you can talk about that a little bit?
2:19:03
I'm talking about the Record of Decision, Standards and Guidelines that came out,
2:19:07
basically, right after FEMAT; the guide to how this was going to be implemented.
2:19:15
I probably have a little different viewpoint of this.
2:19:18
I believe that we were remiss in the science community
2:19:22
because we simply handed it off.
2:19:25
And we did not work with the land managers.
2:19:28
Okay.
2:19:28
I think they did the best that they could.
2:19:30
Okay.
2:19:30
We were not with them.
2:19:33
I believe it’s probably complicated, and I don't know the reason for that.
2:19:38
I know there was, because of this attitude, we were the “first team”
2:19:46
and they were the “second,” there's a lot there, the distinctions
2:19:53
were, I think, more than just distinctions.
2:19:55
I think walls were put up.
2:19:58
The land managers felt locked out of the room by the scientists.
2:20:03
I wasn't making a judgment.
2:20:03
Oh no, I know.
2:20:05
I was trying to make a comment about how certain people in high places
2:20:09
viewed what happened afterwards.
2:20:10
No, but I think--
2:20:13
But you're explaining more context, and thank you.
2:20:16
I think there was a bit of conflict because of the Pink
2:20:20
Tower, everybody being put in a room, and certain people left out.
2:20:25
The very people who were left out [managers] were the ones that were
2:20:28
going to have to move forward with this.
2:20:30
I think there were some individuals who might have crossed over, a few people that
2:20:36
had their foot in both places [science and management] . I remember thinking
2:20:40
after FEMAT, where are the scientists?
2:20:42
I was in the building where this was developed, and I didn't see
2:20:47
scientists anywhere for months.
2:20:48
[USFS PNW and Region 6 offices] , mostly managers at that time,
2:20:50
charged with implementing NWFP.
2:20:50
But just to play devil's advocate about why maybe that happened, and this is just
2:20:53
something I'm thinking out loud right now as we're doing this interview, perhaps the
2:20:59
science people who had to drop everything.
2:21:02
They were tired.
2:21:02
For three months.
2:21:03
They were exhausted.
2:21:04
They were exhausted [Extremely long work hours for months]
2:21:04
. And they had a huge backlog with their regular work, so when they left this,
2:21:11
they went back and said, "Wow, I've got to go back and get my regular stuff
2:21:15
going again," keep it going, or whatever.
2:21:17
Absolutely.
2:21:18
I'm just playing devil's advocate about why maybe there was a disconnect
2:21:23
between FEMAT, “whew, that's over,” and then, “here, take it away.”
2:21:27
Oh, no, no, no.
2:21:28
That, I think, is an accurate description.
2:21:30
Okay.
2:21:30
But as a result, there was this kind of wall between these two documents [FEMAT
2:21:39
and Record of Decision] . They should have been a bit more [of a
2:21:41
connection] . They're based on each other, but there's some disconnect.
2:21:44
Right?
2:21:45
I think you used the word disconnect.
2:21:47
People were very tired.
2:21:48
[post-FEMAT] . And hey, I wasn't around.
2:21:49
I had the baby, and took six months maternity leave after that.
2:21:54
My baby came two months early, too.
2:21:56
There's always an excuse, Cindy.
2:21:56
[Laughs]
2:21:56
Right, so I was not around.
2:21:57
I know.
2:21:59
So, I don't really know what happened.
2:22:04
All I know is that when I came back, I knew that our scientists had been
2:22:09
burned out and they were trying to get their lives back together.
2:22:11
I mean, it was hard on people's personal lives and their academic ones.
2:22:17
They had papers and going to panels.
2:22:19
And, this FEMAT report was out of the realm of normal work.
2:22:26
Their normal flow of work, and they had to scramble to put everything back together.
2:22:28
And it was field season, so a lot of them were doing field
2:22:31
work or had crews and things like that and things to think about.
2:22:36
And then the managers did the best they could.
2:22:39
Right.
2:22:39
That's what this [became] , I think the Record of Decision.
2:22:45
Now, where do you think the problems were?
2:22:49
If you were going to say, let's compare the good, bad or whatever
2:22:55
[Various aspects of NWFP]
2:22:55
. Right.
2:22:55
But if you were going to say, in retrospect, this would have been better
2:23:00
if -- ? And also talk about the Record of Decision/Standards and Guidelines.
2:23:05
Gosh, I haven't looked at this for so long.
2:23:08
The main thing I think about, and I know Jack Ward Thomas was not happy
2:23:12
with it, the “Survey and Manage”
2:23:18
concept.
2:23:18
It seems unrealistic in terms of labor, time and energy in the field.
2:23:22
[Orig.
2:23:22
application of ESA in NWFP was for two species, spotted owl and marbled murrelet,
2:23:22
some fish were added; “survey and manage” potentially added hundreds of species.]
2:23:22
Absolutely.
2:23:22
It being a kind of a “paralysis through analysis” kind of thing,
2:23:28
because you increase the potential species list or ecosystem impact
2:23:34
list to almost everything.
2:23:36
All of a sudden, you're in trouble [in management calculus]
2:23:38
. Right, absolutely.
2:23:39
That's the one, personally, that just glares at me.
2:23:42
Yeah, and the other is the aquatic conservation strategy.
2:23:46
The notion was that
2:23:50
we had this system of streams, they were going to be assessed, and through
2:23:55
that assessment, portions of that landscape would be subject to management.
2:24:00
You can manage them, right?
2:24:02
Instead, it became almost
2:24:06
like there was an inability to
2:24:14
do anything.
2:24:14
Watershed analysis is systematic procedure for characterizing watershed
2:24:18
and ecological processes to meet specific management and social objectives.
2:24:25
They anticipated that watershed analysis would occur, they'd
2:24:29
look at the headwaters,
2:24:33
and so, these headwater streams all of a sudden had buffers around
2:24:38
them and it was very difficult to manage those lands because of that.
2:24:44
That's another factor.
2:24:47
And I don't know the intent of the Record of Decision.
2:24:50
I don't know enough about it to have an opinion.
2:24:52
Well, it's an infinitely complex thing.
2:24:54
And you can easily take an easy phrase out of something that people toss around
2:24:59
and throw it against the wall, because the life is much more complicated than that,
2:25:02
institutions are much more complicated, politics are much more complicated.
2:25:09
Yeah.
2:25:11
Well.
2:25:11
Now, when you come back from your six months maternity leave,
2:25:20
what was the feeling around the Station?
2:25:24
This giant thing had happened, and I know people realized that.
2:25:29
But what was the spirit of the agency or this entity?
2:25:35
Even the Forest Service in general, mainly through your window here.
2:25:38
[PNW Station]
2:25:38
. Well, on the whole, I think
2:25:43
people felt good about it.
2:25:45
There was a lot of satisfaction in having risen to the challenge,
2:25:51
and having produced something that was being implemented
2:25:56
through the Record of Decision.
2:25:58
Right.
2:26:00
I think there was a sense there was some disconnect, but
2:26:07
overall, people were getting back to their work they were doing.
2:26:12
But they also were recognizing that from
2:26:19
a research perspective, managing a research station, there was
2:26:23
a sense of, “ah,” we're going to have to make some shifts.
2:26:28
And we've got a limited budget; we didn't get a big increase in budget
2:26:35
with this [Staff from ranger districts often helped with gathering data]
2:26:37
. To do the monitoring?
2:26:37
Monitoring.
2:26:37
Right.
2:26:39
There were some monies for monitoring, and so, working with Region 5 and
2:26:43
Region 6 [NWFP-mostly Region 6, plus No.
2:26:45
Cal., Region 5] , plans for monitoring had to be set up.
2:26:47
There tension around the thinking that the research station should do the monitoring.
2:26:55
Our managers said, "We'll do the protocols. But we don't have the money
2:27:01
or staff to do the monitoring. That's your job." We did the development
2:27:06
of protocols for the monitoring.
2:27:09
And then there was some monitoring, the northern spotted owl monitoring.
2:27:14
This is one of the early documents here, right?
2:27:18
Yes, that was what the purpose of that document was.
2:27:22
This is from 1999, "The Strategy and Design of the Effectiveness Monitoring
2:27:25
Program for the Northwest Forest Plan," what I'm holding right now,
2:27:28
which is PNW-GTR 437, January 1999.
2:27:33
Yes, so that was big.
2:27:40
The people that it took, the scientists that we needed to hire, the grad students
2:27:46
and that kind of thing, they started to need different kinds of backgrounds
2:27:49
than what we had previously had.
2:27:52
How so?
2:27:53
Well, from what I remember, we made decisions
2:27:59
to decrease the size of our entomology and pathology expertise, because
2:28:04
we had to have forest ecology.
2:28:08
We hired a lot of ecologists.
2:28:11
They could have been foresters, but we hired a lot of research ecologists.
2:28:17
In other words, people that could--
2:28:18
Broader.
2:28:19
People that could do
2:28:23
less atomistic, but more general, holistic studies, which may fit better
2:28:29
with the needs of the monitoring plan?
2:28:31
Is that why?
2:28:31
Well, no, I think, people that had more understanding of function and process
2:28:36
of ecosystems, and how to study them.
2:28:40
Okay.
2:28:41
Versus people who studied
2:28:44
-- Bugs, or what have you?
2:28:45
Bugs, or disease, or trees.
2:28:50
That was one outcome.
2:28:51
I'm trying
2:28:58
to come up with one more.
2:29:06
One nice thing was we got a positive reputation for this work, within
2:29:16
the agency and scientific community.
2:29:19
These people, our folks, everyone wanted to talk to them.
2:29:25
There was a lot of demand on the scientists to consult or to give papers.
2:29:34
The Yale Forestry Department, one of the professors there, started studying
2:29:39
the whole process [NWFP] . Our scientists and the work we did,
2:29:43
all of this was being studied.
2:29:46
So,
2:29:52
now you were in the “petri dish.”
2:29:53
And it became internationally influential.
2:29:54
I remember Jerry Franklin bringing the head forester from China
2:29:57
to visit station leadership.
2:30:00
He laid out this plan for China, which he implemented, had a reserve
2:30:05
system, had places where they were going to do afforestation [putting
2:30:10
trees where they had not ever been, or for some time] . It was definitely
2:30:13
influenced by some of the approaches.
2:30:19
Maybe it's taking a leap there, but I suspect that's true.
2:30:22
I've also heard Australia actually took aspects of the model from
2:30:31
FEMAT.
2:30:31
One of the interviewees mentioned that.
2:30:33
I'm not sure if that's true.
2:30:35
Yeah, and
2:30:40
-- I think one idea that's attractive is
2:30:45
that you get a bunch of experts together.
2:30:46
This has been true for a lot of governments, technocratic
2:30:50
aspects, economists, and the time to address big questions.
2:30:53
What we really need is a bunch of super-smart people to start
2:30:57
making decisions, and for the politicians to stay out of the way.
2:31:03
I think that's part of the attractiveness.
2:31:05
You
2:31:08
come up with an objective, an analytical construct, to make good,
2:31:13
sound policy, that isn't waving in the political winds, if you will.
2:31:18
Right.
2:31:20
And I think that was the intent.
2:31:22
But I also believe it wasn't really in a political framework.
2:31:27
I
2:31:38
think
2:31:41
the framework needed to come up with some options.
2:31:53
There was this notion that the scientists had to come up with an option.
2:32:00
I think that created kind of a difficult situation, as it was hard to extricate
2:32:09
the science from politics in some regards, because there was a president [Clinton]
2:32:16
putting folks in the room, keeping others out of the room, and also weighing in.
2:32:22
I believe they weighed in on Option 9.
2:32:31
How well do you think the group performed the social assessment analysis your group
2:32:35
was charged with, and how do you think the analysis has held the test of time?
2:32:47
One problem with the social assessment was a lack of data.
2:32:50
One of the things we found out right away was that all the
2:32:53
data the different districts and forests had, wasn't compatible.
2:32:58
They didn't collect the same data in the same way.
2:33:01
So, that was a really big challenge.
2:33:04
Well, one problem I saw with the 90-day thing, or 60 days,
2:33:10
that it was impossible to do original research.
2:33:13
Everything is a synthesis and you're depending completely
2:33:16
on what is already out there.
2:33:17
And there wasn't much social science out there.
2:33:20
I think, given what there was available, it covered the various aspects
2:33:30
of social science that it could.
2:33:34
For instance, at the Andrews LTER, and the social science component in
2:33:39
forest governance, they're trying to develop a plan that will study
2:33:42
the Willamette National Forest, or the Andrews, centered on that.
2:33:46
There's basically three riparian corridors, Santiam,
2:33:48
McKenzie and Willamette.
2:33:49
That is kind of the main construct.
2:33:51
But there's not really good data.
2:33:55
Right.
2:33:58
They're finding out that they’ve got to do serious research to find the data.
2:34:05
Roger [Clark] brought in a bunch of people to try to get that information.
2:34:06
Right.
2:34:10
There was a huge effort.
2:34:11
They brought in people from all the districts and
2:34:25
elsewhere.
2:34:25
They brought them into a room, asked them for particular kinds of information,
2:34:31
and asked them to gather whatever they could [census records, county records,
2:34:36
timber receipts, etc.] They were doing the best they could with what they had.
2:34:42
That's kind of what Roger decided to do as the leader of the group?
2:34:45
Yeah.
2:34:46
And he recognized the limitations.
2:34:48
Absolutely, he recognized them.
2:34:49
And he says, well, this is what we've got and we're going to go from here.
2:34:53
Yes.
2:34:54
They then worked with this knowledge set, which in part illustrates
2:34:57
the notion of adaptive management.
2:35:00
From a science perspective, you work with the information you have,
2:35:03
and as you get more information, it's going to inform you.
2:35:06
For instance,
2:35:10
I mentioned Douglas-fir and clear-cutting.
2:35:12
In the '40s, they thought Douglas-fir needed total light.
2:35:18
The same scientist who did the studies in the '40s still works
2:35:21
at the station, Bob Curtis.
2:35:22
He is still around, took these studies all the way,
2:35:27
and he found Douglas-fir can grow in the shade.
2:35:32
You can do these different kinds of more complicated cutting
2:35:35
systems, and you're not going to completely shade out Douglas-fir.
2:35:40
He [Curtis] has
2:35:43
long-term data on this.
2:35:47
In 1940, the world looked very different than it looks today, from a scientific
2:35:52
perspective; simply based on data over time, and collecting data long enough
2:36:01
to actually learn what's what, what you want to get at, and what you can
2:36:07
do and what would happen if you do “X”?
2:36:10
In
2:36:13
terms of social science, wow, is it complicated!
2:36:16
People are a little bit more complicated, although, a tree has
2:36:21
more genes in its DNA than people.
2:36:28
But trees are less easily confused.
2:36:29
But in terms of -- [Laughs].
2:36:34
Right.
2:36:35
That just came out.
2:36:37
[Laughs]
2:36:37
But people are so complicated.
2:36:39
To study people, we do it with big data.
2:36:47
You even hear about social science on NPR, now.
2:36:50
A lot of it's because people are using big data, and they have
2:36:54
computing power to start getting at causalities in the social sciences.
2:37:03
But, they [FEMAT] didn't have that data then,
2:37:09
probably the biggest barrier they faced from where I was sitting.
2:37:16
The
2:37:19
Social Science Assessment Team; it was challenging and
2:37:26
we just had so much more information [to process] . But another aspect of that was,
2:37:33
by working together in FEMAT,
2:37:38
it did bring social scientists together.
2:37:40
There were relationships that
2:37:44
came from that and carried on after that, and work that carried on.
2:37:48
The whole FEMAT experience, those of us that were part of that,
2:37:53
we just appreciated each other.
2:37:55
I have such an appreciation for everyone I worked with during that experience.
2:38:02
You had a sense that everybody was learning;
2:38:09
the way they were thinking scientifically, the way they were
2:38:13
thinking, just as human beings and social creatures with careers and
2:38:21
lives.
2:38:21
It was like a high bar was set and everyone was striving for that higher bar.
2:38:26
And
2:38:29
it was under some difficult circumstances.
2:38:31
You came out of that forming bonds with people.
2:38:35
And gosh, they were smart.
2:38:38
What a brilliant group of people!
2:38:41
For me, it was such an honor.
2:38:43
I would go away from a day of work feeling like, wow, I just learned so much.
2:38:51
I just felt like I had the opportunity to work today with some incredible people.
2:38:58
How did I get so lucky?
2:39:00
And then to have continued some of those relationships, even as
2:39:05
people went on to other things.
2:39:07
Jim Sedell went on to being a Station Director for the Pacific
2:39:11
Southwest Research Station.
2:39:12
I worked with him a lot after FEMAT, and helped him out there.
2:39:19
Richard Haynes [Forest Economist] really is a mentor.
2:39:25
We worked a lot afterwards with the Northwest Forest Plan and the monitoring
2:39:29
reports, and with publishing, and he really helped me understand scientific
2:39:34
publishing as much as anybody did.
2:39:38
Roger Clark and George Stankey, I considered them to be friends, and
2:39:43
they were very good to work with, and I still am in contact with
2:39:49
them, even after they've retired.
2:39:51
I feel really good about that.
2:39:54
I actually have a deep respect for [Station Director] Charlie Philpott as
2:39:59
an administrator, under the circumstances of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:40:03
I think he may have been in one of the toughest positions, in terms
2:40:07
of assembling everyone, dealing with all the conflict, having the
2:40:12
pressure from the administration.
2:40:14
And then, having to really manage the aftermath.
2:40:17
He was the Station Director from what year to what year?
2:40:20
Oh, shoot.
2:40:21
The only reason I'm asking— [to frame NWFP process]
2:40:22
'88 or '87 to
2:40:30
'96, something like that?
2:40:31
So, basically, the whole--
2:40:32
The whole time.
2:40:33
From basically the buildup of the political war, the legal issues
2:40:39
and the Dwyer Decision, the ISC Report and Congress, everything
2:40:44
through until after the report?
2:40:47
[FEMAT/Record of Decision/NWFP/etc.]
2:40:47
Right, and he's another brilliant person.
2:40:49
That's a lot to go through.
2:40:51
Yeah.
2:40:52
And he has a brilliant mind as well.
2:41:02
Another piece of it [NWFP] that was difficult to see, is it
2:41:07
really was a grinding thing.
2:41:09
People did suffer from burnout.
2:41:12
Also,
2:41:16
some of them went into the Interior Columbia River Basin project, which
2:41:20
was supposed to be a bit like FEMAT, only over a longer amount of time.
2:41:24
That just went on for years and years.
2:41:26
So, between this effort [NWFP] and the Interior Columbia River Basin,
2:41:30
we really burned some people out.
2:41:32
And they weren't able to tend to their science.
2:41:36
Rise again, so to speak?
2:41:38
Sufficiently, and they weren't publishing.
2:41:40
They were going to panels, and these efforts were not really being
2:41:44
considered for paneling processes for them to advance in their career.
2:41:50
There was that piece, but a lot of them overcame that and went on to be
2:41:58
very influential, and I think, the whole thing, after sort of sputtering a
2:42:04
while, was a catalyst for great careers.
2:42:09
Well, a lot of them said,
2:42:14
a good percentage of the people I've interviewed, have said that this
2:42:18
was the highlight of their career.
2:42:22
Right, right.
2:42:22
And these are successful people and that have done a lot of publishing.
2:42:27
They have names in their fields.
2:42:29
But like this was like the high point.
2:42:33
I won't say names necessarily, but early their careers, they never thought
2:42:36
this was going to be the pinnacle, or something analogous to that.
2:42:39
Right.
2:42:42
We had actually somebody who came in afterwards as a manager, Steve
2:42:45
McDonald, and he was here during that time and he kept saying, "Well, these
2:42:49
are the good-old days, you know."
2:42:54
I think that's what he was saying.
2:42:56
What we're going through here, we're going to look back and we're going to
2:42:58
say those were the “good-old days,” the sense that this is really something.
2:43:10
How did this whole process affect your view about
2:43:17
ethics and humanity's responsibility toward nature and the world?
2:43:24
You obviously already had a background that would be considered
2:43:29
“conservationist,” but you evolved as a person, and how did the whole
2:43:34
Northwest Forest Plan either cement something you already had, or alter it?
2:43:40
How would you describe it as affecting your world view in terms
2:43:45
of morality, ethics and nature?
2:43:57
It was a step.
2:43:59
A group of people came together in the interest of nature and conservation.
2:44:00
A set of
2:44:15
science information was collected and key questions asked related
2:44:22
to complexity of forests and
2:44:30
how humans interact with nature.
2:44:37
It was a pivotal moment because it substantially shifted
2:44:43
how forests are managed.
2:44:45
Some of the most valuable forests, economically, went into reserve status.
2:44:53
The process for managing forests included new concepts
2:45:01
from the scientific community.
2:45:06
Scientists were to be objective through use the scientific process.
2:45:19
This
2:45:26
change did quell the
2:45:33
conflict from the perspective of those who viewed old-growth harvesting as mining
2:45:41
a resource that cannot be realistically replaced, and is thus, irreplaceable.
2:45:41
Action was taken to preserve the system
2:45:50
of forests for future generations.
2:45:56
Having said that, there were unintended consequences like
2:46:02
with anything we undergo.
2:46:05
Just
2:46:07
today, I am hearing we're facing climate change, another kind of issue.
2:46:17
Society will have society reconcile, for whatever reasons,
2:46:24
the system we operate in now.
2:46:27
It's very difficult to reconcile greater goods for future
2:46:32
generations, versus jobs for today.
2:46:37
I heard that on the radio today.
2:46:39
And I think we can describe that better in this part of the country because of
2:46:48
FEMAT, and the tension between those two.
2:46:52
My perception of the National Forest System is we've come out of
2:46:58
a period where socially, there was a huge discord after FEMAT came out.
2:47:03
It affected the whole Northwest.
2:47:05
In some towns, it really affected them.
2:47:08
In Skamania County [Wash.] , 98 percent of its lands are federal lands.
2:47:12
It was hugely impacted by the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:47:17
Other places were able to diversify their economies and actually do quite well.
2:47:26
We did some work around community viability.
2:47:29
Some communities were more viable than others.
2:47:33
This dichotomy between nature and humans is something that goes way back
2:47:41
to Thoreau and Emerson in our history.
2:47:42
We continue to struggle with this notion, yet we are part of things.
2:47:46
And way before that.
2:47:46
But, I think there is this trying to understand how we interact with
2:47:51
nature and how we come together.
2:47:54
They're saying, if we don't at least somehow recognize human
2:48:02
nature in terms of short-term need, versus the long-term greater good,
2:48:11
that is a problem.
2:48:11
Deal with that then, and that is, to me, the moral issue.
2:48:19
There's a lot of questions of morality in that.
2:48:23
So, I think we need to figure that out better.
2:48:28
We're trying, as a society.
2:48:31
And I believe the National Forest System, in this region,
2:48:37
is actually grappling with that.
2:48:41
Now, you talked about the monitoring and having to adjust things
2:48:47
to be able to budget for that.
2:48:52
How was the monitoring plan, network, and personnel determined, and how did it
2:48:59
shake out over the first five, six years?
2:49:01
And how do you feel it's played out over the last 20 years?
2:49:06
That would be a good question for Becky Gravenmier, because she was a
2:49:08
little closer to the region than I.
2:49:14
What I can say is that
2:49:21
we developed more protocols.
2:49:23
We've been monitoring the marbled murrelet and the spotted owl for some time now.
2:49:28
The Survey and Manage program went on its own kind of trajectory.
2:49:37
It's very hard to think of us continuing to monitor the spotted owl and the marbled
2:49:41
murrelet the way we're doing it, forever.
2:49:45
So, we probably need to take a look at that.
2:49:48
We are looking at different methods, methodologies and this kind of thing, but
2:49:54
there's a question there of how to move forward.
2:49:59
And we're doing a new forest synthesis.
2:50:02
So, part of what I'm involved with right now, and why we're doing
2:50:05
this history, probably why you want to do this, is we brought all the
2:50:10
authors together about a year ago.
2:50:12
They were meeting in the Portland lab.
2:50:14
The authors of?
2:50:17
Some of them were with FEMAT, and some of them are with the new forest synthesis.
2:50:21
Okay.
2:50:21
Which is a synthesis of science from the Northwest Forest Plan geography
2:50:28
looking at the science that's come out since the FEMAT report.
2:50:33
Right.
2:50:34
And so, we were all—I've lost my thought.
2:50:41
We were all there.
2:50:43
You were at some meeting or?
2:50:44
Yeah,
2:50:48
the point is that we're looking at the most current science, and that's
2:50:52
going to probably set a new course.
2:50:54
There's going to be a
2:50:57
bioregional assessment that's then going to take
2:51:05
information from the new synthesis.
2:51:09
And then there's really going to be a public process to work through that.
2:51:13
Do you think now that we're at 20-plus years, and you've had enough time to
2:51:18
reflect on this independently of the political maelstrom of the moment,
2:51:22
and science needs a decade or two to figure stuff out, that maybe there's
2:51:28
going to be a new assessment where you'll see where this was right,
2:51:32
where this was wrong, where it needs to be adjusted, amended, etc.?
2:51:35
Do you feel that going forward?
2:51:40
I think it's a little hard to know exactly because I don't work with
2:51:46
that side of the Forest Service.
2:51:49
What I do know is we are putting the information together, and there is new
2:51:55
understanding of how systems are working.
2:51:59
We're putting much more emphasis on the socio-economic piece.
2:52:03
We recognized the shortcomings of FEMAT.
2:52:05
That has
2:52:09
got more attention, and
2:52:19
the region is taking the next step of doing an assessment.
2:52:25
We are doing a synthesis of the science called the “Forest
2:52:29
Ecosystem Management and Ecological, Economic and Social Assessment.”
2:52:37
The region is actually going to do the assessment part, looking at the
2:52:41
whole region, which is going to look at other things besides science.
2:52:44
Right?
2:52:45
But we're putting together the new science related to the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:52:50
It's just science synthesis.
2:52:51
We’re looking at old-growth forests and vegetation.
2:52:53
We're looking at biodiversity.
2:52:56
We are going to consider climate change.
2:52:59
We're going to look at where the forest has been going the last
2:53:03
twenty years, which, by the way, is a short time for a forest.
2:53:06
Twenty years is just not--
2:53:08
That's my point about twenty years, it's just twenty years.
2:53:10
It's just not that long.
2:53:12
But there are some things we can see.
2:53:17
Is it working in terms of o ld growth?
2:53:19
Yes.
2:53:20
The old growth; we're not losing old growth.
2:53:23
Is there less loss of the old-growth forest type in these forests?
2:53:28
Yes.
2:53:29
That's working.
2:53:32
Those are some of the things that, if it's important to have old growth across
2:53:37
this landscape, then we have information about that and what the trend is.
2:53:45
Where are the losses and for what reasons, and how does that relate to
2:53:48
habitat, because that's the important piece, and those around the habitat of
2:53:53
the marbled murrelet and the spotted owl.
2:53:56
We've got a lot of new information on that.
2:53:59
From the monitoring all this time, we do have information that
2:54:05
can lead to some conclusions.
2:54:09
Now
2:54:12
that the new wild card is the barred owl.
2:54:20
What does that tell you about the focus on a single species that became
2:54:24
a symbol, but also a real biological indicator in terms of the ephemeral
2:54:31
nature of human plans for managing nature?
2:54:35
Right,
2:54:39
if you go down that primrose path, if you think that you're going to
2:54:46
figure it out at any given time, just when you think you have it figured
2:54:50
out, a barred owl lands on the scene.
2:54:52
Right?
2:54:57
That complicates it.
2:54:59
Does it mean what you've done up until the barred owl showed up, was wrong?
2:55:04
You want to make a judgment.
2:55:09
I think we should look forward.
2:55:11
What does this mean?
2:55:14
What are we trying to get out of these forests in terms of resiliency?
2:55:23
For me personally, what are we going to hand future generations?
2:55:33
How can we act today in a way that future generations will reap the same
2:55:41
benefits we do from forests, or more?
2:55:47
We don't want to degrade these forests.
2:55:49
I know what degraded forests look like.
2:55:52
Well, you grew up around one of the earliest examples in the U.S. context.
2:55:57
Right.
2:55:57
We were talking about that at the beginning of the interview.
2:56:01
I go back and there are no seed trees.
2:56:03
There were such expansive cuts, what came up were poplars, and what
2:56:10
can come back is nothing like what
2:56:17
the old logger saw who sold us our land for our cabin, forests 200
2:56:24
years old.
2:56:25
If you work in tropical forests, when we were dealing with issues of
2:56:31
degraded forest, it’s going to be 200 years before you see forests come
2:56:35
back anything like what was there.
2:56:43
For me, that is where the moral issue comes in.
2:56:47
That's what we need to look at.
2:56:48
I think
2:57:00
pretty much everyone shares that same idea, if you sit down at
2:57:06
a table and talk with folks.
2:57:07
After this process [NWFP] happened, especially the big
2:57:08
events, how many other regions, or
2:57:17
elsewhere in the Northwest, how many people wanted to learn from
2:57:23
this, or asked if they could take it and apply to other regions?
2:57:26
Obviously, there's different ecologies, different politics, but
2:57:32
the rest of the Forest Service,
2:57:37
how did they react to this?
2:57:38
I mean nationally, at meetings, in communiques, reports; this is interesting,
2:57:45
this could apply to us, we don't like this, or it's just a Northwest thing.
2:57:51
I'm not sure, but I know some of the other stations did.
2:57:56
There was a Southern Forest Assessment done, maybe a decade
2:58:02
ago, that maybe was a big influence.
2:58:05
This notion of doing assessments across great landscapes; that's
2:58:09
been done in the Lake States.
2:58:11
And I think it's informed forest planning in those situations.
2:58:16
But some of those regions, like the Southern Research Station, doesn't
2:58:21
have a lot of federal lands, so they were looking broadly across lands.
2:58:26
I know that internationally, it's had maybe more impact, that it is possible.
2:58:31
It's
2:58:36
hard to separate FEMAT from the science in FEMAT, so you put this
2:58:43
information together in a report.
2:58:45
It's also out in the scientific literature.
2:58:47
Right?
2:58:48
So, people have been building on that.
2:58:51
And I think that people look at forests differently.
2:58:55
But this “daylighted” a lot of the science for people and
2:59:00
policy-makers, in particular.
2:59:03
I know, in the international community and here, this interplay between
2:59:09
science and policy has been a subject of a lot of thinking and discussion.
2:59:18
What is the role of science?
2:59:20
What is the role of land management?
2:59:27
What were Forest Service, BLM, even Fish and Wildlife, interactions, before,
2:59:34
during, and how did the whole process from the beginning of the Forest Wars
2:59:39
through the big events affect things afterwards in terms of collaboration
2:59:44
and interagency dynamics, in general?
2:59:47
Well, there was effort when everybody was in
2:59:54
the Pink Tower, those were a lot of different federal agencies,
2:59:56
the ones that you just mentioned.
2:59:57
I didn't really get to that when we were talking, as we were focusing
3:00:00
on what you were saying, so I want to make sure I didn't forget that.
3:00:06
Afterwards, there was a Regional Ecosystem Office set up with the
3:00:11
goal of keeping us working together more closely as federal agencies.
3:00:16
That continues today, as our PNW Station Director serves on
3:00:20
committees of federal executives.
3:00:23
Today, executives are getting together to talk about the Northwest Forest
3:00:27
Plan synthesis and bio-assessment.
3:00:31
I really wasn't at a level where I knew quite what was going on.
3:00:36
It was like pre-FEMAT, but I can tell you, I watched it improve.
3:00:43
It's very noteworthy, how closely we worked together, and I know my
3:00:49
counterparts in the other agencies.
3:00:53
Were
3:00:59
Native American communities’
3:01:04
interests properly addressed?
3:01:06
If not, was there not the time to do it, and, if so, how has that
3:01:11
been addressed after-the-fact in terms of their interests?
3:01:14
There have been publications and studies on how this has affected
3:01:18
their lands and resources, but maybe you can fill in a few blanks on
3:01:24
that?
3:01:24
I would say it wasn't addressed sufficiently at the time.
3:01:31
There's efforts now to
3:01:35
better consider the American Indian tribes as sovereign nations.
3:01:42
It's not just a matter of the land practices,
3:01:49
but sovereign rights, and we're making progress on that.
3:01:59
What lands would have been most affected by the whole dynamic
3:02:03
with the Northwest Forest Plan?
3:02:06
Obviously, there are sovereign lands, but still, there's
3:02:08
watersheds and the relationships among them and things like that.
3:02:12
Yeah, right.
3:02:12
I mean, can you think of a couple examples of tribes that would be more affected
3:02:17
by what happened in the [Northwest] Forest Plan, whether it's because of
3:02:21
hydrological dynamics, or what have you?
3:02:25
Well, for many of the tribes their first foods come from the
3:02:33
rivers, the Columbia River Basin.
3:02:34
Right.
3:02:36
Large streams play a big, important role.
3:02:40
FEMAT really did try to address that.
3:02:44
There are so many factors that come into play with fish populations, but I think
3:02:53
American Indians have a
3:02:58
great deal of interest and a lot at stake with “first foods” [traditional
3:03:09
foods/diet/nutrition] . The national forests are where they are derived from.
3:03:14
This effort with the science synthesis
3:03:23
addressed that a bit more than in the past.
3:03:37
I think we've become a lot more cognizant of the importance of first
3:03:42
foods and culture, and just recognizing the rights of certain tribes.
3:03:50
It's very complicated.
3:03:51
You asked me a particular tribe, but there are so many and
3:03:54
they're all a little bit unique.
3:04:00
Well, every tribe is quite different, as they will be the first to tell you.
3:04:05
Yeah.
3:04:09
Do they have lands or land holdings?
3:04:12
Are those lands adjacent to national forests?
3:04:14
Are they downstream from national forests?
3:04:17
Do they have hunting rights?
3:04:18
There are some tribes that have
3:04:24
rights associated with timber harvest.
3:04:26
So,
3:04:29
I know that some of them really did have a presence when,
3:04:38
at the President's Summit, when he put together the conference.
3:04:41
There were some tribal leaders at that conference.
3:04:48
You're talking about at the Clinton Summit?
3:04:50
Yes.
3:04:51
Okay, so there was tribal representation there.
3:04:55
But there wasn't at the FEMAT, or was there some?
3:05:01
I just don't recall that.
3:05:05
Yeah, and I'm not sure.
3:05:06
I haven't gotten a clear picture of that yet.
3:05:07
I'm not just sure because there were
3:05:10
a lot of people in the building.
3:05:18
What has surprised you or your colleagues, from what you know about
3:05:24
monitoring, reviews, and evidence since the forest plan was implemented?
3:05:30
And you're coming up on the synthesis thing.
3:05:33
What has surprised you?
3:05:35
Oh, surprised me since in terms of?
3:05:37
The recovery of the lands?
3:05:39
Just anything that is affected out there.
3:05:50
Well, I used to fly over and look down and see a lot of fragmentation.
3:05:59
And I do see across the landscape
3:06:04
things being less fragmented.
3:06:07
I don't know if I would have thought that would happen in twenty years.
3:06:10
In other words, the infill of succession.
3:06:14
Yes.
3:06:15
Making the “overhead geography map” more green again?
3:06:20
More green, yes.
3:06:25
Then when you drive about and look at the forests, it's
3:06:37
just amazing how they went, so quickly, the forest has been growing back.
3:06:49
What is for you the most important?
3:06:53
Well, part of that is, it's not just there's a lack of cutting and
3:06:57
clear-cutting, but the use of different kinds of silvicultural systems resulting
3:07:05
in a rather quick change across the landscape, so using variable thinning.
3:07:15
Actually, that's another piece that the station really started to do, trying
3:07:20
to look at silvicultural systems to
3:07:24
more quickly bring old-growth characteristics on the land.
3:07:34
A lot of that's happening on state lands.
3:07:37
It's not just the federal lands, but state lands were also influenced
3:07:41
by what the science was on FEMAT, how they managed their lands.
3:07:47
Extending off something I didn't follow up on when we talked about the BLM,
3:07:51
Fish and Wildlife, and other agencies,
3:07:59
what has been the relationships since this time with the Oregon State Board
3:08:04
of Forestry or Oregon forest lands?
3:08:06
Same question for Washington.
3:08:09
I mean, they're different states, they've got different dynamics.
3:08:16
There are different lands, but how has it affected the dialogue
3:08:19
over forestry in general?
3:08:22
Oh, I don't know.
3:08:24
I don't know.
3:08:26
You've got the thing about the O&C lands and this stuff going on, but it
3:08:32
still changed the tenor of everything, and also changed the supply and demand
3:08:36
scarcity dynamic regarding the resource.
3:08:39
It's affected the whole.
3:08:41
It has affected all of the lands.
3:08:43
I guess, that was point about flying over.
3:08:45
Right.
3:08:45
I realized that this effort probably affected all lands.
3:08:49
Now, unintended consequences, probably Richard [Haynes] could have
3:08:54
predicted this, but there was a quick cutoff of private lands afterwards.
3:08:59
And then, that actually created huge inventories in mills, and the price of
3:09:05
timber, which first went up, went down.
3:09:08
And so, if you were a small woodland owner who was banking on retiring because
3:09:13
you were going to cut some timber, you may have decided to cut that much sooner
3:09:17
than you would have, because there was a sense, there was a fear that this was
3:09:23
going to happen on private lands, as well.
3:09:25
And so, there was a quick-cut effort.
3:09:27
They were afraid because there was the big government phobia kind of
3:09:31
thing, that big government was going to come and, it's not going to be your
3:09:35
guns, it's going to be your trees.
3:09:37
Yeah, I think there was some of that.
3:09:45
If you look at land cover, there were shifts, major shifts, because of this
3:09:49
across all lands, whether it was private, state, federal, small woodland owners.
3:09:54
That surprised me, I didn't see that coming.
3:10:01
Now, twenty years later now, in retrospect, the original plan, what
3:10:07
do you think were its strongest components and what do you think
3:10:10
were its weakest components?
3:10:11
Of the plan?
3:10:12
Yeah.
3:10:13
I can't really comment on the current implementation of the plan.
3:10:18
In thinking over the past decades, a weak component would be the Adaptive
3:10:21
Management Areas and adaptive management in general, which were both never fully
3:10:23
implemented, and that is unfortunate.
3:10:25
It's a great conceptual idea.
3:10:28
It's a great idea.
3:10:29
Yeah.
3:10:30
And it isn't a dead idea.
3:10:34
There's an interesting thing, I told George Stankey this, there's always
3:10:37
interest in it in all the publications we've done on adaptive management.
3:10:40
The strength [in NWFP] I think
3:10:46
was the protection of old-growth forests.
3:10:52
What is the most important value of an old-growth forest to you?
3:10:57
I can tell
3:11:04
you personally, the value of an old-growth forest.
3:11:07
Yeah, for you, what is the most important value or values, plural?
3:11:12
When
3:11:18
I go into an old forest, I get a different sense of time and of my place
3:11:25
in the world, and how ephemeral life is.
3:11:28
You have these big trees that are, 400 or 500 years old.
3:11:39
There is a reason why cathedrals were built the way they are, to mimic forests.
3:11:46
There's something spiritual about that, to be in a forest,
3:11:51
and the life all around you.
3:11:58
I think also,
3:12:04
just to be among big, big trees, and to be a small person, gives you a sense of
3:12:14
your place in the world.
3:12:17
There's nothing like going into a forest, an old forest, for solitude and solace.
3:12:28
From my standpoint, there is an ethical, a moral dimension.
3:12:35
As a civil servant, there are ethics related to making sure that people
3:12:42
in the future get to experience that.
3:12:47
That's part of
3:12:50
why I've come to
3:12:54
have spent all this time in this career.
3:12:59
That's one piece, but I guess there's a lot more.
3:13:02
But what a unique thing that this Northwest, that Oregon and Washington,
3:13:07
and California, have in these old forests.
3:13:12
It’s just amazing.
3:13:14
What if they had been lost for all time?
3:13:19
Motivations for American conservationism
3:13:27
can be found in George Perkins Marsh’s Man and Nature, a study of environmental
3:13:29
degradation in the ancient world.
3:13:29
Right.
3:13:32
He described the Mediterranean, Eastern European, and Western
3:13:36
Asian ecologies as having been denuded by thousands of years of
3:13:46
over-use, to a point where none of the great forests were left.
3:13:52
Regional economies and societies were negatively impacted by that.
3:13:57
That book [pub.] had an enormous impact on Americans at the time when it was in
3:14:03
the last throes of the Civil War, would soon experience the cut-and-run logging in
3:14:16
the Upper Midwest.
3:14:17
And then you could read Thoreau or Cullen Bryant's poems on the prairies
3:14:22
or the forests, or you read Emerson's Meditations on Nature, John Muir's
3:14:30
works, who often referred to them as the cathedrals.
3:14:32
Right.
3:14:32
And you would see that.
3:14:35
It's always a mix between utilitarian and economic survival aspects, and
3:14:40
the spiritual and emotional ones.
3:14:42
I think it's a balance.
3:14:44
Yeah, it's a balance perhaps.
3:14:47
Another interesting thing that's happening is we're doing a lot of
3:14:51
research on human health and nature.
3:14:54
And speaking utilitarian, I suppose, if you look at humans in
3:15:01
terms of spirit, but also health, this is influenced by spiritual
3:15:10
considerations.
3:15:12
Interestingly, I was just talking to someone from PSU [Portland
3:15:14
State University] who is looking at air pollution, forests
3:15:19
and tall trees, and the role of really tall trees in catching contaminants
3:15:29
and holding them above a city so that they don't fall on people.
3:15:35
They're pursuing that scientifically.
3:15:36
That was a surprising thing somebody just told me that I had never heard of before.
3:15:48
Pandora; did you see Avatar?
3:15:50
Oh, yeah.
3:15:52
The big tree?
3:15:54
[Laughs]
3:15:55
Yeah, I don't know.
3:15:57
But yeah, we are finding more and more that nature plays a role in human health.
3:16:09
If you go in hospitals now, they have pictures of trees and forests and nature.
3:16:13
They have windows.
3:16:13
So,
3:16:16
there is a whole sort of medical field with a whole lot of interest in forests.
3:16:27
You talked about a negative example of a local economy, I think it
3:16:33
was up in Washington, that 98 percent -- the Wind River area, right?
3:16:41
Skamania County [South-Cent.
3:16:41
Wash.] is 98 percent federal lands.
3:16:42
What's an example or two of a society that has adapted and proved more resilient
3:16:49
in the Northwest Forest Plan area?
3:16:52
I can think of some.
3:16:55
More did well than didn't.
3:16:59
I think
3:17:03
of Ashland and that area, including Medford, as kind of a mixed bag.
3:17:11
But places did well where they had a little more diversity in their economy.
3:17:18
There also seems to be something on some of the initial science we
3:17:22
looked at, leadership in towns, and
3:17:28
whether they had strong people that would come together and
3:17:35
that try to help diversify
3:17:39
the economy or take a look at alternatives.
3:17:42
I think there would also be a critical mass aspect, like you're
3:17:45
talking about Ashland and Medford.
3:17:47
There's a pretty large urban area, to be able to retrofit and retrain, and
3:17:54
there's even schools and stuff like that.
3:17:55
Schools, yeah.
3:17:55
The places that are truly rural, especially that do not have a sexy tourist
3:18:03
aesthetic component to it, struggle.
3:18:05
The McKenzie River Valley, for instance, well, everybody wants
3:18:08
to go up to the Three Sisters.
3:18:09
But, it's quickly becoming a different kind of economy.
3:18:14
It may not be what it used to be, but it's still a strong economy on its own level.
3:18:19
A lot of that would happen regardless of what happened.
3:18:23
But if you have somewhere like Skamania County, which just does not have a tax
3:18:26
base, it's just so sparsely populated.
3:18:29
And the southern Oregon counties.
3:18:33
Is Jackson County on there?
3:18:34
Yeah.
3:18:35
They're having horrible problems.
3:18:37
They don't even have a jail in, or is it Curry County,
3:18:40
that doesn't even have a jail?
3:18:42
Yeah.
3:18:42
Or something ridiculous like that.
3:18:43
Yeah, some of the counties are going to lay off their law enforcement.
3:18:46
That
3:18:49
is serious.
3:18:58
Can you talk about any experiences during this whole process
3:19:01
that we haven't talked about,
3:19:05
or people that you would like to highlight?
3:19:08
I wanted to ask you about Jack Ward Thomas, for instance,
3:19:11
you met him early on.
3:19:13
He led this through.
3:19:14
In fact, why don't you talk about him first?
3:19:17
Well,
3:19:20
just to say that he was the right person at the right time.
3:19:25
And he, as I said, he did have a forestry background.
3:19:32
He understood how to bridge the
3:19:38
gap between -ologists and the forestry folks, and he had a very strong
3:19:42
understanding of the dynamic nature of
3:19:49
the Forest Service and what was happening with the institution.
3:19:53
And he also just had leadership qualities that really helped
3:20:02
bring people together, and
3:20:07
he could communicate with the political folks and communicate with the scientists.
3:20:09
And he also had a big personality from what I hear.
3:20:13
He was charismatic.
3:20:14
Yeah.
3:20:16
You know, you don't see that so often.
3:20:19
But both he and Jerry Franklin, I would say, were very charismatic personalities.
3:20:26
And talk about Jerry now, too.
3:20:30
I would say, more than anybody, it was his science and ideas that would
3:20:34
have been the intellectual driving force behind a good portion of that
3:20:39
[NWFP] . Would you say that's correct?
3:20:41
Right, right.
3:20:41
And you know, Jerry's career started with the PNW Research Station.
3:20:45
If you go back into these photo files, you'll see during the '50s, he was walking
3:20:50
all over these forests and taking photos.
3:20:55
So, he literally understood these forests.
3:20:58
You know, he grew up, I believe, in--
3:21:06
Camas.
3:21:06
[Washington, east of Vancouver, North side Columbia River]
3:21:06
In Camas.
3:21:06
While he was doing that, he was looking at the ecology and
3:21:10
learning to understand the forests.
3:21:12
By the time FEMAT came along, he'd had a career in the Forest Service, a career
3:21:20
at OSU, he had worked and then he had gone up to the University of Washington.
3:21:24
So, he also knew a lot of people.
3:21:26
And he knew how--
3:21:27
And he also knew Washington.
3:21:29
Yeah, the University of Washington is where.
3:21:30
No, Washington, D.C.
3:21:32
Oh, and he was very much--
3:21:34
Because he went back to work at the National Science Foundation office.
3:21:39
He also was very politically connected,
3:21:45
even more than Jack, much more so, I believe.
3:21:48
And Jack was pretty connected, too.
3:21:58
They were the elder statesmen, both of them.
3:22:06
The younger folks,
3:22:09
the generation below them were Jim Sedell and Marty Raphael and Gordie Reeves,
3:22:19
and so on.
3:22:22
But they had studied or worked with them.
3:22:23
Tom Spies, I believe, really was a protégé of Jerry Franklin.
3:22:29
The same with Fred Swanson.
3:22:32
Fred Swanson had worked side-by-side with Jerry Franklin.
3:22:38
Well, an analogy to Jerry would be like if you look at great coaches
3:22:44
in sports, and they will often be—
3:22:47
[End Audio, Part]
3:22:47
[Start Audio, Part]
3:22:47
--trainers for a generation of coaches [after break in digital file]
3:22:48
. Right.
3:22:50
You look at coaching trees, like in college football or what-have-you,
3:22:53
and you can almost always see three or four origins for a lot of them.
3:22:58
For a lot of people.
3:22:59
Yeah.
3:22:59
I mean, it has to do with brilliance, inspiration, charisma, being
3:23:06
at the right place at the right time, a whole variety of things.
3:23:08
Yes, right.
3:23:11
So,
3:23:17
you have to understand that from where I was sitting, I was in a room of all men.
3:23:23
There were very few women.
3:23:26
I think there were maybe, in the social assessment team, [Margaret “Maggie]
3:23:31
” Shannon was brought in, and there were more women in the social assessment team.
3:23:37
And I know that was actually purposeful, that was recognized by Roger Clark.
3:23:43
So,
3:23:46
he made attempts to be sure that we had women rangers.
3:23:50
For instance, he brought in Renata McNair.
3:23:52
I know that was a bit on his mind.
3:23:56
That was not the case for things, generally.
3:24:00
If you look at Jack and Jerry; there were no women proteges.
3:24:06
There
3:24:08
were a few women, there's a fisheries biologist, I've forgotten her name [Kelly
3:24:12
Burnett] , but there were a few others.
3:24:13
But generally,
3:24:17
there was a lot of testosterone in the “Pink Building.” [Laughs]
3:24:25
A lot of guys.
3:24:25
This was what I was going to ask you, a follow-up on
3:24:32
that subject.
3:24:32
You've mentioned the experiences you had when you were younger, and when you were,
3:24:38
still early career, but more mid-early, when you dealt with the Pink Tower and
3:24:44
became, a “PNW lifer” from that point on.
3:24:48
Right.
3:24:48
What do you remember about that in terms of a lot of testosterone, but
3:24:53
being treated with respect, or not, and then how you've seen gender
3:24:59
dynamics evolve from that point on, independent of the Northwest Forest Plan?
3:25:03
You can talk about it in both contexts.
3:25:05
You know, I have always been treated with a lot of respect.
3:25:09
I always felt valued.
3:25:16
People extended friendship and
3:25:23
I really appreciated that.
3:25:25
I've actually felt that more in research than I did when I worked
3:25:30
in the National Forest System.
3:25:31
But the irony of that is that there are many more women in the National Forest
3:25:35
System than there are in research.
3:25:39
Really?
3:25:39
Interesting.
3:25:39
Gender diversity, I
3:25:45
believe has to do with networking and mentoring.
3:25:49
One of the first things I noticed when I came to the station, was that everyone
3:25:54
who worked at the H.J.A, had beards.
3:25:56
They all looked kind of alike.
3:25:56
At the
3:25:59
HJA?
3:25:59
[H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest]
3:26:00
At the H.J. Andrews.
3:26:01
Fred and Tom Spies had beards at the time.
3:26:02
Even Jim Sedell had a beard early-on.
3:26:05
Jim Sedell
3:26:08
and Mark Harmon.
3:26:10
You'd walk in to that forest and I'd go, "Whoa, I guess, you've got
3:26:13
to have a beard to work here." And
3:26:18
the other thing was height.
3:26:21
The agency actually truly thought that leaders needed to be tall.
3:26:25
That was actually written in, I've seen that in writing.
3:26:29
This was quite some time ago when this was the case, so everybody was tall.
3:26:32
Do you know that H.J. Andrews the man, was not tall?
3:26:32
And Jim Sedell was not tall, but
3:26:44
it seems
3:26:46
like these physical traits are a
3:26:54
factor, and I don't think it's a coincidence that people look alike.
3:26:58
And there was also no diversity whatsoever.
3:27:01
These are all white males.
3:27:05
And unfortunately, the racial dynamic is still a gigantic problem, in the Park
3:27:09
Service, the Forest Service, and the BLM.
3:27:12
There's been a lot of efforts to turn that around, but it's still very slow progress.
3:27:19
I also think that being an editor, being in communications, it was
3:27:24
very clear to me that this was safe ground for me to have a career in.
3:27:28
I was not competing with these people.
3:27:31
It's very competitive.
3:27:32
Scientists can be very competitive.
3:27:35
I was never deemed a competitor.
3:27:38
And I've seen women that are trying to have science careers.
3:27:45
That's a little different situation.
3:27:47
But even down at the Forest Sciences Lab where I work in Corvallis, a lot of
3:27:51
the writer/editor personnel are women.
3:27:53
We're permitted.
3:27:54
I just read something that just seems spot-on.
3:27:57
Actually, I heard it on the radio, but a woman just wrote a book very recently
3:28:01
about why there’s disparity in gender.
3:28:08
I think she's a social scientist, I'm not sure, or a gender studies person, but
3:28:15
men give permission to have careers.
3:28:19
And not as individuals, but collectively.
3:28:22
They will make room, and they are making room.
3:28:26
She's in academia at a university, so she was talking about that, and hi-tech.
3:28:31
There are these places where it's very hard for women to get toe-holds.
3:28:36
But you're seeing more women lawyers, more women doctors.
3:28:39
In the National Forest System, there are lots of women.
3:28:45
It's kind of interesting, and this is all in terms of pay.
3:28:55
The study was looking at the gender gap related to pay,
3:28:59
getting equal pay for equal work.
3:29:02
And that's still a problem.
3:29:04
That's still a problem.
3:29:06
And I think that was her point, that higher paying jobs are still held by men.
3:29:14
Women are probably getting more into the medium kind of jobs.
3:29:18
I say part of that is the lag effect of history and
3:29:20
generational building over time.
3:29:23
Part of it has to do with discrimination.
3:29:25
It's a little of both.
3:29:26
Well, and I don't think anyone sets out to be discriminatory.
3:29:31
I think women, within
3:29:38
my realm, I never feel like someone is going to keep women out.
3:29:44
I don't think any, really.
3:29:46
But, I think it really is very subtle, and they don't know, people don't know it.
3:29:52
They don't realize it.
3:29:53
They gravitate to people that look like them.
3:29:55
That would be my conclusion.
3:29:57
And also, where it feels safe, too.
3:29:59
Oh, absolutely.
3:30:00
Absolutely.
3:30:00
And you were talking about that, as well.
3:30:02
Yeah.
3:30:04
How would you rank the Northwest Forest Plan in terms of your career,
3:30:12
the original experience of going through the planning process, its
3:30:17
aftermath, and just dealing with communications over all these things?
3:30:23
Well, I have to make the distinction that I was part of the Forest Ecosystem
3:30:27
Management and Assessment Team, so I really wasn't involved with the plan
3:30:31
itself, just the science behind the plan.
3:30:34
But you were still a part of it.
3:30:39
The actual implementation of the plan has not shaped my career,
3:30:48
but the intersection of forest planning and science has
3:30:52
very much shaped my career.
3:30:53
Since my involvement with FEMAT, I've seen the science and management
3:30:57
communities deal with this interface as they realized the uses of science
3:31:21
for management.
3:31:22
This is particularly challenging when social issues
3:31:33
form lenses for looking at how
3:31:36
the world works.
3:31:37
In such situations, it is not always appreciated that scientific methodologies
3:31:37
were designed with the purpose of helping people make sound plans and/or take
3:31:55
certain actions.
3:31:55
Something that interests me is how people with different political views come
3:32:02
at complex issues from different places.
3:32:05
Although they have subjective interests and views, together they
3:32:08
can look at a set of data and agree on the best available science and
3:32:18
consider it in decision-making.
3:32:19
It was
3:32:27
a privilege to be part of the FEMAT process early in my career with the
3:32:33
PNW Station, as it shaped this notion that we have something to offer as
3:32:43
a research organization.
3:32:46
People have opinions, feelings, and points-of-view, but if you can
3:32:56
bring into “the room” information based on scientific methods on
3:33:10
which they can agree upon as sound; including good data
3:33:16
and hypothesis testing, and work that can withstand peer review, critical
3:33:19
analysis and replication, then you have something very valuable.
3:33:24
This scientific interface with management and policy is an onerous
3:33:26
process, but when you take knowledge from now, that has been building for
3:33:30
decades or centuries, this accrued
3:33:37
information, the value of
3:33:41
which really came to light during the Northwest Forest Plan
3:33:46
process, and continues today.
3:33:48
I think there was some naivete in thinking this could drive
3:33:53
the whole “kit and caboodle” but
3:34:00
the lessons learned overall were good.
3:34:00
In other words, that it was a “silver bullet” thinking of some kind?
3:34:02
That it was a silver bullet.
3:34:03
Right.
3:34:05
We all know it's not a silver bullet, but does that
3:34:12
diminishes its value?
3:34:13
No.
3:34:17
It drives things that make human beings have a much better life
3:34:23
than we did a couple centuries ago.
3:34:26
Our children live longer.
3:34:28
Our women do not die in childbirth.
3:34:32
That's at the very human level, because of science.
3:34:37
In terms of forest management, which is not nearly as dramatic, but it is for
3:34:42
some people, these forests mean that much to people for various reasons.
3:34:47
But, if we can all agree, based on science, that if we look into the future,
3:34:55
that different outcomes might occur for
3:34:59
people, and for the planet as a whole.
3:35:06
That was kind of an illumination with FEMAT, and
3:35:13
that experience, that notion, transcended my career.
3:35:18
That's a great answer.
3:35:19
It would have been the last answer, but during your answer, I realized
3:35:24
then that I have to ask one more question based on your job description.
3:35:30
Okay.
3:35:31
What do you do as Communications Director?
3:35:37
Just a second because I know that— [break in audio]
3:35:41
. Going back to the start of the question, and for the transcriptionist, you might
3:35:45
want to interrupt that half-phrase above.
3:35:49
Based on what you hear about the polarization of the United States and
3:35:58
societies in the West, and about the learned elite and science not adequately
3:36:04
communicating ideas or rationale to “the people,” and I extend that to forestry,
3:36:12
forest planning, and the Northwest Forest Plan, what strategy was used
3:36:18
to communicate its [NWFP] benefits,
3:36:25
what could have been done better, and what were examples of good
3:36:31
public outreach and communications?
3:36:32
In other words, how has that dynamic unfolded over twenty years, and
3:36:35
how have you sought to undertake communicating to everybody?
3:36:40
Right.
3:36:40
What we do here, and what this plan is and what forest management is and is
3:36:45
trying to do, I don't want to call it a big public relations campaign, because
3:36:49
that sounds like an intentional deception, but trying to communicate the “goods”
3:36:53
[qualities] of this to all the people.
3:36:53
I think since FEMAT, and at
3:36:59
that time,
3:37:03
it was very public,
3:37:07
people knew what was happening.
3:37:09
The reporters weren't in the room, but people were being interviewed, there
3:37:14
was national and international press.
3:37:16
But
3:37:21
I don't actually think there was much thought on planning
3:37:25
for that, and managing that.
3:37:27
There was some, but it was mostly done at quite a high level.
3:37:34
At that time, my job was not related to that.
3:37:50
Since then,
3:37:52
there has been a really big shift in terms of communicating about science.
3:37:56
Part of it is engaging people up front and helping them be more engaged and involved.
3:38:05
For instance, with the new science synthesis we're developing,
3:38:11
we actually put online the literature we were going to consider, and
3:38:18
then, invited people to add to that basis of scientific literature.
3:38:25
Now, this actually came out of the OMB -- Office of Management and Budget – which
3:38:32
has guidelines now for something called “Highly Influential Science.” So, I do
3:38:40
believe that FEMAT and other similar assessments led to this kind of direction.
3:38:51
The other piece is that we have an open peer-review process.
3:38:55
And people are starting to actually understand what peer review is.
3:38:58
I was thinking about this the other day because we were looking at a website and
3:39:02
trying to distinguish different kinds of publications, scientific publications,
3:39:07
peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed.
3:39:10
And I think that's actually becoming a little bit part of the vernacular now.
3:39:19
The new synthesis is actually being
3:39:24
reviewed now, the draft went out.
3:39:26
The draft that went to peer reviewers, was made public so that people could
3:39:32
give comments to the peer reviewers to consider as they do their review
3:39:36
and give information to the authors.
3:39:39
I think this would be in-line with concept of adaptive management.
3:39:45
In other words,
3:39:49
but doing this on the local levels, correct?
3:39:53
It could be at various levels.
3:39:55
Okay.
3:39:59
If we're talking federal lands, it's always local and national.
3:40:03
Right?
3:40:03
Right.
3:40:04
It's hard to say its level.
3:40:05
But adaptive management was about taking action, but it was also about
3:40:13
involving people from the beginning.
3:40:14
That's what I mean, but it was in the local context.
3:40:21
But at any rate, taking part in that learning process.
3:40:25
Now, the notion is
3:40:30
that various publics have an ability to
3:40:35
make sure that all science is being considered, because there has been since
3:40:39
FEMAT, kind of this notion that some people have some science over here, and
3:40:43
some people have some science over there, and that there's “dueling science.”
3:40:50
That has been a powerful concept, for better or worse.
3:41:00
I think
3:41:03
the ability for people to weigh in on different science literature
3:41:07
and provide their viewpoint on what is important literature and
3:41:13
give that to peer reviews, the peer reviewers then have to sort that out.
3:41:18
And all science is not equal.
3:41:22
Some has valid methodology.
3:41:24
And that's why the peer reviewers look at it.
3:41:28
At any rate, we are having to talk about this now.
3:41:30
We didn't have to talk about it before.
3:41:32
So, we're having to explain this and the actual scientific process.
3:41:38
We're being very, I guess the word would be transparent, about that; letting
3:41:43
people know ahead of time and giving them updates on what we're doing.
3:41:49
We had a public meeting where we had the peer reviewers listen to public comments.
3:42:01
This document [FEMAT] is pretty rough.
3:42:03
This did not go through an editor.
3:42:05
There is not much done with this thing.
3:42:07
This is pretty raw.
3:42:08
The next synthesis, twenty years later, it's going to be at least
3:42:14
this lengthy, likely two volumes.
3:42:16
There will be graphs and figures.
3:42:18
More polish.
3:42:20
Polish and just plain English, as we're going to try to make it more readable.
3:42:23
We have a science writer that's going to be going through it to make sure
3:42:28
it's understandable for the public.
3:42:30
So, we're really trying to make sure that we're not writing for other scientists.
3:42:36
We're not even writing for land managers, which is what we were doing
3:42:40
here, but we're writing for land managers, regulators, the public,
3:42:44
and specialists that work for NGOs.
3:42:47
You're probably going to have to be pretty interested to read it, nonetheless.
3:42:52
But our concept of who we're communicating with has changed.
3:42:56
And I think that FEMAT had something to do with that.
3:43:01
And you, as a person with a journalism background, understand
3:43:05
the difference between esoteric science writing and what the people
3:43:10
would read, whoever "the people" are?
3:43:12
Right, and we are also working on a short publication that we're struggling with
3:43:19
that, like a twelve-pager that we're going to try to encapsulate the science.
3:43:26
We're going to have executive summaries.
3:43:28
We're going to have a volume of executive summaries for each of the chapters.
3:43:32
For most people, that's all they would read.
3:43:35
Most anybody will want to read.
3:43:38
Sometimes that's all that I want to read.
3:43:40
[Laughs]
3:43:41
So, we're going to have various types of products, probably three main products.
3:43:47
But I'm exploring some other things too, plus, the opportunity to engage.
3:43:53
So many people want to engage with our scientists.
3:43:55
And of course, they did that after FEMAT.
3:43:57
All of the scientists were deluged where they could have not done a
3:44:02
drop of science for twenty years.
3:44:05
And just have talked to people.
3:44:06
To talk to people.
3:44:09
People that were at the end of career, like Jerry, although he worked much
3:44:13
longer after that, they could afford that.
3:44:16
But we had young scientists who really were needing to get published.
3:44:22
I'll just make the point that this is how science works.
3:44:26
You publish and you have your methodology, and you learn more, you learn from others,
3:44:31
and your expertise and stature grows.
3:44:34
Then you're asked to be a reviewer.
3:44:36
You review more and more.
3:44:38
Can you imagine how many publications, how many times, Jerry Franklin
3:44:42
had to turn down people who wanted him to be a peer reviewer?
3:44:46
So, it's a very social process, actually.
3:44:58
Yeah it is, you're right.
3:44:58
Sometimes it's a little bit difficult to be working in science at this point
3:45:02
in time, but you have these hopes.
3:45:04
One of my hopes is that by people will be understanding the process better,
3:45:12
and we also need to be more inspiring.
3:45:15
And I think, if anything, what
3:45:18
to note on FEMAT, was that we had inspired people.
3:45:24
People were inspired and they were inspiring.
3:45:26
And you know, I continue to think of inspiration coming from those people.
3:45:33
Jack Ward Thomas was a consummate communicator.
3:45:37
If I were going to have a communication workshop for my colleagues, I
3:45:41
would ask Jack to be there to talk about how you communicate science.
3:45:45
And then, if there were scientists who would tell me, oh, you shouldn't do
3:45:48
tech transfer or science communication, it takes away from your career.
3:45:53
I’m have them talk to Jack Ward Thomas or Jerry Franklin about that.
3:45:57
These people were incredible communicators, and Jerry continues to be.
3:46:02
Jim Sedell, one of the most inspiring people; he could get me and Gordie Reeves
3:46:10
and a whole variety of people to do something if he called us up and asked us.
3:46:15
I don't know how he did it, but I could never say no to Jim Sedell.
3:46:20
A lot of it, what he wanted to do, was because it was inspiring.
3:46:25
You know, it was about history.
3:46:26
It was about communicating better.
3:46:28
And he was such a champion of me, in terms of the products that I would come up with.
3:46:34
So, monthly science findings that he published, and became supported by
3:46:44
this, I had to have support from the station for these kinds of things.
3:46:47
And the people from FEMAT, they offered me support.
3:46:53
And I was able to talk with them really in-depth about different issues
3:47:01
that you deal with as a communicator.
3:47:05
We talked a lot about policy.
3:47:07
With Richard Haynes, a lot of conversation about what's the
3:47:11
interplay between science and policy.
3:47:14
And when, in these interviews, I keep getting this little twinge now because
3:47:21
I'm talking from my personal opinions, which is important as an individual to do.
3:47:29
As a scientist, what we have to offer is not opinions, so much as information
3:47:37
that people can trust, and information that's gone through the scientific
3:47:42
process and has been rigorously reviewed.
3:47:49
That's what we are, that's how we show up, that's why we show up to the table.
3:47:54
How do we protect the integrity of that and in communicating?
3:47:59
How do we assure that we maintain our reputations and integrity as scientists,
3:48:08
without having such a strong point-of-view that it starts to overshadow the
3:48:13
science and message as scientists.
3:48:17
I do a lot of counseling work with folks on that.
3:48:20
So, this interview has been somewhat uncomfortable for me, because I had
3:48:27
stepped across the line in terms of sharing, kind of personal information,
3:48:33
points-of-view and opinions.
3:48:36
But it's just that I'm not used to that, that's why it's not comfortable.
3:48:39
Well, I hope it's been cathartic, in a positive way.
3:48:44
Okay.
3:48:44
[Laughs]
3:48:44
But, anyway, that's a great last answer.
3:48:46
Thank you for going one step further with me, and I thank you very
3:48:49
much for a wonderful interview.
3:48:52
And say goodbye to the Pink Tower over there across the way, our set piece
3:48:56
as I described in one email to you.
3:48:58
Thank you very much, Cindy.
