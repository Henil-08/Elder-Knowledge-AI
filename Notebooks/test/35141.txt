00:04
2,3,4,5. Testing.
00:11
Testing, testing, 1,2,3.
00:18
Here we are at Jerry Franklin's cabin in the Wind River country
00:25
and the date is August 18, 2009.
00:31
I just failed to get the recorder recording for 45 minutes of
00:38
wonderful commentary by Jerry on his personal history.
00:44
I'll type up those notes, but we'll just proceed with the conversation.
00:52
I did want to go back and ask some more your history, you talked about
00:55
the influence of your father and your mother and your uncle, and
00:58
they both had been scout leaders.
01:00
You
01:03
said that your dad's scout leading was truncated by his work responsibilities,
01:12
I was just wondering a little bit about your mother and your father and
01:17
your uncle and what their work was.
01:19
You talked about your father being an outstanding example of the leadership
01:26
skill of listening and sensing the will and capacity of a group to move forward.
01:34
So how about just talking about their backgrounds and some of
01:38
their influences on you, including the nature of their work.
01:43
Sure, well,
01:47
basically most of the time when I was growing up, my dad
01:52
worked in the paper mill and
02:00
eventually he worked his way up as a foreman.
02:03
The
02:06
thing I remember most about my dad during my formative years was, first of all,
02:16
he was a laborer; he was a worker in
02:22
the paper mill and he worked shift work.
02:27
He basically rotated between days and swing shift and graveyard shifts;
02:34
and that was a very significant influence on our household.
02:40
Because it was changing essentially on a weekly or bi-weekly kind of basis.
02:49
But it was because of that that he was not able to continue to do the scout
02:59
leadership work that he had done.
03:02
My uncle on the other hand.
03:03
Let me just say this about my dad too, when I was born he and another
03:08
fella had a grocery store in Waldport, Oregon, and those were the depression
03:16
years and in the end they couldn't make
03:20
it.
03:21
He came back to Camus and
03:25
worked for a period of time driving a bakery truck; that was something he had
03:33
done right after he left high school.
03:40
Did he graduate from high school?
03:41
I don't think he did.
03:52
My uncle, on the other hand, was in the management part of the paper
03:59
mill and was the individual that was involved with a lot of the
04:05
scheduling processes of the activities.
04:09
The amount of pulp of different kinds that
04:13
was going to be necessary to operate the machines.
04:16
He
04:20
was one of those sorts of human computational, human computers that, you
04:27
know, have that incredible ability to
04:32
manage very complex, multi-dimensional kinds of systems, and for that reason he
04:38
was extremely valued by the paper mill.
04:42
Since he was in management, he was able to
04:48
carry on scout leadership activity and I ultimately was in his troop which
04:56
was Troop 312 which was associated with the Presbyterian church.
05:01
Each troop tended to be associated with some organization usually some church.
05:09
And he ultimately got the Silver Beaver [award] from the Scouts for a
05:14
lifetime of scout leadership activities.
05:30
My oldest son, actually, has that now.
05:34
We passed it on to him, he does a lot of
05:39
cub scout activities.
05:48
So, anyway, life was very, very difficult for a period of time there
05:53
till he got the job in the paper mill.
06:04
That probably got employment at the paper mill around 1940.
06:10
I am sure I could find a record of it, but the other thing was he didn't only
06:16
work shift work, but most of those formative years it was also WWII, and
06:27
he had to work a lot of extra hours during that time.
06:34
And another aspect of our living was that very distinctive was we couldn't afford
06:41
a car, so the family walked everywhere
06:49
pretty much.
06:52
Mom went shopping for groceries on foot with a basket with
06:59
wheels on it, and Dad walked to work.
07:04
It wasn't until right until the end of the war that they accumulated
07:08
enough money to afford a car.
07:12
And that was right when we started camping.
07:17
So how did camping fit into your engagement with forests?
07:25
Well that was really uh, that, really, I think locked in things
07:33
in terms of my love of the forest.
07:35
And the first year we went camping as a family we came to Government
07:41
Mineral Springs and we camped with my uncle and his family, and I just loved
07:50
it.
07:50
And, you know, I played cars amidst this big ole trees,
07:55
and I swung from vine maples.
07:59
Vine maples were like a jungle gym.
08:02
Then, the next year 1946, we went to La Wis Wis campground which is another
08:08
beautiful old-growth camp ground on the then Columbia National Forest.
08:13
And, then, the next year after that we camped at Longmire and Mount
08:17
Rainier National Park, and so I had a whole string of years and
08:23
uh it was at La Wis Wis that they
08:28
had a guard station there and somebody they were growing tree seedlings
08:33
in a cold frame; and it was a really at that time that I realized
08:42
at the first time, you know, you could make a career out this stuff!
08:47
And uh I think this was the first conscious time that I
08:51
said, "Hey, that would be cool."
08:54
So, how old were you at that point?
09:00
I was 8.
09:00
That right?
09:01
1946, no I was 9.
09:07
So, I was 8 when we went on our first big camping trip at Government Springs, and
09:13
I was 9 when I went to La Wis Wis. Then I started decided right then, you know
09:22
how kids start talking about what they're gonna do, and I remember talking with
09:27
my buddy Gary Betts about how I'm gonna go into forestry, and he said, "Ahhh,
09:35
no you're not," he said, "you're gonna be like the all rest of us and work in a
09:41
paper mill and work in a paper mill the rest our lives." Well neither of us did.
09:47
What did Gary Betts go do?
09:49
I don't remember what Gary Betts did.
09:52
He died young.
09:55
He died in his 40s I think.
09:59
Uh, but, you know, my friendship with him
10:07
turned out to be kind of a,
10:11
very
10:14
significant.
10:14
And not only because he was my best friend when I was 5 and 6 and 7.
10:23
But, also, he
10:26
didn't want to be my best friend anymore when I got along to
10:31
fourth and fifth and sixth grade.
10:33
He was much more popular; he was a really slick kid; he was a nice kid,
10:41
good looking and socially very adept, so I lost him as my best friend.
10:47
And the loss of his friendship was obviously a traumatic event for me.
10:59
I think it was significant.
11:03
In what ways?
11:06
Well, I think was maybe was one of my first experiences with loss.
11:12
And,
11:15
certainly, was part of my experience of being a social - not necessarily social
11:23
outcast - but, marginalized socially.
11:32
It was a number of really tough years for a kid growing up.
11:39
Which, in fact, lead me to do things pretty much solitary.
11:52
Well, that could lead off to another set of topics, but
12:01
one thing that was interesting during our walk yesterday was some of the
12:05
aspects of the progression of your sense of what you wanted to be when
12:11
you grew up; and you mentioned a few of them in this discussion, but
12:19
you mentioned others yesterday, so can you think back and sort of...?
12:23
Well, we talked about what sort of ambitions I had for myself
12:25
and I think you know that,
12:36
for me, maybe for a lot of people, you know, your ambition and
12:45
where you think you could go evolve over time, and for me, you know,
12:56
I think I was always relatively modest in terms of my expectations for myself,
13:04
because I wasn't sure of what I could do.
13:08
And I didn't ever like to set up goals for myself I didn't think I could achieve.
13:14
I didn't like to run at brick walls.
13:17
Anyways, so,
13:23
when I went into forestry I really didn't have any vision other than
13:30
maybe going to work for the Forest Service and becoming a ranger, maybe
13:37
it was about that sophisticated.
13:40
And then when I went into research, you know, there was one point in my career
13:45
where my assignment was actually upper slope forests; and I love the upper
13:53
slope forests; and, in fact, I was really glad that I had that assignment
13:59
rather than Douglas-fir, because everybody was working in Douglas-fir.
14:04
The alpine montane and sub-alpine was where the neat country was.
14:11
You said at one point you wanted to be the world authority...
14:14
I was absolutely, you know, going to become the world authority on the
14:21
alpine forests, various people have different names for it, but basically
14:21
the high elevation, true firs, spruce, hemlock forest and I worked at that
14:22
very aggressively and that was one of the reasons I went to Japan in
14:22
1966, which lead me to ultimately to go there for a year in 1970.
14:22
That was because Japan had a lot of sub-alpine forests
14:28
that
14:56
had
15:00
a lot of the same species that ours did.
15:03
And I could have maybe thought about the Himalayan or the Chinese, but the
15:08
Chinese was not accessible at that point and there really wasn't any opportunity
15:16
for me to get into the Himalayan.
15:19
So, anyways, certainly, in the early '60s that's where my focus was.
15:27
Why did you look to Asia rather than Europe?
15:32
Well,
15:36
I'm not sure what it all was.
15:38
I have always had a certain
15:45
distaste for Europe.
15:48
You know,
15:51
I can't really, I guess, I really can't explain why.
15:54
Certainly, one of the reasons I looked to Asia was that we had a lot more
15:59
affinities to Asia in terms of our floras
16:07
and the kinds of forests that were there.
16:10
Certainly, the sub-alpine forests of Asia are much more diverse than
16:21
Europe,
16:25
but I've also never really been attracted by the culture, the history of Europe.
16:36
Maybe some of it reflects, you know, the orientation that
16:47
came out of WWII, and, uh, I don't know.
16:54
Anyways, it turned out to be a good choice, because the majority
17:00
of the academics that I was associated with, like Dick Waring,
17:05
chose Europe as the place to go.
17:09
And again, you know, it's a little bit like avoiding
17:15
Douglas-fir, go to some area where
17:22
there aren't a lot of people going on, less competition, maybe
17:30
there's
17:32
more to be creamed off, maybe it's just a better opportunity.
17:40
I don't know what all of the psychology of it was.
17:47
It was explicit.
17:53
This relates to
17:58
some things I've wondering about
18:04
and that has to do with East Coast U.S culture and European
18:10
culture and that relates
18:16
to questions to key points in your personal history when you left Corvallis.
18:26
You went to Harvard Forest for a year
18:31
and you seemed to know that you were at a key juncture in your
18:34
personal life and your professional life where you were probably
18:39
going to leave the Forest Service.
18:43
One impression that I had was that you were shopping around on the East Coast.
18:50
And,
18:53
you know, there are the Ivy's [Ivy League schools] and big name places back there.
19:00
And, I'm someone who did grow up in the east, but find myself
19:07
much more comfortable on the West [Coast] by temperament and
19:13
also attracted to think more across the Pacific from Tasmania all the way up
19:21
through Japan and China and Harbin [China]
19:31
. I can't articulate exactly what the feelings are, but I think
19:35
there are some things where
19:38
the nature of the academic traditions and sense of elitism expressed out of
19:46
the East Coast and European cultures; whereas just by the social lore, you
19:54
know, the Asians tend to be much more,
19:59
to honor us, perhaps excessively, as visitors - just out of the
20:05
way they conduct themselves regardless of us in standing
20:12
in their home ground or ours.
20:12
Anyway,
20:15
can you talk a bit about things you considered options at that time?
20:28
Yeah, there's a lot there to talk about.
20:32
Certainly, one of the things that drove me professionally, as I began to get
20:39
more and more engaged with the broader world - of the ecological world - was
20:46
an intense irritation of the way the western forests were ignored in
20:55
the development of ecological theory and
21:00
one
21:06
stimulus to my energy and aggressiveness was by having those people in the East
21:18
and in Europe take account of our forest.
21:23
We are not going to have any theory that does not accommodate what we see in our
21:30
forest, so there was a strong element of that at some point in my career.
21:37
But, absolutely, when I went to Harvard Forest I was thinking
21:43
about what I was going to do next.
21:46
I was thinking there was some prospect of
21:52
... I think they were looking for a dean at Duke University and I went down there,
21:59
I think, and visited, because I had some connection with Norm Christianson when
22:06
I went down there to the Osteen lecture.
22:09
Anyways, I was trying to decide whether or not I wanted to be a dean or not.
22:15
Did you interview there or was it more of re-con?
22:19
No, I don't think I did, I think it was just a rec-con.
22:23
And as I thought about it seriously, consciously for the first time I realized
22:30
that deans deal with money and personnel issues, and that was not likely to,
22:42
as I put it to myself, that isn't likely to make you smile
22:47
when you get up in the morning.
22:49
So,
22:52
I very clearly thought about that and I thought about things like assistant
22:56
director at stations [Forest Service Research Stations] or going into
22:59
Washington D.C. [office of the Forest Service] because I was getting a lot of
23:01
pressure from Bob Buckman [Associate Chief of the Forest Service for Research] to do
23:03
a cycle in the Washington office, so they could spin us out to a potential station
23:11
director position or something like that.
23:13
And both Jack Thomas and I simply told him were not going to do that, you want
23:17
to make us a station director that's fine.
23:20
I think either of us would have accepted that, but neither of us were about to go
23:26
through some sort of Washington office cycle in order to facilitate that.
23:31
Bob Buckman struck back in his own way by refusing to give us 16s [GS grade 16 - the
23:36
"super scientist" level] , but anyways.
23:39
So, no, in general, you're quite right [that] I had a prejudice
23:49
against the eastern establishment and a sense that they were sort of
23:53
the elite of ecological science,
23:58
and I was irritated by the fact that they didn't take account of our western forest.
24:09
But,
24:12
I think by the time I went to Harvard Forest I had sort of overcome that.
24:17
In fact, I had even thought about going east for a degree, I thought about
24:22
going to Duke, I thought about going to Yale, but, in the end, I didn't
24:29
want to leave the West to do that.
24:33
It is interesting that you have become personal, close friends
24:39
with Gene Likens who's probably
24:43
the eastern guru [of ecology] , and then you had a what looked to
24:49
me like wonderful collaboration with Richard Forman at Harvard.
24:56
So, these are guys who are in very different ways leaders back there.
25:03
So, it seems you caught the sense of the East; in spite of the institutions
25:10
having elitist characteristics to them, you really connected to individuals.
25:19
You know I had several possibilities.
25:23
You know, John Gordon, when he was dean of Yale said, you
25:26
know, we have a Chair [at Yale]
25:32
for you anytime you are prepared to take it.
25:39
And Gene Likens, when he was looking for
25:43
an associate at Cary [Institute, Millbrook, NY] , made it very clear that
25:51
he would be very pleased to have me there.
25:59
So, you know there were several possibilities I could have taken,
26:06
and I just realized that my history was all here on the West Coast
26:10
and I would give up way too much,
26:15
you know, ultimately,
26:23
I would not be able to do as much to make enough difference in the forest,
26:30
if I was, in fact, to go back there.
26:45
What was your thinking about going to the University of Washington.
26:52
That was quite interesting to me,
26:59
given the struggles during the IBP era between the Corvallis and the Seattle
27:06
camps, and you were a major wieldier of swords; and the same guys you had done
27:16
combat within the context with of IBP were still there and in power positons.
27:25
So, what was your thinking,
27:29
I take it to be some sort of balancing act, you know, wanting to stay with
27:33
your beloved big old forests of the Northwest and wanting a platform
27:44
to help the forests and uh you wanted to, you had a whole bunch of things
27:51
you were playing off there and getting far enough away from Corvallis and
27:57
the Andrews but not too far, you didn't carry any of the old baggage.
28:02
So, how'd you do that?
28:06
I don't know that
28:11
I really thought about it that much.
28:13
It
28:15
seemed to me the University of Washington seemed like a logical place to go.
28:22
Especially, because I had a lot of conflict with Dale Cole and
28:32
I think the previous year I had actually said something to perhaps the Dean who was
28:41
Thorud, or I think I actually said something to somebody that I was, in
28:46
fact, costing them a lot of money.
28:50
Because you know basically Corvallis had eaten their lunch in the Olympics
28:56
[National Park] , eaten their lunch in Mount Rainer [National Park] , it had
28:58
eaten their lunch in Mount St. Helens.
29:00
And, so, you know, our group at Corvallis had really moved into
29:05
territory that was rightfully in the domain of the University of Washington.
29:11
And I think I said something to them along the lines of you ought of just hire me.
29:20
There were a whole lot of factors that related to this too.
29:26
I was burned out, I had been working at Corvallis for ten years leading the group.
29:36
You know, basically, my
29:43
marital situation was in shambles and
29:49
I knew unconsciously, if not consciously, I had to end that and move on.
29:59
So, it was just an opportune time to do it, and it seemed
30:02
like an appropriate place.
30:04
So, when Thorud called me up and said we need a mid-career
30:12
forest ecosystem scientist and they say that you're the best,
30:18
it was kind of a no brainer.
30:20
But, as you know, I tried to use it as a leverage a change in status in Corvallis.
30:28
We went to Stoltenberg [dean of the College of Forestry at Oregon State
30:29
Univ.] and said I'd like to stay.
30:33
Stoltenberg couldn't have been happier to get rid of me, so there
30:38
was no prospect of staying there.
30:40
And, if I stayed, anyways it wouldn't have dealt with some of the personal issues.
30:48
So, anyways, it was just a circumstance that was
30:56
ideal.
30:56
And I didn't worry a whole lot about the fact that there was some people
31:01
there that were pretty angry at me.
31:04
Dale Cole was certainly one, Stan Gessel was another one, because
31:10
of my involvement with old-growth
31:17
forest.
31:17
[Cole and Gessel were senior faculty in soils and leaders of the UW IBP
31:17
program.] He became increasingly angry after I went up there.
31:20
I think if we'd been further along on the old-growth and all the crisis at
31:30
that time - '85 and '86
31:37
- it might not have happened, because there would have been some people
31:42
sufficiently angry at that point, that they would not have wanted me
31:49
there.
31:49
Stan became increasingly bitter about the environmental movement
32:01
after he had worked so hard for so long to increase the productivity
32:05
of the Northwestern forest.
32:07
So, anyway, it
32:11
just seemed to one of those situations where everything fell into place.
32:17
It was very logical.
32:19
I think the key was having gone to Harvard Forest and sort of
32:27
weakened some of the ties and gotten away for a while.
32:31
I
32:34
went by myself rather than taking Carol along and it was very clear to
32:41
me I lived a very different lifestyle when I was by myself than when I
32:46
was with her and that was certainly one of the goals I had in mind.
32:49
I wanted to know how I behaved when I was just on my own.
32:58
It
33:18
was almost monastic period.
33:31
Basically, everything came together and it was also a time I worked through
33:40
the issues the personal issues, and I really come out in very
33:49
different place than I was in for the first half of my career.
33:53
For the first twenty years of my life I'd
33:58
operated a lot from a position of inferiority, I was often a
34:03
pretty aggressive individual.
34:05
I was not confident; and
34:11
in the mid-life period I became very centered.
34:19
Basically,
34:34
I became much more self-affirming, not requiring strong reinforcement,
34:41
constant reinforcement from others about my adequacy.
34:47
So, anyways,
34:51
you look at it and say, oh my god, how could all of these
34:54
things come together in this way.
34:58
So, that was really transformative.
35:03
Stuff that was probably developing over time, but that break made it
35:11
look more like a step function?
35:13
Absolutely.
35:21
That was
35:24
time when
35:27
you busted your ass to have the Andrews Forest have a future.
35:35
And that was part of a test period to see if it could have
35:40
a future after Jerry Franklin.
35:42
So, you left [to see] if I and we could live on after you.
35:51
Actually, no, if there was some of that, it was unconscious, because
35:58
the group had matured.
36:00
And, you know, the perspective I had, I didn't have any doubts of the ability of
36:07
that group to carry on without me anymore.
36:09
In fact, my sense was, the time for my kind of leadership was over,
36:19
I'd been in many senses a benevolent dictator.
36:24
I pretty much ran things making decisions myself.
36:32
The group matured to a point where
36:36
they weren't going to let any individual make a decision.
36:39
It was more of a collective.
36:44
One
36:51
thing that intrigued
36:55
me.
36:55
Oh man, I've got so many questions!
36:57
[Chuckles] But, one of them is that you commented that deans don't
37:03
get up in the morning and smile.
37:05
I
37:07
remember being on pulses [team building field gathering he
37:09
organized] and you'd get up and yodel.
37:12
And, partly,
37:17
that's because
37:20
you've kept close to the forest.
37:25
You spend a lot of time in the forest.
37:31
That's happened throughout your career and, whether your teaching
37:35
or doing research or you're in your cabin, you're immersed in the forest.
37:45
I picture a lot of people, academics, Forest Service scientists getting
37:51
progressively more inside and
37:56
less in contact with the muse.
37:59
I think that's true.
38:01
But, you know, one of the other aspects of it is one of the reasons I'd get
38:06
up on a pulse and yodel is because
38:13
all of these people were people that had self-selected ourselves.
38:20
And these were people that I cared about and knew cared about me.
38:26
So, it wasn't the sort of thing were you're a dean and you
38:31
got to take what's out there.
38:35
So, I was out there with a bunch of people I enjoying being with and cared about.
38:42
And who were there voluntarily,
38:47
pretty much.
38:50
And I knew who cared about me and what we're doing.
38:54
So, that was in many ways a happy band.
39:01
You know, a band of brothers, so to speak.
39:08
So, that was another reason I could be happy.
39:13
I was grateful to
39:17
that group of people that I was with that they were willing to do this;
39:21
that they were willing to follow me.
39:27
Another thing about your career that is interesting and I think incredibly
39:35
important in terms of making possible some of the huge changes that have occurred
39:43
in management policy in this region and, therefore, a big chunk of the globe, was
39:49
that you had one foot in the ecology world
39:56
and one foot in the forestry world.
39:59
You were the president of the Ecological Society of America and
40:04
were given a major award of the Society of American Foresters.
40:09
These are very different cultures, different ways of doing business, and
40:16
then, when things come up, with things like the Forest Wars, people from the
40:22
two cultures tended to be on two sides.
40:28
And, yet, you had a foot in both camps.
40:32
How do you view that?
40:34
How do you think about that?
40:35
Is there design there, happenstance?
40:38
And how do you think of the impacts of that?
40:42
Well, it was where I was.
40:45
And,
40:48
so, you know, it's the place I chose to be.
40:51
And
40:56
the ecological side gave me a number of things.
41:02
It gave me
41:05
knowledge
41:08
and, certainly, you know,
41:13
there was the tendency toward being more environmentally oriented that
41:19
went with the ecological [side] and it was also where the source of money was
41:26
to do what I wanted to do.
41:30
And at the same time, my goal was to really do good for forests, so,
41:39
ultimately, that meant affecting forest
41:44
policy and practice.
41:47
So, it's just simply where I had to be.
41:50
And it had disadvantages and it still does!
41:56
In that your never fully accepted by either culture.
42:03
You got no mama you got no papa.
42:07
But given what I saw as my mission, it was the place I needed to be.
42:18
And I was very aware that's what it was, but we end up that same sort of
42:25
place today where the environmentalists know I won't carry their water for
42:32
them, and the timber people know I won't carry their water for them.
42:39
On the other hand, that's what gives you credibility in policy.
42:47
I think most people accept that
42:52
I'm really going to represent the interest of the forest
42:57
as I best understand it.
43:26
One thing I was curious about, as you moved into new arenas,
43:36
how do you view the triggers of transitions?
43:41
I remember, boy, must have been 20 years ago that I asked you to give a
43:45
talk on the 9 lives of Jerry Franklin
43:53
[retirement talk] . And I remember at that time you could not fit all the
43:59
major themes that were substantial into 9, and lots has happened since then.
44:11
So, anyways, I'm wondering how you
44:15
view
44:18
your personal history and the major themes that you've worked
44:21
on and how many were opportunities presented to you that you jumped on.
44:28
How many of these things you created sort of de novo?
44:32
I mean I'm thinking of things like Research Natural Areas and that whole
44:38
program and Mount St. Helens and old growth and canopy/crane research.
44:48
You know, pretty incredible portfolio that numbers a dozen or two where
44:56
most of mortals feel really great if we have three or four in our career.
45:06
[Chuckles]
45:06
Well,
45:10
part of that had to do with opportunities.
45:13
Part of it had to do with escalating vision with what could be done.
45:19
You know I've always tended to opt
45:25
where I can have the most impact.
45:28
So those are typically where I'll make the decisions.
45:33
But those decisions usually reflect an opportunity that comes on.
45:39
You know, the Natural Areas thing, I dearly loved working on Natural Areas and
45:44
that was an era, particularly in the '60s,
45:50
where I didn't think we were ever going to set aside any large areas.
45:58
The large set asides at that time were wilderness, and I
46:05
couldn't influence that process.
46:08
But, something I could do was really work hard to get some postage
46:17
size samples of the ecosystem set aside, and there were a lot of
46:27
other things you could accomplished at the same time by doing that in
46:32
terms of research opportunities.
46:35
So that's what I did.
46:38
First, it started with just proposing a few Natural Areas, and then, working with
46:45
the Northwest Natural Areas Committee, I realized there was an opportunity
46:50
to do this more broadly and one of the keys was that we needed to have a plan!
46:55
So that we didn't need to, every time we proposed a natural area, argue again the
47:01
whole case, well why do you need this one?
47:05
We needed a plan that laid it all out to say this one is to meet this need.
47:12
In a matter of about a decade we were able to meet that point.
47:23
And everybody accepts it, amazing!
47:26
This is too easy; I can't believe it!
47:28
You know you laid it out in a very logical fashion and the agencies and scientific
47:38
community was prepared to accept it.
47:43
And, you knew, I knew at the time that these were interim kinds of achievement.
47:46
You said that these are interim
48:56
effort and I wonder what you mean by that?
48:59
Well, by that I mean the plan isn't forever.
49:03
And that basically, at some point in time
49:09
your...if the environment, the social environment, policy
49:17
environment continues to be sympathetic to this kind of thing, you'll revise
49:23
it and probably enrich it more, but
49:30
basically, hey, we got a plan now and other people can go from here.
49:39
By that time, I was really into the ecosystem stuff,
49:44
IBP, I was well into that,
49:49
and I was actually with National Science Foundation by that time.
49:58
That was sort of ok, that's done and I'm going to move onto something else.
50:02
Other people can do this now.
50:08
My worldviews and ambitions had escalated.
50:17
We're going to do this old-growth stuff.
50:20
And
50:25
then congruent with that the opportunity was to really build
50:30
the Andrews as a field station.
50:38
What was the date on that?
50:40
Well, what I'm taking you know.
50:43
We finished the plan for the RNA's [Research Natural Areas] in
50:51
about 1974, something like that.
50:57
Basically, I remember Ted Dyrness [Forest Service Research soil scientist]
51:02
and Glanda Faxon [administrative assistant] coming back or me coming here.
51:08
Anyway, we got together some place and did the finishing touches on the plan.
51:14
Like on so many things, Ted ended up cleaning up the loose ends on things.
51:27
So, that work had really been completed 1971 or 1972, so it was really just about
51:36
tying a ribbon it.
51:39
I'm interested in the general phenomenon and part of your M.O.
51:48
[method of operation] which is to
51:51
pass things on.
51:54
And
51:59
I was wondering if you could comment on that.
52:01
How conscious is that?
52:03
In this case, it seems like it was quite conscious.
52:06
And it seems like there are a couple of elements of doing that, at least
52:13
looking back at how you've done it.
52:16
You're cultivating a project, a program, an experiment, like log decomp.
52:21
[the 200-year log decomposition experiment implemented by Mark Harmon in 1985] , and
52:24
cultivating an individual, a community, such as the RNA's to do the carry-on work.
52:35
It's not just build it and they will come.
52:36
You've got to do some of the building it with some people who
52:41
will help be the carry-on people.
52:44
So, how do you view that?
52:46
Well, I think it has to do, again, in a way with, putting my time, my effort
52:54
where I can have the greatest impact.
52:57
And,
53:03
basically, there are a whole bunch of elements to that.
53:06
I also don't feel I'm the best scientist in the world.
53:10
But I know I'm good at opening up new possibilities, creating
53:18
new opportunities for things.
53:20
And, so,
53:25
I haven't
53:28
thought a whole lot about it, because I just assumed that
53:34
when you open up a new horizon,
53:40
that, you know, there are going to be folks coming along that
53:45
will be prepared to participate
53:51
and ultimately take the leadership in those areas.
53:56
And, so, you know in a sense what you see is a progression of
54:04
horizons and
54:13
there not just single, it's not like there [are things]
54:16
all lined up in a progression.
54:21
In fact, they tend to proliferate, to become branches.
54:31
Well they do or they don't.
54:34
In the case of the
54:40
RNAs, that's sort of an uphill battle because it isn't a really
54:43
well-funded program, but you
54:47
had Sarah [Greene, Forest Service ecologist in charge of RNA for many
54:49
years] . She was really a flag carrier and she had her friends and her
54:57
communities, which include TNC [The Nature Conservancy] and BLM and so forth.
55:03
So, the social network is really quite interesting.
55:09
And the significance of RNA's has of course shifted tremendously, because,
55:15
in the old days we could imagine them being these little postage
55:18
stamps in a sea of plantations, but now that's not the case anymore.
55:28
So, there's a community that continues to advocate, and
55:37
I think they have some challenges in what they do, but there
55:40
is action on much of them.
55:42
But then there are some other places where there hasn't been, as
55:46
far as I can see, the same kind of thing going, like the canopy crane.
55:53
That
55:56
doesn't have the...
56:00
No.
56:05
For me, it isn't the canopy crane, it's Wind River [Experimental Forest] . And,
56:11
so, if you look at what happened,
56:17
now I got involved there in the early 70s with ecosystem stuff, and we really
56:24
got great programs going and old-growth and natural forest and natural streams.
56:33
Once we
56:40
broke through and began to do that, the group did a tremendous job in the
56:47
post-IBP period and then the critical thing was to get the LTER [Long-Term
56:54
Ecological Research] , to make sure we got that, so that for the large
56:59
measure the future was assured.
57:04
And you had a critical mass of financial resources and of people to continue that
57:12
program, that's exactly what's happened.
57:16
So, NEON will be the LTER for Wind River?
57:21
[National Ecological Observatory Network]
57:21
Absolutely.
57:21
It's going to assure that that site will continue to be a significant
57:28
location for forest ecosystem research.
57:31
And maybe the [canopy] crane goes down tomorrow, well it isn't just about the
57:37
crane, it isn't just about canopy science.
57:42
It's about a place that's accumulating a body of scientific information, and
57:50
I've viewed it as being absolutely critical to have some other locations.
57:55
You know, I tried to argue this with Barbara Bond [OSU professor and
58:00
Principal Investigator of Andrews Forest LTER] ineffectively, you know, you
58:03
need multiple centers of the science.
58:12
We tried to create an alternative center to the science in the Olympic
58:16
Peninsula and that was a failure.
58:19
It still exists as a place, right?
58:23
The Olympic Natural Resources Center?
58:26
Yeah.
58:26
And it's cruising along, limping along, whatever the right verb is...[chuckles]
58:35
...with some earmark funding and a little bit more.
58:40
What is the shortcoming?
58:43
Why has that place not taken off and been self-sustaining and vibrant?
58:52
Well, because, of the community and the people in charge, basically.
59:06
The vision that I had for the Olympic Natural Resource Center was
59:10
a world class scientific institution.
59:15
And that's not the vision that the folks on the Olympic Peninsula had.
59:23
And, you know, they got control of it.
59:29
And,
59:33
there were a number of factors that contributed, but one of the things that
59:38
Thorud was determined that it was going to be a user-pays kind of facility.
59:44
Well, nobody can afford to use the facility.
59:53
So, in any case, it's strictly,
1:00:02
well it's nothing, but kind of a very local.
1:00:13
It has not achieved any kind of regional status, let alone national status.
1:00:18
Right, it's sort of interesting, there was sort of a period there
1:00:21
when centers were being defined.
1:00:25
Olympic National Resource Center, Blue Mountain Natural Resource Institute, and
1:00:33
the Andrews scene.
1:00:34
We called ourselves the Cascade Center for Ecosystem Management and
1:00:38
then that morphed into a learning center and a New Perspectives center
1:00:41
[short-lived Forest Service designations] and an Adaptive Management Area
1:00:47
[under the Northwest Forest Plan] and now, against my better judgment, we
1:00:49
call ourselves the Central Cascades Adaptive Management Partnership.
1:00:53
It's fascinating how the names keep changing, but at least at the
1:01:01
Andrews the core relationships and projects and so forth do move forward.
1:01:09
It sort of relates to some bigger issues about the inability of institutions
1:01:14
to stick with adaptive management.
1:01:18
Long-term studies that ends up being dominantly grassroots efforts, except
1:01:26
NSF's continued funding is critical.
1:01:31
There is an area that I'm curious about which isn't so much historical,
1:01:36
but hopefully someday we can view it from a historical perspective, and
1:01:41
that is connecting the cities with these wildland sites, and, so, now we
1:01:47
have Wind River incipiently in NEON
1:01:52
and Andrews for 29 years an LTER site.
1:01:59
And, can we connect them with Portland and Eugene, Springfield?
1:02:06
Especially, Portland probably, if it were to be an ULTRA or ULTRA-light.
1:02:14
[Urban Long-Term Research Area -a short-lived NSF/Forest Service funded
1:02:15
program] And there is good energy in Portland, whether it's successful in
1:02:20
ULTRA planning grant or ultimately if there are to be any ULTRA grants.
1:02:26
I'm curious what the connections can be between the cities
1:02:29
and these kinds of places.
1:02:32
How explicitly and publically known should the connections
1:02:39
be?
1:02:39
Ways that might lead to a lot more traffic of citizens into these kinds of places.
1:02:45
Or are the connections going to end up being more virtual and in the science
1:02:53
realm where there's, say, common big forest plots between the wildlands
1:02:58
and city sites, and we actually are extending our forest-dynamics thinking
1:03:04
of studies into urban parks settings where different, some different
1:03:08
kinds of things are occurring.
1:03:10
Both in the social realm of public learning and also ecologically,
1:03:16
you know, where you've got English ivy issues [invasive plants] and
1:03:19
simple forest or invaded forests in places like Forest Park in Portland.
1:03:25
Do you have any thoughts?
1:03:27
Not really, because I don't really have a passion for that.
1:03:40
I tend to only look at that from a couple of perspectives.
1:03:47
One is, what can that mean to the places I really care about like
1:03:54
the Wind River or the Andrews?
1:03:55
And,
1:03:59
from a strictly,
1:04:03
very standing-back, philosophical perspectives of understanding the need
1:04:11
for the urban communities to support their natural resources, I'm supportive
1:04:22
of that urban and wildland linkage to the degree it can improve, the
1:04:32
degree the urban populations relate to it.
1:04:37
But, I have no personal passions for it.
1:04:41
And there may not be any horizons left for me, in the sense
1:04:49
to go back to where we were.
1:04:51
I was talking about how
1:04:55
horizons have opened up, the
1:04:59
IBP, ecosystem science, the old-growth, big horizon opened up within LTER.
1:05:07
In terms of creating a context for a lot of people to do a lot of good
1:05:14
stuff on the systems that I love.
1:05:22
Obviously, the Northwest Forest plan was an incredible horizon that opened
1:05:26
up in terms of influencing policy, not so much providing for opportunity
1:05:33
for people to learn more about these systems, but very directly influencing
1:05:38
how they're going to be managed.
1:05:40
NEON is another example of opening up another horizon and always, for
1:05:48
me, the whole point of NEON was that, dammit, NEON was going to provide
1:05:58
some resources for my backyard.
1:06:03
And, you know, the only reason I hung in there with NEON was because
1:06:11
I wanted to do everything I could do make sure it was a distributed system.
1:06:19
You know these Northwestern forests profited very much from
1:06:24
our knowledge of this biome.
1:06:29
So, you know, in a sense, part of what I see in what I've done is, as my
1:06:37
opportunities have escalated in terms of creating an environment and context for
1:06:45
other people to work on these forests.
1:06:48
That was fine with me, it wasn't really critical that I did, what was
1:06:54
critical was to create the circumstances which would continue to expand our
1:07:03
scientific knowledge and improve our policy regarding these forests.
1:07:09
That's cool.
1:07:17
So,
1:07:20
is there any other forest biome
1:07:28
and, maybe biome isn't quite the right word,
1:07:34
that has
1:07:38
achieved a place
1:07:44
in the social consciousness that this Pacific Northwest conifer biome has?
1:07:51
You commented that a motivation for
1:07:54
you and
1:07:59
a perspective for you relative to Europe and Eastern U.S was well,
1:08:04
dammit, we're going to have the Western forest, the Northwest forest
1:08:10
have a place in ecological theory.
1:08:15
But, not only did it get to be a big player in ecological theory,
1:08:22
it seems like, it's hard to say because we're so immersed in it, but
1:08:31
how would you assess its place in public perceptions of forest.
1:08:36
One way to look for that might be to look at all the books that have been
1:08:40
written about forests in the last 20 years, and how many of them sort
1:08:49
of them came out of this setting?
1:08:52
And, granted a lot of them had to do with conflict, but it also had a hell
1:08:59
of a lot of science-sourced stories that were pivotal in the conflict and in
1:09:08
public perception beyond the conflict.
1:09:10
So, anyways, my question is,
1:09:15
is that some kind of fair characterization?
1:09:18
That a lot has happened here?
1:09:21
And are there any other places in the world where the forests
1:09:29
have gained such notoriety
1:09:34
and what is the nature of that notoriety and what is the nature of that perception?
1:09:42
I'm trying to step back from where we
1:09:51
might think things were in 1970 and where are we 40 years later, but what's
1:09:59
going on in other parts of the world
1:10:03
in the public view of forestry?
1:10:07
Well, first of all, these forests are exceptional.
1:10:18
We've been writing about it, talking about, they define a
1:10:23
boundary condition of [what] forests can be and what forests can do.
1:10:38
And, because they are exceptional and because we have done so much
1:10:45
science on them, they really have had a tremendous impact on both
1:10:56
the science and the public perception about forests.
1:11:05
So,
1:11:14
at the same time,
1:11:18
they have had a very broad, general impact on the perception of forests,
1:11:28
and I talk about natural forests being these incredible, complex systems
1:11:40
and, more than anything, the lessons for human beings should be humility for
1:11:48
such richness and complexity, humility.
1:11:56
So, I would say that
1:12:02
our research on these forests has had impacts on human perception throughout
1:12:10
the world in terms of really providing an appreciation and examples of richness
1:12:22
and complexity of natural forests.
1:12:27
I think that the consequences of what we've done here, and very broad, much
1:12:32
broader than the specifics of our forests.
1:12:37
That said,
1:12:40
I think we have had an exceptional collection of people doing
1:12:48
science in these forests.
1:12:53
And I don't mean just our group.
1:12:56
I mean even the people like the Steve Silletts of the world.
1:12:58
[tree climbing forest ecologist at Humboldt State U. who did his
1:12:58
PhD in part in Andrews Forest] So,
1:13:04
once
1:13:10
we begin to get the resources and build the cadres of
1:13:17
scientists and students, it's
1:13:22
really built on itself.
1:13:24
It's fed back on itself.
1:13:28
I
1:13:30
don't know if I could or should, but I would argue that we probably know
1:13:37
more about these forests than we know about any other forest in the world.
1:13:46
So, no longer is it a matter of them simply being recognized by
1:13:52
ecological theory, they've defined
1:13:59
the boundary theories of a lot of ecological
1:14:11
theories.
1:14:12
So, maybe we know more about these forests than any other forests in the world.
1:14:18
I would venture to say that the public, that's sort of the science
1:14:25
part of the deal, and maybe increasingly the humanities, and
1:14:35
there are all the coffee table books, all this kind of stuff.
1:14:42
So, there's a rich science and there's a rich bunch of communicating by many
1:14:49
parties, including environmentalists, and
1:14:54
industry folks, who are advocating for the forest from
1:14:58
their different points of view.
1:14:59
So,
1:15:03
those are other dimensions of
1:15:08
public communications and discourse about the forest.
1:15:15
So, it sort of makes me wonder how one might characterize the profile of public
1:15:20
knowledge and feeling about forests in different biomes of the world?
1:15:26
And, like you know, every forest type has its advocates and eloquent spokespersons.
1:15:36
I'm just trying to think of what that profile might look like in
1:15:40
other regions like the northeast.
1:15:44
You know there's the historical work, of course, of our buddy, David Foster,
1:15:50
and others there at Harvard Forest.
1:15:52
There the people like, you know, Thoreau, and others who...it's interesting that,
1:16:00
in his case, part of his work is about forests, course when he was wandering
1:16:07
the landscape, it was mostly agriculture,
1:16:13
but he did find a warm spot in his heart for forests.
1:16:22
Anyway, I'm just trying to step back and think about what we have
1:16:27
here, and how to think about it.
1:16:30
Is there writing that you know of yet, about this kind of stuff?
1:16:36
I mean there was the collection of books, mostly in the '90s, like [William]
1:16:41
Dietrich [The Final Forest] and [Alston] Chase [In a Dark Wood,] and others.
1:16:46
You know, Jon Luoma of The Hidden Forest, which happens to be about the
1:16:49
Andrews, but I don't think he said much about the larger public perception.
1:16:56
But maybe we have to get into the 21st century a ways before we can see that.
1:17:05
I don't know.
1:17:06
I'd say, one measure you could look at, and it's hard to see, it'd be hard to
1:17:13
trace quantitatively the connection, but the general sense that nobody supports
1:17:23
cutting old-growth forests anymore.
1:17:27
I mean you don't have support for that in western Oregon for god's sake.
1:17:34
So,
1:17:37
it's got to be part of a general education and appreciation.
1:17:48
So, by that measure, something's happened, something's changed.
1:17:55
It's more than an awareness; it's an appreciation as well.
1:18:02
So, it would be very hard for us to go back to our old policies at this point.
1:18:10
Right,
1:18:14
in fact,
1:18:17
I would see, I could imagine a book on your personal history,
1:18:23
which is then a book about forests,
1:18:29
a major theme is this whole topic of societal engagement with forests.
1:18:37
Shifting the social engagement from the era of, you know, the old-time
1:18:45
logging, and then the industrial, highly mechanized logging to, this entirely
1:18:51
different engagement, and it's really amazing the dimensions that it has.
1:19:00
It's really changed.
1:19:04
No, I agree.
1:19:08
Yep.
1:19:09
And, you know, one other aspect of this, is we began by focusing on old
1:19:17
growth and our appreciation really
1:19:26
has, I think, expanded to have incorporated the [whole] sere.
1:19:34
So, comment on that a little bit more.
1:19:36
Why don't you run through the history of your perception of how some of our,
1:19:45
how our focus has shifted,
1:19:51
concerning different stages of forest development.
1:19:56
Sort of run through that chronology as best as you can recollect.
1:19:59
You know, we started out by focusing on
1:20:08
the most spectacular and the most awesome forest condition, which
1:20:15
was that of our old-growth forest.
1:20:20
And from there we began to think more and more about how they evolved.
1:20:30
How do these forests develop?
1:20:34
Then,
1:20:37
of course, a variety of circumstances, but certainly included St. Helens, shifted
1:20:46
our focus very sharply on disturbances, severe disturbances and the kinds of
1:20:53
conditions they create, something we've gotten very far from because, the really,
1:21:01
the great forest disturbances of the late 19th and early 20th centuries have faded.
1:21:13
But, we did shift back to look at disturbances,
1:21:20
then, ultimately, we were prepared to, oh yeah, let's look at the entire sere.
1:21:31
Including that period following the disturbance.
1:21:34
And, look at it not as a transition of getting back to forest
1:21:40
cover, but rather looking at it for what it is within itself.
1:21:46
So, for me, it was a full circle, because, there were two forest conditions,
1:21:57
particularly that I experienced as a youngster growing up.
1:22:02
One was the old-growth forest that we camped in, and the other was the
1:22:08
Yacolt burn that we hunted deer in.
1:22:11
And, so, I had an appreciation and an affection for both;
1:22:18
and I appreciated both.
1:22:21
But, it hasn't really been until the last few years that I
1:22:27
could bring that all together.
1:22:33
And, interestingly, it turns out, that the thing that the foresters, the production
1:22:38
foresters love the most probably turns out to be the least interesting out
1:22:44
of all the stages in the sere, because it's the most simple, the most singular,
1:22:51
the most focused, the least diverse.
1:22:57
So, anyways, it's really interesting, but it's taken a long time to develop the very
1:23:05
holistic view of forest development and understand how all of it is important.
1:23:15
So, we started with the most spectacular and, I guess, in a sense we ended
1:23:22
with the second most spectacular.
1:23:24
[Laughter] In a sense.
1:23:28
Well, we've been going for a couple hours, so maybe we should call it quits for now.
1:23:34
Thank you very much; and I look forward to the next conversation
1:23:37
and there are lots of holes to be plugged, lots of gaps ... [both laugh].
1:23:43
It's been fun to think about these things.
