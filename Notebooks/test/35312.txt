00:02
Okay, good morning, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State
00:07
University College of Forestry.
00:10
I am here in the U.S. Forest Service Region 6 office with Becky Gravenmier, the
00:18
Science and Climate Change Coordinator, who is shared between Region 6 and the PNW
00:26
Station [both U.S. Forest Service] . We are here and we're going to be doing an
00:30
oral history interview for the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project that
00:36
will be centered on the Northwest Forest Plan and her involvement in that,
00:41
but not necessarily be all on that.
00:43
We will include some biographical information about her and her
00:46
career, which includes twenty years with the U.S. Forest Service, and
00:50
twelve or so years with the Bureau of Land Management before that.
00:54
So anyway, we're going to be talking about the forest plan, like I
00:58
said, and other things that she has done with her career and her life.
01:02
So anyway, good morning, Becky.
01:04
Good morning.
01:05
I want to thank you for being here.
01:06
And I'm looking forward to this interview.
01:08
So, I start the interviews off the same way.
01:12
I say, give me a biographical sketch of yourself, where were you born and
01:15
raised, and how would you like to present the beginning of the interview?
01:20
Okay, I was born and raised in Charleston, West Virginia.
01:24
Always had a natural resource background interest, always did a lot of hiking with
01:28
my father and a lot of outdoor activities.
01:31
So, I started looking to go out West to go to college.
01:35
I wanted to be in forestry.
01:37
So, I applied to Utah State University in my junior year of high school.
01:41
I was in English honors and other honors programs, and so I was accepted
01:44
early, and so I kind of knew where I was going, and I was going to go West,
01:48
even though I'd never been there.
01:49
And I went to school at Utah State for four years.
01:53
I started out in forestry and then transitioned to rangeland ecology.
01:59
So, what happened when you were young, other than hiking with
02:03
your father in the Appalachian area, the Blue Ridges or wherever?
02:08
Yes, in the Great Smokies.
02:09
[Tennessee/North Carolina]
02:10
Great Smokies.
02:11
Was there any particular experience that led you to wanting to go into forestry?
02:16
Like, did you read Gifford Pinchot's biography or something like that,
02:21
or did you get inspired by something you saw or heard about forestry?
02:25
We always did a lot of hiking in the state parks.
02:28
And then Cherokee, North Carolina, we used to always go up onto the forests
02:32
there, and so, I talked to forest rangers.
02:34
And then career days at school, I was always interested in the
02:37
foresters that came to talk with us.
02:39
And then my science teachers inspired me to look into forestry.
02:43
How interesting.
02:43
Yes.
02:44
Now, Charleston is the capitol, correct?
02:46
Yes, sir.
02:47
And how would you describe the culture of Charleston when you were growing up?
02:53
Well, it hasn't changed much since I was growing up.
02:56
Charleston's kind of the same as it was back in 1963
03:00
to '81 when I was there.
03:04
I just, it's kind of a smaller community, not too big of a city.
03:09
But I lived in South Hills,
03:13
just an average, you know, American town, but kind of, you know, a
03:18
little behind the times from other places, I would say, the Virginia
03:22
and Pennsylvania, and other places, a little slower pace of life there.
03:26
It still is.
03:29
We obviously know that West Virginia, Virginia and
03:34
Pennsylvania are coal country.
03:35
Yes, sir.
03:36
What did you see in the degradation of the landscapes, the big,
03:44
open pit mines, the tailings, pre-environmental movement stuff?
03:48
Maybe you saw some of that when you were small.
03:51
Did that affect your view about what can happen when conservation measures
03:56
are not planned, implemented, you know, whether it be hydrological
04:02
resources, the forest, etc.?
04:05
My mother, her father worked in the coal industry.
04:08
So, I kind of had a background in that.
04:12
And he wasn't living when I was born, so I did see a lot of that as we drove
04:18
across the state because we would travel a lot and do skiing, and that
04:20
kind of thing, and talking with people.
04:24
So, it did kind of inspire me to want to protect the natural resources and to try
04:28
to protect the forests, so that people can use and enjoy them into the future.
04:32
Now, what did your father do professionally?
04:35
My father worked for Union Carbide.
04:38
Okay, so a chemical company?
04:39
Chemical company, yes.
04:40
A chemical company and my mom was from coal mining.
04:42
So
04:44
was this your form of counter-cultural revolution?
04:48
I don't know, I guess you could say so.
04:49
My mom also worked for the Department of Child Nutrition.
04:52
She started the school lunch program in the United States.
04:56
So, what led you to going to Utah State and coming out to the Cache Valley?
05:00
I was very interested in skiing.
05:03
I did a lot of racing in high school.
05:05
Oh, so you were an athlete?
05:07
So, I wanted to come out West.
05:09
And I really just had never been out here, but I was looking at Colorado State
05:12
or Utah State, and they had a fairly decent forestry program there, whereas
05:16
most of the people that I knew were going in forestry, were going to WVU, but I
05:20
wanted to get away from West Virginia, head out West and do something different.
05:24
You wanted to find mountains with real verticals?
05:27
Exactly.
05:28
Yeah.
05:29
So, what was your favorite ski resort in Utah?
05:32
I would say Alta. I liked Alta and Park City.
05:33
Snowbird?
05:33
And Snowbird, too.
05:35
Yeah, all of them.
05:37
There's a couple up there in the Cache Valley, too.
05:39
Right, yeah, we hit those.
05:40
They're all over the place up there with that good Utah powder, right?
05:43
Right, right.
05:44
So, tell me about your experience at Utah State?
05:47
You probably had a remedial understanding of forestry and what natural resource
05:53
management meant as a high school student, especially if you had good mentorship.
05:58
Right.
05:59
But, you really don't know professional level until you get into the meat
06:04
of college studies, and then, professional development after that.
06:07
So, tell me kind of your remedial understanding of it when you were in
06:10
high school and how that changed, and what you learned at Utah State, and
06:14
maybe some of your mentors or classes that were especially important to you?
06:20
Okay.
06:20
Well, like I said, I started out in forestry for the first,
06:25
I'd say for the first year.
06:27
Then I kind of transitioned at Utah State to rangeland ecology, after I took a
06:31
couple of intro classes to range science with Dr. John Workman and John Malechek.
06:37
But I went to forestry summer camp the first summer, and that's where
06:40
I kind of decided, maybe I really wanted to do more in the range field.
06:45
It was something more interesting.
06:46
I wasn't really into cruising timber, I decided.
06:50
And of course, back then, it was still the traditional, economic
06:53
industrial model of forestry.
06:54
Exactly, yes.
06:56
The “New Forestry” of Jerry Franklin was twenty or fifteen years away.
07:00
Right, it wasn't there.
07:01
So that was not attractive to you.
07:03
Why would range lands have been different?
07:05
Well, I didn't really know much about range lands back in West Virginia.
07:09
I knew about animal husbandry and agriculture, but you didn't
07:13
have a lot of range lands.
07:14
And so, I was just really kind of fascinated with that type of
07:17
an environment and how you would manage that into the future, and
07:21
all the plants that are out there.
07:22
I just kind of realized that my focus maybe should be more
07:25
on range lands versus forestry.
07:30
Now, what do you remember, you would have been, this would have
07:32
been in the early '80s, right?
07:34
'81 through '85.
07:36
'85. And what do you remember about watching society,
07:41
the broader culture change.
07:42
Of course, 1963 was when you were born, am I correct?
07:47
Yes, sir.
07:48
That is a year after Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.
07:51
Right.
07:52
The famous book, that actually, John Kennedy read, and it made a great
07:56
impact on what he tried to implement, and the paradigm shifts that became
08:00
what we call the “Environmental Age,” were really in motion as you
08:03
were developing as a young person.
08:07
What do you remember about those debates in West Virginia, but also
08:10
when you came out West, as you were coming of age intellectually?
08:14
I would say in West Virginia when I was going to high school, most of my
08:21
peers, they really weren't interested in the natural resources because they
08:25
were more interested in business, or teaching, or other science,.
08:31
So, I didn't really have anybody else that I would discuss any of these things with.
08:35
And I didn't do a lot of early reading on some of those key
08:40
literature pieces when I was younger.
08:42
I just really became interested in forestry.
08:45
I wanted to learn more about it and knew I was more interested in that
08:48
kind of science, and being outdoors.
08:51
I really wanted to work outdoors and so that's why I kind of moved to
08:53
Utah State and wanted to learn about forestry and started studying that.
08:57
I then realized I liked rangeland ecology, it was kind of a newer field.
09:02
Less was known about it.
09:03
And I found that kind of interesting, like the rangeland ecology with
09:06
Dr. West there, and others.
09:10
I just found it fascinating, because I didn't know anything
09:13
about those kind of environments.
09:15
Now, going back to West Virginia again, or even the Smokies or
09:20
any of your Appalachian area.
09:22
Sure, in the East.
09:23
Do you remember any particular trip or travels with your father or school or
09:28
anything, where you saw something in nature that had to do with human impact
09:34
or natural resource management, maybe of the negative impact variety that made
09:40
an especially strong impression on you?
09:42
I would just say really like you said earlier, some of
09:44
the coal mining practices.
09:46
Okay, yeah.
09:47
You know, some of those are still done today, but just seeing some of what those
09:50
environments looked like after that.
09:52
I'm trying to think of any other specific examples.
09:55
But I also forgot to mention that I did have an interest, like I said, back there
09:59
of learning about forestry, so I went to two different forestry summer camps.
10:02
Okay.
10:03
In my, I think, my junior and sophomore years, to try to learn a
10:07
little bit more about forestry and outdoors and West Virginia studies.
10:11
I took a class, a summer class there, as well.
10:14
And so, I worked with professors at the local community colleges and WVU [West
10:18
Virginia U] , and got a little bit of a background, learned my dendrology,
10:22
started all that kind of thing.
10:23
So, you had a good background early on then.
10:25
Yeah, and I did a lot of spelunking with my father and worked with
10:30
some limnologists in caves.
10:31
You could see where people had come in and just taken chunks of old fossils
10:37
out that probably shouldn't have been touched, some sharks and things like that.
10:40
So, just seeing what people can do, if things aren't regulated, or just
10:45
people don't have an education and they just go out and do things, and
10:49
don't realize what they're doing.
10:52
Or they do know what they're doing.
10:54
Yes, they do, yeah.
10:54
Because they're going to make money off of it.
10:55
Right, exactly.
10:57
So, you're at Utah State, and how do you think the "big topography,"
11:04
as I call the West, affected you?
11:07
The bigger mountains.
11:09
I mean, the Appalachian aren't small, but they're not the
11:12
Rockies and not the Cascades.
11:13
Right, right.
11:14
How do you think that big topography, the scale of things, impacted you as
11:18
you started your professional track?
11:21
I would say, because I had never actually been out West before I went to Utah State,
11:28
and I just kind of [realized] it was going to be new, it was going to be a journey.
11:30
So, I took off in my parents' station wagon, stopped at KOA's,
11:34
and drove to college with my trunk in the back and all my belongings.
11:39
It was just an incredible journey for me, a learning journey and
11:43
a growing journey, because I got to see new country and I couldn't
11:46
believe how big and wide open it was.
11:47
And I was like, wow, you know, these are real mountains, as I drove into Colorado.
11:52
Oh, you went through Colorado though?
11:53
Yeah, I went through Colorado.
11:54
Not Wyoming, not through the top.
11:55
Okay.
11:55
[North of Colorado]
11:55
I wanted to see Colorado, and I went up to Utah State.
11:58
And when I came to the Wasatch Cache [Valley] , I was just like, I'm so
12:01
glad I chose this place, because it was gorgeous and there was just, a lot to see.
12:06
And a lot of agriculture there, a lot of fruit, but also a lot of
12:10
forestry and a lot of timber, and just really, high alpine country.
12:15
It had a whole range of ecosystems to look at.
12:20
Any favorite places up there in Utah or even southern Idaho?
12:23
You're up close to that area, or Wyoming, kind of in that corner there.
12:27
Well, I still like the Moab district, like you and I were talking earlier.
12:31
I like southern Utah, again the range [high desert] . But I also
12:35
like just even up Logan Canyon.
12:37
To me, that's just a nice, little get-away from Utah State.
12:40
We spent a lot of time up there, you know, going to forestry summer
12:43
camp up there with Dr. Daniels and others, and just going back-and-forth
12:48
all the time, and going up there and reading studies, that kind of thing.
12:51
So, you know, half a day trip up and back.
12:55
Now, Utah is phenomenal place.
12:56
It is a great place.
12:58
I fell in love with it when I saw my first geology book that my grandparents
13:03
gave me when I was seven, and it had a picture of Bryce Canyon.
13:07
Yes.
13:08
And I remember, those little hoodoos and spires, and I just told
13:11
my parents, I want to go there.
13:12
Yeah.
13:12
And it also had a picture of the Grand Canyon and Arches and
13:15
some other things, because the geology is so, the geomorphology
13:20
especially, is so dramatic in Utah.
13:23
Right.
13:23
To show erosional processes and, you know, sculptures that are other-worldly,
13:29
that you don't see in a lot of places.
13:30
Exactly, and I had the luxury of working on the desert in the San Rafael Swell.
13:34
I managed a lot of the grazing allotments out there, so I'd be out there by
13:37
myself, you know, looking at all those sites and reading my range studies for a
13:42
couple years before I came to Portland.
13:44
One thing I forgot to tell you about is one of the other places I really
13:47
like, the high Uinta Mountains.
13:49
The first year of college, I worked for an outfitter there packing horses, and
13:55
cooking, taking my turns as different types of leads, and taking a lot of people
14:01
out on pack trips for a week at a time, sometimes ten days or just on a day.
14:05
All the way up into the—to King's Peak and Emmons and all the big ones.
14:10
In Wyoming, yeah, up in Wyoming, too.
14:12
It's a very unique mountain range.
14:14
Yeah.
14:14
Because it goes east to west.
14:16
Right.
14:16
And it has those little mountain cirques up high, so, you
14:20
remember, probably better than me.
14:21
Yeah, so that was fun.
14:23
Very cool.
14:23
So, you get out of Utah State in '85 with a degree in?
14:29
Basically, range management, they called it then, not range ecology.
14:34
But with a minor in forestry, just a B.S.
14:38
Then, what was your first professional gig?
14:42
Well, I worked many summer jobs.
14:45
My first professional gig, I guess, while I was waiting to find my permanent
14:48
job with, hopefully, the Forest Service or BLM, I worked for Dr. David Pike at
14:53
the university [Utah State] , helping him with some of his research.
14:58
So, I worked there for nine months to a year, and then I was able to get a job
15:02
with the Bureau of Land Management in the Moab District, but basically the San
15:07
Rafael Resource Area, in Price, Utah.
15:09
But you were based in Price, though, right?
15:10
Price, Utah, yeah.
15:11
I became a Range Conservationist, a GS-579, is how I started.
15:17
Very interesting, though, you're right by coal.
15:19
In '86.
15:20
You're still by coal country, though.
15:21
Yes, I followed it.
15:23
Right there on the Book Cliffs and the Roan Cliffs, and there's
15:27
all those coal places up there.
15:30
Right, right.
15:30
So, it followed you from West Virginia?
15:31
Yes, or I followed it,
15:34
right.
15:34
So, tell me about your first gigs there, your first jobs, and for the BLM.
15:41
And you worked in the San Rafael Swell a lot, right?
15:44
Yes, sir.
15:44
Yeah, tell me about that?
15:46
It was a good learning experience.
15:48
Again, I was just learning how to apply what I'd learned in college
15:51
about range ecology and I did a lot of
15:57
grazing trespass [work] , going out and looking to make sure people are grazing
16:00
in the right pastures, working with a mentor there, I forget his last name.
16:07
His first name was Dave.
16:10
He kind of showed me the ropes, then sent me on my own.
16:13
I would do a lot of grazing trespass, and I did a lot of rangeland studies.
16:17
And then we started to do a San Rafael land management plan.
16:23
So, I became an integral part of that team.
16:26
I did the rangeland work there, and that's when we first started learning
16:30
GIS, Geographic Information Systems.
16:32
We started getting computers and “MOSS,” what we called Map
16:36
Overlay Statistical System.
16:38
So, I got trained on that and helped manage the data for the whole team.
16:43
And just kind of got in more of the data management arena as well, but did
16:47
a lot with the resource management plan.
16:49
So, I've been working in planning, well, it'll be thirty-two years this fall.
16:54
I've been kind of working on the planning side of things my whole career.
16:58
It kind of started there in the San Rafael, doing rangeland work, and then
17:01
doing the rangeland piece of that RMP.
17:03
[Resource Man.
17:03
Plan]
17:04
Now, what did that teach you about traditional land uses and users on
17:09
the lands, and specifically in the context of the Sagebrush Rebellion,
17:14
which came in during the 1980's.
17:17
It really peaked, maybe a little before you started.
17:19
But a lot of those sentiments were still there.
17:22
Right.
17:23
And how do you remember the people and the reactions, and how you dealt with that?
17:29
The resistance to control, basically.
17:31
Yeah, well, it was quite interesting.
17:34
In the San Rafael, there were actually two of us that were
17:37
female range conservationists.
17:38
And there weren't very many [women] in the Bureau of Land Management at that time.
17:41
So, when I first got there, I remember the first day I showed up on the job,
17:45
they said, "Well, let's go out and get the horses and let's go out for
17:48
a ride on the range on the Buckhorn Draw." So they said, "Why don't you
17:53
go get your horse and load it up in the trailer?" They wanted to see if I
17:56
knew how to load a horse on a trailer.
17:58
And my own work partners were watching.
18:00
And then we went out, and I went with ranchers, and first of all, they're
18:03
like, "Oh, there's another woman out here." Because they didn't want somebody
18:07
from back East coming out here to tell them how to manage their range lands.
18:13
And they were maybe not doing things in the best interest of
18:16
the range and the production.
18:20
So, it was kind of a challenge and it took a long time to win people over,
18:24
but I was able to do that in about the three-and-a-half years I was there.
18:27
I made a lot of permittees more comfortable with our work and what we
18:32
were doing, and that we were really there to help them, and you know, in a
18:34
lot of drought situations people didn't want to have to take their cows off, so
18:38
we'd try to negotiate and have an early warning system and work with them to
18:43
make the transition easier so they could find alternate grazing [areas] . But,
18:46
it was a challenge just being a female, and also a young person coming into
18:51
that environment, working with a lot of older ranchers, and old families
18:55
that had been in the ranching business.
18:57
Do you think you being a woman helps you in that context?
19:00
Actually, it was hard to overcome that challenge, but I
19:03
think in the long run, it did.
19:06
There wasn't a lot of antagonism between the ranchers and myself.
19:11
We learned to work together, to collaborate more instead of an “us versus
19:14
them.” We tried to work out something.
19:19
I just wanted to let you know that it's cool if you want to talk
19:21
about it [gender issues in relation to relations with stakeholders]
19:21
. Right.
19:22
Okay, so continue on with your dealing with the ranchers.
19:27
Yeah, so it was a challenge when I first started because I was
19:30
an outsider, number one, I was a female, and I was from back East.
19:34
I was a youngster.
19:35
They didn't want a young pup telling them anything.
19:39
And so, it just took a long time to start working with the group of ranchers.
19:42
I had about, I'm going to say, thirty different grazing allotments that were
19:46
mine [to administer] . And so, I went out and started meeting with all the
19:48
different ranchers that I worked with and tried to establish a relationship.
19:51
But it took a couple of years before they actually trusted me and we were
19:54
able to work through problems and look at their grazing situations,
19:58
and figure out how to better manage their particular grazing allotments.
20:02
But it was a challenge.
20:03
And, you'd see it on fires, too.
20:05
Like, oh, you're a female, maybe you can't do this, or you can't do
20:10
that, you should do this instead.
20:11
You mean, the physicality of fighting?
20:11
The physical, you know, I did a couple, maybe only a few fires when
20:15
I was down there, but you could see that a little bit in those days.
20:18
Again, that was '86, '87, '88.
20:21
That's some pretty wild country there, the San Rafael Swell.
20:24
Yeah.
20:25
I mean, a lot of people even that know Utah, don't know that as well
20:29
as some of the other areas, because it's not a park, it's just kind of a--
20:33
It's a big, open area.
20:34
Big open area.
20:36
With few roads.
20:36
With that giant monocline and the cut-through, all the canyons.
20:39
It's a gorgeous area, though, but, yeah.
20:41
It's marvelous, yeah, a lesser-known gem.
20:45
Yes.
20:46
Yes.
20:46
And so, were
20:52
there many forests that you worked with?
20:54
The Swell is pretty low [elevation] . The forest, you've got to get up in the Roan
20:57
and Book Cliffs, in that area, right?
20:59
Well, I worked with Manti-La Sal [National Forest] quite heavily.
21:01
So, you didn't?
21:01
Yes, I worked up Huntington Canyon as part of my, I had the
21:02
Huntington grazing [allotment – canyon area on Wasatch Plateau]
21:02
. Okay, on the Wasatch Plateau.
21:03
Yeah, so I had the Huntington grazing allotments that abutted
21:07
up to the Forest Service there.
21:08
And I also had worked one summer as a range tech on the Wasatch right
21:15
down there on the Manti-La Sal.
21:16
Okay, so you did have some exposure to that, even though it's obviously
21:21
ecologically a much different forest, a much drier forest, but
21:26
still, you had some experience.
21:27
I worked with the forest folks there on range readiness, when they
21:32
were ready for cows to come on.
21:34
We worked on a lot of issues with deer in that area, particularly
21:40
on the Huntington allotments.
21:41
And I'll refer to this a little later because you worked with the BLM;
21:46
your operative document was FLPMA?
21:49
[Federal Land Policy and Management Act of]
21:49
Yes.
21:50
Instead of whatever the 1976 Forest Service Act for management was, tell
21:57
me about FLPMA, and then we'll talk about maybe how that compares to
22:00
Forest Service planning later on.
22:02
Well, I'm not really an expert on FLPMA.
22:07
But just how do you remember its provisions and the processes
22:10
affecting how your office did work?
22:13
Well, really, we didn't work so much with FLPMA.
22:18
Again, it was my first three-and-a-half years with the
22:20
BLM, so I worked mostly on grazing.
22:23
I used more the directives, the manual and handbook equivalent that BLM would have.
22:28
I can't even remember what they're called now.
22:31
And the state director's [BLM] guidance on how to implement
22:34
FLPMA and everything else.
22:36
As we started doing planning, I focused more on the planning
22:39
side and doing rangeland studies.
22:41
I didn't do a lot.
22:42
And we were doing a resource management plan under FLPMA.
22:47
We had strong guidelines from what we called “State Director's
22:50
Guidance” that told us how to do the land management plan.
22:56
We just kind of had a stepwise process we worked through.
22:58
So, I didn't do a lot with the regulation itself.
23:04
Now, this was the late '80s, correct?
23:06
How long were in Price?
23:07
I think till 1990.
23:09
That's when I moved to Portland.
23:10
Okay.
23:12
What do you remember knowing of the debates that were going on in the
23:18
'80s before you arrived here in terms of the “Forest Wars,” as they called
23:22
them, and building energy in the '80s.
23:26
And you arrived in '90 really right when things would start to peak
23:31
with the Dwyer decision [Injunction over Northern Spotted Owl/logging on
23:33
federal lands] the following year.
23:34
Right.
23:35
But did you know anything about it when you were out in
23:38
Utah, or were you just kind of
23:41
exercising your new professional chops in the BLM context, and you maybe heard
23:48
about stuff that was kind of out there?
23:50
Right.
23:50
I heard about it originally from a lot of my other members that were in
23:55
the Society for Rangeland Management.
23:56
I was quite active in that my early years in Utah, and did a lot with youth there.
24:01
But I had a lot of friends that were from up here and would be
24:05
talking about what's going on with spotted owls, that kind of thing.
24:08
That's why I was very interested when I saw a position become open
24:11
with the BLM here in Portland.
24:15
I had started doing spatial analysis and that was kind of a unique skill.
24:19
They were looking for someone to come in and help run all of their western
24:23
Oregon RMP's [resource management plans] , the very first round of
24:26
those where they were going to do all of their western Oregon districts.
24:29
They were looking for a person to come up and lead the GIS analysis for that.
24:33
So, I applied and was lucky enough to get that position.
24:37
They actually hired two of us.
24:38
Another gentleman was also hired, who was a cartographer.
24:41
But I was really excited because I wanted to see what was going on up
24:45
here and to get more involved in the forestry end of things again, and
24:49
just try to do something different.
24:51
Because it was another new frontier to kind of see what's going on with GIS and
24:55
analysis and using that technology to help us manager our forests and rangelands.
24:59
Now, you learned your GIS when you were at Utah State?
25:01
No, no, I learned it on the job.
25:04
Oh, okay.
25:04
As part of that planning process.
25:05
I thought maybe you had some early computer training.
25:08
No, we just learned it.
25:09
We didn't have GIS then.
25:10
It was brand new when I first started with, basically, the San Rafael.
25:18
So, I learned it there.
25:19
Do you remember those old computers?
25:21
[Laughs]
25:21
Yes, I do.
25:22
Yes.
25:23
Tell me about the capabilities that you had then versus now?
25:26
Well, the first computer we had was about this big, and this long.
25:30
You can't see it but, you know.
25:32
She's basically creating a box, 3’ x 3’ x 3, ’ somewhere thereabouts.
25:37
And it had very limited capacity.
25:39
We couldn't run a summary of all of the vegetation for,
25:44
let's say, the Moab District.
25:46
We could only do a small portion because it wasn't powerful enough.
25:48
But that was considered to be a big machine, and it was
25:51
linked into the state office.
25:53
But, it was all new technology and they didn't know about how to, the
25:57
configuration control management wasn't all figured out, so we were
26:00
working on one stand-alone system.
26:02
The computing power really wasn't there.
26:04
Even when I started here with the BLM, the computing power really wasn't there.
26:10
Well, 1990, it was 1990, pre-internet.
26:12
Yeah.
26:12
It was very different.
26:14
Well,
26:16
the Forest Service had the “Data General.” We didn't have an
26:18
email system for quite some time.
26:22
Now, was there any applications in the Moab District when you were there,
26:28
regarding the Endangered Species Act [ESA] , or that did not enter the
26:35
central management issues at that time?
26:36
Not really on the rangeland.
26:38
I'm trying to think if we had any, we didn't have many species
26:42
conservation concerns there.
26:47
I'm trying to think, we didn't have the tortoise or anything,
26:49
so we really didn't have any T&E [Threatened and Endangered] species.
26:50
So, when I first came to Portland was my first real experience [Endangered
26:53
Species Act] , with the marbled murrelet, and we've got the spotted owl.
26:56
So, that was something new that I encountered when I moved here.
27:00
Now, I think the issues then when you were in the BLM were starting to be
27:05
the wilderness designation issues, but I don't think the San Rafael Swell
27:11
was yet on the table, if you will, for one of the future wilderness areas.
27:17
No.
27:17
It would become a bit later, so.
27:19
Right, right, right, and it was really more just rangeland health, and droughts,
27:24
and dealing with those kinds of things.
27:26
How would you have considered the health of the rangeland when you were there?
27:29
I mean,
27:32
some of the classic studies of rangeland degradation [early-mid
27:35
20th century] , are actually on the Wasatch Plateau, for instance.
27:37
Yes.
27:37
And I'm not sure about the [San Rafael] Swell, that's a harsher land.
27:41
It's lower.
27:43
But how would you consider the land and the recovery thereof from
27:47
what you saw when you were there?
27:50
I would say, when I first got there, I was like, wow, because I'd looked
27:55
at different rangelands in Utah, and then, when I went there, I was thinking,
27:58
these are quite over-grazed situations.
28:02
Most of the grazing allotments I had had been overgrazed
28:06
since the '60s.
28:08
So, we were trying to work on that with our new land management plan
28:12
to try to reset that stocking level.
28:15
That's what we were trying to do.
28:16
And of course, that's very controversial, because you're going
28:18
to be cutting people's permits.
28:19
But, the historic permits had been in place for quite some time.
28:22
When I left, it was still pretty much over-grazed.
28:26
And we had instances of reoccurring drought, and a lot of those allotments
28:31
didn't have much forage at all to be grazing, and you're just kind
28:34
of wondering, how in the world are those cows making it on that?
28:38
Yeah, I've hiked through the San Rafael Swell in that area, and one
28:42
thinks, I don't know how many cows there are per how many acres, but
28:46
that's some pretty meager forage.
28:49
I worked a lot with the wild horses and burros there.
28:51
We had a major over-stocking issue, and I think they still do today,
28:55
down there, with those critters, too.
28:57
And so, we did a couple of removals while I was there and roundups
29:01
to try to get some of the burros and the horses off the rangeland.
29:05
A lot of times, you'd find a couple of them dead here and
29:07
there because of lack of water.
29:09
Water was a major issue.
29:12
So, our biggest conflicts there were just regular wildlife, like
29:14
bighorn sheep and grazing with deer.
29:20
So, when you got here in 1990, what was your position, what did you do,
29:26
and what were you charged with doing?
29:27
I was a GIS Analyst.
29:29
I was hired to help with the western Oregon plan revisions.
29:33
And again, it was the first time they'd undertaken doing, I think, five or six
29:37
districts at once, and they had just started trying to build the consistent
29:42
GIS data layers across all that area.
29:45
And so, that was a big-ticket item that no other agency that I know of in the
29:49
West, had tried to do anything like that.
29:52
So, I was very thrilled to come out here and be part of that.
29:55
They had already started building some of the base data, the GCDB
29:59
coordinates, and then they built the ownership layers and all that.
30:03
I helped them build some of those layers, and then we started
30:06
doing the planning process.
30:07
I helped them figure out how to analyze the data that they did have to look at,
30:13
how do you build an alternative, how do you analyze impacts to the resources.
30:18
And so again, I was learning this as I was doing it, but we had a very large
30:22
contractor that worked for us called Infotech Development, at that time.
30:26
Okay.
30:26
They were spending a lot of money trying to build the western
30:28
Oregon land management plans.
30:30
And again, a lot of it was because of the O&C lands [former Oregon and California
30:34
Railroad lands managed by BLM] and the high value of the timber out here that
30:36
they were getting a lot of money thrown at them to try this new thing, we're
30:39
building GIS, and using it in forest plan or land management plan revisions.
30:45
There was a lot of interest and a lot of money thrown at that.
30:48
And so, they hired a whole staff to come in and help do that.
30:51
We were ahead of the Forest Service at that time, using what we called
30:56
MOSS, at that time before ArcGIS.
30:59
That's the acronym for?
31:00
MOSS Overlay Statistical System, it was one of the earlies.
31:03
Like GRASS was one of the earlier GIS, and then it was MOSS, and then
31:06
it became ArcGIS and ESRI Products.
31:09
Okay.
31:10
So, how would you describe the BLM's view of managing the resources
31:16
at that time when you came?
31:18
You know, they were doing a lot of timber harvest.
31:20
But they
31:24
were getting a lot of criticism because spotted owls had just started
31:27
to be a big thing, and they didn't even have maps of spotted owls.
31:30
I helped Joe Lint build the very first spotted owl center map.
31:35
Where are these spotted owls located?
31:37
So that we could say, okay, how do we manage the forest when we
31:40
know spotted owls are in the area?
31:41
Then we started working with [U.S.] Fish and Wildlife Service on that, and
31:44
we were sharing our maps with them.
31:46
Then that kind of led into this whole thing with the Gang of Four
31:50
[Jerry Franklin, Norm Johnson, Jack Ward Thomas, John Gordon] . I
31:50
worked on the GIS analysis for that.
31:52
Again, we didn't have all these maps pulled together between Forest
31:54
Service and BLM, so we had to do some inter-agency work together to build
31:59
some base layers for all of that.
32:02
I just pulled out what they call the Gang of Four Report.
32:05
Yes.
32:05
Which Norm Johnson gave me and I copied; "Alternatives for Management of Late
32:09
Successional Forests of the Pacific Northwest." So, you worked on this?
32:12
I worked on the GIS part of this.
32:14
The GIS part of that, so this?
32:16
And the mapping part of that.
32:16
This actually came out of something you did, the cover?
32:19
Well, maybe not, I didn't do that, my contractor did.
32:20
But yes.
32:20
Well, but what I'm saying, but the work you did was the baseline that produced
32:25
this and other cartographic products.
32:27
We worked together, between Forest Service and BLM.
32:28
And the first time the Forest Service and BLM had actually worked
32:29
together on something like this.
32:31
That's why it was a big-ticket item, because it's the first time we actually
32:35
coordinated and did something together.
32:36
Usually, we were kind of like, we're not going to coordinate on a lot
32:40
of things, but we were forced to coordinate and get our data together.
32:44
And that was the first time we tried to do some consistent mapping.
32:48
So, just take it back a little bit farther.
32:50
Because this collaboration is part of, and the synergy between
32:54
agencies that were formerly apart.
32:57
Right.
32:57
It's part of this discussion we're having today, as well as this project, and
33:00
the Northwest Forest Plan in general.
33:04
Do you remember it being that way, also, when you were in Utah?
33:06
There was the Moab District.
33:08
There was the Manti-La Sal [National Forest] . Did that [collaboration] occur?
33:11
There was a little bit of coordination, like I said, on like range readiness
33:14
for the grazing, when were you going to turn the cows on them.
33:16
We had some of the same permittees and we would meet,
33:19
you know, and talk about those.
33:20
But mostly, a lot of that was done through my involvement with Society
33:24
for Range Management and just professional relationships with people.
33:26
So, I started trying to collaborate with Manti-La Sal, but it wasn't
33:30
like we did a lot of things together.
33:31
We didn't have consistent data sets, we didn't have any GIS data at that time,
33:34
as we were just starting to build it.
33:36
But the Manti-La Sal didn't have any, so we couldn't map things together.
33:41
When I came to Oregon was the first time I saw agencies really trying to
33:45
work together on tough issues like what do you do about late successional
33:50
forests and critters like owls.
33:54
And so how would you describe the BLM as a culture when you worked for it in
33:59
your twelve years that you were there?
34:05
I really loved the agency.
34:07
I always thought I'd stay with the BLM, but I just kind of morphed
34:10
into working with the Forest Service again as we started to work together.
34:13
I realized that our missions are very similar, you know, we have
34:17
slightly different missions, but the work is still rewarding.
34:22
So, I just was always interested in working with the Forest Service from
34:25
day one, and just seeing how we could collaborate and manage the lands.
34:29
Again, we should be looking at all lands, not just Forest Service versus BLM.
34:32
And in Oregon, we have the checkerboard situation with BLM where your private land
34:37
and intermixed with the Forest Service.
34:39
How to manage that has always been, that's right.
34:40
So, it needs to be managed together.
34:42
So, I found that, as this project in particular, the Gang of Four,
34:45
was the first step in trying to collaborate and work together
34:49
to better manage these forests.
34:52
Well, I mean, the first high profile critique of the
35:03
linearity, if you will, of the grid system.
35:06
Oh, yes.
35:07
That's what I was looking for.
35:10
Remember, if you read about John Wesley Powell, he wanted to manage by watersheds.
35:13
[When USGS Director.]
35:14
Right, right.
35:15
And you can even take that kind of practical, ecological, hydrological
35:21
idea, and take it forward into what is done in different contexts in the
35:25
future, because the checkerboard system is impossibly difficult to manage.
35:32
Exactly.
35:32
And it doesn't really have anything to do with natural boundaries and water flows
35:39
and energy flows, and what have you.
35:41
And where owls and birds and deer and everything go, they don't look at the
35:46
lines and say, oh, my God, you're on private land now, you've got to go back.
35:50
Right.
35:51
So, I think what you're saying is that the synergy between agencies working together
35:59
is necessary to manage natural places.
36:02
Right, right.
36:03
Because it doesn't care if humans surveyed it and drew a line on the map.
36:08
Right.
36:09
And so, that's interesting.
36:10
We'll talk about that maybe later.
36:11
Sure.
36:12
As we're talking about your cartography, your understanding of representations?
36:18
Sure.
36:18
And divisions, whether it be cartography or what have you.
36:24
It's 1990, you're doing your GIS work; do you remember
36:34
when the Dwyer decision came down?
36:36
Was that central to what you guys were doing, correct?
36:38
Yeah, that really was.
36:41
The Dwyer decision, I wasn't that involved with it, but it had
36:44
implications for what we were doing.
36:46
It kind of amped up the importance of getting a lot of our data layers in
36:50
shape, so that we could do analysis at a quicker pace instead of just waiting
36:54
for our land management plan process.
36:57
And so, that kind of kicked off the mapping the spotted owls center,
37:02
and the building a lot of other data that would help support the
37:06
kind of analysis that's in the Gang of Four and in the FEMAT report.
37:10
Right.
37:11
Now, when you first got here, the injunction hadn't come down,
37:16
but about a year later it did?
37:18
I think so, yes.
37:18
Is that about the timing?
37:19
[Dwyer injunction was in 1991.]
37:20
Yes, I think so.
37:21
Did that make the people in your agency scramble to try to
37:24
figure out how to deal with it?
37:25
Because I think the BLM came to grips with it a little differently than the Forest
37:29
Service did, because I think more of the lands were Forest Service lands [spotted
37:34
owl areas] , but they weren't all.
37:35
Right.
37:36
But we had the O&C lands, too, where the counties are looking for the.....
37:40
The timber receipts and what have you.
37:41
The timber receipts, so it was a big-ticket item.
37:43
And I remember getting called to Dean Bible's [office] , he
37:45
was the State Director during a lot of the time I was there.
37:49
Of the BLM?
37:49
Of the BLM.
37:50
Of Oregon?
37:51
Of Oregon, Oregon-Washington BLM, and he'd always wanted to say, "Okay, I
37:54
want to see the latest maps on owls." He'd call me to his office on a Friday,
37:57
and I'd run down there, even though my supervisor [wasn’t] in, and you were
38:01
supposed to take two supervisors with you.
38:03
Nobody was around, so I'd just go there and he'd be pulling out all the
38:05
maps, and he'd want to figure out how we're going to manage, and how we're
38:09
going to deal with the injunction.
38:10
And he was really into the spatial data and what we could do with that.
38:15
And then he started thinking, you know, like we need to start
38:17
collaborating more with the Forest Service and others adjacent to us,
38:22
so we can better manage these lands.
38:24
So, people at the BLM were thinking they had to go in that direction then?
38:28
Yeah, but this was really where it was first forced.
38:31
And again, we had different data management systems, and actually, the
38:35
Forest Service was just ahead of us.
38:38
Actually, we had more data, they had no consistent data across all their
38:43
forests, but they were doing things, and they got ArcGIS before we did.
38:43
So, when we got into FEMAT, they were
38:50
a little bit ahead of us.
38:51
We were still on the old system, the MOSS system, so we didn't know
38:54
the new system and new technology.
38:56
So, there was a huge learning curve of the two agencies working together,
39:00
and then, training us on how to use the new system when we started
39:04
working on these projects together.
39:05
That sounds like a really important part of the collaborative process
39:09
that was forced by technological reasons and lack of knowledge in
39:15
another technology or another system.
39:17
Right.
39:17
To better interface and be able to share and dialogue between the systems,
39:21
and to make them more effective?
39:23
Uh-hum.
39:23
Okay, so what did you do again on the Gang of Four report,
39:28
do you want to explain that?
39:29
Well, that was a big mapping exercise where everybody brought their big maps,
39:32
most of the people had hard copy maps.
39:34
They brought them in to, I don't even know what building it was held in, in Portland.
39:38
But a lot of the scientists were there and they were all bringing maps, so we
39:42
were creating, if we didn't have them digitally, we were making sure that we
39:46
had them on overlays and things like that so they could be taken to this
39:52
big meeting where they were putting the Forest Service and the BLM side-by-side.
39:55
Because again, our data wasn't integrated at that time, so
39:58
everybody, everything was done with mylar overlays and big, large maps.
40:02
So, that's kind of what my role was, to help produce those maps and to oversee
40:05
the contractors and make sure we had all the data at the table that we
40:08
could bring forward for that exercise.
40:11
And a lot of our scientists you've interviewed, they were part of
40:13
that whole meeting and looking at that and producing this report.
40:17
And we just provided support on the data side.
40:19
So, you did not actually go to the meeting yourself?
40:21
No, I was working on the data and the maps, getting them ready for that session
40:25
and delivering them, that kind of thing.
40:27
Now, what sense did you and/or your colleagues in the BLM have, or even
40:34
anybody that you were interfacing with through the Forest Service, have about
40:39
the gravity of what was coming down?
40:41
I mean, did anybody realize that this was going to be this
40:44
profound paradigm-shifting moment?
40:47
Or were you just doing your job and moving ahead – you and GIS?
40:52
I was in the GIS shop, and so I wasn't in the planning shop or
40:59
the natural resources program.
41:00
I was more in the data shop or we were supporting those [other programs]
41:03
. But, we had a team of three people.
41:05
Dr. Duane Dippon was in the planning shop, and I was in DRM, and then, we had Chris
41:11
Cadwell, who now works I think, for O&C counties, but he worked for BLM as well.
41:17
The three of us were the group that was formed to help bring in some
41:22
of the analysis that's in here.
41:23
So, those guys would attend the meetings and they'd bring back, "Here's
41:26
what we need, Becky," and I would help translate that and bring in the
41:30
information and the data layers and, working with our contractor, produce
41:34
so many different sets of mylar overlays or whatever they needed done.
41:37
And so, I was kind of like there to translate what they
41:41
needed into analytical products.
41:44
Now, were you also involved with providing products, data, cartography,
41:50
GIS information, that the people that were taking back to Congress,
41:55
for instance, that this was followed-up by the ISC report later.
41:59
Right.
41:59
And then there were the various, certain high-profile people going
42:04
back and testifying before Congress.
42:06
Right.
42:06
Were you also involved with supporting that process?
42:09
Right, Dean Bible and I don't know who else from BLM at this point in time,
42:12
it's been so long ago, [to remember] who went back to do some of the testifying.
42:16
But I think Dr. Joe Lint from BLM [northern spotted owl
42:20
biologist] , was involved in that.
42:21
But we just did the base mapping for that.
42:22
Any map products they needed, we would do multiple versions of those
42:26
so that they had what they needed to be able to show Congress and others.
42:30
But intimately, I'm not familiar with what happened in those.
42:33
And of course, pre-PowerPoint, so these were physical maps?
42:35
That's right, they were physical maps.
42:36
Big maps.
42:37
And they were big, or they were page-size.
42:39
Well, if you're in a congressional hearing room, you need a big map.
42:45
Right, right.
42:46
With a little pointer, right?
42:48
Exactly.
42:48
Right.
42:50
And a lot of overlays.
42:51
So, you had a lot of transparency overlays?
42:53
Yeah, they would map them on the wall, and then they would have these
42:56
overlays of different data layers, yes.
42:58
The good-old days.
42:59
That's right.
43:00
I liked the good-old days.
43:02
I love paper maps.
43:03
I do too, still.
43:05
So, you're doing his same position for how many years now?
43:10
Or not position, but the same type of work?
43:15
Well, actually, what I did is I came to work on that project till
43:22
about 19—I would say, '93, '94, then I started working on FEMAT.
43:28
They moved us over after Gang of Four [-] . We went back and we were
43:31
still working on the planning process.
43:33
And then FEMAT came, and that started coming together.
43:37
The President’s plan came out, and they had the big conference out here.
43:43
Well, the Summit.
43:44
The Summit, yes.
43:45
The Forest Summit.
43:45
The Forest Summit.
43:46
Which was Bill Clinton.
43:47
With Bill Clinton.
43:48
Al Gore, and his cabinet.
43:50
Right, they all came out.
43:51
That was a big-ticket item for us.
43:53
I volunteered and worked the registration desk for that.
43:55
That was kind of fun.
43:56
Wow!
43:57
And then after that, they said, basically, FEMAT.
44:01
You know, we had that happen.
44:02
And then they also started talking about the Columbia Basin project.
44:06
And so, I worked on FEMAT through '94, and then, I moved over to, in '93-'94, to
44:12
help lead the GIS analysis for what they called Interior Columbia Basin Project.
44:16
We're going to talk about that, too.
44:17
But I want to talk about that in parallel because there are interfaces
44:22
and there are interesting comparisons.
44:24
There are.
44:24
You know, in terms of where it went, where it didn't go, public focus or lack
44:28
of public focus, and follow-through, etc. We'll talk about that, too.
44:34
Sure.
44:35
So, we're back on the record here.
44:37
We took a short break.
44:38
And
44:42
Becky was talking about the Gang of Four report, as it's called.
44:46
We're also going to talk just briefly about the SAT report and the ISC report,
44:51
which were the predecessors to the Gang of Four, and then, the FEMAT was later on.
44:56
So, just tell me a little bit more about how you were involved for
44:59
writing support information mapping and data for those two previous reports?
45:05
Well, I'd just arrived in, I want to say February of '89.
45:15
So I was only here for a short while before we started
45:18
getting into these things.
45:19
And I think the very first one, the SAT [Scientific Assessment Team] and
45:22
the ISC [Interagency Science Committee] report, we didn't really have a lot
45:24
of data or a lot of things mapped.
45:26
We were currently trying to map them.
45:28
As I recall, we were trying to pull together anything we could
45:31
for Oregon and Washington, so that they could have something on a map.
45:35
That's where I don't remember exactly what year we started mapping.
45:38
Like where are the spotted owl centers, where are the spotted
45:41
owls, where's our vegetation?
45:43
We had forest inventory information and we were getting
45:46
that digitized in the early '90s.
45:52
We were just compiling that information as fast as we could, to try to feed
45:54
it into those two types of exercises.
45:56
So again, I was just in a support role providing the data, and trying to get
46:00
the GIS coverages complete with metadata, etc. so that they could be put on maps
46:07
and brought forward for the state director and the planning directors and other folks
46:13
to take forward to those two processes.
46:17
I wasn't intimately involved in them myself, but Joe Lint was,
46:19
and I worked for Joe Lint a lot.
46:20
And he was one of the main people, right.
46:22
He was one of the main people.
46:22
So, Joe really went and represented us a lot, and then he'd just come back and
46:26
say, "Becky, I need X, Y and Z," and we'd pull it together with contractors.
46:30
But again, it was early stages of having any data to put on maps.
46:33
And what do you remember about the completeness or lack of
46:37
completeness of the information, on the owl or other key variables?
46:42
Well, we in Forest Service, basically, we had information about where people
46:47
thought the owls were, but it was on paper copies in file cabinets.
46:50
And so, what we did is we worked with folks to get them pulled out and get
46:54
them translated to large maps and mylars, so that we could then digitize them.
46:58
So, I worked with contractors who were then digitizing and putting
47:00
all the data together, running the quality control, that kind of thing.
47:04
That's what we were focusing on then, trying to pull all the data
47:06
out of the data cabinets, get it digitally captured and available so
47:11
that we could produce maps for at least Oregon-Washington-BLM lands.
47:15
And then BLM, like we said, BLM was a little bit ahead of Forest Service at that
47:18
time in trying to be consistent with that.
47:21
But we helped the Forest Service as we started moving into these
47:24
later projects like FEMAT.
47:26
They had different data sets, but we tried to merge and pull them
47:29
together so that they had a cohesive package, we had a cohesive package,
47:32
and then we put them together and merged both of our two data sets.
47:37
How difficult was that?
47:38
That was a big process, especially with the stuff going on in FEMAT.
47:43
There was a very short deadline to get that project done, so we had contractors.
47:49
That was great.
47:49
BLM had the luxury of having contractors round the clock.
47:53
And so, they were doing digitizing, I would say sometimes 24 hours a
47:57
day, just trying to get our maps and some of the Forest Service's
47:59
captured, so that we could put them all together and create some of those
48:04
early maps that were used in FEMAT.
48:07
And for the record, FEMAT was the, as I like to call it, the "90-day slumber
48:13
party" [intense work marathon] in the Pink Tower, which is the U.S. Bank
48:17
Building here in downtown Portland.
48:18
Right.
48:19
And it was a 60-day charge by the Clinton administration initially to put together
48:28
basically a massive synthesis of the best possible information and options and
48:33
alternatives which you were supporting.
48:35
For how to manage.
48:35
And then they added 30 days, because they couldn't get it all done in 60 days.
48:40
[Clinton administration did not like options from first 60 days.]
48:41
Right.
48:42
How do you remember that whole process being unleashed on your agency, and you
48:49
were working with the Forest Service?
48:51
I jokingly called it a 90-day “slumber party,” because some
48:55
people actually slept in there.
48:57
We did.
48:58
In the building, and so, what do you remember about when that was unleashed
49:03
on the two agencies, and how your bosses and the managers said, okay
49:09
guys, we have this amount of time, we have this to do, there's this
49:14
building, we have one floor, I think, one floor or two floors, I believe?
49:17
Right.
49:17
Well, actually, all the GIS work was done between the
49:19
Forest Service building and BLM.
49:22
The GIS support was done elsewhere.
49:23
Right.
49:24
So, we were over in, I'm going to say, over by 39th [Street in
49:29
Portland] , BLM was over that way.
49:29
And then the BLM, the Forest Service was just down here at their other
49:33
building before they moved here.
49:35
So, you were in southeast Portland then, right?
49:37
Yeah.
49:38
We would go back and forth many times a day, and if not, working
49:41
at the Forest Service office.
49:42
But we did a lot of digitizing, and the mapping was all being done at the
49:47
BLM office, and the analysis, we were doing over at the Forest Service.
49:52
Because they, again, had the better equipment, were ahead of us.
49:55
We'd pulled together a lot more people that actually had experience
49:58
with ArcGIS and how to do that.
50:01
So, basically what they did, is they set up a huge team of us, they
50:06
called it the Spatial Analysis Group.
50:06
They had Dr. Duane Dippon on the BLM side, and then John Steffenson
50:06
on the Forest Service side.
50:06
They were the co-leads.
50:06
I was part of the Spatial Analysis Group and I helped lead the analysis
50:06
piece, so that was my charge, and then, working with contractors to
50:06
have a lot of our data digitized.
50:06
We finished digitizing and pulling all that together.
50:06
You can see the little list there of the Spatial Analysis Group, John Steffenson.
50:36
We had a whole team, I'm going to say there's probably…
50:37
We're looking at the front of the—I mean, excuse me, the FEMAT document.
50:41
Yeah, and we had a whole variety of folks that are some key contractors.
50:47
So, this was a team of contractors, Forest Service, and BLM folks, and we
50:50
also brought in a rotation of folks from different forests to help us out,
50:55
people who had any GIS experience.
50:57
We'd bring people in that were specializing, let me look here
51:00
and see some of these names.
51:09
I don't see his name there now.
51:11
John Young, he came in and was working specifically on spotted owls.
51:15
We had different people who had different areas of focus, based on their expertise.
51:18
He was a wildlife biologist and providing GIS support.
51:21
Jeff Nighbert was working on the cartographic products.
51:24
He built all the fancy nine maps that are in that document.
51:27
He's the one that created those maps.
51:31
You mean, each alternative?
51:31
[Called “alternatives” in FEMAT process]
51:32
Each, Options 1 through 9, Jeff did all the mapping.
51:34
And the rest of us were doing a lot of the analysis and the digitizing and maps.
51:42
We had some of the base maps, but then there were people like you interviewed,
51:45
Dr. Bruce Marcot, they were pulling together a lot of information on what
51:50
does all this mean to different species.
51:54
He hadn't mapped
51:58
species ranges, and so we digitized those very quickly.
52:01
We had to produce.
52:02
I remember probably working a 20-hour day with a contractor just trying to get a
52:08
whole series of maps that he had to have for the “Pink Tower” for the next day.
52:11
So, we would work around the clock to bring these map products
52:15
physically to the scientists, who were locked in the pink building.
52:18
So, my little joke about the Pink Tower being the “slumber party” actually
52:21
extended to other places around Portland?
52:24
Yes, yes.
52:24
You guys were working some long hours.
52:26
Yeah, we were.
52:27
But we had the luxury of having the InfoTech Development Group,
52:32
that actually was a contracting group, and they basically had
52:36
people working different shifts.
52:37
And then, we would have different shifts for some of us that were the
52:40
leads, and again, just worked long days.
52:42
But we had several people that did sleep in the Forest Service building.
52:46
Our analysts, we didn't have enough computing power -- like you were
52:50
talking about the small computers -- we didn't have enough computing power to
52:54
process a lot of this data in ArcGIS, and also, not a lot of knowledge
52:57
about how to do it, so we were exporting things and summarizing them
53:04
into value attribute tables.
53:06
So, basically turning them into flat files and bringing them into Oracle.
53:10
We had one Oracle programmer that was there.
53:12
And so, I would say, Bob ended up having to do a lot of overnighters,
53:18
because he was the one programmer that was doing all the analysis for us.
53:22
We'd translate it into these are the steps and the things you combine,
53:26
and here's all the analysis in GIS.
53:27
And we'd pop it over to him and he'd have to go in and run [it
53:31
to] analyze the alternatives.
53:33
And he was doing all that programming, just one person.
53:36
So, where were the best printers located for the big maps?
53:41
Over at the BLM office.
53:42
They had the big professional plotters.
53:44
Okay.
53:44
Yeah.
53:46
We spent a lot on mylar and a lot on paper.
53:49
Yeah, I was going to say, it's amazing how many trees have
53:52
to die so you can save trees.
53:54
Right, right.
53:56
But again, people wanted to see the big maps, so they could look at the landscape
54:00
and not just look at page-sized maps.
54:01
Right, and you were still at the time when people were still
54:06
using mylar and things like that.
54:09
At the end of that project, we had a room about this big that we're
54:12
sitting in, what is this, 16 x 20?
54:16
But full of just mylar overlays that all had to be catalogued and
54:19
inventoried that were part of the record.
54:21
And so, we had a lot of map products that were developed.
54:24
And do these things still all exist somewhere?
54:26
They were sent to the records center, yes.
54:30
We used to keep them here in this building, or in the old Forest Service
54:34
building, but we just ran out of room.
54:35
And the mylars were getting old and, but there is also an archive of all the data
54:40
from that time, it was also archived and is available, and it's in the records
54:44
center, and we also have a copy here.
54:47
So, you're this support staff along with all the cartography and data processors
54:54
and you're producing this thing.
54:57
You must have sensed that this was really important.
55:01
How did you feel about what was going on
55:06
at this time, and this was many years ago when you were still
55:09
relatively early in your career?
55:11
Right.
55:12
And did you ever think that this was like a massive, earth-shaking,
55:17
paradigm kind of project, or was just a really super-busy time?
55:23
I think a lot of us working on the project realized that it was going to
55:26
really change the way we do business, and how we collaborate between agencies.
55:30
We knew that it wasn't going to just be BLM doing their thing and Forest
55:33
Service doing their own, that we're all going to have to work together.
55:35
And then, we were learning on the fly how to do analysis, because
55:39
none of us had ever really done this kind of analysis before.
55:43
There wasn't really anybody to help us, so we were just putting the best
55:46
brains together about how do we do this analysis in the most efficient
55:49
way with the systems that we have in order to produce these maps.
55:54
But mostly, the analysis of alternatives, like the nine options.
55:57
Then we had to analyze how many acres of this, how many acres of
56:00
that, and summarize what are the impacts of each of these alternatives
56:03
on different species, on spotted owl habitat, on murrelet habitat.
56:09
So, we'd get the definitions of what the habitat was, and then we'd go in and
56:12
calculate it from the data that we had.
56:14
And then run that against the alternatives, and you have to summarize
56:17
everything by the land use allocation.
56:18
So, it was a very highly technical
56:22
time period.
56:23
We had contractors that would work with me, and I'd say, this is what
56:26
we want to do, and we'd translate.
56:27
We basically set up processes and I probably still have some of these
56:31
records in my own personal records, because I didn't want to get rid of them.
56:35
But how do you translate that?
56:36
We'd actually write up analysis processes and quality control, QAQC
56:41
steps on how you check the acres, and what should the acres all add up to so
56:44
that we were always making sure that our outputs were the right numbers.
56:47
Did you have the right magic number at the bottom when you add up the
56:49
total for Forest Service and BLM?
56:51
Are these the correct land use allocations?
56:52
Do they all add up once we calculated those?
56:54
And just really how do you document [it all] . Each time we did an analysis,
56:58
we would actually go through a whole process of documenting, what are the
57:01
steps, and then charting that out and doing data flow diagrams and all of that,
57:06
to make sure we didn't miss something.
57:07
There was like a team of four of us that did that kind of work,
57:11
and then, we'd hand it off to the programmer, who then would go into
57:14
Oracle and pull all the data together.
57:17
So, he didn't have figure all that out, we figured it out, and then
57:19
worked with Duane Dippon and John Steffenson, who then worked with the
57:22
scientists over in the Pink Tower, to say, this is what we're going to do.
57:25
Does this sound like the right kind of analysis?
57:27
And they'd bring it back and say, "Becky, figure this out," and we'd
57:30
figure it out, and then we would go and run that analysis that night.
57:33
Have any of you ever written a paper about the process of this?
57:37
I think there's a chapter in here [FEMAT] on spatial analysis.
57:39
But I mean like a peer-reviewed journal thing about the process of this?
57:43
I think John Steffenson did.
57:45
He now works for ESRI.
57:47
Okay.
57:47
John Steffenson and Duane Dippon both did, but I don't know exactly
57:50
what the name of that paper is or where it is at this point.
57:51
Because it was such an important time, not only in terms of the Northwest
57:55
Forest Plan, but in terms of the evolution of technology and how computers
58:03
became used in many facets of society.
58:07
Yeah, I think there is a piece in here somewhere in
58:11
one of the appendices about the spatial analysis process.
58:14
I'd have to find it, but it's either in here or it's in the
58:19
EIS.
58:19
We do have a chapter written there somewhere on that because I
58:22
remember writing that with John.
58:24
But
58:27
I think they did a couple journal articles after that, but I
58:30
couldn't put my hand on them today.
58:32
I'd have to look through my records, my personal records to see if I
58:34
have them in my early files for you.
58:37
So, this must have been for you and a lot of your other colleagues,
58:41
like advanced graduate studies?
58:44
Yes.
58:45
For what you were doing.
58:47
I mean, you're not going to get this kind of training just going to a class.
58:52
Right.
58:52
It was great on-the-job training working with Joe Lint, Bruce Marcot,
58:56
Gordie Reeves, and other scientists, on what kind of analysis do they need.
59:03
Marty Raphael was part of that as well.
59:06
And then we would try to figure out how to do it.
59:08
And we had a group of us conspire about that, and then work with
59:11
Duane and John and make sure that that's what the scientists wanted
59:14
before we ran the alternatives.
59:16
They'd run stuff over to the Pink Tower and say, okay, it's thumbs up,
59:19
and then we'd come back and run it.
59:20
We'd produce the maps, take it back, and they'd go, well, we don't
59:22
like this, go change something, something doesn't look right.
59:26
And we'd come back and rerun, and rerun.
59:28
So, it was a constant process of back-and-forth.
59:30
But it was learning as you go, and analysis on the fly, and
59:35
it was pretty high-tech at that time for, you know, capacity of
59:38
ArcGIS that we didn't have yet.
59:40
That's why we had to do a lot of stuff in Oracle, because we didn't have
59:45
the experience.
59:46
And then ArcGIS had a lot of limitations at that time because it was a very
59:50
early version of that software.
59:54
Compare early GIS with what you can do today?
59:57
Just for the record.
59:59
Well, I still work in the data management.
1:00:02
I kind of left for a while and came back, but I work a lot with ArcGIS online
1:00:08
which is basically putting GIS in the hands of the public and the average
1:00:13
user, who doesn't know how to use GIS.
1:00:15
I work a lot on climate change information here in Region 6, and
1:00:19
we are using ArcGIS online to share that data and make it available.
1:00:23
We presented some of our work at the ESRI Federal GIS Users Conference in 2015
1:00:30
back in D.C. about how are we using ArcGIS online to map our climate, our National
1:00:36
Forest Service climate change score card results, and how are we using that to do
1:00:41
climate change vulnerability assessments.
1:00:42
We basically took a climate change vulnerability assessment, a big report
1:00:45
about this big, about an inch-and-a-half thick, and we basically read all that
1:00:49
information in, so it's basically a map journal or what we call a “story map.”
1:00:53
I'm working with the latest technology now, and we have a lot more capabilities
1:00:57
that you can do a lot of things with that we used to have to do with
1:01:00
tons and tons of code just in ArcGIS online, and not being even an end-user.
1:01:06
You can just get in and do some of these things that used to
1:01:08
take us a lot of code to do.
1:01:11
So, the technology has come a long way.
1:01:13
So,
1:01:17
you worked through the whole 90-day process on this then?
1:01:19
Oh, yes.
1:01:21
And then after the conclusion, we worked with the EIS team, too,
1:01:26
as they produced the follow-on report to this, which is the EIS.
1:01:30
The Record of Decision?
1:01:31
The Record of Decision.
1:01:32
I worked through the whole process.
1:01:33
So, we have the Record of Decision, Standards and Guidelines.
1:01:37
Right, that came out in '94.
1:01:38
Which is '94.
1:01:39
And so, you just continued?
1:01:41
Yeah, the whole team continued.
1:01:43
We went from this [FEMAT] directly into this [ROD-SAG] , so
1:01:45
there was no gap in time.
1:01:46
We had a little bit of downtime, but then we came in and started working on
1:01:49
this, because we had to tweak things and work on the map products in here.
1:01:54
And actually, this is the document that has the chapter in it.
1:01:58
There's an appendix on the GIS piece, but in the EIS.
1:02:03
But yes, we went from that, to this.
1:02:06
So, Alternative 9 is selected.
1:02:09
Option 9.
1:02:12
It's implemented.
1:02:14
And we go forward from there.
1:02:16
So, you're still with the BLM, correct?
1:02:20
Yes.
1:02:20
Until '97, am I correct?
1:02:23
Yes.
1:02:23
Okay, so what was your role initially as the discussions were starting about
1:02:31
how we are going to monitor and how we're going to track this plan, which
1:02:38
there was such a big to-do about, but what are we going to do now?
1:02:42
What was your role early-on?
1:02:43
Yeah, I was still more on the data management side because that's
1:02:46
strictly what I was doing for BLM.
1:02:48
But we did work with some of the scientists to develop the overall
1:02:53
effectiveness monitoring program for the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:02:56
They were working on this, and then--
1:02:57
That came out in '99, correct?
1:02:58
[NWFP monitoring program baseline document.]
1:02:59
That came out in '99, but it was being worked on for quite
1:03:03
a while, five years really.
1:03:04
And they already had monitoring ongoing for n orthern spotted owl and
1:03:08
I think marbled murrelet came on next and the late successional monitoring.
1:03:13
[Forest Service ecologist] Miles Hemstrom worked on that one.
1:03:15
But they started developing protocols, and the last one they developed
1:03:18
was the aquatic and riparian, which came out, was it 2003 or '04.
1:03:24
It was quite bit later.
1:03:26
But most of ours, we didn't really work mostly on this at all, we really
1:03:30
just made a few maps here and there when they needed them for this, but
1:03:33
we were still focusing on cleaning up all the data and everything from this.
1:03:37
Then I actually transitioned in '94, went to lead the Interior
1:03:42
Columbia Basin Project, again, with John Steffenson as my co-lead.
1:03:46
I was the BLM lead for the spatial analysis group that was going to then
1:03:50
build that data set for all of the Interior Columbia Basin data, do a
1:03:53
similar process that was done for FEMAT.
1:03:56
The goal was it would be a similar process.
1:03:58
So, let's continue, let's stay chronological.
1:04:00
Sure.
1:04:00
Because I was going to do a parallel, but since you segued right there.
1:04:03
Sorry about that.
1:04:04
Let's go with the Columbia Basin Project and talk about similarities, differences,
1:04:09
experiences, how it was modeled and how it was planned, and how it was
1:04:12
actually carried out and implemented.
1:04:15
They followed a similar model to FEMAT as they set up a science advisory group.
1:04:22
They hired Tom Quigley and a whole group of people to do that kind of work.
1:04:29
They had a spatial analysis team, so we basically took some of our same team
1:04:32
members, the people who worked with me doing the analysis, I took them with me.
1:04:36
So, we just moved them from this project and they moved with me to Walla Walla for
1:04:40
quite some time, going back and forth.
1:04:42
But we set up a spatial advisory group, a science team, and then there was
1:04:46
an EIS team that was set up early.
1:04:48
They set the EIS team up early trying to learn from the FEMAT experience
1:04:52
that if you had them set up early, they could work together and we could feed
1:04:57
information and maybe get it done quicker.
1:04:59
One of the lessons learned was that [Interior Columbia Basin] was a really
1:05:03
large footprint to try to do the same thing we did on the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:05:08
With the size of the land?
1:05:09
Yeah, the Columbia Basin area, it was just.
1:05:12
It's a massive area.
1:05:12
It covered so many states and it was just such a large footprint.
1:05:17
Really, it was, I think too large to be fully successful because it
1:05:22
was just such a large footprint, and there were so many different states
1:05:27
and the politics of each state.
1:05:28
And then, just different stakeholders.
1:05:30
And it was more of a public process, where this one [NWFP] was not a public process.
1:05:35
For the Columbia Basin, they wanted to make it more of a public process.
1:05:38
So, we would have public meetings where we first started building maps.
1:05:42
We'd come and show off our maps and be up all night working on them.
1:05:45
Okay, we need some maps of the vegetation for the whole Columbia Basin.
1:05:48
We'd be up working on those so we could show the public or
1:05:51
others, here are some base data.
1:05:53
It took us a long time to build that base data.
1:05:55
I think I mentioned that we had
1:06:29
a whole leadership set up in the very beginning.
1:06:31
We learned from the FEMAT experience and the EIS, that we needed to have
1:06:35
the EIS team and the science team working at the same time, along
1:06:41
with leadership in a GIS group.
1:06:44
So, we brought all these people together in Walla Walla, that's
1:06:47
where they wanted us to set up.
1:06:49
And so, we would make, again, not a “pink tower,” but it was another
1:06:52
brick building that we all worked in.
1:06:55
Some of us would drive weekly, go up there, and we'd stay sometimes
1:06:59
two or three weeks at a time.
1:07:00
And some of us just ended up with apartments there.
1:07:02
Was it around Whitman College, or…?
1:07:04
Yeah, it was just actually right close to downtown, the downtown area.
1:07:07
Okay.
1:07:08
I should remember the address, but I don't.
1:07:10
Now, somebody told me that one of the sessions was in an Econo Lodge?
1:07:15
Well, we had different public meetings in a variety of different places.
1:07:18
Okay, so that was just one of them.
1:07:21
Yeah, it was one of the public meetings, right.
1:07:22
So what we did is built collaboration into the very beginning of the process.
1:07:25
They wanted it to not be like FEMAT where it was the scientists go off in the Pink
1:07:28
Tower, develop these options and come back, and then hand them to managers.
1:07:32
This time it was going to be the scientists who developed
1:07:35
the science assessment, not the alternatives, necessarily.
1:07:39
They did look at alternatives, but they didn't pass it to the managers,
1:07:42
who then would have more of a role in crafting the overall alternatives.
1:07:47
No, just doing the effects.
1:07:50
So, we set up tandem teams at that time.
1:07:53
And again, I was mentioning that the project, the scope and scale of this was
1:07:57
so much larger than Northwest Forest Plan.
1:07:59
It was quite large.
1:08:01
And with the public involvement piece, we had to hire a whole public affairs team.
1:08:05
There were a lot of people.
1:08:06
I don't know how many we had working at one time, but I'm going to say
1:08:08
250 people in Walla Walla working on some aspect of this project.
1:08:12
And again, we had to build data from scratch.
1:08:14
We did a lot of digitizing with the same group of contractors
1:08:18
back in Portland supporting that.
1:08:19
And we had better networks and systems at that time.
1:08:23
But we had to basically take forest level data for all the national forests
1:08:27
in the Columbia Basin, and the BLM data, whatever was available, and pull
1:08:32
it together, if it existed, in GIS.
1:08:34
And if it didn't, then we did mylar mapping to create a whole
1:08:37
set of over 100, I'm going to say 125, different GIS data layers.
1:08:42
Again, the scientists thought they needed everything.
1:08:43
We probably could have done it with 60 or 70 layers, instead of that many.
1:08:47
But everybody wanted to look at everything when we started doing the assessment.
1:08:52
So, it was going to more of an assessment process that had some inkling of
1:08:57
different types of scenarios, and then we'd pass it to managers and
1:09:00
they would develop the alternatives.
1:09:03
But it took a lot longer than [they thought] . They thought we could
1:09:05
do it in a year, nine months to a year, like the Pink Tower exercise.
1:09:09
With the politics involved and the collaboration piece and having to build
1:09:13
the data sets for such a large area, it took a long, long time to do that.
1:09:18
And so, we started working on that and produced a science assessment.
1:09:23
I would have to look at the year on that one.
1:09:26
It came out and then we had a whole series of publications.
1:09:29
I'm going to say there's probably 32 different GTR's [General Technical
1:09:32
Reports] , some of them about earth worms of the Columbia Basin.
1:09:35
Species ranges, altered rangelands, a variety of offshoot General Technical
1:09:41
Reports that also helped build the science basis for what was supposed
1:09:44
to become the Columbia Basin Plan.
1:09:48
And just to kind of shorten this up a little bit, because we could talk
1:09:51
forever about this project because it was bigger than the Northwest Forest
1:09:55
Plan and went on quite a bit longer, but we had hundreds and hundreds of
1:09:58
scientists and lots of public meetings.
1:10:00
We involved the public along the way for the assessment.
1:10:03
We had a draft EIS, and I think we did a supplemental EIS, you
1:10:07
know, working with the public.
1:10:08
And we were just on the verge of finishing a “Record of Decision” when there was a
1:10:14
change of administration, and all of a sudden, we did not finish that project.
1:10:19
What happened is they tried to take the best of what they could out of
1:10:23
the assessment documents and the EIS, and pull it together in what they
1:10:26
called the Columbia Basin Strategy.
1:10:29
And so, they basically had set up PACFISH and INFISH monitoring to look
1:10:32
at the aquatics components, kind of building on some of the things Gordie
1:10:35
Reeves was doing on ARMP, similar process, the aquatic monitoring
1:10:40
process for Northwest Forest Plan.
1:10:41
They have a similar in-stream component, but they were also
1:10:44
capturing a lot of grazing information.
1:10:46
So, they set up the monitoring early on knowing that we were working
1:10:48
on this project and we needed that for PACFISH/INFISH consultation.
1:10:53
And so, we didn't finish the project.
1:10:55
They did not finish the EIS Record of Decision piece, but they did
1:10:59
build the Columbia Basin Strategy, which is still in effect, together.
1:11:02
Again, it's pulling some of the best principles and actions, like watershed
1:11:07
analysis, that kind of came out of FEMAT in the Northwest Forest Plan, before you
1:11:11
do certain things, doing a landscape scale assessment before you do certain projects.
1:11:17
But some of those principles came over and are part of this Columbia Basin Strategy.
1:11:21
And that Columbia Basin Strategy has been updated, I think
1:11:24
twice, since it was finished.
1:11:27
I'm going to say it was finished in
1:11:30
about 2000.
1:11:31
I think that's about right.
1:11:34
2001?
1:11:34
About 2001.
1:11:36
We just recently updated that strategy.
1:11:38
I came back and helped worked on that with the Columbia Basin Deputies Group.
1:11:41
They asked us to come in and look at that.
1:11:42
What we did is we took the principles from the Northwest Forest Plan, built
1:11:46
that into a framework document, and we looked at the some of the principles
1:11:51
that were very similar because they were kind of offshoot projects.
1:11:54
We pulled some of that together, and basically, took the framework from
1:11:59
the Northwest Forest Plan, brought it over to the Columbia Basin Strategy
1:12:01
and imbedded some of those same principles and concepts, so that
1:12:04
we're looking at the whole Columbia Basin and Northwest Forest Plan in
1:12:07
a similar set of guiding principles that the agencies all signed off on.
1:12:12
And this is how we're going to continue to manage the Columbia Basin.
1:12:15
It's about similar types of management.
1:12:19
Not all the same, as it doesn't have real specifics about riparian
1:12:22
management or anything like that.
1:12:23
But it's just more of a basic principles document.
1:12:26
And there was the BLM, the Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife?
1:12:32
A lot of the same agencies that were in Northwest Forest Plan.
1:12:36
The Army Corps?
1:12:37
The Army Corps was involved somewhat, but not much.
1:12:40
Because of the Columbia River?
1:12:41
Because of the Columbia River, but it was more of, you know,
1:12:44
Fish and Wildlife, NOAA, EPA.
1:12:46
Right.
1:12:47
NRCS wasn't really involved too much.
1:12:49
USGS was a big player and Forest Service Research [Dept.
1:12:54
in Forest Service] . Then we had a lot of partners and researchers elsewhere
1:12:57
that were supporting the project.
1:12:58
But basically, the funding was cut off?
1:13:01
Well, we basically were this close [indicating very] to finishing.
1:13:03
We had a draft biological opinion and a biological assessment, but there
1:13:08
was controversy, over particularly how to manage riparian areas.
1:13:14
So, there was a lot of concern from NOAA about what the riparian
1:13:18
buffers were going to be.
1:13:20
Similar issues.
1:13:20
If you interviewed Gordie Reeves, you'd hear about the riparian buffers.
1:13:23
But similar concerns over there about how wide the riparian buffers were.
1:13:26
[Issue in NWFP planning] So, there were little issues like that that not all
1:13:29
agencies were completely comfortable with.
1:13:31
What happened was, there was a change of administration.
1:13:33
So, it was easy to get the project stopped by certain agencies.
1:13:38
They basically didn't finish it.
1:13:41
But they said, let's try to gather what we can and put it into a strategy,
1:13:44
so we don't lose some of this.
1:13:45
And then the current science that we have, like I said, 35-40 publications,
1:13:51
that are still being used today on the east side for Oregon, Washington,
1:13:55
and Idaho, that are basically still some of the best available science.
1:13:58
There hasn't been a lot of new science that's been done.
1:14:01
But it's still informing project and forest planning.
1:14:05
Very interesting.
1:14:07
How would you compare the two?
1:14:10
I mean, you already kind of went back-and-forth.
1:14:12
But if you were going to make a synopsis statement, how would you compare the
1:14:17
Columbia Basin Project with the Northwest Forest Plan, in a kind of a sound bite?
1:14:23
I would say the Columbia Basin Project was an offshoot of the
1:14:26
Northwest Forest Plan, but it was much grander in scale and issues.
1:14:31
There were a lot more issues that were being focused on.
1:14:33
It wasn't just late seral forests, it was all issues.
1:14:38
The door got opened for the assessment to be everything.
1:14:41
And where this one [NWFP] was more focused on late-successional
1:14:44
[forests/ecology] . So, it [Columbia Basin] just became such a large project.
1:14:46
It was just a little bit overwhelming to manage.
1:14:49
That's why it took so much longer and there were so many
1:14:51
more complexities involved.
1:14:53
Which is also, maybe you could say, where the problem lay was the fact, sometimes
1:14:57
when you try to do too many things.
1:14:59
At once for such a large area.
1:15:00
I think that was the lesson learned is, you know, don't try an
1:15:03
assessment on such a large area.
1:15:05
Because it's just too big, and there are too many politics and too many
1:15:08
governors and interest groups to deal with in trying to collaborate as you go.
1:15:13
It is very difficult.
1:15:15
And of course, I think the obvious contrast is that the FEMAT process
1:15:20
and Northwest Forest Plan was a bunch of scientists getting together and
1:15:25
doing it independent of public input.
1:15:29
Right.
1:15:29
And independent of managers.
1:15:31
And managers, too, right.
1:15:32
I think Cindy [Miner – PNW Station Communications Director] talked to you
1:15:33
about how they locked the managers out.
1:15:34
Oh, yeah.
1:15:35
They would just be invited to come in for certain pieces.
1:15:37
But this project, we had a science team and an EIS team, so science and managers
1:15:42
collaborating and working together.
1:15:44
Sometimes the managers would help us with some of the science,
1:15:46
because we had to build the science before they could start building
1:15:49
alternatives and looking at options.
1:15:52
And I think the example I would make is that it shows you that when
1:15:57
you democratize whole processes, it sometimes becomes almost unmanageable,
1:16:03
even though the concept is great.
1:16:05
Right, right.
1:16:06
So that would be my little assessment or take on that.
1:16:10
Right.
1:16:11
And politics are really coming in to play.
1:16:13
That's really probably the reason we didn't finish the project was because of
1:16:16
politics and a change of administration.
1:16:18
Nobody wanted to sign that Record of Decision and that BA and the BO, and with
1:16:22
the current management that was in it.
1:16:24
The political climate wasn't right.
1:16:26
Now, by this time, you had transferred to the Forest Service, correct?
1:16:31
What I had done is during the last part of that in '97.
1:16:33
Yeah, tell me a little bit how that happened?
1:16:34
In '97, we were still working on the Columbia Basin.
1:16:39
What happened was the project went on much longer than they had thought.
1:16:43
They thought it was a nine-month process, and it became many years.
1:16:46
So people, the scientists, started to leave the project.
1:16:50
There were two assistant science leads, and they left.
1:16:55
They tried to advertise for a Science Advisory Group Team
1:16:58
Lead under Tom Quigley, and they couldn't really find anybody.
1:17:04
Richard Haynes [PNW Station economist] said, "Well, why don't you give
1:17:05
Becky a chance at that because she's working with the science team and
1:17:08
she knows our science." I did a detail, ended up competing, and they
1:17:13
hired me for the GS-14 position.
1:17:15
I did that through, I think, 2000 and 2001.
1:17:18
And we finished the project.
1:17:20
I helped to make sure all the publications got done, and that data CD you have
1:17:24
got published and all the data.
1:17:24
And you're Forest Service during this time?
1:17:26
Yes.
1:17:27
I was basically on a long-term detail to the Forest Service, and then, they
1:17:30
hired me full-time in 2001, and I helped the [PNW] Station with another new
1:17:36
program called Focus Science Delivery.
1:17:38
Then they hired me to assist managers with using our science and to work
1:17:44
on the Northwest Forest Plan again.
1:17:46
I left and went to Columbia Basin, came back, and in 2001 to
1:17:49
2003, I transitioned back into
1:17:53
working on implementation of Northwest Forest Plan with
1:17:56
the Regional Ecosystem Office.
1:17:57
[Forest Service]
1:17:57
Okay.
1:17:58
So,
1:18:02
let's go back.
1:18:02
So, you completely walked away from the Forest Plan after
1:18:06
the FEMAT process, right?
1:18:08
Right.
1:18:08
I went over to work completely on the Columbia Basin Project.
1:18:11
Right.
1:18:11
Because we'd finished all our GIS and data analysis, but there were many people
1:18:14
pulled together that were now what they call the Regional Ecosystem Office,
1:18:18
hundreds of people that were now trying to figure out, how do we implement this?
1:18:21
What does that mean to the science projects that are out there?
1:18:23
What projects on the ground have to be stopped or which ones can go forward, and
1:18:28
then how do we implement the new standards and guides, and what do they mean?
1:18:31
And so, they were working on that through in 2003, they started to get a real good
1:18:36
handle on how do you implement this, and what is the guidance, because they
1:18:39
had to give supplementary guidance to people to understand how to interpret
1:18:45
these regulations or the standards and guides that are in these documents.
1:18:49
So, what do you think the strength of the FEMAT process was and what do you think
1:18:54
the weakness of the FEMAT process was from the perspective of twenty years later?
1:19:00
Well, I think the strength was that it was mandated by the President to do this work.
1:19:05
And they basically, like you said, they locked people [in on it] , and didn't let
1:19:11
people go off and do their other work.
1:19:12
They basically said, you're going to work on this for this
1:19:15
time period until we're done.
1:19:16
And so, they basically sequestered people, and that was their number one
1:19:19
project, their number one responsibility.
1:19:21
Everybody knew it was really important and we had to complete it.
1:19:23
When we did the Columbia Basin and other projects, people still took
1:19:26
vacations, they still were working on other work, it wasn't as focused,
1:19:30
and that's why it stretched out.
1:19:32
So, it [NWFP] was more of a focused project.
1:19:34
I think having that be a focused, shorter time period with dedicated
1:19:38
personnel really helped, versus the other project where it kind of was
1:19:43
too many people, and not everybody was completely 100 percent dedicated.
1:19:47
And then, just the politics and the scope and scale kind of made it unmanageable.
1:19:52
I think it would have been really hard to pull together the data in any--
1:19:55
Yeah, for that large of an area.
1:19:56
In any similar kind of way.
1:19:57
Because it wasn't ready.
1:19:58
And also, the owl and just various factors about old growth
1:20:06
late successional forests.
1:20:07
It was more focused.
1:20:07
Well, and it also had been studied more intensely.
1:20:10
Exactly.
1:20:10
In the five to ten years right before it.
1:20:13
Exactly.
1:20:13
I mean, even though the data sets were incomplete, they were still there.
1:20:18
A lot of research there.
1:20:19
And there was a lot of research there.
1:20:20
And they were in the file cabinets.
1:20:20
Right, and so it was doable.
1:20:22
It had a jump start.
1:20:23
Right.
1:20:23
Whereas, at Columbia Basin, basically [national] forests had maps of their
1:20:31
forest land allocations.
1:20:32
They had those maps.
1:20:33
Each forest had their own individual maps, and then, the maps of grazing allotments.
1:20:37
And so, we had to pull those together, and edge-tie to forests.
1:20:40
And then edge-tie those to BLM.
1:20:43
And, make sure that we had complete coverage.
1:20:45
And so, you'll see that data cd I gave you, those are still the
1:20:48
only data sets that I know of that cover the Columbia Basin area.
1:20:53
I still have people calling me up, usually once a month, trying
1:20:56
to get access to that data.
1:20:57
And I have to say, you know, it's 1994 vintage, but there's nothing
1:20:59
that's been recreated like that.
1:21:02
We tried to get our managers to maintain like a subset of those, like
1:21:06
ten or fifteen different layers, but nobody really wanted to put the money
1:21:09
or the time or energy into that.
1:21:10
So, we tried to have Spatial Analysis Team maintain that because it was
1:21:14
such a rich treasure trove of data.
1:21:17
Right.
1:21:19
What do you think the weakness was of the FEMAT in the Northwest Forest
1:21:22
Plan process, the way it came down?
1:21:24
You kind of brushed that point maybe a little bit, but give a little bit more?
1:21:29
I think on the FEMAT, it depends on who you talk to.
1:21:33
I think some of the managers would say it was science-led and the scientists
1:21:37
didn't understand what implementing things on the ground really meant.
1:21:41
So, there wasn't that integration and back-and-forth
1:21:44
between science and managers.
1:21:45
Can you really implement this?
1:21:47
How would you implement this?
1:21:48
It was more of them not really understanding the planning process.
1:21:51
So, I think that could have been better, but then we went to the
1:21:54
extreme on the Columbia Basin where we kind of integrated those two.
1:21:58
I think it would have worked, had we not stretched the project out
1:22:02
so long and would have condensed it somehow, so everybody was more
1:22:07
focused and working together, instead of two separate teams, and then
1:22:10
just sharing data and information.
1:22:12
Was it always in Walla Walla?
1:22:13
Most of it was in Walla Walla, but we did a lot of the GIS
1:22:16
work here in Portland again.
1:22:18
Was that just basically because it's kind of a central place in the Basin?
1:22:22
No, it was a political decision to do it there.
1:22:24
There was an earmark in a congressional budget, and that's where they decided
1:22:27
it was going to be, because they wanted to bring some money in that area.
1:22:32
Okay, that makes sense.
1:22:34
I mean, I'm just thinking of geographically, well,
1:22:36
you're kind of up there.
1:22:37
And it's south of the Palouse and north of this.
1:22:40
Yeah, yeah, it was a good location.
1:22:40
And we spent a long time in Boise.
1:22:41
Yeah, and so, okay, interesting.
1:22:44
Okay, so, you're away from the forest plan for five years?
1:22:51
Well, I'd say '94 to 2001.
1:22:54
Okay.
1:22:56
What, I mean, you're obviously, you're working BLM and then Forest Service,
1:23:00
you're aware of what's happening.
1:23:02
Right, because I'm still working with some of the same people back in Portland
1:23:04
who were trying to implement this.
1:23:05
I'm still aware of what's going on.
1:23:05
So, you're aware of what's happening.
1:23:08
And what are you hearing, what are you hearing about the successes, the failures,
1:23:13
the struggles, the ideas, the visions, the plans, all the things that are going on.
1:23:21
They're not central to what you're doing, but
1:23:26
you're part of the agency, so you hear?
1:23:28
Right, so I was still heavily tied to BLM and Forest Service
1:23:31
because I was on detail.
1:23:32
So, I would hear from Chris Cadwell and Duane Dippon about some of the
1:23:35
difficulties with trying to implement the Northwest Forest Plan as it was written.
1:23:38
And tell me what, from what you read and what you heard before you came back on,
1:23:43
and then I'm going to have you give your own experience after you re-engaged.
1:23:49
Okay, so, I think, really, just trying to figure out, once that
1:23:53
plan was signed, what projects can go on that are already in process
1:24:01
and what projects might be exempt.
1:24:04
That was a struggle for folks just trying to figure out how to implement that.
1:24:06
And just getting the teams in place to help with the interpretation setting up
1:24:11
this Regional Ecosystem Office and trying to make sure it was interagency, because
1:24:13
this document mandated that we have a regional interagency executive committee
1:24:18
and that we have these different groups.
1:24:20
There was PACs, RACs, PIKES, a whole set of acronyms, and all these
1:24:25
different groups that needed to be coordinating and working together
1:24:30
to try to implement this plan.
1:24:31
And, of course, in a lot of different interpretation, the regional ecosystem
1:24:34
staff, and then just getting that staffed up and getting the right people on the
1:24:37
teams that could figure out what was really the intent of FEMAT, and what was
1:24:41
the intent of the Record of Decision.
1:24:43
Because a lot of the same people worked on this document, and so
1:24:45
they were helping to translate, what does this really mean on the ground?
1:24:47
So, I think it was just really translating this, how do you
1:24:50
really measure or implement things like the riparian buffers.
1:24:55
I mean, I'm sure Gordie [Reeves] can you tell you that they actually
1:24:57
pulled out tape and measured, you know, two tree heights.
1:25:00
And the whole intent was to try to modify that through
1:25:04
time using watershed analysis.
1:25:08
But that didn't happen a lot of places because people were risk-averse.
1:25:11
They would rather just get the tape out because then NOAA folks and
1:25:15
Fish and Wildlife are like, okay, that's the buffer, you're okay,
1:25:18
you can do work outside the buffer.
1:25:20
And so, that was a clean and easier thing – that basically was a risk-aversion piece.
1:25:24
Right.
1:25:24
And so, things like that– just trying to figure out how to make things
1:25:27
work, like Adaptive Management Areas.
1:25:29
They were not as successful as the scientists had envisioned.
1:25:34
Hearing early on, as people tried to set up a lot of collaborative
1:25:37
processes and projects that were great, but they found they still
1:25:40
had to go through NEPA processes.
1:25:42
Either Forest Service or BLM, whatever they were doing, they still had
1:25:47
to follow their standards and guidelines, and you still had to go
1:25:49
through NEPA in order to change them.
1:25:51
To try that experimentation, to try adaptive management, you still had to
1:25:55
modify the existing standards and guides in order to do something different.
1:25:59
Some of those things just were not envisioned because scientists
1:26:02
didn't really understand how the NEPA process worked.
1:26:06
“Survey and Manage” [NWFP implementation rule whereby managers had to survey for
1:26:06
potentially threatened or endangered species beyond the murrelet and spotted
1:26:06
owl] was another challenge for how do you implement that whole process, that
1:26:10
was added near the end as they were filling out the Record of Decision.
1:26:14
I'm sure you've talked to Bruce Marcot at depth about that.
1:26:17
And other people who found it [Survey and Manage] to be conceptually
1:26:21
interesting, but problematic in reality.
1:26:23
Yes, it's still a problem for us.
1:26:28
Yes.
1:26:28
One quote that came from Norm Johnson [regarding NWFP/survey and
1:26:31
manage] ; he said what happened was in many cases where you needed
1:26:36
a coarse filter, they [managers] were forced to use a fine filter.
1:26:39
Fine filter, right.
1:26:40
And I can really understand how that would be almost paralyzing to a manager
1:26:47
in real time and space with limited personnel, and time and labor and capital.
1:26:52
And so, I can see how that would be a problem.
1:26:55
A great idea, but difficult to implement.
1:27:00
Right.
1:27:02
Right.
1:27:02
So, you're hearing all these things.
1:27:05
And of course, there's lawsuits going on.
1:27:08
Right.
1:27:08
And timber communities are struggling, well, they've been struggling for a
1:27:13
long time, but especially after the Dwyer decision, and things don't get
1:27:19
significantly better, even within the context of the theory that there were
1:27:23
going to be certain lands that were open.
1:27:26
Right, right.
1:27:26
The Matrix lands and the like.
1:27:28
They're not able to get the probable sale quantity out that was promised.
1:27:31
Right.
1:27:32
And so, even in the first couple years, they were able to get that
1:27:34
because they had a backlog of projects.
1:27:36
But then, as they got into implementation, they were not able to reach that.
1:27:39
So, it really started to die in '97-'98, correct?
1:27:44
Right.
1:27:44
Because they were basically, the backlogs that happened before FEMAT.
1:27:49
Right, projects that were already in the works.
1:27:50
On the books, right.
1:27:52
And so, and then you also had
1:27:57
the problems in implementation, some of the things like Survey and
1:28:00
Manage, and just like you said, the NEPA, the reality of NEPA.
1:28:04
Right.
1:28:05
And from what I hear, the AMA's [Adaptive Management Areas] , for
1:28:06
instance, another great idea.
1:28:08
Right.
1:28:09
Basically, laboratories of progressive forestry.
1:28:13
Right.
1:28:14
That the problem was, if you did not have committed people on the ground
1:28:19
in a particular area that were going to stay committed, and then you had
1:28:22
enough people to do whatever it was, they kind of fizzled in a lot of cases.
1:28:28
Right.
1:28:28
Is that a fair way of assessing?
1:28:30
Yeah, and I think, also, it took a long time to get the projects put
1:28:32
on the ground because you had to go through the whole NEPA process.
1:28:34
And if you're doing ground-disturbing activities, you need the
1:28:36
archaeological clearance, you've got to do NEPA, you've got to scope.
1:28:40
You've got to, you know, lay the project out.
1:28:42
And then trying to build in the experimentation piece, we didn't
1:28:44
have a lot of experience with how to lay out replicated management
1:28:48
experiments, in working with managers.
1:28:50
Scientists would go off and do that themselves, but trying to
1:28:52
do it in a management context to test different management options?
1:28:56
Like the Blue River Landscape Plan was one that actually was a fairly
1:29:00
successful adaptive management project.
1:29:04
Right.
1:29:04
But we never did complete the loop of doing the monitoring that was required
1:29:07
so that we can learn from what we did.
1:29:10
And again, I would say part of the reason for the success is the energy
1:29:14
of it being by the H.J. Andrews Forest [Adjacent to Blue River AMA]
1:29:17
. Right.
1:29:18
And with around—
1:29:19
Committed people.
1:29:20
And with committed people in the Willamette Forest and the Blue River
1:29:23
and McKenzie ranger districts, as well.
1:29:25
Right, right.
1:29:26
And John Cissel with BLM, part of that.
1:29:28
So right, and Cissel.
1:29:30
You really depend a lot on that.
1:29:32
Yeah.
1:29:34
Now, what do you remember about?
1:29:35
And there wasn't a lot of funding for the AMA's, either,
1:29:37
so that's part of the problem.
1:29:38
Right.
1:29:38
So what do you remember about the "old guard" in the BLM and Forest Service
1:29:45
dealing with these more difficult, less linear management challenges?
1:29:51
You're in both agencies and you're doing what you're doing in terms
1:29:57
of data and spatial analysis, but still, you're around the office.
1:30:02
Yeah.
1:30:02
And you see people that were used to things going a certain way before the
1:30:09
1990's, and then it’s not going that way anymore and it's much more difficult
1:30:14
to do what maybe they would have felt validated their mission with their agency.
1:30:20
Yeah, I think the whole interagency collaboration piece
1:30:22
was new to a lot of people.
1:30:23
Trying to figure out how to coordinate because it adds a lot more time to
1:30:27
the process, as anything we're doing, the collaboration and coordination
1:30:30
piece, and then, just making sure we're implementing per the Record of Decision.
1:30:34
I think that was new to a lot of managers.
1:30:36
Well, I've got to coordinate with the Forest Service and attend these regional
1:30:39
interagency executive committee meetings.
1:30:41
I've got to attend these intergovernmental, what was it, IAC,
1:30:46
Intergovernmental Advisory Committee, which included tribes and other
1:30:50
agencies and other entities, NGO's that were a part of that kind of advisory
1:30:54
group to the regional executives.
1:30:57
I worked with those same executives on the Columbia Basin, because we
1:31:01
also had an over-arching steering committee over there, so some of
1:31:04
the same people were managing the Columbia Basin project as well.
1:31:07
So, I was hearing and watching and observing what was happening between the
1:31:11
two projects – the implementation of this one and the development of the other.
1:31:15
Those folks really got to know each other very well, but there were a lot of
1:31:17
issues within the realm of consultation and those riparian buffers were one
1:31:22
of the biggest topics of controversy.
1:31:26
This is kind of going back to the Columbia Basin, but I just thought
1:31:30
of something I thought would be interesting; what was the difference in
1:31:34
tribal involvement between the Columbia Basin and the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:31:39
Because the Northwest Forest Plan didn't have a lot of tribal involvement during
1:31:45
the planning, even though they tried to go back with some of the reports and read
1:31:50
the native interests into the monitoring reports and the follow-up reports.
1:31:55
But how did that differ, or was it the same?
1:31:58
We had a whole team of people, actually a team of three or four
1:32:01
people that, on the Columbia Basin project, were our tribal folks.
1:32:05
And there's a whole section in the assessment about tribes
1:32:09
and their values and interests.
1:32:12
We mapped
1:32:16
the ceded lands and what they called Tribal Areas of
1:32:18
Interest by interviewing tribes.
1:32:21
They had a whole tribal component to that.
1:32:24
There were so many tribes in the Columbia Basin to work with, even
1:32:26
more than the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:32:28
They would attend some of our public meetings, and then, the tribal
1:32:30
representatives would go and meet with some of those folks occasionally,
1:32:34
meet with different tribes to talk with them about what we were doing.
1:32:37
There was involvement, but it was kind of on the periphery.
1:32:39
But the BIA, which is not the tribes, they were part of the Northwest Forest
1:32:47
Plan and the Columbia Basin project.
1:32:49
Right.
1:32:49
They were a member, but they weren't really as active as the other agencies.
1:32:55
Okay, so you're getting back involved with the Forest Service and the
1:33:00
monitoring of the Northwest Forest Plan area in 2002-03, correct?
1:33:07
Yes.
1:33:07
Okay.
1:33:08
Now, but going back and speaking to the
1:33:14
monitoring programs and plans for them that came up in the 1990's, please address
1:33:21
them starting with the strategy and design of the effectiveness monitoring
1:33:25
program for the Northwest Forest Plan, using as a foundation for a discussion
1:33:31
of your more direct involvement that happened a few years later.
1:33:34
Sure.
1:33:36
While I was in Walla Walla working on the Columbia Basin project, an interagency
1:33:38
team was putting this together.
1:33:42
Barry Mulder led this team, Tom Spies, Barry Noon, Marty Raphael, some of
1:33:47
the same names you see, Gordie Reeves, and others, were kind of the technical
1:33:51
coordinators of an overall Northwest Forest Plan monitoring strategy.
1:33:57
Right.
1:33:57
So, that's what this document is that came out in 1999.
1:34:02
What it talked about was the different types of things that
1:34:04
were going to be monitored.
1:34:05
Those were spelled out here, but it talked about how you would integrate those things
1:34:09
and how you might do analysis, and how you should consider doing a monitoring
1:34:14
report every five years to report results, learn from those results, and
1:34:19
do this whole adaptive management thing.
1:34:21
It was all tied in to the adaptive management process.
1:34:23
Right.
1:34:23
So, this was kind of a guiding, over-arching idea of a strategy for how
1:34:28
we would integrate all these monitoring modules into a cohesive package.
1:34:36
Then we had individual GTR's [General Technical Report] produced for
1:34:39
each one of the monitoring module protocols that documented what are
1:34:43
the methods, what is the sampling, and how that data would be compiled.
1:34:48
These are our over-arching guiding documents.
1:34:49
We have one for aquatics.
1:34:50
This was the last one done that Gordie Reeves led for effectiveness
1:34:55
monitoring of aquatic and riparian systems, and watershed conditions.
1:34:58
Late-successional old growth, this is one of the early ones that Miles
1:35:01
Hemstrom and Tom Spies put together.
1:35:04
Again, that guides how we address late-successional old growth.
1:35:07
What's the definition?
1:35:09
How does that change the time?
1:35:10
And then we had marbled murrelet and northern spotted owl.
1:35:13
And northern spotted owl monitoring had already been in place, so the scientists
1:35:18
built upon what was already in place.
1:35:20
And Joe Lint, again, from BLM, worked with Forest Service folks and the
1:35:24
USGS, and Robert Anthony, Eric Forsman, Marty Raphael, and a host of others
1:35:28
to develop the over-arching protocol.
1:35:31
We're still following most of this protocol today and it has a
1:35:34
habitat and a population component.
1:35:37
And the same with marbled murrelet.
1:35:39
This one was done, I think, after the northern spotted owl, but there was also
1:35:42
some monitoring already in place and they were able to build the network of
1:35:46
marbled murrelets across all the zones.
1:35:48
And Marty Raphael, if you've interviewed him, I'm sure talked about that.
1:35:51
Yeah.
1:35:52
Basically, they started monitoring some, like the owls, were going on prior to the
1:35:57
signing of the Record of Decision in 1994.
1:36:01
When I came back, we were well into implementation and our first
1:36:05
monitoring report was supposed to cover 1994 through 2003.
1:36:10
We did not do a five-year monitoring report because we were still getting
1:36:13
most of the modules developed and the protocols developed and approved by all
1:36:18
the executives, because the executives had to approve these monitoring
1:36:20
modules because it was interagency.
1:36:22
We'd never done this before.
1:36:23
This was a big-ticket item.
1:36:24
All the scientists kind of finished FEMAT, and then started
1:36:26
working on the monitoring.
1:36:28
That was a big deal to get those all signed, sealed, delivered,
1:36:31
printed and published, and then they began to implement those
1:36:36
in 2003.
1:36:37
It took us a while to finish the first set of reports.
1:36:43
This is the first decade one, right?
1:36:45
The decadal one, yes, because we did not do a five-year report.
1:36:47
I'm going to look for my very first one here.
1:36:49
Well, the five-year, was the research census essentially kind of a “poor
1:36:55
man's” five-year report, if you will?
1:36:56
Well, no, this one is really about the science.
1:36:58
Okay.
1:36:59
So, this is what Richard Haynes pulled together, but ask him.
1:37:03
Speaking about the Northwest Forest Plan research synthesis
1:37:06
1994-1998, for the record.
1:37:10
[Report on desk in room being referenced]
1:37:10
1994 to 1998
1:37:10
Okay.
1:37:12
What Richard Haynes did is he pulled this together.
1:37:14
This is more about the science, not the monitoring.
1:37:16
This is the current state of the science, because when we signed the Record of
1:37:20
Decision, a lot of money came to the Pacific Northwest for implementation.
1:37:24
And the science groups, PSW, PNW [Pacific Southwest and Pacific
1:37:27
Northwest research stations] , well, actually, really PSW got a
1:37:32
lot of money.
1:37:33
So they started trying to fill in some of the data gaps and research needs
1:37:37
that were identified in FEMAT, and in the EIS and Record of Decision.
1:37:42
This basically summarizes what research went on from '94 to '98,
1:37:47
a four-year period, what was some of the key research that occurred.
1:37:51
This is a snapshot in time, kind of a mini-synthesis of this science,
1:37:55
only not the monitoring outputs.
1:37:56
Okay.
1:37:57
The first time we attempted to do that is when we started doing
1:38:01
the individual monitoring plans.
1:38:06
This is, I'm just going to hold up this one, it's a Status and Trends of Northern
1:38:08
Spotted Owl Populations and Habitat.
1:38:10
And that was the 10-year [report after NWFP] , basically?
1:38:10
Ten year, '94 to 2003.
1:38:14
Right.
1:38:14
So, I came back in to play and helped organize how we got the analysis done,
1:38:20
and worked with the scientists to help them get this published, because it
1:38:23
was a team of scientists and managers.
1:38:25
Again, it wasn't just scientists doing the monitoring.
1:38:26
It was a science-management team and they were working on owls,
1:38:30
murrelets, socio and economic, tribal
1:38:38
[issues] . We had these different monitoring modules.
1:38:40
We also tried to do one on biodiversity, but we never
1:38:42
could come up with a protocol.
1:38:43
Bruce Marcot probably talked to you about that.
1:38:46
But this was the first attempt at trying to produce these reports.
1:38:51
You can see the maps in here again.
1:38:53
We had an interagency mapping team, some of the same people producing
1:38:56
the maps that are in these documents.
1:38:58
Some of the same people that worked on FEMAT were doing some of that same work.
1:39:04
But this was the first time we'd done a series of reports like this.
1:39:09
We said, okay, we have these six different monitoring modules, but
1:39:12
what does that tell us about how we're implementing the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:39:17
They said, "Oh, we need a synthesis across the monitoring modules."
1:39:21
And that's what this document is.
1:39:22
John Martin, who was on the management side, was the interagency
1:39:28
monitoring coordinator here.
1:39:29
He worked with Danny Lee, Bernard Bormann, and Richard Haynes, to serve
1:39:35
as technical editors, and a whole host of scientists involved with
1:39:37
these individual monitoring reports.
1:39:39
They worked together to produce this synthesis.
1:39:42
They looked at things like, how well is the Northwest
1:39:46
Forest Plan being implemented?
1:39:47
Are the assumptions made in FEMAT holding true?
1:39:51
How are the reserves functioning?
1:39:55
Are they functioning as intended?
1:39:56
What are some of the issues with adaptive management?
1:39:59
Those were all highlighted here, that adaptive management didn't really work
1:40:02
out the way they thought it might.
1:40:05
And they could already identify that by?
1:40:06
In ten years, yeah.
1:40:08
Yeah, right.
1:40:09
It covers all that and summarizes the state of monitoring for each of the
1:40:13
monitoring modules, and then tries to synthesize across [modules/subjects]
1:40:15
about what this means, and what are the implications for future management.
1:40:23
We organized a two or three-day workshop open to the public and
1:40:28
agency folks, and we rolled out all the science and what's in each of the
1:40:33
monitoring modules in this document.
1:40:35
We had a panel of scientists and a lot of land managers, the BLM Director,
1:40:39
Forest Service Chief; all were speakers.
1:40:42
We had a whole host of folks come together and share the learning.
1:40:45
This was a big-ticket item.
1:40:46
Was that here in Portland?
1:40:47
Yes, it was here in Portland.
1:40:48
So this was a big-ticket item.
1:40:50
I can't remember how many people attended, but I'm going to say 400 or 500 people
1:40:53
might have attended that session.
1:40:54
So, I helped coordinate that.
1:40:56
I helped publish these documents, and helped work across the different teams.
1:41:01
That was kind of my role as part of what they called the Regional
1:41:03
Ecosystem Office, kind of serving as a liaison between the [PNW] Station
1:41:08
and managers on how to use science implement the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:41:13
We worked on that and from that we've were able to publish the 10-year report.
1:41:22
We pulled together the Regional Interagency Executive
1:41:24
Committee right after
1:41:28
that big workshop, and they said, "What did we learn?
1:41:32
What are some action items that we could take?
1:41:33
What is the low-hanging fruit?
1:41:35
What do we need to change in the plan based on what we learned?" They looked
1:41:38
through a series of topics and had the Interagency Advisory Committee, the tribal
1:41:39
folks and the NGO's come together, and had them rank what action items we might take.
1:41:39
The execs did the same thing, and they looked at
1:41:51
how they lined up.
1:41:53
Then, they basically tried to figure out how we take some
1:41:56
of these action items forward.
1:41:58
One of the ones they focused on that I helped lead was the
1:42:00
adaptive management framework.
1:42:02
We developed a white paper based on what happened in the first ten years,
1:42:06
on how do we try to make the adaptive management process work better?
1:42:10
So, we tried to look at that one action item.
1:42:16
There were several action items where we had low-hanging fruit of things we could
1:42:19
maybe change or work together better.
1:42:23
One of them was how do we increase the tribal-federal relationship,
1:42:26
and how do we consult better?
1:42:28
They had a whole series of five-action items they went through, and tried
1:42:31
to learn from what they had done.
1:42:33
So, we worked on that for two or three years.
1:42:35
And then it was time again to do the next series of reports.
1:42:39
Which was fifteen years?
1:42:40
Which was the fifteen.
1:42:42
Right.
1:42:43
Again, some of the players had changed, some of the scientists, as these were
1:42:45
being more led by the managers now.
1:42:48
We hired interagency monitoring coordinators, for example, like the owl
1:42:51
document which was led by Ray Davis, instead of one of our scientists.
1:42:55
But they were working in tandem with a science team.
1:42:58
We did the 10, the 15, and the 20-year report.
1:43:06
Technology changed over time, so sometimes we had to change
1:43:09
the way we looked our data.
1:43:11
We went from one data set to the gradient-nearest-neighbor
1:43:15
vegetation analysis, and used different models to look at habitat.
1:43:19
We had to reset your base line and look through that.
1:43:22
So, we have the 15-year report that went from '94 to 2008, and again, we
1:43:28
did the same series of reports for all the different monitoring modules.
1:43:31
We just had the last one done, for the first twenty years.
1:43:37
For each monitoring module, we had an individual report.
1:43:39
We did not do a synthesis in the 15-year report.
1:43:42
We didn't find the results were that different than in ten.
1:43:46
The owl was still declining, our trends looked similar, and we still
1:43:49
didn't have enough data for some of our monitoring modules like aquatics,
1:43:52
to be able to detect a true trend.
1:43:54
We hadn't gone back and resampled certain areas.
1:43:57
So, in the 20-year report we were able to make more firm statements about trends,
1:44:02
particularly for the marbled murrelet.
1:44:05
Which is a hard bird to track?
1:44:07
Exactly.
1:44:08
And it's a very mysterious bird that goes way up in the trees.
1:44:12
Right.
1:44:12
But then, the technology changed again.
1:44:14
We used a little bit different tools and different data, but not really different
1:44:19
data, but just different tools in the way we analyzed the information that we
1:44:22
had to produce this series of reports.
1:44:26
The twenty?
1:44:26
The 20-year reports.
1:44:28
We did not do a synthesis there, but we talked about setting up a synthesis which
1:44:32
I'm working on now, the “Northwest Forest Plan Science Synthesis,” that basically
1:44:36
is a summary across the monitoring modules for like the first ten years.
1:44:40
It's also looking at the state of the science for a variety of
1:44:45
management questions that were developed by managers about
1:44:51
the major issues we have under the new 2012 planning rule that we
1:44:55
need to have informed by science.
1:44:57
So, what are the broad-scale issues that we need to think about as we move
1:45:01
forward with land management planning in the Northwest Forest Plan area?
1:45:05
There's a set of questions that teed up this science synthesis.
1:45:08
It's more focused on Forest Service lands because BLM has already gone
1:45:11
through their forest plan revisions.
1:45:13
But it also covers their lands.
1:45:15
And so, we're working on that now to help set up future forest plan
1:45:21
revisions in Region 5 and Region 6 of the Forest Service, in Oregon,
1:45:24
Washington and northern California.
1:45:26
There are plans and talk of trying to do a bio-regional assessment that
1:45:30
would look at these broad, overarching issues like owls and murrelets,
1:45:35
late-successional old growth, how do we manage those, what things need to be
1:45:39
changed from the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:45:40
Look at what's still working and what needs to be changed, and
1:45:44
come up with a need for change.
1:45:46
Then they would move into traditional forest planning under the new planning
1:45:51
rules, which has an assessment phase.
1:45:52
They would do a pre-assessment, or what they call bioregional assessment, then
1:45:56
an assessment, and then they would do individual EIS's for groups of forests.
1:46:01
They're still talking about that whole process.
1:46:03
So, any reassessments or implementations of new plans or
1:46:07
developments of new plans, would have to take place at the forest level?
1:46:11
Well, there are groups of [national] forests.
1:46:13
Right now, under the new 2012 planning rule,
1:46:17
the line officers, basically the forest supervisors, are the responsible
1:46:22
officials under this new planning rule.
1:46:25
Since the new planning rule of 2012 has different requirements,
1:46:28
there's a lot more collaboration.
1:46:30
So, it's building upon what we did in Northwest Forest Plan.
1:46:32
It's a lot of collaboration, and there are a lot of new standards.
1:46:36
Not standards and guides, but more a new manual and directives that have to be
1:46:41
followed that are very specific about
1:46:45
ecological and social parameters that need to be considered.
1:46:49
There's a tribal component.
1:46:50
There are ecosystems services and climate change, which were not part of
1:46:54
the Northwest Forest Plan, which are now an integral part of the planning rule.
1:46:58
So, there's some new things that are being considered.
1:47:00
That's why this synthesis will look different than what was in the 10-year
1:47:03
because it was really focused on the monitoring, and this is the current
1:47:07
state of the science to inform planning under the new 2012 planning rule.
1:47:11
What has changed the most or what are a couple factors that have changed the most
1:47:15
in how this is being viewed and planned for from the 10 to the 20 year point?
1:47:21
What are some dramatic or very poignant examples?
1:47:25
I would say that the technology has changed with respect
1:47:28
to what tools we're using.
1:47:29
We're using different models to analyze habitat.
1:47:32
So, just the tools and the technology.
1:47:35
But what we're doing in the 20-year synthesis is really a synthesis
1:47:39
of the available science, so it has to be peer-reviewed science.
1:47:43
We're being very robust about that.
1:47:44
It's not just information in the file cabinets and other data.
1:47:48
It has to be peer-reviewed science.
1:47:50
Like the FEMAT?
1:47:50
Like the original FEMAT.
1:47:52
But again, we're not doing alternatives, we're just doing a state of the science
1:47:56
for a set of specific management questions to inform future planners’ visions.
1:48:00
It's very focused, even though it's got a lot of questions.
1:48:02
We started out with over 200 management questions, and there's
1:48:06
now like, 64 or 75 management questions we're using to inform us.
1:48:13
We have twelve chapters in that document and it's quite large.
1:48:17
It's going to end up being two volumes, kind of like the Sierra Nevada Assessment
1:48:21
[Forest Service 2013 interdisciplinary analysis of greater Sierra Nevada
1:48:21
bioregion] , and with an executive summary that will be the layperson's
1:48:24
version of what are the key findings that managers can use to inform.
1:48:30
And so the public can also understand, the executive summary will aim to do that.
1:48:36
We've been through the peer-review process and now we're moving into the
1:48:39
policy review of certain chapters.
1:48:41
And we're trying to get this document ready for a release next
1:48:43
spring, we hope, knock on wood.
1:48:45
That's the research?
1:48:49
Basically, the Northwest Forest Plan Science Synthesis.
1:48:52
Science synthesis.
1:48:52
To inform land management for future forest planning in the
1:48:56
Northwest Forest Plan area.
1:48:57
But now, the managers are definitely more involved with this?
1:49:02
No, this is a science project.
1:49:03
It's just science again, okay.
1:49:05
It's science again.
1:49:05
It's science doing a summary of the science.
1:49:07
But are they?
1:49:08
They formed, the developed the questions that we guide the synthesis.
1:49:12
And we are constantly, we have--
1:49:13
So, the managers were involved on the front end in terms of
1:49:16
framing the project, okay.
1:49:17
Framing the questions and the scope.
1:49:19
What we had was a set of planning team members in Region 5 that I liaison
1:49:26
with, and we have our executives.
1:49:28
We meet monthly, PSW, PNW, Region 5 and Region 6, to discuss where
1:49:34
we are with the synthesis, how's it going, what are the issues and
1:49:37
we resolve those as we move along.
1:49:39
Then we also coordinate back up to the regional interagency executive
1:49:42
committee, because this is related to Northwest Forest Plan and it's more
1:49:45
focused on the Forest Service side.
1:49:47
But it does impact other agencies, as there are a lot of interests.
1:49:49
So, we coordinated and reported back to those groups, and also another group
1:49:53
was formed called the “senior managers group.” That's the implementation arm
1:49:56
of the Regional Interagency Executive Committee. That's a new group that was
1:50:00
established after the Record of Decision to help implementation after the REO,
1:50:05
or Regional Ecosystem Office, became virtual and was just scaled to a handful
1:50:10
of people. We set up the “senior managers group” to deal with implementation issues.
1:50:14
So, we're still working with both of those groups as we work on the synthesis.
1:50:21
So, again, it's a separate exercise kind of like the “Pink Tower, but it's
1:50:25
really just a state of the science.
1:50:26
They're not looking at options and scenarios.
1:50:29
That would be another.
1:50:30
Right, so they're staying very much on the science side, and they're not
1:50:33
crossing over into the policy arena.
1:50:36
We're not even making management recommendations.
1:50:38
We have management considerations and key implications that we're teeing up
1:50:43
for managers to them take from us and work on the bioregional assessment and
1:50:47
pull that into forest plan revisions.
1:50:49
Is there pressure from certain outside interest groups to open
1:50:52
up the whole process again?
1:50:55
Well, there's a lot of folks that don't want to.
1:50:58
As part of trying to figure out where to go with forest plan revisions,
1:51:03
Region 5 and Region 6, held listening sessions back in, I'm going to
1:51:06
say in 2015, with the public.
1:51:07
And they went all around Oregon and Washington and California.
1:51:12
And our science team, our scientists, were involved with that, and our
1:51:15
program managers were trying to find out from the public what their interests
1:51:19
were in the communications realm, the science realm, and also management.
1:51:24
How they wanted to see forest management done in the future.
1:51:26
They've got a lot of input there that helped inform what some of the
1:51:29
questions were for the synthesis.
1:51:33
They interacted with the public there, and so they've been watching
1:51:36
and following this synthesis project.
1:51:38
And then, there's been opportunities because it is a highly influential
1:51:42
science document under the Office of Management and Budget [U.S.]
1:51:45
guidelines, data quality and all of that.
1:51:49
Basically, it's highly influential.
1:51:51
There's different stages where the public needs to be engaged.
1:51:53
We have a website where we keep people informed on our status.
1:51:57
We mentioned all this work that was going to happen when
1:51:59
we had the listening sessions.
1:52:01
We started planning that process then, and now, we keep reporting
1:52:06
back to those same folks and post new information on our website.
1:52:12
When we started the peer-review process, we also opened it up to the public.
1:52:15
We made those documents, which we normally don't do.
1:52:19
We usually keep them private and not share with the public until
1:52:23
we finish our peer-review process.
1:52:24
Right.
1:52:24
And we contracted the Ecological Society of America to run a separate review
1:52:29
process, so that they were running it, and we were not picking the reviewers.
1:52:32
There's a lot of guidelines about not using any scientists
1:52:35
that have been involved with the process, or no Forest Service or
1:52:37
USDA agencies could be included.
1:52:43
They ran that process, picked the reviewers, paid
1:52:48
them and that kind of thing.
1:52:48
We paid for that review.
1:52:50
But during that process, there also had to be a public input process,
1:52:53
so we had to allow the public to look at the science information.
1:52:57
We held a public forum where they could all come in and make public statements.
1:53:02
And that was a huge, big webinar that was webcast across the whole Northwest
1:53:05
Forest Plan area, and each of our forest supervisors’ offices had a satellite
1:53:10
location where folks could make comments.
1:53:12
Then people had an opportunity to provide comments for, I think,
1:53:15
over a two- or three-month period.
1:53:16
This was 2015, correct?
1:53:18
No, this was 2016.
1:53:19
'16, okay.
1:53:21
We actually had been working on the science synthesis since the end of 2015.
1:53:29
But we allowed the public to make those comments and they were captured, either
1:53:32
orally, another contractor captured the oral comments and written comments.
1:53:36
We had over 800 pages of public input that were then posted to the web and made
1:53:41
available to the peer reviewers that the Ecological Society of America had hired.
1:53:44
And they considered that, because it was supposed to be about the science,
1:53:47
and there was a lot of public values and other things that were not true science.
1:53:52
So, each of the peer reviewers looked at that and considered it in their own way.
1:53:56
Some of those public comments then became part of their peer review comments
1:54:00
that then came back to our scientists.
1:54:03
Our scientists are now revising their chapters based on the peer-review process,
1:54:07
and some of that has public input.
1:54:09
Then they're reconciling to those peer-review comments, and then
1:54:12
we'll move into policy review in the two stations before that
1:54:16
document is put into the editing process to create these hard copies.
1:54:21
Okay.
1:54:22
It's an involved process.
1:54:25
Continue along the path you were, talking about the synthesis, and specifically
1:54:30
about how you have seen this process enable managers and scientists to
1:54:39
work together, talk together, find out what they need to do better?
1:54:45
Okay.
1:54:46
Because you've been of an overseer of all these projects, documents and
1:54:51
processes, I think you can give an overarching outside view-point on
1:55:00
that.
1:55:00
When we did the FEMAT report, it was one of the first times we had
1:55:04
to work together interagency-wise.
1:55:07
Then scientists and managers were actually talking together more, but
1:55:10
there were two separate processes.
1:55:11
When we finished FEMAT and they moved into the EIS stage, they had
1:55:14
to talk to each other about what did you really mean in FEMAT, how that
1:55:19
would work with implementation, and how do we turn that into standards
1:55:21
and guidelines, that kind of thing.
1:55:22
They started working together then and creating a bond.
1:55:25
Then, we had these different overarching organizational groups that were set
1:55:30
up in the Record of Decision, most of which are still in place today, like the
1:55:35
Regional Interagency Executive Committee and the Regional Ecosystem Office.
1:55:39
Those are interagency coordinating entities that have continued on for the
1:55:42
last 22 years, and they're still in place.
1:55:44
I think that helps us continue.
1:55:46
We come together every month in what we call the “senior managers group.” That's
1:55:49
where we talk about issues with Northwest Forest Plan monitoring and the synthesis.
1:55:55
All the agencies that signed this Record of Decision are invited to participate.
1:55:59
I think we have everybody but the Corps of Engineers.
1:56:01
BIA even is back participating, but we don't have NRCS at the table very often.
1:56:05
But the rest of the agencies do participate and are active
1:56:08
members of both of those groups.
1:56:10
So, I see that we continue to work together and we try to listen to
1:56:13
what the managers are wanting.
1:56:14
Part of my role as a liaison between the scientists and managers is to try to make
1:56:18
those connections and make sure that the managers and the scientists are talking,
1:56:21
and that the stations [PNW/PSW] bring the right scientists to the table when
1:56:25
managers need to have those interactions.
1:56:27
We also have, between the Forest Service, the PSW,
1:56:34
PNW, Region 5 and Region 6, monthly meetings to talk about the synthesis
1:56:38
and the bioregional assessment.
1:56:39
There's two different meetings that happen each month so that we can continue
1:56:41
to work together and figure out what our staffs need to do together, and
1:56:45
what we need to do together as managers or executives to try to coordinate
1:56:49
and better develop this synthesis.
1:56:52
So it's not a product that's just
1:56:56
useful to managers, but that it's steered to what the managers need
1:57:00
in order to move forward with forest planning in the Northwest Forest
1:57:04
Plan area for the Forest Service.
1:57:05
Now, do you think in the immediate aftermath of FEMAT that there was
1:57:09
some resentment from the managers, that they were kind of left out?
1:57:13
Yes, there was.
1:57:15
Not being allowed in the Pink Tower.
1:57:18
Cindy and others talked to you, that managers had to wear like
1:57:21
an orange vest or something.
1:57:22
Like a traffic vest.
1:57:23
Yes, so when they walked in, so that you'd know, oh, that's
1:57:25
a manager, not a scientist.
1:57:28
That's just the way it was set up.
1:57:29
They put kind of science in a different place than we are now.
1:57:32
We don't normally sit down and develop options and make
1:57:36
management recommendations.
1:57:37
We're more [focused] on summarizing the state of the science and teeing
1:57:42
up what management considerations might be for forest plan revisions.
1:57:48
Like in the synthesis, we are not analyzing alternatives or options,
1:57:54
but we are making statements about the different viewpoints in the
1:57:57
science, so that they also know there's agreement on these types of issues,
1:58:01
but there may be disagreement on how to manage like, riparian buffers.
1:58:05
That's still an issue, a long-running issue.
1:58:08
There's differing viewpoints in the science about that and about downed wood,
1:58:11
how much is needed in streams, etc., etc. Scientists have different viewpoints.
1:58:15
We're teeing those up for the managers, so they know all the differing viewpoints
1:58:18
and they can make a decision when they move into forest plan revision
1:58:21
on where they want to land with management and they know the pro's and
1:58:24
con's and the uncertainty and risk.
1:58:26
Have you seen a change from managers in this twenty years,
1:58:30
from maybe a little resentment, grudging acceptance, to eventual…..?
1:58:37
Partnerships.
1:58:37
Partnerships.
1:58:38
Yeah, I think we have a lot better science-management partnership,
1:58:40
particularly, Region 6 in PNW.
1:58:43
We have a lot of scientists like Bruce Marcot, who have spent their whole career
1:58:46
working hand-in-hand with managers, helping them develop data and tools, and
1:58:51
writing GTR's for them, synthesizing other aspects, and modeling species viability.
1:58:58
So, we do a lot of support in the station for managers like we've done
1:59:01
that for the last 25 years, just how to use these tools, EMDS [Ecosystem
1:59:06
Management Decision Support system] and other tools that we've developed.
1:59:08
We're helping managers use those on a daily basis.
1:59:11
So, it is a partnership.
1:59:12
And I think it could be stronger, because there are not as many
1:59:15
scientists as we used to have.
1:59:16
We don't have as much funding.
1:59:18
And we don't have as many people to interact with the managers.
1:59:20
But also, there are a lot of Ph.D.'s on the management side, and they're
1:59:27
staying abreast of the science.
1:59:28
They form partnerships with scientists in universities and
1:59:32
other agencies, and the stations.
1:59:34
So, it is a nice network that we have in place.
1:59:37
And I'd say it's also probably a function of generational shifts,
1:59:43
you know, the “old guard” of the "get out the cut" forest people.
1:59:46
They're gone.
1:59:47
They're gone.
1:59:48
Right.
1:59:48
And also, training in universities, for instance, is more ecosystem
1:59:54
science oriented, even if they are in a mainstream forestry track.
1:59:59
Right.
2:00:00
It's more, I guess, progressive forestry.
2:00:03
Progressive, and with “New Forestry” methods.
2:00:03
[Term used by Jerry Franklin to describe ecosystem-oriented management methods.]
2:00:04
New Forestry techniques.
2:00:05
And so, it would be included.
2:00:07
Just the people are coming out, it's not just a matter of people accepting,
2:00:11
“Oh, well, that's the way it is now,” so I accept that because I need my job.
2:00:15
It's also just generational paradigm shifts in terms of
2:00:20
who's coming in, a younger crew.
2:00:23
The old industrial timber people who gained so much of their
2:00:27
identity in that kind of a role; those people aren't around anymore.
2:00:32
People have redefined what it is to be a manager in the Forest Service and BLM.
2:00:36
Right.
2:00:36
Would that be a correct way to describe these changes?
2:00:38
Yes, I think so.
2:00:39
Before it used to be like our wildlife biologists.
2:00:41
All they really knew about was wildlife ecology, and they didn't
2:00:44
really dabble in these other fields and look at whole ecosystems.
2:00:48
But now, people are coming out of school with a different background.
2:00:50
It's more integrated.
2:00:52
Folks have a different set of skills when they come to the Forest Service and BLM
2:00:56
and research, and they're usually more interested in the holistic management
2:01:00
of all lands, and looking at the ecosystem versus just one aspect of it.
2:01:06
How have you seen industry react to the Forest Plan in your twenty years in terms
2:01:14
of being involved, not being involved?
2:01:17
There's litigation, there's public hearings, there's all
2:01:20
kinds of different interactions.
2:01:22
Right.
2:01:22
How have you seen that change, stay the same, what have you?
2:01:26
Again, this is just on the periphery.
2:01:30
When we finished FEMAT and they did the Northwest Forest Plan, there
2:01:34
were people that loved it and there were people that didn't like it.
2:01:36
And those people still exist in those same non-governmental
2:01:39
organizations, still have a lot of the same feelings they did back then.
2:01:42
There are a lot of them that liked the way that the Northwest Forest Plan
2:01:45
has been implemented, because it's not really implemented as written,
2:01:48
because certain things couldn't be implemented the way they were written.
2:01:53
Some people like it the way it's been implemented, and some people
2:01:56
like it the way it was written, or some people don't like it at all.
2:01:59
So, we heard a lot of that during the listening sessions that Forest
2:02:01
Service had, Region 5 and Region 6, before they started thinking
2:02:04
about Forest Plan revision.
2:02:06
There are still people on all sides of the fence.
2:02:08
And industry is one, like the O&C counties.
2:02:11
They came and made comments about the Northwest Forest Plan science synthesis
2:02:15
and tried to challenge some of the content there because they have a different spin
2:02:20
and different interest with the O&C lands.
2:02:22
Right.
2:02:24
Some of those same groups are still there.
2:02:25
I think we really haven't changed places.
2:02:28
I mean, there hasn't been much more acceptance.
2:02:30
But again, I don't think a lot of people want to see Northwest Forest
2:02:32
Plan opened up and modified, because they're comfortable with the content.
2:02:37
They know at least what it is.
2:02:44
They say, not to disembowel the Northwest Forest Plan, but basically tear apart
2:02:47
the fabric of the Northwest Forest Plan and late-successional old growth
2:02:51
strategy and all associated species.
2:02:53
They're afraid that we're going to piecemeal it by doing individual forest
2:02:56
plans, that we're not going to look at it cohesively across the whole
2:03:00
landscape like it was designed, as a network of late-successional reserves.
2:03:04
How are we going to manage that in the future?
2:03:05
So, there's a lot of controversy around that.
2:03:07
Yeah, I think some of the traditional communities are still living in the
2:03:12
old mythology of the clearcutting days.
2:03:14
And they're like, for instance, with this new administration and dramatic change
2:03:19
in philosophy, they're saying, it's going to bring back clearcutting again.
2:03:24
Right.
2:03:25
Right, right.
2:03:25
We can change all this.
2:03:26
But that's very difficult to turn something around with that much momentum.
2:03:31
Right, because you have land use allocations that would have to
2:03:33
be modified in order to produce more timber, and you have to deal
2:03:36
with the Endangered Species Act.
2:03:40
So, we've got consultation and biological opinions that are in place that would have
2:03:44
to all be modified in order to change land use allocations and change these reserves,
2:03:49
or do forest plan revisions that can also change those allocations and maybe
2:03:53
open up some areas for timber harvest.
2:03:55
But we're finding that there's so much controversy about harvesting old trees,
2:03:59
even without a late-successional reserve, we're still going to have difficulty
2:04:03
getting more cut out, I think, that some of the industry would like to see.
2:04:07
And, the mill structure is not there.
2:04:10
Richard Haynes talked to you about that.
2:04:12
Well, I mean, in 20-25 years, and even before the forest plan, the
2:04:17
economics, especially the smaller mills, was already changing.
2:04:23
Right, right.
2:04:24
Whether because of--
2:04:25
By the time we finished this report, yes.
2:04:26
Yeah, well, really by the '80s.
2:04:31
Right.
2:04:31
You know, whether it be international pressures and market prices,
2:04:35
whether it has to do with just the systems of a developing American
2:04:39
economy in the Northwest in that context, forces were changing.
2:04:45
So, I think for some people, the forest plan and the environmentalists and all
2:04:49
that stuff, are a convenient target to not look at the more complex picture.
2:04:55
But I understand the feelings.
2:05:00
The guy that's building a house next to my family home in Eugene; he's a builder
2:05:06
now, but I remember we were talking about something about my job at Oregon
2:05:10
State, and he said, "Oh, I'm building now because of the god-dang owl."
2:05:15
Right.
2:05:15
You know, "My family was in logging for 75 years." And so-on.
2:05:19
Right.
2:05:19
And he's a nice guy, but that's the reductionist simple viewpoint
2:05:25
that a lot of people still have.
2:05:27
Right.
2:05:28
You know, like the owl was to blame for everything.
2:05:32
It's a convenient symbol, and I understand the frustration.
2:05:35
But I think it still exists, though, honestly.
2:05:38
Yeah.
2:05:39
Because the letters that we get for the Northwest Forest Plan Science Synthesis,
2:05:45
suggesting the way we should be approaching things and just some
2:05:48
of the issues they're raising.
2:05:49
They just have their own opinions and they're going to stick with those,
2:05:52
no matter what the science says.
2:05:54
Right.
2:05:55
So, if you were going to talk about just some of the big areas in the plan, the
2:06:01
late-successional reserves, the owl, any of the big indicators which you
2:06:07
could synopsize into a brief statement, how would you characterize where
2:06:12
things are now from what you have done?
2:06:14
You're a synthesizer, so I think your opinion definitely
2:06:18
has weight in this area.
2:06:20
If you were going to say, the late-successional reserves have shown
2:06:25
this kind of progress over 20 years or 25 years, and the same for the owl.
2:06:30
If you can kind of just go through a couple of those points.
2:06:32
I can give you what the observations are that our scientists have made.
2:06:33
Yes.
2:06:33
Again, I'm not one of the scientists like Tom Spies, who
2:06:36
could spout these off to you.
2:06:37
Right.
2:06:38
But in the late-successional reserves, we found in the 10-year report that they
2:06:43
appeared to be functioning as intended.
2:06:46
And then here in the 20-year report, we're seeing that there needs to be
2:06:51
some flexibility perhaps, in how those late-successional reserves are managed
2:06:57
where you have fire-prone systems.
2:06:58
You need to be planning ahead about what are
2:07:02
you going to do when you lose some of those systems to large disturbance
2:07:07
events like the Biscuit Fire [500,000 acres/S.Ore/N.Cal/in 2002] . What
2:07:10
are areas are there for recruitment?
2:07:11
And so, be thinking about those things.
2:07:13
And some of those kinds of findings are in the latest critical
2:07:18
habitat for the spotted owl.
2:07:20
That information has been kind of folded into that plan.
2:07:24
And so, our scientists have cooperated with managers in
2:07:27
looking at the reserve network.
2:07:28
So, there might be flexibility that managers can consider on fire-prone
2:07:33
forests versus the wet forests in the late-successional reserves.
2:07:35
You mean, in other words, thinning-type activities, for
2:07:39
instance, to reduce fuel loads?
2:07:43
Right, to very much, fuel loadings, yes, yes.
2:07:43
Right, okay.
2:07:44
Because you might manage reserves differently or maybe even have a different
2:07:50
set of them in certain areas, or actually manage through time.
2:07:53
So, some of that is pulled into the critical habitat, and the whole plan.
2:08:00
The owl populations are continuing to decline.
2:08:03
We're seeing now that a lot of it might be likely be due to the barred owl presence.
2:08:08
And we're doing that barred owl experimental removal.
2:08:11
The [U.S.] Fish and Wildlife Service is leading that, and of other
2:08:13
agencies, USGS is a primary player, and we're cooperating on that.
2:08:17
And we're helping to fund that to test what does that do to
2:08:20
the [spotted] owl's population.
2:08:22
So, there's a lot of science coming out on that.
2:08:24
The barred owls play a critical role in helping to reduce owl populations,
2:08:29
it appears, in the science from what our scientists are saying.
2:08:31
Well, they're a generalist, who seems to be--
2:08:33
Yes, who takes advantage?
2:08:35
Who seems to do better than the northern spotted owl, which doesn't
2:08:39
seem to do well when they have to face a changed environment or habitat.
2:08:44
Right.
2:08:44
As well as the general.
2:08:45
It's just, this is an old ecological equation.
2:08:48
Right, so for m arbled murrelet there's still a declining trend, but it's not
2:08:54
necessarily management of the national forests and the BLM that is causing that.
2:08:59
It's probably more of the interior private lands.
2:09:01
It's just they're not really sure what's causing, at least from
2:09:04
what Marty [Raphael] has told us.
2:09:06
It
2:09:09
might be
2:09:11
having to do with the oceans and climate change is one other thing.
2:09:16
They don't know how that's affecting the marbled murrelet.
2:09:19
They're still trying to do habitat modeling on that.
2:09:21
So, they're
2:09:24
just finally able to say they have a trend, a declining trend now.
2:09:26
They have enough data and the statistical power to say that.
2:09:30
So, they're continuing to look at that.
2:09:31
They can't make as many firm statements there.
2:09:36
When we get to the 25-year report we'll have a lot more information on status
2:09:41
and trends for aquatic and riparian.
2:09:43
In this summer's field season they'll actually be revisiting
2:09:48
some of the earlier sites where they collected in-stream samples.
2:09:50
And so, they'll be able to make some inference and have more
2:09:54
statistical trends they can report.
2:09:57
Right now, it appears that
2:10:00
the status and condition of watersheds are improving in certain areas, and in
2:10:04
certain areas it's declining, but they’re seeing an upward trend in many areas.
2:10:08
But they will be able to say that with more rigor after this field season, and
2:10:11
we're working with some other scientists, Rebecca Flickcroft, and Jason Dunham,
2:10:15
to try to look at and tease out that information after this field season of
2:10:18
data to prep us for the 25-year report.
2:10:20
Yeah, because 20 or 25 years in the big scheme of things
2:10:23
in science is not that long.
2:10:25
Right.
2:10:25
In terms of providing evidence.
2:10:27
You can make inferences, it’s evidence, but
2:10:35
a human generation is a statement, is what I'm talking about.
2:10:37
Right.
2:10:37
So, yeah, that's true.
2:10:38
Then for late-successional reserves, the late-successional o ld growth
2:10:42
monitoring shows there's not a drastic difference in how much late-
2:10:47
successional old growth there is.
2:10:48
It's been changing over time, but there's still a lot [to know]
2:10:52
. We're still short on early seral.
2:10:55
Some of the early seral stages are not quite where they used to be.
2:10:59
And of course, we have a different trajectory potentially with
2:11:02
climate change, that kind of thing.
2:11:04
But the large disturbance events, that's something we're able
2:11:06
to now tease out of the data.
2:11:08
In the early days, we couldn't really tell what was causing the loss.
2:11:12
And it wasn't really timber harvest.
2:11:14
What they've been able to tease out of the GNN data now is that it's been
2:11:18
these large disturbance events like the Biscuit Fire and others that are
2:11:21
helping with the loss of old growth.
2:11:24
We see conditions improving there, but it's slow.
2:11:26
It's a 100-year plan, and we're only in year 22, 23, of a 100-year
2:11:32
plan, so it's going to take a while.
2:11:34
So, that late-successional old growth trends seem to be improving,
2:11:38
and you can read more specifics on that in the 20-year report.
2:11:42
And then social and economic, one of the biggest criticisms that we've had in
2:11:46
the 10-year report, they actually tried to get at community level information.
2:11:52
They summarized some of the synthesis information and some of the outputs
2:11:56
of timber production, grazing and receipts to the county level, and
2:12:01
reported it to the whole region.
2:12:04
They didn't have a lot of community level data.
2:12:06
But what they did is they went out and did some interviews and some case studies.
2:12:11
We backed off that in the 15-year report because managers felt they
2:12:15
couldn't extrapolate that information.
2:12:17
It was very expensive and they felt they couldn't afford it.
2:12:20
They got heavily criticized after the 20-year report, about
2:12:24
well, why did you drop this?
2:12:26
You can't tell us anything that's happening at the community level.
2:12:29
What we've actually done now is we've been working with managers through
2:12:31
the Regional Interagency Executive Committee meetings, and we've cobbled
2:12:36
together funding across all agencies.
2:12:38
Most agencies did contribute, and we're going to try to add that component
2:12:41
back in and do a community typology for the 25-year report where we look at
2:12:46
similar communities and do a typology analysis working with Cass Moseley [Univ.
2:12:50
of Oregon social science professor] , and others.
2:12:53
And also, go back and do some of those same case studies and maybe some
2:12:55
others, maybe do ten case studies.
2:12:57
And also, summarize some of the census information down to the county level,
2:13:01
instead of just reporting it regionally.
2:13:03
And also, the same with our outputs.
2:13:06
We can report them to the county level instead of just regionally.
2:13:09
So, we're trying to take the information down to this finer resolution where we
2:13:13
can to provide more [details/analysis]
2:13:14
. When you're taking about case studies, for example, you'd be talking about,
2:13:19
ten different types of communities.
2:13:22
Right.
2:13:22
In different classes and sizes?
2:13:25
Right, in different typologies.
2:13:25
In Washington and Oregon and northern California?
2:13:28
Right.
2:13:28
That represent different--
2:13:30
Right.
2:13:30
And different outcomes, too, in terms of how they've survived, or not done well?
2:13:34
Right, and then do a series of interviews.
2:13:35
Right, right.
2:13:36
So there will be similar case studies.
2:13:37
It will be more rapid than what was done in the 10-year [report] , but
2:13:40
we're working with quite a few folks to pull that together.
2:13:43
That's something we're just starting working on this fall in
2:13:46
preparation for the 25-year report.
2:13:48
We're trying to augment and beef up the community piece, because we
2:13:51
realize that's what people care about.
2:13:52
They want to know the cause-and-effect of what
2:13:55
management of the forest is doing to these communities.
2:13:57
What can we say about that?
2:13:58
How are these communities changing over time?
2:14:02
Having that information, we can at least [assess] these communities.
2:14:06
We only interviewed in these ten communities, but based on our typology
2:14:10
are similar, you can assume from these communities, similar outputs
2:14:13
or outcomes [for other communities of their type] . At least people can
2:14:15
see, well, [my community is somewhat] similar to this [sampled] community.
2:14:16
Okay, that makes sense.
2:14:18
Whereas before, they couldn't see that.
2:14:19
When you look at things at a county level, they felt that
2:14:21
their information was being lost.
2:14:23
People didn't see the real effect on the communities.
2:14:25
We've been criticized for that.
2:14:27
Well, the problem is, too, for instance, I live in Lane County.
2:14:30
Right.
2:14:31
Well, Eugene's a big town.
2:14:33
Great.
2:14:33
And it's got the university and it's insulated from certain things, even
2:14:37
though its timber economy has dramatically dropped off since the hey-days of the
2:14:43
'40s and '50s before I was growing up.
2:14:46
And it's changed, but that is a big city.
2:14:50
But you take Lane County as a whole, which is Florence to the Cascade
2:14:53
crest, those smaller communities could be lost in the wash of numbers
2:14:59
extrapolated over a big area.
2:15:01
Right, exactly.
2:15:01
Because it hides little desperate niches along the Santiam River, which
2:15:06
is actually Linn County, but on the McKenzie and Willamette River, too.
2:15:12
It hides the pain of those communities in statistics.
2:15:15
Exactly.
2:15:15
In abstractions.
2:15:16
Yeah, and that's one of the biggest things we've heard from the public
2:15:19
and from different groups is that they'd like to see more information
2:15:23
being compiled that way, and to be used in forest plan revisions.
2:15:26
So, we're compiling this information knowing it would be used in forest
2:15:29
plan revisions as well, and not just for Northwest Forest Plan monitoring.
2:15:31
The same data sets and information can feed into that process.
2:15:36
When I was preparing for this project, and reading the literature
2:15:41
and the results, that is the one thing I could see immediately, that
2:15:46
this forest plan was going to cause serious pain in local communities.
2:15:51
And it seemed to be, and I don't want to say dismissed, because I don't
2:15:54
think that's fair, but I think it was downplayed, or not prioritized.
2:16:00
And I think there was a little bit of hopeful naivete or hopeful optimism,
2:16:04
that you could say was a little bit naïve about how it would actually work out in
2:16:10
real time, when you would look at how the power structures of politics were working
2:16:15
out, the impact of environmental activism and litigation, the decline of timber….
2:16:22
Right.
2:16:22
Already in terms of its political power locally, but even higher up.
2:16:28
I could see that playing out myself.
2:16:31
And I don't know if a lot of people saw that coming until after it played out.
2:16:37
Right, right.
2:16:38
Because investing in something, and this was a great effort,
2:16:42
this was a noble effort.
2:16:43
But I think sometimes, people get into that tunnel thinking.
2:16:47
Right.
2:16:48
And then, all of a sudden, things unfold in a different way.
2:16:51
Right, we never have been able to deliver the amount of timber that was predicted in
2:16:57
FEMAT and the EIS and Record of Decision.
2:17:02
A big criticism is that we were unable to get what we needed off the Matrix lands.
2:17:06
And that's why I was looking at that.
2:17:10
Being a historian, I look at how things are historically, and I said, "I could
2:17:14
see this coming." If I had looked at this, I would have seen that coming, and
2:17:21
this is not a criticism, it's an observation.
2:17:23
Oh, yeah, yeah.
2:17:23
Because I understand where it came from, because really, in a lot of ways,
2:17:28
this was part of the pendulum swing in opposition to industrial forestry's abuses
2:17:32
of the land over many, many decades.
2:17:35
So, society comes back and swings again, the pendulum goes that way.
2:17:40
So, it's an observation, a historian's observation, for what it's worth.
2:17:46
Yeah.
2:17:47
So, talk
2:17:53
to me about climate change?
2:17:54
You've been the climate change coordinator, correct?
2:18:00
For Region 6.
2:18:00
For Region 6.
2:18:01
Since 2012.
2:18:03
2012.
2:18:04
Part-time, it's part-time duty.
2:18:05
Collateral duty.
2:18:05
Okay.
2:18:07
And tell me about what you do, and kind of read that back into
2:18:12
the forest plan, that the various aspects we've been talking about.
2:18:17
Okay.
2:18:17
Just kind of go where you want to go with it.
2:18:19
Okay, I'll go fairly quickly.
2:18:22
The Forest Service has a climate change road map that was
2:18:26
recently developed – in 2010.
2:18:28
From that, they developed a climate change scorecard, basically, a
2:18:32
set of ten different areas you would be held accountable for.
2:18:36
Each forest in the National Forest System reported annually from
2:18:39
2010 to 2015, and actually through 2016, about how they were doing.
2:18:43
They had to answer yes or no questions.
2:18:45
The goal was to have seven out of ten yes answers by 2015, to show that
2:18:49
we were actually integrating climate change into our programs of work and
2:18:53
our daily work on the ground, with planning and at the project level.
2:18:57
I've been working with the forests to try to help them answer those scorecard
2:19:01
questions, and to help develop what we call Climate Change Vulnerability
2:19:04
Assessments across the region.
2:19:05
So, we're working again, a science-management partnership with
2:19:08
PNW and the Rocky Mountain Research Station, and a variety of universities,
2:19:12
University of Washington, OSU, trying to complete Climate Change Vulnerability
2:19:18
Assessments to help inform future plan revisions, and also project level
2:19:22
work so that we know where our key vulnerabilities are and can try to
2:19:26
plan adaptation actions as we implement projects and also forest planning.
2:19:32
So that's what I've been focusing on as we're kind of making our
2:19:34
way around the region and doing two or three forests together.
2:19:39
We're working on one now in southwest Oregon that's part of
2:19:41
the Northwest Forest Plan area.
2:19:43
It's the Roseburg BLM and the Medford BLM; they're partnering with us.
2:19:48
And we've got the Rogue River-Siskiyou and the Umpqua [National Forests] . So,
2:19:53
we're looking at trying to assess from the vegetation standpoint,
2:19:59
looking at any rangelands we might have, but looking at wildlife,
2:20:02
ecosystem services, and aquatics,
2:20:06
a huge area we're focusing on, looking at stream temperatures and how that might
2:20:10
affect fish habitat, you know, stream type Chinook, bull trout, etc. Then
2:20:15
looking at the effects on wildlife species from potential changes in vegetation,
2:20:20
vegetation shifts, summarizing that in a workshop, and again, another GTR report.
2:20:26
Then we work with managers to try to implement that and pull it into
2:20:31
forest plans when they get to forest planning, like on the Blue Mountains.
2:20:35
We have worked with them.
2:20:36
And then when we get any future forest plans in the Northwest Forest Plan area,
2:20:38
we're hoping that this will feed into the assessment phase of forest planning,
2:20:43
after they do a bioregional assessment.
2:20:45
So, we're teeing up a lot of regional climate change data-sets, you know, and
2:20:48
stream temperature, working with the NorWest stream temperature information
2:20:51
from Dan Isaacs in the Rocky Mountain Research Station, mapping that with
2:20:55
fish distribution information, looking at stream reaches where we might
2:20:59
not have the best habitat into the future because of stream temperatures.
2:21:02
We look at potential shifts in vegetation and how that might affect wildlife and
2:21:06
how that might affect our adaptation actions on the forest when we plant
2:21:11
different seed mixes, that kind of thing.
2:21:14
And we're looking at potential impacts to some of the key ecosystem
2:21:17
services, things people care about, the forest products, tribes’ caring
2:21:20
for First Foods, that kind of thing.
2:21:22
We're trying to do the best job we can, synthesizing and conducting a
2:21:25
mini-synthesis of the vulnerabilities.
2:21:28
In our workshop, working with managers and partners, we identify adaptation
2:21:33
actions and strategies that can be employed to address those vulnerabilities.
2:21:36
We publish that and deliver it to managers, and that will fold into
2:21:41
forest planning and NEPA projects.
2:21:48
The Northwest Forest Plan Science Synthesis is now looking at
2:21:51
climate change in a way that will inform future forest plans.
2:21:55
In the Northwest Forest Plan area for the Forest Service, we added a whole
2:21:58
section on climate change, because that was not in the original FEMAT product.
2:22:03
It wasn't even mentioned.
2:22:04
It's not even mentioned.
2:22:05
It's not really mentioned directly, I don't think.
2:22:07
I don't think, so no.
2:22:08
I'm sure the word climate's in there somewhere talking about weather.
2:22:09
Well, climate.
2:22:10
But not climate change.
2:22:11
But not climate change.
2:22:12
We didn't have a way to model that.
2:22:13
We're using different models and tools, and so, what they've done
2:22:16
is added a whole chapter on that.
2:22:17
[It includes] talking about how that relates back to historic range of
2:22:21
variation, and future range of variation, and then, some of the limitations, what
2:22:26
we're seeing and what we're observing.
2:22:28
It includes published science across the whole Northwest Forest Plan area
2:22:31
and trying to tee up the role of climate change, how that is producing
2:22:35
other stressors, and how that is affecting some land use allocations
2:22:40
and how we manage the forests.
2:22:41
That's another whole chapter in that synthesis because it's a key factor now.
2:22:49
We didn't have the capability to model or do anything with that back in '94.
2:22:54
What are the most telling indicators of climate change affecting things,
2:22:59
whether it be, like for instance, stream temperature and fish count, the
2:23:07
health of the forest, etc. Anything in particular that stands out?
2:23:14
We just completed a climate change vulnerability assessment on the Blue
2:23:16
Mountains over in eastern Oregon.
2:23:18
We could see [when downscaled from] local climate models, we're
2:23:24
predicting some losses of sub-alpine, and encroachment of the rangelands.
2:23:29
So, we're seeing some of those shifts and trying to figure out what that
2:23:32
means to how we manage the forests.
2:23:34
But the biggest thing is looking at stream temperature and the potential
2:23:38
for higher stream temperature and how that might affect fish habitat.
2:23:42
That's the biggest thing we're seeing.
2:23:44
And then, also looking at some analysis we're doing in these
2:23:47
vulnerability assessments, is we're not just looking at maps.
2:23:51
We have peak flow and low flow information that our scientists
2:23:54
have predicted into the future, based on global climate models.
2:23:58
So, we're identifying areas on the landscape where
2:24:02
infrastructure might be at risk.
2:24:03
We basically buffer roads and look at which roads are [vulnerable to]
2:24:10
peak flow increases, which areas are at risk due to high peak flows.
2:24:12
We
2:24:15
identify those so managers can think about those and about how they're going to
2:24:18
manage them in the future, how they manage the culverts on those systems, how do they
2:24:23
look at road closures and decommissioning roads, and considering risks.
2:24:26
Do they need to relocate some recreation sites and campgrounds, that kind of thing
2:24:31
that might be at risk from peak flows?
2:24:33
And they look at how climate change might impact water rights and the availability
2:24:39
of water in some of our forests.
2:24:41
So, those are some of the things.
2:24:43
We’re able to do more
2:24:46
on the aquatics and the riparian.
2:24:48
Well, and it's easier to measure the temperature change.
2:24:52
Right.
2:24:52
And you can immediately identify that, the incremental change;
2:24:56
the processes of succession and vegetation movement is slower.
2:25:00
Right, right, right, slower.
2:25:00
Although fires would be the one.
2:25:02
Right, right.
2:25:03
Insects and disease.
2:25:04
I mean, the disturbance events in fires would be an obvious sign.
2:25:11
Right.
2:25:12
Are there any other memorable experiences or stories about any of your
2:25:16
involvement with the forest plan that you haven't mentioned yet, an anecdote,
2:25:21
something interesting, something funny, something particularly memorable?
2:25:25
Whether it has to do with FEMAT or Gang of Four, or anything to
2:25:29
do with the monitoring things?
2:25:31
Oh, boy.
2:25:34
Nothing.
2:25:34
That might be interesting for the record?
2:25:36
Nothing is really coming to mind except just a lot of people working closely
2:25:40
together, like doing the spatial analysis, and Bob Varner sleeping
2:25:45
under his desk two or three times.
2:25:48
This is the FEMAT, right?
2:25:49
This is FEMAT.
2:25:51
Just things like that.
2:25:55
Interagency coordination and collaboration at its best.
2:25:57
After hours, camaraderie and collaboration that's been built over time, I think,
2:26:03
just because of the experience you have with other people working on
2:26:08
highly influential projects that are done under a tight time line.
2:26:13
You
2:26:15
build bonds with people, you get to understand their
2:26:19
work and what they're doing.
2:26:22
You learn how to work together to make things and deliver products.
2:26:26
So, I can't really think of any funny anecdote.
2:26:28
I can tell you all the stories about what different things
2:26:31
happened in Walla Walla, you know, toilet-papering the office and things
2:26:35
like that, that guys did after-hours.
2:26:36
Because we worked, you know, sometimes 20-hour days over there.
2:26:39
People do just kind of crazy stuff when they're tired.
2:26:41
And you revert to your frat and sorority sister type behavior?
2:26:47
Sometimes after hours they do that, but yeah.
2:26:49
Yeah, so.
2:26:50
But mostly, the biggest thing I see, and the key message is that Northwest Forest
2:26:55
Plan really inspired a whole new way to collaborate and communicate, and to
2:27:01
basically have agencies work together.
2:27:05
That really stuck together.
2:27:06
We have the Regional Interagency Executive Committee still functioning.
2:27:10
There's all different members.
2:27:11
None of them are the same ones that were there when this was signed.
2:27:16
So, I've seen them change over time.
2:27:17
I mean, we've had so many different changes since 1994.
2:27:22
But they still are communicating and coordinating, and they meet
2:27:25
twice a year and they still have relationships, and they're still working
2:27:28
together with overarching principles.
2:27:31
They do believe in overarching principles of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:27:34
And we've been able to capture that in that Northwest Forest Plan framework
2:27:37
document to show the public, no matter what happens with planning in the
2:27:42
future, we're still all committed to these principles and they'll
2:27:44
be part of whatever plan we have.
2:27:46
We may implement the plans differently in order to get to these
2:27:49
objectives, but they're still the same principles and objectives.
2:27:53
Now, a lot of the participants I've interviewed have said that depending on
2:27:59
what time, it didn't even necessarily depend on what time of their career or
2:28:02
part of their career it was, that being involved in this forest plan, especially
2:28:06
the big events in the '90s, was like the highlight of their career, or one
2:28:12
of the highlights of their careers.
2:28:14
Would you characterize it in that way?
2:28:17
Yeah, I think it was pivotal for a lot of our scientists.
2:28:19
It kind of launched a lot of these scientists.
2:28:22
Gordie Reeves, it launched his career.
2:28:24
And other scientists, like Marty Raphael was already doing things.
2:28:28
Now they're all our “super-scientists,” what we call super-scientists
2:28:30
in the Forest Service.
2:28:31
They're the highest-ranking GS scientists we have.
2:28:36
Tom Spies, Gordie Reeves, Marty Raphael.
2:28:38
I mean, they're the big names and big scientists.
2:28:41
So, what we're hoping now is we're going to have a new
2:28:43
breed of folks that come along.
2:28:45
We're trying to bring some of these younger people along with the science
2:28:47
synthesis we're doing now, so that we have a whole new set of scientists
2:28:51
that carry on into the future and become those long-term people.
2:28:53
And for me, personally, I think I would have ended up in a
2:28:56
completely different career had I not done the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:29:01
I think I would have probably maybe gone back to rangeland management or
2:29:05
done something completely different, instead of these large planning projects.
2:29:08
I've basically been working in planning my whole life, and I think I'll finish it out
2:29:12
with this climate change and the planning there, and coordinating on what happens
2:29:17
with Region 5 and 6 plan revisions.
2:29:19
've got three parts to this one question.
2:29:21
This will be finishing questions.
2:29:23
Okay, sure.
2:29:24
Now, in your view, what is the most important reason for having created and
2:29:27
implemented the Northwest Forest Plan?
2:29:35
To basically lift the injunction and to get timber harvest happening again for
2:29:40
the communities in the Pacific Northwest.
2:29:43
I think that was the biggest thing.
2:29:44
And also, to try to put something in place, a plan that everybody can look
2:29:49
to, to have more of a balanced approach for how to manage the land, and get
2:29:55
forest products out and other products that are of interest to communities
2:29:58
and people and the tribes, but to also protect the environment and the
2:30:04
species that use that environment.
2:30:07
Probably one of the most important things is it was a plan to try
2:30:09
to find some kind of balance.
2:30:13
What have we learned from the Northwest Forest Plan process regarding
2:30:17
proactive management, but also human limitations on managing nature?
2:30:25
Oh, boy, repeat that one for me again.
2:30:26
Okay.
2:30:27
What have we learned from the Northwest Forest Plan process regarding proactive
2:30:31
management, but also kind of human limitations on managing nature?
2:30:36
In other words, for all good intentions, whether we also learned about what
2:30:41
we can't necessarily do or predict.
2:30:44
I think the Northwest Forest Plan allowed us to put a large fabric
2:30:49
or framework across the landscape.
2:30:51
Like this reserve system allowed us to put a strategy in place on the land that was
2:30:59
a connected framework, patchwork quilt, whatever you want to call it, that's
2:31:04
basically a way to manage the forests that still protected late-successional
2:31:08
species, but did allow timber harvest.
2:31:11
So, I see that that set a strategy where we could try to be proactive, we could
2:31:14
try to get more timber out, but we could also be proactive in trying to stop the
2:31:18
decline of the owls and the murrelets, and other late-successional species.
2:31:21
So, I think the strategies served us well and maybe we can tweak a few
2:31:26
things as we move into the future.
2:31:27
We don't need to throw the whole thing out, let's just fix the
2:31:30
little pieces that are broken.
2:31:31
And I think that's the goal of Region 5 and Region 6.
2:31:34
And then the human limitations, I think climate change is one big thing.
2:31:37
We can't predict what's going to happen.
2:31:40
There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and we don't know what
2:31:43
climate change is going to do.
2:31:44
And we don't know what kind of impact invasive species like the
2:31:48
barred owl are going to have.
2:31:49
We can't manage those.
2:31:50
But we can manage the habitat that's on Forest Service lands
2:31:53
and BLM lands, but we can't manage the critters and how they respond.
2:31:57
We can't manage everything in nature.
2:32:00
So, we just really try to manage the habitat and the part we can contribute to.
2:32:07
I think one of the biggest lessons, and Gordie Reeves will tell you this, is that
2:32:11
an all-lands approach is the only way to manage the Pacific Northwest forests.
2:32:14
You can't just look at the Forest Service lands, or the BLM lands, separately.
2:32:18
We have to look at them in conjunction with the private lands.
2:32:20
Because what happens on private lands really has a big impact on species.
2:32:24
We can't do too much about that.
2:32:26
But it's a whole connected network.
2:32:29
Well, I think that's a marvelous final answer for our interview.
2:32:32
Okay.
2:32:32
Thank you, Becky.
2:32:33
Thank you.
2:32:34
Wonderful.
2:32:34
Okay.
