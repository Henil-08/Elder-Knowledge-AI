00:01
This is Friday, November 21st.
00:03
I'm Tasha Galardi and I'm meeting with Gwil Evans in Strand Hall
00:07
to do an oral history interview.
00:08
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Mr. Evans, I'm looking forward
00:11
to learning more about your life.
00:13
It's my pleasure.
00:14
So, I know that some of the questions that I'm going to ask are repetitive of
00:18
the information that you sent me, but I kind of wanted to record them on tape.
00:21
Sure.
00:21
So, I already know the answers in advance to a few things, but...
00:24
So, where and when were you born?
00:27
I was born in Portland at the Emanuel Hospital, February 25, 1939.
00:34
So, I'm very interested in your name.
00:35
It's a little unusual.
00:36
Is there some family history behind that?
00:39
It's a Welsh name, and Grandfather was Gwilym, G-W-I-L-Y-M, Gwilym
00:49
Owen Evans, and he was a streetcar conductor on the Council Crest streetcar
00:55
line, and for many years, and the people who rode on the streetcar
01:00
shortened his name for him to Gwil.
01:03
So, when I came along, my parents wanted me to name - wanted me to be named after
01:08
him, but they chose to leave the Y-M off, for which I have long been grateful
01:13
[Tasha laughs] because of the - it's tough enough to get people to spell my name
01:17
correctly with just four letters [laughs]
01:19
. Right.
01:19
And what was your experience growing up, having an unusual name like that?
01:23
I learned to answer to almost anything, and I somewhere have a collection of
01:31
things that have arrived in the mail addressed to me under various names
01:35
that were not the correct names but were very creative variations on it.
01:40
I can imagine.
01:41
I noticed here, in the 1960 yearbook photo, that it's spelled with two Ls,
01:46
and at first, I thought it was a typo, but I found it in a few different places.
01:50
That's one - that's probably the most common misspelling, is two Ls, and
01:56
any more.
01:57
In fact, when I sign up for something or ask people to make an appointment
02:03
for me, I say "it's Gwil Evans with - and it's G-W-I-L, with one L" [laughs]
02:08
. So now, it says here that your column was Gwil's Quill, but here
02:11
it's got two Ls, but in fact, in The Barometer, it was with one L.
02:16
That's right.
02:16
And this is from - what we're looking at is from the Beaver
02:19
yearbook in 1960 I believe, and-
02:22
Yeah.
02:22
...and this is a great example of the kinds of things I've gone through in
02:28
life with misspellings of my name and sort of getting accustomed to if it's
02:33
close then that's - at least I know who they're talking about [both laugh]
02:37
. Right, and every reference I found to you in this edition of the
02:40
yearbook, it was spelled this way.
02:41
[Laughs]
02:41
So, that was a poor editing job on somebody's part, apparently.
02:45
Right.
02:45
Do you have brothers and sisters?
02:47
No, I'm an only child.
02:49
You're an only child.
02:50
What was that experience like for you, growing up?
02:52
Well, of course, I didn't know what it would be like growing up with brothers
02:57
and sisters, not having had any, but now my partner, Bill Cook, had three
03:06
siblings, and through him and his family I've come to appreciate what it means to
03:12
have siblings, and respect that a lot.
03:17
I expect that there were things that I missed, but truly I was,
03:22
um, I had a good childhood and no - would have - there's nothing
03:28
really that I would change about it.
03:31
I suppose that one, there's the risk of being a spoiled only child because
03:37
you presume that you should be the one that gets all the attention, and I
03:41
don't know, maybe I was, but I had good parents and a fun childhood, really.
03:48
I grew up to the sixth grade in Portland and then moved in 1950, in the sixth
03:56
grade, over to what is now Lincoln City, in the Nelscott district of Lincoln City.
04:03
How old were your parents when you were born?
04:06
Hmm.
04:08
Were they older parents, or-
04:09
I think - no, I think they were... no, they weren't older parents.
04:12
I think they were probably in their early twenties.
04:17
So, was it a choice on their part to only have one child?
04:23
I never really got clear about that, although I think my mom had a miscarriage
04:27
at... and I'm going to say maybe after I was born, and that was always - I
04:35
grew up in a family, as I think a lot of people in my era did, where it was...
04:43
kind of the norm was don't say, and it was - became-it was clear that was a
04:48
sensitive subject, and so they always avoided it, and I always did too.
04:54
That was probably easier for both of you.
04:56
Uh-huh.
04:56
What did your parents do for employment?
05:01
My dad, when we were in Portland, worked for a bakery which is still in
05:09
existence, Franz Bakery, and he was first - well actually, even before that,
05:15
when he was a very young man, I'm going to say like in high school and soon
05:21
there, soon after high school, he worked at a tailor shop in Portland where his
05:27
mom also worked, called Joy the Tailor.
05:30
And he was a floor man at Joy the Tailor, which in those - this was a place that
05:36
did custom clothing, and so he worked in sales and fitting people and so forth.
05:44
And then his mom had a supervisory job there.
05:48
And then after that, he went to work for Franz Bakery.
05:52
He was a route salesman.
05:54
Then he became a sales supervisor, which meant that he supervised
06:00
a number of people who drove bread trucks and made deliveries.
06:04
And he was doing that when he and - I think he, probably more
06:09
than my mom, followed his dream, his romantic dream, and bought a motel
06:15
at the Oregon coast in... into which we moved in 19-December of 1950.
06:22
And it was right on, right on the beachfront at [stumbles] , at what
06:28
was then a community, separate community, by the name of Nelscott,
06:34
and is - and has then, has since, been subsumed into Lincoln City.
06:40
And once we moved there, my mom ran the motel and my dad
06:46
entered into a partnership in a Chevrolet Oldsmobile dealership.
06:49
And so, he sold cars for years over there and got into local politics
06:57
and was - I think his first election was to the school board and then to
07:04
the water board, and he was the water commissioner for a while, and then he
07:11
and a few other community leaders looked at the situation where there were all
07:17
these small communities adjacent to one another in that immediate vicinity, and
07:22
there were multiple fire departments and multiple water departments and
07:26
multiple police departments, and they said this doesn't make sense,
07:29
why don't we have one community?
07:30
So, they led a consolidation effort, which succeeded, and he was elected the
07:37
first mayor of Lincoln City and - which is a non-paid, volunteer role - and he
07:46
continued in that for I believe six years.
07:49
For six years at Lincoln City, all the while still engaged
07:54
in the automobile business.
07:56
And did your parents have that motel for the rest of their lives?
08:00
Yes, my mom died first, and then my dad ran it - actually, he sort of migrated it
08:06
- more into longer-term rentals, but yes, I - that's where he was living when he died.
08:13
Hmm, so you grew up for most of your life in a motel.
08:17
That must have been an interesting experience.
08:19
Well, it - yeah, it didn't - and it didn't really feel it.
08:21
I'd say it felt more like an apartment house or something,
08:24
but we lived on the second floor of this two-story structure, and
08:32
it was, as I say, right on the oceanfront, and it was a scary place to live.
08:37
I mean, I've... [laughs]
08:41
people wonder why I don't have a lot of enthusiasm about going to the
08:44
beach, and I think it's for having grown up immediately adjacent to the
08:49
ocean and gotten through a lot of scary storms and that kind of thing.
08:54
Is it still there?
08:55
Yes, it's a - it has since been turned into condominiums.
09:00
Aha, that's really interesting.
09:02
So, you said before that you had a nice childhood and, but was there
09:06
anything that you haven't mentioned so far that was particularly
09:09
memorable about your childhood?
09:11
Well,
09:15
I think I did a lot of interesting things as a child, and growing up in
09:18
a small rural - then-rural - community that was mostly tourism, fishing,
09:24
and forestry, were the income sources at that time on the Oregon coast.
09:29
And one of the things that I did in the early summers was I - this would have been
09:35
in probably the seventh and eighth grades - I bought a commercial popcorn machine
09:42
like those used in movie theatres, and
09:49
adjacent to the motel, opened a little stand for selling sundries to tourists.
10:00
So, it was amazing how you could pop fresh popcorn and the aroma of that
10:06
would waft down the street and people would make their way to come buy popcorn.
10:11
And I had things like sunglasses and suntan lotion and those sorts of things
10:17
that tourists to the beach might want.
10:19
And I did that for a couple of summers.
10:22
And then - and I don't really remember what year it was, but I was always
10:28
into photography, and I mean from as far back as I can remember, always
10:34
photography, always part of my life, and you know, I, in high school, took
10:39
pictures for the yearbook and so forth.
10:41
But early in high school I was so into photography that my mom sort of evicted
10:47
me and my darkroom from my bedroom, and so I rented a building about two or
10:54
three blocks away and opened a camera store, photofinishing lab, and portrait
11:00
studio, and ran that for several years.
11:04
And in the course of that, I, of course, needed supplies and I needed to be able
11:10
to get supplies wholesale so I could sale them retail, and in - and that
11:17
led me to become at, at the time, the nation's youngest Eastman Kodak dealer.
11:23
And it was great because in the wintertime when I was going to school the business
11:30
slowed down, but I could run it on a part-time basis; in the summer when it was
11:35
really - there were a lot of people, and taking pictures, it was a fulltime job and
11:40
I earned quite a bit of money from that.
11:42
Do you remember your first camera?
11:45
Well, the very first camera I earned selling seeds in the neighborhood in
11:50
Portland, and you know, I'm sure all my parents' friends bought seeds that
11:54
they didn't need, and I sold enough seed packets to earn credits to buy
12:01
a - some premium of my choice, which was this cam-roll film camera, took one-
12:05
What do you mean credits?
12:08
This was - I'm sure it was - I don't know what seed company it was, but the
12:13
seed company had this notion that if you could get kids to go out and sell your
12:17
seeds, you ought to have incentives.
12:20
And so, you know, if you sold 100 seed packets, you might earn 100 credits
12:25
toward your choice of any of these various premiums, one of which was a camera.
12:31
Uh-huh.
12:32
And in point of fact, a very cheap plastic camera with a plastic lens and so forth.
12:37
But that's where it began.
12:39
And then I just migrated through a lot of different cameras, but ultimately
12:45
when I was running the camera store, I was working with Speed Graph-four
12:49
by five Speed Graphics, a five by seven-inch Graflex, and some view
12:55
cameras, mostly sheet film view cameras.
12:59
In fact, I just ran across the other day a number of negatives, four by 5-inch
13:03
negatives, from those days in Lincoln - in what's now Lincoln City - images of
13:11
the place, of the town, and friends and-
13:14
That you had taken?
13:15
That I'd taken, and Nelscott Friendship Club.
13:17
The local ladies who would meet once a month would always have
13:21
me come photograph them at their meeting, and that kind of thing.
13:25
Oh, well you should consider at some point donating those to the university
13:28
because I think that would be a nice addition to your file that...
13:30
Uh-huh.
13:31
I expect that's where they will go.
13:33
...Larry's creating for you over there.
13:34
Mm-hmm.
13:35
You seem to have always had quite an entrepreneurial spirit.
13:41
Well, I suppose.
13:43
I don't know that I ever thought of it as entrepreneurial as much as pursuing
13:46
my passion, and I've always - and again, that's a - that's probably a term that
13:53
I picked up more in adulthood, but I, in reflecting on it, I think I had the
14:00
good fortune to be able to pursue my passion, whatever that was, and in a small
14:04
community it was easier to pur-I mean you know, if we had stayed in Portland,
14:10
what are the chances that I would have opened a camera store and photofinishing
14:13
lab and portrait studio and all that?
14:17
And so, circumstances were such that I could pursue my passion.
14:21
And I also, during that time when I was running the camera store, I was also a
14:27
stringer for The Oregonian, and I would write stories, news stories, about things.
14:33
Usually, it was kind of ambulance chasing.
14:35
It was, you know, the accident that would kill three people, and I'd be
14:40
on scene with my camera and I'd take the picture, process it, write the
14:44
story, put it on that afternoon's bus to Portland, The Oregonian would send
14:49
someone to the bus station, pick that up, carry it over to the newspaper, and
14:54
it would be in the next day's Oregonian.
14:57
And that's, you know, those were the kinds of things that got my interest
15:03
in journalism going, I think, was just I'd been working on the ca-the high
15:11
school yearbook and the high school newspaper and taking pictures, and
15:15
it all just kind of fit together.
15:17
What's a stringer?
15:18
A stringer is a person who - I don't... I suppose there are stringers still today
15:25
- a stringer meant that The Oregonian couldn't afford to have - or any newspaper
15:31
- couldn't afford to have a salaried person in a particular location, so they would
15:37
identify somebody who could meet their standards journalistically and... and
15:43
they would either, they'd establish a phone connection with you - that is,
15:49
they'd know your phone number, and with my case, I would know their phone number
15:54
- so, I was being alert to what is news, and if I saw something that was news,
16:00
I would call them and say "thus and so has happened, would you be interested?"
16:04
And they'd give me a yes or no.
16:06
Or if they became aware of something, like they know something's coming up
16:09
tomorrow and they'd like coverage of it; the Salmon Derby at Siletz Bay, and
16:15
they'd say "we'd like coverage of that."
16:18
So, a stringer then goes to the location of the news and reports it.
16:24
In my case, I was able to do it both photographically and in writing.
16:30
And so, then you send it and it gets pub-and based on what gets published,
16:35
not based on what you send them - based on what gets published, they
16:40
actually measure the column inches.
16:43
Didn't matter whether it was photograph or story; they'd measure
16:47
the column inches and pay you per column inches for what you've done.
16:51
And how much did they pay you?
16:53
Well, I was just sitting here - I haven't thought about this in years, but...
16:59
it was certainly less than a dollar a column inch.
17:02
Now, you know, a dollar went further then, but...
17:07
that's why you always, if you were sending photos, you always hoped they
17:10
played them big so that, you know, if [laughs] , if it's twice as big as
17:16
the last one, you'd get twice as much money as you did for the last one.
17:19
So, there were incentives like that.
17:22
You couldn't get away with writing long, however, because The Oregonian had good
17:27
editors and they would pretty much, you know, edit back down to what they wanted.
17:33
So, it sounds that that wasn't a financial motivation for you to continue to do that;
17:37
you just enjoyed doing the journalism and-
17:39
Yeah, well it's all-I mean, it was always fun at the end of the month
17:42
to get a check from The Oregonian.
17:44
I think maybe it was more fun to see the news-the photo in the newspaper the
17:49
next morning, in a statewide newspaper, that says "photo by Gwil Evans." And
17:54
occasionally I'd get a byline in it.
17:56
And I think I was one of the youngest stringers that they had at the time.
18:00
Most people were adults.
18:03
And what was your goal in earning money?
18:05
Did-is there something specific?
18:06
A nicer camera, a car?
18:08
Were there things that you really wanted?
18:10
Well, we didn't have much money, and
18:15
by and large, if I wanted something, I needed to earn the money, and so...
18:22
that was, that was probably the incentive.
18:25
Yeah, I mean it wasn't driven by money, but I was aware that if there were
18:30
things out - and in photography, then as now - if you, um, I mean there's always
18:36
something to spend money on [laughs]
18:38
. Right, some new supplies.
18:39
Yeah, or a new lens, you know, or the latest model of the
18:43
camera, or that sort of thing.
18:44
And I've been a techie all my life and I - there's always something
18:50
technical out there that I would - I mean I, right now I'm shooting HD
18:55
video with Sony's top-of-the-line professional HD camera, and I know
19:01
what the next piece of equipment is that I want to buy to enhance that.
19:05
[Laughs] so there were never any shortage of things that you wanted to...
19:09
That's right [laughs] , that's right.
19:09
So, we talked a little bit, it sounds like you kind of considered Lincoln
19:12
City more your hometown than Portland?
19:16
Well, it was [stumbles] , you know, it was through the sixth grade, and
19:20
then sixth through the 12th grade, so it was almost half and half.
19:28
More... I don't know, that's an interesting question.
19:31
They each influenced me.
19:35
I suppose that Lincoln City may have been the greater of the influences,
19:39
and yet, by the same token,
19:45
I kind of grew up with this love/hate relationship with the ocean that
19:50
I don't know whether I've... whether I ever really registered
19:55
in my head as having a hometown.
19:58
I can - you know, like as we're doing here, I can say "well,
20:01
this is where I grew up."
20:03
When you went to college though and people would say "where are you from"...?
20:05
Yeah, I'd probably say the most recent place, you know, from Lincoln.
20:08
Right.
20:08
Well, in Nelscott at that time, because it wasn't yet Lincoln City.
20:12
And it was called Nelscott your entire time living there?
20:16
When I was there, yeah, and then after I left was when the consolidation occurred.
20:22
What do you remember most clearly about living in Portland as a child?
20:26
Well, I - we lived in the Alameda district of Portland, so it would be northeast.
20:34
Literally where we lived was
20:38
3124 NE 25th, which was between cross streets of Klickitat and Siskiyou, and
20:46
it was in the Alameda school district, or - or and - the Grant High School district.
20:53
And it was - there were a lot of post-World War II families living there,
20:58
so there were a number of kids my age.
21:01
And among the things that I remember there were...
21:09
I had a lot of classmates who were Jewish, and our family
21:14
didn't - hadn't prior to that, hadn't
21:18
any, what do I want to say, close family relationships with Jewish families, but
21:24
because of my classmate relationships and going to their houses to play and
21:28
meeting their moms and so on, there were just wonderful things that kind
21:32
of opened my eyes to things that were different; that not every family was
21:37
like my family, and that was always good.
21:39
That was fun.
21:43
And most of them were far wealthier than our family.
21:46
They lived in - they lived up on the Alameda Heights, so you had
21:49
to go up the hill to these big houses where my classmates lived.
21:53
And so, that was a good experience.
21:56
And then another, the other one that I would think of in terms of that experience
22:00
was about two houses down from us was a family whose name was Miles, and
22:10
Gordon Miles was a photographer - I mean he, he was actually a mover, but
22:15
his hobby was photography - and Gordon had, at that time, a daughter who had no
22:23
interest in photography whatever, but I was the neighbor kid from down the street
22:28
and was really interested in photography, and he had a wonderful darkroom.
22:32
And so, from Gordon, I learned a whole lot about cameras and
22:36
photography and how to make wonderful prints and that sort of thing.
22:40
And my mom and I were the babysitters for Gordon's wife, for their
22:49
daughter, Sheila when Gordon's wife had their son, Dennis, Denny.
22:56
And so, our families maintained contact even after we moved to the coast.
23:01
We were good friends.
23:02
My - the point of this story is that Denny Miles then, whom I have now known
23:08
since his day of his birth, then grew up and was an Oregon State alumnus, and
23:16
then went on to be the press secretary for Governor Vic Atiyeh, and Denny
23:22
continues today - to this day - as a political consultant, lives in Salem.
23:25
And so, those are the kind - those are the sorts of things that I reflect on,
23:30
coming out of the Portland experience.
23:32
Was your family religious?
23:34
No-well, my grandmother was Christian Scientist and my parents never really
23:41
went to church, although they seemed for a while to see fit that it was
23:47
important for me to go to Sunday school.
23:49
And I want to, occasionally in Portland, to a Christian Science Sunday school,
23:55
and then when we moved to the coast there was a Christian Science Sunday
23:59
school not far away, to which I went.
24:02
And I have to admit that I never really understood anything about that
24:07
religion, and then throughout the rest of my life, I've never been religious.
24:13
And in fact, I'd say at this point
24:17
it - there's been a lot of things about churches and gay people
24:20
that, if anything, would be pushing me away from organized religion.
24:25
I mean, I think there's a lot of merit and there's a spiritual dimension to life,
24:30
but I don't think you need someone to be the intermediary between you and God.
24:36
Mm-hmm.
24:37
So, so that - those were some great stories about Portland, and it
24:41
sounds like you really value that connection, that long-term connection.
24:44
Mm-hmm.
24:45
So, what about in Nelscott?
24:47
Was there some something besides your fear of the ocean and that experience
24:51
[Gwil laughs] , but you know, what do you remember most clearly about
24:54
that town when you were growing up.
24:57
I think the experience of a small rural community.
25:00
And I don't think I would have used the word rural community at the time,
25:06
but on reflection, that's what it was.
25:09
It was a... if you set aside the tourism, which probably made the population grow
25:16
by ten, tenfold in the summertime, if you set aside that, it was basically a
25:23
community that had retirees, people who made their living in the forest, and
25:28
people who made their living from the sea.
25:31
And so, they were really - we were surrounded by salt of the earth
25:37
kinds of people, and the things that we took for granted are
25:43
really quite amazing in retrospect.
25:44
I mean, I remember being in grade school at Taft, at Taft Grade School, and it was
25:51
immediately adjacent to the Siletz River.
25:54
So, there's the grade school, the road from upriver, and then there's the river.
26:01
And so, we could look out the window of the classroom, and would be prompted to
26:06
do so rather frequently as the log trucks would pass by, and the customary load on
26:13
these log trucks was one log, and the log would be eight to 10 feet in diameter.
26:20
Oh my goodness.
26:22
And so, we took that as just sort of oh, well that's what it means to be logging.
26:28
Well, today you simply would not be seeing anything like that.
26:32
And so, you know, I remember that kind of thing.
26:35
I also remember that we would walk down from school at lunch hour to Siletz Bay,
26:43
which was three or four blocks away,
26:49
especially in the fall, and either get a sandwich or take the sandwich
26:54
that we brought from home or whatever and just walk down there and watch
26:58
the people who would be there for the annual Siletz Salmon Derby.
27:02
And as you'd look across the bay, you could darn near walk across
27:07
it on the backs of the fish, they were so, so present there.
27:12
and Bernie's tackle shop would have all the color pictures of the
27:19
people who had, in the previous day or two, caught big salmon there.
27:24
And it was not unusual for the salmon to be so long that the person who
27:31
caught them wasn't tall enough to hold the salmon's tail up off the pavement.
27:37
These were adults?
27:38
These were adult people, yeah.
27:41
And again, everybody just took it for granted, like oh, well of course these
27:46
salmon are going to be here forever and we're always going to be able to come
27:49
fish this way, and aren't these beaut-and they were, you know, beautiful fish.
27:53
And I remember things like that from living there.
27:57
That must really have an impact on what you do now as part of the university
28:01
and this, you know, Sea Grant.
28:03
I saw the work that you've done with that.
28:04
You know, you have a real in-depth experience of living on the ocean,
28:09
and what used to be and what no longer is exactly the same.
28:12
Mm-hmm.
28:13
It drives home the kinds of things that we collectively, as a society, the
28:18
responsibilities that we have to preserve, you know, the, at least the vestiges of
28:25
those, salmon being a good case in point.
28:29
So, what were the rural expectations for young men when you were a teenager and a
28:33
young man, just in our culture in general?
28:39
Hmm.
28:41
Well, I suppose the societal expectations were you - and if you'd look at
28:50
maybe the expectations in the rural communities of the Oregon coast - I
28:56
suppose it was you graduated from high school, got married, and got a job,
29:02
and not necessarily in that order.
29:04
I'm not sure what the order expectation would be, but graduate from high
29:07
school, family, job, and so many of my classmates did exactly that and
29:13
went back into, you know, working in the woods or catching fish.
29:22
Very few from my high school went to college, and most of us
29:29
who did then escaped from there.
29:33
But I think in the greater society that the model was roughly the same;
29:36
was, you know, that you finished your education and then got a job and got
29:42
married and had a family and so forth.
29:47
Did you feel pressure from your parents to fulfill that expectation
29:51
and to stay in your hometown?
29:53
No expectation to stay in hometown.
29:55
In fact, they were very strong supporters of college education, and I don't think
30:02
that I ever heard them say anything about "you ought to do what we do"
30:07
or - and my mom, you asked about what she did, and she was, she ran the motel.
30:13
She did have some occasional part-time jobs, but she ran the motel
30:20
and she didn't - she really never did really like the Oregon coast.
30:26
And her sort of dislike for it grew as she grew older.
30:31
But I think her -- she -s a strong advocate for don't let
30:36
yourself get caught in this.
30:39
Hmm.
30:39
And to, and to - and they both really - I think they both worked
30:43
really hard to help me through college, although I always had jobs in college.
30:51
But there were times when they would assist in one way or another.
30:57
One of the ways that they assisted was my dad, being in the automobile
31:00
business, would often have a car that I would get to use, and so that was nice.
31:08
That must have been really nice [laughs]
31:09
. Yeah.
31:09
Sometimes they were real spiffy cars [both laugh]
31:12
. You would have - must have been the envy of a few of your friends.
31:15
Yeah.
31:15
So, how were the gender roles distributed within your family?
31:18
Like what did you feel like men and women were kind of expected to do
31:22
inside the home and outside the home, based on what your parents modeled?
31:26
I think we had a, maybe more of a shared, set of shared responsibilities than might
31:35
have been common in some families because
31:41
to keep the motel running, which was... in my estimation,
31:45
it was never economically...
31:50
an economically sound model.
31:52
It was always something that if you factored in the family's labor for
31:59
it, then [laughs] I can't imagine that it ever turned a profit.
32:07
You know,
32:11
that... presumably, your labor is worth something, and so if you were to add that
32:14
into just the cost of operating this and what its income was, I doubt it ever paid
32:19
for itself, let alone paid my parents what they invested of their own time.
32:26
But what that meant was, in the higher seasons, every Sunday all
32:30
three of us did all the stuff.
32:31
So, I've cleaned toilets and mopped floors and done laundry and folded
32:37
laundry and run the mangle and washed the windows, and my dad did that and my
32:42
mom did that, and all three of us cooked.
32:48
You know, whose turn is it today to make the pot roast, and that sort of thing.
32:52
And my dad loved to cook and was a good cook.
32:56
My mom was an excellent cook, and I was pretty good at a few things.
33:02
And I think that probably...
33:08
I think maybe, if nothing else, it taught me maybe humility.
33:11
It was just that, you know, there's work to be done and you're - if
33:15
it's going to get done, everybody kind of needs to pitch in and do
33:21
it.
33:21
I don't think there were - I mean, the role model was sure, my dad
33:27
had more structured employment outside the home, but it was
33:32
clearly a shared responsibility.
33:34
Was he the head of the family, the ultimate decision-maker?
33:40
... In
33:40
your perception as a child?
33:42
No, no.
33:42
I think that it was - I think they had a pretty shared model.
33:46
There might have been certain things where he got to decide and certain
33:50
things where my mom got to decide, but I think they talked about a lot of things.
33:55
And then... hmm.
34:02
I don't... I don't ever really remember the sort of well, I'm
34:10
the man and I - therefore I get to do X. Never anything like that.
34:15
And if anything, I suppose it may have been a little more matriarchal.
34:21
That's interesting.
34:22
Yeah.
34:23
So, you talked about the move you made from Portland to Nelscott; that was
34:26
the only move that you made as a child?
34:29
Those were the only two places that you lived?
34:30
We had moved from one house to another in Portland when I was a youngster, but
34:35
I don't remember much about that one.
34:38
Did your family ever travel?
34:40
Very little.
34:41
I mean, and Bill always kids me about that today, is that neither did we ever
34:46
take any vacations, and pretty much, with few exceptions, we still don't.
34:53
And I mean, I grew up in a family where I think I remember one
34:58
vacation, and we went up to Idaho
35:02
to Lake Pend Oreille, I think, and...
35:07
it was - that was kind of nice, but it was - when you own a
35:10
motel, you don't take vacations.
35:12
Even during the slow season?
35:14
Mm-mm.
35:15
Because a lot of times that was when the cars were to be sold, and school
35:19
was in session, and there wasn't a lot of money anyway, so you know.
35:25
So, you graduated from high school in Nelscott.
35:27
Yeah, Taft High School, mm-hmm.
35:29
And what year was that?
35:32
Fifty-seven.
35:33
Fifty-seven.
35:34
Yeah.
35:34
And then where did you go to college after high school?
35:37
I went to Reed in Portland immediately after that as a chemistry major
35:42
because my high school chemistry teacher had told me that that was
35:47
the career I was suited for [laughs]
35:50
. And how did you pick Reed?
35:53
Well...
35:57
it had a good reputation, academically.
36:02
I was a good student in high school, and it was a college that I was familiar with
36:09
because my aunt and uncle lived near Reed in the Eastmoreland area of Portland.
36:19
So, I was acquainted with it as a place.
36:23
And so, my grades were such that I was eligible to get in.
36:28
My chemistry professor had me convinced that I was to be a chemist, without
36:34
really knowing what that meant, and so one thing or another, there I was at Reed.
36:40
And it was the first time that I had realized that I might not be
36:50
the smartest kid in the class or the person getting the best grades.
36:54
That was the first time I had realized that.
36:56
And I was surrounded by people, most of whom were from California or the east
37:04
coast, maybe half of whom had gone to prep schools and who had grown up in
37:11
homes where the over dinner conversation would be about the merits of the
37:16
current United States monetary policy.
37:19
Oh [laughs]
37:20
. Or foreign policy or politics, and where the kids were expected to debate their
37:30
parents using sound logic and accrued facts [Tasha chuckles] . And that was
37:37
just a very different environment than the one that I had come to Reed from.
37:42
And although I loved it, it was a great place,
37:49
it was - like so many kids here, we know at OSU that, you know, it's something
37:55
like there are 3.4 changes of majors per student on average, or something like
38:02
that - and well, to me this notion of chemistry, and then I'm surrounded by kids
38:09
who have been talking about chemistry and physics with their parents since age five,
38:17
and I'm not really getting it the way that I was accustomed to
38:22
getting school, it was a hard place academically to feel really at home.
38:30
And I think I was just immature for it.
38:36
And then, to top it off, there was a professor who had no patience for me,
38:43
who was always critical of anything that I wrote, and his admonition was I don't
38:52
know what you're going to do in life, but don't ever let it be about writing
38:58
[both laugh] . And I think he was probably well-intended, but I was at,
39:01
you know, whatever age that was, 18, 19, something like that, and I was not
39:06
accustomed to that kind of response to anything I'd done, and so it
39:12
was - it didn't feel like a good fit.
39:16
And plus, it was - I was running through mon-burning through money faster than
39:21
what I was really prepared to do.
39:23
So, it seemed it like Oregon State was a good place to come, and my cousin, who
39:27
was my only other age-related relative, had come to OSU - OSC, then - the prior
39:38
year, because he and I were the same age.
39:41
He had come as a freshman here, and then, without getting too far off
39:49
track, he became ill and died during the freshman year, and so there was kind of
39:57
experience of well, Roy had had a good OSU
40:02
first year, and maybe that meant this was a good place for me to come.
40:06
So, I came to Oregon State and really - I went into General Science
40:12
and just began exploring what
40:17
the possibilities were.
40:19
And I connected back up with a high school who was here at OSU who was active, Ard-by
40:28
the name of Arden Olson, and Arden was actively involved in The Barometer and he
40:33
said, "oh, this is just great, you'll - I know you'll love, you ought to come get
40:36
involved." And that's sort of was where I found my place, things that worked.
40:42
I was taking science courses that I enjoyed and then I was - I had
40:47
wonderful writing teachers who helped me regain confidence that I
40:52
might be able to write something.
40:54
And in particular, a writing - a journalism teacher whose name was
41:01
Adelaide V. Lake, and Adelaide was an outstanding teacher, and she was
41:08
former society editor of The Oregonian and a former publisher of a small
41:13
weekly newspaper that she owned.
41:16
And Adelaide was just this most delightful - I think she's the teacher
41:19
everybody wishes they get, you know?
41:22
And she sort of, she inspired me and kind of gave my life direction.
41:30
Well, that answers my next question, which was how did you decide to come
41:33
to OSU, so you got two in one there.
41:36
So, what was your eventual major?
41:40
Well, it
41:44
was... it was General Science with a strong Chemistry emphasis, and Journalism.
41:50
And there was no real way to, at that time, to major in journalism
41:56
at Oregon State, because University of Oregon had the journalism degree.
42:00
But there were many journalism courses, and outstanding journalism teachers here,
42:05
so I took every journalism course, but I had to have an academic home and so
42:10
that was sort of why the science bent, and I enjoyed the science side of it.
42:15
And that - and actually, as it turned out, with no particular...
42:21
wisdom about what it was doing, was I discovered later that I had emerged
42:27
as something of a science journalist, that I could write about science
42:30
in a way that people who weren't scientists could understand it.
42:35
And the other thing that coupled nicely was that I was here - the last couple
42:41
years of being a student at OSU was when OSU was just literally getting
42:47
its feet wet in the oceans, doing the earliest, earliest work in ocean research.
42:56
So, I took some oceanography courses as an undergraduate, and it turned
43:01
out that later then those came back.
43:03
It was an interesting dimension to the science journalism.
43:07
Hmm.
43:08
So, did you get a minor in journalism, or just...?
43:12
Yeah, it amounted to that, but I don't think the university had
43:16
any way to call it that because the University of Oregon was so
43:20
protective about it owned journalism.
43:22
I see.
43:23
So, my next question is about the student organizations that you were involved in.
43:27
So, I - some of these pictures that I brought, is
43:32
that - I don't know how you say this in-
43:34
That's - Phi Kappa Tau is a fraternity, was a fraternity, and it was over
43:39
on 13th, just north of Monroe.
43:45
In fact, I think it was 127 NW 13th.
43:48
You have a thing for numbers [both laugh]
43:52
. Phi Kappa Tau was the fraternity to which my cousin had pledged, so when I
43:58
came here, this group saw me as what they called a legacy at that time.
44:04
You know, it's kind of like if I'd had a brother who was here and that person
44:08
had gone on, then I come as a little brother and it's - you're the legacy.
44:12
Well, that this group saw me as the legacy for my then deceased
44:17
cousin, and so they invited me to, you know, live there and pledge.
44:23
And it took me about less than one term to discover that fraternity living was not
44:31
for me; that it was, it was not serious enough, that scholarship didn't matter
44:37
particularly, it was more about playing around, and there was more horseplay and
44:42
stuff that just didn't resonate with me.
44:44
And so, before that fall term was - apparently I had - I was there long enough
44:50
to get my picture taken [Tasha laughs] , but before it was over I moved... I guess
44:56
I moved directly to Weatherford, which was where I lived - here's another number
45:01
- I lived in room 346 in Weatherford for the rest of my time at OSU.
45:07
Huh, that's interesting.
45:10
Got the same room all those years.
45:12
That's right.
45:12
That doesn't happen anymore, I don't think [Gwil laughs] . So
45:15
here, this is 1960, so you were an associate editor at The Barometer.
45:19
Mm-hmm.
45:20
I went through - Arden Olson, who I mentioned earlier,
45:25
you know, really was the person responsible for getting me into
45:30
the journalism program here, and work on The Barometer.
45:34
And in those days you began as a reporter when you enrolled in
45:42
J 111, the introductory course, and part of that coursework
45:47
was working on The Barometer, and then you'd turn in carbon copies
45:50
of what you wrote for The Barometer for Adelaide Lake to grade.
45:55
And Adelaide set high standards.
45:57
For example...
46:03
[laughs] if you misspelled a name, it was an automatic F [Tasha laughs] . So
46:08
you know, she - but she was clear and fair and all that sort of thing.
46:11
So anyway, I worked my way through a variety of roles, and somewhere on one
46:18
of these photocopies that you brought with you, it identified a role that I
46:25
had on The Barometer as sports editor.
46:27
Right, on this one from 1961.
46:28
And I had to laugh because Chuck Winstrom, who
46:32
was at that time The Barometer editor, found himself in a pinch when his sports
46:38
editor quit, and he needed somebody to be the sports editor, and he called on
46:43
me, and I think he made the assumption that I knew something about sports.
46:47
And for the life of me, and to this day, I know very little about sports.
46:51
I've never played them and I've never - I don't follow them on TV
46:56
or in the newspaper or anything.
46:57
And so, here I found myself [laughs] as The Barometer sports editor
47:02
and it was - I did my best in it.
47:07
I did my best, first of all, to dissuade him, but he insisted, so I took it on,
47:12
and what it meant was I got to sit in the press box at football games and
47:16
that sort of things, but he - I think he began having second thoughts when I
47:22
would - my stories about football games would report on how nice the uniforms
47:28
looked and [both laugh] and colorful the day was, and that sort of thing.
47:33
And as I recall, he soon found another person to be the sports editor.
47:38
I think it's so ironic that your teacher had this issue with misspelling, and here
47:42
your name is misspelled in the yearbook.
47:44
[Laughs] that's right [laughs]
47:44
. That's some funny irony for history's sake, isn't it?
47:47
So, this one must have been you - this is your senior year, in 1961.
47:51
Yes.
47:52
And it lists that you were, I guess, nominated or voted or somehow to
47:55
be an outstanding senior, they just picked you on this page.
47:59
But it lists the things that you were involved in.
48:02
I don't know if this is just your senior year or if this is
48:04
during your entire time at OSU.
48:07
It's quite an extensive list.
48:08
You were rather active here on campus.
48:10
I was active, yeah.
48:12
What is this Blue Key?
48:16
Blue Key still exists at OSU.
48:18
It's - Blue Key and Motor Board are senior honoraries, and so...
48:27
they select each year the people who have been
48:34
sort of self-identified by high grade point average and a lot of
48:39
involvement in student activities.
48:42
That tends to be who - and Blue Key was the male group, and Motor
48:48
Board was the women's group.
48:50
Sigma Delta Chi is a journalism honorary...
48:53
So, we have a journalism honorary at that time, but no journalism degree?
48:58
That's right, yep.
48:58
That's interesting.
48:59
Yep.
49:01
This - I was in the Student Senate, on the AMU Board of Directors.
49:05
I was on the Educational Activities Board by virtue of being The Barometer editor.
49:12
So, you were editor this year in 1961?
49:15
That's right, mm-hmm.
49:17
And that's what had me on the athletic board too.
49:19
The Barometer editor at that time was always a member of the OSU Athletic Board,
49:25
and then various other things that I just got - happened to get involved in.
49:29
And so, it looks like your photography was in the yearbook.
49:31
Yes.
49:32
I - well, and that happened... because until my senior year when
49:39
I was editor of The Barometer and paid - that was a paid role
49:45
- I had a part-time job the other two years, as a sophomore and junior,
49:53
as a photographer for Hise Studio, which was at that time - the business
50:00
still exists in town, but it was - it's different than it was.
50:04
Hise Studio, at that time, was a Corvallis-based business that
50:08
did about two-thirds of the photographs of all graduating high
50:15
school seniors throughout Oregon.
50:18
And so, I went to - I got acquainted with Frank Hise when I was in high school and
50:25
he learned that I was a photographer.
50:26
So, when I came here, he hired me, and I shot... for him, I shot all
50:34
of the Beaver activity photos, and the Beaver, the yearbook, contracted
50:39
with Hise Studio and Ball Studio.
50:42
They split the business to cover all the activities that went on at OSU,
50:47
so sporting events and social events and academic events and programs.
50:55
And Ball and Hise each would hire student photographers, and so I
51:00
worked for Frank Hise a lot, like 20, 30 hours a week sometimes.
51:10
And in the summertime we'd shoot 4-H summer school and that sort of thing.
51:16
So, it was - that's what got the Beaver photographer identification here.
51:21
I did house dances so that you know, you would go to the fraternity or sorority
51:28
and there would be all these people in their formals and so forth, and get a
51:32
group shot and then you take pictures of the individual couples and so forth.
51:37
So, I went to more social - I probably went to more social events
51:42
than anybody you could imagine, but not in a social way [both laugh]
51:47
. Right, you were a photographer.
51:50
At that time, did everybody pay for college outright?
51:53
Did they have loan programs?
51:57
Um...
52:01
hmm...
52:02
Did you take any loans to pay for college?
52:04
No, I didn't take any loans.
52:05
I pretty - but of course, you know, tuition was, I don't know...
52:12
seems like it was $83 a term.
52:15
Oh.
52:16
And then there would be, you know, housing and so forth.
52:20
That was when Oregon supported higher education on a very,
52:25
very appropriate manner, and
52:30
the state paid most every dollar for the cost of a person's education, and
52:37
it was at that time fully consistent with the land grant mission of
52:41
providing education for people - higher education - for people for whom it
52:47
might not otherwise be available.
52:49
I mean, that's the fundamental land grant mission, and it
52:52
really worked in those days.
52:53
So no, I think loans were available, and certainly scholarships were available,
52:59
but they were less important because of the way that the state fulfilled its
53:05
responsibilities in higher education.
53:08
Hmm.
53:09
So, how do you feel that student life was different when you
53:12
were in college, versus now?
53:14
I mean, this is obviously a big question, but what glaring things?
53:17
Oh, I think there's, there is probably... a greater degree of informality.
53:27
I think the - I think students are probably less intimidated by professors
53:34
and administrators and so forth.
53:38
For example, there was a Dean of Women here...
53:52
and I'm wrestling for - I... hmm, I have to think about her name, but
53:57
Dean of Women who pretty much was the
54:03
[laughs] , she was the keeper of morals for the campus.
54:10
And she - I'm pretty sure I want to say Helen Moore
54:19
[phonetic] - she saw to it that nothing untoward might go on that would sully the
54:25
reputation of the women, in particular.
54:29
So, that meant that there were - women never were allowed to wear jeans or
54:34
shorts on campus, and neither were they allowed to wear patent leather
54:40
shoes, because of the reflections.
54:43
Hmm.
54:44
And that if there was any sitting on laps to be done at any social event, there
54:52
were, in all of the living quarters, things called fussing pillows, and
54:58
it meant that if a girl were going to sit on a guy's lap, then you had
55:01
to get a fussing pillow, and the pillow would go on first, and then
55:05
the girl could sit on the guy's lap.
55:07
And those were dictated by the Dean of Women.
55:09
I mean, that's just an example of the sort of structure that was in - I
55:14
mean, there was very much this in loco parentis notion that the university
55:19
not only was about education but was very much about looking out for the
55:23
welfare and morals of its students.
55:26
And that was a time when
55:30
on-well, the president had decreed that there would be no alcohol
55:35
served by any business on Monroe Street, and that was honored by
55:39
the Corvallis business community.
55:41
And it was only a year or two after they had relaxed the rule, and prior
55:49
to that, there had been the rule that if you smoked, you had to go stand
55:52
on the north side of Monroe street.
55:54
Hmm.
55:55
That's far [laughs]
55:55
. So, it was that; it was that kind of, you know, it was that kind of environment.
55:58
It was also an environment where you couldn't browse the stacks in the
56:02
library; that you would go to the card catalog and select the book or books that
56:08
you were interested in, write those on a form that was nearby, carry that to the
56:15
seemingly elderly ladies at the desk, who would then go into the stacks and
56:20
retrieve your book and bring it to you at the table, all the while making sure
56:26
that you didn't speak loudly [both laugh]
56:29
. So, life was definitely different at that time.
56:32
So, what was the cultural environment here in regards to
56:35
homosexuality, for men or for women?
56:37
Was it, was it ever talked about?
56:39
Did you know of any gay people here on campus at that time?
56:43
I don't - I think we all pretended like it didn't exist.
56:48
I mean, when I was a student here.
56:49
I really - I do not remember anything in that era that
56:57
related to gay people.
56:59
But-
56:59
I mean, it was as if there weren't any.
57:02
Was there a cultural message that it just wasn't accepted?
57:05
I mean, were there - you know, you still hear this today sometimes, you know,
57:09
boys will joke oh, you're being queer-
57:11
Mm-hmm.
57:11
-as if that's a derogatory thing.
57:13
Mm-hmm.
57:13
So, was that the case then, that that was - it was a derogatory...?
57:18
I don't think it even came up.
57:20
Um...
57:22
Was it like nobody-
57:22
It just wasn't on the radar screen.
57:24
I mean, the sexuality things that were on the radar screen at that time
57:28
was that there was a professor, um... Kirkendall in the - I think he was in
57:37
the Psychology Department, who - he did some studies on human sexuality, and
57:48
I used to do, serve as a stringer for The Oregonian when I was here, too, and so
57:55
I would be in the news, university news bureau, college news bureau, and there
57:59
would be debates in the news bureau about oh my god, Lester Kirkendall just went to
58:05
the American Psychological Association and gave a paper; do we dare report on that?
58:13
Because it was about human sexuality, and my goodness, would we ever want
58:18
to acknowledge that there is such a thing [both laugh] ? You know, and
58:22
[stumbles] , and if the news bureau did do a story, you could count on there
58:27
being a lot of criticism because kind of like how dare we talk about that.
58:33
So, on either, whether it's heterosexual or-
58:35
Exactly.
58:35
It just wasn't discussed.
58:36
Exactly, yep.
58:37
That's interesting.
58:39
So, you graduated in 1961 from OSU.
58:42
I did, yeah.
58:42
And then what did you do?
58:44
Then I went to work for the Associated Press and worked as a desk editor.
58:50
Where was that?
58:51
In Portland.
58:52
And the - and that was a delight because it was a total immersion in
59:00
professional journalism, and I had outstanding supervisors...
59:09
and... and it was - the Associated Press was fun to work for because at that time,
59:20
and it's still true, they talk about a deadline every minute, which means that
59:26
this is a news organization that is serving newspapers and radio stations and
59:30
TV all around the world, and actually, in relation to newspapers, somewhere
59:37
in the world there was a newspaper that was going to press at that moment.
59:42
So, in that context of a deadline every minute, it meant that news was volatile
59:49
and it had a time value, and so the people who worked for the Associated
59:55
Press needed to not let news get old, lest one of their member newspapers
1:00:03
or other members not get news that they could have used in a timely way.
1:00:10
So, working in that kind of high-pressure environment was a
1:00:13
delight with good supervision.
1:00:15
At that time, we sent the news by wire.
1:00:20
So, the newsroom character - and I worked mornings in The Oregonian newsroom in the
1:00:29
Associated Press office there, afternoons in The Oregon Journal newsroom, which
1:00:35
was several blocks away in Portland.
1:00:39
And so, you're surrounded not only by Associated Press writers and editors,
1:00:44
but surrounded by the writers and editors for two really good newspapers.
1:00:49
So, it was a great way to learn and be part of a network.
1:00:54
The thing I loved about that, and that was fascinating, was sending news by
1:00:59
wire means that you've got - and the AP had several different wires, like the
1:01:03
sports wire and the general news wire and the Oregon wire and so forth - every one
1:01:10
of those had to have - was the news was sent from a different, different device.
1:01:16
And there were union telegraphers who would take your - to whom you would
1:01:21
hand your copy, and these guys usually were... were cigar smokers, and so
1:01:29
they'd have a cigar dangling out of the corner of their mouths, and they
1:01:32
were, tended to be cynical, and I soon - one of the things I'd learned
1:01:38
early was that their union contract said that they could not be subjected
1:01:43
to any whistling in the newsroom.
1:01:45
And I mean, there are all - so, it's just a strange, interesting place.
1:01:50
And these machines were incredibly noisy, clackety, clackety, clackety, [Tasha
1:01:54
groans] clackety, as news was coming in and news was going out, and so forth.
1:01:59
And so, I got to work there and pretty much - with supervision - but there
1:02:06
were points at which I was the only person on for the AP, and so I'd write
1:02:11
whatever was the current news story, and out of my typewriter with page one,
1:02:17
while I'm still writing page two, and handing it back over my shoulder to a
1:02:22
telegrapher behind me who is sitting there sending it out on the teletype.
1:02:28
And they used to love to get ahead of me.
1:02:34
They wouldn't get - they wouldn't be able to get ahead of the professional
1:02:37
writers who were there, but they would love to get ahead of this new kid
1:02:40
on the block [Tasha laughs] and then give me a bad time about not keeping
1:02:43
up with them, in terms of my writing.
1:02:45
So, it really forced me to learn to write in this environment that was a
1:02:49
smoke-filled room with lots of noise, people talking, phones ringing all over,
1:02:54
and you just had to be really focused on what it was that you were about.
1:02:59
And how long did you do that?
1:03:01
I did that until, just for a relatively short time because I then
1:03:06
went to Stanford for graduate work
1:03:11
and it was that fall, I don't remember when we started, but
1:03:14
you know, it was probably four months or something like that.
1:03:16
So, you went to Stanford; did you get a master's degree in journalism?
1:03:20
Uh-huh.
1:03:20
Yeah, well actually in...
1:03:24
in communication research.
1:03:27
The folks in journalism here had really encouraged me to do graduate work, and
1:03:37
I had a choice of going to the University of Wisconsin, Madison in Agricultural
1:03:42
Journalism, and there was a person here who was a graduate of there and
1:03:47
was an advocate for that, and then the other choice I had was going
1:03:51
to Stanford, and there was a person here who was a graduate of Stanford,
1:03:55
and he was an advocate for that.
1:03:57
And I didn't really - having come out of a family that did not have - I
1:04:01
mean, I was the first person who had gone to college and I didn't have the
1:04:05
benefit of understanding really how universities worked or what graduate
1:04:10
education meant and all that, so it was more - I think my choice was more - I
1:04:17
mean, today I would make the choice about it on a programmatic basis;
1:04:20
well, do I want to go into agricultural journalism, do I want to go into, at
1:04:25
that time, communication research?
1:04:29
I'd make a programmatic decision.
1:04:31
I think then, California weather was just [Tasha laughs] way better sounding
1:04:37
than Wisconsin weather, you know?
1:04:39
That's - I was just going to say, it's about the weather, isn't it?
1:04:40
Exactly, exactly.
1:04:40
I saw that one coming [laughs]
1:04:41
. Yeah, exactly.
1:04:44
But, so I went to Stanford that it truly wasn't about journalism.
1:04:49
It was about communication research, which was based on psychology and sociology, and
1:04:55
statistics, and actual research practice, and with some outstanding teachers.
1:05:03
Wilbur Schramm was the leading communication theorist in the
1:05:08
world at that time and he was
1:05:13
there.
1:05:13
Merrill Samuelson was there doing some outstanding work on adoption, and Quinn
1:05:22
McNemar was a psychological statistician doing some remarkable work there, and
1:05:32
Leon Festinger was there and he had just developed his theory of cognitive
1:05:36
dissonance, so I got to take courses and do work with all those wonderful
1:05:40
people, and it was a great experience.
1:05:43
Really great.
1:05:44
So, your master's is in communication research?
1:05:46
That's right, mm-hmm.
1:05:47
And what year did you get that degree?
1:05:50
I was - I got, I did it on a fast-paced schedule and got that in...
1:06:01
in '62.
1:06:01
And I don't remember the month because it was - they grant degrees
1:06:06
in - advanced degrees, at that time, on a different schedule.
1:06:09
Hmm.
1:06:11
And so, did you go right into the military from there?
1:06:13
I did.
1:06:13
That was Vietnam War era and I was on deferment, so it was a case of either
1:06:20
be drafted or go into the military, and so this kind of fit with the - you
1:06:26
asked earlier what was the model in those days - and so, I think part of
1:06:30
it was, you know, well graduate from school, get married, get a job, do
1:06:38
your military obligation, if that we were presently involved, and military
1:06:42
obligation was indeed very present.
1:06:44
And so, I chose to enlist, and I chose to-
1:06:49
Oh, so you weren't drafted?
1:06:49
No, I chose to enlist in the Air Force, in large part because their recruiter made it
1:06:59
sound like I could do what I wanted to do
1:07:04
and truly could go through the officer training school
1:07:07
and emerge with a commission.
1:07:09
And I did that and actually emerged with a regular commission, as opposed
1:07:16
to a reserve commission, which is what most people emerged from that with.
1:07:20
Regular commission goes to a few people who are selected because
1:07:25
the military believes that they want them as career people.
1:07:30
So, I had a regular commission, which worked to my advantage
1:07:34
in the Air Force, and
1:07:38
I immediately, after officer training school, went to Rapid City, South Dakota,
1:07:45
and within about a month moved into a slot as the director of information for
1:07:56
that Air Force base.
1:07:59
And it was a slot that called for a full colonel, and I was a second
1:08:03
lieutenant as director of information.
1:08:06
And it was an important military base because it was the Strategic Air
1:08:15
Command's largest military base that had B-52 bombers, KC-135 tankers,
1:08:23
Titan 1 missiles, and my job was to
1:08:29
get the farmers around that area into a frame of mind such that
1:08:34
they didn't mind our planning 150
1:08:38
minuteman missiles on their land; digging holes, silos, and running cables across
1:08:43
their land and that sort of thing.
1:08:45
So, I had the community relations responsibility for the installation of
1:08:51
the 150 nuclear-tipped minuteman missiles.
1:08:55
And as a second lieutenant in a colonel's job, that is, you
1:09:00
know, that was a big challenge.
1:09:02
And I, once again, I had great mentors.
1:09:05
Really, really good mentors that, to this day, still give them
1:09:09
credit for things that I use now.
1:09:12
And so, got to do that in Rapid City, and then
1:09:20
the sort of culmination of that was after we got these in the ground, somebody
1:09:24
at the headquarters said, "you know, we ought to make sure that these work."
1:09:29
[Surprised] oh [laughs]
1:09:30
. And so, we had the first launch of an operation minuteman missile
1:09:36
from an operational site, because always before they had been tested
1:09:40
at Vandenberg Air Force Base.
1:09:41
So, this is the first time ever a minuteman, which was really the major
1:09:46
missile for the strategic defense of the United States during the Cold War,
1:09:51
we had the first launch of one of those missiles from an operational site, to
1:09:56
demonstrate... mainly to demonstrate to Russia that we could do it.
1:10:01
And so, this missile was just like all the other missiles, except that
1:10:06
they didn't put as much fuel in it.
1:10:08
So, on March 1st of 1965, we had the world's press gathered there, and
1:10:17
my job was media relations for that.
1:10:21
And so, there was all kinds of build-up, and Time Magazine, Life Magazine were
1:10:25
there, and all the major networks and big long lenses on a cold winter
1:10:31
day on the South Dakota prairie.
1:10:34
And so, a lot of hoop-dee-doo leading up to it, and then the thing, you know,
1:10:40
[laughs] the way they actually get there, you fire it - I mean, there's these guys
1:10:44
underground in the capsule and they get the command and they fire it - and sure
1:10:47
enough up it comes, and it, you know, flies up and it's quite spectacular, and
1:10:51
then it runs out of fuel and falls to the ground, and it all happens in maybe - it's
1:10:55
all over [Tasha laughs] in 15 seconds or something, you know [both laugh]
1:10:58
. It's kind of like Christmas morning, isn't it?
1:10:59
That's right [laughs]
1:10:59
. And where did it fall?
1:11:01
It just fell downrange on some more of South Dakota prairie.
1:11:04
Oh.
1:11:04
I mean, it fell right where we thought it was going to fall.
1:11:08
But it was a fascinating thing.
1:11:10
And I got to work with Jules Bergman from ABC News and National Geographic,
1:11:16
and then that was a success, so I got invited to go work at the Strategic
1:11:21
Air Command Headquarters in Omaha and moved there and had more good
1:11:27
sup-really good supervision and...
1:11:33
nice experiences.
1:11:34
I got to do national media relations and work with more of the national media, and
1:11:43
did that until '66.
1:11:46
And in the meantime, I had developed early-onset rheumatoid arthritis
1:11:50
that was really giving me a lot of problems those days, and they put
1:11:53
me on a temporary disability retired list while they watched my case.
1:11:58
And it's not unusual for people to get that in their twenties,
1:12:01
and then it goes into remission.
1:12:03
And...
1:12:06
so... the long and the short of it was that about the time I went on
1:12:12
temporary disability retired list, a job opened up here are Oregon - two
1:12:16
jobs opened up here at Oregon state, and they invited me to come out
1:12:21
and interview for those, and I did.
1:12:23
And then I got my choice of which to take and took one of them,
1:12:29
and the rest is history [laughs]
1:12:31
. Well, there were two things that I was going to ask about later, but
1:12:34
this is probably the right time.
1:12:35
So, what did you think about the Vietnam War?
1:12:38
It was interesting because you were in the military in that time and...
1:12:42
Well,
1:12:46
I was in the - I was in Strategic Air Command Headquarters when the first
1:12:52
B-52 strategic bombers - and mind you these are bombers designed to fly
1:12:59
into Russia and attack targets there, carrying nuclear weapons - and so what
1:13:05
happened in the Vietnam War was, I mean, we know the war was one for which the
1:13:12
United States was not well-equipped, and so they were trying everything, and
1:13:17
so they decided that they were going to use B-52s flying out of Guam to
1:13:22
attack insurgent targets in Vietnam with
1:13:28
essentially heavy conventional bomb loans, much like World War II.
1:13:36
So, here they're repurposing these strategic bombers to do the
1:13:44
counterinsurgency attacks, which in my estimation were never very successful,
1:13:47
but it was interesting because... we would get the aerial pictures, the
1:13:56
motion pictures of these attacks, back at headquarters within a few hours of when
1:14:02
they were actually made in Vietnam, that they'd rush them back by high-speed jets.
1:14:07
And so, that - and so, I was often involved in the screening of those images
1:14:15
of the bombings and so on, and it made the war certainly very much, very real.
1:14:26
And...
1:14:28
I think that - I often - I... I, certainly at the time, bought into the notion
1:14:35
which was the United States' line at that time, which was if we don't stop
1:14:40
them in Vietnam, the communists will just continue on, you know, marching on
1:14:45
down, and the next we know they'll be in Australia and New Zealand or whatever.
1:14:49
So, the communist threat was really big then, and that was part of the,
1:14:54
was part of the military strategy, was to counter that communist threat
1:15:00
as perceived by the United States.
1:15:02
And you know, I guess at that time I was ready to believe that that was true.
1:15:07
I mean, a guy in my twenties, I'm no expert at that.
1:15:10
You presume that you - and you hear this from your bosses and
1:15:14
presume that they must know what they're talking about and so on.
1:15:16
But it did seem, I think even - I think even that early the futility of the
1:15:21
war seemed... seemed to be present.
1:15:24
I don't know that we talked about it a lot at the time, but there were so many
1:15:29
reports of things that didn't work, even - and I had a very high security
1:15:34
clearance, so I saw top secret and certain higher-level documents that would...
1:15:44
you know, if you had any skepticism at all, it would probably fuel that.
1:15:48
And how do you think that this experience affected how you view our country's
1:15:53
foreign policy decisions today?
1:16:02
...Well, I'm not sure I've really thought about that.
1:16:05
Um...
1:16:07
People must ask you, though.
1:16:08
You've been in, you know, [stumbles] - you know, you've been in Vietnam,
1:16:11
you were involved at that time, and the lessons that it seems like you've
1:16:14
learned about fighting wars and-
1:16:15
Yeah, I was never in Vietnam.
1:16:18
I was always - I mean, I was, you know, relating to it from a headquarters,
1:16:23
but I am a Vietnam era veteran and...
1:16:32
I think maybe what I've learned, and truly agree with when I see
1:16:38
in actions today, is that military force is really the last thing that
1:16:46
you resort to, not an early thing to resort to, and that especially in
1:16:53
this world it's so much more important to be about finding diplomatic
1:17:00
solutions, and working together and finding commonalities and being
1:17:05
patient and not being sword rattlers.
1:17:08
For one thing, there seems to be more and more wars of insurgency like - and Vietnam
1:17:16
was the perfect example of that - but
1:17:20
an organized military force is not effective against insurgencies.
1:17:27
I mean, it's very expensive, and so it's very expensive and not very effective, and
1:17:34
so one doesn't want to... one wants to do everything you can to exhaust all other
1:17:41
possibilities before you ever get to that.
1:17:45
So, at the same time is when President Kennedy was shot.
1:17:48
Mm-hmm.
1:17:49
Where were you when that happened?
1:17:50
I actually was on leave in Portland, and I think that's like
1:17:54
45 years ago tomorrow, isn't it?
1:17:56
I don't remember the date exactly.
1:17:57
Kind of seems to me that's the case.
1:18:01
But I was on leave from...
1:18:07
somewhere.
1:18:08
Well, that was '63 right?
1:18:09
Sixty-three...
1:18:09
And so, it seems like in '63, were you - in '63 you would
1:18:13
have been in Rapid City still.
1:18:14
Yeah, I think I had - I was on leave from there and I was in Portland and I was
1:18:20
staying in a motel with my folks because I had just gotten home, and I think maybe
1:18:26
they had met me in Portland and we stayed at a hotel overnight before going home,
1:18:33
and it was - it was in that hotel that we turned on the television and got the news.
1:18:39
And then I remember calling back to the base to see if that meant I should
1:18:47
terminate my leave and go back, and they said no, that that wasn't necessary.
1:18:50
But yeah, I remember that pretty clearly.
1:18:53
And did that have an effect on you?
1:18:55
Well, I think the same kind of effect it had on anybody who respected
1:18:59
John Kennedy, it was what a tragedy.
1:19:01
I mean, because in many ways this, the election of Barack
1:19:05
Obama, is for me reminiscent of the election of John Kennedy.
1:19:13
He was elected when I was Barometer editor, and I just remember the feeling
1:19:19
on the campus at that time was one of hope and enthusiasm and connection with
1:19:25
a young, younger man, and a man who offered promise and so forth, and very
1:19:31
much the thing I've seen with the Obama
1:19:36
election.
1:19:38
And so, it was just this great sorrow.
1:19:43
And I remember, not real clearly, but I do remember when Franklin
1:19:47
Roosevelt died and how my family felt.
1:19:51
I mean, I was a little kid them but I remember how my family felt then.
1:19:54
It was that same feeling, really.
1:19:57
And we didn't really talk about this before, but how did
1:19:59
you experience World War II?
1:20:00
Obviously, you were young, but where does it fit into your memory?
1:20:04
Well...
1:20:08
my - several members of my family, male members of my family, were called to war,
1:20:16
some drafted, some volunteered, whatever.
1:20:20
My mother's - no, my dad's sister's husband went in as
1:20:28
a Navy officer and served on several ships during World War II.
1:20:35
My dad was drafted, but he went into the Marine Corps, and he
1:20:42
served in the Marines during World War II, but not for a long time.
1:20:47
He was a later - because he was older at the time, he - they didn't draft him until
1:20:53
they needed to draft older people [Tasha laughs] . And he - and I think the people
1:20:57
who were in his same Marine company, or whatever the unit was called, called
1:21:03
him Dad [Tasha laughs] . I mean, he was enough that, you know, he may have been
1:21:07
10 years older or five years old, but it was that kind of... And then my mom's
1:21:12
younger brother was drafted - actually, I don't know that he was drafted, but
1:21:19
he went in right after high school.
1:21:22
He went into the Army in World War II.
1:21:25
He had a scholarship to Harvard which could have deferred him, and instead,
1:21:32
he volunteered for the Army and was killed in the Pacific a short time later.
1:21:38
And he was a favorite uncle for me.
1:21:40
He was a real neat young man.
1:21:45
So, those are the kinds - and so I - there were periods when many of the men in
1:21:53
our family were in the war, and so I remember my mom and myself being alone in
1:22:01
the, where we lived, and then my dad's sister spending a lot of time with us.
1:22:08
And actually, growing up through those several years with my mom and my aunt,
1:22:14
who always had fun together and laughed a lot and everything, was - I mean,
1:22:20
even in their later years just before they died, we would, when we were
1:22:25
together, we would all laugh about good times that we had together and crazy
1:22:30
things that these two women would do,
1:22:35
I mean to entertain me or whatever.
1:22:37
So yeah, it was - there were scary times.
1:22:41
I mean, I remember much of that time every night was blackout, so you weren't
1:22:48
allowed to drive cars a lot, but if you did, you'd turn on the headlights at
1:22:52
night and there would be like a half-inch slit through which the lights would
1:22:59
shine, and that was all that you were allowed to show because there might be
1:23:03
Japanese airplanes overhead or something.
1:23:05
Yeah, it seemed that that was a time when there was real fear,
1:23:10
even here on our mainland, of
1:23:13
- Oh absolutely.
1:23:13
-attack.
1:23:14
Absolutely.
1:23:15
Yeah, that when - after the war and when we moved to the coast, the people
1:23:21
who lived in the Nelscott, now Lincoln City area, talked about how they had
1:23:27
assigned people who lived there who would take turns walking the beach at
1:23:32
night looking for Japanese invaders.
1:23:35
Mm.
1:23:35
Yeah,
1:23:38
it was, it was very much in evidence.
1:23:43
So, we kind of got a little distracted there because I wanted to get
1:23:45
those things in where they fit.
1:23:47
So, when you were in the military, it's kind of that same question about when
1:23:50
you were at OSU; was there any cultural message homosexuality at that time?
1:23:56
Was it discussed?
1:23:58
Well yes, you bet.
1:24:01
I mean, it was - first of all, when you went in, you had to fill out a
1:24:06
form that inquired about your sexual history, and you know, and as I recall,
1:24:15
the question was are you now or have you ever been a homosexual, or are you
1:24:20
now or have you ever engaged, or do you now or have you ever engaged in
1:24:24
homosexual activities and so forth.
1:24:26
I mean, it was that explicit.
1:24:28
And...
1:24:30
And if you said yes?
1:24:31
Then you were out.
1:24:32
They wouldn't take you.
1:24:33
I mean it was that... it was that... and but of course that carried then
1:24:39
with it all kinds of social stigma that, I mean, so what do I do, go home and
1:24:44
tell my mom that you know, well they sent me back because I'm a homosexual?
1:24:51
You know, and my guess is that probably most, most people growing up have sexual
1:25:01
activities with people of the same sex.
1:25:03
You know, it's part of experimentation.
1:25:05
So, now you're confronted with a military form that asks, and then you're going
1:25:11
oh geez, did that time ever - does that [Tasha laughs] , is that what they mean?
1:25:12
And so forth, you know.
1:25:12
Right.
1:25:15
And so, from day one it's made clear that that's not appropriate.
1:25:22
Now
1:25:25
I didn't really encounter it until - I mean encounter it
1:25:30
really in any substantive way.
1:25:32
I mean, in training they tell you that that's not allowed and so forth
1:25:36
and that we don't have homosexual people in the military and so forth,
1:25:40
but I didn't really encounter it until I was a squadron commander for
1:25:47
the 821st Combat Support Group at Ellsworth, which was a job
1:25:52
I had in addition to being director of information, you know.
1:25:56
So, it's just like around here, that you often find yourself
1:25:59
with multiple jobs [Tasha laughs]
1:26:00
. And so, I was a squadron commander for this unit of, I
1:26:04
think we 600 people, and... and
1:26:12
for the most part, that kind of a squadron is run by the... the
1:26:17
NCOs, the noncommissioned officers, the senior master sergeants, and
1:26:21
chief master sergeants and so on.
1:26:23
They'd been running them for years and, you know, here's a new lieutenant
1:26:27
who doesn't know nearly as much as they do and you - so, you have to
1:26:30
trust them a lot and everything.
1:26:32
So, I remember though, I hadn't been squadron commander for very long until
1:26:36
one of the chief master sergeants brought to my attention that he had
1:26:41
identified these two young men who were...
1:26:48
I don't remember how he would have framed it, but they were roommates and he had
1:26:52
determined that they were homosexual.
1:26:55
And so, it was therefore up to me to deal with that.
1:27:00
And the regulation had a number.
1:27:05
I don't remember what it was but it's the homo-the regulation deals
1:27:08
with not having homosexuals in the military and all the fine print
1:27:12
related to that, and it was something like - I don't remember the first
1:27:15
digits, but it was like 12-69, is the-
1:27:20
[Laughs] interesting choice.
1:27:21
Is - yeah, exactly.
1:27:22
And so, he brought these two young men in and we talked and they confirmed that
1:27:30
they had had homosexual relations, and so he gave them a choice of do they... did
1:27:41
they want to fight it or did they - were they going - you know, fight a discharge,
1:27:45
or would they sign the papers and so on.
1:27:48
And we discharged them, and I remember signing the papers as the
1:27:51
squadron commander as a dishonorable discharge for these two gay guys.
1:27:55
It was fir-I think it was the first time that I knew that I was really talking
1:28:01
to somebody who was gay, and the word, I don't think gay ever appeared.
1:28:06
I think it was always homosexual.
1:28:07
But - and you know, and I'm - so, I'm sitting there, and probably aware of
1:28:15
my own inclinations but not ever really having acted on those, and yet - and
1:28:21
having great empathy for these two men and thinking about the trag-and
1:28:26
that was a very difficult - I mean, especially in retrospect, that was
1:28:30
a difficult one to process, was so how is that, how's all that sort out.
1:28:36
And actually, I think for me the temporary disability retirement, based on the
1:28:43
health condition, came at a good time because, had I stayed in, it would become
1:28:48
more and more apparent to me that it was a conflict of interest and, and that,
1:28:53
you know, it would have been a great career had that not been in the way.
1:28:57
And what do you feel...
1:29:02
This is not on my list, but it just came up, like what do you think
1:29:05
is the most appropriate way that the military should - what kind of
1:29:09
policy should the military have?
1:29:11
They should forget it.
1:29:12
They should, they - it's kind of like they ought to be like Israel or
1:29:17
anybody else of the more progressive militaries, is you know, turn loose of it.
1:29:24
It's not a big deal.
1:29:26
And I mean, it's been established more, in more and more military
1:29:33
situation-and there's even advocates among very senior military people in
1:29:37
the United States that it's like - and I think Obama actually, I think Obama,
1:29:41
during his presidency, it'll go away.
1:29:44
So, there should just be no policy about it?
1:29:45
That it's-
1:29:46
Yeah, I mean it's kind of like...
1:29:50
do we have policy against blue eyes or brown hair, or...
1:29:56
Right.
1:29:56
You know?
1:29:58
I mean, the military was the first place, under Harry Truman, where
1:30:01
they said we're not going to make any distinction about people of color.
1:30:08
And it's kind of like do the same thing here.
1:30:12
But we still have "don't ask, don't tell," technically, right?
1:30:15
Oh, we do now, yeah.
1:30:16
That's what I think ought to be gotten rid of, and get rid of
1:30:20
regular number such-and-so 69.
1:30:22
Whatever it is at this point.
1:30:24
Yeah, uh-huh.
1:30:25
Yeah.
1:30:25
So, so you were talking about coming back to OSU.
1:30:29
So, you were offered these two positions; what were those two positions?
1:30:33
One was as assistant editor for the Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station,
1:30:39
which would be a science journalism kind of job, and the other was a
1:30:45
split appointment in the Department of Journalism to teach journalism, and
1:30:50
the other half of that was to do public information work for the university.
1:30:56
And which one did you pick?
1:30:57
I took the second one.
1:30:58
Uh-huh.
1:30:59
And so, I was teaching journalism and doing public information work, and it
1:31:06
just - that was a good fit, although it was interesting that as time went by...
1:31:15
and I moved through various positions, I then had the editor and the assistant
1:31:23
editor for the Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station reporting to me;
1:31:29
that there was a convergence [laughs] , sort of, of careers there, such that
1:31:36
the job that I didn't take ended up being one that I was the supervisor for.
1:31:41
[Laughs] that's interesting.
1:31:43
So, you've been here at OSU for over 40 years, and what are some of the
1:31:47
other positions that you've had?
1:31:50
Well, a lot of interesting positions, and I think when - see, when I came
1:31:54
here, I really didn't know I was going to stay here this long, and were it
1:31:57
not for continuing to have a lot of interesting opportunities, were it not
1:32:04
for that, I might not still be here.
1:32:07
So, early on I was doing those two jobs, general public information
1:32:14
work for the university...
1:32:16
And teaching journalism.
1:32:16
And teaching journalism...
1:32:18
Is that the only time you taught here?
1:32:21
Well, that's another - we can come back to that one.
1:32:25
Okay.
1:32:28
But the, the half time that was not about teaching journalism got me into
1:32:36
starting a new quarterly newsletter for the university called OSU Scope, and
1:32:42
I was the editor and publisher of that for the whole time that it was published
1:32:47
which was, I don't know, several years.
1:32:50
And then that got me to being - I guess that called attention to what
1:32:56
I was doing with that newsletter at a time when the alumni association lost
1:33:02
the editor of The Oregon Stater, and so they asked me if I would become
1:33:07
the editor of the alumni magazine.
1:33:09
So, I did that, and at the same time this, the work that was going on
1:33:19
in the... in the oceans was growing here a lot, and since I had taken those
1:33:25
several oceanography classes some years before, I was really the only person at
1:33:30
the time who had a combination of science writing and a background in oceanography,
1:33:33
some background in oceanography.
1:33:36
And so, they needed a public information rep, so I started doing public
1:33:41
information work for the then-brand-new OSU Marine Science Center at Newport-
1:33:46
Wow.
1:33:47
-and the Department of Oceanography, which was then a department, not a college.
1:33:52
And that was fascinating, and so I did stuff like get certified as a diver so I
1:33:57
could go out and dive with the research divers and take underwater pictures and
1:34:02
that sort of thing and broadcast - I remember broadcasting from the bridge
1:34:07
of one of our research vessels when we were on top of a mountain off the coast
1:34:12
of Washington that is as big as Mt. Hood and comes to within 100 feet of
1:34:16
the surface, and so I was sending radio broadcasts back from there about our work.
1:34:21
And so, you know, in every one of those jobs I found myself meeting
1:34:27
neat people, and my network around the university grew, and it was just
1:34:32
there was all kinds of rewards in that.
1:34:37
Then Bill Wick, who was an extension agent in Tillamook County, and Roy
1:34:45
Young, who was then the Dean of Research here - he was a botanist and he's still
1:34:53
alive in town - he went on to be the acting president of the university
1:34:58
for a while, but Bill Wick, Roy Young, Herb Frolander, an oceanographer...
1:35:05
and Emery Castle, who was in Ag.
1:35:10
Econ., and I worked on developing the proposal that led to OSU's being named
1:35:17
one of the first sea grant colleges in the country, along with Texas
1:35:23
A&M and University of Rhode Island.
1:35:26
And so, once we were named that, they needed somebody to do public information
1:35:30
work, so I was named as the first director of communications for the Sea
1:35:35
Grant Program, which then introd-got me introduced - I'd never really had much
1:35:42
to do with Cooperative Extension before that, but I - through that, I became
1:35:47
acquainted with Cooperate Extension, and within, I don't know, maybe two or
1:35:54
three years, then Cooperative Extension asked me if I would become the leader
1:36:01
of their communications program.
1:36:05
So, I migrated out of the Sea Grant Program and into being department head
1:36:11
for communications for OSU Extension.
1:36:15
And then, while I was doing that, we changed deans here, and the dean in the
1:36:22
- Ernie Briskey, new dean here, said, "I'm merging the Extension communications unit
1:36:29
with the Agricultural Experiment Station communications, and I want you to be the
1:36:34
head of that department." So, I was head of the Extension communications department
1:36:39
for 10 years and head of the Ag.
1:36:41
Communication department for 10 years.
1:36:44
And then, during that time, the president of the university
1:36:50
was faced with the retirement of the director of University Publications,
1:36:54
long-time director Ken Munford.
1:36:57
And he retired - he was also the director of the University Press,
1:37:01
the scholarly book publishing arm.
1:37:03
So, the university president,
1:37:08
Robert MacVicar, then said, "I would like to have you be director of University
1:37:15
Publications, director of the University Press, while you continue to be department
1:37:20
head." So, I took on those roles and did that for a while, all the while
1:37:26
kind of - I think both he and I knew that he wanted me to look after...
1:37:34
he wanted me to look after some things that needed to be done in
1:37:38
those two units that were overdue.
1:37:42
It kind of needed to be disrupted a little bit and changed around.
1:37:48
And so, I did that and then relinquished.
1:37:51
It was just - it was - I was working... I've never been reluctant to work
1:37:56
long hours, but I was working way too long hours, and so got them to pretty
1:38:00
much where he wanted them to be and then stepped from those and continued
1:38:04
as department head until '92 when
1:38:10
I got offered another job, which was to head the OSU Foundation.
1:38:16
And the people here in the College of Ag.
1:38:21
Sciences said, "Wait a minute, we don't want him to leave." So, they
1:38:25
offered me a job to head up a variety of things here in the dean's office,
1:38:30
and so I had two job offers, and really the one here was just more attractive.
1:38:36
So, I came over here in '92, and I've been up to a lot of things here since then.
1:38:44
Which of those positions have you enjoyed the most, and why?
1:38:50
I think I enjoyed whatever one I was in the most.
1:38:54
I mean really, truly, they've all been fun.
1:38:56
And not, not without their own - their challenges, and not without their down
1:39:01
moments and that sort of thing, but I think my philosophy has been this
1:39:09
business of follow your passion, you know?
1:39:11
And so, if you're doing it, you better be passionate about, and therefore,
1:39:15
if you're passionate about it, it's probably got some rewards and has fun.
1:39:19
And in fact, I always try to make my job fun.
1:39:22
So,
1:39:27
I wouldn't pick one out as better than another.
1:39:30
I mean, at the moment probably the best is the one I'm in, and it's
1:39:35
just I've got great people to work with and a lot of - there's a lot of
1:39:39
important challenges that we're facing.
1:39:41
We're facing, as always, ever limit-tighter budgets and so forth.
1:39:46
We've got tremendous people in this college.
1:39:49
I've learned from everybody I work with, and...
1:39:54
Now, that said, there was a moment when...
1:40:04
I was asked to be the - principal investigator was the official
1:40:10
name, but it was essentially project director - for a...
1:40:17
for a grant that we had, a project that we had in partnership with the
1:40:23
W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and this was in the nine-early nineteen-nineties.
1:40:28
I wrote the proposal to them and had the support of John
1:40:32
Byrne, who was president, and...
1:40:37
our dean then, C.J. Weiser, director of the Experiment Station Thayne
1:40:42
Dutson, Emery Castle, who I mentioned earlier, had the support of all those
1:40:50
people, and Roy Arnold, who was, at that time, was the Provost, all of
1:40:55
those people supported our getting this grant from the Kellogg Foundation.
1:40:59
And the foundation said, "We're going to select 10 land-grant universities
1:41:04
in which we are going to invest major money to help them prepare to do - better
1:41:09
do their job in the 21st century."
1:41:12
And so, there, as you might imagine, there were a lot of
1:41:15
universities competing for that.
1:41:16
We were one of the original ones selected and I had the privilege of
1:41:20
being then the project director for that.
1:41:22
And it was about - it was really about cultural
1:41:25
transformation for the university.
1:41:28
And
1:41:31
what I discovered, soon discovered, was that no one had a clue about how
1:41:35
to transform culture in a university.
1:41:38
And so, there were - that meant... that meant that for me there
1:41:44
was some real downtimes because Kellogg was not directive.
1:41:48
It is never directive with its grants, so they give you a lot of
1:41:52
latitude and framework within which to work, and a lot of latitude.
1:41:57
There was down, many downtimes for me because I felt like
1:42:02
once we got the grant, the people were sort of patting me on the head
1:42:05
and saying "well, there, there, good luck with your grant," and yet it was
1:42:10
really about the whole university.
1:42:12
And so, going from some pretty downtimes, we started sorting out that what
1:42:16
Oregon State most needed was a better capability to build relationships
1:42:26
- excuse me - relationships within the institution such that there was
1:42:32
improved communication, there was a cultural norm of make commitments and
1:42:38
keep them, and a recognition that the informal system of the university is
1:42:45
really what keeps it alive and vital.
1:42:48
So, what we ended up doing then was bringing in a corporate trainer by
1:42:53
the name of Paul Axtell to conduct a series of two or three-day workshops
1:42:59
for faculty, staff, and students, all of which would be voluntary.
1:43:03
We didn't want any captives.
1:43:07
And we called these Conversational Skills for Convening People
1:43:12
and Influencing Decisions.
1:43:14
And we did the first one and had a number of leaders in the university there for the
1:43:20
two-day, full two-day workshop with Paul.
1:43:23
And these people were so impressed and found so much value in it that they
1:43:28
went back and told all their friends and colleagues, so the next time we
1:43:31
offered it, we filled the hundred slots really just [snaps fingers] like that.
1:43:37
That was in... I'm going to say we started that in '96 or '97.
1:43:41
We are still offering conversational skills, and we now are offering - at that
1:43:48
time we were offering it multiple times a year; now we're offering it once a year
1:43:52
under the Provost Fund for Excellence.
1:43:55
When we announce it people sign up.
1:43:58
It usually fills in less than a day, and we've now trained close to 3,000
1:44:02
faculty, staff, and students in this, and they report it has not only
1:44:06
changed - I mean, I regularly get these reports that "this has not only changed
1:44:11
my professional life; it has totally changed my relationship with my family
1:44:15
in positive ways." And so, today Oregon State is different because of that, and...
1:44:25
there are still places on the campus that don't have a clue it ever went on, but
1:44:29
the people who participated still refer to that as a life-changing experience.
1:44:34
So that, I suppose if I were going to pick out one thing, it would
1:44:38
be that, in terms of... feeling like it made a big difference.
1:44:46
But my next question was going to be which has been the most
1:44:48
challenging, and it sounds like that may have also been the same one.
1:44:51
Yeah, I think so [Tasha laughs] because - and it goes back to this point that by
1:44:56
and large we do not know how to make cultural change, and it's scary and,
1:45:04
you know, there's - we can think of all kinds of reasons why we - life
1:45:08
ought to stay the same, and yet the route for us into cultural change
1:45:13
was a positive one because it was like people began to discover what it
1:45:20
means to be listened to, which is one of the main skills that we teach in
1:45:24
conversational skills, is listening.
1:45:27
And what - and we [stumbles] introduce people to the idea that
1:45:32
very seldom in life is there a moment when someone will simply listen.
1:45:38
I mean, it's the gift that you're giving me today, this afternoon, is you're
1:45:43
not interrupting me, you're not, you know, I'm not halfway through a thought
1:45:48
and you ask a question which then redirects where I'm going and so on.
1:45:53
You allow me to speak and reflect and you afford me the opportunity
1:45:57
to have pauses in my thinking.
1:46:00
Well, this workshop introduced that kind of a concept in terms of
1:46:05
the gift of listening, and it has made a significant difference here.
1:46:12
Paul and I have done similar workshops at other places like University of Hawaii.
1:46:17
I remember doing one and the chief business officer took the first day,
1:46:25
then he went as he did every day and picked his wife up for work and asked
1:46:30
her "how was your day," and she began to speak as they drove home, and he
1:46:35
told me it was a 40-minute drive to the other side of the island [Tasha
1:46:38
chuckles] , and that he just listened.
1:46:41
And when they got home, she said, "You have never, ever listened to
1:46:47
me without interrupting before." And then he went on to report that, that
1:46:54
that discovery for the both of them just changed their relationship.
1:46:58
And we have got - we have reports like that from participants all the time.
1:47:03
So, it must feel like you've really made a difference in people's
1:47:06
personal lives, which is powerful.
1:47:07
Yeah, yeah.
1:47:08
Now, I did interrupt you before about the teaching thing; we
1:47:10
were going to get back to that.
1:47:11
So, did you teach again after you taught journalism when you
1:47:14
first came back here in '66?
1:47:16
Well, I taught, I taught forever long that was, several years, in credit courses.
1:47:24
I've since taught mainly at request for - from other faculty members
1:47:31
in guest lectures, helping them do seminars and that kind of
1:47:36
thing, in terms of credit courses.
1:47:39
But I think that really maybe the place where my teaching has
1:47:46
continued has been as, really as a result of the Kellogg project.
1:47:51
And one of the things that I've done and sort of have a reputation for at
1:47:55
the university is being pretty good at the design and management of meetings.
1:48:01
And so, I have taught lots of people, both professional people in the
1:48:06
university and the students, about design and management of meetings.
1:48:12
And so, and that's pretty regular.
1:48:17
I mean, sometimes it's because it's a dysfunctional group that says "we
1:48:21
can't bear to have another one of our awful meetings, will you help us"?
1:48:25
Or it's somebody in a class, a leadership class or something like that, saying
1:48:30
"well, meeting design and management is really important to leadership;
1:48:33
will you come teach this?" So, I think I... you know, it's kind of like
1:48:38
"where do you teach?" well, I feel like I teach on demand and wherever
1:48:45
there's a need and an opportunity.
1:48:47
So, that may be my long-range, long-term
1:48:53
contribution to the institution.
1:48:57
One of the questions that Larry specifically wanted to know is why you
1:49:00
have chosen to stay at OSU for so many years, and I feel like you've kind of
1:49:03
answered that, in that they've given you so many interesting opportunities.
1:49:06
Never gotten bored.
1:49:07
Right.
1:49:08
I mean really, I think that's it, is there's always been one more challenge.
1:49:13
And great people to work with.
1:49:16
And then I think there's all the reasons that make OSU attractive to - when we're
1:49:21
out trying to hire people, you know, faculty and so on, is we can pay them
1:49:26
lower salaries simply because they like to live in the Willamette Valley and all
1:49:32
the wonderful things that surround us.
1:49:35
In your 50-year association with this university, what person or
1:49:39
event do you think has had the most significant impact on the university?
1:49:44
On the university?
1:49:45
Mm-hmm.
1:49:49
... Going
1:49:49
all the way back to your time here as a student.
1:49:51
...Hmm...
1:50:00
Wow... You
1:50:08
know, I don't, I don't think I can identify one thing.
1:50:12
I think what has an impact on a university is, I mean it is what the university
1:50:19
- the university isn't the buildings, it isn't the - it isn't - fundamentally, it
1:50:23
isn't the curriculum; it is the people.
1:50:26
And so, if you look at
1:50:32
OSU... and the people who have been leaders at OSU over the years, each of
1:50:37
those people has left his or her own mark here in a rather unique and wonderful way.
1:50:45
And my privilege has been to be able to work with those people and be
1:50:51
part of whatever mark they've left.
1:50:55
I mean there was one, there was one person for whom I worked whose name I mentioned
1:51:01
earlier, Ernie Briskey, who Dean of this college in the early eighties, and he was
1:51:06
the most awful person I ever worked for in the early years of our relationship.
1:51:12
I mean, I just, I hated to have to deal with Ernie, but he and I got
1:51:18
to a point where we sort of had a rapprochement and came to respect one
1:51:25
another, and I actually was one of the last people to talk to him before
1:51:30
he died in Wisconsin not long ago.
1:51:34
Ernie was one of those people who came in and just kind of if the car-if
1:51:40
the college were a deck of cards, he just took that deck of cards and
1:51:43
threw it up in the air, and everything landed, you know, willy-nilly.
1:51:46
And everybody was very disturbed by Ernie's disrupt.
1:51:55
So, here was a guy who, even to this day, there's a lot of people who will
1:52:00
not give him credit for one thing.
1:52:02
For anything.
1:52:03
But he did make a diff-I mean, we're sitting in a room surrounded by images and
1:52:08
sculpture from the Art About Agriculture Program, and that's one of the things
1:52:13
that he started while he was here
1:52:17
and that is still the first - I mean, it is the first, and
1:52:20
the largest in the nation.
1:52:22
So you know, different people make different contributions, and
1:52:27
I've just had this great luxury of working with so many of them.
1:52:32
What changes have you seen here at OSU in regards to the opportunities and the
1:52:36
difficulties for gay and lesbian students and faculty, you know, anybody who's here?
1:52:49
...Well...
1:52:54
I don't know that it has been dramatically different from what simply - I mean, from
1:53:02
what has gone on in the larger society.
1:53:07
I think OSU, in recent years, has made a real effort to be an
1:53:13
ever-more inclusive society, or ever-more inclusive community...
1:53:24
That said,
1:53:27
this is a - Corvallis is simply a community that isn't very diverse,
1:53:33
and I think it's been hard for Corvallis and OSU to come to grips
1:53:39
with well, what does diversity mean.
1:53:41
And I expect that there were, maybe still are, people who do it in Corvallis or on
1:53:51
campus, who do a double-take - I hope it's not true on campus - but do a double-take
1:53:55
when they see a person of color, or something goes through their head that
1:53:59
this is - this person is different.
1:54:03
I expect the same thing was or is true, was true, at a point when
1:54:08
"geez, I didn't know we had any queers in our community," you know?
1:54:13
And I think we're - we have certainly gotten along farther
1:54:18
down that road of being past that.
1:54:21
I think there are a lot of people on campus who have worked really
1:54:26
hard at being - at providing leadership for being inclusive.
1:54:36
And there are - and that's both men and women.
1:54:41
I think one to whom a lot of credit goes is Larry Roper as the Vice
1:54:47
Provost for Student Services.
1:54:50
Larry gets it in a big way and has provided gentle leadership that
1:54:58
has helped students and faculty and administrators begin to, you know,
1:55:04
really begin and progress beginning about what does it mean to be inclusive.
1:55:12
So, I mean there were times when I was the - among the earliest - of the Gay
1:55:18
and Lesbian Association faculty advisors.
1:55:21
I
1:55:26
used - as soon as I was identified, I began getting
1:55:30
threatening phone calls at home,
1:55:34
either pick up the phone and answer it and get threats or have threats
1:55:40
left on the answering machine.
1:55:45
I got a death threat through campus mail here.
1:55:51
Th-
1:55:52
When was that?
1:55:53
What year was that?
1:55:53
Or do you know when that was generally?
1:55:56
Oh, it probably would have been...
1:56:01
it was probably, I'm going to say, about '75,
1:56:05
'76, somewhere in there.
1:56:07
Okay.
1:56:08
And Bill and I have had garbage dumped on our front porch and, you
1:56:18
know, mailbox knocked down and things like that in those earlier years,
1:56:25
eggs thrown at our house.
1:56:28
I mean, there was just clearly, you know, just this sort of thing.
1:56:31
And
1:56:34
[stumbles] , what it drives home is what... imagine what people
1:56:39
of color have had to put up with for, you know, centuries.
1:56:43
And
1:56:48
I think what it does is it reminds you you're part of a minority and that
1:56:53
there is hate out there and so forth.
1:56:55
But you can't dwell on it.
1:56:57
You sort of just have to go on.
1:56:59
And so anyway, I think that in the bigger picture what's happened is that - and
1:57:05
this is a point that my partner always makes, that Bill always makes - is
1:57:10
the more gay people who are out...
1:57:15
that straight people have to confront and say "oh, well I guess I do know a
1:57:22
gay person and she's my niece," or, you know, "he's my neighbor" or whatever.
1:57:29
And Bill grew up in a church and he got a word there that I didn't have, but he
1:57:35
always said "well, this is witnessing," and that - so, being out as a gay person
1:57:40
is witnessing, and so the more that people who might otherwise be prejudiced have
1:57:47
to confront that there are gay people around them and that they have - and that
1:57:55
they have prejudices about gay people.
1:57:58
The more they have to confront that, the better it is and the more likely that
1:58:05
once they start getting acquainted with gay people, they'll find that we're not
1:58:09
scary and we're pretty much more like them than not like them, and so forth.
1:58:15
So, I've seen that change.
1:58:17
And so, you know, you look around and see that we have a
1:58:24
resource center and we have a person who's actually on payroll for the
1:58:29
university to help provide a positive and supportive environment for young
1:58:33
men and women who are gay, lesbian, I mean LGBTA, all the, and...
1:58:41
So, those are big changes.
1:58:42
I mean, that's a far cry from Helen Moore and patent leather shoes [Tasha
1:58:47
laughs] and that sort of thing.
1:58:47
And the pillow [laughs]
1:58:48
. Uh-huh, exactly.
1:58:52
So, when did you meet Bill?
1:58:54
When and how did you meet him?
1:58:55
Nineteen...seventy-one.
1:59:00
And I used to swim every morning at the YMCA, when Corvallis had
1:59:05
a YMCA, and he was the lifeguard.
1:59:10
And so, I would swim six o'clock swim, and we just got acquainted there, and
1:59:20
I invited him over for dinner and we had dinner and exchanged - we'd go out
1:59:25
for dinner occasionally and so on, and so for - that was for several months,
1:59:29
and then we started living together on our anniversary, the date that we picked
1:59:35
for our anniversary is March 17th, 1972.
1:59:40
So, what does that make it?
1:59:42
March 17th of '09 will be 37 years.
1:59:48
And were you open about your - I mean, you were living together
1:59:50
- were you living together as gay men, or at that time was it-?
1:59:53
Yeah, we came out to our families very shortly very after because we
1:59:57
were getting the business of "well, I don't know why you're not coming
2:00:01
home for Thanksgiving; you don't have any reason to stay there," you know.
2:00:06
Right.
2:00:06
It was like "Well I - excuse me, I do have," so on [Tasha laughs] . And
2:00:11
they had, you know, we went through some, not very many issues, but I
2:00:17
mean there are stories about the coming out to parents and so on.
2:00:20
I don't - they're longer than what you probably want to go into [Tasha laughs]
2:00:24
today, but they handled it, you know.
2:00:26
They came to grips with it.
2:00:28
And families, our - ended up our families both have been very supportive.
2:00:33
So, so you guys have basically been open since the beginning of your relationship.
2:00:38
Yep.
2:00:38
Including on campus with your coworkers and everything?
2:00:41
Yep, yep.
2:00:42
And what does - well, is Bill working now?
2:00:44
What does he do?
2:00:45
He designs - actually, the word is sukiya living, but it - what it means
2:00:51
is he designs Japanese gardens and Japanese interior living spaces.
2:00:58
And the Japanese make no distinction; that those are one, and so he works
2:01:03
with clients to design Japanese gardens and Japanese living spaces.
2:01:09
You guys have obviously had a very long relationship.
2:01:12
What are the keys to the success of that?
2:01:14
Well, I think for us the big then that we have had in common that has worked
2:01:22
every day and to this day is our garden.
2:01:27
And we began that in 1976.
2:01:33
And we live on an almost acre lot right here in Corvallis and on a
2:01:43
hillside, east-facing hillside, and most of that space, except where
2:01:48
the house is, is a Japanese garden.
2:01:51
And it's one that we've been at work on that long, and the Japanese say
2:01:55
that a garden gets beyond being new after 25 years [Tasha laughs] , and
2:02:01
so we're well into that, and it's quite a mature garden, and wonderful.
2:02:07
And of course, it works for Bill to bring the clients there to see examples
2:02:12
of where theirs might go and so forth, but for us, it has been a common
2:02:16
denominator and it's what we do...
2:02:20
whenever we have a chance.
2:02:22
I mean, people say "oh, gee, it must take a lot of work." Well, it
2:02:24
takes a lot of work but it's - it is because that's where we want to be.
2:02:29
And so, it has a lot of spiritual dimensions to it, and I mean spiritual
2:02:35
in the sense of being about something together is a very positive and spiritual
2:02:41
sort of experience, and we complement one another in terms of what we do.
2:02:48
How do you think your experience living in this country over your lifetime has
2:02:51
been different because you are a gay man?
2:02:54
Your place in the world?
2:02:55
I think - I have occasion...
2:03:00
Yesterday in a, in a
2:03:05
conversation that Cary Green, our head advisor and assistant dean, and Larry
2:03:09
Roper were leading over in the Leadership Center, and we were talking about...
2:03:18
what builds community and what you do that students recognize and value in terms of
2:03:26
just how you behave as a community member.
2:03:30
And
2:03:33
it really, in my estimation,
2:03:38
what makes relationships worked is if they're based in authenticity.
2:03:44
And if... if you, at some point in your life, are confronted with saying to the
2:03:54
world "I am this," whatever this is, "I am this," and it's something that is
2:04:05
the subject of revulsion to people or that they don't understand it or they're
2:04:13
afraid of it or whatever and you're still saying that, if you say that, it's kind
2:04:19
of like well, what is there worse that I can tell you about myself, you know?
2:04:26
And so, it forces you into approaching the world with a kind of authenticity.
2:04:29
It's kind of like okay, what you see is what you get.
2:04:32
And I'm not something else, this is what I am.
2:04:35
This is who I am, take it or leave it.
2:04:39
But...
2:04:42
so, it - you leave any pretense at the door, I think, and
2:04:47
then you just are who you are.
2:04:50
That's what I think
2:04:53
has been a very empowering - that's been the gift of being gay, for
2:04:58
me, is that I don't pretend to be anything other than what I am or who
2:05:02
I am, and if people like me, that's because they like me for who I am.
2:05:10
And I think it's worked to have - to build us some marvelous relationships.
2:05:15
That make sense?
2:05:16
Yeah, it's perfect!
2:05:17
That's a - that answers the question exactly.
