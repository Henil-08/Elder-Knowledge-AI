00:03
Okay, good evening this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State
00:06
University, College of Forestry.
00:08
I’m here,
00:11
we’re on the edge of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, correct?
00:15
We’re on the very edge.
00:15
We’re on the very edge.
00:17
We’re in the North Toutle River Valley on the edge of what
00:21
they call the debris avalanche.
00:24
What I’ve learned is we call this the debris avalanche deposit.
00:27
Deposit, okay.
00:28
So, the avalanche is the process.
00:30
This is the deposit.
00:31
I’m here with Dr. Virginia Dale with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
00:36
Correct.
00:37
And how would you like to characterize your discipline
00:40
or what you do, for the record?
00:42
I’m a landscape ecologist.
00:46
My background is in mathematics.
00:50
My position at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is as a Corporate Fellow,
00:54
which is the top tier for scientists.
00:58
About 1% of the scientists rise to that level.
01:00
I’ve been able to work at St. Helens since 1980.
01:05
Very good.
01:06
This interview’s going to focus on Mount St. Helens.
01:09
Virginia has been coming here since the very first, really month
01:14
after the big blast of May 1980.
01:17
She has been continuing to do work here, including at the 35th Anniversary
01:22
Science Pulse that’s taking place in and around the volcano this week.
01:28
We’re going to talk about her experience with Mount St. Helens.
01:34
What did you know about volcanoes, volcanic processes before this happened?
01:41
I did my Ph.D. thesis on Mount Rainier, focusing on a subalpine meadow.
01:46
The study was pollination ecology, but I clearly knew it was a volcano
01:52
that had glaciers on it and had visited Kautz Creek mudflow, which
01:57
is a mudflow that had come down from
02:02
Mount Rainier.
02:03
There had been a long-term succession study there that I was helping
02:06
Peter Frenzen with follow up in terms of successional dynamics.
02:11
This is before Peter became involved with Mount St. Helens, he
02:15
was working up at Mount Rainier?
02:16
Right.
02:17
Right.
02:18
I was advising that process because I had visited Kautz Creek many times
02:23
with class projects and was aware that it was a very small mudflow event.
02:28
I knew the—SEATAC
02:32
Airport was on a large mudflow from Mount Rainier, which is pretty phenomenal
02:37
in that they didn’t realize that until the airport was being built.
02:41
Is that the Nisqually River?
02:41
No, it is not the Nisqually River.
02:44
I’ve hiked around many of the volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest.
02:46
As an ecologist, I was aware of successional studies and how they work.
02:54
What was your impressions, let’s say, going back as a child when you first
02:57
started reading or seeing art or seeing movies about volcanoes and how
03:02
volcanoes were supposed to act according to some cultural representation?
03:08
Gosh, I don’t even know if I thought about volcanoes too much at that time.
03:12
But, you know, volcanoes are snow-cap mountains that sit
03:16
there and don’t do very much.
03:17
I had certainly heard of Pelee and I had subsequently visited [SS interrupts]
03:23
. Martinique?
03:24
I didn’t mean to say Pelée, the [SS interrupts]
03:26
. Because Pelée is in Martinique, right?
03:26
Right, Pelée’s in Martinique, but the volcano Vesuvius.
03:30
Vesuvius is what I’m thinking of.
03:32
I certainly was aware of Vesuvius and the implications from that.
03:37
Of course, that’s kind of the iconic volcano in world
03:40
history, wouldn’t you say?
03:41
Exactly.
03:43
So, I knew they could be destructive, but I knew they were beautiful too.
03:47
I didn’t think of them as so active as I do now.
03:51
Did you ever have an image like runny lava like Hawaii volcanoes?
03:56
Oh, certainly, yeah.
03:57
I mean you know what I’m talking about?
03:58
Sure.
03:58
The stereotypical version that people think of as, like, there’s
04:02
never really been any typical lava like that here to speak of.
04:06
Absolutely.
04:06
There hasn’t been anything like that.
04:08
Yeah, that’s true.
04:09
Hawaii represents a lot of people’s concepts of what volcanoes are like.
04:14
But you had a different idea just by the mere fact that you had studied
04:18
in the Northwest and you at least understood something about the large
04:21
strata of volcanoes [stratovolcanoes] and how different they were.
04:23
Right.
04:25
Because I had been to Hawaii and I had certainly spent a lot
04:28
of time on Baker and Rainier.
04:29
Now, where did you grow up?
04:31
I grew up in Tennessee.
04:32
Okay, so right where you work, okay.
04:34
Nearby.
04:36
There’s been no active volcanism in the eastern United States for,
04:40
how many hundred million years?
04:42
I don’t know.
04:43
For a long time.
04:43
A long time, right.
04:47
Now, let’s get right into it.
04:50
How did you hear about Mount St. Helens?
04:53
Did you hear about the initial eruption and were you out
04:56
there when that was started?
05:01
The botany building where I worked [SS interrupts]
05:04
. Is this University of Washington?
05:05
At the University of Washington where I was working on my Ph.D.
05:07
thesis was in the same building as the geophysics department.
05:12
The bottom floor was where the geophysics and all their records were.
05:17
They had a seismometer right there that you could look at.
05:20
The day I gave my Ph.D. thesis defense was the day that the quakes started happening.
05:28
Which was March 19, I believe right?
05:30
Yeah.
05:30
Was the day.
05:31
I can’t remember if it was the 18th or 21.
05:32
I have to look back.
05:34
It was right in there.
05:34
Anyway, I can’t remember, yeah, it was late March, mid-March.
05:40
The day I gave my defense was the day the mountain started quaking.
05:44
That’s pretty profound confluence
05:49
of events.
05:49
When that started happening and I had friends who were
05:56
geophysicists.
05:56
The group of people I knew got really excited about Mount St. Helens.
06:00
We started coming down here every weekend to be part of the
06:04
group that were volcano watchers.
06:06
We would go to nearby areas where you could see the mountain steam and then
06:11
we started coming out to the Toutle River and trying to document the
06:15
vegetation that was here and think about how we might put out permanent plots.
06:19
So, you were actually doing this before the eruption?
06:21
Before the eruption?
06:22
Yeah.
06:23
That’s interesting.
06:24
So, before the eruption and I remember I got to go with a field
06:28
trip with a group of seismologists because the red zone was set up.
06:33
We went to the mountain and stood right there at Timberline below the bulge.
06:39
This was two weeks before the eruption.
06:41
The seismologists were all, first off, they were all laying around so
06:45
they could feel earthquakes, because all these earthquakes were going on.
06:48
They were saying, “Well, I wonder what’s going to happen.” Somebody said, “I
06:52
think it’s going to erupt.” Nobody of that group ever thought about it being
06:56
this northward directed blast at all.
06:59
And nothing on this scale.
07:00
Nothing on this scale.
07:02
We were thinking an eruption would be smoke going up.
07:06
A Plinian eruption, a typical upward steam.
07:09
Yes, and didn’t think about mudflows, didn’t think about debris avalanches.
07:13
Didn’t think about pyroclastic flows.
07:14
I didn’t know those words, but we knew that there would be an
07:18
opportunity for succession studies.
07:20
We were trying to configure ourselves to be in a place and did a whole
07:24
lot of literature review, actually, before the mountain erupted.
07:28
When I talked to Fred Swanson later, he was really happy that we had this
07:32
literature review we put together of how plants started recovering from succession.
07:38
One of them that is really good was on Hawaiian volcanoes, which, as you
07:42
pointed out, are so different from here.
07:45
In a sense, before the eruption I had the proposal written and
07:50
was waiting for this to happen.
07:53
After it erupted, then I shared this information with the group at Oregon
07:59
State University and at the University of Washington, and that’s how I got
08:04
involved with this team, because I had done some homework initially and most of
08:08
them had been off on their other things.
08:10
I was kind of a free agent.
08:12
Because I had finished my degree and I had a new baby, I thought I would be able
08:19
to have a break and spend some time at home with my baby and [SS interrupts]
08:23
. Surprise!
08:23
Yes, it just didn’t happen at
08:25
all.
08:26
But it was great having done the work that we did.
08:28
We’d also driven on a lot of the logging roads, because we were
08:33
able to get permits to come in.
08:35
It was a red zone, but we could get permits to come in for the day, and,
08:39
so, I knew some of the logging roads already on the south side of the Toutle
08:44
and on the west side of the mountain.
08:46
In addition to the plots that you laid out and some general survey
08:50
stuff, did you also take some photography which would give you
08:53
a baseline for future photography?
08:55
No, I mean we didn’t really monitor the vegetation.
08:59
We were just thinking how we should do this.
09:00
We should have collected soils.
09:02
We should have really monitored the plants, but we had no idea there
09:05
would be an impact down this low.
09:07
We were trying to get up toward Timberline.
09:10
It didn’t last.
09:10
It was only about 2 months before it blew.
09:13
Yeah.
09:13
Less than 2 months.
09:13
Yeah, because May 18th it was just a couple of months.
09:18
In retrospect, we could have done a whole lot more, but we didn’t.
09:21
Now, did you meet David Johnston?
09:24
I don’t know that I ever met him.
09:26
I was trying to think about it.
09:27
Because he was at Washington, wasn’t he?
09:29
Or briefly?
09:29
No, I thought he was with USGS.
09:31
No, but he did something where he went up and interacted with UW people?
09:36
Oh, I’m sure he interacted a lot with them.
09:40
I interacted with a couple of geologists, quite a lot.
09:46
I don’t know that I ever met him.
09:49
What was your sense of the predictions about what was going
09:51
to happen from the geologic experts and the people that you knew?
09:55
It was going to be really exciting and I wanted to be there.
09:59
Keith Ronnholm, who was one of the people that survived and had some fabulous
10:04
pictures, was a neighbor of mine.
10:08
We were going down every weekend and he heard about it, so he thought he’d go down
10:12
and then he ended up with these fabulous pictures he sold to National Geographic.
10:16
As soon as he came back and survived, he took his pictures to one of
10:20
these 1-hour photos and invited us down to look at them on his living
10:24
room wall and we all just died.
10:27
It was amazing the pictures he had.
10:29
Were these the famous ones of the kind of the side of the landslide
10:33
and the blast, those ones, right?
10:35
Right.
10:35
There were two sets.
10:35
There were Gary Rosenquist’s and Keith Ronnholm’s.
10:38
They both were at the same spot, and they captured different parts of it.
10:42
Those two sets.
10:45
Immediately we were engaged with that, with
10:50
what had actually started to happen.
10:52
In terms of your conceptualizing
10:55
what you thought might need to be done in an eruptive landscape and
11:00
you did this literature review.
11:02
What was your sense about what had been done and what had not been done
11:05
in volcanically disturbed landscapes?
11:10
One thing is these permanent plots - being able to follow things over time.
11:14
I knew from my study at Kautz Creek that I helped Peter with, that those
11:18
plots had been set up and we were able to go back and visit the same plots
11:22
and see the changes that had happened subsequent to the mudflow and the
11:28
vegetation recovery that occurred.
11:30
Having information before and during the recovery we knew was going to be critical.
11:36
That was one thing that was important.
11:38
What was your question again?
11:43
From the work that you did on literature review in preparing for whatever what
11:48
was your sense of what had been done and what had not been done going into
11:53
and then all of a sudden it happened and your thinking about these things
11:56
and you obviously had some concepts floating around in your head about
11:59
what you thought would be good to do.
12:02
One of the things, a guy named Griggs.
12:05
I think his name was Robert Griggs, did a very nice series of
12:10
studies at Mount Katmai in Alaska.
12:13
They were published in National Geographic.
12:15
This was in the early 1900s when that magazine was more scientific.
12:19
The Valley of the 10,000 Smokes of Katmai.
12:21
Right.
12:22
Right.
12:22
He had 3 lengthy papers that were really exciting and really good, and he
12:28
documented how burial affected vegetation and the depth of burial had an effect.
12:35
I thought that was interesting that he did that, but I thought the debris avalanche
12:40
offered something entirely different.
12:42
The average depth is 45 m. It was way over anything that he had seen at Katmai.
12:48
I mean, Katmai was probably 3 to 5 to 10 maybe?
12:51
Yeah.
12:52
I don’t think it was near that deep, so he was talking about
12:55
less than a meter [SS interrupts]
12:56
. Oh, so it was really small.
12:57
It was very small in the places that he was working.
13:01
Looking at the book by Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg, in Hawaii they were
13:07
classifying vegetation recovery in terms of different types of lava flows.
13:13
Again, it’s really different than what happened here.
13:17
It’s also a tropical zone, as well.
13:19
It’s a tropical zone.
13:20
It’s just really different.
13:23
But the importance of getting out there early was really critical.
13:27
That was apparent that it was important to get out there early, to
13:31
get out there as often as you could.
13:34
For me, as a fresh Ph.D., to not be reliant on others to helicopter you and
13:41
things like that, but to see what was available and to run experiments as well.
13:48
You were obviously at Rainier and there’s the big three of Southern Washington:
13:53
Adams, Rainier, and St. Helens.
13:55
What do you remember thinking about St. Helens even before the eruption started?
13:59
That cute little cone to the south, or?
14:01
Yeah, well, it always looks so much younger than Rainier and Adams.
14:06
I don’t have any experience with Adams, really, so I can’t speak to that,
14:09
but I have a ton of experience with Rainier and I knew that the subalpine
14:16
in the Pacific Northwest is more expansive than at any other place.
14:21
I have looked and seen that these volcanoes have some endemics on them,
14:27
which is kind of interesting to see what is here.
14:32
We found a paper by Harold St. John.
14:34
You know about this paper?
14:37
It’s a classic paper.
14:38
I can’t remember the exact details.
14:40
He had been on a field trip to Mount St. Helens and
14:46
20 years later he published his notes from that field trip,
14:50
and he published it in 1979.
14:53
The notes were basically a species list.
14:56
How nice for you.
14:58
Yeah, so it’s the only really good species list that we have.
15:02
Didn’t Jerry Franklin do some work around here in the ‘60s, too?
15:05
Yeah, but his work was on soils and his was in the forest systems.
15:10
Jerry did some great work, but it was different than knowing what is there.
15:16
We knew something about what the forests were like, but getting a species list
15:20
of what was here was really important because that’s what I’m looking at right
15:25
now - how these species change over time.
15:28
We’re getting some of the species, of course, that were on his list.
15:30
In fact, we’re finding that everything’s coming back that was here before
15:34
and that happened very early on.
15:35
But, in terms of scientists doing their work and taking years to publish
15:40
it, this was a great example that you need to go through your records.
15:44
We found some real gems like those kinds of papers that I mentioned.
15:48
We found that St. Helens was very unusual in terms of volcanology in some ways, in
15:55
that it was this northward-directed blast, but Pelée, that we mentioned earlier,
15:59
was more characteristic of some things.
16:04
It wasn’t like a Vesuvius.
16:05
It wasn’t like many of the other volcanoes.
16:07
Well, Pelée, what killed all the people in Saint-Pierre was
16:11
just a serious pyroclastic flow.
16:13
Right.
16:14
That’s more like Vesuvius.
16:16
Correct.
16:20
We quickly started learning how the different disturbances
16:23
were what was important here, and it wasn’t just one thing.
16:26
It was many different things.
16:28
Getting to know the geologists and working with them closely was
16:31
really fun and important to do.
16:35
Where were you when it blew?
16:37
It was at home in Seattle.
16:39
What do you remember?
16:41
I remember somebody must have called us or somebody must have told us.
16:45
They said it finally blew and was really excited.
16:47
Then getting to talk to Keith Ronnholm that afternoon with his
16:50
eyewitness accounts was fabulous.
16:53
You got one of the great eyewitness account firsthand right away.
16:57
Right away, yeah.
16:59
That must have really been exciting.
17:01
It was really cool.
17:02
Then, as I said, shortly thereafter I got to go in with a team that Jerry
17:08
had, but over the summer a lot of
17:12
people wanted to fly in and see it and they would take scientists
17:17
so they could get in closer.
17:18
I didn’t go in the crater very often but did get to see the area.
17:22
But being with the first group of biologists later on was cool.
17:27
Immediately, I knew this was going to change my research career that day.
17:34
I mean, it was pretty clear.
17:35
When did you go in the first time and who were you with?
17:39
The first time I went in a helicopter was with Jerry and that team.
17:44
Maybe Jerry will remember who was on the helicopter, but I can’t remember.
17:47
I think it was probably Fred Swanson and Jim Sedell and Jerry from OSU [actually
17:51
from the Pacific Northwest Research Station, US Forest Service] . It was Roger
17:52
Del Moral and Larry Bliss and me from UW.
17:55
That might have been it.
17:56
I don’t know how many seats are on a Forest Service helicopter.
17:59
You’re flying over the hill.
18:01
Tell me about what went through your head when you saw what you saw.
18:06
I don’t know if this was that trip.
18:08
But the most impressive way I ever saw it was when we went in one
18:12
time and it was really cloudy.
18:13
It might have been that trip.
18:15
Because you go in the Toutle Valley and it was really cloudy, so you’d
18:19
pop up into the clouds and then you’d go into another valley.
18:23
Here, you’d see all this mudflow and then you’d pop into another valley
18:27
and you’d see all this blowdown.
18:29
Then you’d go up and pop into another valley and it would be the mudflow.
18:35
Instead of just coming in and seeing it from the top you’d see all these
18:38
different kinds [SS interrupts]
18:39
. You saw elements of it.
18:40
Yeah.
18:41
That was really neat.
18:42
That was really exciting.
18:44
I’m sure before I went in on the
18:49
helicopter that we drove down and went in as far as we could.
18:53
The red zone [the zone of restricted access] was still set up and we probably
18:57
went in on the South Fork of the Toutle, because that was more accessible
19:01
than going in on the North Fork.
19:03
But
19:05
this road is obviously new [referring to the road near where we were sitting]
19:08
, but the road that it connects to was an old Forest Service road, so we could
19:11
get down that road, and that’s one of the reasons our plots are nearby here.
19:14
So, actually this road did not get destroyed by?
19:17
Oh, this road is a brand-new road.
19:19
Okay, you’re talking about the ones up high?
19:21
The one that came down.
19:24
It isn’t really accessible now.
19:26
The debris avalanche was impacted on the side, so if you got a permit to come
19:30
in and the way the permits after the eruption were, and before to some extent,
19:35
you had to go to Vancouver that day, get the permit that day, come in, check in
19:41
on your radio every hour [SS interrupts]
19:43
. Because the thing was still smoking away.
19:44
And be out that night.
19:48
We got a nice support from the Washington State Department of National
19:51
Resources [DNR], who had people at work would could listen to our radios.
19:56
But the radios didn’t always work here, so we’d have to walk, go up high.
20:02
It was physically hard to do it, but we did a lot of it.
20:06
So, you started setting up plots or conceptualizing how to do
20:10
things how many days after the big blast, or weeks approximately?
20:14
Well, two weeks after when we went with Jerry, we had spent a lot of time on
20:19
the phone talking about how to set up a study for long-term succession and
20:26
everyone agreed that we’d have these 250 m2 circular plots that were 50 m apart,
20:31
and that was pretty much what we did.
20:33
That happened within weeks, that there would be these different things.
20:37
Now, the Forest Service didn’t actually set up their plots until 1981 and 1982.
20:43
I set up my plots earlier than that.
20:46
These are not Forest Service plots, per se.
20:49
Of the 103 that are listed in your literature, that’s when
20:54
that process started, right?
20:55
Right.
20:56
Did they all go in that first year?
20:57
They went in in 1981, I’m pretty sure.
21:00
Okay, so the first year was figuring it out.
21:03
And in the first year we wandered all overlooking for
21:08
any survivors we could find.
21:09
So, you were looking for people?
21:11
No, for plants.
21:12
Plants, I mean.
21:12
Excuse me.
21:12
Plant survivors, yeah.
21:15
In fact, there was someone killed right up there.
21:18
There’s a cross right up there that I’ve run across.
21:22
Kind of sobering, huh?
21:23
Yeah!!
21:24
But we were looking for plant survivors.
21:28
What we found were everything that survived was from a piece of a stem
21:34
or a root or some part of a plant that happened to be near the surface.
21:37
They were much more common along the margins than in the middle
21:40
of the debris avalanche deposit.
21:40
Because the middle was just the weight, it was just so intense.
21:43
It was the tumble down of the mountain, you know, the
21:46
tumbling down of the mountain.
21:48
It’s really rough still when you go out there in the middle.
21:51
So, the first year we were wandering around trying to figure out where to
21:55
study and we did a lot of soil samples.
21:58
I collected soils and did analysis and did these experiments to grow the plants
22:04
in this material to see how well they would grow to try and figure out if
22:09
it would have enough nutrients and the particle size was right to grow plants.
22:14
But, when we put in our permanent plots, it organized what we would be doing.
22:20
What was the biggest challenge the first week, two weeks, the first summer?
22:25
Logistics.
22:26
Getting in.
22:26
Getting in was really a challenge, because we had to have these radios.
22:30
We had to check in.
22:31
You had to get a permit every day.
22:32
And you had to bring in by helicopter.
22:34
No, we could drive in.
22:35
Oh, you could drive in?
22:36
Okay.
22:36
That’s what I’m saying.
22:37
And I had a baby.
22:39
So, I had a babysitter down in Toutle.
22:41
I would drive down
22:45
to Vancouver, get the permit, leave my child at the babysitter,
22:48
come in and then come back out.
22:50
Momma’s going to visit the volcano, right?
22:53
That’s right.
22:54
We didn’t have to rely on helicopters, which made it really great.
22:57
We could spend a lot of time getting out here.
23:01
That was really great.
23:02
But the news helicopters did take us out to our site sometimes,
23:06
and that made it a lot easier.
23:08
We’re kind of in the lower portion.
23:11
Kind of draw a quick word picture of let’s say from the bottom going
23:15
up what you saw, what was there?
23:19
The physiography?
23:19
This debris avalanche extends 25 km, I think is
23:24
the distance, from the mountain itself.
23:26
It’s a tumble-down mountain.
23:28
The further it gets away the more organized it is.
23:34
At the toe of the debris avalanche was this mass of vegetation that
23:38
came down with it, and that’s where you saw logs and things.
23:41
And sometimes they were along the sides.
23:43
Most of the material was this gray,
23:50
mixed up mess.
23:51
Some rocks are there.
23:54
It’s about 63% sand.
23:56
It’s highly sandy.
23:58
It’s beautiful except it wasn’t like Washington.
24:02
It was more like an Arizona desert or something and this gray color.
24:05
Then you have all these really steep hummocks that were hard
24:09
to walk over and just like a moonscape, very, very different.
24:14
It was gorgeous in some ways, but not what you would expect of Washington.
24:22
Then there were other parts of the debris avalanche that were different,
24:25
because there was this process during the afternoon of May 18th and during the whole
24:30
day there were earthquakes occurring and so that would shake the water to the top
24:35
through a process called liquefaction.
24:38
Like, if you get sand in a bucket and shake it the water comes to the top
24:42
and then the water would gather up.
24:44
Jon Major talks about bathtubs filling and spilling, and then would rush down.
24:50
Then you had that mudflow
24:53
that occurred all afternoon starting about noon and going to midnight initiated the
24:59
debris avalanche and going downstream.
25:01
The places where that mudflow passed are smoother than others and, in
25:05
some places, that’s where the erosion initially occurred very quickly, so
25:11
that’s where we would find some plants.
25:13
There was one place we called “the lupine flats” because it had four lupines on
25:18
it, and we didn’t see them anywhere else.
25:19
The lupine flats.
25:21
Four lupines.
25:22
Well, it’s got to be named somehow, right?
25:23
Yeah.
25:25
We thought that was going to be really cool and there was going to
25:27
be all this vegetation setting up.
25:29
We set up some of our plots on the lupine flats, but those were some that
25:34
washed out because it was right in an area where a stream ended up forming.
25:38
There was no organized water.
25:40
The Toutle River didn’t exist at that time.
25:43
The Spirit Lake was totally gone, dammed up.
25:46
Yeah.
25:47
Over the ensuing years the river found itself, and now
25:53
you have this massive erosion.
25:55
But at that time, it was this gray moonscape with very few plants.
26:01
I remember one time I found this little vole out there in ’82, and he was so
26:06
stressed I caught him with my hands.
26:10
There was one plant within sight, and he ran under that plant.
26:14
I don’t know how he got out there.
26:16
But there were no organisms, hardly.
26:18
We did see some ducks early on, which was crazy because
26:24
there’s nothing there, but people have told me since then that birds
26:28
have a strong homing system, and they will come back even though
26:33
the landscape looks very different, and these ducks were just there.
26:36
It was kind of crazy, but it was all very different.
26:41
Yes, absolutely.
26:43
Were any of the either
26:49
search and rescue or any of the helicopters from the Forest Service or
26:52
the USGS or the news reporters, were you able to get any really good footage
26:57
from that of the debris flow in action that, obviously, there was a lahar, all
27:02
these combination of things: was there any fresh footage that would be useable
27:06
scientifically from that first day?
27:09
I didn’t even ask, because I was more concerned with what it was
27:14
like after it was established.
27:16
The geologists were extremely interested in getting that footage for understanding
27:20
the process, and we’re glad they did.
27:22
That helped us understand what was left in place.
27:25
But we saw our job as, “Okay, this is what is here now.” And understanding
27:30
how it got there helped us understand its constituents and where it would go,
27:34
but we didn’t even go that direction.
27:38
What is useful now is the remote sensing imagery and getting the
27:43
changes over time since the eruption.
27:45
How does remote sensing help the particular on the ground fieldwork?
27:50
It helps give us an idea of how this system of permanent plots
27:59
is representative of the larger area.
28:03
Now, what were some of your essential assumptions regarding ecological
28:09
theory going into this and even major disturbances before this thing happened
28:16
and how did what you saw and studied support, challenge, or overturn that?
28:24
Well, the general successional paradigm is that only the light, wind-disbursed
28:31
seeds come in early that those have to get established and grow up and produce
28:39
shade and improve the nutrient conditions.
28:42
Then you get what are called late successional species that tend to have
28:46
heavy seeds that require the nutrients.
28:49
And that it’s this orderly process that you can look at and say this is where you
28:55
are in the sere, the word that’s used to describe the stages of succession and that
29:03
one process moves orderly into the next.
29:08
Early on you should only see one set of species; then they will die out;
29:13
then you’ll get another set of species, and they will become established,
29:16
and then you might get another one.
29:18
Then they’ll die out or they’ll become a dominant species and they’ll be able
29:21
to regenerate themselves, correct?
29:22
Right and so this concept of climax was very important, that you move
29:27
in succession toward a final state and that state will be static.
29:33
So, a well-organized, linear process with a well-defined end.
29:40
How long did it take you to realize that was problematic here?
29:44
Well, it really became clear as we started looking at the seeds that
29:49
came in and looking at the seedlings that were becoming established.
29:53
For one thing, we had this system of trapping seeds that we maintained over
30:00
several years, and the paradigm would say that you would find more seeds on the
30:04
edge of the debris avalanche, because [as you can see here] there are places nearby
30:09
that were not disturbed and you would expect the seeds to come from those areas.
30:16
What we found was that the greatest number of seeds were right out in the
30:18
middle of the debris avalanche deposit.
30:20
Because they were blowing in?
30:21
Yeah, we think they were blowing in from downstream, even though
30:24
it was many kilometers, but that was what was happening.
30:28
We think what was happening was, although you find more seeds close to
30:34
the parent plant and it follows a normal distribution, that this situation was
30:38
out on the tails of that distribution, because it was such a big event.
30:43
What happens in the tails doesn’t follow any kind of prediction.
30:48
We also started realizing that chance events were really important.
30:57
For example, early on Epilobium angustifolium [fireweed – the genus is
30:58
now Chamaenerion] was really important, and we found a huge population of
31:01
it out in the middle of the debris avalanche without anything nearby.
31:06
Later we found three horned caterpillars.
31:11
Those three horned caterpillars ate every single plant.
31:15
They were hungry.
31:16
Yeah.
31:17
There was nothing else out there.
31:19
That little population of fireweed that we thought was
31:21
going to be really important for
31:25
providing a place where plants would be trapped just didn’t happen.
31:30
It just shows you that nature doesn’t care about models necessarily.
31:35
It may follow models, but it doesn’t necessarily follow models.
31:40
Right.
31:40
Then we started seeing the seeds coming in of early successional
31:44
and late successional species.
31:46
Not only that, the late successional species, particularly the trees, survived.
31:52
Now, over time, we’re starting to get a community coming in,
31:55
and we’re starting to get more of the late successional understory.
32:00
Another big surprise is how well the alder are doing.
32:03
We’re sitting here under the alder, but people think of alder as a wet-site
32:07
species and you shouldn’t have them in this really dry, sandy material.
32:13
I remember I gave a talk; it was either at the ’81 or ’82
32:17
anniversary of the eruption, and they asked me be controversial.
32:20
So, I said, I think alder’s going to be the big story here, and people got upset.
32:26
They said no way, you know?
32:28
It’s not wet.
32:28
You’ve got this sand-sized material.
32:33
It’s just not going to grow.
32:34
But you look here and what you see are alder.
32:36
How long did it take for you to be proven right in terms of
32:38
the eyes of your colleagues?
32:40
Maybe about 5 or 10 years.
32:42
I mean we started getting the data, but the evidence is the
32:46
alder were coming in fast.
32:48
We would start seeing them.
32:50
They grow very well.
32:53
We did germination tests with the debris avalanche material and found alder
32:56
had 23% germination, which is pretty high on this rather inert material.
33:01
They could grow in it.
33:02
They’re one of the fastest growing trees in the world.
33:04
They can produce seeds in 3 years.
33:06
Because this soil is quite acidic and there’s not a lot
33:09
of organic material, correct?
33:10
Yeah, exactly.
33:11
And it’s sand sized.
33:13
And the carbon to nitrogen ratio, what was it back then?
33:15
It’s pretty, I mean I can’t remember the numbers, but.
33:17
I mean just generalize.
33:18
It’s very low.
33:19
It’s very low.
33:20
Right.
33:20
It’s very low.
33:22
In fact, we did this pot test where you grow lettuce as a bioassay in the pots.
33:31
We did it for mudflow material and with the debris avalanche material.
33:37
You have the soil, and you add one nutrient at a time and
33:40
then all of them together plus macronutrients and micronutrients.
33:44
We found that in the mudflow every time you would add something that the
33:50
lettuce would grow a little bit better.
33:52
In the debris avalanche, they never really grew.
33:55
They survived, but they were these teeny little lettuce plants.
33:59
They didn’t grow.
33:59
They didn’t put on biomass.
34:00
They survived, which was something.
34:03
But there were clearly problems with this material and being able to do very well.
34:09
But alder did.
34:12
Although that was controversial, it was interesting.
34:15
I talked to Richard Walker, an alder specialist, and he agreed
34:19
that alder was likely to make it.
34:21
Interesting.
34:25
That’s been kind of surprising.
34:26
Now the alder are starting to die.
34:28
It was kind of fun when we were out there today to see all these alder fallen over.
34:32
Because they’re what 30, 35 years old, some of them yeah?
34:34
Some of them are that old, yeah.
34:36
Alders can live 60 years or so, but it’s a stressful environment.
34:40
Yeah.
34:41
Now, who did you collaborate with in this research on the debris
34:45
avalanche the first few years?
34:47
Who were your colleagues that were doing the work?
34:49
A.B. Adams was my husband at the time, and he and I were the main
34:55
people who were working on this.
34:57
We were part of the proposal led by Larry Bliss and Jerry
35:03
Franklin and probably Jim Sedell.
35:07
Was Fred involved with that, too?
35:08
And Fred.
35:09
And Roger Del Moral.
35:11
There was one big NSF proposal that went in, and it got funded very quickly.
35:16
A lot of the core people that are still here were right there
35:19
with you at the beginning.
35:20
Right.
35:20
We divided up the areas, and they agreed that I could focus my
35:23
research on the debris avalanche.
35:27
Kind of give me an idea of themes and areas, just rough sketch
35:31
between some of those figures.
35:32
Okay, so Roger wanted the south side of the mountain, and Jerry and
35:40
Fred worked in the blowdown area.
35:43
We were working on the mudflow some, but it was spread too thin.
35:49
We didn’t follow up on that as much.
35:53
Larry Bliss never really followed up a whole lot.
35:56
He was more of a kind of an administrator.
35:58
Of course, Jim Sedell was interested in the stream systems,
36:01
mainly on the other side.
36:03
Everybody else was on the other side.
36:05
We were here, which was fine with me because this is where it was accessible.
36:09
It was really hard to get in in the side over there.
36:12
Because of the amount of blowdown, the roads, everything.
36:15
Right.
36:15
Here, you had access through this logging system that
36:22
brought you right down to the debris avalanche.
36:24
Now, these logging roads were really hard to figure out, but Weyerhaeuser
36:28
provided us with maps and keys and let us get into places and then
36:32
you could walk out onto the debris avalanche deposit from the side of the
36:35
valley, where disturbance was minimal.
36:35
Now, there was some blast effect up on the high ridges, correct?
36:38
Absolutely.
36:39
Well, maybe you couldn’t see.
36:40
As we were walking out today, we could see that.
36:45
Around to the south side of the Toutle River you can see some blast,
36:51
and there certainly was toward the other way, toward the north.
36:55
But this area where we are sitting was all buried under the debris avalanche, so
37:01
there was nothing for the blast to affect.
37:04
It was all gone.
37:04
Now, 1981
37:07
did they have something that you might consider the first Pulse?
37:11
I think it was in 1981, yeah?
37:14
Was that organized by Jerry Franklin?
37:16
Yeah, I think it was.
37:18
What do you remember about that first Pulse?
37:20
Well, did I tell you on tape about the
37:28
stepping into the quicksand?
37:29
Have I mentioned that?
37:30
You said when we were sitting over there.
37:32
Not on tape, so no.
37:35
I remember when we first landed on the debris avalanche, because
37:39
that’s where I really wanted to go.
37:41
I remember the helicopter pilot was really careful about setting the helicopter
37:48
down because we didn’t know what this was going to be like, if it was going to be
37:52
quicksand, what it was going to be like.
37:55
He was very, very careful.
37:57
When we got out, it was this really, hard, hard, hard, hard material.
38:01
One of the places I walked from the helicopter there was this mound, quite
38:08
a big mound, and as I stepped on it, it kind of sunk down several feet, and we
38:15
think what happened there was that it was a big chunk of ice, and, because it
38:21
hadn’t rained since the eruption, the ice had melted and it had a little material
38:26
on top and it just had been enough to
38:31
support itself structurally.
38:33
It never had any weight on it.
38:35
To me, that was an indication of how very, very fresh this material was.
38:39
No one had walked on it.
38:42
There was nothing there.
38:43
It was just gray and all this up and down and rough material.
38:47
Little of it was smooth.
38:51
It was not even like a moonscape, because when you think about that it was rounded.
38:55
It was this just very rough, and people now refer to this as the hummocks
39:00
area and are realizing other volcanoes have a lot of these hummocks, but I’d
39:04
never seen anything like it at all.
39:06
It was crazy.
39:07
Would you classify it as chunky?
39:10
Partly chunky, but it had all these sharp, sharp peaks of
39:18
material that had fallen down.
39:19
The best way to describe it is as the mountain tumbling down on itself.
39:23
Just a huge amount of material.
39:27
I think of chunks as blocks and some of these are extremely pointed and they
39:32
are still, even when you get out there.
39:35
Now, did you have the 103 plots by 1981, your original?
39:40
You know, I can’t remember.
39:42
I have to think if we started them in ’81 and finished them in ’81.
39:45
Because there was a sequence of ’81 through ’84 of every year.
39:50
Now there wasn’t a Pulse every year, or was there?
39:53
No, there wasn’t a Pulse every year.
39:54
But it was that first year, but you came every year to do your work, correct?
39:57
Right.
39:59
I got funding from Earthwatch, and the Earthwatch volunteers
40:03
helped me put out all these plots.
40:05
I think we got them all out in ’81.
40:07
I have to check the records.
40:09
Then we started monitoring and doing experiments associated with these plots.
40:13
We were monitoring the vegetation as well as seeds coming in
40:17
associated with these plots.
40:18
We did this
40:23
depression and mound experiment.
40:25
I was standing out here once, and I saw this seed go by, and, as it
40:31
went over this depression, it just dropped right out of the wind system.
40:38
I read later [and this was an Epilobium angustifolium, the fireweed] that
40:43
somebody had done wind tunnel experiments and found that a 1% change in humidity
40:48
could cause that plume to close up.
40:51
Pretty amazing.
40:51
I thought - wow, these depressions are really going to be important
40:56
for establishment of the plants, and, so, I set up what we ended
41:00
up calling the depression and mound experiment to document that.
41:06
It’s near about 60 of our plots, and our Earthwatch volunteers dug out a quarter
41:11
meter area, and then we had to put the material somewhere, so we created mounds.
41:14
We went back over the next couple of years and looked at the number of seeds
41:19
and seedlings in the depressions and at a control site, and the mounds.
41:23
We though that it was obvious we were going to find more seeds
41:26
and seedlings in the depression.
41:29
We didn’t.
41:30
You didn’t.
41:32
Okay.
41:32
What we found was there were more seeds and seedlings in the depressions
41:37
than the controls, but they weren’t different from the mounds.
41:42
We think what was happening was that on the mounds you got all
41:46
these spiderwebs setting up.
41:48
The mounds were trapping the seeds in the spiderwebs and they were also
41:52
trapping moisture in the spiderwebs and had some little bitty microtopography.
41:58
And that was more important than the flat areas.
42:02
They were a quarter meter, so they were small, but kind of replicated
42:07
what we have out there now.
42:09
Excuse me, I interrupted you.
42:15
Were there any further flows after the big blast that affected the zone
42:22
that you studied that first year.
42:23
There were some fairly major eruptions, although certainly much lesser
42:28
impact in content than the big one.
42:33
Did any of the later ones, the mudflows, anything affect your
42:36
area that first year anyway?
42:37
Yeah, there were subsequent mudflows.
42:40
I remember coming into the Toutle River valley once and we got a
42:42
message over the radio saying you can’t go down into the valley.
42:45
There’s a mudflow coming.
42:46
We thought, oh this is really cool.
42:47
We get to see a mudflow.
42:50
We were up high on a ridge, on one of these ridges over here
42:53
on the Toutle and looking down and thought this is really cool.
42:57
Then we could see it coming at a distance, and it was really amazing.
43:00
Then when it gets below us, I realized these were giant
43:03
logs that it’s pushing along.
43:06
You think of a mudflow as being small, but the material that it
43:10
was carrying with it was massive.
43:13
That was one of the issues with the initial debris avalanche.
43:16
It picked up all much material.
43:19
It was really scary.
43:20
I was quite a distance away to see the force of the flow.
43:25
These subsequent mudflows have been big, and the erosion as the Toutle
43:31
has been finding itself is phenomenal.
43:34
People call it the Grand Canyon of Mount St. Helens.
43:38
The erosion is just amazing.
43:42
Really deep.
43:43
The other event was we did get ashed upon a couple of times.
43:47
I remember being with Earthwatch volunteers, and they were
43:50
petrified when we were ashed upon, whereas I was really excited.
43:54
I thought this was really cool.
43:58
We were always really excited about the volcanic events.
44:02
But I do remember anther time, officials were concerned about
44:09
legionnaire’s disease for people working in the streams.
44:13
Did they actually know more about legionnaire’s disease by that time
44:17
because it happened in the ‘70s right?
44:18
Right.
44:19
They were just learning about legionnaire’s disease.
44:21
Why were they worried about it here?
44:23
Because people were getting sick that were in the streams.
44:26
Okay.
44:27
There were some illnesses, and officials were concerned.
44:31
We would come through Castle Lake quite a bit, and we would get hot we’d
44:35
jump in the streams, which I remember one time we were out here and had a
44:43
strong smell of sulphur, which is an indication of an impending volcano.
44:48
The radios weren’t telling us anything was going on, but the wind must have shifted,
44:51
and we got this really strong smell of sulphur - especially as we went high.
44:55
So we hiked out of the valley as fast we could.
44:58
And did it erupt?
44:59
No.
44:59
No, it didn’t,
45:02
but we had to check that radio every hour.
45:05
That was part of the permit to allow us in - was to check the radio.
45:09
But we weren’t always able to check our contact at the low elevation, so
45:14
we were constantly climbing up on the hummocks to check in with the radio.
45:18
Obviously, the Pulse and everything that’s happened, this collaborative
45:22
thing, which is really quite an amazing model in the history of
45:26
science, but the first few years whatever was forming was still forming.
45:30
It hadn’t developed its historical inertia, or it was starting to.
45:34
Characterize the collaboration and the people that you were working with and
45:39
how did that happen and how did it go forward and why was that important?
45:43
Well, one thing that was important was the studies got funding really fast.
45:46
I think at
45:49
the time it was the fastest turnaround for NSF funding that had ever happened.
45:54
That was critical.
45:56
I think it was important that there was agreement on where different people
46:00
would be working, because there’s so many different questions here and, because of
46:04
that agreement, we weren’t stepping on each other’s toes and messing up plots.
46:08
I think it was important to have an agreed-upon system of sampling so that
46:13
eventually we could do some comparisons across this area [although that
46:18
comparison hasn’t happened so much].
46:20
Some of it’s in the book you have in your hand, but
46:26
there could be a whole lot more done.
46:28
I think it was great that we were able to work that way.
46:32
Other than those kinds of important things, we didn’t really work
46:38
that much with other groups.
46:40
We shared the bibliography.
46:41
We attended meetings and discussed what we were learning and what they
46:45
were learning, and part of the early Pulses at the Cispus Center was having
46:50
discussions at night so that we could learn what other people were doing.
46:55
That’s when it started becoming evident how these different disturbances were
46:59
going along different successional paths, how very different they were, that it
47:02
wasn’t one kind of disturbance event.
47:04
If we hadn’t been talking together, I don’t think we would have realized that.
47:09
Isn’t it true that ecological science, because of its complexity, almost
47:16
mandates collaboration and sharing?
47:19
It does.
47:23
The International Biological Program
47:28
[IBP] had had Oregon State University as one of its key efforts.
47:31
I’m at Oak Ridge National Lab now, and I had done my Masters at Oak
47:35
Ridge under an IBP project, so that model of looking at large areas as a
47:41
collaborative group and thinking of ecosystem science is very much where my
47:48
training came from and is similar to what Oregon State people were doing because
47:54
they were in that school of thought.
47:56
Interestingly, I found that University of Washington [UW] had more of
48:01
a different school of thought.
48:02
They were more evolutionary ecologists, which is complimentary to ecosystems,
48:08
it’s just a different perspective.
48:10
It was good for my education to be at places that had
48:13
that different perspectives.
48:15
I think Oregon State helped the people at UW learn that their ecosystem
48:22
perspective complemented evolutionary thought, like the presence of all
48:27
these rare species on the volcanos.
48:29
These
48:31
were some ways of thinking that was different among the institutions
48:36
that benefited the science as well.
48:38
If you were going to describe the first five years, or you can even say
48:43
the ‘80s, because you came back in
48:47
’89, how many species did you find?
48:49
What would you characterize as the coverage?
48:53
Just some of the general dynamics of how you classify this study here.
48:57
You going to hand me the book so I can read it?
49:01
No.
49:01
Do you want it?
49:03
I mean if you really want the numbers, I need to look at the data.
49:07
No, just generalize.
49:08
Yeah.
49:08
So, early on there were very few species.
49:12
Many of them were these light-seeded species, but we did find the heavy-seeded
49:18
conifers out here early on as well.
49:21
There were surprises like that.
49:25
You did find traditional successional thought being supported as well
49:30
as other crazy things happening.
49:32
We realized how important randomness was and how very heterogeneous this area is.
49:39
We had 103 plots out there, but we should have had 103,000 or more to
49:46
really capture what was going on.
49:49
There was no way that we were going to understand this area
49:52
without a really detailed study.
49:55
The soils were really important.
49:57
I remember a professor offering and suggesting to me that I go get
50:01
a Ph.D. in soil science because that was what was needed here.
50:06
There were so many different disciplines, but soil dynamics wasn’t being captured.
50:12
Even so, I think we were able to learn a lot early on and have been
50:17
really lucky to continue this study.
50:20
The early ‘80s we started revealing how important alders were, how
50:28
important random events were, and how important the microtopography was.
50:33
I don’t think the other sites have the microtopography elements, or
50:37
even the large topography elements that the debris avalanche does.
50:41
It was funny being at the Pulse this week and seeing all those
50:44
sites and then coming here.
50:46
I just realize this is so different, and most of those people have never
50:50
gotten to the debris avalanche.
50:51
Ever?
50:51
No.
50:52
I don’t think they have.
50:54
They go to the east side of the mountain, and they just don’t
50:55
realize how different it is.
50:57
You could describe it, but they just don’t realize how different it is.
51:01
Some of them go to Johnston Ridge and you can see that area.
51:05
Charlie’s been out here a lot, and Jon Major’s been out here and seen
51:09
the differences, but I think most of the ecologists haven’t really been
51:12
here to see how different it is.
51:18
Tell me about the importance of Charlie Crisafulli.
51:21
Well, Charlie, when he got here and started helping organize the Pulse,
51:27
was really important because I think getting people together and getting
51:32
some interest in continuing and having the collaboration has been great.
51:37
Charlie has the personality to both make the logistics happen and to make everyone
51:41
feel comfortable about doing things.
51:44
I worked with Charlie and Fred on the first book,
51:50
the 25th anniversary book.
51:52
Charlie is meticulous.
51:55
He wants to get it all right.
51:56
It’s really hard to get him to bring things to fruition.
52:00
That’s why we haven’t finished the 35-yearbook yet, but I would rather
52:04
things to be done well than to be done to meet some artificial deadline.
52:09
He has been an amazing glue here to bring people together and to get people to
52:15
meet each other and talk to each other.
52:17
What was his position or funding at the very start and how did that
52:20
change to something permanent?
52:22
Well, as I recall he was working on a Ph.D. with Jim MacMahon on the small
52:28
mammals here and then at some point in time he got hired after the Monument was
52:33
set up because they had some positions to
52:39
engage people to work directly on the mountain itself.
52:48
Was there any heat in any of the upper debris avalanche when you first got here?
52:53
No, it was pretty cold by the time we got here.
52:56
It had been quite warm, at emplacement,
53:01
but it was pretty inert.
53:03
Here comes my glass of refreshment.
53:07
Thank you, Keith.
53:09
I really appreciate it.
53:12
This is our camp thing: wine and time—I’m sorry.
53:16
I’ll step out.
53:17
This is definitely off the record, even though it’s on the record.
53:22
What were the fauna that were down here when you were here?
53:26
I mean you’re doing mainly vegetation, but you also pay attention and you
53:31
see animals that are here or not here?
53:34
What do you remember the first year and maybe the first decade
53:38
and how that evolved from what you remember and studied?
53:42
Well, what was here at first were insects.
53:45
I mentioned the lupine flats, where found these lupines that survived: four of them
53:50
in some places, six of them in others.
53:53
I had worked with lupine on Mount Rainier, and I knew that it is an
53:56
obligate outcrossing species, that is, it has to have a bumblebee move
54:02
the pollen from one plant to another or it’s not going to set seed.
54:05
I thought, this is going to be a classic experiment.
54:08
We’re going to have survivors.
54:09
There are not any bumblebees out here.
54:11
It won’t set seed, and that’ll just be that.
54:16
Well, I saw bumblebees out here in the middle of nowhere kind of making a b-line.
54:21
Subsequently I’ve been out in Lake Washington, and there
54:24
are bumblebees flying across.
54:26
I’ve read since then they can go several miles across inhospitable territory.
54:32
The insects were really important.
54:34
I mentioned that on our mound experiments we started collecting
54:38
all these spiders and spiders were building webs on our seeds traps.
54:43
We caught a lot of spiders.
54:45
I shared those with John Edwards [U.
54:47
of Washington entomologist] and his team.
54:48
The insects were coming in very quickly and that was the major
54:54
component that we saw early on.
54:56
I mentioned the horned caterpillar too, that was very important.
55:01
Now, the Toutle started to flow because of the tunnel, or did
55:07
it start to flow before that?
55:09
It started to flow before that because there was water that
55:12
had to come down the hill.
55:15
The
55:26
Toutle started finding itself early on.
55:28
There were many false starts.
55:30
There were places where it was kind of quicksand-y and
55:33
the Toutle really wasn’t here.
55:39
It was going through; it was percolating through the block.
55:42
It was percolating.
55:42
Right.
55:42
And it finally found itself.
55:44
But we did some work with the fishery biologists who were mainly
55:48
working on the south Toutle who were interested in how sediment
55:56
was affecting the salmon that were coming upstream.
56:00
Our hypothesis was that it was either the shading of the stream, [because it
56:07
was really hot in the water for salmon], or the particles in the stream that was
56:11
going to be detrimental to the fish.
56:16
I did a little study with them, and our model predicted that the alder and
56:20
the poplar, in particular the poplar, would grow up very quickly and shade the
56:24
stream and it would become cool, but the sediment was going to remain a problem.
56:28
That has panned out to be—they are getting fish back but the fish early on
56:33
had quite a bit of abrasions and so the sediments in the streams were important.
56:37
Of course, now we have this history of the sediment retention
56:41
structures that keep the fish out and they are trucked upstream.
56:46
I was at one of our plots,
56:53
and I found this little vole out in the middle of nowhere.
56:56
There was only one plant; you couldn’t see anything else.
56:58
The vole was running under the plant.
57:00
I don’t know how this little vole got out there.
57:03
I caught it with my hands because it was so stressed.
57:06
It was a very difficult time to be out there for any kind of animal.
57:12
Also, there were ponds that were forming.
57:14
Initially each depression was
57:19
oddly shaped.
57:20
There was water seeping through.
57:23
In these depressions water would collect from the rain and maybe even from the
57:28
movement of the water through the system.
57:31
So, these ponds formed.
57:32
It was really cool when you looked down on them, they were all
57:34
different colors depending on the minerals that were in the ponds.
57:38
Fairly early on we started finding tadpoles and little frogs in these
57:42
ponds and that was kind of cool.
57:43
This would be year one or two?
57:44
Like year three or four.
57:46
Three or four?
57:46
Three or four, that you started seeing tadpoles and then you started
57:50
seeing some lizards in there.
57:52
I got a herpetologist to come out and start looking at the fauna.
57:55
Those were the animals that we observed early on.
57:58
Then later the elk started coming.
58:01
It was a great habitat for elk, partly because they put all these
58:05
grass seeds in on the western part of the debris avalanche to support
58:13
what has become a wildlife area.
58:14
So, there are a huge number of elk now.
58:16
[grass seed had been applied by Soil Conservation Service in
58:16
an attempt to control erosion]
58:16
They also wanted a little bit of erosion control, also?
58:18
They wanted it for erosion control, yes.
58:20
Then it accidentally became habitat, right?
58:23
Or they wanted both?
58:25
The seed distributions were done to support wildlife
58:30
as well as erosion control.
58:31
Now there were a lot of elk in here before, right?
58:33
There were some elk, yeah.
58:34
In fact [SS interrupts]
58:35
. So, more afterwards, because the habitat changed in the valley, right?
58:37
Exactly.
58:38
It’s more open.
58:39
After the eruption, there were places up near Coldwater Lake where some
58:45
scientists from the University of Washington Burke Museum had noted
58:48
where there are mounds and under these mounds were bodies of dead elk, so
58:53
they flagged all these mounds early on.
58:55
I went with them some to excavate these elk
59:00
because it was a way to learn how they died during the eruption and
59:04
that helped them understand other kinds of eruptions where they
59:06
didn’t know how the organisms died.
59:10
The elk started coming back into the area in very large number and
59:12
affect the vegetation because they preferentially eat some species.
59:16
We hear the coyotes now quite a bit, but haven’t really seen much evidence of them.
59:22
There’s no wolves in this part of Washington, right?
59:24
I don’t think there are, although they may be someday, but I don’t think they are.
59:28
They’re in Oregon.
59:29
Are they really?
59:29
Yeah.
59:30
Oh cool.
59:31
Not very many, but some.
59:33
Of course, controversial as always.
59:34
Oh yeah.
59:35
Well, if they’re in Oregon they’re going to be here.
59:37
Well, yeah, they got a pretty good range if they want to go somewhere.
59:39
This is a great place for them to be.
59:41
But to me the insects are interesting [and I have some background in entomology]
59:47
and I think insects are cool because ecologically they do everything.
59:50
They’re really important out here.
59:53
Now, how did the chemical
59:57
content of the soils, proto-soils, rock breakdowns, how did that
1:00:03
change over that first decade?
1:00:06
I don’t know that.
1:00:07
I have collected soil samples from all our plots every time we’ve
1:00:10
been out there, and I’m looking for a partner to do soil analysis.
1:00:16
My hypothesis is that the particle size has not changed that much.
1:00:21
We’ve probably gotten a little more silt, particularly where a lot of vegetation
1:00:24
has built up, but that more nutrients have come in, particularly under the alder,
1:00:29
which are nitrogen fixing, and under places where all these elk have defecated
1:00:35
because there’s a lot of elk out there.
1:00:37
We were on our plots today we were looking at some really big plants and our
1:00:41
hypothesis was well, that’s under an elk feces that’s why that plant got so big.
1:00:48
But without experiments and soil samples being analyzed, I don’t know that, and I
1:00:54
think that’s going to be really important.
1:00:56
But the particle size has likely remained the same and that is important because
1:01:01
it’s very sandy soil and that’s very atypical for what you would find in
1:01:06
the Pacific Northwestern United States.
1:01:08
Right.
1:01:10
Even though this was an exciting event for you professionally and it’s
1:01:14
obviously become a major part of your life, but it was also, there was so
1:01:18
much death of plants, animals, people.
1:01:22
That’s true.
1:01:23
Did you have a visceral reaction to that at times.
1:01:26
Can you remember some specific instances early on where you would be taken aback,
1:01:31
maybe even became emotional about what you were witnessing and seeing and finding?
1:01:36
Well, obviously, all the people that died and their stories is tragic as
1:01:41
well as all the animals that died.
1:01:43
When I was walking up this trail right here and came across this cross, which is
1:01:49
a small wooden cross, which means someone was killed right there where we’re working
1:01:54
all the time, it really brings it home.
1:01:57
Still hits you today, huh?
1:01:58
Yeah, that there are people right here basically not very far away.
1:02:03
Do you know the story of who died here?
1:02:05
No, I don’t know who it was.
1:02:08
Somebody in the red zone.
1:02:09
Yeah.
1:02:12
In talking with my friend Keith [Ronnnholm] , who barely made
1:02:14
it out, his story is so real.
1:02:18
Now, were you tempted, or was there an opportunity where, if the scenario had
1:02:23
worked out, that you might have been close at that time or that week, shall we say?
1:02:28
Well, we were coming down quite a bit, but we were mainly going to the south side
1:02:33
for whatever reason and never went to the particular campgrounds that were impacted.
1:02:38
But I was standing below the crater two weeks before it erupted,
1:02:42
as I told you, with the field trip for the seismology society.
1:02:48
If it had been on that Sunday…
1:02:50
Does it ever give you pause to think about how close you were
1:02:53
to the bulge and the whole thing?
1:02:54
Yeah, it’s pretty weird that we were standing right under it and
1:02:57
then thinking when I tell people that story, they say you’re crazy.
1:03:00
But you know it was exciting.
1:03:02
We were thinking - oh this is such a cool thing to do to get to go up and
1:03:05
see the mountain and be under the bulge.
1:03:09
Even the seismologists that were there were all excited and when
1:03:12
they asked, what’s going to happen?
1:03:14
Somebody finally said, “Well, it’s probably going to blow.” But they were
1:03:18
thinking blow up, I think, not blow out.
1:03:24
I remember when I was an unsophisticated person at 21 years old, with no academic
1:03:30
training particularly, I just remember hearing the news reports and something
1:03:34
just told me when I’d see bulge 5 feet a day and I don’t know why, I’m not
1:03:39
claiming to have some great intuition, but it seemed to me that it was going to
1:03:44
be something very unusual and very scary.
1:03:46
I just remember that, thinking back today about 35 years ago.
1:03:50
Well, we thought of it as really exciting that something was going
1:03:54
to happen, which was probably not a good thing to be thinking about.
1:04:00
Did you get to know any of the local people when you were
1:04:02
coming in and out of here.
1:04:04
Oh yeah, yeah.
1:04:05
Because I had my babysitter down the road.
1:04:07
Then when we had all these Earthwatch people here, it was still the red
1:04:11
zone set up in the initial year so we could not camp in here.
1:04:15
We camped at a farmer’s field - pretty much as close as we could.
1:04:19
That farmer was nice and let us
1:04:25
set up tents in his field.
1:04:26
He didn’t use it for that summer and just got some income from our
1:04:30
payment for camping in his field.
1:04:33
One of the funniest times was when I went to the Toutle High School for a safety
1:04:41
presentation that officials were giving.
1:04:43
This was about the problem of Spirit Lake filling up and the concern
1:04:48
about the stability of the debris avalanche to hold back that material.
1:04:52
This was afterwards, of course.
1:04:52
This was after the eruption.
1:04:54
They were concerned about the
1:04:59
debris avalanche breaching and all of the water in Spirit Lake flowing down
1:05:03
through [SS talks over VD] [the town]
1:05:03
. That would have been a catastrophe, another one.
1:05:05
Yeah.
1:05:05
It would have been a really big catastrophe.
1:05:07
So, they had, I think, it was 7 barges up on Spirit Lake pumping
1:05:11
water into another stream system so that it would relieve the pressure.
1:05:16
A presentation was given that said, okay, we know this is a problem.
1:05:23
We have it under control.
1:05:24
USGS has a laser pointed directly at this debris avalanche blockage, and, if that
1:05:32
starts moving, then the signal’s going to go up to a satellite and then it’s
1:05:37
going to come down to Reston, Virginia.
1:05:39
Then they’re going to call by phone to Seattle, Washington, and then
1:05:46
they’re going to call down to Toutle, and they’re going to send helicopters
1:05:49
up and down the valley warning everybody to go to the high ground.
1:05:54
I remember the local sheriff standing up, a country guy, saying, “Well, I
1:06:00
don’t know about you, but when I see those barges floating through town,
1:06:04
I’m going to run for the hills.”
1:06:08
A classic moment, huh?
1:06:09
Right, right.
1:06:12
It was kind of fun to go to local events like that.
1:06:16
There was a place down here we called the permanent garage sale.
1:06:21
They had this garage sale going on for years.
1:06:23
We would come at the beginning of the field season, and we would buy tables
1:06:26
and chairs really cheap and move them up to wherever we were camping, and then
1:06:30
at the end of the season we’d sell them back to the same place and then the next
1:06:34
season we’d do the same thing again.
1:06:37
Of course, this area is one of the more heavily logged areas anywhere, and you
1:06:42
have a very, shall we say, conservative natural resource extraction-based economy
1:06:49
and probably a lot of people that aren’t necessarily scientifically oriented
1:06:54
or fans of the federal government.
1:06:56
What do you remember about their acceptance or lack of acceptance
1:07:00
of all the eggheads from academia, for instance, coming in?
1:07:04
Were they really accepting, or did you feel a lot of
1:07:06
skepticism or just kind of a mix?
1:07:09
Gosh, I always felt acceptance of everything that we did.
1:07:12
The people were really nice.
1:07:15
It was clear there was great interest in building the tourism industry,
1:07:19
because this is a depressed economy still, and the tourism industry
1:07:25
should be adding more to it.
1:07:28
People were interested in actually having a connection to what was
1:07:31
going on, because a lot of it was, they felt beyond their reach.
1:07:36
It was a red zone.
1:07:38
It was places they couldn’t get in.
1:07:39
They appreciated learning what was going on and understood why it was protected
1:07:45
but felt like this was part of their community, and they wanted to know about
1:07:52
it.
1:07:53
I’m going to ask one or two more questions.
1:07:56
Virginia and I are going to take a break in this interview right now.
1:08:00
We are going to recommence the interview in Baltimore, Maryland
1:08:03
at the ESA conference on one of the days between August 10 and August 14.
