00:02
Good morning, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State University.
00:05
I am here with Dr. Virginia Dale, Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
00:09
We are in the Baltimore Convention Center at the Ecological
00:14
Society of America Conference.
00:16
We are going to complete the second half, shall we say, of an oral history
00:20
interview that we started last week at the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic
00:26
Monument basically in the debris flow
00:31
avalanche deposit.
00:33
Correct.
00:34
I got it right this time.
00:34
Yeah.
00:35
And the other correction I want to add is it’s Oak Ridge
00:37
National Laboratory [singular].
00:40
Oh, did I say laboratories?
00:42
Yeah, minor issue.
00:44
Okay.
00:45
Thank you for correcting me.
00:47
It’s been made before.
00:49
Okay.
00:49
So, we did what we could last time and it was a very hot day
00:56
and we went as far as we could.
00:58
You basically stopped early in your history of working with Mount St. Helens.
01:03
You of course went through how you got to know the mountain, how you set
01:06
up your plots, how you experienced the eruption and the post-eruption
01:11
landscape, the initial Pulses.
01:14
What you want to do is maybe recommence in the early mid-‘80s and pick up your
01:20
work and how it proceeded from that point.
01:23
I’ll just let you take it from there, and then I’ll ask
01:25
questions, as I see appropriate.
01:27
Okay, so there was all this excitement in 1980 and ’81 that was met by a
01:35
number of researchers doing their work on different areas of the mountain.
01:39
As I said, we focused on the debris avalanche deposit, which was really
01:43
exciting and we’re part of the initial NSF funding that was led
01:48
by Larry Bliss and Jerry Franklin.
01:51
After the initial pulse of funding, it became more difficult to obtain funding.
01:56
We were very lucky to be able to attain funding from the National
02:01
Geographic Society and from organizations such as Earthwatch and the
02:15
Center for Field Research that enabled volunteers to come help us do the
02:20
work as well as help pay for the work.
02:23
We ended up early on having many teams of volunteers, which has been real
02:27
important to the work that we’ve done.
02:29
Because early on when we set up these permanent plots it
02:32
took some work to set them up.
02:34
We physically had to carry out a lot of hardware that we then put in place,
02:39
which was rebar, and then we had to go through and measure the plots.
02:43
Measuring the plots was mainly looking for plants and then
02:49
identifying what they were.
02:50
Early on just finding the plants was hard, and we learned that some people had a good
02:55
eye for these teeny little cotyledons that you would see, and other people didn’t.
03:00
Then we would have a botanist with each team that, once we found the plants,
03:04
we could identify what they were.
03:06
Other work that we did was set up seed traps that we monitored over time.
03:12
We had to do that every 10 days or less.
03:16
We had these frames we first established, and then we put sticky material on
03:21
them, replace them with sticky material and then counted the number of seeds.
03:26
Again, we had trained botanists on our team to identify the species.
03:30
We found things that were contrary to what one would observe, one would have thought
03:37
about from typical successional processes.
03:40
For example, we found the number of seeds was highest in the center of the debris
03:46
avalanche, which was furthest from areas that were not impacted, contrary to
03:50
what you would learn in ecology class.
03:54
We think that’s perhaps because the prevailing winds were coming up the
03:59
valley along the center of the streambed and that’s where it was carrying all
04:04
these seeds and not from the closer areas that had not been disturbed along the
04:10
edge of the debris avalanche deposit.
04:12
We initially started finding very different things.
04:15
I don’t know how much I’m repeating of what I’ve said earlier.
04:17
Did I say that?
04:18
You said that part earlier.
04:21
When you do a two-part thing like this, there are going to be redundancies
04:25
because there are certain things that are part of your pro forma responses
04:28
to certain things, so that’s perfectly acceptable and understandable.
04:34
We had these teams of researchers through 1984 and 1985 that were really important
04:40
for setting up different experiments.
04:43
Then, thereafter, we started coming back every 5 years.
04:47
That’s where the logistical support of the Forest Service was really important
04:51
in getting non-standard funds, like from National Geographic, were really
04:55
important to allow us to come out and continue revisiting our plots.
05:02
The Forest Service not only provided us with tables and chairs and some
05:07
of that, but some of the years they provided us with the services of
05:11
a botanist, like Elsie Denton, who you met, during our field work.
05:16
We first met her in
05:23
2010 when she helped our team.
05:24
Then this year she was a volunteer on our team.
05:28
Throughout the years we’ve had a number of untrained people, but especially
05:32
valuable were the trained botanists who were taking their time to help us.
05:36
That’s been great.
05:39
We have been able to monitor every 5 years since 1985, these plots, and what we’ve
05:45
found is that there’s been an increase in the cover of the plant species that are
05:51
there with a peak in cover in 2004 and then it’s slightly declining, but we’re
05:59
getting some shifting of the species composition more towards species that
06:04
you would find in a forest situation as canopy cover has been established.
06:10
That canopy cover, as you saw out there, is largely alder, but we are getting
06:14
some conifers, like Douglas-fir, are now seeding on the debris avalanche deposit.
06:18
And, we are getting some of the true firs and some the western hemlock,
06:23
which is more of a late-successional species that you would expect to
06:27
see later on coming into play.
06:30
That has been a very important part of the process.
06:34
Interestingly, we found these late successional species very early on.
06:39
They were coming in early.
06:41
They’re just slow growing in many cases.
06:43
When they did not get eaten by the elk, the elk story is an important part of
06:48
this process, they survived and, although the true fir and the hemlock have not
06:54
seeded yet, they may in 10 or 20 years and that’s going to be important to
07:00
the successional dynamics that we see.
07:03
The volunteers that you got, were they students like REU type programs?
07:09
Or?
07:10
Well, sometimes I had students, particularly when I was working in
07:13
the Pacific Northwest, because I was at several different universities.
07:17
Those students would come along.
07:18
But the really excellent professionals I’m getting are
07:23
established botanists in the area.
07:27
For instance, we had someone who recently retired from the
07:29
California Native Plant Society.
07:31
We have some rare species specialists from California: Bob Holland and Ginny
07:35
Daines, who have been working with us since the early 1980s and they are
07:40
excellent taxonomists and to me the taxonomy is really the difficult task:
07:47
figuring out what those plants are.
07:49
In September and next month, we are going to have a taxonomy party in California
07:55
where we have taken our pressed specimens.
07:57
Because the plants that we don’t know we press and then we will go
08:02
and work with microscopes to try and identify what those plants are.
08:06
I have done that before in the past: gone to California to work
08:09
with the botanists there who have helped me with plant identification.
08:14
So, it’s not just the field work.
08:15
How many new species have you developed, I mean, discovered at Mount St. Helens?
08:22
Okay, I don’t know what you mean by new species?
08:26
Well, I’m not assuming some weird nuclear mutation.
08:30
That’s not what I want to make it sound like, but new species to the area?
08:39
Okay, we have found all the species that were present on Mount St. Helens
08:44
before, as obtained from a list of St. John and other people who work
08:50
there previously, have all come back.
08:53
What we’re finding is that some of the non-natives are very important.
08:57
But we haven’t found any new species to the region per se.
09:03
We have, I was going to look at my list of the number of species total,
09:08
because that would be important for you to know, if you wait a second here.
09:11
I think I asked you that when we were out in the field, and you
09:13
asked me to look at the book.
09:16
You have the book.
09:19
Yeah, and maybe while I’m looking this up, I should refer to the
09:24
book, because [SS interrupts]
09:26
. I don’t have it with me, so.
09:27
Well, I’m going to get it on your record, the fact that we have a book
09:33
summarizing what happened 25 years after the eruption in which we had most of the
09:38
main researchers who have been working, some short-term some longer-term, prepare
09:44
a chapter that summarize their work.
09:46
I find again and again this book, this compilation, of the different
09:53
research efforts that are ongoing is really a valuable source and
09:58
Charlie Crisafulli and Fred Swanson worked with me in editing this book.
10:03
In particular, our chapter one is looking at how Mount St. Helens fits
10:08
into other volcanic studies in the region, and our second to last chapter
10:15
looks at the management implications, and the final chapter looks at the key
10:20
lessons learned, and we had a paper in Science that also summarizes those.
10:25
All of those chapters are really important to the synthesis activity.
10:29
Now Charlie and I are working on the 35th anniversary book.
10:33
When I go to ecologists, like we’re meeting at the Ecological Society
10:37
of America, they are more aware of the publications that have come out
10:42
than of the intense efforts that we were involved such as a couple
10:45
of weeks ago as part of the Pulse.
10:47
There are different ways to reach the communities.
10:50
The Pulse reaches the researchers who are involved.
10:53
Publications and presentations like you’re hearing at this meeting reach
10:57
the wider ecological audience as well as those who are not so familiar with
11:04
the ecological studies that go on.
11:09
Okay, so I’m looking at my species lists and
11:16
the total number of vascular plants that we have is about 225.
11:21
That’s many, many plants.
11:23
In the debris avalanche area?
11:24
On the debris avalanche area.
11:26
And what’s interesting is over the 35 years of this work, we found that the
11:31
scientific names for 36 species, 15% of our sample, have changed names.
11:37
That’s partly because of all the genetics work that’s been done intermediate.
11:40
One of the challenges of working in this area is dealing with all
11:45
the changes that occur, and one of them is the change in taxonomy.
11:49
Because the sophistication of the field is greater, and you’re able to differentiate
11:54
on a finer, more detailed level.
11:56
Right.
11:57
So, we have to know what we were calling earlier as Festuca
12:02
myuros is now Vulpia myuros.
12:05
Keeping our long-term record straight, now I have in our long-term records as
12:11
well as in our list, a list of the current names, and what the prior name was.
12:18
Some of those have changed several times.
12:20
This is one of the challenges of long-term research.
12:23
As well as when we first started this and put out our permanent
12:26
plots, we had no GPS, no GIS.
12:30
Then over time that came into play.
12:32
When we first got the GIS locations for our plots, you may
12:37
recall, that it was not accurate.
12:40
The GIS technology was largely being used by the military and, so, they
12:46
offset the points by a certain distance, and, when we subsequently went out
12:51
and we realized all our points were offset, we couldn’t figure it out.
12:54
And then we remembered in the 5 years since we’ve been there the
12:58
military had decided everyone was breaking this code anyway to
13:01
release what the real location was.
13:05
Go figure, the military because they don’t want to show the real targets, right?
13:09
That’s right.
13:10
But for ecological research, that made a real difference.
13:14
When we first put these plots out, fortunately, there was not
13:16
much out there, so it was pretty easy to go find our points.
13:21
Like the first day of our fieldwork this time was to find one of
13:25
our plots and to sample it.
13:28
Just finding the plot took a little bit of time because we had to know
13:31
which projection system we were [using] , and some of the team when
13:34
they had their GPS units out were monitoring with different projection
13:38
systems and then our plots are marked by rebar, which doesn’t look that big.
13:45
It’s about the size of your finger coming out of a forest where many of the
13:51
alder trees are about that same size.
13:53
Fortunately, now the trees have gotten a little bigger, but in 2004 and in 2000 it
13:59
was more challenging to find the plots.
14:01
Then our whole team, because we had a big team this year, all did one plot together
14:06
to make sure that we agreed taxonomically.
14:10
We were agreeing on what we call the plants.
14:12
We had agreed on methodology and making sure that we
14:18
provided the information accurately and systematically.
14:22
That’s always important.
14:23
And that’s the value of having the three of us, me and Bob Holland and
14:29
Ginny Daines, who have been part of the sampling team over this 35-year period.
14:34
Tell me about Bob and Ginny, just because of that long
14:38
relationship and just meeting them.
14:40
They’re very interesting people.
14:42
They are, they are.
14:43
So, they heard we were involved in Mount St. Helens and they picked
14:46
up the phone and said we’re coming.
14:49
They have come every year.
14:52
This year, in particular, they have been very valuable because several of their
14:56
botanical colleagues have come as well.
15:00
Having skilled botanists is really critical to this kind of work and
15:06
my job, I know the common plants, but I’m not trained in taxonomy.
15:11
I’m trained in ecology, but I’ve been able to keep the records,
15:14
which is another critical part.
15:15
People like that are kind of your eyes in the field, more or less.
15:19
Well, I can be the eyes in the field but the work we’re going to do in
15:22
September to make sure we get the plants right is really critical.
15:27
But we need lots of eyes because these are big, 250 m2 plots and being
15:33
able to see and differentiate among the plants and make sure we get the
15:36
plant names correct is critical.
15:39
That’s why we have all these voucher samples we take back so that we can
15:42
compare from plot to plot to plot.
15:45
For every plot we have a big plastic bag, and sometimes two or three.
15:50
We put samples from that plot and then in September we’re going to make sure that
15:55
between plots we’re calling, particularly the grasses, those are always the hard
15:59
ones, the same name for consistency.
16:02
And we have those samples from prior years, too, to make sure we’re consistent.
16:05
Now, where are all those samples stored at?
16:07
They are in Oak Ridge.
16:10
Maybe someday we will put them in a repository, but, as we continue
16:14
these plots, it’s better to keep them with me so I know where to access
16:22
them.
16:22
There we talked about having a Mount St. Helens research center of sorts?
16:27
Yes, and Charlie Crisafulli is very interested in making sure that happens.
16:31
There’s interest in having it at Oregon State University.
16:34
Some of the samples are stored in different places.
16:36
I think I probably put some in the University of Washington
16:39
herbarium, because I was working there in many of the early years.
16:43
I think, and I’m not positive about this, that many of the animal samples
16:47
are at Utah State University, because so many of Jim MacMahon’s students
16:52
were involved in the initial studies.
16:54
They are not in one repository.
16:57
But the team, I’ll use that term broadly, is very aware of the
17:02
need to have a consistent place where people can go for samples.
17:07
Another valuable resource that I am personally maintaining is soil samples
17:11
that I have from each of these plots on which we’ve done very limited work.
17:15
We did some initial work on soils, and I did some microbial work from some of the
17:20
soils, but every year we’ve been out there we’ve collected soil samples from each of
17:27
the plots and I would be very interested in having the analysis done on these.
17:31
That may happen as a result of some of the contacts I’ve made at the Pulse this year.
17:36
For instance, my sense from what you’re saying is that whatever samples in
17:41
whatever studies with whatever PIs would happen to be in the purview and probably
17:45
within whatever university or institution they respectively came from, correct?
17:50
Correct.
17:50
Correct.
17:51
One of the problems with these herbaria—that’s the name for the
17:54
plant samples—there was an article in Science recently about how
17:57
funding for herbaria is going away.
18:01
Some herbaria are closing and then, occasionally, I would hope always, they
18:06
are consolidating their work into another existing herbarium, but maintaining these
18:11
samples and having funding to maintain these samples is always a challenge.
18:16
What is the storage requirements, in terms of humidity and temperature, an
18:20
ideal scenario for that, for example?
18:22
Well, you want to keep it dry, and you don’t want to have a fire.
18:26
Fire is the big hazard.
18:27
So, it’s pretty simple.
18:28
It’s not quite like archives like we do where you’re worried about
18:31
humidity and temperatures and stuff.
18:33
You have a little more leeway, but still similar concerns.
18:36
Yeah, yeah.
18:37
I mean you don’t want to have it too hot, but dryness is the main thing.
18:42
Most buildings in the U.S. are air conditioned and have some kind of
18:45
humidity control, so it’s not major.
18:48
It’s when you go to the tropics that you have some really
18:51
major, major control problems.
18:54
Fire is always an issue.
18:57
Anyway, I could go on about that but that’s not an issue here.
19:02
What surprised you most about the colonization process that you witnessed
19:07
from the beginning to even today?
19:10
Either a general dynamic or a specific species?
19:16
There were a couple of things.
19:17
One is how random it was.
19:19
We had been led by reading ecology texts that it was going to be an
19:23
ordered progression and one species would make way for the next and that
19:29
you would have physical changes to the substrate and to the surface that
19:36
would allow other plants to come in.
19:39
We found that the location was pretty random and also the species that came in.
19:46
We found that all species in the area were observed on the debris
19:49
avalanche deposit fairly quickly, particularly ones that we had heretofore
19:55
called late successional species.
19:58
I learned in ecology texts, and it’s still being taught in ecology texts, that you
20:02
have first the early successional species characterized by being very small, light
20:10
seeds that are wind dispersed that will germinate in high light conditions that
20:17
can survive in a variety of conditions come early, and you only find the later
20:22
successional species that have heavy seeds, that aren’t so adapted to wind
20:26
dispersal, that typically only grow in the shade - only those occur later.
20:31
We did find an abundance of these “early successional species” early
20:35
on, but we also found that the late successional species were there, and,
20:39
as I’ve said, the species like the true fir and the western hemlock are present
20:47
and are growing very well. They look very healthy. The randomness is what
20:52
you don’t read about in ecology texts.
20:55
The ordered progression just does not occur.
21:01
Why do you think that paradigm has fought change?
21:04
Or, I won’t say it fought change because it sounds like it’s an active thing, but
21:08
why do you think it’s not changed quickly?
21:11
Well, one thing is many of the textbooks are rehashings of
21:17
prior versions of the textbooks.
21:20
If they do talk about something like Mount St. Helens, they will have it as
21:24
an aside and they will say: “And this is what we find at Mount St. Helens.”
21:31
Science seeks order and rules.
21:36
Saying that there are random phenomena does not meet that paradigm.
21:42
But this is the way it is.
21:46
We want to say a simplified order of things, and it isn’t always the case.
21:54
Reality is messy.
22:02
What are some of the things that you found extremely important for
22:05
you to learn from your colleagues that were doing other studies at St.
22:09
Helens, especially the people you’ve known for many years that are doing
22:12
different things around the area?
22:15
Oh, gosh, there are so many different things that we’ve learned.
22:18
One of the things that’s really been important at Mount St. Helens is
22:22
initially we understood that this volcanic eruption was not just one event.
22:27
There were several different
22:31
volcanic phenomena that occurred: the debris avalanche, the pyroclastic
22:34
flows, the blowdowns, the mudflows, etc., and understanding the ecological
22:40
processes that prevailed in each of those regions has been really interested
22:46
and subsequent we have looked at other types of large-scale disturbances.
22:51
We had a workshop on what we call LIDS, large infrequent disturbances, and
22:58
we’ve learned that other events, other disturbances, are not uniform either.
23:02
This phenomenon, this concept that disturbances are a single thing, just
23:08
doesn’t hold hardly ever, either.
23:11
It might hold in a managed agricultural system, where the disturbance might
23:15
be going through it with a plow.
23:17
But when natural disturbances occur, there are fringes around the edges, there
23:21
are areas that are harder hit in terms of impact, the frequency and duration
23:26
of different events are different, and the actual phenomena are very different.
23:31
So, the ecological responses have been different.
23:34
Hearing about the gophers that survived in some areas and that
23:39
the brought the seeds up is really fascinating, but that just does not
23:42
occur on the debris avalanche deposit, where it’s 45 m deep on the average.
23:47
Hearing
23:49
about subsequent disturbances on the pyroclastic flow area where there
23:54
were subsequent flows coming down from the mountain is very different
23:58
than the subsequent disturbances we had on the debris avalanche deposit
24:02
where it was mud flows or droughts.
24:05
So, this comparison has been fascinating to hear about, and I think the collective
24:10
story that we all tell is very valuable.
24:13
That’s why I was referring to the book earlier, because only in that kind of
24:18
synthesis volume where you can hear in depth each of the stories that go
24:23
along with the different disturbance types and then put them together into
24:26
a synthesis is really interesting.
24:29
I think that has helped us learn about management systems.
24:34
Another thing that I think is important, maybe because I work at an applied
24:39
laboratory, I always think about what is going on in the world more than
24:44
some of my university colleagues.
24:48
What I have learned on the debris avalanche deposit, I think, is
24:50
highly applicable to other types of disturbances, and I don’t hear that
24:55
so much from my other colleagues, and so they’re searching for similarities
25:00
with natural and managed events.
25:03
For example, what of your other colleagues are, and maybe what fields
25:07
would you characterize as trying to still find an analogy or an exact example?
25:13
An example I heard about last week was all the logs floating on the
25:19
lakes that are still there.
25:21
Spirit Lake and Coldwater?
25:22
On Spirit Lake, yeah, and Castle have all these logs, and there’s been some
25:24
really interesting research about that impact, but it sounded like the
25:28
researchers doing that work had struggled to find how that was analogous to other
25:33
managed systems, but actually it is.
25:36
In the eastern United States where they did a lot of logging, they had
25:40
a lot of material that came down and then subsequently sank and is
25:45
still in some of those rivers and ponds, and now they’re pulling out.
25:50
To me, it’s kind of natural to look at those analogies, partly because
25:54
some of my other work has been looking at sustainable agriculture, land-use
25:59
planning, those kinds of things.
26:01
Besides the Mount St. Helens work, I have had a very active research
26:05
program in land management and that’s helped me kind of understand how what
26:10
we learn at St. Helens applies to different systems around the world.
26:18
Now, I believe you also had some input on the planning for
26:23
the volcanic monument, correct?
26:25
Okay, so there were several aspects to management, and
26:28
I’ll start very general first.
26:32
Immediately after the eruption, there was two million dollars available
26:37
within 6 months, a short-term period, in order to protect the downstream
26:45
areas from any kind of hazards.
26:47
There was real concern about this situation because those communities had
26:50
been greatly impacted by the eruption.
26:54
One of these efforts was the seeding planned by the Soil Conservation Service?
26:58
Did I talk about this?
27:00
Okay, and so the Soil Conservation Service, which has now become the
27:05
Natural Resources Conservation Service [the name has changed under USDA], was
27:09
very interested in stopping erosion.
27:14
As I said, this was a real concern.
27:16
But subsequently we learned that the kind of erosion that occurred on the debris
27:19
avalanche deposit is sheet erosion.
27:20
It’s massive erosion, which no kind of plants could have stopped.
27:26
This was new material that was not going to stay in place.
27:30
It was going to move.
27:31
You’re talking about the ash and the tephra and all the things that
27:35
were just kind of laying around and became eroded however they were
27:38
going to become eroded, correct?
27:39
I am talking about the debris avalanche deposit, largely [not the ash or tephra].
27:42
Oh, okay.
27:42
This was the mountain that tumbled down and just haphazardly fell, and
27:47
there was a major river, the Toutle River, which had to find its path.
27:51
In the early years there was no river.
27:53
There was quicksand in places, and the river had to emerge and created what some
27:58
people now refer to as the Grand Canyon of Mount St. Helens as it found its way.
28:04
There was great concern as that happened, for it could happen in such a way
28:07
that it would impact downstream areas.
28:11
These rivers have filled much of the riparian systems in all the
28:13
way down to the Columbia River.
28:15
They’ve become non-navigable, so they’ve had to dredge a lot of the material out.
28:20
If this happened all in one major pulse of movement, for instance, if Spirit Lake
28:30
lost the plug of the debris avalanche holding it back, that
28:33
would wash out many of the homes that have survived the 1980 eruption.
28:37
There was real concern about this.
28:39
The Soil Conservation Service wanted to seed the entire area with
28:44
some seeds that it had available.
28:47
We called them up and talked to them and the seeds they had available is what
28:50
they typically spread along highways.
28:53
It’s a lot of non-natives, a few native species [largely selected for quick
28:59
establishment], some nitrogen fixers, and some species that would support wildlife.
29:04
But they didn’t include in the seed mix any of the native species you would
29:08
expect to do really well, like alder.
29:10
I asked them, “Why aren’t you going to use red alder?” They
29:12
said that they didn’t have seeds.
29:16
One of the actions we initially took was at a meeting that summer of an
29:21
international group supporting systematics and taxonomy, I could look it up and
29:26
give you the formal name in, several of us went and had petitions and asked
29:32
the international scientists to sign a request to the US Congress not to spend
29:37
that money on seeding of these non-native plants over the entire mountain.
29:42
How expensive would that be for example, approximately?
29:45
Two million dollars.
29:47
Serious money.
29:48
Yeah, serious money.
29:50
So, they did not seed the entire mountain, but they did seed part of it.
29:55
Which part, do you know?
29:56
They seeded some areas around the edges.
29:59
They seeded some areas out where there had been blast and heavy ash
30:06
deposits, as well as they seeded on the debris avalanche deposit.
30:10
I was out there and was seeded upon by one of these helicopters.
30:14
That was very disconcerting.
30:18
However, it ended up being an unintentional experiment,
30:20
because I was right there and could see where the seeds fell.
30:23
I knew that 11 of our plots of the 103 we initially laid out had seeds on them.
30:33
Subsequently the plants of the plots grew.
30:35
In fact, I could show you a picture
30:39
of how prevalent the impact still is if you’ll take a break here.
30:42
Yeah, let me turn it off.
30:46
So, one of the results that I’m going to talk about at our meeting
30:51
that I’m at tomorrow is the effect of the areas that were seeded versus
30:57
unseeded still, for 30 years later there is much greater cover and number
31:03
of species than the unseeded plots.
31:05
When we talked to the Soil Conservation Service at the time, they said well,
31:08
we’re just doing this to reduce erosion and it won’t have a long-term impact.
31:13
It does have a long-term impact.
31:16
Even 30 years later, we’re still following that to see what the effect might be.
31:22
There are a lot of non-native plants out there, but on these seeded plots
31:26
there still are more non-native plants.
31:29
We found early on that there was greater mortality of the trees
31:34
that occurred on the seeded plots.
31:35
We think that was because in those areas [I thought I could show it to
31:41
you] where there were lots of grasses, a big outbreak of mice that occurred.
31:45
During the winter, the mice didn’t have much to eat under the snow and
31:49
they would go around chewing the bark [girdling the trees] . Although trees
31:54
died, not all of them survived, and there was some mortality in both the
31:57
unseeded and seeded areas, but there was greater mortality in those seeded areas.
32:02
How far is this picture up the debris avalanche, for instance,
32:05
from where your camp was?
32:06
Not very far.
32:09
The area where we were camping, all those plants right there, many of those, are
32:14
still a result of that initial seeding.
32:16
When you go further up you don’t see as many of those non-native grasses
32:22
as we saw where we were camping.
32:23
There’s still [SS interrupts]
32:24
. Is that because there was a limitation on where they spread it because they
32:27
were spreading it lower down, like you said, on the fringe areas, correct?
32:30
Yes.
32:30
They spread it lower down, and they had different seed mixes
32:34
on the debris avalanche deposit than they had in the blast zone.
32:39
Our evidence shows that the places where they seeded still have
32:42
quite a strong long-term effect.
32:44
This information is really valuable for understanding other managed areas.
32:49
Now, since that time what has now become the Natural Resource Conservation
32:53
Service has 17 native plant nurseries that are distributed around the United
32:57
States that provide native seeds that are particular to that region.
33:01
At the time, they didn’t have those kinds of things.
33:04
Where’s the one for the Northwest now, do you know?
33:06
I don’t know.
33:07
I think it’s in Oregon, but I’m not really sure.
33:09
I
33:11
could look it up, but I don’t know.
33:13
Anyway, but they have these region-specific nurseries, but at the
33:14
time people weren’t thinking about the value of using native plants.
33:19
If they had seeded with alder, we would have gotten a very different kind of
33:23
story than now on those seeded areas than what you have with these grasses, because
33:28
the grasses are in some sense competing with some of the native vegetation.
33:32
Now the alder was not conceived as something to be feasible, because
33:37
people thought it was too dry, correct?
33:39
Okay, for
33:42
the seed mix they didn’t use the alder seed because they didn’t have it.
33:46
Because when I suggested alder, they said, well, we don’t have the seeds.
33:50
The other part of the story you’re alluding to is when I talk to ecologists
33:56
about what was going to happen in this area and propose that alder was
34:00
going to be the real story people were surprised at that, because you do think
34:03
of red alder as a wet site species and this is highly sandy material.
34:10
There’s not much water, not much nutrients.
34:13
They didn’t think alder would do well.
34:15
As you saw out there, alder is part of the story.
34:17
It’s doing quite well in parts.
34:19
Yeah, it is.
34:20
One part [SS interrupts]
34:21
. And cottonwood, too, though right?
34:22
Well, the cottonwood is not doing very well because it is one of
34:26
the preferred species of elk.
34:28
Although we did find a few very large cottonwood in our plots, we noted early
34:35
on that if they got past the level of elk browse that they were going to do well,
34:40
but many of the cottonwood you see are heavily browsed and just don’t make it.
34:47
Although the cottonwoods are very abundant and the seeds come in and
34:52
they can grow fast, the elk are so abundant that they eat them up
34:58
and most cottonwood don’t survive.
35:00
The elk and the other plants and animals are very important
35:05
in terms of what’s going on.
35:09
You asked me earlier, what have I learned from other researchers, and one of
35:12
them is the importance of herbivores, the insects as well as the elk.
35:17
We’ve seen some of that, obviously, ourselves, but having the documentation
35:21
of that work has been very important for our understanding of the vegetation.
35:25
But, going back to the management story, part of the management early on was
35:30
thinking about what the US Government was doing to manage this natural disturbance.
35:37
What we’ve learned in our study with these large, infrequent disturbances,
35:41
not just at Mount St. Helens, is the initial reaction to any kind of large
35:46
disturbance is what can we do about it?
35:49
How can we fix it?
35:53
A lot of these places cannot be fixed in the sense of going back to what they
35:57
were immediately before the disturbance.
36:01
That’s not a problem.
36:04
We can learn from these situations.
36:05
For instance, in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Hugo the immediate reaction was
36:10
to go in and clean up some of the streams where a lot of debris fell in the streams.
36:14
Yet they found afterwards, that compared to streams that were not cleaned up,
36:19
the ones that were left alone had much greater diversity and soil retention.
36:24
This concept of fixing and cleaning up is often a part of management
36:32
understanding in the U.S. or elsewhere.
36:35
We’re trying through our research at St. Helens to think about what
36:39
a messy, diverse ecosystem really means and the benefits that it has.
36:45
To me, that is one of the true lessons from St. Helens that we still need
36:49
to get out there, that ecosystems are often a beautiful mess and have lots of
36:55
service values, if we keep that mess.
37:00
The seeding is also a big part of the story.
37:03
Another big part of the story that Jon Major can probably tell you
37:07
better about is the activities to reduce the erosion that occurred.
37:13
Part of that story was putting an erosion dam [Corps of Engineers,
37:16
Sediment Retention Structure] in the early ‘80s on the Toutle River.
37:21
The plan was to create two basins, so that the Toutle would be flowing
37:26
through one basin and slowing down so all the sediments in it would deposit.
37:31
When that basin got filled, they’d switch the flow to another basin
37:34
and then dredge out the first one.
37:36
Then the operation would switch back to the other basin and dredge out the second
37:39
one, so it’d be a continual operation.
37:41
They were trying to save the lower Toutle, the Cowlitz, and even
37:44
the Columbia from [VD interrupts]
37:47
. From those deposits, yeah.
37:49
But there was one big mudflow event and it filled up both basins immediately.
37:54
That was, I can’t remember the price, a million dollars or so,
38:00
that was immediately filled up.
38:03
So, now they have constructed a hard rock dam that is being used to retain the
38:10
sediments as well, and that is filling up, of course, quicker than predicted and
38:15
they’re not sure what to do about that.
38:16
One of the problems with the new dam is it does not have any ladders for the
38:20
salmon that would go upstream, so now they’re trucking the salmon upstream
38:24
because the adult salmon can’t get past this hard rock barrier; although the
38:28
young salmon can get through the dam.
38:31
So, there are salmon coming up the Toutle?
38:33
Oh, yeah, there are salmon coming up.
38:35
Are they coming up as far, what lakes are they coming up into, do you know?
38:38
I don’t know.
38:39
I don’t know the story.
38:41
But the fish people have some interesting stories to tell, and we worked closely
38:44
with the fish people early on to try to determine whether the temperature
38:50
in these streams was going to be a problem versus the sediments.
38:53
Our studies showed that the projected alder growth was going to be so
38:58
fast that they were going to shade these streams enough to reduce the
39:01
temperature and that’s what happened.
39:06
So, the salmon are coming back.
39:08
But, let’s get back to the management story.
39:10
Yeah, let’s talk about the management story and how that developed
39:13
beyond what you’ve already said.
39:14
Right.
39:14
So, we have the soils and all the sediment and erosion issues.
39:19
Then, early on there was concern about what was going to eventually happen
39:25
to these lands, because, as you know, it was a patchwork of ownerships.
39:28
The mountain [top] itself was owned by the railway company.
39:32
The state owned productive lands in the area that were used for forest
39:36
[ry] . There were private companies, like Weyerhaeuser was the big landowner
39:40
that owned lands that had been in production, and then some of it was under
39:45
the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.
39:48
There was great interest in preserving the area in some way, and several of
39:52
us realized early on that a national monument was a way to do this.
39:58
My colleagues and I started distributing petitions [and I will send you some
40:03
of those that we sent to universities across Washington and Oregon] and got
40:09
numerous signatures from the science community saying there is great value
40:15
in establishing a national monument.
40:18
There were, of course, other people from different communities,
40:22
with different interests, that also endorsed this concept.
40:27
Collectively, I think this worked so that our government eventually
40:33
did establish a national monument.
40:35
I got very involved in these political discussions.
40:39
Maybe I mentioned that I was at home in my kitchen one day and Congressman
40:44
Sid Morrison called me up to talk to me about this, and I remember thinking, Sid
40:49
Morrison, Sid Morrison: I know that name!
40:51
Is he from Washington State?
40:52
Yeah, from Washington State, and I was trying to think, who is it?
40:54
I know that name.
40:56
Fortunately, I didn’t ask him who are you but remembered him.
41:00
He was really interesting because, as a farmer, he understood a lot of
41:04
the processes we were talking about.
41:06
His concern was the long term.
41:08
He thought - sure, it looks really interesting now and people would be
41:11
interested and there’s lots of research activities, but in some years, some
41:14
decades, it’s going to look like it did before, maybe, and then what’s the value
41:19
of having this long-term monument set up.
41:21
He was personally interested in having that discussion, which was fabulous to
41:25
me that he understood enough and was able to be convinced that there was
41:31
long-term value in preserving the area.
41:34
The document that I sent you was the document that established the
41:39
Mount St. Helens National Monument.
41:41
I also have the full record, which, if you don’t have you should get
41:45
a hold of, of all the testimony that occurred in Washington.
41:50
The congressional record is very important and gives the written testimony, as
41:56
well as the actual testimony, because people say things a little different
42:02
that was in prepared written statements, and I think the book probably has the
42:04
subsequent hearings that were held around the Pacific Northwest with local
42:10
groups that were very interested in the possibility of establishing a monument.
42:16
As a result of those hearings, you see the house legislation
42:21
that establishes the monument.
42:23
Part of the debate about this monument was -is it to be established under
42:26
Park Service or Forest Service, because most of the monuments are established
42:32
under Park Service, although there are some under the Forest Service.
42:36
Historically, many of the Forest Service monuments have become national parks.
42:43
There was concern among the Forest Service representatives that this would happen.
42:48
However, there are a number of Forest Service monuments that are retained, and
42:54
the collective understanding was there was great value in retaining and protecting
43:00
this area as a national monument.
43:03
That is what has happened.
43:04
The Forest Service still, 30-some odd years later, is doing an excellent
43:09
job in managing the monument.
43:11
I haven’t heard that discussion come up subsequent to the initiation.
43:15
At the beginning was there like an argument, a discussion about well,
43:18
this monument has got to be under the Park Service because it is what
43:20
they do versus the Forest Service?
43:22
Was that a central part of what they were talking about?
43:24
Yeah, that’s basically what they were saying because it is and was an unusual
43:31
national monument in that it was set up largely for research as well as
43:36
education and recreation, but research was a big component of it and that’s very
43:41
different than other national monuments.
43:43
But, if you read the Antiquities Act under which this is established,
43:47
it allows each national monument to have different purposes and different
43:53
values, and the enabling legislation is critical for each monument.
43:59
The enabling legislation talks about research values and how to maintain them,
44:06
and it actually set up a Science Advisory Board for the early years to make sure
44:10
that the research values were maintained.
44:13
As I mentioned earlier, I was in the senator’s office, me and a geologist, and
44:19
the senator and the staff [SS interrupts]
44:21
. Which senator?
44:21
I have to look it up.
44:22
A Washington senator?
44:23
A Washington senator in Seattle.
44:25
We were standing up in his office which was way in some skyscraper [SS interrupts]
44:31
. Scoop Jackson?
44:31
It wasn’t Scoop.
44:32
It was [SS interrupts]
44:32
. Okay, because he was still in office, wasn’t he?
44:32
Yeah.
44:33
I’ll tell you a story about Scoop.
44:34
Okay.
44:36
It wasn’t Scoop.
44:37
It was the other senator.
44:38
I can’t remember.
44:39
But we could look it up.
44:42
We were standing in his office in Seattle in this skyscraper and part of
44:46
our discussion with this geologist was the fact that the fault was right off
44:51
the coast and what was going to happen to this skyscraper we were standing
44:55
in when there was an earthquake.
44:57
So, this was before it was in the popular media, Cascadia
45:01
abduction zone conversation.
45:02
Exactly.
45:05
It was pretty scary because it was a beautiful view, but we
45:08
were in this area of high risk.
45:10
The staff got out a map, and we actually drew the boundaries of what eventually
45:14
did become the national monument.
45:16
To me was important in having an ecologist in the room was that I
45:20
was able to represent the diverse interests that I had heard about.
45:23
Some of these places I had never been to, like Ape Caves.
45:26
I had never been to some of the areas that were included and were important not
45:31
only for the impact of the 1980 eruption, but from the fact that they were not
45:37
impacted, because we wanted to make sure control areas [areas where there was no
45:42
or relatively no impact] were part of the monument for scientific research.
45:47
If there hadn’t been an ecologist in the room to make that argument, I don’t
45:50
think, would have been successfully made.
45:52
For example, when I was doing soil sample outside of the blast zone with
45:57
Bob Parmenter, case in point, right?
46:00
But I think we were outside the monument.
46:01
But maybe not.
46:02
I’m not sure.
46:04
Okay, I don’t know where you were.
46:05
But there is [SS interrupts]
46:05
. It was on the eastern, it was close to the boundary, but I can’t remember exactly.
46:10
But there is the possibility of doing that research, and that’s going to
46:13
become even more important the longer we go along, because other owners are
46:18
going to be able to manage their land in whatever way they want, of course.
46:22
A key part of this monument, of course, was having agreement among the
46:27
non-Forest Service owners that they would, through exchange largely, trade
46:31
land that became in the monument for
46:37
land that
46:39
was outside.
46:40
As part of that agreement, much
46:44
of the land that had wood on it was harvested before the monument was
46:47
created and so the companies such as
46:49
Weyerhaeuser and
46:52
the State of Washington harvested the wood and actually benefited by having
46:57
land of unknown future productivity traded with land of known productivity.
47:03
It ends up that this volcanic land is growing trees very well.
47:08
Weyerhaeuser has done some initial studies, and they grow trees extremely
47:14
well on areas that were impacted.
47:16
At the time, they didn’t really know what the effect was going to be.
47:20
This trade was made, and that negotiation was really important.
47:23
But I think having boundaries that included this diversity of disturbances
47:27
and non-disturbances was also important.
47:30
I credit the many ecologists who signed these petitions and became involved in
47:35
the discussion with representing their fields very well and learning how to
47:41
communicate to the congressmen that made these decisions about the area.
47:46
What was the input or the pushback from the logging industry, Weyerhaeuser
47:52
especially, but also from the local communities in the site of the monument?
47:58
I don’t really remember there being pushback per se.
48:01
There was obviously interest in economic opportunities.
48:05
The local community saw this, from my understanding, as a
48:09
potential for recreation value.
48:11
A lot of their jobs had been washed out, and there were some recreation amenities
48:18
that were previously there that were gone, but these were mainly homeowners
48:23
and vacationers, who went up to the area.
48:26
If they could benefit from the monument, that would be good.
48:29
I think they have.
48:31
Weyerhaeuser was concerned with retaining productive land,
48:35
and I think they benefited.
48:38
I think it ended up being a win-win all around.
48:41
That’s what we wanted to argue, and I think the scientists greatly benefited
48:45
by having an area where they could perform these long-term research
48:50
activities with some understanding that they would be somewhat protected.
48:56
They’re not protected in the sense that there’s a fence around it and
48:58
people can’t go there, but some of the activities are restricted that
49:04
would harm research activities.
49:09
I think it’s been good for everyone in many ways.
49:12
How would you characterize
49:15
the general shape but also some of the details of the management
49:19
plan and how it was implemented initially and maybe how it’s evolved?
49:25
Gosh.
49:28
The general shape, as I’ve said, was to incorporate the variety of
49:32
disturbances in the areas and to reach out, like it reaches out along the
49:38
debris avalanche, and it follows areas that were very close to ownerships
49:44
that would allow productive lands that would occur versus
49:47
those of unknown productivity.
49:53
It’s not just a regular circle or square.
49:55
It has all these odd little ins and outs that were related to particular
49:59
components of the landscape.
50:01
I think that is probably unusual.
50:04
When you see other monuments, they have more of a regular shape.
50:07
That’s partly because they’ve been set up where you didn’t understand the land
50:10
so well, and we spent a lot of time out there on the ground understanding the
50:14
land in the time period since the eruption to when the monument was laid out.
50:19
I think it’s been a very useful configuration
50:24
over time.
50:25
I think it’s worked very well.
50:28
There’s not a lot of recreation that has gone on in the area that you
50:34
have specialized in, in terms of the debris avalanche deposit area.
50:38
Is that correct, or?
50:40
There is, actually, in some sense because the road that has now been established
50:46
that goes up to Johnston Ridge is right along the debris avalanche deposit.
50:49
You’re talking about up on the high ridge that looks down into the valley?
50:52
The high ridge.
50:53
Right.
50:53
So, when most people drive in, they are looking at the debris avalanche deposit.
50:58
That part is probably seen more than any other area because the eastern side
51:04
of the mountain is not as accessible.
51:07
When people come into the area, the prime access from the larger cities—Seattle,
51:11
Olympia, Portland—is along the I-5 corridor, and if they take the road up
51:16
to the Johnston Ridge, they will see the debris avalanche deposit and then the
51:20
hiking trail, the Hummocks Trail, is on the debris avalanche deposit as well.
51:26
It’s about 2.5 miles, a little bit less than that, and people can experience
51:31
what it actually is [like] on the debris avalanche deposit and then when
51:36
you go to Coldwater Lake, which is right there along the road, too, which
51:41
was created by the debris avalanche deposit, you can see the floating logs.
51:48
You can be a part of that environment, and that is where many people
51:52
stop to picnic, swim, and boat.
51:56
People do go to that part of it.
51:58
My point is, though, beyond that, but in terms of across the expanse
52:03
of the deposit, do they generally stay close to the road so the study
52:08
areas that more or less have stayed intact without a lot of disturbance
52:12
from human meddling, shall we say?
52:14
Yeah, that is true.
52:16
There’s not very much impact.
52:18
What we did find was that when the logging was occurring on the slopes
52:22
there was a bulldozer that went through one of our plots that was holding
52:27
one of the chains down that they used for logging when they pulled the
52:35
logs upslope.
52:37
We saw those tracks immediately and could see them for several years afterwards,
52:41
but we did not find any long-term impact, because it was very early on.
52:45
I think it was in 1981, before there was any
52:49
recovery, per se.
52:51
We didn’t see any long-term impacts, but we have seen horses out there
52:57
with people riding their horses.
52:59
That’s supposed to not happen?
53:00
That can happen.
53:01
But they’re not supposed to?
53:03
I think—I don’t know what the rules are on that.
53:05
I have to look.
53:07
I found somebody’s credit card in one of our plots one year!
53:12
That wasn’t supposed to happen.
53:13
Peter Frenzen was very interested in that.
53:15
But the other way [SS interrupts]
53:16
. The credit card, what were they going to try to buy out there?
53:20
I don’t know!
53:21
So occasionally people do get out there.
53:23
But you are correct in that very rarely do people get out there.
53:27
I should say that the helicopter rides people pay for go directly
53:33
over the debris avalanche deposit.
53:35
People fly up and down that area quite a bit.
53:40
They come out of Toutle, don’t they?
53:41
They come out of; I think it’s Studebaker
53:44
Ridge?
53:44
Right along the road, there’s a place where you can pay $100 or so per person
53:49
and can get a 15-minute ride, which mainly takes you over the debris avalanche
53:54
deposit, or you can take a longer ride that will take you up to the crater.
53:57
All those people see the debris avalanche deposit.
54:01
A funny story is one of the news people was flying in his helicopter and he
54:07
said, “I see all of the signs,” is what he called them, “that are up.” They
54:13
were about 1 m high, about a quarter meter across, a quarter meter deep, he
54:17
said, and they were placed regularly along the debris avalanche deposit.
54:21
He said, are those for sale signs?
54:25
Of course, those were our seed traps.
54:26
Reference to the credit card.
54:27
They were our seed traps.
54:30
Yeah!
54:31
You see that’s the credit.
54:31
It happened when somebody saw that and they tried to,
54:33
anyway—humor for the record.
54:33
Why not?
54:34
I don’t know.
54:35
The credit card was much later.
54:36
But anyway, the people’s thinking was weird.
54:40
You asked about Scoop Jackson.
54:42
Yes, tell me a story about Scoop.
54:43
I have to tell you about Scoop.
54:45
Scoop was on one of the committees that we
54:51
testified before when I was in Washington.
54:55
He asked this great question to the head of USGS who had lived in
55:02
Washington, had heard about St. Helens, had all these reports, and had staff
55:06
people standing in the background.
55:08
Scoop asked, “I’ve heard that there is a guy named Harry Truman who lives out
55:14
there and that there are others that own property and if we make this a monument
55:19
what is it going to do to Harry Truman and his property and his friends’ property?”
55:26
The head of USGS said,
55:29
“I’m not sure.” Then had this little conference with people at the table,
55:34
again, who were Washingtonians [DC people] that didn’t really know, and
55:37
they finally answered something like, I don’t think any of that is there anymore.
55:43
Rumor has it that Harry may not be with us anymore.
55:47
Right.
55:48
He’s under 500 m of whatever.
55:52
Right, I mean, obviously, all of that is gone.
55:54
But that was pretty funny because this is how Washington works.
55:57
You have the head people who don’t really know the on-the-ground situation.
56:01
That’s why I was thrilled that I was able to go to Washington
56:04
and be a part of this debate.
56:06
Another really great commentary: there was a senator from Ohio who
56:13
was chair of the House committee and wanted to be very supportive.
56:19
There is a very famous ecologist from Ohio who had done a lot of
56:22
good work on succession and this senator, this congressman, was
56:27
aware of that and he wanted to be supportive in understanding succession.
56:31
He said it’s really important that we set this area aside and learn
56:34
how to understand succession, as Ohio scientists have found that this
56:39
can actually be beautiful brown and that brown is something we learn a
56:43
lot from until it turns to green.
56:46
You’ve been out there, and it’s not brown.
56:49
It’s not brown at all.
56:50
When I testified, his aide [said] , “Well, you’re right. These concepts are really
56:54
important, but it’s gorgeous gray.
56:56
It’s not brown.” It’s the mountain tumbled down and the ash.
57:01
Everything’s gray.
57:03
It’s not brown.
57:04
I talk about the gorgeous gray a lot.
57:07
That’s not beautiful brown.
57:09
It’s mainly one of the differences when you think about succession
57:11
in the eastern United States compared to Mount St. Helens.
57:16
In the East it largely is soil that is turned over that is brown, but Mount
57:21
St. Helens is a mountain, which is gray.
57:25
Speaking of the absurd and the misunderstanding, my thought before
57:32
you actually went into the story about Jackson and ownership was did
57:36
anybody ever ask a question about the ownership of the top of the mountain?
57:41
Oh yes.
57:41
The railroad that who the heck knows where it is, right?
57:45
The railroad company graciously said, well, we own the entire earth because
57:51
the ash had gone around the earth.
57:52
They were jokingly saying they owned everything.
57:58
Unfortunately, having been a historian of gilded age politics in
58:02
the railroad robber barons, I find some humor, but some alarm in that.
58:08
But they were very, the owners of the mountain, were very
58:12
gracious because, obviously, there was no value in owning that.
58:16
What was interesting to me was that historically there
58:20
had been discussion of having
58:24
thermal energy provided from the top of the mountain and putting
58:27
shafts down at one time, which obviously would have been long gone.
58:32
Oh yeah, absolutely.
58:33
It wouldn’t have been a good idea with the eruption, and now as we
58:38
move toward geothermal, people are aware of those possibilities and
58:43
certainly take care when needed.
58:45
You talked about funding and continuity in National Geographic and Earthwatch,
58:51
how has that dynamic changed let’s say after that first 15, 20 years?
58:55
Has it kind of continued patch-wise since that time?
58:57
Or has the NSF come and stepped in again more?
59:00
There are some individuals that are funded by NSF.
59:04
As I said, the Forest Service has been great about providing a lot
59:07
of logistic support and pretty much everything that I’ve asked for.
59:13
The laboratory that I work for has provided some support, but my
59:17
lab is largely dealing with energy issues, and so it’s hard for me to
59:20
justify the Mount St. Helens work.
59:23
I end up taking vacation to do a lot of this work.
59:27
I have found the amount of time I take to do vacation would be the same
59:32
amount of time to write a proposal.
59:34
I know that one of the proposals I wrote to the National Geographic was funded, but
59:39
I did it through the laboratory and then the laboratory wouldn’t accept it, because
59:44
of the rules that National Geographic had.
59:46
I also have a position at the University of Tennessee, and I should
59:50
write these proposals through the University of Tennessee, which is
59:52
probably what I’ll do in the future.
59:55
After that lesson when it was kind of disconcerting.
59:58
Go Vols.
1:00:00
This is Oregon State.
1:00:01
Okay.
1:00:02
We’re a little different color orange.
1:00:05
But yeah, go Vols.
1:00:09
It’s challenging to continue long-term studies.
1:00:14
It’s easier to get funding for efforts to go out there and do the work than for
1:00:19
the record keeping and all the amount of work that is taken to do the record
1:00:24
keeping and do the statistical analysis.
1:00:28
That part, getting out there is easy to fund, but the details of real
1:00:35
research, I don’t know what the number is, but you have 2-3 hours more work
1:00:41
in your office once you get back compared to what you do in the field.
1:00:45
That part is really hard, and it takes a lot of dedication by the people involved.
1:00:48
Because you have to do something with what the time you did out there.
1:00:50
Right.
1:00:51
I think having these volunteers in the field is terrific and allows
1:00:55
the field work to happen, but it’s only my literal blood, sweat, and
1:01:01
tears that have enabled a lot of the analysis to happen, and I think that
1:01:04
situation is true for some others.
1:01:06
Now, referencing the IBP [International Biological Program] , LTER [Long-Term
1:01:09
Ecological Research] type dynamic and specifically some of the H.J. Andrews
1:01:12
people that came up there at the beginning, and specially I’m talking
1:01:15
about Jerry Franklin and Fred Swanson and then Jim Sedell [he’s no longer
1:01:19
with us], but how would you characterize the importance of what they brought to
1:01:24
the table at the beginning and also in carrying this thing through 35 years now?
1:01:29
I’ll answer this very broadly.
1:01:32
The International Biological Program [IBP], was a large program that looked
1:01:37
at synthesizing large areas of research.
1:01:40
Actually, my initial work at Oak Ridge National Laboratories as
1:01:44
a student was funded under IBP.
1:01:47
I and then others like you mentioned obtained a broad-scale perspective.
1:01:52
It was interesting to me, because when I went to University of Washington,
1:01:55
where I did my graduate work, that perspective was not so pervasive.
1:02:00
It was more an evolutionary perspective.
1:02:02
Getting involved with St. Helens early on and those who had this IBP perspective
1:02:08
and that regional perspective again kind of brought me back to my roots.
1:02:12
It was very important in the initial discussions about how can we sample this
1:02:19
area in a way that we have consistency across the difference disturbance types
1:02:24
and the ability to determine impacts over long-term in the future were really
1:02:30
important in deciding this 250 m2 sampling [plot] regime that all of us set up, I
1:02:36
think was really important and benefited from having that broad-scale long-term
1:02:41
perspective, such as IBP provided.
1:02:46
What about the personalities, like Jerry Franklin and Fred Swanson?
1:02:50
Yeah, well that was fun.
1:02:53
Jerry is a great person to work with, and I felt so
1:03:00
interested to be able to be involved with him and with others.
1:03:05
Jerry is a great leader and a very enthusiastic scientist and quickly engaged
1:03:12
everyone in a very productive way that I think was really profitable to everyone.
1:03:19
It was profitable in the sense that he was very inclusive in having people involved.
1:03:24
Me, I was the young kid on the block.
1:03:27
I was
1:03:29
a decade or two younger than almost everybody on the team, but I had the
1:03:33
time available to do this work because everybody else had existing commitments.
1:03:37
I felt very lucky to be involved in this and I don’t’ think that would
1:03:41
have happened if someone like Jerry, who still recognizes youth and the
1:03:47
abilities that are there, to be engaged.
1:03:52
That was great.
1:03:53
He told me that the Pulse idea actually came first where
1:03:59
he developed in the Sierras.
1:04:01
Correct.
1:04:02
They did a couple of trips to Sequoia, Suwanee, and Crescent Creek and then the
1:04:07
mountain blew up and I guess it was time to test it on a bigger scale, perhaps?
1:04:12
Right.
1:04:13
So, the Pulse concept had already been established.
1:04:14
When he first proposed a Pulse and so forth everyone, they kind of
1:04:18
knew logistically how to do this.
1:04:20
Of course, they didn’t envision it was going to be so big and so
1:04:23
long, but that has been valuable.
1:04:30
What do you know about the salvage logging dynamic in the early years
1:04:34
and did it have anything to do or affect anything to do with your
1:04:36
research, directly or indirectly?
1:04:39
Okay.
1:04:39
So, there weren’t logs on the debris avalanche deposit, because it was
1:04:43
all buried by the mountain itself.
1:04:46
But the roads that were open for logging were how we got to our sites.
1:04:52
Having
1:04:54
those roads available and having maps of those roads, because we had to go through
1:04:59
this maze of logging roads to figure out where we were going to go, was important.
1:05:03
Of course, the hazard was all these fully loaded logging trucks coming out
1:05:08
that were really dangerous, because many of the roads were single pass
1:05:15
[lane] and when they were coming up from roads that went down toward the
1:05:19
debris avalanche fully loaded, they would often be pulled by a bulldozer.
1:05:25
A logging truck pulled by a bulldozer going up a steep slope cannot stop.
1:05:30
If they stop, they cannot get started again.
1:05:33
There are dozens of switchbacks and they cannot stop.
1:05:40
We would have radios with us, and the radios would tell us there’s a
1:05:43
truck coming up, pull off the road.
1:05:46
But there weren’t always pull offs.
1:05:48
We’d be driving, the question is do you drive frantically and fast as you can
1:05:52
down to find a pull out and then get closer to that logging truck or whatever.
1:05:57
We never were run off the road, but I think they would have run us off the
1:06:01
road, which would have been disastrous,
1:06:06
but anyway.
1:06:06
Didn’t one or two get pretty seriously injured at some time?
1:06:10
I don’t know of anybody being injured at St. Helens, but I have had a
1:06:15
good friend killed by a logging truck who was a graduate student
1:06:18
at the University of Washington.
1:06:21
Up in the Cascades?
1:06:21
Up in the Cascades.
1:06:23
Yeah.
1:06:25
The logging trucks are very dangerous and when you’re in a small vehicle,
1:06:31
it’s pitted against you.
1:06:32
I also remember taking a class down to the east side of the mountain to
1:06:38
look at the effects of the volcano,
1:06:43
and
1:06:48
they were more interested in the salvage logging operation.
1:06:52
[It’s 12:23.] They were less interested in the effects of the
1:06:58
volcano, because helicopter logging was being done and is amazing.
1:07:02
They wanted to look at the helicopter logging versus the effects of the
1:07:06
volcano, because it was fascinating.
1:07:09
We benefited and Weyerhaeuser has been very supportive over the years.
1:07:14
I need to give them a lot of credit by allowing us to go on these roads
1:07:18
where they were pretty much off-limits, except to Weyerhaeuser vehicles.
1:07:23
The Department of Natural Resources provided us with radios that
1:07:26
were required to go back there.
1:07:28
We got a lot of different kinds of support.
1:07:30
That was kind of different from everything that was going on on the east side where
1:07:34
the Forest Service was providing support.
1:07:36
We got more support from those two groups because that’s where they were active.
1:07:43
How would you characterize the cultural place of Mount St. Helens?
1:07:49
You’re a scientist but, obviously, you have a lot of experience with this place.
1:07:53
It’s a powerful place in your personal history.
1:07:57
How would you put it as a cultural phenomenon?
1:08:00
It’s interesting.
1:08:01
Often when I talk, I used to say,“Remember when Mount St. Helens erupted,” and
1:08:06
you will know where you were then, and everyone would say oh yeah, I
1:08:10
was doing this, or I was doing that. Everyone would know. But now you
1:08:14
have to be younger than 40, pretty much, to remember that and as our
1:08:20
population’s gotten older [SS interrupts]
1:08:21
. You mean older than 40.
1:08:22
Older than 40, yeah.
1:08:24
Older to 40 to know that, in fact, someone who joined us on our field
1:08:29
work this summer when they heard they were going to Mount St. Helens,
1:08:32
they said, oh, but I thought that blew up, implying and was gone.
1:08:40
Some people don’t think of it as phenomena right now,
1:08:47
but people are always interested in it.
1:08:50
One thing, I was going to show you this picture that I always do,
1:08:55
let’s see if I can get it here.
1:08:56
Are we back to that same picture of the debris avalanche again?
1:08:58
Yeah, but this is, I’m going to move down.
1:09:01
One thing I always do every year
1:09:05
is I have a volcano cake.
1:09:09
These are some of my recent volcano cakes.
1:09:11
And those are strawberries?
1:09:13
Yeah.
1:09:16
This is my way of conveying what has happened with Mount St. Helens.
1:09:20
We try to make these as accurate as possible.
1:09:23
We start with a layer of a strawberry cake, which is the magma.
1:09:28
Then we have a chocolate cake, which is the soil and the dirt.
1:09:32
Then I create a bunt cake that I pull apart, which is
1:09:35
the debris avalanche deposit.
1:09:38
Because strawberries are so good to eat, we put a bunch of strawberries
1:09:41
in the cake, which is the lava which really doesn’t exist much of.
1:09:46
We artificially do that.
1:09:48
But we have the pretzels, which are the blowdown forest.
1:09:53
We have a few volcanic bombs, which are chocolate covered raisins.
1:09:58
We have now the vegetation coming back, which are usually herbs that
1:10:04
represent the recovery, and we have the glaciers on top [white icing].
1:10:07
In some years I’ll put dry ice in it to represent the steam.
1:10:13
When I’ve taken this to a fifth-grade class, the teacher said to me, “I’ve never
1:10:18
seen students so interested in looking at the cake rather than eating it.” But
1:10:26
it’s really a cool way to get people involved in the phenomena [SS interrupts]
1:10:30
. Have you ever taken this to a conference or a group of science people
1:10:34
to get their perspective on this?
1:10:36
Well, I’m going to show this this week.
1:10:39
I think it’s great.
1:10:39
It’s fantastic.
1:10:39
Yeah.
1:10:42
It depends on wherever I am on May 18th as to where I do it.
1:10:45
Okay, every year on.
1:10:46
I do it at May 18th at 8:32, which in eastern time is 11:32.
1:10:51
I always have it at 8:32 Pacific Daylight Time.
1:10:53
Do you ever have like a moment of silence or anything just to
1:10:55
kind of think about that moment?
1:10:57
Well, we talk about the moment.
1:10:59
Before we eat the cake, we always have a discussion of what this is, depending
1:11:03
on where I am, as to how it happens.
1:11:08
As I said, I’ve taken it into schools quite a bit and it’s a really good
1:11:11
way to get the kids to talk about the different disturbances, the different
1:11:15
vegetation coming back because these kids don’t remember it now.
1:11:20
They were not born, and they don’t understand what volcanoes are.
1:11:26
The offshoot of this when my granddaughter, who’s 2,
1:11:29
heard that I was a volcano
1:11:33
ecologist she immediately thought that means you get to bake cakes all the time,
1:11:39
which didn’t occur to me.
1:11:41
Anyway, what I find is people think of it in different ways that
1:11:47
you don’t anticipate right now.
1:11:50
One interesting cultural phenomena, I was invited to
1:11:55
Princeton to the Theoretical Physics Laboratory to talk about Mount St.
1:11:59
Helens because all these physicists were interested in phenomena that have
1:12:04
shaped the science of this generation.
1:12:07
I went just because I thought it was so interesting that these physicists
1:12:12
were interested in the ecological recovery of Mount St. Helens.
1:12:16
What I found that we have in common that we talked about quite a bit was scale.
1:12:22
The scale of research and the scale of phenomena and this is
1:12:27
definitely a big issue at St. Helens.
1:12:28
How do you measure what happens on a very small scale that has
1:12:33
implications for a very large scale?
1:12:35
You can look at geologic time.
1:12:38
They are all components of it.
1:12:40
Across science this issue of scale really pervades.
1:12:44
I think that’s true in cultural circles as well.
1:12:48
If it hasn’t occurred in your lifetime, if you don’t remember it, it has a
1:12:52
different kind of [SS interrupts]
1:12:53
. It hasn’t occurred.
1:12:54
It just means something different to you.
1:12:57
People think of Vesuvius, and they know the story of what happened at Mt.
1:13:01
Vesuvius in terms of what they’ve read about or the pictures they’ve seen
1:13:05
in places like National Geographic.
1:13:07
Maybe for this younger generation St. Helens is becoming this same way.
1:13:11
I think having people who were there talk about it and can convey the
1:13:16
stories gives a different perception to something that may be out of
1:13:21
the human scale of their lives.
1:13:23
I still remember the movie, and I think there was a book: Krakatoa, East of Java.
1:13:29
That was the first big volcano thing that I remember in literature when I was small.
1:13:33
It made an impression of me.
1:13:35
The whole island disappearing.
1:13:37
A much more violent eruption even than St. Helens, which is kind of hard to believe.
1:13:41
Yeah.
1:13:43
The way it’s first conveyed to people I think is important and
1:13:48
that it’s not just a geology event.
1:13:51
I find sometimes when I talk to people, they ask a lot of geology stories
1:13:55
and I think bringing in the ecology and the potential for succession.
1:14:00
Change is what the story of Mount St. Helens to me is really about, not just
1:14:05
geologic change but ecologic change.
1:14:08
The human story has changed there and getting the acceptance of change
1:14:13
as part of our understanding of the world I think is very important.
1:14:19
This is a good way to introduce that concept to people.
1:14:21
I think it’s more impactful and I think it’s natural for people to
1:14:26
be impressed by catastrophic events versus slow succession processes.
1:14:32
Absolutely.
1:14:34
I think it’s a natural reaction.
1:14:37
Anyway, how would you best synopsize your history and role of Mount St. Helens?
1:14:45
My history?
1:14:46
How would you best synopsize your role in the science at Mount St. Helens?
1:14:51
My role?
1:14:52
Not just in the debris avalanche deposit but general.
1:14:55
I mean, you’ve been part of the publications, the editorial, the Pulse,
1:15:00
but also your specific study area.
1:15:03
Part of it is my specific study area, because no one else had any interest
1:15:06
in the debris avalanche deposit.
1:15:09
To me, that’s so different from everything else we hear about.
1:15:13
Even on the Pulse trip when people talk about all the phenomena on the
1:15:19
east side of the mountain, and I realize how different it is on the
1:15:23
west side where the debris avalanche deposit and also on the mud flows
1:15:26
that you hear a little bit more about.
1:15:28
I think understanding of this massive burial that occurred is really different,
1:15:34
and again provides a story that there were different disturbances and there
1:15:40
were different recovery patterns.
1:15:42
That’s part of, not only the Mount St. Helens event, but also the
1:15:50
different kinds of disturbances.
1:15:51
They always are different impacts, different recovery patterns.
1:15:56
I think besides all the work we’ve done on the debris avalanche,
1:16:00
pulling together the book.
1:16:02
The 25-year anniversary book and the upcoming 35-year anniversary
1:16:07
book is really important because to me that’s what’s going to stand
1:16:11
the test of time of the synthesis.
1:16:15
I’ve produced several other books with Springer and have
1:16:18
a lot of experience in books.
1:16:21
I know how to do those.
1:16:22
I’ve been an editor of the journal Environmental Management for about
1:16:26
13 years, but finally gave that up.
1:16:28
But I know how to pull together an edited volume and initially contacted Springer,
1:16:37
got the contract worked out, and I’ve
1:16:42
had discussions with a lot of other publishers and knew that Springer was
1:16:46
going to be able to do a good job with us.
1:16:49
That activity, in my mind, is going to really stand the test of
1:16:53
time of pulling things together.
1:16:55
In talking to one of the students at the Pulse, I was referring to the book
1:16:59
and he said, what are you talking about?
1:17:01
And then he said, oh the Bible.
1:17:04
Which is a little, right, ridiculous.
1:17:08
But still, I think for allowing young people to come in and understand
1:17:13
what is going on to me that’s a place they can go to and I think the 35th
1:17:18
anniversary book, which pulls in other studies that aren’t covered in the
1:17:22
initial volume, is going to be really important for capturing the story.
1:17:28
The paper we had in Science that covered the 25-year recovery, again, brought it
1:17:34
back to people’s minds that this wasn’t just a one-term event and that this is
1:17:40
the most ecologically studied volcano in the world and in terms of successional
1:17:48
stories it really is a part of the story.
1:17:52
I am contacted
1:17:55
sometimes by people writing ecology text, by people covering more synthesis
1:18:00
activities about succession that what is the role of Mount St. Helens.
1:18:06
For instance, there was an Encyclopedia of Ecology, and they asked me to write the
1:18:13
entries on succession and disturbance.
1:18:16
I was glad to do that because I knew from my experience, I would
1:18:19
tell the story a little different than someone who had worked in other
1:18:23
kinds of successional processes.
1:18:26
I hope the impact that we have at St. Helens is broader because of these kinds
1:18:32
of activities I think we’ve learned so much and that needs to be part of the
1:18:37
successional and disturbance lexicon.
1:18:39
In your view, what’s the most important scientific lesson or
1:18:42
lessons learned at Mount St. Helens?
1:18:46
Diversity.
1:18:47
The diversity of disturbances, the diversity of recovery, and the
1:18:50
importance of the particulars of this event: the timing of the event.
1:18:56
8:32 on May 18th made a huge difference in the impact and in the
1:19:02
recovery processes that occurred.
1:19:04
If it had been in the afternoon on another day of the week in
1:19:09
another season, it would have been a very different kind of event.
1:19:15
Then the components of succession that we have learned about are really different
1:19:21
than what we have learned otherwise.
1:19:24
So,
1:19:29
in the earlier volume, and it’s now being updated a little bit,
1:19:32
we have a successional diagram that we’ve developed of what the
1:19:36
key components of succession are.
1:19:39
I’ve highlighted in what you’re looking at in yellow what we’ve really
1:19:43
learned from research at St. Helens.
1:19:45
Not that other research hasn’t contributed to these.
1:19:49
When I look at this the importance about survivors, the importance about
1:19:52
survivor mortality—just because you survive the initial disturbance doesn’t
1:19:56
mean you’re going to make it later
1:19:58
—the importance of habitats being created, the importance of the landscape
1:20:03
being able to accept new organisms that come in that weren’t there,
1:20:07
local conditions, and then subsequent disturbances and management that can occur
1:20:13
on all these areas is really critical.
1:20:15
These were not so much a part of what you would have drawn out in
1:20:19
successional diagrams prior to 1980.
1:20:23
We learned some of these lessons early on, but they’re really
1:20:26
being enforced again and again.
1:20:28
I put management in big letters and kind of across the whole diagram because it
1:20:32
hits so many different parts of the story.
1:20:36
I hope that some of these words are now part of what freshman ecologists learn,
1:20:44
but they aren’t always, unfortunately.
1:20:46
Well, scientific revolutions take place in different ways over different
1:20:51
timescales and have different pushbacks or shall we say lag effects?
1:20:56
That’s right.
1:20:57
That’s right.
1:20:57
So, it’s important like this talk that I’m able to give tomorrow is
1:21:01
a discussion on long-term studies.
1:21:05
Being part of those discussions and what we can learn from those and how they
1:21:10
can impact other work, like you talked about the long-term ecological program,
1:21:15
ecological research LTERs, that are often done in very controlled environment.
1:21:22
The disadvantage of St. Helens not being part of an LTER is we
1:21:26
don’t have continuing funding for some of these kind of activities,
1:21:30
whereas there should be, I think.
1:21:32
Because we’ve learned so much and, if we continue this work into
1:21:35
the future, we could learn who knows what more, but we would.
1:21:39
Along that, and this will be the last question, what is some of the
1:21:42
work or research that you think remains undone at Mount St. Helens?
1:21:46
Well, soils are a big part of the story.
1:21:50
Particularly on the debris avalanche, I think the soil changes that are
1:21:55
really important to the vegetation changes is really critical and
1:22:01
we haven’t done enough of that.
1:22:04
In my area, we haven’t done hardly any of it.
1:22:06
It’s been really hard to get the soils people to be engaged.
1:22:09
I know when I finished my Ph.D. a professor at the University of Washington
1:22:14
said, “Well, now, you can do a Ph.D. in soils and learn what’s really important.”
1:22:18
Needless to say, that is not what I did. Once you finish one Ph.D., you’re
1:22:23
not enthusiastic about doing another.
1:22:26
One Ph.D. is quite enough for most people.
1:22:28
For me, for sure.
1:22:31
As a systems ecologist, I would have liked to had more systems work
1:22:36
that looked across the comparisons.
1:22:38
Hopefully that will happen in the future.
1:22:40
There’s no reason why it can’t happen, particularly in places where we
1:22:44
retain this 250 m2 plot sampling that allows us to do that kind of analysis.
1:22:51
I’m trained as a mathematical ecologist, and one of the reasons I got into this
1:22:56
was because when you look at mathematical models of succession of trees the first
1:23:03
30 stages are pretty much just guesswork.
1:23:06
I was hoping to really be able to do a better job of modeling, but what we’ve
1:23:11
learned hasn’t helped much because so many of the phenomena are random,
1:23:16
and maybe that’s what the story is.
1:23:18
Maybe we need to be more random in the models than putting in
1:23:21
early successional species first.
1:23:24
But I haven’t revisited that part either of being able to model and predict what
1:23:29
can happen under successional dynamics.
1:23:32
I think that’s another story that could be and should be revisited.
1:23:36
Virginia, thank you very much.
1:23:38
Oh, well, thank you.
1:23:40
That was a great two-session interview, and I look forward
1:23:44
to hearing your talk tomorrow.
1:23:45
Okay, and I’ll try to send [recording cuts off]
