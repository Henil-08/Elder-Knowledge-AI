00:02
Before we begin, I want to offer a brief summary as to why we are here today.
00:07
As you know, there is currently a vibrant collection of oral histories
00:11
in the Oregon State University Special Collections and Archives Research
00:16
Center titled, "Voices of the Forest, Voices of the Mills." That collection
00:20
consists of stories on people's personal backgrounds and how their journeys
00:25
have led them to the Andrews Forest.
00:26
It also consists of stories that illustrate certain political and
00:30
cultural transitions throughout their time working at the Andrews Forest.
00:35
Today we are here to build from that by asking more direct questions
00:39
about your personal philosophy and practice of science and then scale
00:43
up to the philosophy and practice and science on the community level.
00:47
The interview will inform the writing of my master's thesis where my
00:53
research question asks 1] what are the different traditions of science that
00:56
characterize the Andrews community and 2] what are the philosophies of
00:59
nature that underlie these traditions.
01:00
I would like
01:19
to ask you a few open-ended questions regarding these topics and we expect
01:23
the duration of the interview to be one to two hours to complete, depending
01:28
on your interest and knowledge.
01:30
Would you like to participate in this interview?
01:33
Yes.
01:35
Great, so we can end the interview at any point that you wish to do so.
01:40
Please inform me right away, if you no longer want to participate
01:44
in the interview and the interview will immediately end.
01:46
Do I have permission to record the interview?
01:50
Not going to happen.
01:51
[will not ask to end the interview]
01:51
Okay.
01:54
This interview will be deposited with the Oregon State University Library's
01:59
Special Collections and Archives Research Center for preservation and access.
02:05
SCARC's commitment to open access include the release of contextualized
02:09
interview content online.
02:11
Are you willing for this interview and its derivatives, including a
02:14
transcript and an interview abstract, to be made available online?
02:18
Yes.
02:19
Okay, great.
02:22
Alright, now we can begin with the questions.
02:26
As
02:28
I briefly mentioned, the first set of questions touch on your
02:32
personal perception of nature and your personal philosophy
02:36
and take on scientific research.
02:40
My first question that I would like to ask you is how would you define an ecosystem?
02:46
How would I define what?
02:47
An ecosystem.
02:48
A forest ecosystem.
02:52
That's pretty straightforward.
02:53
An ecosystem is basically
02:57
a unit of some type that incorporates all of the biota and their
03:05
interactions and the environment in which they are operating.
03:11
It includes all aspects, environmental and biological, of the system.
03:20
And how would you characterize the nature of an ecosystem?
03:24
Is it static?
03:26
Is it dynamic?
03:27
Orderly?
03:28
Chaotic?
03:30
Well, I'm going to just focus on how I characterize a forest ecosystem.
03:38
Basically, when I talk to people about ecosystems, I talk about ecosystems
03:45
as having three major attributes, particularly forest ecosystems do.
03:51
One of them is the biological diversity.
03:57
I used to call it composition, but that's too narrow a consideration.
04:04
One of the attributes of a forest ecosystem is the biota and the
04:09
interacting elements among the biota, the relationships among the
04:14
biota, the food webs, for example.
04:17
So, it has organisms and interactions among those organisms.
04:24
Secondly, it has structure and in the case of forests, as with coral reefs,
04:31
it has a very physical structure.
04:34
I liken it to architecture and
04:41
the structure includes different pieces of the ecosystem, different
04:46
parts of the ecosystem, such as the tree, the snag, the down log.
04:53
It also, structure also involves the way that those pieces are arranged spatially.
05:00
It has to do with whether or not there's uniformity or heterogeneity, and so forth.
05:08
It has biota, it has structure, and finally it has functions that it performs.
05:17
All ecosystems
05:20
are working ecosystems.
05:22
All forests are working forests in that they are carrying out functions
05:27
which are important to life on earth and to us as human beings.
05:40
I categorize the functions really classically.
05:45
There are three categories.
05:48
One has to do with production.
05:50
Capture the sun's energy through the process of photosynthesis and then
05:59
the distribution and utilization of those energy-rich carbon compounds
06:04
that are produced by the green plants.
06:08
Production is very, very broad.
06:11
It has to do with carbon or energy or biomass and it's all interchangeable.
06:19
You can use many currency you want.
06:21
Second category is the interaction, the interrelationship of the
06:25
forest to the hydrologic flows.
06:29
I don't really call them cycles because at the level of forest it
06:34
has to do with flows of material in and through the forest.
06:42
The forest plays very important roles in interacting with the precipitation
06:51
with the water that's provided in the system and moves through it.
06:58
The third major category is the forest ecosystem's
07:04
role in conserving nutrients and influencing
07:12
geomorphic processes, such as erosion and deposition of materials.
07:17
Most ecosystem scientists tend to think of it in terms of nutrients.
07:22
I think of it as all the material cycles and relationships, except
07:28
water which I separated out.
07:32
Then a fourth category is work, or functions, performed by an
07:39
ecosystem is providing habitat for biological diversity.
07:44
So, providing the place in which they live and inhabit and feed and are fed upon.
07:59
An
08:01
ecosystem then has composition, structure, and function and the functions include
08:06
the production function, which is carbon or energy, water cycle [material
08:15
and nutrient cycles], and habitat.
08:18
That's how I think about an ecosystem.
08:24
It is a vision that I developed over probably about a 40-year period.
08:34
Is there anything about a forest ecosystem that you think makes it
08:37
particularly-what about a forest ecosystem makes it particularly
08:41
special or different from all others?
08:44
Well, I think you know
08:50
what makes an ecosystem special?
08:53
Forests, specifically, from other ecosystems.
08:57
Oh, it's the importance of the work that it does.
09:01
It's the scale at which it is doing these things.
09:06
That's what makes it particularly important.
09:13
One could argue other ecosystems are equally important, too,
09:16
but it just so happens that my focus is on trees and forests.
09:28
Then, with that four parts of the ecosystem that you described,
09:33
would you say that the forest has order or is it chaotic?
09:36
Or both?
09:37
Oh, the forest definitely has order.
09:39
It definitely has pattern and you know there are certainly aspects of
09:51
ecosystems and what happens to them that are random or somewhat chaotic,
09:55
but fundamentally it's in the nature of them to have higher probabilities
10:05
of certain outcomes than others.
10:09
So, no, I consider it to be a well-ordered system, a system about
10:15
which you can make predictions.
10:23
Then, what is your theoretical or philosophical background and how is
10:27
that applied toward your science?
10:31
What is my philosophical background?
10:33
I never had a course in philosophy.
10:37
So,
10:41
I grew up
10:47
interacting with forests.
10:49
I was very slow as a child to socialize.
10:56
There were reasons for that, but the forest became the
11:00
place where I was comfortable.
11:06
My relationship with forests has always been a personal one.
11:14
It had to do with,
11:19
well, I guess in a sense it had to do with comfort.
11:22
It was a place where I was comfortable, and I determined very early in my life
11:30
that I really wanted to work with forests.
11:34
When I was 14, I made the decision and I made it out loud, just to myself
11:42
and to the forest, that I wanted to do whatever I could for trees and forests
11:48
in a world dominated by human beings.
11:51
That's my mission.
11:54
There's some philosophical element [in that] . One of them
12:11
is that probably the best way I could do things initially was to
12:16
learn more about the forest and to share that with other people.
12:21
That's what I had an opportunity to do and it became very clear
12:27
that that was a very good way for me to carry forward my mission.
12:39
How about your disciplinary roots?
12:41
How has your training as an academic influenced the development
12:46
of your style of science?
12:49
Well,
12:52
I don't really know.
13:05
I didn't ever expect to be an academician.
13:08
I had no ambition to be an academician.
13:11
I was somewhat
13:16
contemptuous of academics.
13:19
To a certain extent, I still am.
13:29
I think you know I had teachers that profoundly influenced me
13:36
in terms of what to do and
13:44
how to talk about what I was doing.
13:47
I think individuals.
13:48
But
13:51
I've always fallen between traditional academic groups.
13:58
For example, I've got two degrees: one in forestry and one in
14:04
botany, or ecology, if you would.
14:07
Neither group views me as one of them.
14:16
You know, whenever you work between traditional disciplines you discover that
14:24
you have no momma and you have no poppa.
14:28
You're on your own.
14:33
What I was able to do ultimately was to gather around myself other people who
14:41
similarly rather disdained traditional academic approaches and were just
14:49
interested in looking at the systems and sharing our perspectives with each other.
14:59
So, a true interdisciplinarian.
15:00
So,
15:05
you navigate between forestry and ecology, but found that each doesn't
15:10
really accept you due to the back and forth-ness or the interdisciplinary
15:15
nature of your own work, right?
15:17
Right.
15:18
And I probably was more accepted ultimately by the ecological community
15:25
than I was by the forestry community.
15:29
So, how would you describe your scientific style?
15:32
Is it experimental?
15:33
Observational?
15:33
More?
15:33
I'm very much oriented towards observation.
15:35
I'm
15:42
a big believer in the value of observing and very early on I really was exposed
15:53
to and learned to appreciate the value of very long-term observations.
16:02
My orientation has been observational.
16:05
It's been with a very long-term perspective,
16:13
but at the same time I'm capable of doing experiments and adopting an
16:21
experimental approach when it's useful.
16:29
But
16:32
I was never going to be limiting my activities to things that were-I've
16:39
never been interested in hypothesis-based research in the classic sense.
16:46
I'm not interested at all in null hypothesis
16:51
[research] . In ecology,
16:55
you rarely have an either/or situation.
16:59
You always have situations where multiple factors are contributing
17:04
to a particular outcome.
17:05
I've always thought the null hypothesis [approach] was
17:11
an ignorant way of going about research.
17:17
When you say null hypothesis you mean by having the hypothetical deductive
17:22
approach when you have a model or theory and you're developing [an] hypothesis
17:28
from that and trying to isolate variables?
17:31
Is that correct?
17:33
Because I had a Forest Service tradition, I worked for the Forest
17:36
Service research for 35 years, their
17:43
research plans were based on questions not on hypotheses.
17:49
So, I never really did
17:58
- until I went to the National Science Foundation - I never really dealt
18:03
much with hypothesis-based research.
18:06
When we started the research at the Andrews, we didn't have any hypotheses.
18:11
We just wanted to describe an old growth forest.
18:16
That's all we wanted to do.
18:20
We had no hypothesis to begin with, just simply a goal to
18:26
characterize carbon, water, nutrients in one of our old forests.
18:39
When you describe, is it primarily qualitative?
18:41
How do you go about describing what you find in the forest?
18:45
Well,
18:48
both qualitative and quantitative science.
18:50
You do both.
18:59
I've always been quite satisfied with order-of-magnitude kinds
19:03
of assessments of things.
19:08
I'm not willing to devote a great deal of time and energy to precise
19:14
quantification of anything.
19:19
I'm perfectly willing to accept order-of-magnitude in many cases.
19:24
There's
19:27
so much variability out there that
19:32
if you try to quantify something, you're going to discover that the
19:36
systems have quite a range [background noise] . That's my dog in the background.
19:43
I apologize for him.
19:44
He's playing with his toy.
19:47
[Laughs]
19:52
It's okay.
19:52
[Talking to dog] That's not helpful, big dog [laughs]
19:56
. He wants to contribute.
20:00
He knows how to be noisy.
20:08
Rather than hypotheses you say you're more focused on research questions.
20:12
What's your strategy in developing a research question?
20:15
How do you come to a research question?
20:19
Well, I'm not sure that this is really answering your question or not, but our
20:25
strategy was, you know, we had better begin by describing what this system
20:34
is and in the process of doing that, we almost immediately began to recognize
20:43
things that we hadn't recognized before.
20:46
Actually, out of the first few years of the work at the Andrews we had a lot
20:53
of really neat hypotheses for people to pursue, because questions began to
21:01
emerge very quickly from our description.
21:06
A great example was simply the deadwood.
21:10
We didn't get very far into describing the forest and the stream systems
21:17
before we said, "Oh my goodness, this is a lot of deadwood here. I guess
21:21
we'll have to account for it." Nobody in the world had accounted for it
21:26
before because it wasn't that important in most of the forests in the world.
21:33
I mean, it was a very difficult thing to measure, just as tree mortality
21:37
is a very difficult thing to measure, and so they [scientists elsewhere in
21:42
the world] did their ecosystem studies without having to come to grips with
21:48
that and when we did our first global summary in the International Biological
21:54
Program [s] , we discovered there was no category for deadwood in the summary
22:04
tables.
22:04
We changed the world's-we essentially alerted the world's forest ecologists to,
22:14
"Oh you're forgetting about something here and it's pretty damn important at times."
22:22
We've done that with a number of things where other places could sort of ignore
22:30
some of these things, but we could not.
22:35
Does that answer your question?
22:39
Certainly.
22:39
Okay.
22:39
Yes.
22:41
So, by describing certain things, like the importance of deadwood, you
22:46
were able to open the doors for a lot of other approaches to scientific
22:50
inquiry, including hypothesis?
22:52
Absolutely.
22:57
What's the dynamic of that wood?
23:00
What are
23:03
the inputs of deadwood?
23:06
How long does it persist and what are the outputs of deadwood
23:11
and what does deadwood do?
23:16
Very quickly you discover it's a storehouse of carbon and nutrients.
23:21
Very quickly you discover its habitat.
23:24
Very quickly you discover that it interacts with geomorphic processes, like
23:29
erosion and deposition and so, once you see something, you begin to really ask
23:38
questions about its dynamics and its role.
23:50
I know Richard Waring has a similar background as you, right, in ecology and
23:55
botany, but you two both sort of branched in terms of your styles of science?
24:00
Yeah, Dick has always been interested in the ultimate null hypothesis.
24:04
Yeah, very different [laughs]
24:07
. Yeah.
24:07
I've always been interested in the significance of different species.
24:16
At times Dick has taken the position that species don't matter in terms of
24:22
the things that he's interested in.
24:26
Of course, as time has gone on, I've become more and more persuaded
24:29
that species are profoundly important, particularly tree species.
24:36
Dick and I, we're very different in terms of our orientation, but
24:42
we were able to work together long enough to get something going.
24:46
Yes, certainly.
24:49
Dick's departure from the ecosystem research really reflected the fact that he
24:57
really wanted to pursue null hypotheses, very fundamental, very simple questions.
25:06
The majority of the Andrews people didn't want to do that.
25:12
He just, the program wasn't a good fit for him and the people in the
25:17
program weren't a good fit for him.
25:20
Do
25:23
you mind elaborating about the importance of tree species?
25:27
Pardon?
25:27
Do you mind elaborating about the importance of tree species?
25:31
I mean, good heavenly days.
25:34
For
25:37
us,
25:40
the Douglas fir is absolutely a critical species and it's not one that
25:46
hemlock can substitute for in terms of the longevity and the size of the
25:54
material and the persistence of the material.
25:55
If
25:59
you want a real contrast, you can look at the hemlock forest on the coast which
26:08
grow very rapidly and then collapse, essentially, and you can look at the
26:16
Douglas fir forest, which persist as
26:24
really intact entities for hundreds of years before they
26:30
begin to really break down.
26:33
Then you can look at redwood [forest] , which just never quits.
26:37
It's
26:42
also a species that sprouts from the stump, which of
26:46
course none of the conifers do.
26:51
The species makes a huge difference in terms of the architecture
26:57
that can be developed and the persistence of that architecture.
27:05
We're so biased towards Douglas fir that we think all forests
27:09
behave that way and the don't.
27:14
But it's led foresters and ecologists in this region to think.
27:20
"Well, all stands are going to behave like this." No, they aren't.
27:26
Some are going to develop and
27:29
evolve to much more complex condition much more rapidly than others
27:40
are.
27:40
Then how do you think that is in conversation with certain models
27:45
of carbon sequestration models.
27:47
Would you say knowing the species is fundamental and would influence those?
27:52
There are
27:55
some kinds of modeling that you can do that don't need species, but
28:00
they're not very useful models in terms of predictive capabilities.
28:05
If you really want predictive capability, you're going to have to
28:09
know something about the natural history of the species you're interested in.
28:15
There was a-I'm trying to remember his name-but there was a really
28:21
great experimental ecologist
28:25
down in the southeast and
28:29
I was in a conference one time that was looking at the role of ecological
28:35
theory and applications, and we were going around the table saying what our
28:43
philosophy was and he was about two people in front of me and what he said
28:48
just stunned everybody, because [he said] : "I don't use theory when people
28:51
come to me with problems. When people come to me with a real-world problem I rely
28:57
on my knowledge of the natural history of that system and those organisms." I
29:05
don't do the other.
29:08
That was what I was going to say, that there's no
29:16
[phone rings in the background] -it'll be over with in
29:23
a second here-anyway, my attitude has always been that, if you
29:29
really want predictive ability in terms of a real world problem,
29:41
that you're going to have to basically understand something about
29:46
the natural history of the system and the organisms that are part of
29:54
it.
29:54
Let's see... then, in terms of natural history would you say that that's still
30:00
a prominent part of ecology today?
30:03
No, it's not.
30:05
Yeah.
30:06
You know it's not popular at all.
30:12
There are many reasons for it, but it's just not the fashion these days.
30:20
I
30:22
can relate in my field of anthropology.
30:25
It used to be very much specific you study a particular culture of people and
30:30
what you want to study is that culture of people, but a lot of people are
30:34
arguing or have the sentiment that that's being lost or having universal theories
30:38
to explain all cultures everywhere.
30:41
But, it's like what happened to the specifics of this place and these peoples.
30:45
It's very-there's a lot of difference there, and it's worth
30:49
studying that difference and what's particular to that group of people.
30:53
I think that parallels a little bit with natural history and ecology.
30:56
Well, it is.
30:59
It's critical.
31:01
I'm learning
31:07
more natural history all the time still at my age and I've learned the
31:13
role of a vine maple plays and I've learned the role the devil's club
31:17
plays and they're important roles!
31:21
But it's easy for someone who doesn't know to dismiss them as not
31:28
only irrelevant but an annoyance.
31:38
An annoyance how so?
31:40
Well, if you're walking through a forest and, if it's full of vine maple,
31:46
you're constantly being tripped up.
31:48
I see-like physically annoying.
31:50
Slapped in the face, tripped up and it's just like I was taught
31:58
as a forestry student to think of downed logs as a waste, a fire
32:03
hazard, and an impediment to travel.
32:10
How could I not see that something as big as a big downed log has got to have
32:16
an ecological function in the system?
32:20
But foresters do-if a tree's dead, it's no longer relevant.
32:25
It has no value unless we take it.
32:29
In fact, it's dangerous.
32:32
It's clutter.
32:34
Yeah,
32:38
but [it has] come a long way with that and thanks to the
32:41
science from the Andrews Forest.
32:43
Oh yeah.
32:44
The value of deadwood, right?
32:47
You're going to see a lot of it.
32:49
There's going to be a lot of people that want to salvage
32:51
the daylights out of the burns.
32:53
For
32:57
my next question-what are your thoughts in regards to
33:00
objectivity in scientific research?
33:04
What do I think about it?
33:06
Mm-hmm.
33:08
Well, I think you can try to make yourself as objective as you can possibly be.
33:18
We do things so that we can eliminate some of the more obvious kinds of biases.
33:27
Instead of
33:29
picking out where you want to put a plot, you put in a whole series
33:34
of plots so that you can determine what the variability really is.
33:41
We do things to make more objective and when we do experiments, we do designs very
33:48
careful designs to avoid biasing them.
33:54
Obviously, you know we are influenced by our interests in terms of what we study
34:03
and so
34:07
that's certainly played a role in the case of doing the research on old growth.
34:15
I'd always wanted to and several other people working with me, like Ted
34:19
Dyrness, also wanted to really learn something about old growth forests.
34:26
The Forest Service didn't want to do it.
34:29
They weren't interested.
34:30
They were just going to cut them down and convert them to plantations.
34:35
But we ended up having an opportunity to get a hold of a sack of money through
34:41
the National Science Foundation and that gave us independence so we could do it.
34:50
And we did.
34:53
Anyway, objectivity, yeah, I think you know we strive to be as objective as
35:02
possible, as clear-minded as we can be, but, clearly, we're not objective
35:08
about what we choose to study.
35:12
That is to say we're not making a random selection of what it is we could study.
35:19
We have interests.
35:25
To go back to experiment and talk about the study on old growth and all
35:32
the knowledge that emerged from that turning point with ecological forestry,
35:37
would you say that a lot of that, how did you come to produce that knowledge?
35:42
Was a lot of observational and based on natural history and description?
35:48
Well, in many ways
35:52
it was observational.
35:55
It was the descriptions that we did of old forests and the mature
36:01
forest and the young forest.
36:03
It was the observations of what was happening in the
36:06
blast zone of Mount St. Helens.
36:14
It wasn't just my isolated observations.
36:17
The key was I was working with other people that were observing the same sorts
36:22
of things, that were observing the similar system but were viewing it from a very
36:28
different perspective than I was, maybe from the standpoint of the aquatic system,
36:34
the fish, maybe from the standpoint of
36:40
landslides, like Fred Swanson was.
36:45
When you have a team of very observant people who are looking at similar
36:53
situations and at the Andrews, we're looking at the same forest, we're looking
36:58
at the same stream... St. Helens... then if they're dialoguing with each other
37:08
and learning from each other, you know the outcome's going to be profound.
37:16
I would like to say that I don't think I learned anything on my own.
37:21
I learned everything I know through observation and
37:26
conversations with other people.
37:31
My gift is probably one of being able to integrate many people's work.
37:44
Of course, I had a bit of a hand as well in influencing what it was they worked on.
37:53
I was able with sort of my overall vision of what this forest was about was able
38:01
to say hey we need somebody to go look at this, we need somebody to go work at
38:06
that and that resulted in ultimately us being able to put together a pretty good
38:16
first order picture of what a coniferous forest ecosystem really looks like.
38:24
When I was young, I was also driven by anger.
38:30
I was very angry that people were developing supposedly
38:38
universal theories about forest systems that didn't have anything-that
38:43
didn't fit my forest at all!
38:46
I was angry at the eastern ecology regime and, by golly, it was one of the things
38:55
I was bound and determined that they are going to have to take account of
39:04
what our forests were like.
39:07
And they did have to take account of them.
39:09
But I was driven early on in my career by frustration and agitation over, you
39:18
know, the failure to appreciate these
39:50
forests.
39:50
[Phone rings and voicemail message ensues] . Sorry about the phone intruding.
39:50
No worries at all.
39:52
Okay what's the next question?
39:54
Yeah.
39:55
Let's see here.
39:57
As a researcher, how do you use the scientific method to find truth?
40:04
I don't know
40:08
[laughs] . How do I use the scientific method?
40:09
The scientific method is in ecology is to go out and actually look at
40:17
what's out there and, you know, the most important aspect I think of the scientific
40:25
method and looking at forest ecosystems is looking at what's really happening
40:31
over time under different circumstances.
40:36
I
40:38
often would tell students
40:44
the only truth is what you actually observe out there happening.
40:49
That's the truth.
40:50
Model outputs don't-they're not truth.
40:55
They're useful at times, but they're not truth.
40:58
You want to know the truth of what's happening you must observe it.
41:05
Sometimes you can experimentally change it and then observe what
41:11
happens, but so much of ecology is very long transient responses to things.
41:22
It's so important, and
41:27
science, a lot of traditional science doesn't take that perspective at all.
41:37
In a sense, the scientific method is, of course, to develop a hypothesis
41:41
and to test it in some way.
41:43
That's the scientific method.
41:46
But
41:50
in the case of ecology, the scientific method is sort of
41:54
to observe a circumstance, make predictions about what is going to
41:59
happen and then observe what happens
42:07
[laughs]
42:09
. Are there- [JF continues talking]
42:10
. I don't claim to be much of a scientist.
42:13
Okay.
42:14
In any kind of the traditional sense.
42:17
Mm-hmm.
42:21
Are there other means to truths, if I may ask?
42:24
Other what?
42:25
Means to finding truths?
42:27
Well, I think I just described some.
42:29
Yeah.
42:31
One of the ways of finding truth is to observe nature.
42:38
I think that can be a very important one.
42:45
Would you say-is there a dialogue, would you say, between you and the forest?
42:57
I'm not sure how to respond to that.
43:01
In many ways, you know, it's been miraculous in my view that I have
43:11
been put in so many situations where I learn as a consequence
43:17
of what I observed in the forest.
43:22
Is there a dialogue?
43:24
In a traditional sense, no.
43:28
But is there a dialogue in the sense of interacting with these
43:39
ecosystems repeatedly interacting with them and learning from that?
43:42
Yes, there is that kind of dialogue.
43:50
You have to do a lot.
43:57
I've always felt that if you really want to know
44:04
as much as you can about forest ecosystems you've got to learn at a lot of them.
44:12
You've got to look at some of them well enough that you really get to
44:15
know them in a very intimate fashion.
44:22
I've been fortunate in being able to-I got involved in a
44:31
project in Tierra del Fuego and
44:38
it ended up being a tremendous learning experience for me in which I learned
44:43
about deciduous hardwood forests.
44:50
I've just repeatedly been put into situations where critical pieces of
44:57
knowledge make themselves apparent.
45:00
Mount St. Helens eruption...
45:05
anyway, is there a dialogue?
45:10
Well, yes, there is.
45:17
Is it between sentient creatures?
45:21
No, I don't necessarily think it is, but then at times I'm
45:25
very suspicious about it.
45:31
My next question-are there laws of nature do you think?
45:36
Oh, I think there are some givens, yeah.
45:41
You
45:52
know we live, and we die.
45:55
We're recycled.
45:57
That's a given, as far as I'm concerned.
46:02
Then
46:06
another given is you know the different species have different kinds of
46:15
life histories.
46:17
I know trees best and
46:21
trees have very diverse life histories
46:30
and some of them are interpreted as adaptations, although you
46:35
wonder how much of it was just very fundamental to, for example,
46:43
a genus, let alone a species.
46:48
Laws of nature-well, yeah there's certainly physical and chemical
46:54
laws, but there's almost no boundary conditions to the diversity of life and
47:08
it's just a whole lot of different ways you can put an ecosystem together.
47:19
There's an incredible richness in ecology that you don't really see in chemistry
47:28
and physics because they have laws in the sense of things that actions and
47:39
reactions, responses to conditions.
47:45
I haven't thought much about it.
47:50
This is my last question for this section and then we can maybe take a
47:54
break and move on to the second section.
47:57
What are your overall motivations?
47:59
Is it for curiosity?
48:01
For finding real world solutions?
48:05
My motivation,
48:08
yeah, most fundamentally, my
48:14
parents gave me my motivation which was to try to leave the world in a
48:18
better place than it was when I came.
48:23
I made a decision as a youngster, as a teenager, that I was going to focus what I
48:30
did on the forest in trying to help them.
48:35
I concluded that the best way-I didn't conclude, but I evolved the
48:40
best way that I could possibly do that is to increase our knowledge
48:45
of the ecosystems and to share that knowledge as widely as I possibly could.
48:56
My motivation then was really to,
49:01
well, I describe it at times as to cut the best deal I could for forest and trees
49:06
in a world dominated by human beings.
49:09
That was my motivation and I tried to very much follow that
49:18
in the decisions I made about my career.
49:22
I would periodically go and sit in the forest and report why I was doing and
49:29
examine what my motivation was in what I was choosing to do at that time.
49:39
Some decisions I made were very clearly based on pursuing that mission
49:45
rather than seeking the greatest ego satisfaction that I could.
49:52
You know,
49:55
I would have been very easy and rewarding in some ways to go up in the hierarchy of
50:06
the Forest Service, but that wouldn't be the best way of serving the
50:14
mission that I'd set for myself.
50:20
My motivations are pretty clear.
50:22
Of course, obviously as a human being I wanted
50:28
to feel good about what I did.
50:30
I wanted to enjoy what I did.
50:32
I certainly wanted to be out in the forest because that's what I really loved.
50:38
I was also serving my own interest at the same time.
50:41
It was a very wonderful and it turned out to be a very rewarding
50:50
way to go.
50:52
But I didn't know it was going to be that way at the beginning and I was willing
50:57
to settle for whatever came along.
51:03
Thank you.
51:03
Do you want to take just a 5-minute break here?
51:07
I don't need to.
51:09
Okay, I might just go, just to use the restroom.
51:11
Do you need to?
51:11
Mm-hmm.
51:13
Okay.
51:22
In this next section I inquire about different traditions in approaches of
51:27
science on a community level and what role these different approaches contribute to
51:32
the Andrews science community as a whole.
51:36
So, during your time with the Andrews Forest, what role did natural history
51:42
play, or still play, in the community?
51:49
It plays a very major role.
51:51
I think we've already talked about that some, because I think that the natural
51:58
history information is the critical information when you are actually
52:04
dealing with a real-world situation and
52:10
what we can do in science is make clear the range of possibilities
52:17
that can exist, just depending upon the particular attributes
52:24
of the species that are involved.
52:26
But
52:29
I think that it's really important.
52:33
I know you expressed earlier your importance or value for natural history.
52:38
Do you think that sentiment echoes to the community as a whole?
52:43
I don't know if it does or not.
52:45
Okay.
52:49
The problem with it is that the amount of information that's needed given
52:56
the diversity that's present in an ecosystem, any ecosystem, including
53:02
the forest ecosystem, is that
53:11
it's immense in terms of potential investments.
53:15
The
53:23
science traditionally, you know, is looking for patterns
53:27
so that it doesn't have to
53:31
deal with that kind of species-specific or situation-specific information.
53:39
Yet,
53:42
I don't-ultimately you have to have people who have sufficient knowledge
53:50
in these specific situations, if you're going to come up with optimal
53:55
kinds of solutions to the problems.
54:00
There may be ways in which you know we could engage more people in
54:07
society in actually developing that kind of natural history information.
54:15
I think about, you know, there's a lot of people that don't
54:18
have a lot to do right now and
54:23
one of the ways that would be very productive for them and for
54:28
society would be to engage them in some of this kind of work.
54:40
What about observational approaches at the Andrews Forest?
54:45
I know there's people who characterize the Andrews as primarily
54:49
bottom-top kind of research.
54:51
Would you agree with that?
54:55
Yeah.
55:01
I think one of the really critical things that relates to observation is
55:09
that we need to be investing much more heavily in observing the consequences
55:17
of activities, monitoring if you would.
55:24
That's a case where systematic observation over very long time
55:29
periods is really critical to assessing both the state of our knowledge, how
55:36
accurate our predictions have been about what's happening, but also
55:43
one of the things that we do with that is also identify where we've made
55:50
mistakes or where in fact there are
55:57
events of some kind that dramatically alter responses.
56:03
I guess my point again, to go back to the beginning, is simply I think
56:09
much more systematic long-term observation is needed in a variety of settings
56:19
in order to really to test the
56:30
rigor of our knowledge.
56:39
What about hypothesis-driven or experimental research?
56:43
I know that you said with NSF that was sort of the first time
56:48
that you got really involved.
56:51
Does hypothesis-driven characterize much of the work that's done at Andrews
56:56
Forest or is it primarily observational?
57:00
Well, I think there's a real place for experimentation and you know I
57:10
was really responsible in one way or another for a very large experiment
57:15
called "DEMO" [Demonstration of
57:20
Ecosystem Management Optoins] . Experiments that are done carefully
57:26
can really be very helpful
57:31
and they're not necessarily hypothesis-based, simply exploring, for
57:39
example, what are the consequences of leaving-in the case of that experiment-15%
57:48
retention or 40% retention [of live tree canopy] ? What's the consequences
57:54
of leaving it in the form of dispersed trees versus aggregated trees?
58:01
Experiments that are well-designed can be very useful.
58:08
In a sense our testing hypotheses, but I don't really think of them
58:15
that way so much as trying to begin to define ranges of responses.
58:23
There's a continuum of possible treatments.
58:27
What kind of responses do we see if we leave fewer trees
58:34
or if we leave more trees?
58:40
Is it a smooth continuum or are there some jumps along the way where we encounter
58:47
some kind of an effect that moves it to a different state, so to speak?
58:57
Anyway,
59:00
I
59:04
also have to admit that in many ways I use-what I think many times what I
59:18
lay out for people could be structured in a hypothesis, as a hypothesis.
59:31
I often have created a number of theoretical constructs.
59:37
You can always turn those into hypotheses, if you wish to do so.
59:45
I just haven't chosen to think of them that way.
59:51
I also haven't chosen to think of many of the constructs as theory in
59:55
a classical sense, but that's very broadly speaking what they are.
1:00:04
I mean, the
1:00:07
forest development model that I developed is very clearly a
1:00:16
theoretical construct.
1:00:27
What about ecosystem modeling, or modeling in general?
1:00:31
What place does that serve in the Andrews Forest?
1:00:37
I think it can be very useful, as long as you don't
1:00:44
[audio unintelligible] . Models can be a way of seeing where you are in
1:00:48
terms of your knowledge of the system.
1:00:52
I think models are simply a way of building a vision of a system
1:01:00
or the structure of a system or how a system is working.
1:01:05
I think it can be very useful.
1:01:08
I think when it becomes dangerous is when people begin to think
1:01:12
that model outputs represent
1:01:16
something that's real.
1:01:17
That
1:01:21
worries me a lot.
1:01:26
It's kind of like interpreting remote imagery without having any ground truth.
1:01:32
That worries me a lot.
1:01:36
That's an interesting way to put it.
1:01:39
So, the concern is that models they're meant to be tools for thinking but
1:01:45
some people confuse them with reality?
1:01:48
Well, they really are.
1:01:50
One of the classic ones was one of the very early forest succession models.
1:01:56
It was built at Hubbard Brook [Experimental Forest in NH] and
1:02:04
what they did was they didn't know how to model mortality.
1:02:12
They can model birth and they can model growth, but they didn't have good
1:02:17
information on mortality, so what Dan Botkin decided to do was we'll do it
1:02:23
this way: the bigger a tree gets and the older it gets as it approaches its
1:02:29
maximum age and maximum size [maximum age actually was the primary one], that it's
1:02:37
probability of dying will be increased.
1:02:42
The older you are the more likely you are to die.
1:02:46
Well, it turns out that it varies like mad with tree species and they don't,
1:02:53
almost none of them, behave that way.
1:02:58
The bigger and older the Douglas fir tree is the more likely it
1:03:02
is to survive the next year, or the next measurement increment.
1:03:10
Every species has its own unique pattern of mortality and, again, with
1:03:18
the Douglas fir and the redcedar, the bigger and older you are the more likely
1:03:24
you are to survive the next increment.
1:03:26
With redwood, the bigger and older you are the more likely you are to never die
1:03:36
[laughs] . That was a prize example of a model that guy was trying to
1:03:41
put together for forest dynamics that was premised totally inappropriately,
1:03:49
inaccurately, was absolutely not the case for some of the species.
1:03:58
Just to clarify, would you say then that models brush over a lot of
1:04:02
difference and that difference is really important to be aware of?
1:04:05
They certainly do.
1:04:08
Absolutely.
1:04:16
Are there other approaches to ecological research that we haven't discussed
1:04:20
aside from natural history and experimental and hypothesis and modeling?
1:04:35
I'm not sure.
1:04:44
I think that really covers it.
1:04:49
I don't know what else you could do.
1:05:00
Can you think of some?
1:05:03
Actually, another question I have, which may or may not pertain to that
1:05:07
question, is with the Andrews Forest in the early 2000s they started the
1:05:14
LTE Reflections Program [Long-Term Ecological Reflections] to bring in
1:05:17
artists and humanists and philosophers.
1:05:20
I'm not sure-around what time did you leave the Andrews Forest to go
1:05:27
to the University of Washington?
1:05:29
I can't quite remember the year.
1:05:33
What about?
1:05:34
Sorry, to leave Andrews Forest to go to the University of Washington-where
1:05:37
you around for the LTE Reflections Program when that started?
1:05:42
That's another way of thinking about them.
1:05:45
It's another way of perceiving them, but not scientifically investigating them.
1:05:53
There are infinite ways of interpreting or experiencing forest systems, absolutely.
1:06:09
Some of them are really tremendously enjoyable.
1:06:13
I mean, lying in a sleeping bag at the campground at the Andrews
1:06:21
Experimental Forest looking at the stars and listening to Lookout Creek,
1:06:28
that's a wonderful experience, but it's not a scientific investigation.
1:06:36
It has to do with how we as human beings are
1:06:44
perceiving those systems and are being either
1:06:50
negatively or positively impacted in terms of our aesthetics, our feelings.
1:07:00
What
1:07:06
year did you leave the Andrews Forest to go to the University of Washington?
1:07:13
Basically, that was 1986.
1:07:16
What had happened was in 1985 I took a sabbatical and went to Harvard
1:07:22
Forest and while I was at Harvard Forest, I was offered a position
1:07:28
at the University of Washington and I took that position, obviously.
1:07:37
We actually tried to persuade the Forestry School at Oregon State to hire
1:07:46
me so I could stay in Corvallis and continue to work with the team of people
1:07:51
that I'd worked with, but the dean was very anxious to get me out of town.
1:07:55
He wanted me gone.
1:07:58
The dean at that time
1:08:02
really viewed the research on old growth as being
1:08:11
not only without value, but actually being
1:08:22
aversive.
1:08:22
That was my fault, so he wanted me out of town.
1:08:27
But '86 I took the position at the University of Washington.
1:08:37
I just have a couple of concluding questions for you.
1:08:43
What significant ideas have emerged from the Andrews science community and
1:08:47
how did these ideas evolve in terms of questions and methods over time?
1:08:50
I know you touched on this a little bit but maybe sort of just to sum up.
1:08:57
I think the consequence of the Andrews research has been really sound.
1:09:07
I can cite individual epiphanies,
1:09:12
like the recognition that deadwood is really important in an ecosystem, but,
1:09:24
interestingly, the Andrews was the first place where we really for the first
1:09:31
time defined what a forest ecosystem is, essentially created a comprehensive
1:09:42
vision of what a forest ecosystem is composed of and what it does.
1:09:51
People have worked at pieces of
1:09:57
it.
1:09:57
The people at Hubbard Brook and the people at Coweeta [Hydrologic
1:10:00
Laboratory in NC] had worked at it, but
1:10:04
it turned out that the work at the Andrews, although it began really looking
1:10:13
at an old growth forest, which we thought was going to become essentially extinct
1:10:20
as an ecosystem, we thought we were just documenting a disappearing system, in fact
1:10:31
ended up providing the framework for what a forest ecosystem consists
1:10:37
of and how you think about it.
1:10:41
Although we started with an old forest, we then asked questions about
1:10:47
well, where does a forest come from?
1:10:49
How does it develop over time?
1:10:52
So, we ended up looking at disturbances to forests and how forests respond
1:10:58
to those disturbances and how the ecosystem then begins a new developmental
1:11:05
cycle and we learned something about the young forest and then we
1:11:12
looked at the mature forest, which
1:11:17
can be viewed as nothing more than a conversion where you go from
1:11:23
a very simple, top-loaded, young forest to a very complex, spatially
1:11:28
heterogeneous, bottom-loaded old forest.
1:11:36
Focus on the old growth became a focus on what a forest ecosystem is and
1:11:42
how it develops and sustains itself.
1:11:48
I
1:11:51
think you know
1:11:55
it changed the whole perception that foresters and forest-interested
1:12:04
people had of what a forest was.
1:12:08
You go back 60 years to when I was in forestry school, you say what is a forest?
1:12:14
Or a forest is a collection of trees and you manage it to produce wood.
1:12:23
That's what we thought a forest was.
1:12:26
Perhaps somebody might have said, "Well, it's got to be something more than that.
1:12:32
Well, I've got no information on what that might be."
1:12:42
What we have now is we've created, in fact,
1:12:49
this basic understanding of what a forest system is about, not every detail.
1:12:56
We're not omniscient.
1:12:58
But we understand, "Ah!
1:13:01
I understand what the structure of the forest is, and I understand
1:13:04
what functions of a forest are.
1:13:08
I understand how it develops over time.
1:13:11
I understand how it responds to disturbances." That kind of understanding
1:13:23
has become global.
1:13:27
The
1:13:30
Andrews and the Andrews team get a tremendous amount of credit for that.
1:13:37
They've changed our whole vision of what a forest is.
1:13:42
It's
1:13:44
like Leopold said, once you know something, you begin to care about it.
1:13:54
That's what's happened.
1:13:57
Oh, it isn't just about wood production.
1:14:01
It's about all of these other functional things that these forests do.
1:14:06
We have to be sure that in our pursuit of economic gain, we don't
1:14:11
lose all of those other capacities.
1:14:13
We've got to learn how to sustain all of those capacities.
1:14:18
That doesn't mean you don't cut them.
1:14:22
It just means you learn how to do that in a way that doesn't
1:14:27
essentially cripple the system.
1:14:33
I think that's a very large and profound contribution that the team of people
1:14:43
working on the Andrews has made.
1:14:47
That was an extraordinary group of people.
1:14:50
It really was.
1:14:55
It was magical.
1:14:58
It was.
1:15:00
That's while you still got people like me coming to study
1:15:05
what's going on.
1:15:08
As my final question, what do you see are the principles and motivating forces
1:15:12
that drive the Andrews as a community?
1:15:17
Well, I think probably what drove us more than anything was to understand as
1:15:27
much as we could about these systems and
1:15:33
to share that very widely so that no matter what else people had to think
1:15:39
about it and take account of it.
1:15:44
I've often thought, you know, that more than anything
1:15:50
we wanted to understand it, but we also wanted people to have an appreciation
1:15:57
for its complexity, its richness, and we wanted them to be respectful of that.
1:16:11
I think we all shared that.
1:16:16
I think that's why it was a magical group because
1:16:24
we shared that.
1:16:27
We never talked about it, but we shared it.
1:16:31
It really made us very open to each other, made us committed to this common outcome.
1:16:46
We had,
1:16:52
I guess you would call it a training session at one point
1:16:56
when I was running the program.
1:16:58
We brought a facilitator in and brought all of the team together
1:17:05
in order to develop more
1:17:11
of a personal interaction among the group.
1:17:14
One of the things that the fella said at the end was you are the
1:17:21
spokesman for this ecosystem.
1:17:27
That's your job.
1:17:29
You have developed that understanding and your mission now is to share
1:17:35
that, to speak for the system.
1:17:38
I like to tell resource managers that they have two jobs: one of
1:17:44
them is to inform the public as best they can about the potentials and
1:17:50
limitations of the ecosystems that they're responsible for managing so
1:17:55
that hopefully people make intelligent decisions, but, also, their job is to
1:18:01
represent the ecosystem to the humans.
1:18:06
They have that job of understanding it so that they can speak
1:18:12
for, they can represent it.
1:18:16
That's what we were doing.
1:18:20
Thank you.
1:18:21
Are there any other final comments that you'd like to add
1:18:25
before we end the interview?
1:18:28
I hadn't thought about that for a long time, but that's clearly what we did.
1:18:34
Great, well, thank you.
