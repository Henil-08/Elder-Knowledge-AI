Hi, my name is Sara Khatib and this research is for my master's thesis.
00:13
The research involves history of different traditions of science at the
00:17
Andrews Forest and the philosophical perceptions of nature that underlie
00:20
these different traditions.
00:22
I would like to ask you a few open-ended questions regarding these topics.
00:26
I expect the duration of the interview to take up to one hour to complete.
00:31
Would you like to participate in this interview?
00:34
Yes.
00:36
Glad to do so.
00:37
Thank you.
00:39
We can end the interview at any point you wish to do so.
00:42
Please inform me right away if you no longer want to participate and
00:46
the interview will immediately end.
00:48
Do I have permission to record this interview?
00:51
Yes, you do.
00:53
Lastly, this interview will be deposited with the Oregon State University Library
00:58
Special Collections and Archive Research Center for preservation and access.
01:05
SCARC's commitment to open access includes the release of contextualized
01:09
interview content online.
01:11
Are you willing for this interview and its derivatives, including a
01:14
transcript and an interview abstract to be made available online?
01:18
Yes, I am.
01:19
Okay, sounds good.
01:21
We'll now get moving forward with the interview.
01:27
We are here today with Dr. Mark Harmon who received his Ph.D. in 1986 at
01:32
Oregon State University, Corvallis.
01:34
Mark Harmon's research interests include ecosystem succession processes,
01:38
decomposition, nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics and landscape dynamics and he
01:44
installed the well-known and monumental 200-year log decomposition experiment.
01:49
Thank you for being here with us, Dr. Mark Harmon.
01:53
You're welcome.
01:54
If you're ready to begin, the first section of this interview is going
02:00
to include a set of questions that inquire about your perception of an
02:04
ecosystem and your personal philosophy and take on scientific research.
02:08
So, how the way you perceive nature influences your scientific approach.
02:13
My first question I would like to ask you is how would you
02:17
define an ecosystem, personally?
02:21
The
02:25
first thing, ecosystems involve both the biotic and abiotic environment,
02:32
and how they interact with each other in a very general sense.
02:36
That's because you can actually study the biology on its own or the abiotic
02:42
environment, like the climate, without thinking about how they affect each other.
02:47
That's the first thing.
02:49
The second thing is in my mind it's really a set of processes, kinds of processes
02:55
that are being investigated at the ecosystem level, an ecosystem science.
03:02
What do I mean by that?
03:03
Well, ecosystem science involves studying how matter and energy are stored and flow.
03:11
That's
03:15
all it is.
03:15
There are a lot of things that influence that, including humans.
03:19
It doesn't mean it doesn't involve humans.
03:22
That's the basic subject matter.
03:25
Where, say, is carbon stored in the forest?
03:27
How does it move from one pool to another pool?
03:30
How does it leave the ecosystem and go to the atmosphere and vice versa?
03:36
That's what
03:38
ecosystems are to me.
03:39
I realized they're also used in a very, very general sense.
03:44
Some people might think of them as the community of organisms, but
03:49
I think that's community science.
03:53
To me, I've got kind of a very, I think, standard ecosystem science
03:59
definition of an ecosystem.
04:03
From the perspective of an ecosystem scientist, is that correct?
04:07
Yeah, to me an ecosystem is what an ecosystem scientist studies.
04:15
How would you describe the nature of an ecosystem?
04:20
Is it static?
04:22
Is it dynamic?
04:23
Orderly?
04:24
Chaotic?
04:26
Well, here's an interesting thing about ecosystems and
04:29
ecological science in general.
04:31
The answer to that question would really depend on the level that you looked at it.
04:38
There isn't one answer to it.
04:39
What do I mean by that?
04:41
Well, and this relates to a landscape.
04:47
It could be that a particular area, an ecosystem, is say
04:54
affected by a disturbance.
04:56
Another one is recovering from a disturbance.
04:59
If you looked at it at the small spatial scale, you'd see, well, one seems to
05:04
be changing slowly and the other very quickly, must be a very dynamic system.
05:10
But, it's entirely possible for that to happen at the landscape level
05:15
for nothing to be going on, just changing places where it's going on.
05:22
That's an interesting facet of
05:26
ecological science in general.
05:30
Answers like that depend on scale.
05:33
Something seen at the level of an individual person could
05:37
seem totally chaotic, but at the level of the population of
05:43
people be completely predictable.
05:49
That's why I don't think it's one or the other.
05:53
I don't think that they are ever completely static, because,
05:59
even at that higher level where things seem to be cancelling
06:02
out, it never does it perfectly.
06:05
The system is changing.
06:09
It's just a matter of degree.
06:15
Would you say the system's always changing?
06:18
Well, it's always changing to some degree.
06:23
It's whether we can measure it or not or can we observe it.
06:27
In theory, there are always subtle changings.
06:31
Nothing is exactly staying on, say, one parameter, staying on one number forever.
06:38
That never happens in nature.
06:41
It does have a high degree of
06:45
variability compared to, say, a strictly physical system.
06:49
Nonetheless,
06:52
there are cases where it appears to change very, very slowly, if at all,
06:58
or have very little variation and there are cases in which it seems to
07:03
change radically, say, with the recent wildfires we just had near the Andrews.
07:14
As an example.
07:15
As an example.
07:18
Within the Andrews Forest itself would you say that there are times and spaces
07:23
or cases when it changes radically and times when it changes much more subtly,
07:28
just within the Andrews Forest alone?
07:31
Absolutely, absolutely.
07:34
Usually the change is largest after a big event that disturbs things that kind of
07:42
rearranges the system and then it will reorganize itself, or seem to anyway,
07:53
and then when you get to older forests that had been a long time since they'd
07:59
been disturbed, they seem to change more slowly, at least at a big scale.
08:04
But if you analyze
08:08
something like mortality, death of trees, at the level of trees, we wrote a paper
08:15
on this, it appears like most trees
08:21
continue to live, but a few die.
08:23
It seems like, well, if you're looking at those few trees
08:26
that died [that's] big change.
08:28
If you look at the rest of the trees, not.
08:35
It really depends on scale.
08:37
I can't emphasize that too much.
08:41
One of the problems of describing them, they're complexity is this fact
08:47
that at different scales or levels of organization you see different things.
08:54
It's all the same thing.
08:57
It's just manifested in different ways.
09:01
I hope that makes sense.
09:02
No, it does.
09:03
Thank you.
09:03
That's what makes ecological science really fascinating.
09:12
The immense amount of variability along spatial and temporal scales.
09:17
Depends on how you look at it.
09:19
That's tough to communicate for managers.
09:22
I mean, just look at the reaction to the fires.
09:26
It's like the world is ending.
09:28
I realize people lost homes and all that.
09:30
Don't let me make it seem like that wasn't important, but in the forest, you
09:38
know, this sort of thing, it happens.
09:41
It's happened historically.
09:42
It's not really that surprising.
09:48
Anyways, yes it definitely occurs in the Andrews at some levels and not others.
09:53
Depends on what happens, too.
09:58
One of the things we found is that no matter what level you look at ecosystems,
10:03
there's always some surprise event.
10:08
Just when you think it's all behaving normally, there's always something that
10:12
comes in that surprises people and we wrote a paper on this and you'd think
10:21
at some level forests of the world mortality would be very predictable,
10:27
because you'd have all the disturbances and all the human things going on.
10:31
Then there's asteroids, which occur more frequently than people
10:36
ever imagine, and they affect huge areas of the globe, of the forest.
10:43
There's always something else that will come along to upset what you think is a
10:48
very predictable, well-behaved system.
10:55
And open the door to a whole new path of learning and discovering.
10:59
Yes, that's right.
11:02
I think that's characterized a lot of the stories that have come
11:05
out of the Andrews Forest, right, throughout the history of surprises
11:11
that sort of shake the community?
11:15
Yeah, I think that's probably true.
11:21
What is your theoretical or philosophical background and how is
11:26
that applied to your scientific process?
11:30
Well,
11:33
I sort of believe in
11:36
triangulation.
11:39
I know there are people who are more
11:44
observational, where you might call a founding scientist of the
11:47
Andrews, like Jerry Franklin, are very observational in their nature.
11:51
They've discovered a lot about forests.
11:55
There are some who are very, very oriented towards experiments, experiments
12:01
are the only way to learn things.
12:03
I've done enough experiments to realize there's things like confounding factors.
12:10
They tend to reduce the system down to what it isn't so you can figure out
12:17
what it is, which can be misleading.
12:22
In other words, you take out all these factors that you know will influence
12:25
the result to figure out what's controlling the system, but then you've
12:30
left out all those things that you knew where going to affect the system.
12:34
So, what does that mean?
12:38
Then, I also do a lot of modeling using theoretical constructs
12:47
to understand the system.
12:49
Between those three things I try to figure out what might be going on.
12:58
It depends on where I am on a problem which approach I use.
13:06
You could discover things from models that you'd never get from observations
13:11
just because they force you to be rigorous about relationships.
13:20
You can find things out experimentally, but, if you do not bring those back into a
13:26
more synthetic, holistic science to figure out how they fit, you can be misled.
13:33
That's another thing I like to do.
13:36
I like to move between scales and levels to see how consistent a finding is.
13:47
That's probably coming from the modeling.
13:49
I want to know how this would apply into a bigger system.
13:57
I think I may be kind of unusual in that sense.
14:01
Some people are very comfortable being more reductionist
14:07
and other people are more comfortable being more holistic, sort of
14:13
big, hand-wavy relationships.
14:16
I think they both have strengths, so I like to move between them
14:20
to see how it all fits together.
14:27
Makes sense.
14:28
Incorporating almost moving back and forth between
14:34
the two.
14:34
I'm not sure they're great words for these, but a reductionist is someone
14:40
who's breaking it into smaller and smaller parts to find out what's really
14:45
going on, but it can also become finding out more and more about less and less.
14:56
I don't like that idea.
14:58
I'm not opposed to reductionism, but I always want to go more in a
15:01
synthetic direction, if I can, as well to figure out what we've missed
15:07
out, what have we failed to learn.
15:17
It's not just ecology where you find these things.
15:20
There can be things that are true at one level, but either
15:24
cancelled or counteracted by something else at a higher level.
15:33
"A" is true, but when you put it in a higher level, it's like, well, it's
15:38
just one of many possible outcomes.
15:41
It's not the only outcome.
15:43
We can't just simply add up everything and expect to know what's going on.
15:49
It's not an additive system.
15:52
Ecosystems and ecology that's another fascinating thing.
15:56
They're not additive systems.
15:59
If you approach it that way, you're not going to learn very much.
16:07
That's an interesting way to describe it.
16:10
So, does this relate then to the concept of emergent properties as well?
16:14
Yes, exactly, exactly.
16:17
There are things-it's not like they mysteriously appear.
16:21
It's just that without these higher-level interactions you
16:24
can't understand what's going on.
16:26
Sometimes the things are incredibly simple that lead to really complicated behaviors.
16:34
The fact like in mortality it acts in a complicated way because there's
16:39
always some event outside of your view that you're not considering that can
16:46
appear suddenly as this chaotic element.
16:49
Then
16:51
it's like, oh, well, it's just chaos.
16:54
No, not really.
16:55
It is probabilistic, which gives it a complexity.
17:00
It's the fact that there's always something outside that's eventually going
17:04
to race in and change the system on you in a way that you hadn't been anticipating.
17:13
This understanding, would you say that it's only recently emerged
17:17
within the field of ecology?
17:18
I know at one point in time people thought of ecosystems as very static, right?
17:25
Well, I suppose.
17:28
There was some formal development of emergent
17:33
properties.
17:34
There were a lot of discussions of that in the '60s and '70s when
17:38
ecosystems were first studied, because was it just elaborate
17:42
chemistry or something like that?
17:46
Well, yeah chemistry is involved, but more is going on than just pure chemistry.
17:52
There are interactions that lead to behaviors like lags and things
18:00
or a resistance to change, at least within certain limits.
18:04
But
18:07
I think the formal analysis was under the idea of biocomplexity and I think
18:14
that was more like the early 2000s
18:18
of biocomplexity and how things would emerge.
18:22
I was influenced very much by that thinking.
18:28
Who are some of the figures you can say that sort of led that?
18:28
Well, I think Wolfram
18:35
was in general someone who pushed that idea in science in general,
18:46
but certainly Bob O'Neill from the Oak Ridge National
18:50
Laboratory, Bob Gardner, those
18:56
folks pushed those ideas quite a bit.
19:02
Did they influence your scientific, philosophical
19:07
development as well would you say?
19:10
Well, to some degree.
19:12
I wouldn't say that Bob O'Neill says this and, therefore, it is, and I
19:17
must do this, but it made me realize that some of the explanations of why
19:25
ecosystems behaved one way at one level and another way at another higher level.
19:30
I was influenced by that a lot.
19:34
I realized
19:36
it explained some behaviors.
19:43
One example I like to show people is [that if] they're convinced that
19:46
when trees die, they can't store carbon, because they're decomposing.
19:51
That's true if you observe a tree dies over time it's going
19:55
to decompose and lose mass.
19:59
But if you look at a population of trees dying, and they die at different times,
20:06
some of the newly dead trees offset the losses of the old trees and actually that
20:12
pool can actually gain carbon over time.
20:15
It can store.
20:16
It can build up.
20:18
It can increase, even though the individuals are losing,
20:21
the population can increase.
20:24
To me, that's an emergent behavior.
20:27
It's fairly simple, but it's still hard for people to understand.
20:33
I've given people some puzzles, you know.
20:36
Suppose you have a function that goes like this [tilts forearm at an angle] . It's
20:40
going down, and a function that goes like that [tilts forearm to opposite direction]
20:43
. Well if you average them over the whole period, what's the average store of each?
20:48
Assuming that the high point was one?
20:51
It's a half.
20:53
For both of them.
20:54
It's completely independent of the direction.
21:00
There are a lot of areas where I've tried to apply my science that
21:04
I have to explain some of these
21:08
counterintuitive findings, because they really influence
21:13
how people think about systems.
21:19
Sometimes they're making completely the wrong conclusion.
21:27
It seems like really a relative finding too to current environmental
21:32
problems with climate change.
21:35
Yeah.
21:37
I think so.
21:42
Maybe in the sense that people realize that there's big changes over the
21:47
seasons, so, therefore, how could there be any systematic change?
21:55
But slight increases in each part or slight warming in each part of the
21:59
year can lead to an overall warming trend quite easily, even though
22:03
snowballs can be formed in parking lots,
22:10
which is sort of referencing [Senator] Inhofe's famous snowball in the senate.
22:14
You've already touched on this, but
22:21
just to reiterate-my next question is how would you describe your scientific style?
22:26
You used the term triangulation, right, to navigate between modeling, observational,
22:33
and experimental and not get stuck in one area over the other, is that correct?
22:40
No, it depends on where the science is.
22:44
The scientific method starts with, you know, observations often.
22:51
What is happening?
22:53
Let's just observe what is happening.
22:58
So, an example for us, me, where I recently made a discovery after 30
23:05
years plus of working on it, was tree mortality because when we started
23:12
measuring it it seemed completely chaotic.
23:15
Some plots had trees die, some didn't.
23:18
Sometimes there were huge amounts that died, sometimes small amounts.
23:24
We were convinced, if we had long-term measurements, we would eventually
23:29
get rid of all that noise-that we would finally get enough numbers in
23:34
a big enough area and a long enough period, we'd figure out the average
23:39
and then we could do our science.
23:42
Well, as we gathered those numbers what started to occur to me was, yeah,
23:48
we were getting a better average, but the variation never really went down.
23:54
Variability
23:56
was the key thing about mortality.
23:59
That was the key property.
24:01
It's variable.
24:03
It's variable at every scale you look at it.
24:12
By gathering that information, making those observations we could
24:15
then develop a hypothesis about what mortality was really like.
24:20
Then we demonstrated that by using that information to make models
24:25
to just show, we can only observe limited places for a limited time.
24:30
But if you take that information and apply it into a model what would
24:34
it look like if you could look at a big area or a long period of time?
24:40
It showed that we'd been thinking about mortality really
24:44
completely in the wrong way.
24:47
At least I think we have.
24:49
Now, that's a hypothesis which then can be tested probably with more
24:54
observation in the sense that some ecosystem phenomena are like astrophysics.
25:04
We can't move stars around, and we can't do experiments, but I would
25:09
argue that astrophysicists are probably some of the most rigorous
25:13
scientists you'll find on the planet.
25:17
The fact that they can't do a manipulative experiment doesn't
25:20
mean that they haven't learned anything or they're making it all up.
25:26
Anyways, that'd be an example where we went from observations and then
25:31
developed models and now, we have really the model is like I view as a
25:37
very sophisticated hypothesis and now we can try to test that maybe in a
25:45
different place than the Andrews, see if it applies somewhere else or not.
25:57
How have your disciplinary roots and your personal training in science influenced
26:03
the development of this approach?
26:09
I think I'm a generalist.
26:15
I have worked a lot in decomposition.
26:17
I know a lot about that, done a lot of studies on that, known for doing that, but
26:25
I'm really interested in communities and populations, in ecosystems, in landscapes.
26:33
I'm
26:35
interested in a whole series of different scales and relationships.
26:43
For years I had to deal with colleagues who believed, for example, that species,
26:48
which is more of a community level, could never influence ecosystem behavior.
26:55
I just thought that was ridiculous, because the properties of species
27:01
are different from each other.
27:04
Therefore, if the properties are different for the different
27:07
species and you change the mixture of species the properties change.
27:12
I mean, how could they not change?
27:17
I've always had in my carbon models a community-based model
27:23
that allows the species to change.
27:27
When I do experiments, I usually look at it over different species to see
27:32
if there are differences between them.
27:36
Some people are very comfortable, they just do ecosystem work.
27:39
That's all they do.
27:40
They don't think species are relevant.
27:42
There are some people who do community work.
27:45
That's all fine.
27:46
But I've found that I've worked at multiple levels and
27:54
I'm very comfortable doing that.
27:56
Some people are very uncomfortable when they get outside of
27:59
their narrow specialty.
28:01
I'm not that way at all.
28:05
I may not know what I'm doing, but I'm not afraid to think about things
28:09
at different levels and scales and trying to integrate all the processes
28:15
together to see how they work.
28:17
With that perspective that differs maybe from other people within the
28:24
Andrews community or even forest ecologists in general, how do you
28:28
think that being a generalist maybe has changed your perspective on ecosystems?
28:34
Or has given you insight that may not have been there, if you were
28:38
more of a specialist, so to speak?
28:41
Yeah, I think it's really because I'm willing to cross boundaries.
28:45
It allows me to see how things actually do cross boundaries and
28:51
how they influence behaviors.
28:53
I think that's what's
28:59
the key for me has been able to do that.
29:07
I think the other thing is I like to synthesize.
29:10
I like to put things together and not just do that, but do things like assess
29:19
uncertainty as we put things together.
29:23
A lot of folks are very happy and there's nothing wrong with it, but
29:28
I'm not happy to just learn more and more about less and less, and that
29:35
doesn't turn me on in the slightest.
29:37
This
29:40
might be an assumption, but I'm just curious-is moving across different
29:47
scales as a generalist do you think that's made you realize the
29:53
dynamic nature of ecosystems or the uncertainties more or has that sort
29:58
of help understand patterns more?
30:00
I don't know if that made sense.
30:02
I think it's helped me understand everything more.
30:05
Everything, okay.
30:08
I still have a lot to learn.
30:11
It's filled out the whole thing.
30:16
You know there are some people [who] like just experiments, they won't accept any
30:20
science that's not experimental based.
30:23
I think that's like looking at an object from one direction only.
30:29
I just question how you can understand what the object is unless you look at
30:34
it at least several ways, and I likely look at it at least three ways and
30:39
maybe, if you think about the scale aspects, it's not only three sides,
30:46
but looking up and looking down.
30:48
I like to look at it from every direction I can to see if I can
30:54
get any idea what's going on.
30:57
I just think it gives you a much stronger view and you can find inconsistencies
31:03
when you do that that you'd never find otherwise, I don't think.
31:12
I think that comes from being more of a generalist, using a wide [view] , multiple
31:18
tools, looking at different processes.
31:20
Even though I'm really interested in ecosystems, I've always wondered
31:26
how populations, well how these other things affect that ecosystem.
31:38
What is your strategy in developing a research question?
31:41
You a little bit touched on this already, but if you can maybe describe or answer
31:46
explicitly how you go about doing that.
31:49
Well, the first thing would be to assess the state of the science.
31:54
What does it need to improve?
31:56
Does it need observations?
31:58
Does it need-so if there's not much information, I think you just have
32:02
to start with making observations.
32:04
What does the system do?
32:05
How does it act?
32:08
What seems to be influencing it?
32:11
But, in some cases, we know all that.
32:14
In fact, we know an awful lot, so I might start with a model that
32:20
has all the knowledge that we use.
32:24
I know you had a question about modeling, but much of ecological
32:28
modeling has become statistical modeling.
32:32
I'm not talking about it, something we derive from data per se.
32:38
I'm talking about something we derive from knowledge.
32:41
We know that these things happen.
32:44
They happen there must be a way that they relate to each other.
32:48
Okay, can we put that into a model and then predict?
32:53
I recently sent out a manuscript into a journal.
32:58
They asked could I give a perspective on dead trees and their biochemical function.
33:07
I said, sure I'll do that.
33:09
I thought about a whole series of processes and I created little
33:13
models all on spreadsheets.
33:15
What were the relationships here?
33:18
One of the reviewers wrote back and said I was a little disappointed you didn't have
33:22
any cartoons showing what was going on.
33:25
What I did is I created mathematical models of what was going on, which I
33:30
thought was a lot more rigorous, but some people they just don't do that.
33:36
The want cartoons.
33:38
If I can make a mathematical relationship, I do because it's
33:43
very specific and explicit.
33:46
I have to decide what's in and what's out and what's the relationship and all that.
33:52
If I don't know all the parameter values, well, I'll just use a range
33:55
to see, if it changes, how the system will act and that leads to questions
34:01
about okay, well, then you know maybe we need to look at this now.
34:06
Maybe that's-now we need these sets of observations.
34:11
That's how it works for me.
34:13
Maybe I need observations.
34:15
Maybe I kind of know what's going on.
34:18
I can make a model.
34:19
Then I make predictions.
34:21
Some of them are qualitative, but they could be, you could do experiments or
34:26
make observations that would then confirm that it's at least on the right track.
34:38
That's just how-and maybe something needs an experiment.
34:43
I'm a little less enthralled with experiments in ecosystems because
34:50
we often fail to control for some key variable, and it messes up the
34:55
results or things don't act the way that we thought they would.
35:02
It's not that it couldn't act that way.
35:04
We just didn't believe it would and then it did, and our experiment is like, meh,
35:11
didn't pan out.
35:11
There's a lot of experiments that don't pan out in ecosystems.
35:15
It's less applicable.
35:18
Well, you know, an example-there are sites that have done a lot of
35:23
experiments in LTER, so you can.
35:25
But our forests are really large trees.
35:30
There was a proposal to do climate alternations.
35:33
We were supposed to build these 80-meter-tall by 100
35:38
meter by 100-meter greenhouses.
35:42
Then it was pointed out that all we had to have was one tree which
35:47
probably weighs 50 tons fall into the greenhouse and the experiment is over.
35:54
How on earth can you, you know [shrugs] , it's almost an
35:58
uncontrollable system that way.
36:01
But there's things you can do, experiments.
36:03
It's just that
36:07
a lot of times experiments are hard to carry out in our system or they introduce
36:14
changes that we weren't anticipating that totally screw up the interpretation.
36:22
So, [shrugs] experiment as you can, but just be aware that that's
36:26
not a silver bullet necessarily.
36:30
For
36:35
my next question, what are your thoughts in regards to
36:39
objectivity in scientific research?
36:43
Oh, well, I think the objectivity is limited.
36:49
It's not-let me put it this way - there's a scientific ideal of total objectivity.
36:57
If it was carried out by robots, that might be achievable, but
37:04
it's carried out by people.
37:06
They have biases.
37:09
Some of them are severe and
37:14
ecologists, scientists have biases, too.
37:16
If they believe they don't have any biases, then I think they're
37:20
deluded, to put it in a word.
37:24
Now we want to recognize when we have a bias, we want to counter it in
37:29
some way, but I've noticed in talking with people and reviewing articles,
37:36
manuscripts, and proposals for research that there has been some real bias.
37:43
I just reviewed a manuscript in which they looked at how changing forests
37:51
management would affect carbon stores.
37:54
That's an area I work a lot in.
37:57
Well, their model, very sophisticated, only included the live trees
38:03
and only the above-ground part.
38:05
Well, there are roots and soil and dead stuff and then, when you harvest a forest,
38:10
you create products that store carbon.
38:12
They had none of that.
38:15
They analyzed the question and they made these conclusions and they didn't
38:22
even qualify that, oh, well, we had these other pools that we ignored.
38:27
They just said it was this way and it won't be the way they describe and then
38:32
in their discussion they went on and on about how they could improve their model
38:36
of this little teeny fraction of the system they decided was the whole thing.
38:42
It was like-they were so biased; it was incredible, and they couldn't see it,
38:50
because they were being super rigorous about their little part of the world
38:55
and they could make it even better, but the idea that you have to back
39:01
off and see that there's more to it.
39:03
For example, they said, if we just grew the forest for a longer period of time,
39:08
we'd store more carbon in the forest.
39:10
Well, that's true.
39:13
But we'd store less in products and the atmosphere perceives what's going on
39:19
on the products versus the ecosystem.
39:21
They both store.
39:23
If one goes up and the other goes down and vice versa, it doesn't
39:27
mean that there's more storage.
39:29
But that's what they concluded.
39:32
Because in my mind they're just so into their tunnel vision
39:37
it's creating all these biases.
39:41
I would say, yeah, it's full of it.
39:45
Same thing with-I worked a lot on dead trees.
39:48
You wouldn't believe how many people still can't, scientists can't envision
39:53
that there are dead trees in a forest.
39:57
When I wrote this review article, this commentary review article, I had to point
40:01
out you know trees have been around 340 million years and when the first tree
40:08
died there were dead trees in the world.
40:12
Only 340 million years ago and you're saying that we're just discovering this?
40:19
Does that make any sense?
40:21
I do it to make people laugh because it's just logically insane how do
40:28
intelligent people continue to do this?
40:34
You can't explain it through bias and lack of objectivity.
40:43
It's something we have to be aware of-anything done by people is going
40:46
to have bias and lack objectivity.
40:48
We're just trying to maximize the objectivity and science to the degree
40:53
that our human nature allows us to do it.
40:58
Would you say then that recognizing it can help us to sort of overcome
41:04
it by being conscious of it?
41:06
Absolutely.
41:07
I think that's how humans deal with things.
41:11
When we realize that we-what our nature is, we have to sit and say
41:18
now wait a minute before rushing to a conclusion I should reconsider that.
41:23
I think that's true with human relationships, and, say, diversity.
41:29
You may have a reaction to something, but you should then think, well,
41:36
that's just me being stupid here.
41:39
Okay, let's actually think of what's going on versus what we instantaneously
41:47
conclude because of our biases.
41:52
Scientists have a problem, because we believe we're objective we've
41:59
created a barrier because we've basically said, "Well, I couldn't be
42:03
biased." How could I be subjective?
42:07
But no, we are.
42:13
I'm sure, too, we've been talking on the individual level, but when you
42:16
also talk on the social and political level with funding availability that
42:21
also plays a huge role, I assume.
42:23
Absolutely, because people want to fund what they do, what they work on,
42:28
then they recognize the value of it.
42:31
Sometimes there's a competition, let's not publish that, we have
42:36
that idea too or something.
42:38
That sort of pettiness comes out.
42:40
But some of it is just their enthusiasm about what they recognize is much higher
42:47
than the stuff that they don't recognize.
42:51
That leads to this sort of creation of silos in tracks that just get
42:57
deeper and deeper and deeper without stepping back and saying look, you
43:02
know, there's 8 tracks here we have to pursue to get at integrated knowledge
43:07
and we're on one of them or two of them.
43:13
That's why I think
43:16
it helps to look and synthesize because you realize what's missing.
43:22
What have we missed here in our pursuit of knowledge?
43:27
That's largely driven from the fact that the science tends to, there's
43:33
a hot idea or an area where people are trained or they're familiar with
43:38
and they just keep plowing in that direction as long as you'll let them go.
43:45
I think that's just a human tendency.
43:52
As a researcher, how do you use the scientific method to find truth?
43:58
Well, first of all, you have to be very skeptical, even of your
44:04
own conclusions, if you want the truth, because of this issue of you
44:13
can start to confirm things that you've seen, but not try to falsify them.
44:19
So that's one method.
44:22
You're always trying to falsify the idea, not just confirm that you can see it
44:30
somewhere else, but you know is this real?
44:34
Can we find evidence that counters this?
44:41
Are there lots of exceptions that just indicate that did happen, but it's
44:48
just one of many possible outcomes?
44:51
That's
44:54
one approach.
44:55
Skepticism is really important and not only about others'
45:02
ideas, but even your own ideas.
45:08
You're constantly looking and searching and checking to see
45:11
what are the logical and factual inconsistencies that we're seeing.
45:19
Unfortunately, because ecosystems are somewhat idiosyncratic, it's
45:25
really hard to come up with general relationships or conclusions.
45:32
I wouldn't say relationships.
45:36
We know plants grow everywhere and they die everywhere, and they decompose
45:40
everywhere, and they do this and that.
45:42
We just know that.
45:46
But whether that system is going to gain a lot of carbon or lose a lot of
45:50
carbon or whatever, we might not know
46:06
that.
46:06
I guess,
46:09
to reiterate, remaining skeptical and always looking for the ways in
46:13
which one might be wrong, right?
46:17
Yeah, being open to that and always searching.
46:24
Looking for relationships that are truly general.
46:29
I think they exist, but you know some of them seem very mundane and so that's
46:38
another bias that scientists have.
46:41
We're much happier with a very exciting and new fresh result
46:47
that seems to turn over the conventional wisdom, cutting edge.
46:56
There's all kinds of stuff like that.
46:58
I'm very skeptical whenever I hear any of that language.
47:04
I think a lot of that just reflects our society.
47:07
We're into novelty.
47:08
We're into technology.
47:09
We're into
47:12
various things.
47:14
You can see it in the science.
47:16
Sometimes you don't need technology to solve a question.
47:20
Sometimes you can't answer it without it.
47:24
It really depends on the context.
47:31
Are there laws of nature and if so, can you define what a law of nature means?
47:37
Well, I think there's a scientific definition of a law and that's kind
47:41
of what I would go towards which would be a phenomenon that is very well
47:47
understood and documented, and it always behaves the way that is predicted.
47:55
There aren't very many laws in science,
48:00
real laws.
48:01
I mean, there's the laws of thermodynamics but even some of those, like the
48:06
conservation of mass law, which I use a lot in my science, has some
48:13
exceptions, you know, with radioactive decay and that sort of thing where
48:17
mass can be turned into energy.
48:19
Well, it's not strictly
48:24
observed in all situations, but there are lots of situations
48:28
in which mass is conserved.
48:30
I'd say that's a law.
48:33
I will use those, like in my carbon science.
48:36
It's one of the fundamental things I always start from and what's
48:40
really weird is I find results and predictions that don't square
48:44
with the conservation of mass law.
48:46
That really bothers me.
48:49
Ecology, when you get down to ecology, I'm not sure there are many laws.
48:54
There's been a great attempt to create them, to discover them,
49:03
not much success there,
49:08
but it does conform to certain laws, like conservation of mass.
49:13
To me, it's sort of almost like the highest level of scientific
49:18
knowledge and predictability.
49:20
That's a law and a theory is below that,
49:30
like a theory of evolution by natural selection.
49:34
It's not some wild-ass guess.
49:38
It's not the common place thought of a theory.
49:40
A theory means that there's a lot of observation, experimental evidence.
49:46
There are
49:51
mathematical models.
49:52
All kinds of lines all lined up predicting the same thing.
50:02
As a scientist, what are your overall motivations?
50:05
Is yours curiosity driven?
50:08
Is it for finding real-world solutions?
50:12
How would you describe the purpose or motivations behind
50:14
your work as a scientist?
50:16
Well, it's a combination.
50:19
I mean, I am really interested in discovery and thinking
50:25
about how we discover things.
50:28
I have about a year maybe year and a half discussion with a friend who's a musician.
50:37
We talk about every week and one of our primary things that we talk about is
50:43
discovery and how does he discover things and how do I discover things and how
50:49
do we just go about discovering things?
50:51
That's part of what motivates me is discovering how do I discover things?
50:57
Come up with new ideas.
51:00
To go back a little bit, we talked about, well, where do you start on a problem?
51:07
One area is not only what is known, but what are the clichés about
51:11
what's going on, how it works and then reexamine those clichés to see
51:18
what are the holes in those things?
51:21
What have they missed out?
51:23
Anyway, to me discovery's a big motivation.
51:27
I do like to learn things.
51:32
I do this in music and in woodworking, fishing.
51:39
I go fishing.
51:41
I'm always trying to figure out how to be better and never formulaic, just trying to
51:48
figure out what's-that motivates me a lot.
51:52
For the carbon work, I've tried to always think about how it could be
51:58
applied and tried to explain it to people who might become practitioners.
52:06
I've never been an applied scientist, as someone who's said, "This is a
52:11
problem I have to come up with this applied solution." That's never
52:16
motivated me at all, but I have wanted to have my stuff applied.
52:22
Now, I'm not sure it's really worked out.
52:28
I've had some real questions about my carbon work in part because
52:34
it's gotten really political and
52:39
it's been really hard to actually have the truth come out or at
52:44
least the basic principles.
52:46
It's just so warped by what people want that I've become kind of discouraged about
52:55
doing that work.
52:56
I do still some, but it's sort of like oh my word.
53:00
It's
53:03
one of those fields where people have already decided what they want to do
53:06
and then they justify it under carbon.
53:10
I've given talks on this where people developing these carbon bombs, they're
53:15
assembling them and dropping them on each other to show how they're
53:18
management is just a travesty.
53:21
If they don't do it my way, we won't get all this carbon stored.
53:28
I've tried to point out that, if everybody's right, then we can do
53:32
anything to forests we want to and they'll store carbon if we just
53:36
accept what everyone says, so clearly the forest would be irrelevant.
53:42
Is that what's going on?
53:44
Or somebody is really telling tales, and that's not going to help the
53:49
field either, because who would trust a field in which a major group
53:54
has mislead so many for so long?
53:56
I don't know.
53:59
We just had an election where that may have occurred.
54:02
I don't know.
54:08
If we can go back for a minute, because I'm interested in your reflections
54:13
on talking with your friend who is a musician and what that's-the
54:17
conversations back and forth.
54:18
Do you mind describing a little bit more about what that's taught you
54:21
in terms of discovery and learning things in a little bit more detail?
54:26
This sort of came from work with-Fred Swanson has encouraged us to work with
54:32
the humanities and artists and I did a project where basically the artists did
54:39
all the work, but I tried to encourage them to think about dead trees or what
54:43
they might mean or how they'd represent them because they realized that just
54:48
telling people scientific facts may not convince people to rethink what they're
54:56
thinking, change how they view the world.
55:00
Anyways, it's kind of along those lines.
55:03
How
55:05
to get out of the track of, you know, activity A is this and this
55:11
and this and this-it's only that.
55:14
That's like, well that's a replication of something and maybe you do really well
55:19
at replicating it or not, but how do you do something that hasn't been replicated?
55:24
That's just new?
55:25
How do you actually come up with a new thought?
55:29
At that level, music and science-it's just human thought, really.
55:36
That's what I've tried to generalize it to.
55:40
It's kind of under the idea that humans, many humans anyway, or certainly enough,
55:49
what really drives them is discovery.
55:52
They want to find out something new.
55:56
That's true for someone who's painting or making music or
56:00
doing science or writing a novel
56:05
or thinking about philosophy.
56:07
That's just for a certain number of people that is really the motivator.
56:14
What's behind all that?
56:18
He's a little less sure of himself scientifically, so a lot of our
56:24
experiments involve music where he's very sure of himself and I'm a little less,
56:29
but it enables us to think about that.
56:34
How do we go at that?
56:42
Here's an idea I guess I didn't describe earlier: when I'm thinking
56:48
about something often, I just lie down and envision it in my head.
56:53
I don't think "I'm a scientist. I'm rigorous." I just lay back
56:58
and [think] , what is happening?
57:00
How does it happen?
57:00
Can I envision what's going on or what must be going on?
57:06
I try to, sometimes I just brute force I'm going to figure this out,
57:12
but a lot of times it's like, "Let's just relax and just let the brain
57:18
cook in the background and let's not get uptight about discovering
57:23
something. Something can appear."
57:26
The same thing about music, say a rhythm.
57:32
We have certain conventions of rhythms, but if we just relax them out, well,
57:40
this is an example of 4/4 time.
57:43
Well, why can't we have 5/4 time?
57:45
7/4 time?
57:47
11/4 time?
57:49
I mean, we do not have to have 3 or 4/4 time.
58:00
That's an example I guess musically of just he'll often sit at the
58:05
piano and he'll just hit random notes and actually it sounds great.
58:10
If you transcribed it, it would be like what the hell is that?
58:13
But he plays it with such confidence and when he finds a note at the end
58:18
that he just really, boom, that note, and it's like wow, that sounded great.
58:22
What was that?
58:29
It's been real fun discussion.
58:33
I think that's what motivates me is this discovery.
58:36
That's great.
58:38
It goes to show that I think maybe a public's view misses out
58:42
a lot on is the creativity that can go on behind science as well.
58:47
Yeah, sometimes it's just putting standard things together and you
58:51
get oh yeah, that's a result.
58:53
But sometimes it's like
58:56
you might have all-so, an analogy with music would be
59:03
you know you might know many of the chords and the theory and the rhythms, but
59:04
you've learned all that, you've practiced it but then you just let it go and that
59:08
guides you, but it doesn't hold you back.
59:10
Science would be like you learn all
59:20
the physics and chemistry and this and that,
59:24
you learn all these tools, that's fine.
59:28
But then you have to get to the space where you just let it rip.
59:34
You grab what you need.
59:36
That's kind of what I've described.
59:37
I take what I need to make the thing work, or at least start to make it work.
59:47
Awesome.
59:48
That concludes our first section.
59:51
However, we are at the hour.
59:53
Well, that's fine.
59:55
We can keep going.
59:56
Would you like to take just a couple minute break?
59:59
I don't need a break.
1:00:00
If you need one, I'm happy to take one.
1:00:03
Okay, I might take a couple minutes if that's okay and then we can-
1:00:06
That's fine.
1:00:07
I'll pause the recording.
1:00:08
Okay.
1:00:17
Moving on to the next section, I'll inquire about different traditions
1:00:21
and approaches of science on a community level and what role these
1:00:24
different approaches contribute to the Andrews science community as a whole.
1:00:29
My first question is what role does natural history play in
1:00:34
the Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:00:38
I think it plays a very important role.
1:00:41
I have a colleague who pointed out that, well, let me tell this
1:00:45
story-I went to Amherst College and I applied as a natural history major.
1:00:52
When I arrived, they'd done away with it.
1:00:55
The reason I applied, was because I wanted to become an ecologist and that was
1:01:00
really what ecology was, natural history.
1:01:03
But they didn't think it was a rigorous science, so they stuck me in physics
1:01:06
and chemistry and finally biology.
1:01:08
The first year or two were just miserable.
1:01:12
It's not what I wanted.
1:01:16
Natural history is really important because it is the basis
1:01:20
of ecology, ecological science.
1:01:22
It's kind of where it began.
1:01:25
It's kind of where it's grounded.
1:01:28
It's not that it's just
1:01:31
telling stories but there's a strong relationship to making observations of
1:01:41
the natural system and telling people.
1:01:45
But the other thing that is important, I guess now that I've said telling stories,
1:01:50
is one of the things that has made
1:01:55
the HJ Andrews work with so many disciplines was the ability to tell each
1:02:01
other stories and I'm not sure, and I haven't been involved too much in the
1:02:08
science in the last years with retirement, but that's always been a key part and
1:02:16
in telling those stories you need to make things more
1:02:19
general and cross disciplinary.
1:02:23
I think it's helped both because that's the basis of the science
1:02:27
generally but also because it's helped bridge these communities where
1:02:33
you can tell each other stories.
1:02:35
Now some people enjoy the different stories and some people don't.
1:02:39
That's fine.
1:02:41
But if you're willing to listen and enjoy, learn from them, you can learn
1:02:45
an awful lot about the system through that kind of communication mode.
1:02:54
For
1:02:56
example, the people who work in the aquatic system would describe what they're
1:03:04
observing in that system and then the people in the uplands would listen and
1:03:10
they would learn and sometimes they copied things, but it really was a major way of
1:03:17
trying to get a bigger community working versus really narrow, we're just working
1:03:26
on this little problem and everybody talks the same way about the same thing.
1:03:32
In this community you'd hear stories from the water people and
1:03:39
stories from the soil people, right?
1:03:40
And the climate, yeah.
1:03:43
Now the humanities and philosophy and social sciences and sometimes you know
1:03:51
it doesn't always make sense or whatever, but that's where this realization, oh
1:03:57
just because I don't study it doesn't mean it isn't important or they don't have
1:04:02
something to add here, so I should check myself when I start having those thoughts.
1:04:09
Sometimes they're valid, but sometimes they're not.
1:04:12
They're just, okay that's what I-I really like certain kinds of food
1:04:18
and if that isn't served to me, you know, I'm upset, but it doesn't mean
1:04:25
that what's served to me isn't good.
1:04:31
What role do observational approaches play at the Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:04:39
It's huge in several ways.
1:04:42
One is because the system is hard to manipulate-you can do
1:04:49
it, but we're kind of limited.
1:04:50
We observe the system and see how it changes in response to
1:04:50
various things that are kind of
1:05:02
thrown at it.
1:05:05
The other thing is that a lot of the underlying processes, you
1:05:12
can't measure for a year or two and conclude what's going on.
1:05:16
I mean you have to keep measuring the climate.
1:05:18
You have to keep measuring, you know, how the trees are
1:05:24
growing and dying and all that.
1:05:26
We just had two watersheds that had fires go through them.
1:05:31
Because we have all those pre-measurements of what was going
1:05:34
on [and then] something comes in, now we can assess what that has done.
1:05:41
How has that changed the system if we-typically what happens is people
1:05:48
just, when something happens, they go and measure it, but you don't know what
1:05:52
happened before, so how did it change?
1:05:56
It's hard to determine that question.
1:05:59
A lot of that comes from just making observations of key
1:06:02
things and continuing them,
1:06:06
observing and assessing, but then opportunities will appear that changes the
1:06:12
system in some way and then you can start learning what's controlling the system.
1:06:18
I think they're really key.
1:06:22
They're not the only thing one should do but probably at least half,
1:06:27
three-quarters of the Andrews work is maintaining long-term measurements
1:06:37
and some people gripe about that because there should be more work
1:06:39
on experiments and sexy new things.
1:06:42
That's true.
1:06:44
There's no reason not to do that, but having some of these records
1:06:49
has turned out to be super important and led to new discoveries.
1:06:57
That was one of my follow-up questions, I think, is an underlying philosophy of
1:07:00
Andrews Forest community is long-term frameworks, and so that heavily correlates
1:07:05
with observational approaches, right?
1:07:08
Well, it's that, but also, you know, at least the LTER has
1:07:15
been oriented around a question.
1:07:18
The question is unanswerable, which for scientists is like what?
1:07:24
But Phil Sollins years and years ago said you know what we should do is organize
1:07:30
our work around a question that would take us 50 to 100 years to answer or
1:07:36
maybe we would never answer it, but it would motivate us and focus us for the
1:07:42
long-term period versus like LTER6 [sixth funding cycle, which come in 6 year
1:07:47
increments] would answer this question.
1:07:47
Then LTER, whatever, LTER7 [seventh funding cycle] will answer this question.
1:07:53
Instead, it's been like well, we have this set of questions.
1:07:56
It's really general, and what we'll do in each phase is we'll grab a different part
1:08:03
and we'll try to answer that, and we'll now put that in our bag of knowledge,
1:08:11
and then we'll go on to the next part.
1:08:15
Landscape dynamics was an emphasis at one point because we hadn't really
1:08:19
thought about how the landscape works.
1:08:22
We spent six years just thinking, how does it work?
1:08:25
Now when we talk about our science we often talk about the landscape.
1:08:32
The climate work now is very landscape-based versus what's
1:08:37
happening at a weather station.
1:08:40
The response of birds is really a landscape-level examination of what's
1:08:48
going on and how they're moving from one part to another or whatever.
1:08:53
That influenced the thinking.
1:09:00
We have these questions that are designed to be long-term that actually
1:09:06
keep things together, provide a
1:09:12
focal point, even if it's kind of vague.
1:09:14
It's still a focal point.
1:09:17
It's been a real strength in almost every time the Andrews LTER get reviewed, they
1:09:23
get high marks because of that, I think.
1:09:26
It's just this underlying strength in commitment to long-term, not
1:09:35
only measurements, but discovery.
1:09:45
I'm interested, too-the general sense that I get when I read about the history
1:09:49
of ecology and, correct me if I'm wrong, is it seems like natural history,
1:09:53
or at least I've heard some people express that natural history has been
1:09:56
pushed to the backburner a little bit.
1:09:59
But that doesn't seem to be the case within the Andrews Forest community.
1:10:03
Is that right?
1:10:04
It still carries a lot of importance?
1:10:08
Yeah, maybe that's so.
1:10:10
I mean what happened is that, because there was such a descriptive nature,
1:10:16
natural history basis of it, there was a real challenge of how do we
1:10:21
make ecology more quantitative?
1:10:26
There were several ways that his could happen, one was through simulation
1:10:30
models, which I kind of like because I look at them as really synthesis
1:10:36
tools and knowledge enhancement tools.
1:10:41
But, that's kind of still a little vague, so what's happened in a lot of
1:10:47
ecology, not only has it narrowed its focus into narrower and narrower tracks,
1:10:53
but without a lot of synthesis, but it's tended to go to statistical analysis and
1:10:59
modeling, really detailed statistics of data sets to discover what's going on.
1:11:09
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
1:11:11
I worked as a community ecologist and that's what you do.
1:11:13
You'd gather all this data, analyze it to figure out the
1:11:17
patterns of the communities.
1:11:18
It was really a fishing expedition, but didn't mean
1:11:23
that it didn't result in anything.
1:11:26
But it's become-modeling has become statistical modeling only.
1:11:34
I used to teach a course and we did modeling, and the students would always
1:11:38
say, "Well, where's the data that I model from?" I had a lecture specifically on I
1:11:45
now give you permission to use knowledge.
1:11:48
You may now use knowledge and apply it.
1:11:51
You have permission.
1:11:52
You don't need any data.
1:11:54
You just need knowledge of relationships and maybe data will be useful to test
1:12:00
your model or to run your model, whatever.
1:12:03
We're not doing a gigantic regression of behavior.
1:12:09
We actually know what's happening, how things relate to each other.
1:12:15
Put it together and see how it behaves.
1:12:19
But ecology has really become super statistical and super empirical
1:12:28
to the degree where you can read manuscripts, and I review a lot of
1:12:34
manuscripts, and I'm damned if I can figure out if there's a story.
1:12:38
There's no story.
1:12:39
It's a bunch of statistics.
1:12:42
It's like,
1:12:44
I think what's been lost is that humans in general relate to stories.
1:12:49
Jerry Franklin used to tell me that when you write a paper you've
1:12:54
got to decide what your story is because humans want to hear a story.
1:13:00
Now it doesn't have to be total B.S., made up stuff.
1:13:06
But inherently that's what it is.
1:13:08
For some people the story really is I had some data, I did a lot
1:13:14
of statistical analysis, I found out a bunch of significant things.
1:13:19
To me, it's like-oh, wow.
1:13:23
Okay.
1:13:24
Whatever.
1:13:27
What is it that you found?
1:13:29
I just still don't know what you found.
1:13:33
Or you have this dilemma where you know people are trying to explain the
1:13:37
last 5% of something, but they forgot about what controls the other 95%.
1:13:42
It's like, "Okay.
1:13:44
That's great.
1:13:44
What about the rest?
1:13:46
Do you ever think about that?" I tend to be a little skeptical about how
1:13:53
we've gotten to be more quantitative, at the expense of telling stories
1:14:00
and actually the natural history.
1:14:02
I don't know if other scientists at the Andrews feel that way.
1:14:05
That's just how I feel.
1:14:07
How did your students respond in the lecture when you give them
1:14:10
permission to just use knowledge?
1:14:13
"Oh, yeah. I guess so." Because I pointed out like, you know, if you have all
1:14:19
these studies where you find all these facts, do you mean you always have to
1:14:25
keep finding different facts or whatever?
1:14:27
You just pile up on the facts pile and we never look at the pile to
1:14:32
figure out which ones could we use?
1:14:36
That doesn't make sense, does it?
1:14:38
But it's the only course they often got at OSU where they were
1:14:43
given that kind of permission.
1:14:49
What about hypothesis-driven experimental research?
1:14:53
How does that contribute to the Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:14:57
I think probably, compared to many LTERs, it's more limited.
1:15:02
I think some of it has been just the ability to really manipulate
1:15:09
at the ecosystems level.
1:15:11
Now, studying sub-processes, little things, you can probably
1:15:16
fare better at doing that.
1:15:19
I wouldn't dismiss it.
1:15:21
But it's been a real challenge because of the scale of the system.
1:15:24
If you look at a lot of experiments at the Andrews, there've been things like
1:15:29
clearcutting watersheds or partial cuts.
1:15:34
You know there haven't been a lot of big, manipulative experiments
1:15:37
because they're hard to pull off.
1:15:41
We did try to do some.
1:15:44
We proposed that we would burn up a watershed.
1:15:47
There was a Phoenix Project we were going to light a fire at the base of a watershed
1:15:51
and burn up the forest the best we could.
1:15:54
See what would happen.
1:15:55
But it was like, well, nobody was really interested in actually doing that.
1:16:00
The managers were, they were game, but they did point out that, if this thing
1:16:04
gets away this would be a disaster.
1:16:07
So, it collapsed.
1:16:10
We haven't had as many big system experiments recently that
1:16:15
would be formal experiments.
1:16:18
Hypotheses are really important.
1:16:20
They're always important, but the trouble is a lot of hypotheses are just, you
1:16:28
know, I think this is going to happen.
1:16:30
To me, that's not a hypothesis.
1:16:32
There are a lot of pretty lousy hypotheses.
1:16:39
I think first of all, they have to be falsifiable.
1:16:43
Sometimes people have hypotheses that they know can't be wrong,
1:16:47
because they don't want to be wrong.
1:16:49
It has to be
1:16:53
falsifiable.
1:16:54
It has to be mechanistic, to me, to be a real-so someone once told me, if
1:16:59
a hypothesis doesn't have "if", then, because-if we do this, then the following
1:17:07
should happen because of this mechanism.
1:17:11
If it doesn't have those three things in it, it's really a crap hypothesis.
1:17:17
A lot of hypotheses I've reviewed through the years, they're just crap.
1:17:22
Sorry.
1:17:22
They don't have any of those elements.
1:17:26
You have to have---anyways, the other problem is the hypotheses
1:17:34
have to be in the traditional sense very strict, narrow things.
1:17:40
It's not bad, but it limits them.
1:17:45
I've made the argument that these mechanistic models that we create, they
1:17:50
are kind of very elaborate hypotheses that have all these relationships, not just
1:17:57
one, but multiples that are integrated.
1:18:00
A good process model is really a complex, higher-level hypothesis.
1:18:11
Even if it predicts things, that doesn't mean it's right.
1:18:13
It's just making a more elaborate, you know, complex prediction
1:18:20
than a simple hypothesis
1:18:27
would give.
1:18:27
But most people are still back at the let's just deal with limited hypotheses.
1:18:33
But if you try to look at a system like the Andrews at the biggest
1:18:36
level, those tend to break down.
1:18:40
They become overly simplistic and they just will not work, in my opinion,
1:18:47
where you have to have a much more complicated set of relationships.
1:18:54
I think it's key.
1:18:57
It's a key tool in science, hypothesis, and testing them
1:19:01
any way you can is important.
1:19:04
It may not be an experiment, but it's important to test them
1:19:10
and keep poking holes at them.
1:19:15
What about ecosystem modeling and modeling in general within
1:19:18
the Andrews Forest community?
1:19:20
Well, most of it's statistical modeling because that's what ecologists do.
1:19:24
I mean, that's how they have it and I've tried to push people into
1:19:28
more process, mechanistic modeling but with rather limited success.
1:19:35
A lot of people are just not comfortable doing that.
1:19:38
They feel very comfortable tied to data.
1:19:43
I understand that.
1:19:44
When people say, I have a professor said you know, screw the data.
1:19:50
Just create a model of relationships.
1:19:56
You say, oh, but it's not tied to data.
1:19:58
Well, it's tied to knowledge.
1:20:00
If
1:20:03
the point is generating knowledge, then why can't we use the knowledge?
1:20:09
But I think a lot of people are comfortable with empirical models.
1:20:14
I've pushed them for years to come up with climate models which actually had,
1:20:17
you know, like temperature models that had movement of air masses and that
1:20:22
kind of thing, real mechanisms of it.
1:20:25
They've kind of gone in that direction, but it's still kind of
1:20:29
correlational-based models based on data.
1:20:33
That's
1:20:36
what they feel comfortable doing and they're getting a lot from it.
1:20:42
The nice thing about processes is you can look at novel things.
1:20:46
Things that are outside of data.
1:20:48
I think that's what my professor was trying to tell me years ago
1:20:54
is there's the data you have and then there's the data you don't have.
1:20:59
Models can sometimes predict the data you don't have, whereas an empirical
1:21:05
relationship, it'll only predict the data that you have, unless the data that
1:21:09
you don't have is just like the data
1:21:13
you have.
1:21:13
The odds of that in ecology are pretty low.
1:21:18
Are there other people that have taken that route outside
1:21:21
of the Andrews Forest community?
1:21:24
Of, you mean modeling?
1:21:27
With processing?
1:21:29
Oh yeah, but there's very few in the field.
1:21:33
There was a time in ecosystem science that a lot of people were
1:21:38
modeling and working in models.
1:21:40
I mean a lot of it started through modeling.
1:21:45
Then what happened was there are big questions about processes that were
1:21:50
in those models and so what's happened I think was scientists became more
1:21:55
focused on studying the subprocesses and they lost view of the synthesis.
1:22:01
This is how they got into these more narrow tracks-hey, I'll become this.
1:22:05
I'll look at all the details of this process, but the mechanisms
1:22:12
to bring it back to the general level have largely been lost.
1:22:18
There are people who work on global change, for example, who tend to be
1:22:24
modelers because that's just something you have to approach through modeling,
1:22:28
but once you get below that level there aren't a lot of process modelers anymore.
1:22:34
Actually, people work in ecosystem science, a lot of them aren't
1:22:38
even ecosystem scientists.
1:22:40
They're sub-process ecosystem scientists.
1:22:44
That's all they are.
1:22:46
They're doing great science, but to me it's like what does it add up to?
1:22:50
I always have that question: what does that add up to?
1:23:00
And so, we've talked about natural history, observational,
1:23:04
hypothesis-driven, experimental, and modeling-are there other approaches to
1:23:09
ecological research other than those that are sort of in the cracks or in
1:23:14
between that we haven't talked about?
1:23:17
Well,
1:23:22
I guess in this sense.
1:23:24
I think those are the basic things with strict, traditional
1:23:28
ecosystem science would be.
1:23:30
But if we truly want to understand what's going on in ecosystems, we have
1:23:34
to figure out what humans are doing.
1:23:38
For a long time, ecosystem science just worked in systems
1:23:43
where humans didn't influence it.
1:23:46
Although, let's face, it humans have influenced about everything.
1:23:50
But there are places where that influence was very minimal.
1:23:53
I started that way, too.
1:23:55
Let's go into old-growth forests or natural areas.
1:23:59
It's fine.
1:24:00
It's interesting.
1:24:01
But then, when I got into the carbon work, I had to work with, well,
1:24:06
people are harvesting these forests and this and that before, so I can't
1:24:10
analyze how a forest behaves without thinking about what people are doing.
1:24:16
Even that was kind of like, well, I would determine what people would do based
1:24:20
on what I decided people wanted to do.
1:24:25
I still didn't predict what people would do to the ecosystem.
1:24:31
You really have to move into the social sciences and humanities to
1:24:39
figure out what people are thinking and why they want to do things.
1:24:44
That might involve things that aren't on that list.
1:24:49
Surveys, you know, just in social science, surveys-we don't, I guess we survey
1:24:57
foresters and inventory them, but we're not asking their opinion of things.
1:25:02
I guess in that sense it's different.
1:25:05
That's important to figure out.
1:25:09
How do human systems actually behave and get controlled?
1:25:14
If ecologists want to figure out not just have this thing that comes
1:25:20
outside to their box, that just comes as a result, but they want to figure
1:25:27
out actually how it comes or how it varies, they have got to go beyond,
1:25:36
involve disciplines in which they're not ecosystem-oriented at all, which are much
1:25:42
more geared towards what people are doing.
1:25:45
I suppose you have hypotheses and observations and experiments
1:25:51
you could do with people, so maybe it's not something new.
1:25:53
But it's a really different perspective on science.
1:25:58
Then we have to realize that not everything is-there's a lot about
1:26:05
how people feel about things that determines how they react to things.
1:26:14
That could involve the humanities,
1:26:19
particularly if these things are spiritual or artistic, whatever,
1:26:23
this could be a motivator for what they want to have happen that's not
1:26:28
even captured by social science.
1:26:33
I guess what I'm arguing for, if an ecological scientist wants mechanistic
1:26:39
[understanding] and really wanted to know the mechanisms of what's controlling or
1:26:44
what's happening in a forest ecosystem and people are involved, then they
1:26:50
have to go into the science, or someone has to get into the science of people.
1:26:56
Because, otherwise, you're just declaring what people do and that's not mechanistic.
1:27:01
It simply isn't.
1:27:04
I've tried to make this argument to my colleagues.
1:27:06
I think they've been receptive that, you know, if you're going to really
1:27:10
go down the mechanism route for
1:27:14
ecosystems, why won't you go down the mechanism for humans?
1:27:20
Otherwise you're just saying humans are some black box that they just do A,
1:27:24
B, or C, but you have no understanding of why, so how is that mechanistic?
1:27:32
It isn't.
1:27:35
I'm not sure that's exactly what you're looking for, but it's
1:27:40
certainly-to the degree that those disciplines might involve different
1:27:46
levels of evidence or approaches,
1:27:51
you have to accept those methodologies to learn about that part of the system.
1:27:57
It makes me think, too, of what you said earlier, just even within science, there
1:28:01
are these diverse approaches and, if you want to understand an object, you can't
1:28:04
just look at it from one direction and I think that extends as well to the social
1:28:09
sciences and humanities as well, right?
1:28:11
That's right.
1:28:12
That's right.
1:28:14
The irony is I listened to colleagues-we're rigorous, mechanistic,
1:28:18
process-based, humans just do this.
1:28:23
How is that any of what you've just described?
1:28:28
It isn't.
1:28:29
Right.
1:28:33
Thank you for that.
1:28:34
I just have a couple of concluding questions left to wrap our interview up.
1:28:41
What significant ideas have emerged from the Andrews science community and how
1:28:45
did the science of these ideas evolve in terms of questions and methods?
1:28:50
Well, I think we're known for a couple of things.
1:28:54
One is the importance of older, old-growth systems and behaviors
1:29:02
of landscapes and ecosystems.
1:29:06
That really came from
1:29:12
looking-people knew what old growth systems were-biological deserts,
1:29:18
unproductive, had to get rid of them.
1:29:22
Jerry Franklin and others said, "Well, I don't know about that. Let's see what they
1:29:26
actually are." They wrote a very important
1:29:32
General Technical Report that was in the gray literature [Franklin et al,
1:29:34
1981, US Forest Service Gen. Tech.
1:29:35
Rpt.
1:29:36
PNW-118.
1:29:37
https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/lter/pubs/pdf/pub125.pdf], but it was basically lessons of
1:29:37
old-growth systems, essentially.
1:29:39
That's been super important germ for other people thinking about forests and their
1:29:47
management, and it's also had very applied
1:29:52
effects of changing perspectives, even in places like Germany where it
1:29:58
was production forest-driven and now they've got major areas that they're
1:30:04
setting aside to turn into old forests.
1:30:07
Now, I don't think it directly came from Andrews, but a lot of those ideas
1:30:14
at their heart came from the Andrews.
1:30:18
They've had world-wide impacts on forest management, what people study
1:30:23
and think about and debate in the science and in the application.
1:30:28
Another one I got involved in was dead trees, the role that
1:30:32
dead trees play in ecosystems.
1:30:36
That I think has had a huge impact.
1:30:39
We wrote a major review article.
1:30:41
It's been cited, I don't know, three thousand times or more.
1:30:46
It just keeps going up.
1:30:47
At least three thousand times, I think.
1:30:52
It's created a whole field of ecological science.
1:30:56
Some of it is I think silly, because dead trees have been around.
1:30:59
But nonetheless, that really came from the Andrews.
1:31:03
I remember a series of proposals that we wrote and the first was rejected
1:31:08
because dead trees only occurred on the Andrews Experimental Forest.
1:31:13
It was a very interesting study, but they only occur in the Andrews.
1:31:20
That's because it had been published there.
1:31:23
Then the next review where we revised, the next series of reviews, well,
1:31:29
it's all very interesting science, but it doesn't apply anywhere
1:31:33
except for the Pacific Northwest.
1:31:36
It just went through this series of ever-expanding areas where it applied.
1:31:42
As I pointed out, dead trees have existed for 340 million years on planet earth.
1:31:49
They resulted in major coal deposits.
1:31:54
They changed the form of rivers.
1:31:56
You
1:31:59
know I just don't get it.
1:32:01
But I think that was another big area.
1:32:07
I think two more, very quickly, one was trying to, and this was because
1:32:16
of Fred Swanson and Steve Eubanks and others sort of management of
1:32:23
scientific collaboration-how can we create an ecologically based forestry?
1:32:31
I think that has been huge, particularly on the applied front.
1:32:38
Riparian management-that's another big one.
1:32:45
Huge impacts globally.
1:32:48
I think the last one [I said, two], but the third one
1:32:55
I think Fred and others through their work between the humanities and science
1:32:59
that has been a huge contribution.
1:33:03
It hasn't been solely the Andrews, but Fred Swanson has been a leader in that,
1:33:09
and he really pushed that through the network, and I think that has been huge.
1:33:15
You know I go back to this idea of discovery.
1:33:21
Ecological scientists do not have a monopoly on discovery.
1:33:29
Scientists do not have a monopoly on discovery about our world.
1:33:35
Other disciplines can discover things about our world.
1:33:40
They might be subjective, but that's fine.
1:33:42
It's still a discovery.
1:33:48
I think he's pushed that idea that we do not have to have these separate silos.
1:33:55
They certainly should communicate and the more that we can agree that we're all
1:34:01
trying to find out what's going on and we can learn from each other, the more
1:34:07
we'll learn and the faster we'll learn.
1:34:10
That's good.
1:34:13
Then with the arts and humanities and the interface specifically, is that relatively
1:34:17
unique to Andrews Forest compared to the rest of the LTER community?
1:34:21
No.
1:34:24
They didn't all get involved that I know of, but a number of them got
1:34:28
involved in really interesting ways.
1:34:31
There's an LTER that's North Temperate Lakes [U.
1:34:35
Wisconsin-Madison] and they got involved and our primary involvement
1:34:40
was to writing, creative writing.
1:34:45
They did more visual arts and so they had a fantastic- Well,
1:34:53
it was a visual arts project, but it basically showed the replacement
1:34:58
of an iconic fish, the walleye, by an invasive species of fish.
1:35:06
It was really quite well done, but also just summarized what
1:35:11
have we done to these places.
1:35:13
Anyways, each site has had a different take on it, but I'm not sure the degree
1:35:21
to which NSF is still supporting that.
1:35:24
You'd have to talk to Fred, but
1:35:28
even this project here.
1:35:30
The fact that you're putting this into an archive so historians can look at it.
1:35:38
That's another area of trying to, well provide fodder
1:35:43
actually for the humanities.
1:35:48
I think it's been really fruitful, and I think Fred had a huge influence and
1:35:55
still has a huge influence in pushing that forward-history, written word.
1:36:03
Some of it's been really quite received and very profound.
1:36:07
I tried to one, a woman's poem, I can't remember her name, but
1:36:15
I just couldn't help but sob.
1:36:17
I mean, just thinking about it chokes me up.
1:36:24
It was actually based on something she observed or thought about when she was
1:36:30
at one of the log decomposition sites.
1:36:33
I think this was something made of-I can't remember.
1:36:38
Anyways, it was about how we're going to pass and what
1:36:45
the role that death plays, basically, in life.
1:36:49
It was pretty amazing stuff.
1:36:52
Is it in the-there's the book that they put together.
1:36:56
Heartwood, I think, or something like that.
1:36:58
[the book was Forest Under Story] It may be.
1:37:01
Yeah, and then there was the, another guy wrote an essay, [Robert Michael]
1:37:06
Pyle I think his name was, about being in it for the long-term [. The Long Haul.
1:37:12
Orion] . Really influential stuff, very powerful.
1:37:16
It's not all that way, but I got to say some of the science
1:37:19
is not very powerful either.
1:37:19
Some of it is.
1:37:19
Some of it isn't.
1:37:19
For
1:37:27
my concluding question-what do you see are the principles and motivating forces
1:37:32
that drive the Andrews as a community?
1:37:36
Well,
1:37:40
probably there's several.
1:37:42
One is, you know, the fact that there is a community and you can
1:37:48
have these kinds of discussions.
1:37:50
That attracts some people.
1:37:52
Now, as the PI, I would give certain people money in trying to encourage
1:37:57
them to be part of it, and they were really uncomfortable being a
1:38:01
part of a community that diverse.
1:38:04
That did not interest them.
1:38:06
They took the money.
1:38:07
They did good work, but they weren't motivated.
1:38:10
But I think there are people who
1:38:16
this is really attractive to.
1:38:22
That's part of it.
1:38:24
It creates opportunities to recruit a sort of person who want, who feel like
1:38:30
the want to contribute to something greater than their narrow field.
1:38:34
Not everybody's like that and it's fine.
1:38:36
Sometimes they do not want to contribute to the community, but they still
1:38:42
contribute and that's fine, too.
1:38:46
I think the other thing that keeps it going is the fact that it
1:38:49
exists, that there's a tradition.
1:38:51
You start to create traditions of behavior and thinking that
1:38:58
take on a life of their own.
1:39:02
I suppose someone could come along and really do it in, or a group of
1:39:07
people could come in and do it in.
1:39:11
We see that.
1:39:12
I don't want to get political, but it's hard to not observe today's
1:39:18
politics and realize that a certain way of treating each other and working
1:39:25
together is just, it's like evaporated.
1:39:31
Hopefully, we get it back so that everyone isn't necessarily an enemy.
1:39:35
I don't want to sound like a political candidate, but I differ
1:39:39
with you but there are things that we think we have to work on and let's
1:39:43
figure out a way to make it happen.
1:39:51
You know, it's taken a long time to destroy that and hopefully
1:39:55
it's not been destroyed.
1:39:56
I'm not saying it could go on forever without maintenance and some love
1:40:00
and care, but I think it's probably reached a point where someone would
1:40:05
really have to go after it hard and vigorously to snuff it out.
1:40:11
It's too embedded now in too many people's thinking and it's an expectation that
1:40:17
people have of how the system will work.
1:40:23
It's taken a long time, but it started like in the '70s, '60s and '70s, with
1:40:29
this idea of let's sit down and tell each other stories and learn things
1:40:33
and let's also try to put stuff together and it's grown from there.
1:40:37
It just keeps expanding out in terms of what it's including.
1:40:45
I'm sure there's challenges along the way, but that's a natural,
1:40:48
maybe productive part of it.
1:40:50
Well, yeah there's challenges.
1:40:53
You know keeping a long-term, say measurements program together is
1:40:59
really hard because you're always asking for the same thing and it's like
1:41:03
well, don't you ask for anything new?
1:41:05
When will your study be done?
1:41:09
What's fascinating about long-term data is ... everybody wants
1:41:12
it, no one wants to pay for it.
1:41:15
I've seen this over and over again.
1:41:20
But as long as we keep discovering things, I suppose, you know, there
1:41:25
will be a motivation to fund it.
1:41:27
That's a tough thing.
1:41:30
It's been hard to convince NSF to fund the humanities, social sciences, you
1:41:38
know, are siloed, too, because the social sciences doesn't view that this
1:41:46
cutting-edge social science work done at the LTERs, they're not interested.
1:41:50
But what you find, if you study science, is that you can take two
1:41:56
relatively well-known things and put them together and create something new.
1:42:04
NSF's view is each thing has to be new to discover something new.
1:42:08
But that's not how it works.
1:42:10
You can take two knowns and discover new, in my mind, but they've struggled
1:42:17
as an institution to recognize that.
1:42:25
Keeping the diversity, there are scientists that are like, well, why
1:42:31
should we fund anything on the humanities?
1:42:35
It's not rigorous.
1:42:36
It's subjective.
1:42:38
But that doesn't mean it's not important or influential.
1:42:41
Like I said, if you can read a piece of paper and start weeping,
1:42:46
my God, how is that not influential?
1:42:49
Give me a break.
1:42:50
Or relative?
1:42:51
I mean you know I'm an old football player.
1:42:54
I like to smash people's heads.
1:42:55
I'm reading something and weeping?
1:42:58
I mean, maybe my brain's softening.
1:43:03
Maybe I've been banged too many times
1:43:07
in the head, I guess.
1:43:08
Possibly [chuckles]
1:43:09
. More than likely
1:43:13
[smiles]
1:43:14
. Well, is there any final words that you want to contribute to the interview,
1:43:19
to the conversations we've had?
1:43:21
No, no this has been fun.
1:43:23
I'm glad we went through the whole thing.
1:43:26
I enjoy this sort of thing.
1:43:29
It's good to think about things in general terms and get out of your ruts and all
1:43:34
the little paths you're always going on.
1:43:36
I appreciate the opportunity.
1:43:37
Of course.
1:43:38
It's fun.
1:43:39
My pleasure.
1:43:40
I appreciate you taking the time today.
1:43:42
Okay.
1:43:43
Well, enjoy the rest of your evening.
1:43:45
You too.
1:43:45
Bye, now.
1:43:46
Bye.
