00:05
Okay.
00:08
My name is Sara Khatib and this research is for my master's thesis, the research
00:13
involves the history of different traditions of science at the Andrews
00:17
Forest and the philosophical perception of nature that underlies these traditions.
00:21
I would like to ask you a few open-ended questions regarding these topics.
00:26
I expect the duration of the interview to take up to one hour to complete,
00:30
but maybe up to two hours, depending on your interest in knowledge, would you
00:34
like to participate in this interview?
00:37
Yes, please.
00:38
We can end the interview at any point you wish to do so.
00:41
So, just please inform me right away if you no longer want to participate
00:45
and the interview will immediately end.
00:48
Do I have permission to record this interview?
00:50
Yes, you do.
00:51
The interview will be deposited with the Oregon State University Library
00:57
Special Collections and Archives Research Center for preservation and access.
01:01
Their commitment to open access includes the release of contextualized
01:05
interview content online.
01:07
Are you willing for this interview and its derivatives, including a
01:11
transcript and an interview abstract to be made available online?
01:16
Yes, I am.
01:18
Great, then we shall resume the interview.
01:22
So I'm here with Dr. Julia Jones professor and program head for geography.
01:28
She received her PhD.
01:32
in Geography and Environmental Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1983 and
01:37
made her way to the OSU community in 1989.
01:41
Julia studies the dynamic nature of the Pacific Northwest forest and
01:45
how different drivers of change can affect water yield, water quality,
01:48
landscape disturbances, and climate.
01:51
Are you ready to begin?
01:54
Yes.
01:56
So the first few sets of questions are in regards to your personal
02:00
philosophy and practice of science.
02:03
And the first question I would like to ask is, how would you define an ecosystem?
02:12
I define an ecosystem as a set of biotic and abiotic interactions.
02:20
And how would you describe the nature of an ecosystem?
02:24
Are all ecosystems static, dynamic, orderly, or chaotic?
02:31
That's a really interesting question.
02:37
I see ecosystems as dynamic and I see them
02:46
as neither orderly nor chaotic but perhaps somewhere something in between.
02:52
There is some order and some stochasticity, some randomness.
02:56
And then to me, brittle and fragile are more synonyms than antonym.
03:03
So do you want to explain that to me better?
03:07
I suppose resilient versus fragile is the spectrum that I'm looking to ask.
03:15
I see them as resilient.
03:17
Yeah, okay.
03:18
So they are a combination of order and chaos and more or less resilient.
03:25
Yes, and dynamic.
03:27
And dynamic.
03:28
Yes.
03:29
And would you say that that's consistent with all forest
03:38
ecosystems?
03:38
Oh, so that's a good question.
03:40
I was thinking about all kinds of ecosystems - forest, stream,
03:48
marine, coastal, alpine, arctic.
03:53
Yeah, you name it.
03:57
And what is your theoretical philosophical background and how does
04:01
that apply to you toward your science?
04:05
I don't really have much of a philosophical background in college.
04:11
It was popular in the 1970s to read Thomas Kuhn's theory of Scientific Revolutions.
04:21
I do some teaching in my classes about deductive versus inductive reasoning
04:27
which may get to the next question.
04:32
So maybe that's enough to get us going.
04:35
Yeah.
04:39
So how would you describe your scientific style?
04:46
So, I do not conduct experiments myself with physical materials, but I do
04:57
use data from long-term experiments.
05:02
And I also would say that I use models as experiments.
05:13
So,
05:16
I looked up what you might have meant by Baconian versus Popperian.
05:23
Do you want to describe that a little bit to me so that I can answer your question?
05:28
So Baconian in the sense of, it's more inductive and open-ended, but
05:33
there's still some experimental manipulation of matter.
05:39
And Popper is hypothetical deductive so you have a hypothesis prior
05:45
to doing your experiment and
05:53
it's, it's more forward predicting rather than backward predicting,
05:58
I think, is another way to put it.
06:01
Well, that's interesting.
06:03
So, most, most of the work that I do is an analysis of long-term data.
06:10
So it's looking in the past.
06:13
So the models that I fit are our models about the past behavior of ecosystems.
06:20
They are not projections or predictions of the future.
06:23
But having said that, the way I approach structuring those models is probably a
06:33
combination of induction and deduction, in the sense that there are theories or
06:41
concepts like the hydrological cycle, for example, or the water balance or the
06:48
energy budget that lead you to expect certain kinds of relationships that can
06:55
be tested by fitting statistical models to data, and then they can be falsified.
07:03
So there definitely is some falsification involved, but it's a retrospective
07:13
analysis of past data and there is also some induction because the
07:21
process really works by fitting models and then trying alternative
07:27
models and so that could perhaps be regarded as an inductive process of
07:35
attempting different kinds of analyses to explore alternative ideas, maybe.
07:45
And I want to go back for a moment.
07:48
Do you mind elaborating when you say models as experiments?
07:51
Is that what you're referring to, right now?
07:53
So,
07:56
the notion of using a model as an experiment is that you don't...So
08:03
there are many different kinds of models: optimization, simulation,
08:07
empirical, theoretical, etc. statistical, mathematical.
08:14
The kinds of models that I typically fit are empirical statistical models, but
08:22
they do attempt to get at mechanisms.
08:25
So they attempt to be mechanistic models as well.
08:30
And I like to use models as an experiment because I don't expect the model
08:37
necessarily to fit well or to explain the data well, in a statistical sense,
08:43
and I'm as interested in the ways in which the model does not explain
08:51
the data as I am in the way it does.
08:55
And I'm interested in starting with very simple models.
09:02
And then incrementally adding complexity to the models to try to see how the
09:10
model behavior changes as you add, for example, different variables.
09:16
So
09:18
I regard that as an experiment in the sense that each time you change
09:23
the model, you add a variable or you change some parameters in
09:30
the model, or you change the structure of the equation or equations
09:34
that you're using in the model.
09:36
Each of those actions can be thought of as an experiment.
09:39
And then the outcome is how the performance of the model changes.
09:45
And that process is an iterative one, but the learning happens from the successive
09:51
iterations and modifications of the model.
09:56
Great, and that's interesting because this reminds me of the concept of
10:03
reification where people are wary of models where we superimpose them and
10:08
assume them to be reality themselves when they're supposed to be analytic tools.
10:13
Is that your way of sort of preventing from that happening?
10:19
Right, yeah.
10:20
The model isn't an answer in itself, and it's never finished and it's
10:26
never correct, it just helps you to see something both because of what it
10:35
explains, and what it doesn't explain.
10:38
That's an interesting take on models that I have yet to come across.
10:43
Would you say that there are people that use it in a different way,
10:46
where they do see it as answers?
10:48
Is that something you've seen within your field?
10:52
So my field.
10:54
It's hard to know really what my field would be, but I could say that
10:58
certainly in the field of hydrology,
11:02
many of the practitioners of hydrology, though not all of them, are civil
11:07
engineers and many of those people utilize hydrologic simulation models and there is
11:13
a very large literature on many aspects of model performance and modeling philosophy.
11:24
And,
11:26
so, within that community, you find, of course, people whose careers are
11:34
built around the use of a particular model which they continue to develop
11:38
and refine over time, whether it's about snow or streamflow or whatever.
11:45
But you also find people within the field of hydrology can often, these are people
11:51
who do not have an engineering background, but it's not necessarily the case, who
11:56
are agnostic in their use of models.
11:59
They don't favor any particular model and they regard models as tools
12:06
for exploration, which are more in the way that I had just described.
12:17
And then one more thing I want to return to and elaborate on, is you
12:22
said that you use models, not so much as predictive tools, but more
12:25
so to analyze past mechanisms.
12:28
Can you give an example or describe that a little bit more?
12:32
Yeah.
12:33
A simple example would be there is a long-term paired watershed experiment
12:40
at the Andrews Forest in which, for the case of simplicity, there are
12:47
two watersheds, both of them had 150- to 500-year-old forest on them
12:55
at the beginning of the experiment.
12:57
In the early 1950s stream gauges were installed in those watersheds
13:04
and streamflow was monitored.
13:06
And then in 1962, after about 10 years, one of the watersheds was clear cut
13:12
over a four year period and then burned.
13:17
So hydrologic theory, or more simply, the water balance would lead you to
13:23
expect that, because we believe that runoff or streamflow is the difference
13:30
between incoming precipitation and water that is lost from the
13:34
watershed by evapotranspiration,
13:37
you would expect that the removal of the forest would reduce
13:43
evapotranspiration, and therefore increase
13:48
streamflow.
13:48
But, you would also expect that as the forest regrew or, actually,
13:53
as a planted forest grew in that spot, evapotranspiration would
13:58
resume and increase, and then streamflow would go back down again.
14:04
So, I have conducted analyses using past data from those watersheds to test by
14:12
how much did streamflow increase after the clear-cutting of the old-growth
14:18
forest and burning and by how much and what rate has it been declining as
14:23
the planted forest has been growing.
14:26
Is that what you were looking for?
14:28
Yes, that's great.
14:30
Thank you.
14:32
And how have your disciplinary roots influenced the development
14:37
of your approach to science?
14:41
Well, my disciplinary background is rather peripatetic.
14:46
I have a bachelor's degree in economic development.
14:51
And a master's degree in international relations and a Ph.D. in geography
14:57
and environmental engineering.
15:00
So the trajectory of my disciplinary development was that I moved from
15:08
the social sciences more into the natural sciences via engineering.
15:16
So before my Ph.D., I did a lot of work with mathematical optimization modeling,
15:22
which is a different kind of modeling than anything we've talked about here.
15:26
So,
15:34
I guess
15:37
I would say that my education my educational trajectory were motivated
15:45
by an interest in social issues.
15:47
And I think we'll get to that later in the interview, but that that was a reason
15:54
for studying economic development and international relations, and then that
15:59
led me to look for specific questions in the natural world that are relevant to
16:06
international policy or domestic policy related to things such as wood fuels
16:12
energy, which was the topic of my Ph.D. and the effects of deforestation on soil
16:19
characteristics which were also part of my Ph.D., and the causes of deforestation.
16:27
And so the engineering methods, which I learned and developed for my Ph.D.,
16:41
have not been part of what I have continued to do, but rather, I shifted
16:46
into this other kind of statistical empirical modeling that I just described
16:55
to you because I became interested in explaining what had happened in the past
17:04
as opposed to using models that give you answers to other kinds of questions.
17:12
So a mathematical optimization modeling is most generally used to
17:17
try to provide an answer to a problem and that is what should people do.
17:22
How should such-and-such a resource be managed?
17:26
But I became more interested in well, what has actually been
17:30
happening in these ecosystems,
17:33
which I thought are important questions to understand before we make
17:40
decisions about how we ought to manage?
17:45
Would you say that that approach contributes or is aligned with
17:49
natural history in any way?
17:51
Certainly, yeah
17:55
And at what point did you start turning towards hydrology and
18:00
studying forest-stream interactions?
18:07
So,
18:09
I got a master's degree in international relations.
18:13
I got a bachelor's degree in economic development in 1977
18:17
and then a master's degree in international relations in 1979 or 80.
18:24
And I was very interested in issues related to wood fuel energy and
18:31
how people were faring in poor developing countries in Africa.
18:37
So the Ph.D. was an exploration both of mathematical modeling for that question.
18:45
But also, I had an opportunity to do field research in Tanzania and
18:51
I think that was something of a transformative experience for me.
18:56
To work in the field and try to communicate in Swahili with
19:03
Tanzanian colleagues and workers and to sample soils and forests and I became
19:12
more ... I think I was humbled by the complexity and diversity of the ecosystems
19:20
and became much more interested in trying to explore and understand those.
19:26
And so, why don't you lead me back to the question that you would like me to answer?
19:35
Just at what point you shifted towards studying hydrology?
19:39
So that led to empirical work on describing and characterizing soils,
19:48
but which I conducted while I was on the faculty of the University of
19:53
California, Santa Barbara working in Africa with my then-husband, both in
19:59
Tanzania and Kenya, and in Eritrea.
20:02
But then when I moved to Oregon State University in
20:08
1989 I had the opportunity to begin to work with long-term records
20:14
of streamflow associated with the Andrews Forest, and that has been
20:22
an endeavor of 30 years, I guess.
20:26
And then would you say that the combination of these different academic
20:32
trajectories, from the social science to environmental engineering to streamflow,
20:36
has that all culminated into influencing your philosophy of science today, or
20:41
do you think that it's very different than it once was if that makes sense?
20:51
For
20:57
me, as a practitioner of science, I would guess that my philosophy is sort
21:04
of continually evolving as I learn more about the ecosystems because each question
21:14
that you attempt to answer leads you to what you don't know, which means that you
21:22
start a new question and you may expand from one place to another, like looking
21:28
at different sites and comparing them.
21:31
I've done some of that or you might look to change the scale at which
21:36
you're looking at something the temporal scale or the spatial scale.
21:48
So, I'm not aware of having a philosophy of science, but rather, I feel like
21:56
I'm on an adventure of a treasure hunt of continuing to find new things that
22:03
puzzle me or questions that I think need to be answered open questions and
22:14
trying to answer them with existing data.
22:17
So that's the fundamental recurring theme is that in the fields in which
22:24
I work there is a dearth of use of analysis of existing data sets.
22:33
People have a tendency, for reasons that I don't really understand, to utilize
22:37
models which don't rely on real data very much or to engage in experiments
22:47
that produce data from a manipulated system that's been manipulated by a
22:52
researcher and by contrast to those two approaches, which I think is anticipating
22:59
a later question in your interview, but I am principally interested in
23:03
what we can learn by observing natural systems, including those that have been
23:08
manipulated by humans, possibly as part of a big experiment, but not trying
23:16
to simulate them or optimize them.
23:25
And what is your strategy in developing a research question?
23:30
Well, each research question seems to emerge from the
23:33
work that's been done before.
23:36
But also the research questions tend to emerge somewhat opportunistically
23:42
from events and sometimes they emerge from collaborations, the interests
23:49
of a colleague in a conversation that sparks an interaction, or a student who
23:58
has an interest in a particular topic.
24:02
But the thread, but for the thread of work, which is probably most
24:07
closely related to me, you know, papers that I have led the ideas
24:13
to seem to emerge as a sequence.
24:16
One paper, leading to a question that hasn't been answered, which
24:22
then leads to the next analysis.
24:27
So that doesn't really sound like a strategy, very much.
24:31
But that's the practice.
24:34
That's how it unfolds.
24:39
What are your thoughts in regards to objectivity in scientific research?
24:50
I guess I would say that
24:57
it's very difficult or perhaps impossible to identify a research question
25:03
objectively because the research question is always something that is based on
25:10
your prior experience and knowledge and your inclinations and which include your
25:17
feelings, such as places that you love.
25:20
Or you want to learn more about or something that you fear, maybe perhaps
25:28
not so much for me, but possibly.
25:31
So I guess I would say that research question identification,
25:35
I see as being highly subjective.
25:39
But then the conduct of the research itself needs to seek objectivity, at
25:45
least in the sense of rigor or respecting certain rules about the use of data, the
25:52
fitting of models, the presentation of a balanced evaluation of what you found.
26:01
Not trying to influence the results.
26:03
And
26:07
as a researcher, how do you use the scientific method to find truth?
26:15
Well, I guess I would say that I'm probably a post-modernist in the sense
26:19
that I am not a believer that there is a truth with a capital T. But I do think
26:27
that the scientific method is viable and best that we have an approach to
26:39
learning about our world and learning about the things about the world
26:46
that we need to know in order to make decisions to try to take care of the
26:51
world and ourselves at the same time.
27:04
Are there laws of nature?
27:05
And if so can you explain what a law of nature
27:12
means?
27:12
Certainly there are physical laws.
27:14
You know the laws of thermodynamics are certainly laws of nature.
27:20
And so is the theory of relativity, which operates a different time
27:26
scale than we mostly live in and the Newtonian laws of mechanics seem to
27:33
me to be quite applicable and relevant to the world that we live in, as
27:39
people are time and space scales.
27:45
I have not encountered anything in ecology that I would
27:48
consider being a law, however.
27:52
I think that that's a really interesting feature of the state of
27:57
knowledge in whatever you want to call it, environmental science or
28:02
ecology in general, that it has not been possible to identify things
28:09
that could be considered laws.
28:12
And, it appears to be the case that the complexity of ecosystems so far
28:21
defies our capacity to perceive laws.
28:31
And you just touched on this a bit, but I want to talk
28:33
about it a little bit further.
28:34
So what exactly is it about ecology, the complexity?
28:39
Can you elaborate what you mean that it defies our ability
28:41
to establish or find laws?
28:44
If you can, describe what about the complexity?
28:48
Well, perhaps a way to do it would be to talk about models.
28:52
I had the great privilege for about a decade to work closely with some
29:00
very talented senior mathematicians in Oregon State University and some
29:05
very talented computer scientists and we were working in a field that
29:12
we called ecosystem informatics, but the idea was to bring together
29:20
the methods and approaches and understanding of mathematics and
29:25
the computational tools of computer science to examine and try to
29:30
understand ecosystem dynamics.
29:37
There were many really deep thoughtful conversations that occurred among
29:43
the group of us as we were pondering this area of intersection among
29:48
these different disciplines.
29:51
But one of the ones that stuck with me is that mathematical models of systems
29:59
tend to fall into two different classes.
30:03
One of them is a sort of equilibrium model that solves for a particular condition
30:11
that is presumed to be like a steady-state condition that doesn't change over time.
30:21
And other forms of mathematical models are ones in which their time is
30:30
varying and processes vary over time.
30:34
But typically the equilibrium-based models are applied on two processes
30:42
that operate at longer timescales, while the time-varying models are
30:48
applied to things that operate in relatively short time scales.
30:52
So this gets back to one of your first questions, and that
30:56
is that ecosystems are dynamic.
30:59
In fact, the earth as a system is dynamic on very long time scales.
31:06
And so the mathematician commented that mathematics appears to lack models which
31:14
can capture that sort of large scale or long time dynamics and this may be
31:28
well, it seems to be related to a number of your questions.
31:32
So maybe you can just ask me more if you're interested.
31:36
Yeah, that was a great example.
31:41
So I'm curious as to why it is the long-term scales are more difficult
31:45
to model, I would have assumed, that the short scales are more difficult
31:50
because there is more flux to them.
31:54
So I'm curious as to why longer terms are more difficult or challenging?
31:59
Well, this relates to the fact that we don't have a theory for ecosystems
32:06
yet, right, because what we understand about ecosystems is that they are
32:13
continually responding to factors that are operating across a wide
32:17
range of temporal and spatial scales.
32:20
Everything from plate tectonics, you know, and changing the shape of
32:25
continents and changing how and the climate system and the coupling of the
32:32
ocean and atmospheres and the currents of air that bring moisture to certain
32:37
places and not to others and then back to tectonics that build the mountains
32:43
that obstruct the currents of air and heat and moisture, which then influences
32:49
which things might grow where but that's all a deterministic perspective.
32:56
And then, on the other hand, we have a life system that is continually
33:03
evolving and adapting and changing to conditions on multiple timescales.
33:09
Sometimes the adaptation of the response may take just a few hours
33:16
and in other cases, it may take decades or centuries, so that is what
33:25
those processes provided dynamism to the Earth system, which means that
33:31
equilibrium models don't work very well.
33:35
But on the other hand, the short-term dynamic models also
33:40
don't work very well because they don't capture those longer-term
33:46
processes and their influences.
33:50
So, is it true that in the history of ecology as a discipline that at
33:55
one point it was very fixated on equilibrium models, and then that
34:03
got replaced by the recognition of dynamic nature ecosystems
34:07
with ecosystem ecology now?
34:11
Well, it's a good question.
34:12
I don't consider myself to be an authoritative historian of ecology,
34:18
but, certainly, I think that
34:24
people have ... . Maybe the way to describe it is that ecologists have
34:31
interacted with mathematicians throughout the history of ecology, which was sort
34:36
of born around 1970 and so ecologists did adopt mathematical models to try
34:43
to represent ecosystems or ecological processes and they may have early on,
34:50
adopted equilibrium type models, but pretty clear pretty soon it became
34:57
evident that those were not adequate for describing what's actually observed and
35:05
that kind of gets us to the motivation for and the timing of the creation of
35:11
the Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the National Science Foundation.
35:15
So perhaps this is somewhat relevant to your question
35:18
about the history of ecology.
35:20
If you think of ecology as a discipline that came into being really around the
35:27
late 1960s and early 1970s coincident with many of our strongest environmental
35:32
protection laws in the United States.
35:35
By the time even by the mid-1970s, it was evident to researchers that ecosystems
35:47
change over time at multiple times scales and a long-term perspective was needed.
35:52
So there was a pretty quick realization.
35:54
I think that ecosystems are anything but static.
36:01
And my last question for this section is what are your overall motivations?
36:06
Is it for curiosity or finding real-world solutions?
36:14
Well, I guess both.
36:21
As a person, I find that life is so much more rewarding when
36:26
you look at the world and try to understand why it is the way it is.
36:31
So that maybe curiosity and the end the process of sort of dialectical
36:36
process of making observations and then wondering how to explain them and then
36:42
going back and looking more carefully.
36:45
And wondering, some more.
36:47
I find it to be just enormously satisfying, not because it leads
36:52
to anything particularly, but just because it's a very enjoyable way
36:58
to live in the world and it makes me feel more alive and more appreciative.
37:02
I
37:05
should have mentioned earlier that I started college as an art major and so
37:12
art is about observation and looking.
37:17
Art to me, painting, for example, is about trying to represent what you see,
37:24
rather than what you believe is there.
37:26
And so I think there's a parallel with science as I practice it, which
37:31
is it's an exercise in trying to understand what you see, rather than
37:38
imposing what you believe is there.
37:45
So curiosity, I guess, if that's what you mean by curiosity, is a big
37:50
motivator and a big reward, but I also believe very strongly that people who
37:57
are privileged to have the kinds of job that I have a duty or responsibility
38:05
to try to contribute to the welfare of
38:12
our earth system, including the people who live in it and so applied research
38:20
that focuses on ecological processes [and] hydrological processes, seems to
38:26
me to be potentially a contribution to
38:32
helping us to better understand how the world works so that people in general, not
38:38
me necessarily, could make wiser decisions about the world and how we live in it.
38:46
And if we could just go back for a minute because I'm, really intrigued by this.
38:51
So with your background as an art major, was that in undergraduate school?
38:56
Well, I started taking art lessons as a child and
39:01
I always did really well in art and I loved it.
39:03
It was my favorite probably my favorite subject through high school.
39:09
And when I entered college.
39:11
I thought I would be an art major but I soon realized that I would
39:16
have difficulty supporting myself.
39:18
So I decided that I had to be practical in the most practical major
39:24
that I could think of was economics.
39:27
And
39:33
so because I know with the Reflections program at the Andrews forest,
39:37
there's this new space, since the early 2000s, where artists, as well
39:42
as musicians and philosophers, have come and engaged with the space.
39:48
Can you elaborate a little bit more about the relationship between art and
39:52
science in our understanding of the world or in how we observe the world?
40:05
Yeah, I think that there are many different forms of positive interactions.
40:11
I think the practice of science can be done as an art, some aspects of it.
40:21
For example, clear writing is an art.
40:25
And the creation of intelligible tables and comprehensible graphics and maps can
40:37
have elements of artistic principles in them.
40:43
They're not fine art, but still.
40:46
So I think that science is more effective when it is done with
40:51
attention to some of the principles that also govern artistic endeavors.
41:00
But I also think that an artistic perspective, as I mentioned before,
41:09
which is one of careful observation and depiction of the world around us that
41:17
that's very similar to the process that I feel that I pursue in my own science.
41:27
So I think that the partnership can be a really strong one.
41:35
Alright, so that concludes the first section.
41:37
We will go into this next section a little bit more swiftly through these questions
41:44
and they generally go a little bit faster.
41:45
But the next questions are more so on a community level.
41:50
How these different approaches play a role on a community
41:54
level at the Andrews forest.
41:56
So my first question is what role does natural history play
42:00
in both the historical and current state of the community?
42:06
Well, in my view, natural history is absolutely fundamental to the
42:11
work at the Andrews Experimental Forest, and it is also fundamental
42:17
to the underpinnings of long-term ecological research as an endeavor.
42:24
So,
42:27
do you want me to say more about that?
42:30
Maybe if you can describe how it's contributed if you have any specific
42:37
examples to some of the research that's come out of the Andrews Forest?
42:44
Well, one of the fundamental principles that has emerged not just from the
42:49
Andrews Forest, but all kinds of long-term ecological research, including those sites
42:54
that have National Science Foundation funding and sites that just do long-term
43:00
ecological research, is the importance of history, including the concepts
43:07
of biological legacies, for example, or physical legacies, such as past
43:14
disturbances and how they shape the way to ecosystem response and changes over time.
43:23
So I think
43:28
an awareness of those past events is typically inferred or
43:37
intuited or not usually intuited but inferred from careful observation and
43:45
natural history reconstruction methods.
43:49
But also that knowledge or that perspective, I think is integral to
44:00
any science conducted at a long term ecological research site being able
44:07
to be aware that the process that you're observing today and in this
44:14
location is in some census tied to a distant past, in that place and to
44:22
a much larger area and to that much larger area in the distant past.
44:28
And so that is a key element of what I would consider being
44:37
the most helpful research perspective at the Andrews Forest and also it's a
44:42
big part of the teaching of students who come to the Andrews Forest in classes
44:51
or REU program [Research Experience for Undergraduates program that is
44:53
NSF or university funded] or whatever.
44:55
Do you think that the importance of natural history is still
44:59
recognized, or is it waning at all?
45:07
Oh, that's a good question.
45:09
We do live in an era in which we are somewhat preoccupied probably
45:15
excessively preoccupied and possibly even distracted by our electronic world.
45:25
And so I work a lot with students who spend a lot of time looking at the
45:32
world through a computer where they're observing, you know, layers - geographic
45:39
information system layers of information.
45:44
Or remotely sense data.
45:47
And the students haven't been out to look at the ecosystem.
45:51
So the classes that I teach and one, in particular, is designed to get
45:57
students to go out into the ecosystem and to try to look at it themselves
46:03
directly and remove that interface.
46:06
And I think that electronic media, on the one hand, our computational
46:12
power is of great use to us certainly, it's tremendously helpful to me
46:18
in my own work, but then, the real information comes from the ecosystem.
46:26
It doesn't come from the computer.
46:29
So that's a long-winded way of saying that, you know, students or people
46:35
possibly of your age are those in their 20s and 30s today, who have grown up in an
46:40
era in which Pokemon creatures are better known than the species of real animals
46:49
living in your yard has meant that we have sort of lost touch with our connection
46:59
to how ecosystems really operate.
47:04
That persists into graduate school where people have a belief which
47:11
may be the fault of our educational institutions that proficiency in computer
47:19
technology is the same as learning and that's it's only a part of it,
47:24
and especially for ecosystems studies.
47:29
It's quite inadequate.
47:32
So,
47:35
people, therefore, you know, for a few decades now, I think the students who
47:41
have taken my classes wouldn't have been able to tell me what natural history
47:47
was - they didn't know what the term was.
47:50
But then when they practice it, they discover or they recognize probably
47:55
what they knew all along that it's tremendously powerful and then they tell
47:59
me, "Oh, I'm looking at the world in a completely different way than I used
48:04
to before." I don't know whether they know that that might be called natural
48:08
history or not, but they're doing it.
48:11
So, yes, in answer to your question, I think that our educational systems,
48:19
primarily because of the role of electronic media and the emphasis on
48:26
data that is collected and stored on computers have tended to diminish the
48:34
individual sense of their own power to comprehend the world around them
48:41
through using their own observational skills and that that is something
48:45
I try to emphasize in my teaching.
48:50
And what are some of the things that make them realize that
48:54
they're doing natural history.
48:55
What is it that they're doing?
48:56
Is it about being outside and observing?
49:04
One of the tools is the notion of multiple working hypotheses.
49:09
So, you know, you take a whodoneit approach to looking at the world.
49:14
You don't just look at it and say, oh, that's pretty, you say,
49:19
why is it the way it is here.
49:22
And how many different explanations can I think of why
49:28
this might look the way it does?
49:31
So I think that's a principal approach.
49:36
And what about hypothesis-driven and experimental research.
49:42
How has it contributed to the Andrews Forest, both in the past and current
49:48
work?
49:50
Well, I mentioned earlier that a lot of my work has been based on long-term data
49:55
sets from paired watershed experiments.
49:57
So I certainly think that the paired watershed experimental approach has been
50:03
a tremendous contribution to the Andrews Experimental Forest not merely because
50:10
of the experimental treatments that were imposed, but because of the way in
50:17
which the continued efforts to measure the ongoing changes and responses in
50:24
most places have led to some unexpected findings or new questions as time has
50:32
passed, and also those locations have become a point of connection among
50:41
scientists from different disciplines.
50:44
Also, you can cite a fine-scale study within the context of a larger,
50:51
longer-term experiment, there's a lot of richness in terms of the interpretation
50:57
you can make from your humble data set.
51:03
So, from a social perspective, the long term watershed experiments
51:11
have been extremely valuable and they have also generated many new
51:15
science questions that were entirely unanticipated by the founders.
51:21
Another iconic long-term experiment at the Andrews Forest is the
51:29
200-year log decomposition experiment, which also has led to many spin-off
51:34
projects that were not anticipated by its founder [OSU professor Mark
51:39
Harmon] and also, because of where it is located, it has become somewhat
51:45
of an iconic site for the writers in residence program at the Anders Forest.
51:52
And so it has led to the creation of some wonderful poems and essays
51:58
that couldn't possibly have been anticipated by the founders.
52:05
So, I guess I would say an answer to your question is that
52:15
the experimental treatments themselves and the hypotheses that led them have led to
52:21
some interesting work over the long term.
52:25
But mostly it's the fact that the treatments were undertaken and
52:30
have been continued, which has led to the possibility of unexpected
52:36
unplanned and unhypothesized outcomes scientifically and socially in our group.
52:50
And what about ecosystem modeling and modeling in general, let's say,
52:55
what, what are some of the fundamental contributions to the Andrews as a whole?
53:08
I don't have a whole lot of exposure to ecosystem modeling.
53:15
There has been quite a bit of hydrological modeling done with long term records
53:20
from the Andrews Forest, but I commented earlier that the world in hydrologic
53:26
models consists of people either who are advocating for trying to develop a
53:32
particular model and a few others who have maybe a more of a falsification
53:41
perspective toward models that they're all wrong that maybe some are useful
53:46
and you can learn some things from them.
53:48
In terms of ecosystem models.
53:50
The ones I know about are biogeochemical models that to try to predict things like
53:58
the export of nitrogen from a watershed.
54:03
And I think that there is a historical evolution of those types of models, which
54:13
is a little bit similar to my description about the long term experiments in
54:18
the sense that I believe that the most successful efforts initially those efforts
54:26
may have been led by a single individual trying to build a huge, complicated
54:31
model of everything, but that in recent years, those efforts have become
54:37
much more collaborative efforts of people trying to exchange and combine
54:45
their varied perspectives of the different components of an ecosystem
54:51
that they understand and trying to combine it into a larger picture.
54:57
And that's really interesting because we typically get told in the reviews
55:04
of our LTER proposals that we should try to do synthetic modeling and I
55:13
wonder whether the people who asked that really have an idea of what
55:21
would be produced, right, because
55:31
models of everything tend to be models that have so many parameters
55:37
and so many equations in them that they become somewhat meaningless
55:44
and so we have not had a lot of effort invested in that direction
55:51
in our community in the recent past.
55:54
And I think it's because there's more of a sense of respect or even humility
56:01
that efforts to create a model of everything or synthetic models might be
56:07
a doomed exercise for the Andrews Forest.
56:15
I wonder where the desire or fixation on going in that direction comes from.
56:22
I think it would be
56:26
in the peer-review process.
56:28
You know, we get these questions from people who are anonymous reviewers.
56:32
But if we had the opportunity, I think I'm increasingly thinking that
56:38
it would be important to turn that question back and say, well, why do
56:42
you think this would be valuable.
56:44
What would you imagine could be gained by such an exercise, rather than saying,
56:51
"Oh, yes, yes. Well, of course, we will do that because it should be done."
56:55
Is
56:57
that space provided at all.
56:59
Are you able to have that dialectic conversation
57:05
with the reviewers?
57:05
We have every six years.
57:06
Around the middle of each six-year grant [cycle] - in year three -we
57:09
are visited by a team of reviewers.
57:13
And under those circumstances, we can have a conversation.
57:17
So that might happen sometime in the coming years.
57:20
I'd be curious to see [their responses]
57:24
. Well, you're giving me the courage to take it on.
57:27
Because it doesn't.
57:29
Sometimes what seems to be best may come from a societal
57:34
expectation and not so much what actually would be best, you, know.
57:41
Alright, so that leads us to our concluding questions here.
57:45
We're making good time.
57:47
What significant ideas have emerged from the Andrews science community
57:52
and how did the science these ideas of all in terms of questions and methods?
57:56
So we spoke of a few, but if you have any more.
57:59
That's come up in your thoughts.
58:13
We spent we've spent some time fruitlessly, well maybe not fruitlessly,
58:18
but for some years, we thought we ought to write a book about the Andrews Forest.
58:25
And we had a lot of discussions and we have many drafts Fred has many
58:30
drafts of versions of the book.
58:34
But in the conversations that we had about them,
58:40
I associate
58:43
this conceptualization with Fred, but it seems to me to be really useful
58:48
on Fred Swanson, and that is that
58:53
the science at the Andrews Forest has been evolving and continues
58:58
to evolve as a result of three different kinds of sets of changes.
59:05
And those are changes in technology, which provide new forms new sources of data.
59:17
Changes in the environment itself, which may be due to disturbances, like
59:23
the fire or past floods, or gradual changes in like climate change.
59:29
And then changes in society and how we perceive and value ecosystems.
59:36
So,
59:40
the significant ideas that have emerged from the Andrew science community have
59:45
been a reflection of that evolving process in the 1970s at a timeline.
59:52
Logging of old-growth forest was going full bore.
59:57
The Andrews Forest researchers began to understand and write about
1:00:03
the value of retaining deadwood in [forest] ecosystems and in streams.
1:00:10
And at a time when logging was not sparing the riparian zone and trees were
1:00:20
being cut all the way down to the stream network, on the role of the riparian
1:00:24
zone and definition of that concept.
1:00:28
That was a very important finding at a time when landscape-wide logging of all
1:00:35
growth cumulative growth was potentially affecting species pioneering work on the
1:00:43
spotted owl began to reveal its dependence on these larger-scale processes.
1:00:51
In more my own area,
1:00:56
in the early years of the watershed experiments, a principal focus
1:01:02
was on water yield and water quality for downstream users, how
1:01:08
much water and how much sediment.
1:01:12
And then there was a period of time in the 1970s and into the mid-90s when there
1:01:18
were episodes of very big flood strain on snow floods and so societal concerns turn
1:01:25
to the effects of logging on flooding.
1:01:30
But in the last 20 years we have been in a period of climate change when
1:01:36
summer temperature has been increasing and summer rainfall has been declining
1:01:41
and the plantations, or the planted forest that was created as the result of
1:01:46
old-growth logging from the 50s into the 70s in the Andrews Forest or until 1990
1:01:54
in the forest in general, those forests have been growing and using more water
1:01:58
and so attention has shifted to drought or hydrological drought, which is lack
1:02:04
of water during the hot, dry season and
1:02:12
also the long term studies of how ecosystems retain carbon have been a very
1:02:20
important component of the Andrews Forest because they store so much carbon and
1:02:28
the way in which that carbon is retained rather than exported from the system
1:02:35
remains, in some senses, an open question.
1:02:40
So there are so many questions.
1:02:43
Climate change is emerging and spatial variability is an important area.
1:02:53
I'm sure my list is quite incomplete.
1:03:01
And with all those in mind.
1:03:04
What would you say are the unique principles and motivating forces that
1:03:08
drive the Andrews as a community?
1:03:17
I think people are drawn to the
1:03:23
Andrews Experimental Forest and LTER community because it is fundamentally
1:03:30
so much more satisfying to do your personal science in the context of
1:03:36
a community that can react to and be interested in your work and gives you
1:03:43
ideas about how to push it forward.
1:03:47
So the benefits to the participants in the community are the community itself.
1:03:54
And, also, I think the community shares
1:04:01
perhaps reverence is to maybe not too strong a word, a reverence for the
1:04:07
ecosystems themselves and a sense of an abiding curiosity about how they
1:04:14
function and a sense of humility about what we don't understand about them
1:04:21
and a dedication to the notion that more can be learned, by continued
1:04:30
observation of those systems.
1:04:35
So I think that the principles of open sharing and collaboration, which
1:04:42
can be quite challenging at times.
1:04:46
Are a very important element of the community and that it is healthy, as
1:04:55
long as that principle is respected, but if it were to be not respected
1:05:02
and people were excluded or then the community would pretty quickly unravel.
1:05:11
So I think I also think that genuine interest in one another's work and
1:05:18
the desire to learn what each other is learning is a key piece that knits
1:05:26
together the community because people feel that their ideas are of value and that
1:05:36
their ideas can contribute to benefiting the work of other individuals, but also
1:05:43
much more broadly, the way in which the US government stewards the National Forest
1:05:51
System and the streams and the water resources and the wildlife resources
1:05:55
that are present in those ecosystems.
1:06:01
Well, thank you so much.
1:06:03
Are there any final words, you'd like to add?
1:06:08
No, thank you very much for doing this.
1:06:11
I'm very curious to imagine what diversity of perspectives, you may
1:06:17
be getting from different people who work with the Andrews Forest.
1:06:21
I'm sure that there are as many different perspectives or possibly
1:06:26
more different perspectives than individuals whom you have interviewed.
1:06:31
Yeah.
1:06:33
So I think it'll be very rewarding to see the final outcome of your work.
1:06:38
I'm very grateful to you for taking the time and energy
1:06:41
to do such a thoughtful job.
1:06:44
Thank you.
1:06:44
I appreciate it.
1:06:46
It's been very fun so far.
1:06:49
Well, that's great.
1:06:50
Yeah.
