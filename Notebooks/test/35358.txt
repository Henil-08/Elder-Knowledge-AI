00:05
My name is Sara Khatib and this research is for my master's thesis,
00:09
the research involves the history of different traditions of science at the
00:13
Andrews Forest and the philosophical perceptions of nature that underlie
00:17
these different traditions, I would like to ask you a few open ended
00:21
questions regarding these topics.
00:23
I expect the duration of the interview to take up to two hours depending
00:28
on your interest and knowledge.
00:30
Would you like to participate in this interview?
00:34
Yes.
00:36
We can end the interview at any point you wish to do so.
00:40
Please inform me right away if you no longer want to participate and
00:43
the interview will immediately end.
00:45
Do I have permission to record this interview?
00:48
Yes, you do.
00:49
Perfect.
00:50
All right.
00:55
Okay, so now I'm going to begin with a brief little intro
01:01
Yeah.
01:05
So before we begin, I want to offer a brief summary as to why we are here
01:09
today, as you know, there is currently a collection of oral histories in the Oregon
01:13
State University's Special Collection and Archives Research Center titled "Voices
01:18
of the Forest Voices of the Mills" and that collection consists of stories on
01:22
people's personal backgrounds and how their journey has led them to the Andrews.
01:28
It also consists of stories that illustrate certain political and
01:31
cultural transitions, such as the transition away from the timber era to
01:35
the conservation era and the planning for the Pacific Northwest forest plan.
01:40
Finally, it discusses the overall culture of LTER.
01:44
Today we are going to build from that by asking more direct
01:47
questions about your personal philosophy and practice of science.
01:51
And then scale up to the philosophy and practice of
01:54
science on the community level.
01:56
This interview will inform the writing of my master's thesis.
02:00
My research questions ask: What are the traditions of science that characterize
02:05
the Andrew's community and what are the philosophies of nature that
02:09
underlie these different traditions?
02:12
I'm here with Dr. Fred Swanson who completed his PhD in geology
02:17
at the University of Oregon and began his work at the Andrews
02:22
forest as a postdoc in the IBP era.
02:25
Dr Swanson remained involved at Andrews throughout his career, facilitating
02:29
the geology-ecology interface, serving in leadership roles, such as the
02:34
principal investigator of the LTER program, and fostering the more recent
02:40
interface across the arts, humanities and sciences, through the establishment
02:44
of the long term reflections program.
02:47
Thank you, Dr. Swanson for taking the time and talking with me today.
02:52
So if you're ready to begin,
02:57
the first collection of questions are in regards to
03:02
your personal philosophy and practice of science.
03:05
I'll inquire about your perception of an ecosystem and your personal
03:09
take on scientific research, if you're ready to begin?
03:12
Yes
03:14
My first question I'd like to ask is, how would you define an ecosystem?
03:20
I consider an ecosystem to be a collection of organisms,
03:25
interacting with their environment.
03:29
So ecosystem sciences is about the components and their interactions.
03:37
So that entails both the biotic and the abiotic is that correct?
03:41
Correct.
03:42
And it can be tiny or it can be huge.
03:44
Okay, multiple scales.
03:49
How would you describe the nature of an ecosystem?
03:52
Are ecosystems static or dynamic or are they chaotic or orderly, brittle, fragile?
04:02
I consider ecosystems to be well, most ecosystems at least, the one's I'm
04:08
interested in are quite dynamic and there may be rhythms and patterns within them,
04:16
but they also can be very changeable.
04:24
As a follow up question, what are some of the forces that make an ecosystem dynamic?
04:31
Well, I think there are endogenous and exogenous forces.
04:36
So there's change that is wrought by the processes and interactions going on
04:43
within an ecosystem, over time, but also the ecosystems may have change agents
04:52
and impinge on them in ecological terms.
04:56
So we'll talk about disturbances.
05:02
But as a physical process person, I think it's important to look at those
05:10
disturbance processes in their own right.
05:15
And so disturbance has too negative a connotation for my persuasion.
05:23
But anyway, endogenous and exogenous drivers of change.
05:29
And I know that in the history of ecology, there was a particular point in time when
05:34
people perceived ecosystems to strive towards a static or complete stage.
05:41
Is that correct, would you say that that viewpoint still holds or has
05:46
that changed considerably today?
05:50
Well, the systems that I'm most familiar with, the systems I work
05:54
with including forest systems,
06:01
I don't believe there's much belief in a climax state.
06:07
You know, you may see successional processes and endogenous processes
06:13
proceeding, and have a sense of successional trajectories, but
06:23
disturbance events of a pulsing sort, fire, flood, or
06:29
drought may trigger change.
06:35
But also we're now very aware that the climate and the whole context is
06:42
changing, atmospheric chemistry, ocean chemistry, as well as temperature
06:51
and so everything is on the move.
06:56
I think that's widely accepted.
07:02
Can you describe your theoretical philosophical background and how
07:08
that is applied toward your science?
07:11
Well, that's an interesting question.
07:13
I don't feel that I operate with an explicit theoretical
07:19
or philosophical perspective.
07:25
I did take philosophy of science courses one each as an
07:29
undergrad and as a grad student.
07:33
I've been interested in it for a long, long time.
07:42
As I think will come out with the following questions, my own
07:47
practice of science has been dominantly of a descriptive,
07:53
observational, natural history sort.
07:56
So,
08:00
by subject matter and inclination, that's sort of where I come out.
08:15
How would you describe your scientific style?
08:18
So you were saying it's more observational rather than experimental.
08:22
Can you elaborate a little bit on that?
08:27
Having a background in geology, I'm interested in earth,
08:34
and especially Earth surface
08:39
processes and histories and I tend to think at broad scales and I am not
08:49
presumptuous enough to expect to conduct experimentation at those broad scales.
08:57
It's been interesting for me to learn about adaptive management and to undertake
09:03
and collaborate with other scientists and land manager colleagues of the Willamette
09:09
National Forest try to undertake an adaptive management project and you
09:15
know about 30,000 acres with cutting patterns distributed over time with
09:25
intensities that represent some emulation of the historic disturbance regime.
09:31
So those are not experiments in the sense of standard agronomics,
09:39
you know practices of having small plots that you really have a lot of
09:42
control over, and you have multiple treatments that you apply randomly.
09:48
So
09:51
it's not experimentation in that sense, but there I have dabbled
09:55
in some real world manipulations
09:59
of the landscape to learn how it's functioning.
10:04
For the most part I'm in the observational descriptive camp.
10:12
That's as a scientist, you know, as a research administrator leader, like in
10:17
the context of a Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the Andrews,
10:24
then I'm there to try and facilitate a broad portfolio of approaches
10:32
and not hold one above the others.
10:40
Because we have an interdisciplinary group and the disciplines have
10:46
different cultures of philosophical approach to science, we're dealing
10:53
with a big messy system and especially by dealing with it over time.
10:59
Now we've had about 50 years of ecosystem research at the Andrews.
11:05
and some of these studies, like the experimental watershed studies, began
11:09
in 1952, so we're pushing off towards 70 years of presence and direct observation.
11:21
Then we're in there with the whole system and we're part of it, and we're
11:26
watching it over these longer timescales.
11:29
Then the reconstruction work on fire history and landform
11:33
history extends back, fire history
11:40
about eight centuries back and it extends back in
11:47
landform time scales for tens of thousands of years.
11:53
Then the rocks, we're talking about tens of millions of years.
11:58
So
12:01
anyway, those are sort of the scales in which I try and operate, both as a
12:09
scientist and as a science facilitator.
12:14
You bring up some interesting points that I want to go back to.
12:18
So adaptive management, if you could describe a little bit more about how
12:21
that's distinguished from experimental.
12:24
There's still, if I'm understanding this correctly, there's still some sort
12:28
of manipulation of the land, but the learning process is more open ended.
12:33
Is that correct?
12:34
Right, this is a
12:38
set of concepts.
12:41
I think the concepts that have their roots in Carl Walters, and C.S.
12:46
Holling from about 50 years ago.
12:50
They were in British Columbia at that time, and it deals with large,
12:54
complex, natural resource systems such as fisheries and forestry operations.
13:03
Kai Lee wrote a seminal book, The Compass and the Gyroscope,
13:09
for the Columbia River system.
13:14
They're big and complex and they're not replicable and so
13:20
there's a cycle of assessment and practice adaptive management.
13:25
My impression is that institutions and communities of practitioners have a hard
13:35
time keeping it going for very long.
13:40
Certainly, much shorter time periods than the time scales on which the
13:47
ecosystem or the natural resource system that they are trying to understand
13:54
operate and the social context of laws and things like that.
13:59
We have a real hard time keeping it going and we've certainly experienced
14:04
that in the context of the Andrews.
14:06
It's one of 10 adaptive management areas under the Northwest forest
14:11
plan which went into effect in 1994.
14:16
We had funding and we're supposed to do adaptive management projects.
14:21
We undertook one, the Blue River Landscape Project, which I just mentioned.
14:28
For about 30,000 acres, but we sort of have failed to extend it.
14:39
Partly because of lack of funding, but also because environmentalists
14:44
sort of took it down, because it involved cutting a forest.
14:49
So anyway, I do believe adaptive management is an interesting
14:54
and important ideal approach and it keeps getting invoked,
15:02
but I can't point to a case where we've stuck with it for even 30 or 40 years,
15:08
which is a pittance relative to the time scale of the phenomena in question.
15:20
If you could speak more about reconstruction work, I imagine
15:23
that has a lot to do with your background as a geologist and a
15:26
natural historian, is that right?
15:28
And that type of work is specialized towards those fields, is that right?
15:28
Yes.
15:32
Can you describe that a little bit, so it's about reconstructing
15:35
past physical processes?
15:38
Yes, so a couple of the areas that I've worked on, have to do with say fire
15:46
history, and that work began in the
15:54
70s, at a time when the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management were
15:57
busy creating lots of beautiful stumps.
16:01
The federal policy was to log the old growth and convert it to plantations
16:06
and I was struck by these amazing records in the tree rings on the stumps.
16:15
So
16:17
I enlisted a series of students,
16:22
to help with that work and, as I mentioned, we found trees
16:29
up to over 800 years old.
16:33
And other people did some of this as well.
16:36
And so there have been about
16:41
10 landscape scale fire history studies using dendrochronology mostly counting
16:47
on stumps, but also the higher quality work of taking increment cores and
16:53
sanding them and then counting the rings in the laboratory under a microscope.
16:59
Rather than crawling across a sappy stump and ants crawling up your sleeve and in
17:07
the outer rings, you may have, you know 40 rings to the inch and you have a hand
17:14
lens and you're trying to read them and it's very difficult to get a good reading.
17:19
But, anyway, so we went around and counted tree establishment dates and also scars
17:30
that we interpreted by their morphology to be of fire origin, and we could then
17:36
reconstruct the patterns of fire over time and over space and we could find places
17:44
that hadn't had a fire for 6, 7, 8 hundred years and other places which burn much
17:52
more frequently, maybe every 75 years.
17:55
So that's one form of
17:59
interpretation of the past.
18:01
Then on the landforms we study the different types of landforms,
18:10
which we can see in LIDAR or topographic maps or aerial photographs and then we
18:20
have some dating techniques such as using the trees, a tree ring aging techniques
18:27
or looking at deflection of roads by
18:35
landslides, then we're constrained to the history of roading in that landscape.
18:40
In
18:43
using tree rings, then we're constrained by the history of
18:46
fire and other disturbances.
18:49
But also we have a little bit of Mazama volcanic ash from the
18:53
eruption of Mount Mazama creating Crater Lake about 7000 years ago.
18:56
So, if we see a blanket of Mazama ash, in a particular arrangement on some
19:03
old landslide deposits, we believe that that landslide had created
19:09
those landforms by 7000 years ago.
19:14
We could see glacial glacially carved landscapes and from work elsewhere
19:19
in the region, we know something about the time scale of that and
19:23
we can use radiocarbon dating.
19:24
So, you're, you're using a great variety of techniques that you have to build up
19:31
over time, build up your perceptions.
19:37
This gets to something I was going to bring up a little bit later, but
19:40
I'll go ahead and stick it in now.
19:43
An important influence, in my thinking and
19:52
my partner Julia Jones professor in geography, uses this in field
19:57
course also, is the work of T.C. Chamberlain with a seminal paper on
20:04
multiple working hypotheses, which you can apply in field observational
20:11
circumstances.
20:13
When you say, I'm starting to think that the world works this way, you
20:19
know, in the fire history or in landform history or the geologic sphere, or a
20:26
whole bunch of other things, but I want to keep my mind open to alternative
20:34
explanations, so you hypothesize that this sequence of events happened, but
20:42
it could also have been a different sequence, so there'd be hypothesis one,
20:46
hypothesis two, and hypothesis three.
20:49
And then you can ask if one is more likely than two and three.
20:55
When I go around the bend and see another outcrop where I go over and that hillside
20:59
and there's a rock pit over there and I'm going to see some rocks over there,
21:03
I expect to see thus and so and it would argue in favor of hypothesis one,
21:12
rather than hypothesis two or three.
21:14
So it's important to not lock in on one explanation and then see every new piece
21:22
of information, try to tweak it in your perception of it in such a way that
21:29
it supports some favorite hypothesis.
21:32
You need to stay open and stay critical.
21:39
And so there would be maybe some circumstances with the multiple
21:42
working hypotheses, where multiple of them are shown to be true
21:46
or evident in your inquiry?
21:50
Yes, in the course of your work.
21:52
You may have alternative hypotheses and they are not resolvable.
21:59
You tend to lean towards one or the other.
22:02
And when you get a chance to learn something new about the system,
22:11
you take it in.
22:13
For example, when I was first working out at the Andrews on geology and
22:20
the landforms in the 70s, we had very crude topographic information.
22:26
We had an inch-to-a-mile topographic maps from the U.S. Geological Survey with 80
22:31
foot contours and you're under all this forest cover, almost 300 feet high, and
22:41
the trees growing down in the valley say or water and better soil so they grow
22:46
higher and the trees growing and the ridges weren't so high, and most of the
22:50
maps were made as contours on the tops of the trees, rather than on the land itself
22:56
because of the techniques that were used in the early map topographic map making.
23:02
And so I did the best I could, working with some others, but then
23:10
along comes LIDAR [Light Detection and Ranging] remote sensing technique which
23:16
gives you a resolution down to a meter or two and all of a sudden, voila.
23:22
It's like a naked landscape and all these deep...
23:26
What year was that?
23:30
I think the first one we got for the Andrews was about 2007.
23:37
The technology existed earlier, we didn't get it right off the bat.
23:43
So anyway, our views can change, our thinking in the Andrews and
23:51
the history, you know, can change.
23:54
This is a sort of a sidebar,
23:59
drivers of change of ideas.
24:03
You know,
24:06
changes in science,
24:10
new technologies, new techniques, new fads or themes,
24:19
major disturbance events like the eruption of Mount St. Helens or the '96 flood, or
24:24
now these fires that are really proximal and actually encroaching in the Andrews.
24:31
That triggers a flurry of critical thinking, where you can sweep
24:35
in bits and pieces of ideas and knowledge into more synthetic efforts
24:43
catalyzed by a major disturbance.
24:46
And the third driver of change falls in this societal realm, social forces
25:00
of various sorts.
25:03
So they're gradual changes, but then some changes will be punctuated, punctuations
25:11
of abrupt change as some people have put it, you know, like being out in
25:18
the '96 flood is like "decades of boredom punctuated by moments of chaos."
25:24
And
25:30
I also want to go back a little bit on the whole reconstruction approach.
25:35
So that's sort of being a geologist has informed your approach to science.
25:39
And I know from, you know, attending some geology lectures, is that the Earth
25:44
moves quite a bit right when you sort of scale to the deep past and so I'm
25:51
interested in how that's formed your perception of the right now?
25:55
Do you see the world differently after your training as a geologist?
26:01
How do you perceive the current state of things?
26:07
Well, it's been interesting.
26:12
I see it as
26:17
the earth is a work in progress.
26:19
It's always changing the you know plate tectonics, or, you know, the
26:28
reversal of the magnetic polarity.
26:33
I had a big indulgence in that as a grad student to go into the Galapagos
26:37
and using paleomagnetism to try to interpret the geologic history
26:42
of three volcanic islands there.
26:47
In a really interesting case has been Mount St. Helens with its
26:52
big abrupt monstrous eruption.
26:58
And then interacting with ecologists and land managers and the public sector.
27:05
So
27:07
there was an interest in ecological
27:14
re-storation and re-covery.
27:17
And parts of the landscape were so profoundly changed
27:22
that they aren't the Re-word.
27:26
Re-hyphen word isn't suitable.
27:31
[the land is not returning to a former state] It's a misperception unless
27:34
it's very narrowly defined, you know.
27:36
There's a lake that was here before and there was a population of fish species
27:42
X in this lake, so we could restore the
27:49
population of that species to that lake.
27:52
So narrowly defined, you can go back, but for the most part, the
27:57
world is marching on biologically and geophysically and there's no going back.
28:04
We need to accept that.
28:06
And so, this came up, even in the title of our first book on the
28:10
volcano ecology of Mount St. Helens.
28:14
We called it ecological responses to the eruption not ecological
28:24
restoration or recovery or
28:30
some re-word like that.
28:33
Language is an important factor in how it shapes the way that we think about things.
28:37
Oh, it's huge, and I always had a notion of that, but now that
28:42
I have been hanging with the
28:46
amazing writers for 20 years
28:50
it comes home all the more.
28:53
It's all the more clear.
28:56
And then so with that perception of your reconstruction and long
29:01
term history approach, how does that knowledge inform the future?
29:08
How can that knowledge inform our future management and future perception
29:12
of where the earth is going towards?
29:20
I think that pertains probably in several ways.
29:24
I haven't doped it out, say well here are three ways.
29:30
But, you know, first of all, I think a big
29:36
issue is
29:40
to dispel false hopes.
29:46
You know, we're not going back.
29:48
Hey guys, we're not going back
29:53
and
29:56
we have to accept that.
29:58
And so the question is, how do we move forward?
30:02
I do believe that history gives us a lot of clues about how the world
30:10
is likely to behave in the future.
30:13
In
30:17
fact, that's a major theme of some of the stuff that like Julia and Charlie
30:23
Crisafulli, Mount St. Helens ecologist, and I've been on to when we've gone
30:28
down to Chile for a dozen years now to visit sites where three volcanoes that
30:35
have had eruptions since 2008 and then we can compare that with St. Helens.
30:41
But, also, we've looked at a lot of the other records of volcano
30:46
ecology around the globe, looking at what are common themes and what
30:54
patterns and processes tend to be peculiar to particular types of eruptions
31:04
or climatic and vegetation type contexts and things like that.
31:09
So,
31:12
I think we have a lot to learn from history, but we have to
31:17
use that information judiciously and be open to surprises.
31:23
Because patterns may demonstrate, but there's also a lot of irregularity
31:28
and unpredictability as well.
31:32
And so next question we've sort of touched on this a little bit, but
31:36
maybe if we can explicitly talk about how have your disciplinary roots as a
31:40
geologist influenced the development of your particular style of science?
31:44
And then maybe if I can add because your particular trajectory is unique in that
31:49
at one point, you turned to not just geology, but also the geology and ecology
31:53
interface and how may that also inform your particular approach to science?
32:02
I
32:05
have those geologic roots and so that's heavy to
32:13
observation.
32:18
And like, if you're mapping geology in the Cascade Mountains and it
32:25
is 98-99% covered with trees, you have to be a little loosey-goosey.
32:35
I mean
32:38
you're telling some pretty big stories without very much data.
32:45
And so
32:48
I think that's an important part of it.
32:55
And I felt like I took my geologic instincts into geomorphology trying to
33:03
understand the landform history in the Cascades and in the
33:08
other places I've worked.
33:10
And then I took the same perspectives into trying to
33:13
understand and map the fire history.
33:18
So,
33:24
another thing because of my geologyness
33:31
and tying in with the ecologists
33:36
in the early 70s, I was trying to figure out how we could interface.
33:42
And so I
33:45
gave that some thought and made a table that had
33:55
timescales from days to 10s of millions of years about half a dozen timescales
34:08
sequentially.
34:08
And then what phenomena are occurring in the geological and ecological
34:14
worlds at each of these timescales.
34:19
And then, if you're trying to think about geo-eco interactions, which is
34:23
the dominant theme for me, you can start out at a particular time scale.
34:31
You're not going to learn a lot if you're dealing with really
34:38
fast processes in one realm and very slow processes in the other.
34:42
You sort of need to get your thinking lined up at similar scales, but then
34:47
also ask questions about what's happening at the next fastest or the next slowest
34:54
scale of change in each of those realms and then how those things interact.
35:00
I was thinking about this a lot in a time period when hierarchy theory was a major
35:09
perspective in ecosystem science and there were some treatises on hierarchy theory.
35:19
Back at that time, I was having this personal experience with it.
35:24
How does my work on the geology with rocks millions of years old, how can I
35:30
interact with these tree physiologist measuring dew point 10 minute intervals?
35:37
So we were disjunct at time skills of interest, but then once we spend more
35:43
time together, like with the stream ecologists and the forest ecologists
35:47
on wood in streams and shaping stream ecosystems, we needed a geophysical
35:56
perspective, we needed the forest ecological perspective, and we needed the
35:59
aquatic stream ecological perspective.
36:02
Then we had to come together and talk in the time scale of vegetation succession
36:08
and flooding and all this kind of stuff.
36:13
So, that's been a really important
36:19
thing for me in our group, because coming in as a geologist, I was sort of an
36:30
outsider, but I tended to have a broad picture and I was very interested in
36:39
hierarchy theory and systems ecology, which was big as International Biological
36:45
Program was starting back in the 1970s.
36:51
Systems ecology, I really grooved on those bigger
37:01
integrative views of the world.
37:04
And then I would try to make simple diagrams of how some of these interactions
37:10
occur like forest-stream interactions of which large wood is one example, then we
37:19
have multiple processes at that interface.
37:24
The Andrews has been notable in how that
37:30
work in that world of forest-stream interactions has grown, evolved,
37:35
and new forms of interactions have been realized over time.
37:44
It turns out to be very important in land management because if
37:47
you're going to whack the trees in the uplands, how are you going
37:49
to protect the aquatic resources?
37:53
But it isn't just a protection thing because the aquatic ecosystem has taken
37:57
a lickin' and kept on tickin' in the case of floods and fire and so forth.
37:58
[The phrase "takes a licking and keeps on ticking" was
38:02
part of an advertisement for a brand of wristwatch long ago.] So they're both
38:04
basic and applied aspects to the work,
38:10
which gets to your very last question.
38:13
Yes, and so just a couple of follow ups.
38:17
Do you mind giving your personal sort of definition of
38:21
observational approach to science?
38:23
I know we all have an idea of what that means, but I'd like to hear
38:29
your perspective and definition.
38:31
Well, I was intrigued.
38:35
I asked you in our previous conversation about giving definitions
38:40
of some of the terms here.
38:41
So, preparing to have this conversation with you, I looked
38:45
up Natural History, the term.
38:48
And I think that's very germane to the whole LTER scene in general because
38:58
this year we're 40 years into LTER and some sites are like the Andrews that
39:08
it started in the [IBP] International Biological Program era [started a
39:12
decade earlier] . So we're 50 years out, so we're living natural history.
39:21
The work at the Andrews is more than a collection of finely tuned experiments.
39:30
So I looked up natural history and it said it's scientific study,
39:37
it's observational rather than experimentation and it's presented in
39:43
popular rather than academic forms.
39:47
So, experimentation in this rigorous sense, you know, as you tweak the
39:56
ecosystem in some prescribed ways and see how it performs and you learn from that.
40:05
So observational work does not involve that intentional tweaking
40:16
with random assignment of treatments and replication, so forth.
40:19
We do have experimental watersheds and I've done studies with them,
40:26
but they don't meet rigorous standards of experimentation,
40:35
but we still learn from them.
40:39
So observation, you go out and observe and think a lot and argue,
40:46
you know, and then talk it out.
40:51
And what would you say the fields of ecology consist of?
40:54
Is it a mixed bag or does it lean towards one approach over the other?
41:03
I'd like to think it's a mixed bag and it's good to be mixed.
41:08
You know, when I
41:11
first started out, you know, the ecologists
41:16
in the '70s say there was the term "physics envy".
41:24
If we're going to make this a serious science, we have to be really experimental
41:33
and that's the way to really learn about processes.
41:39
And,
41:42
as a matter of fact, one member of our group said that recently.
41:49
And he was promoting certain kinds of experiments.
41:56
Well, that's fine, but that isn't all we should be doing.
42:03
That seems like a common trend across so many disciplines is the
42:08
need to become more physics-like.
42:10
I don't know why, but it's a common trend.
42:14
You see, in both the social sciences and the natural sciences.
42:17
Well, I'm very concerned about social sciences.
42:22
We have a daughter who just got her PhD in human dimensions of natural resources.
42:28
As she's trying to get some papers passed by her own committee and
42:33
co-authors, there's all this stuff about you having to start paragraphs
42:40
with theory, that theory says, "blank".
42:44
Well, there seems to be
42:51
excessive science envy in some of that way of communicating.
42:58
So
43:02
it's sort of concerning.
43:04
And it's interesting because I would say that when your topic of study
43:10
is something like an ecosystem or a culture, which is defined by an
43:16
immense degree of unruly complexity.
43:19
Right?
43:20
So in that regard, maybe there are pros and cons in trying to apply a
43:25
set of methods that are supposed to be for something that is reductionist,
43:30
you know, which is the topic of what physicists study and what are some of
43:34
the potential repercussions of that.
43:41
Yes.
43:43
And I'm certainly not attuned to the discussions of this topic in the
43:51
social sciences and in anthropology.
43:54
I
43:57
think it's good to hear different points of view and have them all out there on the
44:01
table and not get too uppity and wonky.
44:05
That one is really going to lead to truth and the others aren't, I don't
44:10
believe that for a minute, you know.
44:14
But I would think it's good to have a diversity of approaches.
44:17
Certainly, in terms of funding would you say that one approach
44:22
is more favored than the other
44:37
or is it evenly distributed?
44:39
Well,
44:41
that's a very good question.
44:54
It all depends on where you're trying to get your money from.
44:58
You know, having worked on the arts and humanities now for quite
45:02
a while at the Andrews and viewing it more broadly and collaborating
45:08
with some others in trying to get NSF funding for arts and humanities,
45:20
historically, like 10, 20 plus years ago.
45:28
In the 80s and
45:35
90s, we were getting a lot of money from National Science Foundation to
45:38
do science-science, you know, and the more scientific it appeared, the
45:44
more experimental, for example, the more modeling was incorporated, the
45:50
trendy real science kind of stuff, the easier it was to get funding.
45:58
Yeah, observational kind of stuff isn't as expensive and
46:06
we sort of went ahead and did it anyway.
46:10
Then, when something wild happens like the eruption of Mount St. Helens,
46:18
most of us weren't up there doing any experimentation, a few people
46:21
might have been doing some stuff.
46:24
Just telling a story of what the hell happened is huge, observational stuff.
46:31
So anyway,
46:36
let's see, what was your question?
46:39
I'm going to need to get a glass of water, juice or something.
46:43
Sure, should we take maybe between a five to 10 minute break?
46:49
Sure.
46:49
Five is fine.
46:52
Okay, we'll meet back in five minutes.
46:54
Okay.
46:55
So, should I'll just leave this on.
46:59
Yeah, I'll quit the recording and you could leave the video on.
47:02
Okay,
47:09
so before moving to the next question, I want to sort of ask
47:14
and get into the nitty gritty.
47:16
If you can define the difference of what makes observational,
47:18
observational and experimental
47:24
[science]
47:24
. Well, the key I think is manipulation of the world and of course that
47:31
occurs in all kinds of ways.
47:34
Observational work you're not manipulating.
47:41
Okay so that's the key difference.
47:44
Okay,
47:46
so for you personally what is your strategy in developing
47:51
a research question?
47:52
How do you come to a research question.
47:59
Boy.
48:06
That's very difficult to
48:11
answer.
48:14
I do think that my brain is pretty adventuresome and
48:24
I think my question is, maybe I always have the same question.
48:31
How does the world tick?
48:34
You know how, how is stuff working?
48:37
But not in a physics kind of way.
48:43
You know, I have science colleagues who will want to figure out what the
48:49
shear stress is in this stream and will be doing calculations - back
48:53
of the envelope calculations.
48:56
That isn't my style.
48:59
Also, like with the arts and humanities, for example, it's
49:04
just, let's launch off and do some stuff in a different kind of way.
49:10
And, usually, at an interface that we've not cultivated, you know.
49:17
So I like interfaces and just go hang out in the interface and see what comes
49:24
up, you know, so, geology-ecology, science-land management, biophysical
49:34
science-social science, you know, I worked with social scientists, especially
49:41
when we were in the forest wars.
49:45
And
49:51
now science-arts-humanities.
49:53
So
49:56
I don't feel very question driven,
50:03
I'm just trying to figure stuff out.
50:11
And it goes with your openness to surprises.
50:14
Is that correct?
50:16
Yes.
50:20
Or like the Chile stuff on volcano ecology, it's adventure travel,
50:26
it's going into new settings and
50:37
in forming new relationships, collegial
50:43
relationships.
50:49
My next question, what are your thoughts in regards to objectivity
50:54
and scientific research?
51:01
Well, I do think we need to be objective and open and if we are
51:06
collecting data, we need to do our best job in collecting quality data.
51:14
Explaining how it was collected and sharing it, so that others
51:22
can do with it as they wish.
51:26
That's a big theme in LTER.
51:29
And in the early days of
51:34
LTER, it was very challenging to overcome cultural hurdles within
51:40
the science community to have public dollars mean public data.
51:47
These are not personal studies, although there are some protections for some time.
51:55
For example, masters students, if
52:00
they generated a bunch of data, they should have adequate time
52:06
to publish it before it becomes public.
52:12
So, anyway, I think we need to be objective and careful, but open.
52:20
As a researcher, how do you use the scientific method to find the truth?
52:26
Well, what's the truth?
52:29
First of all, I
52:35
hope that in what is the scientific method, I do think hypothesis
52:45
formulation is important,
52:51
but if you're dealing with something like long-term ecological research,
52:57
having hypotheses that are falsifiable is just way too constraining
53:07
for dealing with long range phenomena.
53:12
So I think
53:18
the practice of a scientific culture
53:23
is important, and I wonder about, including the notion of the
53:28
scientific culture in finding truth or more truthful stuff over time.
53:36
Maybe it's like the earth or Mount St. Helens landscape.
53:42
There's no going back to something or going to some
53:45
truth; it's changing over time.
53:48
But, if we use a scientific culture of critical thinking and open sharing of
53:55
the foundational information, that's how we get to more truthful perspectives.
54:07
So would you say that that truth as a concept is more fluid
54:12
and it's a continuous process of trying to pursue truth?
54:18
I think so.
54:26
Alright, so my next question.
54:28
Are there are laws of nature?
54:30
And if so, can you define what a law of nature means?
54:41
Well, I don't think in those terms, although I remember reading
54:45
about it back in college days.
54:51
So I do see laws as very helpful
54:59
descriptions of relationships, the gas laws and things of this nature.
55:07
They may be somewhat scale-dependent.
55:12
They may work well at certain scales and not so well at others.
55:17
So I think they are useful depictions of how the world works.
55:27
And on a personal level, what are your overall motivations in science?
55:34
Is it for curiosity?
55:36
Is it for finding solutions?
55:38
What is the purpose behind conducting science or doing science?
55:42
Well, that's an interesting and important point to me, and especially
55:47
during the forest wars, where there were battles over old growth and
55:51
spotted owls and all this stuff.
55:54
And I was a federal scientist.
55:57
I wasn't supposed to be advocating for an outcome.
56:02
Actually, I was okay with that.
56:05
I think some people, passionate advocates,
56:13
wanted to see people like me, a scientist, you know, advocating for
56:18
old-growth or one thing or another.
56:23
So, I've had this
56:28
interesting career where it was possible to work on things where there was a
56:35
lot of public interest and attention.
56:39
I
56:42
felt that relative to old-growth and natural ecosystems,
56:50
they are powerful parts of the world.
56:55
If you're interested in conservation, for example, I certainly have
57:01
an interest in conservation, if
57:04
we explain that this tree or this stand is 500 years old, 500 years since the last
57:12
major fire and look how complex it is.
57:19
I think the people in general will want to do the right thing.
57:24
You know, they will want to take good care of it.
57:27
So a lot of the things I've worked on, the effects of flooding, the effects of
57:31
logging, roads, sediment, landslides,
57:36
and aquatic habitat and all this kind of stuff,
57:41
I was happy to just go try to figure out what happened and put it out there.
57:47
In public terms, not wonky academic terms, although, I've published science papers,
57:58
but be willing to tell straight stories and let the chips fall where they may.
58:06
In terms
58:09
of lawsuits or legislation or one thing or another.
58:16
And so a lot of the things I've worked on,
58:21
there's been a lot of real-world interest in them, like in
58:25
the case of the volcanoes.
58:27
You
58:31
know, it's about public education and appreciation and learning.
58:36
But then the work in the forests had a lot of conservation and
58:41
watershed management implications.
58:46
And I was fine with having some things that were just very basic,
58:52
and other things that were applied and I really appreciate the American
58:57
taxpayers for letting me do that.
59:05
So your work sort of involves a spectrum.
59:07
Yes.
59:08
And I've always been very amazed at
59:14
the stuff that started out very basic and ended up having
59:18
some real world implications.
59:25
Alright so that concludes our section on the personal level questions.
59:32
Now in this next section, I want to move towards inquiring about different
59:36
traditions and approaches of science on a community level and what role these
59:41
different approaches contribute to the Andrew science community as a whole.
59:46
And so I know earlier you spoke about part of your career at Andrews
59:50
involving being a facilitator and a leader of where you have to coordinate
59:57
between different approaches.
59:58
I think you'll have interesting insights on the community level as well.
1:00:03
So for my first question, what role does natural history play in the
1:00:08
Andrews Experimental Forest and how has that changed over time?
1:00:15
In the spirit of the definition that I picked up off the web, that
1:00:22
natural history is scientific study that is observational rather than
1:00:28
experimental and that is presented in popular rather than academic terms.
1:00:36
I think natural history has been an important part of the Andrews work and
1:00:46
our ecosystem has a lot of natural history manifest in it.
1:00:53
That we have old growth
1:00:58
that has recorded its own history in its tree ring records
1:01:02
and a lot of other record
1:01:05
keeping.
1:01:09
I
1:01:11
just think old growth is natural history, on the stump, on the hoof.
1:01:19
And so,
1:01:23
then I think that, as an earth scientist,
1:01:29
natural history is a bigger part of my personal portfolio than probably
1:01:35
anybody else in the science leadership
1:01:40
[at Andrews] . But others have to do it too in their respective
1:01:51
worlds.
1:01:52
I hope that we always have a good dose of natural history.
1:01:56
When we have big disturbance events, that brings natural history to the
1:02:04
forefront because then we want to pause and say wow how unusual is this?
1:02:12
Has this happened before?
1:02:13
What happened in response to it?
1:02:17
So that's part of having a long-term ecological research site.
1:02:24
And natural history differs from more experimental or top-down
1:02:30
approaches and in that it tells a specific story of a specific place.
1:02:36
Would you say that's true?
1:02:39
Yes, that is true.
1:02:43
But then, especially, if we have things
1:02:50
like detailed observational history of vegetation.
1:02:53
So we have vegetation plots,
1:02:58
all over hell and gone, you know, Cascade Head Experimental Forest
1:03:01
on the coast and up the Rainier [National Park] , and Olympic Peninsula
1:03:04
[National Park] , and so forth.
1:03:06
And we also have experimental watersheds at some other locations, so
1:03:14
these are long-term, rigorous, observational studies where we have
1:03:21
plots or experimental watersheds, but then, as time goes by, disturbance
1:03:30
events will happen and modify them.
1:03:33
And so this becomes a form of a rigorous, observational, natural history type
1:03:42
science, where our observation points, our period of direct observation is
1:03:51
getting long enough that we're starting to see the effects of episodic events.
1:04:00
And so there's this interesting blending of approaches.
1:04:07
And would you say that the observational approaches still carry a great deal
1:04:12
of importance today at the Andrews Forest as they have in the past?
1:04:17
or is there a change occurring at all?
1:04:31
That's a hard
1:04:36
question to answer because I do feel, in general, the
1:04:42
natural history types of work,
1:04:47
that some people are concerned that they're being lost and
1:04:53
being the old botany prof
1:04:59
just isn't trendy anymore.
1:05:01
Or, to have somebody in the faculty who,
1:05:09
you know, led great field trips.
1:05:12
There
1:05:16
have been some efforts
1:05:19
in invigorating natural history.
1:05:21
So I think there are concerns that natural history in the
1:05:25
training and observational science
1:05:33
are sort of dwindling.
1:05:35
I don't have a clear picture on that.
1:05:39
I
1:05:43
would welcome having some people with stronger natural history bent included
1:05:49
within the Andrews program, but we've had a period of turnover of scientists and
1:05:57
I'm not seeing much that are coming on.
1:06:04
What about in the academic realm?
1:06:09
Is there a diversity in trainings for students, aspiring ecologists and whatnot
1:06:15
or would you say that there is prominently one approach emphasized over the other?
1:06:18
I don't really know.
1:06:22
I was never, you know, a full blown academic.
1:06:25
With Julia, she teaches a field course, but only for four days and
1:06:36
that's
1:06:38
a course in natural history, the practice of it.
1:06:43
But I don't think there's very much else offered out there.
1:06:49
And because we have Andrews, she's trying to line up somebody as a successor who
1:06:58
could lead a field course up there.
1:07:00
You have the facilities, you have all of these stories, all of these
1:07:04
places, and different themes.
1:07:05
She does a different theme each year that she's taught it.
1:07:11
So, it's
1:07:13
just an ideal place to try to teach that kind of thing.
1:07:18
And I hope it will persist.
1:07:22
Yeah, I mean I think diversity is important because it touches
1:07:26
on a lot of deep things in terms of how we derive knowledge.
1:07:30
When you were talking earlier about how you come to a research question and it's
1:07:36
about being out there and having the research question come to you, right?
1:07:41
And so if in the other approach, you have your question already in mind, right?
1:07:47
And then you go and seek it, is that so?
1:07:58
This reminds me, the gratitude duet
1:08:04
that I was representing science had with Alison Deming, the poet.
1:08:12
We did it pretty much unscripted twice in public.
1:08:19
Then we wrote some of it down and it's in the book Forest Under Story.
1:08:23
We picked a topic and the one that I liked the best is patience.
1:08:31
Alison thanks the scientists for being so patient in working on a particular
1:08:37
problem or phenomenon for years and years, gradually pulling one layer of
1:08:44
onion skin off after another to really get to the core of what's going on.
1:08:55
I said I greatly appreciated the patience of the writers; I've gone out with them
1:09:05
and we'd sit on the riverbank and we talk about stuff and I'd say, "Well,
1:09:10
time to go, let's go look at some other stuff." The poet would want to stay.
1:09:16
And I'd say, "Well, what are you going to do while you're here?
1:09:19
Do you have a topic you're going to develop or something?" And they'd say,
1:09:25
"I want to stay here; I want to wait for the forest or the
1:09:30
stream to give me a poem." It
1:09:34
was totally open ended patience.
1:09:36
I'm thinking about grad students blowing down from Corvallis going
1:09:42
out to their instruments, downloading the data, tidying it up, hauling
1:09:48
back to the lab, or collecting a sample that's going into the cooler.
1:09:51
"I gotta go right back to the lab and put it in the instrument or into the
1:09:55
computer." You know, they could have had Sasquatch breathing down their
1:10:01
neck and they never would have noticed.
1:10:03
It's
1:10:05
because our science focus can get like this [narrowly focused] and get
1:10:09
totally instrumentation-bound, anyway.
1:10:14
Yeah, it's interesting.
1:10:16
It's interesting, even from my own personal experience, you know, I spent
1:10:20
a lot of time reading about the Andrews Forest through books, through articles,
1:10:24
and then the first time when you took me there and I walked out with this whole
1:10:29
sensational, phenomenological experience of, "Wow, this is so different than
1:10:33
reading from a book." So it's interesting.
1:10:37
We have all these tools that help, but sometimes they actually may inhibit us
1:10:42
from having the full sensory experience of what it is we are trying to understand.
1:10:49
That's why it's so great having the artists and the writers.
1:10:54
Von
1:10:58
Goethe, the natural historian, he definitely loved science, but
1:11:04
he also had some criticisms, he didn't like instruments at all.
1:11:09
He thought that it got in the way of the sensory experience, which is interesting.
1:11:14
I think there's definitely pros and cons to both right?
1:11:17
As long as you don't lose one for the other.
1:11:22
It kind of reminds me in your other oral history, something that you
1:11:25
said that really touched me that I want to hear you talk more about
1:11:29
was having the forest speak to you in terms of finding knowledge.
1:11:33
Do you mind elaborating a little bit on that and what that means to you?
1:11:43
Well, the
1:11:47
forest doesn't use English.
1:11:57
There's been a bunch of work on how forests affect people.
1:12:08
In an interview I did with Jerry Franklin, he talked about
1:12:13
how he talked to the forest.
1:12:15
I said, "Well, did it talk back?" And he said, "Well, not really, but it
1:12:20
was good to hear yourself talking out loud." So, anyway, I feel like when
1:12:26
we've gone out there with groups, including these highly interdisciplinary
1:12:29
groups, and to Mount St. Helens.
1:12:33
These are such big powerful places and amazing things have happened
1:12:42
in these places geophysically, ecologically, and human perception wise.
1:12:52
And it's humbling and I feel like people are more open to communicating their
1:12:59
feelings with one another, but, also, we can just feel at a loss for words
1:13:08
because there is so much there - so many types of organisms doing so many things.
1:13:18
And we've got a bazillion stories and that's only one of the bazillion
1:13:23
of all the stories about all the things that are going on out there.
1:13:27
It's so humbling.
1:13:28
I think that's a big part of it, it's physically humbling and
1:13:34
that was a key discovery.
1:13:37
This relates to your last couple of questions.
1:13:42
You know, what was the big one of the big discoveries from the Andrews.
1:13:49
And I think a major one is, "Wow, this is so incredibly complex and thoroughly
1:13:59
interactive." All of these amazing components rippled through time with
1:14:09
phenomena at all these timescales, and
1:14:15
that was at a time when forest planning was all about viewing the forest
1:14:20
as just a collection of trees that was growing to become two by fours.
1:14:26
How simple can you get?
1:14:29
Ideally no understory, no dead [wood] , no this no that, you know.
1:14:38
So they're just totally different things, but our vocabulary doesn't catch it.
1:14:51
And so that's a very abstract concept.
1:14:53
And yet, I think it was fundamental to stopping them from wacking
1:14:56
that [old growth] all down.
1:14:57
And that was, that was pretty consequential.
1:15:05
So anyway, I forget what you asked.
1:15:08
Oh, yeah.
1:15:12
How does the forest speak to me?
1:15:13
I think
1:15:17
the important thing is to go out there and be quiet and with your eyes open.
1:15:23
And so Lea Wilson's new art piece is now up in Peavy Hall here
1:15:31
[on the Oregon State University campus] . And that's very interesting.
1:15:36
The title of it is derived from a piece of writing from Robin Kimmerer
1:15:43
[Listening to Water] . The title of Leah's piece is "Listening to the Forest".
1:15:55
In our busy short term gratification world that we live in, that's a skill
1:15:59
that we all of us need to relearn.
1:16:01
Yeah
1:16:04
you know, in our world instant gratification isn't fast enough.
1:16:12
Alright, so to the next question.
1:16:16
So we talked a little bit about natural history and observational
1:16:18
approaches on the community level, but how about hypothesis-driven
1:16:22
and experimental research?
1:16:24
How has that contributed to the Andrews Experimental Forest and the science
1:16:29
community and its successes over time?
1:16:35
Oh I think, they've been very important.
1:16:47
You know Mark Harmon's log decomposition study, for example, it does have
1:16:54
replication and
1:17:01
as time goes on, these
1:17:07
experiments get used in different ways.
1:17:18
I'm hoping you will be able to tell us from your past knowledge
1:17:23
of philosophy of science,
1:17:28
what are
1:17:32
the valid
1:17:35
space or constraints on hypothesis-driven research?
1:17:44
If it's to be falsifiable, how can we do that in big, large-scale
1:17:56
systems?
1:17:59
So I do think that trying to formulate hypotheses, real hypotheses and not just
1:18:08
throwing out something that's a throwaway.
1:18:12
You know, hypothesize that a certain method could be used to
1:18:15
do something, you know that isn't about the actual phenomenon.
1:18:21
It's just your throwing the word hypothesis into a proposal, like
1:18:28
a thesis or dissertation proposal.
1:18:31
It isn't
1:18:36
necessarily functional in a philosophy of science and learning
1:18:43
context.
1:18:43
So I think we should try to do those things, but it's actually
1:18:48
very difficult, I think.
1:18:51
Well, I think that a difficult component, which is a key component, is replication.
1:18:56
Right?
1:18:58
Replicate certain circumstances in the forest, which is undergoing
1:19:00
constant dynamic change.
1:19:03
You know, like working in
1:19:07
an LTER network, generally leaders of sites go to periodic meetings
1:19:17
and a site will host the meeting.
1:19:20
So I remember going to the Shortgrass Steppe site outside
1:19:24
of Fort Collins, [associated with] Colorado State University.
1:19:28
You know, their vegetation had this stature [using fingers to show
1:19:31
about one foot] or to Cedar Creek [LTER site] in Minnesota, where
1:19:36
they were doing plots with different numbers of species within the plots.
1:19:42
The plots might be two meters by two meters or something like that.
1:19:46
They had grad students out there weeding them and installing stuff.
1:19:53
They could go manipulate the system,
1:19:57
but we've got big old trees, even in our plantations,
1:20:01
they're still pretty damn big.
1:20:05
So we do do experiments and have plots and treatments that are
1:20:12
big, you know, for many acres,
1:20:18
but it's big and it's messy.
1:20:22
And if you're doing it for a long time, then you get a windstorm or you get
1:20:26
heavy snow that brings the trees down, or a fire or one thing or another.
1:20:31
So physical scale and temporal scale are big challenges.
1:20:38
That
1:20:42
becomes clear when you see what people are doing at other LTER sites
1:20:46
where it might be more feasible.
1:20:52
What role does ecosystem modeling or modeling in general have at the Andrews?.
1:20:58
That's a very interesting question and there's long been a push to do
1:21:02
modeling and some people do a lot of modeling, such as Mark Harmon.
1:21:11
He does modeling, often in spreadsheets, where
1:21:16
it's a big accounting process, but you have to come up with the equations for
1:21:27
the parameter values for the decomposition rate and stuff like that.
1:21:32
So you know Mark's is one kind of modeling.
1:21:42
So we've never been really big on modeling.
1:21:44
Some LTER sites, for example, do have a major model that they use in all kinds
1:21:51
of ways at their site and elsewhere.
1:21:55
And the site is partly known for that.
1:22:01
But at the Andrews, it's been somewhat less prominent of an
1:22:10
approach than at some other sites.
1:22:12
A key thing I've sensed over the decades is people who are modelers like to crawl
1:22:21
in their own little cubbyhole and just do modeling computer simulation modeling,
1:22:32
or individual scientists may have models that they employ in their
1:22:38
own work and there's been some effort at landscape modeling.
1:22:43
But it's hard to capitalize on the investment in modeling if you don't have
1:22:52
a good social setup so that the people who are not the modelers, but maybe the
1:23:00
experimentalists and the observational scientists, can be interacting with the
1:23:07
modeler over time, so there is group learning.
1:23:10
We often do
1:23:15
not arrange that socially to have good group learning.
1:23:21
So that's an administrative community dynamics challenge.
1:23:28
Do you think that the lack of modeling is solely a communicative
1:23:32
and administrative challenge?
1:23:33
Do you think the landscape also imposes challenges?
1:23:35
I
1:23:37
don't think the landscape imposes challenges, actually,
1:23:42
you know, some of the
1:23:47
modeling that has been of closest interest to me has been the
1:23:51
landscape change modeling, and people have done future scenarios work.
1:24:02
We did it for our Blue River Landscape Study and plan.
1:24:06
So,
1:24:14
we tried to simulate with the Northwest Forest Plan, how it
1:24:20
would play out over the upper
1:24:25
Blue River drainage outside the Andrews over the coming couple hundred years.
1:24:33
Let's depict that and see how the different age classes of forests
1:24:39
are distributed in time and space
1:24:43
for the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:24:45
And then we had this fire history based concept, the disturbance-based
1:24:57
management scheme that had three different rotation lengths and
1:25:00
levels of retention of live trees and we tweaked the riparian reserves.
1:25:06
We made them skinnier, but then have some larger reserves and then we wanted
1:25:13
to compare those two different landscape management schemes in terms of owls
1:25:19
and water and distributions of forest conditions and all kinds of things.
1:25:27
And so in that case, modeling was helpful.
1:25:41
And then the final question for the section, are there any other
1:25:45
approaches to ecological research that we have not discussed and
1:25:49
what are their contributions?
1:25:53
Well, I'm not
1:25:57
coming up with any right now.
1:25:59
You know, there's
1:26:03
landscape pattern people.
1:26:07
There's the tracking of spotted owls and their reproductive success
1:26:13
and decline due to barred owls.
1:26:16
I'm just sort of running through my mind some of the major pieces
1:26:19
of action out there and then wondering, so like the owl tracking,
1:26:30
if
1:26:34
that's observational.
1:26:38
You know, the real interesting thing is Julia's work on
1:26:46
climate warming and the atmospheric landscape.
1:26:56
So you can quiz her on that.
1:26:58
But the cool thing is
1:27:02
she tried to look for climate or a climate warming signal in the records
1:27:08
from the meteorological stations, which is the place for you to
1:27:13
expect to find the relevant records.
1:27:19
However, because the forest grew around the met stations,
1:27:25
they got cooler rather than warmer, but that was a shading effect.
1:27:28
That's [warming] something that was going on, generally in the
1:27:33
region in terms of climate change.
1:27:35
So then she went to the records that the vegetation people and the bird
1:27:44
people had collected on air temperature for completely unrelated reasons.
1:27:52
In the veg plot records, which happened to be about 40 years long, she could see it
1:28:05
[warming] and that was serendipity.
1:28:08
It was observational, but it wasn't observational for the
1:28:13
objectives that then the climate analyst was trying to use it for.
1:28:18
So this is an aspect of having so many people doing so many things over
1:28:23
such a long period of time in the same place, and having the data available
1:28:27
for people to do creative things with.
1:28:32
It's very, very powerful.
1:28:34
So it's sort of observational, but it's, I don't know how to describe
1:28:41
it, it's looking over the shoulders of people in another disciplines
1:28:46
and then pulling out their data and doing something special with it.
1:28:51
And I just actually remembered one more question that I wanted to ask you and
1:28:57
that emerged from our discussion so far.
1:29:00
As your role at a period of time as the facilitator between different people,
1:29:05
different projects at the Andrews Forest, are there any moments or times where
1:29:09
you saw either clashes between different philosophies of science or any some
1:29:15
really cool sort of coordinated work or cooperation intersections between them?
1:29:24
There have definitely been clashes.
1:29:28
I
1:29:33
think they were not
1:29:38
science rooted.
1:29:41
They were matters of poor personal behavior.
1:29:48
People just being jerks.
1:29:54
There's certainly times when people thought more money should go their way and
1:29:58
that's a big challenge of LTER, because, although it sounds like a big pot, you're
1:30:03
trying to have a lot of people involved.
1:30:05
And so it takes a lot of altruism to participate,
1:30:12
especially in leadership roles.
1:30:15
So
1:30:19
dealing with personalities is very challenging and an
1:30:23
interesting thing about it is that
1:30:32
it's a bunch of consenting adults.
1:30:35
You have your home institution like the university or Forest Service
1:30:42
research or the national forests that are very hierarchical systems.
1:30:48
You know, the money and the direction sort of move down through
1:30:51
the system, although it's sort of strange because, as a scientist, you
1:30:57
want to have a lot of independence.
1:31:01
So then you get NSF money from outside that hierarchy.
1:31:06
So, very few people in a big in a community like the
1:31:12
Andrews work for one another.
1:31:16
They're in the different hierarchical systems with different cultures and
1:31:22
then they get some money from in their home institution and then they may get
1:31:27
a share of this NSF money and then in order to make it work, they have to
1:31:33
play in the sand box together and not kick sand into one another's face.
1:31:39
And we're not trained to do that kind of thing.
1:31:44
So
1:31:51
conflicts can arise.
1:31:56
Has NSF influenced one approach over the other.
1:32:01
Is it more experimental-driven?
1:32:04
NSF as a culture?
1:32:09
NSF itself is an amazing institution and it has a small number of people
1:32:14
called program officers who run processes with the peer community.
1:32:21
So
1:32:25
most proposals are evaluated by peers in academia or other places.
1:32:34
Some small proposals for quick hits like, oh, can we give money to tackle
1:32:40
this question or this fire just occurred, may be reviewed by just
1:32:44
a group of the program officers.
1:32:47
So anyway,
1:32:51
you're really dealing with your peer community.
1:32:54
And so
1:32:58
it is important to have your work look validly scientific and not be too woo woo.
1:33:06
You know, so the arts and humanities,
1:33:12
I don't think we've gotten any money directly from Andrews LTER to run that.
1:33:19
It's been private money.
1:33:20
So
1:33:27
it's great to have that independence.
1:33:30
I'm
1:33:33
really impressed by how much we've accomplished
1:33:41
without tapping much NSF money.
1:33:45
I mean, NSF has made some contributions, like we've got some funding for a workshop
1:33:51
across the [LTER] network on the arts and humanities and they hosted two art
1:34:00
exhibits in their building and they had
1:34:05
professional art exhibit installers come in.
1:34:11
I actually went there and worked with those people.
1:34:13
I mean, they
1:34:16
get flown around the world to install the King Tut exhibit when it arrives
1:34:22
in, you know, Paris or something.
1:34:25
And here, these guys in the halls of NSF for the public hanging
1:34:29
up these art pieces from LTER.
1:34:31
It was so cool.
1:34:32
I mean it blew my mind.
1:34:33
You know, but anyway, um, I forget how I got onto that.
1:34:40
Do you envision any chance that NSF would move towards being more supportive of
1:34:46
that, as the culture of academia changes and we realize, more and more, the
1:34:50
importance of not just interdisciplinary but trans-disciplinary collaboration.
1:34:55
Do you think it's moving in that direction?
1:34:59
No.
1:35:02
You know we made a run at two proposals for certain kinds of grants to bring
1:35:08
together communities of inquiry where it seems the time was right to do that.
1:35:22
So you get a grant for four or five years and you can have a few meetings, then
1:35:27
you write synthesis papers and you start collaborating where you've been doing
1:35:30
things very separately, that occurs, for example, soil warming experiments
1:35:38
in the US and in northern Europe.
1:35:45
We applied for two of those early in the Trump era.
1:35:49
We got positive reviews and actually our leader [Mary Beth Leigh, U
1:35:54
Alaska-Fairbanks] had gotten a workshop grant that was hosted
1:35:56
at University of Museum of Art and Environment in Reno, Nevada.
1:36:02
It was an amazing meeting and facility.
1:36:06
That set the stage to write these two proposals and they were highly
1:36:12
positively reviewed, though in the end we didn't get them and in the
1:36:16
end it was probably just too weird for NSF to do something at this time.
1:36:21
Also, NSF had been encouraging some inclusion of the social sciences,
1:36:32
but in the last few requests for proposals for [LTER site renewal
1:36:37
grants] , they've pulled back from that.
1:36:40
So they're getting more sciency and conservative and use your
1:36:46
long-term data rather than open up.
1:36:54
I have
1:36:57
written about
1:37:05
how so many sites are bringing in the arts and humanities and dealing
1:37:10
with the human dimensions of the conservation implications of their work.
1:37:17
But they aren't doing much of it with NSF funding or they have to go do it
1:37:22
with this other funding and there's an instinct in these communities
1:37:26
such as ours to do more of it.
1:37:28
That's why I feel like we need to embrace you and your work, because you're
1:37:35
going to help us know about ourselves.
1:37:40
And I think this ought to go on at a bunch of sites.
1:37:44
I wonder if it's going on at any other site, you know, philosophy
1:37:49
and history of science inquiry.
1:37:56
One comment: Denise Lach, now a retired professor of Social
1:38:04
Science and Public Policy
1:38:08
got some NSF money and she did a paper Lach et al. I think it's 2003 on advocacy
1:38:16
in natural resource decision making.
1:38:18
[title: Advocacy and Credibility of Ecological Scientists in Resource
1:38:18
Decisionmaking: A Regional Study] It's in the Andrews pub [publication] list.
1:38:21
She also went to some other sites and did interviews.
1:38:27
I think in person and maybe via questionnaires at several other
1:38:32
sites, but never published that work.
1:38:36
Some of her co-authors may have published a little bit of it of Brent Steel.
1:38:43
And
1:38:46
it's the one that comes to mind.
1:38:48
I think he has some pubs on our pub list.
1:38:50
Anyway, it has to do with the conduct of
1:38:55
scientists at LTER sites in natural resource decision making and how their
1:39:00
conduct is viewed by environmentalists,
1:39:06
attentive public
1:39:10
and people who are more on the development end of the spectrum,
1:39:13
and the scientists themselves.
1:39:17
And this is sort of related to your whole topic and you might even consider trying
1:39:23
to contact Denise and get her impressions.
1:39:28
The impression I got from her in a casual conversation was that the Andrews was
1:39:33
unusual in how involved scientists were for public policy issues, which sort of
1:39:44
relates to some of your questions and, you know, are you just doing wonky science
1:39:50
or are you out there to serve the public?
1:39:52
It
1:39:55
also ties back to the question of how to use science to
1:39:58
find truth or what is truth?
1:39:59
Right?
1:40:00
Are there different sorts of partial perspectives truths?
1:40:04
It's interesting, the historical separation between disciplines that at
1:40:09
the Andrews Forest, you have a unique situation where you're trying to bring
1:40:14
this separation back into a whole inviting not just interdisciplinarity
1:40:20
across the natural sciences, but also social sciences, arts and humanities.
1:40:23
So I think it's interesting, you know, and how much does that open us up
1:40:30
to understanding the natural world?
1:40:31
When we invite all of these different partial perspectives into the story.
1:40:36
It's an interesting thing to keep looking into overtime.
1:40:41
Alright, so I have just a couple of concluding questions.
1:40:50
What significant ideas have emerged from the Andrew's science community?
1:40:55
How did the science of these ideas evolve in terms of questions and methods?
1:41:04
Well, I address this a bit earlier, of just having a sense of the
1:41:10
complexity of the forest, especially notable in juxtaposition with the
1:41:18
nature of plantation forest, which we were busy and have been busily
1:41:27
creating and managing.
1:41:30
Then the nature of old growth, the nature of forest-stream interactions
1:41:36
in the inextricable linkages between forests and streams.
1:41:46
In the abundance
1:41:49
of biological diversity, abundance of species, and different parts of the realm.
1:41:59
Then right now we're starting to learn what the climate warming signal is
1:42:05
and when it's coming from a seasonal and time of day perspective, which
1:42:10
is a stepping stone to something that hasn't been done yet, which is
1:42:15
trying to figure out what all the ecological responses may be in terms
1:42:20
of organisms' responses or processes.
1:42:25
So
1:42:28
we're just doing all that stuff and it capitalizes
1:42:35
on all the methods that have been used
1:42:40
in the forest.
1:42:43
Are there new methods or unused methods?
1:42:47
I'm sure there are plenty of unused methods, especially with new technologies.
1:42:52
For
1:42:58
example, the air flow Julia has worked up a lot of the existing data, but it's
1:43:05
a little bit of a catch-as-catch-can.
1:43:08
It's difficult to understand the airflow in such a large three
1:43:13
dimensional system, the whole forest.
1:43:19
Then
1:43:21
the arts and humanities, I consider that part of our inquiry.
1:43:26
But I don't know where that's going to go.
1:43:31
I probably said to you several times [that]
1:43:36
part of the my feelings about where the arts and humanities can go
1:43:44
is based on the patience of having seen how the old growth
1:43:50
thing unfolded over 20 years.
1:43:53
We worked in old-growth, not really thinking about it very much.
1:43:58
It wasn't [explicitly] an old growth forest research program for 10 years
1:44:02
[s] , but then we summarized what we thought we knew in '81, and then
1:44:08
[for] the injunctions didn't come down [to stop logging in federal
1:44:11
forest lands of the range of the spotted owl] it for another decade.
1:44:13
So I feel like they're going to be outcomes from the arts and
1:44:18
humanities that I can't imagine.
1:44:22
And I may live to see some of them, but I won't live to see most of them.
1:44:29
Time will tell, I suppose.
1:44:33
Alright, so for my final question.
1:44:35
What do you see as the principles and motivating forces that drive
1:44:39
the Andrews Forest as a community?
1:44:46
I think it's
1:44:50
just keep learning more and learning more.
1:44:55
I haven't heard people actually say this,
1:45:00
but
1:45:03
I think, if you learn more in a place where we already know so much,
1:45:09
the lessons can go even further.
1:45:14
You can put them in a
1:45:17
very rich context.
1:45:23
And it's just a beautiful, beautiful place that I think
1:45:31
sucks us in and we're all honored to get to work there.
1:45:35
It's got a bigger karma that is bigger than any of us.
1:45:40
So it's an honor and a big responsibility to work there.
1:45:46
And I think the same about Mount St. Helens.
1:45:53
Our contributions as individuals or teams of scientists have
1:45:59
felt like the stream team.
1:46:03
Our contributions are going to have a longer life
1:46:08
because of being in those places and people look to those places for stories
1:46:12
about some of these kinds of things.
1:46:16
The identity with us as individuals may be lost.
1:46:20
I see that you know the next generation will come along and sort of
1:46:26
rediscover something and relabel it, but that just means that there's more
1:46:33
momentum and refinement in the ideas.
1:46:38
So these are some of my efforts to
1:46:45
articulate why people come in and will stick with it.
1:46:50
A lot of people come in and don't stick with it.
1:46:53
They want to put their name on their stuff in a separate place so their name
1:46:59
doesn't get lost or they can't handle the social dimension or one thing or another.
1:47:06
So it's not for everybody.
1:47:11
And then before we end.
1:47:13
Are there any last, final thoughts that you'd like to offer
1:47:19
or contribute?
1:47:20
No, I just want to thank you for taking this all on.
1:47:23
I'm very curious to learn from you and what you learn overall as you do this.
1:47:34
Thank you as well for taking the time.
1:47:36
I appreciate it.
