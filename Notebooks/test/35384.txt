Today is February 16, 2020.
00:05
My name is Alice Desai.
00:07
This is an oral history interview with Derrick Travers in Corvallis,
00:10
Oregon, for the OSU History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:15
America Oral History Project.
00:18
Starting us off, can you please state your name, pronouns, and
00:21
when and where you were born?
00:23
Sure.
00:24
My name’s Derrick Travers and I use a mix of he and she pronouns and I
00:28
was born in Olympia, Washington in
00:33
1973.
00:34
When we were corresponding before this, you mentioned you don’t really like the
00:37
term preferred pronouns, which is often the terminology that a lot of people use.
00:43
Would you mind explaining why you don’t really use that terminology
00:47
or what you prefer people to say?
00:50
I think it’s pretty widespread, and I’d say even in inside community, in
00:54
trans and non-binary community, but one of the things that I’ve noticed is
00:57
that a lot of times cis gender people use it only when they think or know
01:03
non-binary or trans people are present.
01:05
It’s kind of like, well your pronouns are preferred pronouns but cis gender
01:10
people’s pronouns are just pronouns.
01:12
To me I’m like they’re just pronouns.
01:15
Whatever pronouns someone uses are their pronouns.
01:18
I think of preference as like an ice cream flavor rather than
01:25
my pronouns.
01:25
They’re not something that I prefer.
01:27
They just are.
01:28
If that makes sense.
01:31
What was your childhood like?
01:35
[Laughs] That’s a great question.
01:40
I grew up in the Northwest.
01:41
I’m one of six kids.
01:44
My parents are very conservative, very religious, and they—like a lot
01:51
of trans kids, I at a pretty young age started to show... I was assigned
02:00
female sex at birth, so I started to show kind of masculine traits.
02:04
We could talk about whatever “masculine traits” are, but
02:07
I think you know what I mean.
02:10
My parents were, they felt
02:15
that was bad and so they would punish me in a variety of different ways.
02:20
It was made very clear to me that that was not okay.
02:24
I hid it.
02:24
I have one brother, but I remember trying to borrow his clothes or wear his clothes.
02:29
I would always get in trouble.
02:32
My parents,
02:36
they worked really hard to give all six of us, they wanted to teach us what
02:43
they would consider morals and ethics.
02:45
I’m grateful for that.
02:47
They worked really hard to give us—like, they would take us camping.
02:50
I cannot imagine taking six children camping, but they would.
02:55
They just would go above and beyond to create these amazing experiences
02:58
and they were also very strict and would physically punish and were very
03:03
rigid about what was and was not okay.
03:08
Growing up in that environment, I got really strong messages like really
03:13
overt open messages that being queer was bad or that being trans was bad.
03:18
Back in the ‘70s or ‘80s, very few people were talking about it, so there
03:21
weren’t very many counter messages.
03:23
I can remember my mom making me go to a school psychologist in elementary
03:27
school because she suspected me of being lesbian and was like you
03:32
know go talk to the psychologist.
03:34
If you are, you can get diagnosed and “fixed” or whatever. But I
03:40
remember the psychologist was like, well, do you like boys? I was like,
03:44
yeah, all my best friends were boys [laughs] . She was like, oh that’s fine.
03:48
She’s straight.
03:49
She likes boys.
03:50
Just that thing of mixing up sexual orientation and gender identity.
03:55
People did it all the time back then.
03:58
I feel like I’m not quite sure—it feels rude to not make eye contact with
04:01
you all, but I’m also thinking in the video it will be super sketch if I’m
04:05
like that [glances around in different directions] . Any advice for me from
04:07
all the interviews that you’ve done?
04:15
Should I
04:20
just look at the camera?
04:20
I’ve never done another interview.
04:20
Just focus on the camera.
04:20
I mean, it’s whatever makes you most comfortable.
04:20
Tofi, maybe I’ll just look at you.
04:21
I apologize because it might be kind of intense, but I feel like I’m
04:25
[makes “ch” sound glancing back and forth between interviewers] . Anyway,
04:28
you can edit that part out [laughs]
04:32
. What were middle and high school like for you in terms of, did
04:38
you find any sort of LGBT support from maybe friends or teachers?
04:42
That is a great question.
04:45
Yeah, there just wasn’t much visibility at all.
04:50
I remember in middle school during our three or four days of sex ed,
04:55
we had an anonymous question box.
04:57
My science teacher was really awesome and I’m guessing she planted a question,
05:02
“Is homosexuality okay?” that’s the word that people use, is homosexuality. Not
05:07
a word that I would use to talk about actual people now. I remember her saying
05:13
yeah, that’s part of the human experience.
05:17
That’s one of the few positive messages I remember.
05:19
This was right in the pitch of the AIDS crisis in the United States and globally.
05:24
So,
05:27
gay people were being demonized.
05:29
People were like, they’re infected.
05:31
This is God’s wrath.
05:32
They’re getting punished for their sexual sins.
05:35
Those messages were everywhere.
05:38
President Reagan was the president at the time, and I don’t think he mentioned AIDS
05:42
except to joke about or make fun of it.
05:44
He baited someone.
05:47
That context was happening.
05:49
I remember the Equal Rights Amendment, which we’re still trying to pass, was
05:53
being debated and I remember my mom saying, because my mom is a badass.
05:58
She’s a strong, proud woman, but I remember her saying, we don’t support
06:02
that because it would allow lesbians the opportunity to marry lesbians.
06:10
It was one of the few messages that I got, one of the few
06:13
mentions of queerness at all.
06:15
I remember I would try to sneak my brother’s clothes and I would
06:20
do this thing of take his clothes, put them in my backpack, leave the
06:24
house, and then change into them.
06:27
My mom somehow caught wind of it and I remember one day she got on the school
06:30
bus and made the driver call my name and made me come off the bus and then
06:37
she was like, I know what you’re doing.
06:38
We’re going to go shopping.
06:39
I’m going to buy you girl’s clothes and I’m going to make you wear girl’s clothes.
06:43
That kind of, I consider it terrorism in an interpersonal, that kind of
06:50
I see you and I’m scrutinizing you.
06:52
You’re wrong.
06:53
You’re bad.
06:53
We’re going to fix you and make you adhere to our concept of
06:58
what your gender “should” be.
07:00
That happened all the time.
07:02
It happened from peers as well.
07:06
I didn’t receive, I think people tried to bully me a lot, but I just was kind
07:13
of like I don’t care what you think.
07:18
I was a good athlete and I was good at school.
07:21
People were like, whatever.
07:22
I guess she’s okay.
07:24
I played a lot of sports and I remember the young women in my team
07:28
just being like pretty relentless and being like, no one likes you.
07:31
No one wants you on our team, but I was good.
07:34
It was like, okay but you do want me on your team.
07:38
I remember at times in my life I was able to look like a boy, which was affirming
07:45
in some ways but also really scary.
07:49
I would always get busted.
07:51
A lot of times when we would go, like I played basketball in middle
07:55
school and we played other girls’ teams, and they would be like why
07:59
do they have a boy on their team?
08:01
They would read me as a boy, which felt really personally affirming, but also
08:05
it caused a lot of trouble because then people would be like she’s not a boy.
08:09
There would just be this dramatic thing with all focus on me.
08:12
I remember the first day of school I had just a stereotypically
08:15
feminine name, so the teacher would be like, is so-and-so here?
08:19
I would raise my hand.
08:20
The teacher would be like, quit fooling around.
08:22
That’s not you because you’re a boy.
08:24
I would have to be like, no that actually is me.
08:27
In some ways it was super affirming to be perceived as masculine.
08:32
I don’t identify as male, but I definitely wanted to be seen as masculine.
08:38
It was affirming in some ways, but also it just caused a lot of scrutiny.
08:44
High school, things were pretty bad at home at that point.
08:48
I was out of the house as much as I could.
08:51
One of my sisters ran away and she was the sister who was closest to me.
08:55
She was my older sister.
08:59
Really protected me from my parents in a lot of ways.
09:02
When she left it was really hard.
09:04
I was going through puberty which was just a nightmare.
09:08
But
09:10
at school, I think because I was “good at it,” like I was involved in clubs
09:15
where I think my teachers liked me because I would work hard and I cared
09:19
and I was curious, and I remember high school was a time—my family is all white
09:25
people and high school was a time when my teachers were trying to open up the
09:29
world and just be like, listen there’s so much... I was raised pretty sheltered.
09:33
My family is pretty white supremist, sexist, anti-immigrant, homophobic,
09:38
transphobic, what I think of as a package deal of awful.
09:45
They tried to teach all that stuff to me.
09:47
High school was a time when I was like, oh wait.
09:49
There’s a big world out here.
09:50
There’s people who are different from me and like me and I can make
09:54
connections across difference.
09:55
I feel really grateful to my high school teachers for really gently just
10:00
trying to be like, hey there’s a world outside of what you’re experiencing.
10:06
I loved playing sports.
10:07
I played soccer.
10:08
I was a goalkeeper.
10:10
My team was really good.
10:11
We went to state.
10:13
That was really affirming.
10:22
Touching on this, did you have any friends in middle school or high
10:27
school who you maybe knew or even maybe just suspected were queer?
10:35
Hmm-mm, nope.
10:37
I think I was kind of a lightning rod, because I was assigned female people knew
10:44
I was “a girl,” but I looked masculine. People called me lezzy or dyke, or
10:49
whatever. Before I even had the words—I didn’t come out to myself until I was 18.
10:55
I didn’t know.
10:56
If you had asked me at any point before that day what’s your sexual orientation,
11:01
I would have been like, I’m straight.
11:03
What are you talking about?
11:05
Because there was no—I don’t even know how to convey it.
11:08
There was no representation.
11:10
There was no one.
11:12
I learned later that one of my grand uncles was a gay man.
11:16
He died of AIDS.
11:17
Nobody talked to me about it.
11:18
No one talked to me about him being HIV positive.
11:21
It was a total wall of silence and I knew that lezzy or dyke was “bad,”
11:29
but I didn’t even know what it meant.
11:32
There was no same-sex dating.
11:34
None of my teachers were out.
11:37
There were rumors about people.
11:40
There was one young man in high school who was out as bisexual and
11:44
he got beaten up every single week.
11:47
The administration was like, well what do you expect if you’re going to be out.
11:49
If you’re going to “flaunt” your sexuality, this is what you get. Those
11:54
are strong messages. Again, it’s not like I knew I was lesbian and was hiding it.
11:59
I think my brain just was like you cannot know this.
12:03
When I did finally come out to my mom, she said, well we’re going to
12:07
institutionalize you and fix you.
12:09
I think there was a part of me that knew keep this under wraps until you turn
12:13
18, because that’s when you’re an adult.
12:17
That’s when you could actually say no.
12:19
I believe her that if I’d come out at any point before then she would
12:24
have, I would have been locked up and “treated,” whatever that means.
12:28
But, no. I think people liked me okay but I didn’t have close friends.
12:33
I had one of my older sisters was in high school with me and my older brother.
12:40
I knew them.
12:43
When I was a junior I met a couple of really good folks in one of my
12:49
English classes, and we all came out as queer when we graduated.
12:53
It was like we found each other, but it wasn’t like, oh
12:58
you’re out as queer as well.
13:00
It was like, there’s something about you that I like, but no one talked about it.
13:08
After high school, what was the reason you chose to attend OSU?
13:13
Good question.
13:14
I had always wanted to be a forester.
13:16
I can’t even explain why I wanted to be a park ranger.
13:19
I wanted to work outdoors.
13:20
I wanted to work with the natural world.
13:22
OSU had a really good forestry program.
13:25
It was close enough to not have to haul all the way across the country
13:31
and at the time there were very few women in forestry, so they offered
13:36
a really excellent scholarship.
13:37
My family was low income, so it was like the only way I was going to go to school.
13:42
I mean, I could have taken out loans, of course, but getting
13:45
that scholarship was a big deal.
13:48
They have a really excellent program, so I was like, sure.
13:52
This will work.
13:57
Coming to OSU, did you feel welcomed and accepted here?
14:03
That’s a good question.
14:05
Umm... I would say no.
14:12
That was a time, I would say junior, senior year of high school and freshman
14:16
year of college was when I really started putting it together of who like who is
14:23
accepted and welcomed here and who is not.
14:27
OSU was struggling so much with racism on campus and they would do these
14:32
foolish programs of like okay, we’ll send students of color out to recruit
14:37
students of color and get them here and then we can say oh look at our numbers.
14:41
But there was nothing retain, to
14:44
be like okay we got you here.
14:46
How do we keep you here as a valued part of the community?
14:52
Overt, clear racist incidents would happen routinely on campus.
14:57
Campus would either cover them up or be like that didn’t happen.
15:02
I can remember one time a young black man was walking under a balcony and
15:09
a white student urinated on him.
15:12
No shit, like felt so free to be white supremacist that
15:18
that seemed like a good idea.
15:20
The university was like, oh he didn’t really mean it.
15:22
It’s not really that big of a deal.
15:24
To me, it’s like if you’re on a campus and you’re getting sent those clear
15:27
messages that “people like you” aren’t welcome, aren’t valued, aren’t part of the
15:30
community, are like other, then it becomes very clear. To me, women were undervalued,
15:40
people of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, older than average students,
15:44
and for sure LGB and I don’t even know if there were other trans or non-binary
15:50
students, but it was really clear.
15:52
OSU I think because of business, engineering, and agriculture was seen
15:56
as a pretty conservative school and I felt like the dominant perception was
16:02
very much like, well, if you’re a cis gender or white, straight man, great.
16:07
Anyone else, good luck.
16:10
Those messages, it was very apparent.
16:13
I mean, I can’t even explain it.
16:14
Back then there were no diversity initiatives.
16:17
There were cultural centers, and we should talk about those, because those
16:21
were strongholds of student resistance.
16:23
We, not always, but we often were successfully together to push back on
16:30
these things that were happening, but I felt like it was you’re on your own.
16:34
Even in the College of Forestry, there were probably
16:37
ten women, if you include me.
16:42
A lot of the guys were pretty great, but the guys who were just overtly
16:46
sexist, or professors that were overtly sexist, it was just like well, yeah
16:50
what did you expect?
16:52
I was like, I expect better [smiles and laughs] . And I still do.
16:57
I think once I came out as queer, I realized I was a lesbian.
17:02
I read a book that had two young women fall in love.
17:06
I remember this lightning strike of being like, oh that’s me.
17:11
That went against every, like anything that I had been raised.
17:16
Back then I think people didn’t think so much about gender identity.
17:20
Being a masculine woman, people would be like, oh you’re a lesbian.
17:24
That’s what’s happening.
17:24
There was no, oh there’s two parts: sexual orientation and gender identity.
17:30
I did identify strongly as a lesbian, so it’s not like I wasn’t one, but I
17:34
wasn’t thinking about my gender as much.
17:36
I came out right before the summer, like a month or two before coming to OSU.
17:42
Then landed here, and was like okay I have all this freedom.
17:46
I can create my life.
17:48
I’m independent from my family for the first time.
17:52
What the hell do I do now?
17:54
It was like this beautiful thing but also hostile.
17:59
I can remember,
18:03
I think it was called GALA back then, Gay and Lesbian Alliance,
18:08
they gave us a brochure that had all the student numbers, clubs and
18:12
different things you could join.
18:13
I remember writing down the phone number but I changed the digits, because
18:17
it was up on a screen or something.
18:19
I was sitting with one of my friends from high school, and I remember—so, it
18:23
was 737, which is probably still in the prefix, and I changed all the digits.
18:27
I made them up one number because I was like, if she looks over and is
18:30
like wait, what are you writing down?
18:31
I felt afraid for her to know.
18:35
I had just come out to myself.
18:37
Then I was like, what am I going to do?
18:40
There are other people like me.
18:42
How do I make these connections?
18:44
School, like, other stuff was happening.
18:47
I was living on my own for the first time.
18:49
I was living in—I don’t know if they have them anymore, but in the women’s
18:52
cooperative, because it was women.
18:55
It was right across the street from the Forestry College.
18:57
I was super convenient in a lot of ways, also terrifying in some other ways.
19:05
I was trying to get my feet under me anyway, and then I remember sometime
19:09
in the spring, maybe this time of year a little later, I was walking
19:13
in the quad and there were these three awesome, brave women who were
19:18
staffing a table and it was Gay Day.
19:21
They had a table with some brochures and there was a little sign on
19:26
a stake, like a wooden stake.
19:28
I remember being like, wow other lesbians.
19:32
Here they are right in front of me.
19:33
I walked up and talked to them.
19:34
While we were talking, some guy walked by and stomped on the sign
19:39
and broke it and just trampled it.
19:41
He just kept right on walking and they were kind of like,
19:46
anyway, and just kept talking.
19:47
I was like,
19:50
that’s not okay.
19:51
People do not, it’s not okay for people to stomp on our signs.
19:55
I respected that they had done, they were all seniors.
19:58
They were all graduating.
19:59
They had been there in an even scarier time than me, the
20:03
previous three or four years.
20:05
I respected that they were operating out of their own
20:08
capability, but I was like, hell no.
20:11
We have got to resist.
20:12
We’ve got to fight to back.
20:14
This cannot be okay.
20:19
The next year, I think the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, I
20:22
think they were all graduating.
20:24
They left.
20:25
I think we changed it to the LGBA.
20:27
We didn’t have a T in it initially.
20:30
I was like, it was me and Brian Parks [phonetic] , who is an amazing
20:36
person, and we were like alright we’re going to have a whole week.
20:39
We’re not going to have Gay Day.
20:40
We’re going to have a whole week.
20:41
It’s going to be in the Quad.
20:42
It’s going to be super visible.
20:44
We’re going to take up a ton of space and we’re going to have so many people
20:47
there, allies or LGBTQ people that no one can—because I had told them the story.
20:52
I was like, no one is going to come stomp our signs.
20:55
So, we
20:59
did.
20:59
I think you’ve touched on this, but it sounded like you wanted to
21:03
talk about it a little more so I wanted to ask—what were the, because
21:11
the centers here are
21:14
pretty well-known, and I think that OSU has gotten pretty good about sharing them.
21:18
But when you were at OSU, how did things like the Pride Center or any of the
21:24
cultural centers, how were they perceived and how did you interact with them?
21:30
That is a good question.
21:32
We didn’t have a Pride Center.
21:34
The Women’s Center was here.
21:37
It had been here for I think decades.
21:38
It had been here for a long time.
21:38
That was the base of operations for lesbian, gay, bi, and queer women.
21:44
Guys didn’t
21:46
come in there so much.
21:48
There was an LGBA, or GALA it was called, Gay and Lesbian Alliance—I can’t remember
21:56
if they had their own office or not.
21:58
Things changed really fast once we started building moment.
22:00
One of the things that I really appreciated is
22:07
I think to some extent cultural centers seem to be a little siloed back then.
22:11
I think there was less working together, but we came together when there was an
22:17
incident of sexual assault, sometimes sexual assault, when there were these
22:23
overt racist incidents which were obvious and clear, like unmistakably a problem.
22:29
Well, one of the things over, I was the first person to be there.
22:34
I think it was the LGB advocate, so the first person in student government
22:38
and I think that was my junior year, so after a few years of us really
22:43
pushing for recognition and visibility.
22:47
We had an office eventually.
22:49
I can’t remember the name of the building.
22:51
It’s about to be torn down, but I can’t recall.
22:55
We had some funding and blah, blah, blah.
22:58
One of the things that happened over the years that I found really
23:02
interesting was more than once the heads of cultural centers or
23:10
people in student government were
23:14
BIPOC [black, indigenous, people of color], and also LGBTQ, but
23:19
would be like, okay I can’t be out but how can we work together?
23:25
We want to work together but I can’t come out.
23:27
It was this interesting thing of realizing, okay white privilege gives
23:31
me this safety even in these really violent and discriminatory times to
23:36
build these networks and to try to—I felt like we all were trying to make
23:42
the university, the campus, and the neighborhoods safer, that you could
23:46
be yourself and actually be on campus.
23:50
It was poignant.
23:51
I was like, damn, it’s really hard to be out.
23:56
It’s really hard to be out.
23:57
I get it.
23:58
I can’t imagine what it would be like to deal with racism
24:00
and homophobia, or transphobia.
24:03
It seems like an incredible burden.
24:05
Working together was satisfying in that way.
24:08
A lot of times it was kind of covert and it was based on,
24:11
yeah, I want to respect you.
24:12
I’m not going to out you, and holy crap.
24:15
Wow.
24:16
We have to work together.
24:17
This is so important.
24:20
Could you touch a little bit more on what you were saying about the living situation
24:24
at the women’s cooperative that was across from the forestry center, because that’s
24:27
not something that really exists anymore.
24:29
Oh, yeah.
24:29
That’d be really interesting to hear a little bit more about that.
24:32
Yeah, I think it was called the Women’s Co-op if I recall.
24:38
I remember being like, cool.
24:40
It’s going to be a bunch of really badass women who really appreciate women and
24:46
I assumed feminist and I assumed people who would be really supportive of women.
24:52
That was not the case.
24:53
I
24:55
think people used to call it something snide, like kind
24:57
of the marriage holding tank.
24:59
People were very interested in traditional femininity and looking to
25:04
get married or get engaged to a man.
25:06
No one was really talking about gay marriage back then.
25:08
It wasn’t even—it might have been a glimmer in some conservative gay person’s
25:12
eye, but it was not a real possibility.
25:16
Wow,
25:18
it was interesting.
25:19
We each had our own study room and then everyone slept on a
25:23
sleeping porch in bunk beds.
25:24
I know, right?
25:27
I see the look on your face.
25:28
It’s like, yep, that really happened.
25:30
I think there were 40 or 50 women.
25:34
There was a kitchen, so there was someone who made food.
25:38
There was cereal and stuff
25:41
you could get, Ramen noodles you could get around the clock.
25:45
We weren’t supposed to sleep in our rooms.
25:48
I had a roommate and she turned out to be incredibly homophobic.
25:52
I had a picture of myself and my best friend from high school
25:56
and she scratched out my face.
25:59
The two of us were us are the only people who had keys to the room.
26:01
Then when the RA or whoever was like, did you do this?
26:06
She was like, yeah.
26:06
She’s a dyke.
26:07
Of course I did.
26:09
It just was overt.
26:09
I can’t even explain to you.
26:10
The RA was like, um... okay, well, maybe you shouldn’t be roommates.
26:16
I was like, yeah, maybe we shouldn’t.
26:18
She maybe transferred out.
26:20
I don’t know if she went to another room.
26:22
I don’t remember, or moved to another place but that night I got my own room.
26:26
Honestly, I slept there a lot of the time.
26:28
I didn’t feel unsafe, but people were freaked out about having an
26:33
out queer woman in the women’s co-op, and they definitely would say
26:36
things, like about me being a sexual predator, which is one of those myths.
26:41
I think it’s still around, but back then that’s how people
26:44
thought about gay people.
26:47
It was kind of like, well, you can’t have kids to make your own new gay people, so
26:51
you just are predators and you recruit.
26:54
That’s part of why with the Lesbian Avengers, one of our slogans was
26:56
we recruit because it was this thing of gays are recruiting.
27:01
We were like, hell yeah.
27:03
Everyone in this room knows that you can’t change someone’s sexual orientation.
27:06
For us, it was an inside joke.
27:09
For a lot of straight people they just thought that that was true and that I
27:12
was going to somehow contaminate all the women who lived in this women’s co-op
27:17
and “make them gay,” which that’s not how it works [laughs] . But, yeah, I assume
27:23
that’s kind of a thing of the past.
27:25
I’m guessing they don’t have those anymore.
27:28
AD: So,
27:31
kind of—start talking about the Lesbian Avengers.
27:35
I know that the first Lesbian Avengers were kind of, I want to say, New York.
27:40
Yeah.
27:44
Because I know that the OSU chapter started in 1992.
27:48
I want to know how you had initially found out about the Lesbian Avengers
27:55
as a bigger movement before then.
27:57
Mm-hmm.
27:57
That’s a good question.
28:00
I’d say in the context of late ‘80s, early ‘90s, again HIV and AIDS were happening.
28:11
Trans people and non-binary people were not on very many
28:14
people’s radars, like at all.
28:15
Kind of zero conversation about that that I was aware of.
28:19
Most of the focus was on gay and bisexual men because of HIV and AIDS.
28:23
So, lesbians and bi women were invisibilized, because of sexism
28:27
and also because this crisis was happening in our community.
28:30
It was all hands on deck.
28:32
People were responding, people were literally dying by the thousands.
28:36
This was this huge thing.
28:41
This was also in Oregon, Oregon Citizens Alliance had started
28:46
trying to pass these measures.
28:49
They first started doing it locally.
28:50
I think Springfield, Oregon was the first place they succeeded.
28:54
They were trying to pass these measures that put in government constitutions
28:58
or documents and, let me see if I can remember this correctly, and
29:02
I think it was “homosexuality and bisexuality.” I remember they were
29:06
so inclusive in a time when LGBTQ communities weren’t, like a lot of times
29:11
bisexual people were invisibilized. But the OCA was all over it. They
29:15
said, homosexuality and bisexuality is unnatural, perverse and they likened
29:21
it to bestiality, sadomasochism, and it’d be interesting to look up a quote.
29:27
I don’t have it in my head anymore.
29:29
They were trying to put this in government charters.
29:32
Ultimately they tried to put it in the Oregon constitution, which
29:35
is just mind boggling right now.
29:37
At the time, it was like well, of course they are.
29:39
That is what straight and cis gender people think of us.
29:45
I was just like well, yeah, that’s the tone and the tenor of when we
29:49
have to move through the world.
29:53
The Oregon Citizens Alliance trying to pass these measures in town and
29:57
cities and then also statewide really made LGB—I’m not going to say trans,
30:03
because again no one was talking about trans people back then—but it made
30:06
gay and lesbian bi people much more visible and subject to a lot of hatred.
30:12
I remember going with one of my friends to, there were these community meetings.
30:20
Back then the media was trying to do this thing of like, “well, we want to show
30:22
both sides.” They would interview either out LGB people or allies and then they
30:27
would interview the only phrase I can think of is gay haters, people who were
30:32
just like: homosexuals are unnatural.
30:34
They should be killed.
30:35
They should be exterminated.
30:36
They should burn.
30:37
That was the media’s idea of “showing both sides.” It was super bizarre.
30:42
Where I’m like, those aren’t two ideologies. That’s an identity and
30:46
hate speech, is how I define it now.
30:52
During that time there was all this violence,
30:56
this state-wide, or sometimes local ordinances were trying to be passed.
31:00
There was all this visibility and violence and I remember some of the queer women,
31:05
or probably would identify as gay women or lesbians, there was a couple that
31:09
lived rurally around campus and someone
31:16
beheaded their dog and put it in their mailbox and then two other
31:21
women, a couple that I knew—these were not out, flagrant lesbians.
31:26
These were women who were very much keeping a low profile.
31:30
Someone broke into their barn and stabbed their horse with a pitchfork.
31:35
There was this harm being directed.
31:37
That’s not even counting, one of my friends got punched on a
31:41
bus in Portland and the driver was like, what do you expect?
31:44
There was just this thing, if you’re going to be visible as gay,
31:48
then you get what’s coming to you.
31:49
That was the dominant ethos at the time for lack of a better word.
31:58
There was a lot of violence and it happened all the time.
32:01
For myself, looking like a masculine woman, every time I left the house
32:06
I was at least verbally harassed if not physically—and some of
32:10
it was benign, people just being like is that a man or a woman?
32:15
What is it?
32:16
Things like it.
32:17
Some of it was very much targeted threats of violence.
32:20
People called me dyke.
32:21
People called me fag.
32:23
People would threaten to kill me.
32:25
People would be like, I don’t know what that is, but I’m going to kill it.
32:28
Literally, if I went to the grocery store to get food something was going to happen.
32:33
It just was like people were so hateful.
32:36
One of the things that happened was there was two really good
32:40
friends who lived in Salem, and they lived in a basement apartment:
32:45
Hattie Mae Cohen and Brian Mock.
32:47
Brian Mock was a man with a physical disability.
32:49
He’s a gay man.
32:51
Hattie May Cohen is a lesbian and also black, or African-American.
32:58
Some hate group, people say Nazi, skinheads.
33:00
I don’t know if people were ever arrested or charged, but they
33:03
threw a Molotov cocktail into the apartment and it caught on fire.
33:07
Both people burned to death.
33:09
This was pre-internet and
33:15
I didn’t even hear about it until someone caught wind of it in New York.
33:20
That’s where the avengers started.
33:22
It happened in Salem.
33:23
I lived in Corvallis.
33:25
I didn’t even hear about it until reading about it with this
33:29
Lesbian Avengers of New York City.
33:31
They were like, this is an atrocity.
33:34
It wasn’t publicized.
33:36
No one was really like, don’t do—it just was either silenced
33:41
or people were like, what did you expect if you’re going to be out.
33:43
You know what I’m saying?
33:44
It also shows the intersectionality of people hating folks for
33:49
multiple identities, like multiple overlapping identities.
33:54
This invisibilizing I’d say white LGB people invisibilized our
33:59
brothers, sisters, and siblings who are people of color and very much
34:03
being like, oh we’ll be the leaders.
34:05
We’ll be the visible speakers, but this violence was happening to
34:10
everyone and it was happening even more if someone had another identity
34:13
on top of being queer or trans.
34:16
I don’t remember.
34:18
There was a Portland Lesbian Avenger chapter and I don’t know how they
34:21
started, but it started in New York City.
34:25
I think we all were like, wow!
34:27
This is a chance to fight back, to resist, to be visible.
34:30
There just wasn’t a lot of lesbian visibility back then.
34:34
I think the word spread.
34:35
Again, with no internet or social media, it spread like wildfire.
34:38
People were like, oh there’s this thing.
34:39
There’s this model.
34:40
It’s super dynamic.
34:41
It’s about visuals.
34:42
It’s about art.
34:43
It’s about beauty.
34:43
It’s about sex.
34:44
It’s about flirting.
34:46
It’s about being out and proud and defiant in the face of even
34:51
literally lethal violence, even when people are firebombing people to
34:55
death we’re still going to shine.
34:58
We’re still going to be loud.
34:59
We’re still going to take up space.
35:00
We’re still going to insist on our human rights and our ability
35:05
to build community together.
35:10
I know the Portland chapter of Lesbian Avengers started first.
35:14
My girlfriend at the time, Julie, we would go up to Portland a lot for
35:18
their actions and their meetings.
35:19
A lot of times meetings just turned into parties, because it was like, you
35:23
all probably know, one way to resist is to enjoy pleasure and beauty and fun,
35:28
even when horrible things are happening.
35:30
It’s like you can’t suck the soul out of us.
35:35
You can’t stop us from feeling joy and connection and beauty even when
35:40
these horrible things are happening.
35:43
We heard about the idea from them and we kept going up for their meetings.
35:46
At a certain point we were like we can just start this in Corvallis.
35:52
So, we did.
35:54
We might need to pause.
35:55
Okay, sure.
35:56
I’m going to go grab a drink.
35:57
Oh, that will work.
35:58
Do you want to say something before we?
36:02
[Shakes head no]
36:03
. Okay.
36:07
So,
36:10
you already touched on why the Avengers started in Corvallis.
36:16
What was it like to be one of the founding mothers, as you
36:21
put it, of the Avengers here?
36:25
That’s a good question.
36:29
One of the things I liked is that it crystallized, there was so
36:33
much stuff happening every day.
36:35
I think especially if you had any kind of a diverse friend group
36:39
people were experiencing so many awful things day to day to day.
36:44
I mean, we have the word microaggressions now, but some of
36:47
it was just flat out aggression.
36:50
People I knew who had any kind of, again anything other than, and even
36:54
my friends who were white males would still experience, especially one of
36:59
my friends who was gay, there was so much crap happening all the time.
37:05
Individuals could resist.
37:06
You might have your group of friends who you could talk to about it, but
37:09
being a Lesbian Avenger, it was a focal point for resistance, where
37:15
like-minded people came together and were like we are not taking this crap.
37:20
We are going to fight back.
37:21
We’re going to do it in an organized way.
37:23
We did activism on campus.
37:25
A lot of my friends and some of the other founding mothers of the Lesbian
37:28
Avengers—Carla Cohen and Jodie Limmer [phonetic] —through the Women’s Center
37:32
did activism around sexual violence and there were SafeRide’s back then, which was
37:40
a ride service where—I don’t know, do you still have that if someone felt unsafe?
37:44
Great, yeah.
37:45
Cool.
37:46
I don’t need to explain it.
37:49
People were fighting back in little ways and we would ally with, I was never
37:53
formally a part of the Women’s Center but I spent a lot of time there because
37:56
my friends were running it or involved.
37:59
We would ally with cultural centers and there was kind of this thing,
38:02
and we made tons of mistakes.
38:04
I’m not trying to pretend it was a utopia.
38:06
Working across difference is challenging, hard, beautiful work.
38:12
We definitely made mistakes, but I feel like we all were just
38:15
like, uh, we have to do this.
38:16
We have to fight back.
38:18
Lesbian Avengers was never a campus group.
38:21
It was Corvallis Lesbian Avengers, not OSU.
38:24
Because we knew OSU would never, was never going to fund or
38:28
support the stuff that we did.
38:32
It was a chance, we were a multi-issue from the beginning
38:35
and also very inclusive.
38:39
Once I became the LG—eventually I was the LGBTA advocate, so I’ll just say that.
38:44
We tapped into funding to bring speakers and host events and what not.
38:48
We brought Sarah Schulman to Corvallis.
38:51
She was the woman who started all the Lesbian Avengers.
38:56
There were, I don’t know, maybe a dozen or more chapters,
38:59
dozens maybe around the world.
39:00
It was like a phenomenon besides Corvallis.
39:04
I remember her, she was sitting on my couch on 2nd Street with her partner.
39:11
We were just talking.
39:12
She was like, oh what’s it like?
39:13
I was like, oh, one of the things I love about being an Avenger is we
39:15
address all kinds of issues, so not just ones that are lesbian specific,
39:20
but sexual violence, racism, lesbophobia
39:26
just all the stuff that was coming up.
39:28
It was a group of people who were like, let’s do this.
39:30
From the get-go from our literally like there are photographs in our albums from
39:36
the beginning we were inclusive of lesbian women, bi women, and also trans women.
39:43
I remember mentioning that, and Sarah Shulman is a brilliant academic and an
39:48
extraordinary person and probably has evolved her views by now, but at the
39:52
time she was like it’s just for lesbians.
39:55
It’s not, she didn’t say this, but kind of like you’re doing it wrong.
39:59
It’s not supposed to be for all those people.
40:03
We were kind of like, A] really?
40:07
B] really?
40:08
And C] we don’t live in New York City.
40:12
We have to hang together.
40:14
We have to support each other.
40:17
We can’t split our community that way.
40:20
I remember being really disappointed.
40:21
I think she was pretty disappointed with us, too, to be honest.
40:24
I think she was kind of like, you’re doing it wrong.
40:26
We were like, this is the rightest thing we’ve ever done.
40:29
It felt so, like I can remember—so in addition allying with campus groups
40:36
around racist incidents and looking at incredible amounts of sexual violence,
40:43
pushing back to fight against that, there was a woman who was one of our
40:47
avengers and she was corresponding with someone who was in prison or jail and
40:54
was writing letters back and forth and was sending them through [I don’t know
40:57
if they’re still there] but it was the Corvallis mail center, or something.
41:04
Not the Post Office.
41:06
One of the employees read her as a trans woman and opened her mail and wrote to
41:12
that person and outed her and was like, I think called her a faggot and was like
41:20
whatever horrible, offensive language.
41:23
That’s a federal offense.
41:24
You cannot open someone’s mail and read it and then write to
41:27
the person they’re writing to.
41:30
There’s nothing okay or legal about that, but the police were kind of
41:36
like, well, we don’t know it was her, even though she had handwritten it.
41:40
It was her.
41:41
It was the employee.
41:42
It was for sure the employee who did it.
41:44
I don’t think she was unwise enough to sign her name, but it was—anyone who
41:49
had wanted to investigate could have easily figured out what happened and how.
41:55
But, whoever was in charge was like [shrugs] whatever.
41:57
It’s not really a priority.
41:58
We don’t care.
41:59
Whatever, whatever.
42:00
We protested outside of the mail center and were trying to hold them accountable
42:06
and saying something has to got to happen.
42:08
I’m not a big fan of punitive measures.
42:10
I don’t think imprisoning or jailing people is going to solve any of
42:14
these problems, and at some point there has to be some—someone has to
42:18
got to say, you can’t freaking open someone’s mail, out someone, write hate
42:23
speech to their—none of that is okay.
42:26
Ultimately, I don’t think there were ever any, there was never any consequences
42:30
or accountability but we were like we’re going to stand, she’s an avenger.
42:34
We’re going to stand with her, of course.
42:36
Examples like that—I’m like, how do you split that.
42:39
How do you say, well, that’s not a lesbian issue but this is.
42:44
I don’t know.
42:44
To me that just never made sense.
42:47
We were all, there wasn’t very much group think around Lesbian Avengers,
42:51
but that was one thing that everybody was committed to, like full inclusivity.
42:55
Bi women, too.
42:56
A lot of bi women were discriminated against and invisibilized and we were
43:00
just like, of course you’re welcome.
43:03
There’s a lot of dynamics around the gender of someone’s partner, but
43:07
pretty much if someone she was a dyke.
43:09
Then, we were like great.
43:10
You’re a dyke.
43:11
Also, as a loving, inclusive term, and also I wasn’t out to myself
43:18
as trans, but I was definitely a super, super masculine woman.
43:24
Possibly because I helped start the group, but people were super accepting of me.
43:28
No one was like [makes reject sound] . I mean, later my queer woman friends
43:32
had trouble with my transitioning, but at the time it was like, yeah
43:37
we’re all here for each other.
43:40
That was just hugely healing.
43:42
Because a lot of us back then it was pretty normal for people’s
43:45
families to reject them.
43:47
So, we had to make our own families.
43:50
We had to find love and connection and security and fun and even celebrating
43:57
holidays together or relaxing.
43:59
You had to create that for yourself.
44:02
Very few people had that with their family
44:10
of origin.
44:12
You did mention that outside of the fact that Lesbian Avengers
44:18
you were very all-inclusive.
44:20
I think you mentioned that there was not a whole of very solid group ideology.
44:26
I kind of wanted to ask, what was the structure of the Avengers like in general?
44:33
Yeah, good question.
44:35
The New York Avengers put out a handbook, but back in the day honestly a lot
44:40
of it was really incredible graphics and visuals because we photocopied.
44:44
That’s what you did.
44:45
There was no digital.
44:46
I don’t know, Word probably was around.
44:49
I don’t even know if that’s true.
44:51
If you were going to make visuals, you photocopied them.
44:54
You needed a physical copy.
44:56
There was a Lesbian Avenger Manifesto.
44:59
They chose a comic bomb logo in response to the fire-bombing.
45:05
It was this really poignant and atrocious—the origin of it.
45:10
I love the idea of reclaiming things and just saying,
45:13
you’re going to do this to us?
45:14
Okay, fine we’re going to take it.
45:15
Some of the slogans were: we take the fire within us.
45:19
We take it and make it our own.
45:20
We learned how to eat fire and also blow fire.
45:22
We literally knew how to take fire and that was one of the
45:26
things that we did at our demos.
45:27
Be the bomb you throw was another.
45:30
The idea, Julie and I were just talking about this in the car on
45:33
the way over, back then just being out and visible was activism.
45:38
It may seem like the weakest sauce now, but back then just being out, just
45:44
walking down the street I was disrupting people’s narratives about what a
45:48
woman should be, what a man should be.
45:51
Just being out and visible was being activist.
45:53
This idea that we embodied the power to destabilize the patriarchy and
45:59
white dominance and colonialism just by our very being was pretty wonderful
46:04
and also really scary at times.
46:07
I’m trying to think what else.
46:09
We had the manifesto.
46:10
We had the handbook.
46:12
We photocopied a lot of stuff out of it.
46:14
I also really loved that Lesbian Avengers from the very beginning they used humor as
46:19
one of the weapons, because in some ways it was so hard to be out as a dyke at the
46:24
time, and also it was really beautiful in the way that you build community under
46:29
duress when it seems like there’s so much hostility you can really come together.
46:35
We had these funny top ten lists of who should be an
46:38
avenger to use a lot of humor.
46:40
Back then I don’t know if this still happens but people would be like,
46:43
feminists just have no sense of humor.
46:45
We just would be like, we’re cracking up all the time.
46:48
Granted, we’re laughing at you, the patriarchy, colonialism, white supremacy,
46:53
but we’re laughing all the time.
46:56
It just was a weird mixed message.
47:02
New York City was very hands off.
47:04
No one was trying to start, there was no canvassing or whatever, it
47:07
was more like here’s this thing.
47:09
Use what’s useful.
47:11
Go for it.
47:14
We wanted a low hierarchy group.
47:15
We wanted a rotating leadership.
47:17
I wish we had our notes, because our meetings were hilarious.
47:20
We’d usually meet in someone’s home, sometimes a coffee shop.
47:23
There was a lesbian owned coffee shop that we would meet at sometimes.
47:27
But it was this really cool and also really weird patching together
47:32
because there was no Pride Center, there was no community center.
47:38
There’s pros and cons to that, but there was no “officially sanctioned
47:42
space,” so we were constantly like we sometimes joked and called ourselves
47:47
the Lesbian Scavengers, because we would always be like, oh this thing
47:50
over here, this thing over here.
47:53
I think from New York City they said I think the number one quality of a Lesbian
47:57
Avenger was access to free photocopying.
48:00
You made flyers.
48:01
You made posters.
48:02
You just made everything.
48:04
There was no digital.
48:05
I can remember going in and printing, we printed a ton of stickers and
48:10
they show up in our scrapbooks.
48:12
All kinds of things.
48:14
I remember going into a print shop.
48:15
I don’t know if it’s still there.
48:16
I didn’t check on my way into town.
48:18
It was just owned by some guy, but it was the nearest one to my house.
48:23
I remember going in and wanting to print say a 3” x 4” sheet of 12 stickers.
48:30
I think it just said Lesbian Avengers.
48:32
We had gotten a landline [because that’s what you did back then] and voicemail,
48:37
so we just put our phone number on things and then put the stickers up.
48:39
So, it’d say Lesbian Avengers and have the bomb logo and then our phone number.
48:43
We put those everywhere.
48:45
I was trying to print more and you know I read him as heterosexual; I read him
48:50
as white; I read him as cis gender.
48:53
It was so clear that he was really uncomfortable, and so I
48:57
was like oh, will you help me.
48:59
I’m trying to reformat this.
49:00
Can you make it a little bigger.
49:02
I just was like trolling him because he was being so phobic and finally he slammed
49:08
his hand down on the copier and was like, I will not photocopy anymore lesbian, I
49:12
think he called it trash or something.
49:14
I was like, okay, girl.
49:16
Calm yourself down.
49:18
He just was like, no I won’t do it.
49:20
And you know, that’s illegal.
49:23
You can’t not serve someone because they’re gay, but I will admit to being
49:28
a little antagonistic, but whatever.
49:34
At a certain point there was a queer woman or a lesbian woman who owned a copy place.
49:40
She would let us do our posters and we would pay here sometimes,
49:43
or sometimes she would donate it.
49:45
It was like you patched everything together where you could.
49:49
I felt that way about our leadership, too.
49:51
Everyone who came in—I think our first meeting had maybe nine or ten people,
49:56
and these were people that I really respected and admired as activists.
50:00
Really strong, powerful women who had been through a lot and had brought their
50:04
life experiences to their leadership.
50:08
I remember we were just like, can we do this thing?
50:09
And we’re like, yeah we can.
50:11
I think at our maximum we probably had 25 members,
50:19
20, 25 somewhere in there.
50:21
It was important to us to build leadership, so not have the
50:24
same people always be in charge.
50:26
There was a core, I would say Julie, myself, Carla, Jodie, Ang, and Heidi
50:33
[phonetic] . There was a core of eight to ten people who would do
50:37
a lot of, make a lot of decisions.
50:39
I’m not going to try and pretend it was purely egalitarian.
50:42
We didn’t want to have a president or anything like that.
50:47
The notes, I wish we had copies of the notes, because just depending
50:51
on who was the notetaker they were just always hilarious.
50:54
Because we were always talking about so much random stuff.
51:01
What sort of like activities, parties, protests did the
51:05
Avengers plan, participate in?
51:08
That’s a good question.
51:10
We were partially reactive, so whatever horrible thing had happened,
51:13
mostly on campus but sometimes in the community, we would respond to that.
51:18
Again, sexual assaults, racist violence, overt homophobia in classes.
51:25
Again, transphobia wasn’t happening much mainly because there were no out,
51:29
visible trans people that I was aware of.
51:33
We did some fundraising and this tapped into a really interesting question.
51:39
Corvallis had a very strong lesbian and bi women’s community, gay women’s
51:44
community but it was very underground.
51:46
If you knew people, then you were part of the community but if you
51:50
didn’t people very much blended in.
51:53
I’d say really white dominant.
51:55
I would say mostly lesbian women.
51:58
I don’t think bi women were very well accepted in the larger community.
52:02
There was this apartment complex called The Carolines
52:05
which was owned by a lesbian.
52:08
It was all lesbian and bi women and it was like, I never lived
52:12
there but I dated people who did.
52:13
It was so much drama.
52:14
It was
52:18
90210 if it were all lesbians.
52:20
People would be dating and breaking up and whatever, but it was kind
52:22
of cool, a lesbian owned building.
52:24
It was safe housing for queer women.
52:27
I don’t know.
52:28
That was revolutionary and then also comic in some ways.
52:35
When the Lesbian Avengers burst onto the scene, older generations of
52:40
lesbians had really mixed feelings.
52:42
Some were like, you go girl.
52:44
Great, fantastic, get it, we needed something like this for a
52:47
long time, but lots of people were like, you’re rocking the boat.
52:51
You’re destabilizing.
52:53
We’ve got a good thing going here.
52:55
Don’t mess it up.
52:57
If you’re out and visible and vocal and you’re starting shit or whatever, then
53:02
you’re messing it up for all of us.
53:04
At the time, I felt pretty impatient with those arguments.
53:07
It
53:09
was a time when every out person would have made such a big difference.
53:13
So many of these women were closeted, and I have empathy and I
53:17
understand more now as I get older.
53:19
I think at the time I was like don’t ask us to slow down to make you
53:24
more comfortable in your privilege.
53:26
Do you know what I’m saying?
53:28
We have to be who we are.
53:29
Nothing’s going to change if we stay silent.
53:33
Being out is such a—and especially at that time, being out was such a, just a
53:38
really important part of being active, because the whole thing is people just
53:41
didn’t think they knew gay people.
53:43
They didn’t know that their auntie, or their coworker, or their neighbor,
53:47
or their son or whoever was, because people were so closeted.
53:51
It felt “okay” to hate people if you never thought you knew them.
53:55
It really caused this intergenerational conflict, and I
53:59
think among queer women themselves.
54:02
I remember some of our really strong supporters.
54:04
There was a couple named Gwen and Caroline [phonetic] who were so meaningful,
54:07
especially to Julie and I. I feel like they took us under our wing and were
54:12
our mothers when our mothers couldn’t be there for us, gave us good advice, let us
54:16
know what was going on, helped fund us.
54:22
The Lesbian Avengers kind of had a superhero theme.
54:26
For every avenger who wanted them, Gwen is an amazing seamstress so
54:32
she sowed capes for all of us, these pink satiny or frilly—I think
54:37
mine was sporty mesh material.
54:42
Everyone got their personalized capes sown and that’s just
54:45
such an incredible act of love.
54:47
It meant so much for us to have our elders, as few as there were, seemingly,
54:53
they were so loving and supportive.
54:55
Then I remember we had done an action against sexual violence and the women who
55:01
ran—it was called CARDV, so Center Against Rape and Domestic Violence, they may still
55:06
be around, they wrote us a card and were like we really appreciate you doing this.
55:11
That meant so much.
55:13
A lot of older lesbians were just like you all are causing problems for us.
55:18
We were kind of like, you all cause problems for us for not opening the road.
55:24
We now have to shoulder this burden.
55:35
What were major events that influenced the path the Avengers
55:41
took, particularly the Corvallis one.
55:44
I know you touched on the fire-bombing.
55:49
How did the HIV/AIDS Crisis or Measures IX and XIII influence you guys?
55:54
I think those things
55:59
were really relevant for context and they informed what we did.
56:02
They gave us a sense of urgency.
56:04
For example, the HIV/AIDS called to mind safer sex and a lot of that was more
56:10
essential for men who were having sex with men and what now I would call trans
56:17
women, which no one was talking about at the time in terms of being protected
56:21
or recognizing people’s struggles.
56:24
It made us educate ourselves around safer sex, even for women, for women context.
56:30
Using dental dams or lube or gloves, things like that.
56:34
The Oregon Citizens Alliance, I feel like that was all hands on deck.
56:38
People felt like such a threat.
56:41
If you can imagine if the Oregon constitution said homosexuality and
56:45
bisexuality are unnatural and perverse and government can’t support them,
56:49
that’s—and especially we knew if it won in Oregon it would spread to other states.
56:55
If it “worked here,” then it would go across the nation.
56:59
That felt really urgent.
57:02
I like the Lesbian Avengers, because it was the official arm and, to be
57:06
honest, it was very conservative.
57:09
It was very much like if we don’t rock the boat and we “look normal”
57:14
and we look assimilationist and the message was kind of like,
57:17
we’re just like you. Don’t hurt us.
57:18
We’re just like you.
57:19
I think Avengers were like, we’re not just like you and that’s good.
57:23
We are trying to destabilize these harmful patterns of patriarchy, heteronormativity,
57:28
white dominance, colonialism.
57:31
We weren’t like, oh yeah if we just fit in everything’s going to be fine.
57:36
I could go on campus and organize a—well one great example of this that
57:42
I love is as Avengers we could just kind of like start trouble if you
57:49
will and start conversations and be very visible in ways that we couldn’t
57:54
on campus or through the campaigns.
57:57
I think in Corvallis the first spokesperson they chose was a
58:00
straight person, which is fine.
58:04
Straight, white woman, I believe.
58:06
But it was kind of like, really?
58:08
You won’t even—like we’re so awful, we’re so untouchable that we can’t
58:12
even speak on our own behalf, so it was like, well, we don’t want to
58:16
choose someone that people—anyway, I don’t know what they were thinking.
58:20
I would still go and phone bank and distribute bumper stickers or pens,
58:24
I would still participate in the mainstream campaign, but it felt
58:28
really good to then go like scream and organize our rally on the streets on
58:34
campus or in front of the courthouse.
58:36
I can remember one of the things we did at our first meeting there
58:39
was a woman, her name’s Boky.
58:42
She’s out.
58:43
At the time, she was on the women’s basketball team.
58:46
She was being told by her coach not to be out as a lesbian.
58:49
They were like you got to hide who you are.
58:52
There were other queer women, but it was so closeted.
58:55
She was literally told, don’t come out.
58:57
She came to us and was like, hey what can I do about this?
59:01
We organized
59:05
the team.
59:06
It was very popular with lesbian and bi women.
59:09
There was a whole, there’s two sides of the court.
59:12
There was a whole side of the court that was all lesbian and bi women.
59:15
People would have season tickets and it was like hundreds of women and
59:18
then everyone else elsewhere, right?
59:23
They would have these things called, take a girl to the game night.
59:26
The “idea” was bring your daughter to “expose her” to being
59:30
a woman athlete, or something.
59:32
I don’t know.
59:34
We were like, oh, take a girl to the game night.
59:36
What a great idea.
59:38
One of our first visible actions was we made this huge banner and
59:41
it was like, Lesbian Avengers take your girl to the game night.
59:44
It had our phone number.
59:45
It was like, we recruit, right?
59:46
We were trying to get visible.
59:49
It started a shit storm.
59:51
The coach was so mad.
59:53
Campus was freaking out.
59:55
Again, lesbian women in the community had this huge debate
59:59
about was this doing good?
1:00:01
Was it causing harm, whatever.
1:00:03
Then I remember going to that action on say a Friday night or something and
1:00:07
then on Monday going back to my job and just being [blithe whistling] . It felt
1:00:11
like being a double agent in some ways, because we were doing these outrageous
1:00:15
visual, causing a lot of uproar and ruckus in what I would consider a
1:00:19
positive way and then going right back in.
1:00:22
It was like I got to work in the system in a fairly conservative way
1:00:27
and then also outside the system in a not conservative at all way.
1:00:32
To me, the culmination of all that was I think a few years later the
1:00:36
Athletics Department was, okay, fine.
1:00:38
We have a problem with homophobia.
1:00:40
We want a panel of students to come in, student leaders to come in and talk to us.
1:00:45
I got to be one of the student leaders.
1:00:47
It was that satisfying thing of we started this conversation and now we’re back
1:00:52
here to be the “benign official face” of
1:00:58
the “likeable queers” that people could relate to.
1:01:01
Having both of those, that dual role, was pretty satisfying.
1:01:08
I remember one of my other favorite actions that we did—so, I lived on 2nd
1:01:13
street in a house right as you come into town you can see it on your right.
1:01:17
It’s like right as you come into town.
1:01:20
During the campaign, we had an 8’ pink triangle that said “No on Nine” in
1:01:28
huge letters on our lawn. Our landlord tried to get us to take it down. We
1:01:33
were like, no we’re not taking it down.
1:01:34
It became this legal issue.
1:01:38
It made our house be a target and we got calls with death threats,
1:01:45
which is really freaky when you think about it, because it means—and,
1:01:48
again, there was no internet, right?
1:01:49
It means someone who knew my phone number gave my phone number to someone
1:01:53
I didn’t know and then took the time to call and leave like, we’re going to
1:01:58
kill you, you fucking queers message on our answering machine at home.
1:02:03
I think all queer people lived there.
1:02:04
It was really scary, just that kind of scrutiny.
1:02:11
I think you all had seen the pictures of somebody spray painted swastikas and
1:02:17
white dominant and white supremacism and Nazi stuff on the shed in our backyard.
1:02:25
I remember one time I was out mowing the lawn and it was a really
1:02:29
hot day so I took my shirt off.
1:02:31
I was topless and I had breasts at the time, and someone called the police.
1:02:36
Somebody driving by called the police.
1:02:38
I had finished.
1:02:39
I was in drinking a glass of water.
1:02:41
These two officers knocked on my door.
1:02:43
I was the only one home.
1:02:45
They were like, so was someone mowing the lawn earlier.
1:02:47
I was like, yeah that was me.
1:02:49
They were like, did you take your shirt off?
1:02:51
I was like, yes I did.
1:02:52
They were like, um... just so you know, it’s illegal.
1:02:56
I was like, just so you know that’s sexist.
1:02:58
Why would it be okay for a man to have his shirt off and a woman can’t.
1:03:02
They were like, well, it’s state statute.
1:03:04
We can’t do anything about it.
1:03:05
We’re not going to give you a ticket, but just don’t do it again.
1:03:08
We were like, bullshit.
1:03:10
We organized an action called, roller booby, where, and I
1:03:14
got to drive the getaway van.
1:03:16
I drove the van and dropped off Lesbian Avengers.
1:03:20
This is one of those things of like, it’s not a “lesbian issue” but it totally is.
1:03:26
We dropped off I think half a dozen Lesbian Avengers who were on roller
1:03:29
skates; they took off their shirts.
1:03:31
They roller skated madly around downtown and then we had like,
1:03:35
I drove for the pickup spot.
1:03:36
They skated off and got in the van and we drove away.
1:03:40
It was one of the things of like, if you mess with us we’re
1:03:43
going to mess with you back.
1:03:44
If you have sexist rules about whose bodies are okay to see, then
1:03:50
we’re going to push back on those rules and we’re going to fight back.
1:03:54
That satisfying, when something happened, we had a group of
1:03:57
people who we trusted to respond.
1:04:01
How common was it to experience stuff like, because you mentioned
1:04:07
there was the swastika on you know, graffiti that... I wanted to ask
1:04:09
how common was that kind of stuff
1:04:23
then?
1:04:25
How was it received by other people in the community?
1:04:29
That’s a good question.
1:04:31
The spray painting, that was the only time we experienced it.
1:04:35
I wouldn’t say it was common.
1:04:37
But, anti-queer and anti-trans violence happened all the time.
1:04:41
I think most of the times we met once a week and someone had
1:04:44
experienced a significant—someone in the group had experienced a
1:04:47
significant form of violence.
1:04:51
I want to say verbal harassment.
1:04:52
It wasn’t always physical violence.
1:04:54
A lot of that is what we responded to.
1:04:56
If a fraternity called one of us a dyke, then we would show up on their doorstep
1:05:01
and be like you can’t call us dykes.
1:05:04
Push back in some way.
1:05:06
It happened all the time, and no hyperbole, for sure when I left the
1:05:12
house people would say something, even if it wasn’t always overtly hostile.
1:05:18
We were constantly getting scrutinized and commented on in terms of our
1:05:21
appearance, if nothing else sexist standards around femininity.
1:05:25
A lot of times it was overtly anti-gay or anti-queer.
1:05:28
I do remember being kindly affirmed in my gender in this really weird way
1:05:33
walking on 2nd Street in Corvallis and a car full of, I don’t know that it was
1:05:39
always guys, but I’m just going to go ahead and say guys being like, fucking
1:05:43
dyke and being like, oh God, again.
1:05:46
Then, two blocks later people driving by and being like, fucking faggot,
1:05:51
and being like, okay at least I’m being affirmed in my gender queerness.
1:05:56
If you’re going to harass me at least it’s not just one thing.
1:06:00
I don’t know.
1:06:00
That’s not a good thing, but it was stuff like that would happen all the time.
1:06:05
It was very common.
1:06:06
One of the interesting things, and, again I feel mixed about punishing,
1:06:10
especially legal punishments, that’s a really complicated conversation.
1:06:16
There was no process of accountability.
1:06:18
Not campus.
1:06:20
Not our families.
1:06:21
Not our neighbors.
1:06:23
Not faith communities.
1:06:24
Not the police or whatever that’s going to do.
1:06:28
There was no institution that was like, this is not okay and we’re going to
1:06:33
ask for accountability to make it stop.
1:06:35
That’s why the Lesbian Avengers felt so power at that point in my life,
1:06:39
because we were the only organization that had—even on campus a lot of the
1:06:45
“diversity” initiatives were very watered down and were kind of like, well,
1:06:49
we’ll do stuff as long as it doesn’t destabilize the way we do business, right?
1:06:53
They were worried about, I remember, so do they still have Mom’s Weekend?
1:06:58
Do you all know?
1:06:59
Okay.
1:06:59
They’d have Mom’s Weekend and we’d be like oh, we want to host an event for either
1:07:04
queer moms or parents of queers on campus.
1:07:07
They were like, absolutely not.
1:07:09
We were like, so we made this poster that said, we have moms too.
1:07:14
It’s a picture of
1:07:17
someone I read as a person of color who had made up their face half
1:07:21
“masculine,” or male, and half “feminine.” The university felt no problem in
1:07:27
being like you can’t be visible.
1:07:28
You can’t do this.
1:07:30
So, the next year we were like, f* this.
1:07:33
We made sure that Pride Weekend fell on Mom’s Weekend, because we were
1:07:36
like you cannot tell us that we don’t have moms or none of our moms are gay.
1:07:41
You cannot do that.
1:07:42
We made sure that it overlapped.
1:07:44
It caused a lot of problems.
1:07:45
They got a ton of complaints.
1:07:47
And we were like, okay, deal with it.
1:07:49
Tell these moms they have LGBTQ kids or some of them LGBTQ and that’s how it is.
1:07:56
They can’t discriminate against us.
1:08:06
How did being in the Avengers influence your coming to terms with your identity,
1:08:14
maybe how did it help or not help you come out to yourself in other ways?
1:08:21
That’s a good question.
1:08:27
I have probably known about 100 trans people, mostly trans guys or
1:08:32
trans masculine people in my life.
1:08:34
I think my experience is very unique in that I was proud to be a girl and a woman.
1:08:40
I was proud to be a strong girl and a woman.
1:08:43
I strongly identified as a woman and that hasn’t shifted.
1:08:46
During that period of time, I was an out and proud, I would say dyke, lesbian,
1:08:51
Lesbian Avenger, for seven or eight years.
1:08:56
A good chunk of time.
1:08:58
That part of my life is really important to me.
1:09:00
I value it.
1:09:01
I learned so much.
1:09:02
I felt with this group of people and pretty much only with this
1:09:07
group of people, I felt valued.
1:09:09
I felt at home.
1:09:09
I felt seen.
1:09:10
I felt how we were able to do that for each other.
1:09:16
Even if Lesbian Avengers had gone on for 20 more years, I still would have
1:09:19
transitioned at some point, but when I started to lose that community,
1:09:23
and the group eventually disbanded.
1:09:26
People can correct me if I’m wrong, other Avengers, I don’t remember there
1:09:30
being a big fight or anything like that.
1:09:32
It was more people graduated or moved away.
1:09:34
The time kind of shifted.
1:09:35
It wasn’t as violent of a time, even in those five or six years we were around.
1:09:40
Things shifted enough.
1:09:42
I moved to Portland and started a group called Gender Machine Works,
1:09:45
which was kind of like Lesbian Avengers but for trans guys.
1:09:52
It’s my memory that things just naturally disbanded.
1:09:55
We didn’t have a fight or a split.
1:09:59
That time really allowed me to feel proud and strong as a queer
1:10:05
woman and it was clear I was like, oh we can do something about this.
1:10:09
We can resist.
1:10:10
We can rebel.
1:10:11
It can be joyful.
1:10:12
It can be beautiful.
1:10:13
It can have art and visuals and sexiness and connection.
1:10:17
It also really brought home to me how important intersection—what
1:10:19
we could call intersectionality.
1:10:21
That we have got to work together, or we’re not going to make it.
1:10:26
I would say, well, my relationship with Julie.
1:10:30
That’s a whole other hour-long conversation, but she’s a lifelong friend.
1:10:34
We dated for five years and we split up right as I was starting to learn
1:10:39
about trans people and I was like, oh maybe I’m one of these folks.
1:10:43
She was kind of like, that classic I don’t know—that transitioning, for any of you
1:10:50
who have done it, takes a lot of energy.
1:10:53
It can destabilize relationships anyway.
1:10:55
It’s hard to maintain those.
1:10:57
Just as we were breaking up, mostly amicably.
1:11:00
There were some fights, for sure, but she’s been my dear friend for
1:11:06
decades and her son, Arthur, is one of the loves of my life, a
1:11:11
really important person in my life.
1:11:16
As things were breaking is right when I started, well, just
1:11:18
seeing images of trans people.
1:11:21
Any kind of recognition that we existed.
1:11:24
I started thinking, oh maybe there’s something else besides being a butch dyke.
1:11:29
There’s some other layer to this that I’m not thinking about.
1:11:36
When I started transitioning I do feel like that changed my
1:11:39
relationships and my friendships.
1:11:41
Back then, I think queer women were kind of like, okay we respect your
1:11:45
choice but you’re not one of us anymore.
1:11:48
It was this painful,
1:11:51
again, some of it was just us naturally graduating or drifting
1:11:54
apart, but some of it was
1:11:57
okay, well, if you’re going to do that then you’re not one of us
1:12:01
anymore, which was really complicated.
1:12:06
I understand in some ways.
1:12:07
I saw this happen, too, with my friends who maybe had been lesbians for years and
1:12:13
then started dating a cis male partner.
1:12:16
Some of it was biphobia.
1:12:18
Some of it was harm, but some of it was like we just don’t have much in common.
1:12:24
When I started transition, I did decide to go on testosterone, as might be apparent
1:12:31
by the way I look.
1:12:33
Testosterone, when I started taking it, it shifted my attractions.
1:12:36
I had never kissed a boy, ever.
1:12:38
When I started taking testosterone, I started being attracted to guys.
1:12:42
I was like, no offense straight people but I was like, okay well,
1:12:45
I’m not going to be straight.
1:12:47
I was like, how the hell am I going to go from being this out, flamboyant,
1:12:51
proud, queer woman to a straight guy.
1:12:53
I was like, okay I’m going to get to stay queer.
1:12:56
I’m going to be a queer guy.
1:12:57
I just didn’t know anything about dating men or sex with men or whatever.
1:13:03
That was a challenge.
1:13:05
That took, again, a lot of energy.
1:13:07
All of a sudden, I had to think about HIV and STIs in a different way.
1:13:11
As a woman, yes, of course, women can get STIs from women partners, female partners,
1:13:17
of any gender, but being thrown into the mix of having sexual relationships
1:13:22
with gay and bisexual men, I was like okay now I really need to think about
1:13:26
this in terms of condoms and what not.
1:13:30
I moved back to Portland.
1:13:32
Julie had moved back I think a year before.
1:13:37
Like I said, I started Gender Machine Works.
1:13:39
I’ve been involved in activism since then, so that didn’t go away.
1:13:43
I will say that time of my life, I treasure it.
1:13:47
It was so magical.
1:13:49
It was so hard and so dangerous and so beautiful and I don’t know.
1:13:55
In talking to other people, I don’t think very many people have had an
1:13:58
experience like that, where they have this
1:14:03
oasis of resistance, like a place where they can truly be themselves and
1:14:06
resist and push back and fight back.
1:14:08
I feel incredibly lucky to
1:14:17
have had that.
1:14:17
Do you want to pause so you can get another water?
1:14:19
Okay.
1:14:20
How are you all doing on time?
1:14:22
We’ve gone about an hour and a half.
1:14:25
A little less.
1:14:26
Maybe an hour fifteen.
1:14:27
I think if, I mean how are you doing on time?
1:14:29
I’m fine.
1:14:30
You good?
1:14:30
Yeah.
1:14:31
I’m loving these questions,
1:14:36
Alice.
1:14:36
Thank you.
1:14:36
Because you’ve now answered a lot of our questions and a lot
1:14:37
of events that we brought ahead.
1:14:40
I think if we have about five minutes to just re-tidy so it will be easier for
1:14:44
us to ask all of the questions.
1:14:44
Cool.
1:14:44
Yeah, I’ll get
1:14:47
water and let you all do your thing and just figure out what you want to do
1:14:54
next.
1:14:54
What was a normal day at OSU like as a member of the Lesbian Avengers?
1:15:00
How did maybe
1:15:03
your membership infect, not infect, but affect your
1:15:08
relationships with people here?
1:15:10
Good question.
1:15:12
My normal day was probably a lot like yours.
1:15:15
Wake up, usually as late as I possibly could, usually having stayed up too
1:15:19
late procrastinating on a paper or project or reading or having sex,
1:15:24
because there was lots of that.
1:15:27
Then going to campus, focusing on my classes, usually dealing with,
1:15:32
again, scrutiny and harassment if somebody looked visibly LGB.
1:15:39
Being an Avenger it was good to know I had people to go home to.
1:15:43
Again, like a role that my family of origin that should have been playing.
1:15:47
People who I could talk to, brainstorm, problem solve, people
1:15:51
who would protect each other.
1:15:53
It was also good, it was almost like this secret network, because you’d be
1:15:56
walking on campus and you’d see someone and be like [raised eyebrows and clicking
1:16:00
sound] , we know about each other.
1:16:02
Other people may or may not.
1:16:06
I think of that more as an activist thing than an LGBTQ thing.
1:16:09
I think a lot of people who were out back then were just de facto activists.
1:16:13
If you weren’t an activist, you didn’t come out.
1:16:17
You just had to do so much work to be safe, to build a world
1:16:21
that was even semi-accepting.
1:16:25
Probably most of it was about the same as your lives.
1:16:28
Different political context and I did feel good knowing that I had something
1:16:37
to go home to, people who knew me and supported me and accepted my whole self.
1:16:43
That was pretty important.
1:16:46
Before we start to switch gears a little bit, just going back to some of the
1:16:51
activist movements that you were talking about that you guys did, you mentioned
1:16:53
that you worked with high schoolers.
1:16:55
I’m just wondering if you could expand a little bit on that.
1:16:58
Yeah, I think one of the most satisfying things, my experience of dominant US,
1:17:05
especially white dominant culture, is that it’s ahistorical and single generation.
1:17:10
Most of us aren’t lucky to have intergenerational relationships, I
1:17:14
think especially in white communities.
1:17:16
With queers, I think that was true to some extent, too.
1:17:20
I didn’t meet an older gay person that I knew of, I think my women’s
1:17:26
studies professor sophomore year—one woman was out as bi.
1:17:31
One woman was out as lesbian.
1:17:33
It wasn’t until I was a young adult that I met anyone that was part
1:17:37
of my kin or part of my people.
1:17:40
Again, we got a mixed reception from lesbian and bi women, our
1:17:44
elders here in the community.
1:17:46
One of the things that was really important to us is that young people
1:17:48
could see us, hear us, and identify us, find us when they need us.
1:17:54
That happened a number of times.
1:17:57
There was a young man named Paul who was at, I wanna say Corvallis High School.
1:18:02
Are there two
1:18:04
CVHS?
1:18:05
Anyone here know?
1:18:06
No?
1:18:08
I think there were two high schools.
1:18:09
He was at Corvallis High School and he was trying to start a gay-straight alliance.
1:18:15
Now, where I work, those are in elementary and middle schools.
1:18:19
It’s not a big deal.
1:18:19
Back then it was very controversial, according to the principal.
1:18:23
He was very determined and he and I knew each other, I can’t remember how we met.
1:18:29
Because Avengers were so visible, young people would come to us.
1:18:33
We would hang out or talk or give people advice or listen.
1:18:38
I remember he was walking home, Paul was walking home, and one
1:18:41
of his classmates punched him in the face, knocked his tooth out.
1:18:46
He bled all over the sidewalk.
1:18:48
He knew who it was.
1:18:49
That person didn’t deny it.
1:18:51
Again, police, cultural solutions are not going to get us where we
1:18:54
want to go, but the police were kind of like, what did you expect?
1:18:57
Again, this repeated—and even the school was like, well, you probably provoked it
1:19:04
because you’re a gay man by looking at him, or whatever BS that was happening.
1:19:10
We demonstrated at that high school.
1:19:13
Then there were a few students that were out at the other high
1:19:15
school and they asked us to come.
1:19:19
These were support rallies, but the leadership at that school, and I can’t
1:19:24
remember... somebody knows, the “other” high school, whatever name it was.
1:19:29
I want to say Christen Valley or something like that.
1:19:32
They put the building on lockdown and they said it was a riot.
1:19:35
They called the police.
1:19:37
This was literally us—there’s pictures in the album—we’re literally like,
1:19:40
honk if you support gay students.
1:19:42
Rainbows.
1:19:43
Friendly—this was not a riot.
1:19:46
I’m fine with a riot.
1:19:47
There’s a time and place for a riot, but this was not a riot, but it was
1:19:50
characterized as this massive threat to like the building and whatever.
1:19:54
We were like, students invited us here.
1:19:56
You do have LGBTQ students for sure at your school.
1:20:00
There are probably LGBTQ staff.
1:20:02
This is not some outsider threat.
1:20:06
People kind of lost their, went bananas about it.
1:20:10
It was really important for us to be visible and to be—and these
1:20:13
were students of all genders and,
1:20:19
okay, I’m on SCRUFF, judge me if you have to.
1:20:21
It’s an app for gay, bi, queer men to find other gay, bi, queer men to date, or
1:20:26
what have you, and just a few weeks ago one of the young people from, Julie and I
1:20:32
also did a support group in the basement in one of the churches on Monroe, and
1:20:37
so we met dozens of young people there.
1:20:39
This was one of the first support groups for LGBTQ youth.
1:20:43
We were both on SCRUFF and he was in Portland and he messaged me
1:20:45
and was like, hey I don’t know if you know, but you being out and
1:20:50
visible made such a difference.
1:20:51
He
1:20:53
has two moms and so one of the things he said, and this was really interesting
1:20:57
to me because I would have been maybe barely out as trans at that point.
1:21:03
He was like, the way you model being a man, being kind, being gentle,
1:21:09
he said stylish, he said James Dean [it was very flattering], but
1:21:12
I don’t know it’s been 30 years.
1:21:14
It’s been a long time and he still wanted to reach out and say what
1:21:19
a difference that it made to have visible out people who were affirming
1:21:23
and nurturing and supporting him and trying to give young people a way.
1:21:28
It’s a cliché, but what we all wish we had had, adults who are like, I see you.
1:21:32
I’m here for you.
1:21:34
You’re good.
1:21:35
You’re good at how you are teaching people how to resist
1:21:39
and fight back and be active.
1:21:41
It
1:21:43
was one of the most satisfying parts of
1:21:51
being an Avenger.
1:21:53
You touched on queer dating a little bit just now.
1:21:55
I wanted to ask what was it like back in the ‘90s to be dating as a
1:22:02
queer person in college in the ‘90s.
1:22:09
Yeah, the dating pool was very small.
1:22:11
There weren’t very many people who were out.
1:22:13
Lots of drama because of that.
1:22:17
I dated in Portland and also here.
1:22:22
One of the things that’s important to me is non-monogamy.
1:22:25
I’ve never been in a monogamous relationship.
1:22:27
It’s never been something that’s been important to me to have just
1:22:30
one partner who meets all my needs.
1:22:32
I’m not sure if that’s possible.
1:22:33
If you’re doing that, good work.
1:22:35
You have my applause, because I think that’s very hard.
1:22:40
A lot of people had city girlfriends.
1:22:43
People hooked up a lot of times at our topless all-girl dance
1:22:46
parties that we would host.
1:22:47
It was an outlet.
1:22:50
I think of sexuality as a necessary part of being human.
1:22:54
It can be central, not for everyone, but it can be central to
1:22:58
the life force or joy, pleasure, connection, those kinds of things.
1:23:02
We would host social spaces where women could hold hands or make out
1:23:06
or have sex in the bedroom, whatever it might be, or on the couch, but it
1:23:10
was really important to us to hold that space to meet each other, because
1:23:14
there were so few people that we, there just weren’t very many out people.
1:23:20
Getting us all in one room was important.
1:23:22
Being able to dance and have fun was important.
1:23:26
I think, you know, there was, dating can be hard when you’re in a
1:23:31
community that’s so much on lockdown.
1:23:35
I think there was, I remember the people at the Center Against Rape and
1:23:39
Domestic Violence there were these kind of conflicting reports that came out.
1:23:43
Some were like there’s no violence in lesbian communities because
1:23:47
there’s no unequal power dynamic like there is between a man or a woman.
1:23:51
Then a year later someone was like, there’s lots of, there’s still
1:23:56
domestic interpersonal violence, partnership violence in our communities.
1:24:02
People struggled a little bit, but at the time one of the things that I
1:24:07
love about being queer is it’s about our sexuality and that can be asexual.
1:24:10
It can be lesbian.
1:24:11
It can be bi.
1:24:11
It can be queer.
1:24:13
It can be gay.
1:24:15
It can be a lot of different varieties, but our sexuality back then was one
1:24:20
of the things that you united us.
1:24:21
That was really important.
1:24:23
Butch fem was really important.
1:24:25
I really appreciate that dynamic.
1:24:27
I still do as someone who was a masculine woman and pretty much universally despised
1:24:35
by heterosexual culture it was really lovely to find fems, like women who,
1:24:41
and not all fems are into butches or masculine people, but people who were
1:24:45
like no, no, no—I see you and I like you.
1:24:48
I like that you’re this way.
1:24:50
That was really healing and that felt really good.
1:24:52
Not everybody was into butch fem but a lot of
1:24:57
people who I looked up to or the people that I admired were.
1:25:00
Julie and I had a butch-fem relationship.
1:25:02
I also liked it because we could build it on egalitarian, healthy masculinity.
1:25:08
Being masculine didn’t have to be me repeating the unhealthy
1:25:11
patterns that I saw from my father or my brothers or my culture, or
1:25:15
my faith community, or whatever.
1:25:17
It was a chance to be like, okay, masculinity can be beautiful.
1:25:20
I can make it what I want.
1:25:22
I can cook.
1:25:23
I can clean.
1:25:23
I can nurture and still be masculine.
1:25:27
There’s no, it felt like there didn’t have to be limitations being a woman
1:25:31
or female participating in masculinity.
1:25:34
I’m trying to think.
1:25:35
There were some couples that were a long term.
1:25:38
I don’t think—I’m trying to think of who.
1:25:42
I’m not in touch with all Avengers anymore.
1:25:44
I think there’s one couple that’s still together, which is pretty amazing.
1:25:48
Most of us, as is pretty common I think in college, people broke
1:25:52
up or somebody graduated or left.
1:25:55
Julie and I are still friends.
1:25:58
I’m in touch a little bit with Carla [phonetic] , who is
1:26:00
one of the founding Avengers.
1:26:04
Yeah, dating was important.
1:26:06
I will say we did a pretty dang good job of having social space, sexual
1:26:12
space, and activist space all together, because that can be really challenging.
1:26:16
That can be really difficult.
1:26:18
We were able to braid those things together in a way that worked,
1:26:22
instead of them kind of stop.
1:26:25
I know some queers,
1:26:28
two people break up and that group’s gone.
1:26:30
It’s totally over, but that didn’t happen that I recall.
1:26:38
I
1:26:40
know you didn’t really have
1:26:45
a great relationship with your parents, but I kind of wanted to know if there
1:26:50
was any, did you stay in contact with them at all when you were in college and
1:26:55
if the Lesbian Avengers influenced that?
1:27:04
[Sighs] . No.
1:27:06
When I came out I came out to myself in the summer of my 18th year.
1:27:11
Then I got my feet under me, then I went home and I remember
1:27:17
telling my mom and her response was that she didn’t want me home
1:27:22
anymore because she didn’t want me around my little sisters because
1:27:25
she assumed I was a child molester.
1:27:27
There
1:27:30
was pretty an immediate you’re not welcome here.
1:27:35
We tried for probably ten, maybe 15 years.
1:27:40
I was like there’s got to be an angle.
1:27:41
There’s got to be something.
1:27:43
You raised me.
1:27:44
There’s got to be something in me that you see that you value.
1:27:47
I will say in her defense, and my dad in my early 20s he
1:27:51
just stopped talking to me.
1:27:55
He’s very conservative and religious and
1:28:01
he, like he was a big fundraiser for Measure VIII in California, so he’s
1:28:07
very anti-gay marriage, very much politically active against gay people.
1:28:11
He and I don’t talk at all.
1:28:12
We haven’t for a long time.
1:28:13
I didn’t even think—oh yeah, he has seen me once since I’ve transitioned
1:28:17
at one of my sister’s weddings.
1:28:20
With my
1:28:23
mom, in her defense I came out as a dyke at 18 and then came out as trans
1:28:28
in my mid 20s and then came out as a guy who’s into guys in my late 20s.
1:28:33
So, she had to deal with three comings-out.
1:28:34
Part of me is like, don’t you get better and better?
1:28:37
Like, sure the first time it’s a shock.
1:28:38
Second time, you’re like okay, I’ve done this.
1:28:40
Third time you should be pretty damn good at it.
1:28:43
No.
1:28:43
We don’t talk anymore.
1:28:45
She’s still very homophobic and
1:28:51
transphobic.
1:28:51
Of my siblings, two are also very homophobic and transphobic and then four
1:28:58
of us are either gay or trans or queer.
1:29:00
You know, that’s a lovely thing.
1:29:03
The “heathens” is how we think of ourselves kind of hanging together
1:29:06
and that’s not true—one is a really good ally, but she is heterosexual
1:29:11
and cis gender. With my family, I feel lucky that I kept some of my
1:29:16
siblings. I don’t have aunts, uncles.
1:29:21
My grandparents were really—I’m not really in contact with my
1:29:26
dad’s parents and they’re dead now.
1:29:30
My relationship to my mom’s dad, my grandfather, was really important.
1:29:34
He’s a white man.
1:29:37
He’s very prejudice against immigrants and Jews and people of color and women
1:29:42
and queers and trans people, but at a certain point I just kept being like,
1:29:49
okay, but there’s something here.
1:29:51
We’re family.
1:29:52
He definitely came around at least on the queer stuff.
1:29:57
He’s probably still, well he’s gone now, but he stayed prejudiced in a lot of ways.
1:30:02
He was the only person older than I am in my family who I knew without a
1:30:07
question of a doubt loved me and I don’t know how he wrapped his head around it,
1:30:11
because, again, he’s very prejudiced and biased but I knew that he loved me.
1:30:16
I knew that he loved me for who he was and he worked hard to get there.
1:30:20
That was really important to me, but, in terms of my parents, no.
1:30:26
Something that I hear is changing, that for young people like some people’s
1:30:31
parents are able to support them.
1:30:33
I don’t know if that’s true for any of you all.
1:30:35
That’s so important.
1:30:37
We make our own families.
1:30:38
We can create them if we need to, but that idea that you would stop loving
1:30:43
your kid because of who they are is just so harmful, just incredibly harmful.
1:30:54
What do you think would be the most important contribution that the Lesbian
1:31:02
Avengers made to both Corvallis and the Gay Rights Movement in general?
1:31:07
I
1:31:14
would say during a time when
1:31:21
oppression and discrimination and violence was the most overt and the most pronounced
1:31:28
during the early ‘90s with the OCA and the Measures IX and XIII, that was the time
1:31:32
when there was the most organized hatred.
1:31:36
People were not even shy about it.
1:31:38
It was just like, well, yes of course I hate gay people.
1:31:39
Why wouldn’t I?
1:31:41
During the time I feel like it was like this pressure cooker of
1:31:45
repression trying to lock people down.
1:31:47
I feel like the Lesbian Avengers, like our logo, pushed back on
1:31:51
that and made so much space.
1:31:53
We were like we will be inclusive of trans people.
1:31:56
We will work cross culturally or across difference to build coalition.
1:32:03
We will be flamboyant and loving and nurturing.
1:32:08
We will be artistic.
1:32:09
We will be joyful.
1:32:10
We will be beautiful.
1:32:10
We will be visible.
1:32:12
Instead of I feel like a lot of the campaigns carved out a small amount of
1:32:15
space and we tried to push back and push those boundaries and really create space.
1:32:22
Again, every now and again I’ll run into a young person and they
1:32:24
will tell me or, I don’t know, the fact that we have queer pride week.
1:32:30
I think it’s queer pride month on campus?
1:32:32
Am I right?
1:32:33
Some of the things that we just started in a small way have grown and grown.
1:32:37
The Pride Center.
1:32:38
I can remember going there last spring and just being in awe of
1:32:43
the people there and the young activists and just being like, wow.
1:32:47
This work has continued.
1:32:48
It’s even more nuanced and powerful and collaborative.
1:32:54
I don’t know.
1:32:56
Stuff like that just makes me feel really happy.
1:32:59
The Women’s Center is still there and having a chance to meet with the staff.
1:33:03
Again it was this thing of like we could have only hoped and dreamed for this
1:33:06
to happen and you all are doing it.
1:33:10
I imagine in my time things aren’t perfect, but seeing that that continues
1:33:14
and how far people have taken it, those things are deeply satisfying.
1:33:22
Within the Lesbian Avengers, I’m wondering your opinion.
1:33:28
What do you think was your most important contribution?
1:33:31
What are you most proud
1:33:35
of?
1:33:39
It felt so collective.
1:33:41
I don’t know.
1:33:47
I don’t know as one person.
1:33:51
I know I played a leadership role.
1:33:53
I know I helped get things done.
1:33:59
I think we all shared a mindset.
1:34:01
One of the things that’s most important to me is to be multi-issue,
1:34:04
that we weren’t like lesbian issues only, that we were like no.
1:34:08
We’ve got to work together.
1:34:09
I wouldn’t say just I brought that.
1:34:11
I think we all felt that way.
1:34:12
That’s something I’m really proud of us as Avengers, that we were
1:34:16
just like all of us or none of us.
1:34:18
We’ve got to work together, especially that we were inclusive around, again,
1:34:23
not just being you have to be cis and five-star lesbian or whatever else.
1:34:27
We were like, no.
1:34:29
We had Brian Parks was an Avenger.
1:34:33
He’s not a woman.
1:34:35
He’s queer, but we had, it was
1:34:41
like creating a family of your dreams of the people who, again,
1:34:45
loved you and saw you and helped you, but we did that collectively.
1:34:49
I wouldn’t say it was just me.
1:34:51
I am really proud of the stuff I did on campus, like being the first
1:34:56
LGBTQ advocate, starting Queer Pride Week and we had a tent in the quad.
1:35:04
We were shot at.
1:35:05
We had the ROTC came and did calisthenics and sung an anti-gay
1:35:11
chant at like 5:00 in the morning.
1:35:14
When we were trying to be visible there was so much pushback but I’m proud that
1:35:18
we stood strong and that we were like, we’re not going to be intimidated.
1:35:24
We can see through this for what it is, which is fear and insecurity,
1:35:27
and that’s not worth growing.
1:35:28
That’s not something that I have to bow to be afraid of in some ways.
1:35:38
How
1:35:44
is—I’m trying to figure out how to say this... how did you cope with a
1:35:52
lot of the discrimination you faced, especially when you were younger before
1:35:59
you came out or even after you came out?
1:36:01
How did you cope with the discrimination?
1:36:05
I
1:36:11
think compartmentalizing was really valuable, trying to be—one thing that’s
1:36:18
been really important to me for my whole life is that idea of that’s not about me.
1:36:23
That’s about them.
1:36:25
If I was in
1:36:28
high school and somebody called me “lessie,” it’s like, well, that doesn’t
1:36:33
reflect on me. That reflects on them. That’s been incredibly valuable.
1:36:37
I think having a sense of activism, that I don’t have to passively accept
1:36:43
the conditions of the world, that we can push back and fight back.
1:36:47
Once I did find friends who were out and who, again, the Lesbian Avengers
1:36:52
were my first group of people who were out and celebrating queerness,
1:36:55
and that was incredibly healing.
1:36:59
Turning that anger and frustration into action was really important, making
1:37:05
art and beauty was really important.
1:37:06
The visuals, the t-shirts, the posters, and the scrapbooks,
1:37:12
that saying or the slogan: we take the fire within us, we
1:37:15
take it and make it our own.
1:37:17
Just being like, this isn’t going to destroy us.
1:37:19
It’s going to fuel us.
1:37:21
That was really important.
1:37:25
Nurturing, like paying it forward, paying it backward, trying to make sure that
1:37:30
I’m leaving whatever community I’m in—I won’t say better, but making more space
1:37:36
for people to be their authentic selves.
1:37:39
Stuff like that.
1:37:40
Some crying.
1:37:42
Some
1:37:45
cocktails.
1:37:47
A lot of the normal stuff that people do.
1:37:56
I think my connections with people are what saved my life, though, for
1:37:58
sure because there had been many, many times when I just was like, there
1:38:02
is not a place in this world for me.
1:38:04
I cannot do this another day.
1:38:05
I cannot handle this, but having people see me and love me and
1:38:14
just, it’s not like we tell each other it’s going to be okay, because
1:38:18
I don’t know if it’s going to be okay.
1:38:19
But we will stand by each other.
1:38:21
We will support each other.
1:38:22
We will be there for each other to the end, whatever the end looks like.
1:38:27
That messaging is really important to me to give and get and those
1:38:30
people in my life who have shown me that, it’s been incredibly important.
1:38:39
Could you share your thoughts on how you feel about the way that
1:38:44
language has changed in the queer community in the past 20, 30 years.
1:38:50
That’s a good question.
1:38:52
I love the word queer as a descriptor of our sexuality, for
1:38:56
someone like me who was a dyke and is now I would say fag identified.
1:39:00
It’s a good word that describes that process without having to
1:39:03
spell things out or go into detail.
1:39:06
I
1:39:08
was just reading last night just for my own interest, MOGII, which is Marginalized
1:39:16
Orientations, Gender alignment something, like the acronyms [Marginalized
1:39:20
Orientations, Gender Identities, and Intersex] . LGBTQ, which has expanded and
1:39:23
contracted, depending on who’s included.
1:39:26
QUILTBAG is cute and also, if you all don’t know, that’s like Queer,
1:39:31
Unidentified, Intersex, Lesbian, Trans, Bisexual, Asexual, Gay.
1:39:38
It’s more inclusive than LGBTQ.
1:39:42
I love that we’re wrestling with that language constantly.
1:39:46
I loved deciding who is a lesbian just kind of being like, okay, is a
1:39:50
woman who dated young men all through high school but still identifies
1:39:53
as a lesbian, is she a lesbian?
1:39:56
She says she is, she is.
1:39:57
These questions of identity I love.
1:40:00
We said this earlier when the camera wasn’t on, but I love the young people
1:40:03
are leading the way and teaching us different ways to think about this and
1:40:07
it is young people who even put trans people on the radar, non-binary people.
1:40:12
I think my elders were like: you got gay; you got lesbian, straight
1:40:16
people—that’s all there is.
1:40:18
Young people have been the ones to be like, no.
1:40:20
There’s so much more.
1:40:21
That’s super lovely.
1:40:23
I don’t feel compelled.
1:40:24
I was just having a conversation with some really amazing
1:40:27
people who I admire in Latinx:
1:40:32
Latine/Latino/Latina community about the history of Latinx and talking about
1:40:36
where did this come from and I remember one person saying, listen, having as many
1:40:43
different kinds of—because I was like
1:40:48
in this clumsy way of being like, okay tell me what’s the best
1:40:51
term that’s the most inclusive.
1:40:52
Hearing back people being like, listen it’s lovely that there’s more than
1:40:56
one term that fights colonialism.
1:40:57
It honors indigeneity,
1:41:01
the idea that there’s not just one word for one concept.
1:41:06
We don’t need one word to unify us.
1:41:08
It’s beautiful that there’s lots of different words.
1:41:11
Hearing that, it just reminded me of how these conversations
1:41:15
will keep going on forever.
1:41:17
We’re not doing ourselves any favors when we stab ourselves in the
1:41:19
back, when there’s in-fighting, but
1:41:23
creating more language is, I don’t know, that’s always a beautiful thing.
1:41:27
I love how it’s evolved.
1:41:29
Again, when I got here it was the Gay and Lesbian Alliance.
1:41:32
There was a group even before that, and I can’t remember what they were called.
1:41:36
Do any of you know?
1:41:38
It was something really subtle.
1:41:40
It was not, I don’t even think it had the word gay in it.
1:41:45
I’m thinking of the GSA.
1:41:47
No.
1:41:47
It was before Gay and Lesbian Alliance.
1:41:50
It was a club at OSU.
1:41:52
Anyway, I can’t remember.
1:41:53
Someone knows.
1:41:54
It was like, “the people’s club” or something like that,
1:41:57
where you’re like, okay, yeah.
1:41:59
Then there was the Gay and Lesbian Alliance.
1:42:01
Then there was a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Alliance.
1:42:04
Then Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Alliance.
1:42:07
That’s when I left off at OSU.
1:42:09
Pride Center’s great.
1:42:10
I know there’s been other stuff.
1:42:13
These questions are, I think, they’re wonderful.
1:42:16
We should keep having these conversations.
1:42:22
What do you do now after college?
1:42:25
Yes.
1:42:26
That’s a good question.
1:42:28
I had wanted to work in forestry and that’s what I studied
1:42:31
and what I graduated in.
1:42:33
My last year of school OSU had an international forestry degree.
1:42:37
I wanted to work globally to figure out, okay, there are
1:42:41
indigenous people-owned lands.
1:42:42
There’s tourism.
1:42:43
There’s trees.
1:42:46
There’s mining.
1:42:47
There’s whatever, looking at what are the most harmonious ways that we can
1:42:51
make sure the people who have stewarded the land forever make the decisions.
1:42:57
I had a chance to, through OSU, I got an internship working
1:43:04
as a white water rafting guide doing ecotourism in Honduras.
1:43:09
While I was there on the plane down I met a Canadian human rights lawyer.
1:43:13
He is a gay man named Richard, and he was going down to, he was
1:43:19
traveling to study what is happening with gay rights in the country.
1:43:22
It was a very incredibly dangerous time for people who lived there.
1:43:26
I remember he was like, hey, I found a gay bar, the one gay bar in the whole country.
1:43:32
It was a bar.
1:43:35
When we went, it seemed to me mostly what I would identify now as trans
1:43:38
women, I think mostly women who were working and then maybe some tourists.
1:43:44
While we were there we were just having drinks and flirting and dancing and
1:43:48
the military police showed up with machine guns and were like everybody
1:43:52
line up in the bar and they, most people who weren’t Honduran—you didn’t
1:44:00
always carry your passport, so neither Richard or I had our passports.
1:44:05
They were like, you two you can go.
1:44:06
We were like, no.
1:44:08
We know if we leave there won’t be witnesses to whatever
1:44:12
you’re going to do next.
1:44:14
But they had machine guns and they were like go.
1:44:16
So, we stepped outside the door but we stayed.
1:44:20
The police were inside, or the military, I’m not quite sure which.
1:44:23
We stayed for about 45 minutes just trying to be like what
1:44:28
the hell is happening in there?
1:44:32
That happened in addition to a ton of street harassment and things like
1:44:35
that, though the woman I was doing an internship with, I assumed from the way
1:44:41
that I looked that she knew I was queer, but when I mentioned I have a girlfriend
1:44:46
she freaked out and she said I don’t want you around my daughter anymore.
1:44:50
My internship ended because she was like, get out.
1:44:53
You have to leave.
1:44:54
I was like, okay.
1:44:55
I’m in Honduras for two more weeks with no place to stay.
1:45:00
That happened and then I had a job fighting forest fires in
1:45:05
rural Idaho and in the panhandle.
1:45:07
There,
1:45:10
again, when I would go to go get groceries or something people would
1:45:13
follow me home in cars and say, I want to kill you, you fucking dyke.
1:45:17
It just was—I was like okay, where the trees are it is not safe
1:45:22
for me to be as a butch woman.
1:45:25
I was like, okay I need to rethink this whole forestry thing.
1:45:28
I was trying to put together a job with a crew out of Eugene,
1:45:35
but because we had to put our resumes to get jobs, sort of like what our crew was,
1:45:40
and most of my jobs at the university and on campus had been queer rights
1:45:45
stuff, so, it was like “Coordinator of Lesbian, Gay, Bis.” We just kept not
1:45:49
getting jobs and so eventually they just told me not to, they were kind
1:45:53
of like, we’re not going to get jobs as long as you are a part of our team.
1:45:56
Stuff like that kept happening.
1:45:58
I was like, okay.
1:46:02
Right at that time the Benton County Health Department had a job doing
1:46:06
HIV prevention with gay and bi men.
1:46:09
I wasn’t identifying as male, but I was like, well I could
1:46:13
do this for like a minute.
1:46:14
I took that job and just went into public health and never looked back.
1:46:18
It was much more welcoming, much less dangerous, less life threatening.
1:46:22
I have done a lot of public health work since then.
1:46:26
I worked at the Sexual Minority Young Recreation Resource Center in Portland.
1:46:33
The first year it was open I got to be their HIV Prevention Coordinator,
1:46:37
the Volunteer Coordinator, and I ran it for I think three or four months.
1:46:43
I started Gender Machine Works.
1:46:49
Now
1:46:52
I facilitated the youth group at my synagogue for a while.
1:46:59
Then now I facilitated a young Jewish activist group of all queer people.
1:47:04
I co-facilitate that.
1:47:06
I do a lot of volunteering and activism.
1:47:09
I’m not in forestry anymore.
1:47:11
When I came to visit OSU, what was it six months ago, it was really amazing
1:47:16
to meet students who were in forestry.
1:47:18
I remember somebody saying, yeah the first forestry professor
1:47:22
I had was a non-binary person.
1:47:24
That was like mind-blowing.
1:47:26
It made me so happy, because that was not happening when I was here at all.
1:47:31
I’m in public health stuff now.
1:47:33
Mostly I’m a sex ed teacher and I work with high school and
1:47:37
middle school students and teach a class at PSU teaching sex ed.
1:47:43
I did make a career.
1:47:44
It was not in forestry, though.
1:47:46
I miss it.
1:47:47
Sometimes people are like, do you ever wish you had been able to?
1:47:50
I’m like, yeah.
1:47:50
That’s what I, from when I was young that’s what I wanted to be.
1:47:53
That’s what I trained to be, but it just was too dangerous for me.
1:47:59
Maybe someone else could have, but it was too much for me.
1:48:06
What was it like transitioning in the time you did?
1:48:12
What kind of supports did you have?
1:48:18
In the mid-‘90s was when I started to get an inkling, again, that something besides
1:48:23
me being a butch dyke was going on.
1:48:26
There was very little trans visibility at all, and what there
1:48:30
was had been created by trans women.
1:48:34
There were groups for trans women.
1:48:37
Again, the internet was just starting to be a thing.
1:48:40
There were trans women online who were creating space, but not much for
1:48:44
trans masculine or trans guy people.
1:48:47
I remember a photographer named Loren Cameron put out a book of portraits.
1:48:53
I don’t remember what it was called, but it was photographs of trans guys.
1:48:58
I remember seeing it at Powell’s or something and just being like, oh!
1:49:04
This is a thing.
1:49:06
I knew that if I transitioned or took steps towards it I would lose this
1:49:13
community that was really important to me because I wouldn’t be a woman anymore.
1:49:17
There was also the urgency, or dysphoria, where it’s like I can’t live
1:49:20
in my body and then also the social
1:49:24
being perceived as male and feeling that was “right,” but then also it
1:49:31
being like a huge threat. There was, I’m
1:49:38
trying to think, I saw that book of portraits.
1:49:40
I remember being like, okay if I were going to transition
1:49:43
would I take testosterone?
1:49:45
Would I have surgery?
1:49:48
Back then no insurance was covering it.
1:49:51
It was all out of pocket.
1:49:52
I remember you had to do the real life test.
1:49:56
You were supposed to live as a year whatever your new sex without any hormones
1:50:04
or surgery, which is incredibly dangerous.
1:50:07
I remember I had to go to therapy, too.
1:50:09
I had had experiences, forced therapy, as a young person that were
1:50:13
incredibly traumatic and harmful, so to have to go to therapy again.
1:50:19
I was like, ugh.
1:50:20
I don’t want to do this.
1:50:21
It turned out, I think the therapist was doing the best that she could.
1:50:25
It was Phoenix Rising, so, it was like a LGBT,
1:50:31
I’m going to say an LGB therapist community.
1:50:33
She asked questions like, well, what gym are you going to go to?
1:50:36
I’m was like, that doesn’t make me a man.
1:50:40
Working out doesn’t make me a man.
1:50:42
At the time it was very important that people, they didn’t want
1:50:47
people to transition and become gay.
1:50:49
So, it was like, okay but you’re still going to be attracted to women, right?
1:50:52
So, you’re going to be a man who’s attracted to women?
1:50:55
I was like, I guess.
1:50:57
I don’t know.
1:51:00
The gate keeping was very strong.
1:51:01
I had to go through that.
1:51:04
I remember going to my endocrinologist when I finally got hormones,
1:51:10
or I got okayed for hormones.
1:51:13
She, although she’s an endocrinologist, was like tell me about your childhood.
1:51:17
Tell me about—it was this gate keeping where I’m like, you’re not a psychologist.
1:51:20
I had to pay money and go through this gate keeping and jump through
1:51:25
hoops with the psychologist.
1:51:27
Now the endocrinologist was doing the same thing, even though her job was to be like,
1:51:31
okay, you’ve passed all this other stuff.
1:51:33
Here’s a bottle of testosterone.
1:51:35
I remember Julie and I think we were living together, or she drove me.
1:51:42
I had tried to find trans-inclusive healthcare in Eugene or Corvallis
1:51:47
and people literally were like, we don’t do that type of thing.
1:51:49
I was like, not a thing.
1:51:51
It’s also just hormones.
1:51:52
It’s not—you could, but you’re choosing not to.
1:51:56
Okay, whatever.
1:51:57
I’d go to Portland to get it.
1:51:59
She drove me up.
1:52:00
I remember it was December 31, 1998.
1:52:03
I got the bottle, the little bottle of testosterone.
1:52:08
They were like, do you know how to inject it?
1:52:10
I was like, sure, yeah, yeah.
1:52:11
Totally.
1:52:11
I was like, do not stop me.
1:52:13
I don’t need another barrier.
1:52:16
I had found in a zine somewhere there was a step by step how to inject testosterone.
1:52:22
I was like, alright.
1:52:24
We went home.
1:52:24
I was 11:00 p.m. at night.
1:52:26
I was like, I’m doing this.
1:52:27
I was like, okay I need to be alone.
1:52:29
I was all alone in my room.
1:52:31
I remember having it and looking at the zine and being like, oh God I hope I did
1:52:35
this right and injecting my first shot.
1:52:38
It was really hard-won.
1:52:42
I had changed my name a few years before, which my dyke
1:52:47
community was so supportive of.
1:52:48
I remember they held a party and there was a “it’s a boy,” “it’s a girl”
1:52:53
banners that you can get for a birth.
1:52:55
It was like “it’s a boy,” “it’s a girl,” above the door.
1:52:57
People were really celebratory, which I really appreciated a lot.
1:53:01
Doing that felt a little more personal and individual and obviously
1:53:05
many changes happened since.
1:53:07
I remember the next morning waking up, and it was December, right?
1:53:10
Well, it was January then.
1:53:11
But my feet were warm and I was like yes!
1:53:17
[Laughs] . Testosterone is going make it so my feet are warm, which is so goofy,
1:53:20
but I remember that happening and being like, okay, this is going to be okay.
1:53:28
Could you talk a little bit about the shift in privileges that happened?
1:53:36
After and sort of while you were transitioning
1:53:41
and after you transitioned?
1:53:42
That’s a good, yeah that’s a long, long conversation.
1:53:53
I was a pretty masculine girl my whole life, so I don’t know what
1:53:56
it’s like to be a feminine girl.
1:54:00
I’ve mentioned a few times there were times during my childhood that
1:54:05
I passed—that’s a complicated word but I’m just going to use it as
1:54:09
shorthand—as a boy and that felt affirming but also really dangerous
1:54:15
because I knew I was going to found out.
1:54:18
Being a masculine queer woman was, I think of it was chronic and acute.
1:54:24
That felt chronically dangerous.
1:54:27
All the violence that happens against women.
1:54:29
All the violence that happens against queers and also against people who
1:54:31
are gender variant in some way.
1:54:34
That was a huge focus and I’m talking job discrimination, violence, harassment,
1:54:38
sexual violence, in community violence, out community—because I think cis gender
1:54:45
and/or heterosexual people are like, oh, LGBTQ, one big happy family, but
1:54:49
you all probably know we still will cause harm even in our community around
1:54:53
racism or around transphobia, biphobia, invisibilizing, sexism, all those kinds of
1:54:58
things are still in play, unfortunately.
1:55:01
When I started transitioning, it became really clear to me that I was
1:55:08
exchanging some type of cis gender privilege, a privilege of having a
1:55:16
body that at least nominally matched my assigned sex and I apologize for
1:55:20
getting a little intellectual here.
1:55:24
I had been assigned female and as long as I was a girl or a woman
1:55:27
I could always fall back on that.
1:55:29
No matter what I look like, it was still like a doctor would still
1:55:32
be like, well, you’re a female.
1:55:34
You’re a masculine female, but you’re still female, right?
1:55:37
I had that, what I would consider cig gender privilege, even though,
1:55:40
again, I wasn’t like a feminine girl.
1:55:43
When I transitioned, I had to give up that and it’s a lot.
1:55:46
It’s federal rights.
1:55:47
It’s state rights.
1:55:48
It’s family security, dating.
1:55:54
All my education and job history was under my female name.
1:55:58
When I transitioned, I had to start a career.
1:56:01
If I listed a reference or my job or something, it was all under a female name.
1:56:09
There’s this very before and after period.
1:56:12
I would say how I look now, I definitely get male privilege.
1:56:17
It’s revocable and superficial.
1:56:20
There’s
1:56:24
always the threat of being found out.
1:56:27
One of the things I notice is say we go to a café or coffee shop.
1:56:32
The person behind the counter would often overlook a woman who was in
1:56:36
front of me and be like, oh, can I help you sir? I think because I
1:56:41
was such an ardent feminist I’d be like, oh she was here before me.
1:56:45
I can push back on that.
1:56:47
It’s clear to me that the minute someone finds out that I’m trans that
1:56:51
is gone in an instant and I have to deal with transphobia and homophobia.
1:56:56
It’s really complicated.
1:56:58
I think people want to make it linear and simple, and it’s not.
1:57:04
It’s not at all.
1:57:07
I think of being a girl and a woman as a protective factor.
1:57:11
So, moving from a women's community there isn’t an equivalent of a men's community.
1:57:17
Men are not actually, I’m generalizing here, but it’s been my experience
1:57:23
that men, even queer men, aren’t great at taking care of each other.
1:57:26
It’s very dog-eat-dog and hierarchical.
1:57:30
If you’re a trans guy you’re not high on the hierarchy.
1:57:35
There’s a lot of violence that men are going to visit against you.
1:57:39
I had to give up what felt like some safety and security, and I love this,
1:57:44
anywhere I went as a woman there was like, oh you’re a woman, too.
1:57:49
We’re going to, and, again, we harm each other in plenty of ways, but it was like,
1:57:53
oh we can, especially queer women, it was like oh we’ll, I’ll slide you the free
1:57:57
coffee or I’m going to make it just a little bit easier for you to do whatever.
1:58:00
Women in forestry, we hung together because it was like we
1:58:04
have this thing in common and becoming legally male I lost that.
1:58:11
I gained superficial male privilege, for sure.
1:58:15
People listen to me more when I talk.
1:58:19
Especially someone who’s white and looks male, people they
1:58:24
give more weight to my opinions.
1:58:26
I noticed feeling much safer in the world, like when I was a woman
1:58:30
walking down the street at night I would constantly be scanning or
1:58:34
being like am I safe?
1:58:35
What’s going to happen?
1:58:36
I don’t do that anymore,
1:58:40
because people read me as cis, cisgender.
1:58:43
But I know I’m being misgendered and that sucks, because people are
1:58:47
like—I’ve gone to trans events and people are like what are you doing here?
1:58:52
There’s an event in Portland called, T*Party.
1:58:54
We named ourselves before the conservative movement called
1:58:57
Tea Party, but T was for trans.
1:59:00
We hold it in a park and it’s this big celebration.
1:59:02
It’s like, we had it during—my friend and I started it because gay pride just
1:59:09
never had anything for trans people.
1:59:11
So, it’s like okay we’re going to have this event on Friday before the
1:59:14
pride weekend, so there’s at least one thing that we all can go to.
1:59:18
Like, 200 people would show up.
1:59:19
It was a popular draw, but one year I was cleaning off a table
1:59:26
or something and someone was like what are you even doing here?
1:59:29
This isn’t for people like you.
1:59:31
I was like, I started this.
1:59:35
I get misgendered because of cis gender people’s, no offence, lack of
1:59:40
imagination of who could be trans.
1:59:42
People will see me and be like, no.
1:59:44
But I also recognize that from someone who has lived being in between male
1:59:49
and female, I know how dangerous that is and I know that some people
1:59:53
will never choose to or be able to be perceived as one or the other.
1:59:58
I know I get a lot of safety and privilege by being perceived as male, even though
2:00:02
that’s misgendering, even though that’s not who I am or who I know myself to be.
2:00:08
One thing that I’ve noticed is now when I walk down the street, if it’s at night
2:00:12
sometimes I see women cross the street to not be with me and it’s so painful.
2:00:18
I also get it.
2:00:19
People who look like me perpetuate a ton of violence.
2:00:23
Whether I would do that or not is not relevant to her, because she’s
2:00:28
doing her best to keep herself safe.
2:00:31
It’s one of those things where I’m like, I just want to be like ah!
2:00:34
We have more in common than we do not.
2:00:38
But I understand.
2:00:39
It’s complicated.
2:00:41
That was a great question.
2:00:42
I love that that conversation is happening, especially across
2:00:46
race and culture and language and gender and orientation.
2:00:49
We definitely need to keep talking about
2:00:54
that.
2:00:55
After everything you have been through, if you could go back to your younger
2:00:59
self at any point in your life, what would you want to tell yourself?
2:01:06
I played this game a ton, especially with trans friends.
2:01:10
I felt like I wouldn’t do it.
2:01:12
My younger self would have been so freaked out if I showed up and was
2:01:15
like, hey [laughs] . I feel like she would have been like, what the hell?
2:01:22
I don’t
2:01:25
know.
2:01:26
If I could, I would tell that little kid you’re good how you are.
2:01:33
You can make a life.
2:01:34
It’s not going to be easy.
2:01:36
You’re going to find people who value you.
2:01:39
You’re going to find people who love you and who can be your family.
2:01:45
Just tell her to stay strong.
2:01:49
Tell her to stay open-minded.
2:01:50
There’s going to be some changes, but yeah.
2:01:53
I feel like she would be pretty freaked out [laughs] if I was like, hi.
2:01:56
I’m you from the future.
2:01:58
She’d be like, okay [laughs] . But yeah, that’s a great question.
2:02:07
Is there anything else that you wanted to share that you think we didn’t touch on?
2:02:12
That’s a lot.
2:02:12
We covered a lot of territory.
2:02:13
Thank you.
2:02:13
Thank the three of you.
2:02:14
I really appreciate your time and your care and your enthusiasm
2:02:18
and your care and your questions.
2:02:22
It’s been a pleasure.
2:02:23
Thank you.
2:02:24
Thank you.
2:02:25
Thank you.
2:02:25
Thank you.
