00:01
Good morning.
00:02
This is History 368 at Oregon State University.
00:06
I’m Mina Carson.
00:06
I’m the instructor.
00:08
Did
00:10
I say the date—it’s February 5th, 2020.
00:13
And we’re delighted to have two guests today, Trystan Reese and Biff Chaplow.
00:17
And I’m
00:21
going to ask them to give their pronouns and say anything else we’ve
00:27
talked before about what they might do in here, tell some stories, and then
00:34
entertain questions from the class.
00:37
So, without further ado, how do you do, and thanks for being here.
00:41
Of course.
00:43
I’m Biff.
00:44
I use they/them pronouns.
00:46
I’m married to Trystan.
00:48
We’ve been married for,
00:51
coming up about ten years.
00:53
Is that ten years?
00:53
We’ve been together for about ten years, yeah.
00:58
Yeah.
00:59
A long time.
01:00
[Audience snaps]
01:00
Thank you, both of you.
01:00
Yeah.
01:05
That’s it, right?
01:07
And I’m Trystan.
01:09
I use he/him.
01:11
And I’m married to Biff.
01:15
I think we’re supposed to start by telling our stories.
01:17
Sure.
01:19
You can go first though.
01:20
Damn it.
01:20
[Laughs]
01:22
Ok, I am 37 years old, which sounds really old when I say it out loud.
01:33
Let’s see—I live in Portland.
01:35
A little bit about me—I’m from California, but not any of the cool parts.
01:42
I’m from the Antelope Valley, which is hours – hours – northeast of LA
01:46
in the middle of the Mojave Desert, next to Edwards Air Force Base.
01:53
Not sure if anybody else is from a small town here, but shout-out.
01:59
I was assigned female at birth.
02:03
And I had a pretty normal, I guess, girlhood, two parents
02:08
who are still together.
02:13
Except they were Canadian so they were just a little bit cooler
02:15
than everybody else’s parents.
02:20
[Laughs] For many years, it felt like there was something going on with
02:23
me, but I didn’t know what it was.
02:25
This is kind of dark ages, like the 90s.
02:32
It was just dark ages in trans years.
02:34
It really is.
02:36
And it really wasn’t until I was 18, 19, 20, and living here in Corvallis that I
02:40
realized there was a word for this thing that I always felt was different about me.
02:46
It was here where I met my very first transgender person who actually,
02:50
for some of the queer nerds in the room, was Micah Bazant who
02:54
is a very famous trans artist and
03:00
also spent time here in Corvallis.
03:02
And we met.
03:03
I was like, “Holy shit. I’m not broken.
03:04
I’m just trans.” Then I realized there was a solution to these issues that I’ve had.
03:10
I started transitioning when I was around 20, which is early 2000s.
03:19
When I first went to the doctor to transition—well I’ve been taking hormones
03:22
on the black market for a long time.
03:25
I didn’t think of it as black market.
03:27
My friends were just giving me their leftover hormones and I was
03:30
just giving them money for it.
03:32
But in retrospect, I’m like “that was illegal,”
03:37
in addition to not being a good idea physically, because the
03:40
doctor should be checking you out.
03:42
But the first time I went to see a doctor, an oncologist as the best I could find
03:45
cuz I finally had health insurance.
03:46
And he told me that when I started testosterone, it would render my
03:51
uterus an uninhabitable environment.
03:55
It’s now been 16 years and I still remember that phrase so
03:58
clearly cuz it’s very stark.
04:00
At the time, I didn’t care.
04:01
I was like, “Give me the beard juice.”
04:05
And at 20, who’s thinking really about having a kid?
04:08
Not a lot of people.
04:09
So I did not care.
04:13
And then I went to performing arts school.
04:14
I transitioned while I was in performing arts school.
04:17
Emerged into the world looking pretty close to what you see today like
04:20
every other gay guy in Portland.
04:24
Yeah.
04:25
And then I had a bunch of years in there where things were shitty.
04:28
And then I met Biff who saved me just by being awesome and not
04:32
mean to me and—I mean, low bar!
04:39
[Audience laughs]
04:39
Then we met and fell in love.
04:43
And Biff was the best person I’ve ever met, and the cutest.
04:51
And a year after we met, a year in change, we ended up becoming parents
04:59
overnight to his niece and nephew.
05:01
Then 3 years ago, we legally adopted them.
05:06
We became their forever family.
05:09
Then I decided that I wanted to get pregnant and have our baby.
05:13
I told Biff that I wanted to do this.
05:15
And Biff was like, “That’s stupid.” But after a long period
05:19
of time, Biff was like, “fine,” which was not really romantic,
05:25
just what I was hoping for, what I imagined having a baby with someone.
05:29
But you take what you can get.
05:32
And then we had a baby who’s now two and a half.
05:36
When we told our story publicly, we worked with CNN and People Magazine, and
05:43
Washington Post, some reputable outlets I wanted to partner with to tell our story.
05:51
If you’re curious at all about professional stuff, professional life
05:55
overlay, for most of my early adulthood, I was a national organizer with the
06:02
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which is now the National LGBTQ Task Force.
06:06
I spent seven years traveling the country, working on LGBT ballot measures.
06:10
I got to do other things in there too.
06:12
I got to work on the campaign of the death penalty in the state of California.
06:16
Got to work on a lot of pro-choice issues.
06:21
That’s sort of the professional overlay.
06:23
Now I get to do queer parenting work for a living, so I work with Family of Quality.
06:27
And I get to help queer people figure out how they want to form families.
06:31
Yeah, that’s a little bit about me.
06:35
So I’m 34.
06:39
I was born on the East Coast.
06:41
My parents moved also to a California desert town.
06:44
A lot of people don’t realize this about California, but what we see in the
06:51
media and in the movies, it’s very much the liberal parts of California which
06:58
do contain more people than the shitty parts.
07:02
But there are some parts of California that are really shitty.
07:05
So
07:07
that’s one of the places that I grew up.
07:11
My parents moved there when I was
07:14
12.
07:16
In fact, Kevin McCarthy—you all who know Kevin McCarthy is, he’s
07:24
the Minority Leader in the House of Representatives for the
07:27
Republicans—represents Bakersfield which is where I grew up.
07:32
He’s been representing them since I lived there, actually.
07:39
I was a very gay kid, always.
07:41
I never really had this process of discovering myself.
07:48
People definitely were telling me I was gay before I was
07:51
really thinking about that.
07:54
And that’s fine, I don’t mind.
07:55
I don’t mind being a gay kid.
08:00
But it always meant that I never had the experience of—the truth is, you
08:06
have privilege when you can hide that and you could choose when people see
08:10
that, when people don’t see that.
08:12
But when you are feminine as a man, people always assume that about
08:18
you whether or not it’s correct.
08:20
I never had the privilege to hide that, or the option to hide that.
08:24
Looking back, I see that as a privilege because I’ve seen a lot of friends,
08:31
family go through experiences where they really struggled with their identity
08:40
because it wasn’t forced out there all the time.
08:42
But it was never an option for me to not deal with it.
08:45
So pretty early on, I just accepted that.
08:51
I trusted my instincts in what felt right and what didn’t feel right.
08:59
I was raised really religious.
09:00
My parents are evangelical.
09:03
Not that way anymore.
09:04
So there’s a lot of experiences overlaid with
09:11
being raised in an evangelical life.
09:15
There are many positive, good things about that.
09:19
For real, there are.
09:21
But then they’re overlaid with judgement and rejection, and the
09:26
not-Christ-like behavior that I experienced after coming out publicly
09:33
or taking the steps to actually live a gay lifestyle, i.e. having a boyfriend.
09:42
So
09:44
yeah.
09:44
When I turned 18, I was intent on leaving Bakersfield.
09:47
I knew that that was not the place where I was going to excel, that
09:53
everything was an uphill battle always, in the workplace, in school, socially.
09:59
I
10:02
was assaulted in Bakersfield.
10:04
So
10:06
I made the decision to move to Los Angeles, where I stumbled
10:10
into a career of homeless work.
10:15
Some shelter gave me a job in a position I was way not qualified to
10:23
take.
10:23
But it turned out that I was good at it.
10:27
So yeah, my break into being radicalized was a combination
10:32
of college debate—I don’t know if there’s any debaters in here—
10:37
No.
10:37
Okay.
10:38
Thank goodness.
10:42
—and in my work of homelessness, you really see the impact of all
10:47
these systems that we talk about when you look at issues of poverty.
10:52
I’m always interested in and feel really impacted by the ways that poverty
10:58
intersects with our lives, especially as
11:05
queer people.
11:05
I would say by the time I met Trystan, I was definitely radicalized.
11:09
And I mean that in the most positive sense.
11:15
We say “woke” now.
11:18
[Audience laughs]
11:18
I’m not going to use that word.
11:22
But I had never dated a trans person before.
11:26
I would say my upbringing as a young adult was definitely gay male
11:31
upbringing, mainly because when you live in a small town, people can’t afford
11:37
to divide themselves up very much.
11:41
There’s one bar, it’s a gay male bar and that’s where you just
11:44
have to go because you would risk getting assaulted at the other bars.
11:50
I
11:52
would say I was very much entrenched into gay male culture.
11:55
I was doing a lot of things in L.A. to try to affect or change gay male culture.
11:59
There was a lot of problems then—and still now—with gay male culture.
12:10
I feel like there could be a whole course on
12:14
the microcosm of gay male culture and how it really reflects the disparities
12:19
between feminine people and masculine people, and what is valued and not valued,
12:24
cuz it basically just replicates what straight culture’s doing all the time.
12:32
In any case, by the time we met Trystan, I had never dated a trans person before.
12:39
But I had lots of friends that were—the people that
12:42
introduced us were—gender queer.
12:48
This is ten years ago where that was not really a widely known thing.
12:54
We were introduced by those people.
12:55
And it’s not like “I never dated somebody trans”, but that was
13:00
really just about happenstance.
13:02
I also never really thought about it.
13:06
So yeah, I met Trystan.
13:08
It was not love at first sight.
13:11
On their part.
13:13
But I might.
13:14
But that’s mainly because I was with somebody at the time.
13:20
And I didn’t want
13:25
to cheat on that person, I guess.
13:30
So we got together, like Trystan said, pretty early on in our relationship.
13:36
My niece and nephew—Lucas and Hailey are their names—needed
13:42
a place to live.
13:43
And we just jumped in to take them, not really knowing where that might go.
13:49
But it definitely went to a permanent place very fast.
13:54
Like a lot people in queer circles and culture, we had to grow
14:00
up really fast in that regard.
14:01
I mean I had to grow up fast anyways, not having family support, financial support
14:08
from people—you just gotta grow up.
14:12
When a lot of people are 18 and out having a good time, or maybe traveling,
14:18
like studying abroad and stuff like that, that was just not an option in my life.
14:23
That’s why I didn’t finish school.
14:24
There just wasn’t any—I didn’t see a—path forward for me.
14:31
And when you’re really poor, which we were also very poor, things like
14:36
student loans do not feel accessible.
14:39
Your family is not socialized to be financially smart so, there,
14:44
you don’t even know about things.
14:46
Needless to say, I didn’t finish school.
14:49
And I feel okay about that now.
14:53
So then we met, had a relationship.
14:56
I’m still very much in love with Trystan.
14:58
We were pretty much from the beginning.
15:02
We know we’d end up head over heels.
15:03
And we had a really great first kid-less year.
15:10
And then Lucas and Hailey came along.
15:14
They’re wonderful, beautiful creatures.
15:18
They really are.
15:22
I decided to start sitting home with Lucas and Hailey when we
15:25
moved from L.A. to Portland.
15:27
That’s almost seven years ago now.
15:32
I started staying home with them, mainly because they had come from a traumatic
15:37
background, so it felt important to give them as much support as possible.
15:42
Also honestly, not working sounded kind of nice at that moment in time.
15:49
It turns out, though, it’s pretty miserable when you start
15:53
sitting home with your kids.
15:56
I think most parents would tell you, even if it’s just staying home with
15:59
an infant or something, you just lose yourself completely and you’re
16:05
totally thrown into mom culture.
16:08
It’s like straight mom culture everywhere.
16:10
Everything involving kids, it’s just like straight mom culture,
16:13
which is not entirely bad.
16:15
But it’s just not a place that I entirely belonged—and I still don’t really.
16:22
And then eventually Trystan pops the question of having a baby, of making
16:27
a baby, which is something that we had literally never talked about before.
16:35
As a gay man,
16:39
you just know that you’re never gonna be with a pregnant person, you know.
16:43
So your mind never even explores anything beyond that.
16:52
It was a lot of things happening in my head and learning.
16:58
And everything, from the very much things that I know that straight cis dudes might
17:04
go through, where I’m like, “what if I’m totally repulsed by this pregnant person,”
17:10
things like that, to just feeling really weird about like “what is my
17:14
role in this?” “I’ve been staying home with the kids full time.
17:19
He’s working.
17:21
What am I supposed to do?” And all of that stuff.
17:27
Not to mention, Trystan was very interested in his
17:30
pregnancy, I mean obviously.
17:35
And I really wasn’t interested.
17:36
[Laughs] So he always would just be like, “Oh, my app is saying this and this today.
17:43
And did you know, look and this is the size of Leo’s hands today.”
17:48
Anyway, it’s just like there was a lot of tiny little [inaudible]
17:51
. That’s so cute.
17:53
And so yeah, it was a really complicated, interesting experience.
17:59
But like anything, you learn that all you can do is commit to it,
18:07
commit to being genuine, and being opening, and learning and doing your
18:10
best, which is what I’m trying to do.
18:12
And then, you know, it worked out.
18:14
Trystan had a baby.
18:15
And the baby is beautiful and healthy.
18:19
That is undoubtedly the most meaningful and tense experience of my life.
18:27
The moment that Leo was born, is like the closest to God that I think I have
18:33
ever been, just being in that moment.
18:36
And when Leo came out, the room just burst into—I don’t know how
18:42
to explain it—laughter.
18:44
There’s laughter and crying, and just this burst of emotion that I’ve
18:50
never experienced in my life before.
18:54
But it was an amazing, meaningful experience.
18:56
If you are able to witness a baby be born, you should do that.
19:04
There’s just something unspoken there.
19:10
I think part of the experience was, that is an experience that queer people
19:14
have been robbed of, historically, especially in our modern culture.
19:21
When we were younger, I was told “You are a pervert. Your kids
19:26
should not be around you. You don’t have anything to do with kids.
19:29
That’s not your role.” And at some point, as gay male culture especially
19:32
embraces that, they say like, “Ok fine. So we’ll just have these parades
19:38
with naked people and go-go boys can just be a regular part of our thing.
19:42
And that’s totally right to embrace that stuff.
19:46
We should embrace sexuality more, but not at the cost of experiencing
19:52
family and children and ignoring that.
19:57
Leo will be coming at the end of class.
19:59
You all can see him.
20:05
He’s truly adorable.
20:09
He does have a scratch down his face right now.
20:11
He is like a black-eyed kid.
20:13
He scratched himself.
20:14
It was like, how did any of us survive childhood?
20:18
He went to go move something off his face and literally cut his own face.
20:22
[Laughs] He got very mad at me for it.
20:29
There’s some instances where my little brother would scratch his own face.
20:31
My mom’s like, “Looks like he got in a fight with his hand.”
20:35
I will say every major injury that Leo has gotten has not been under my supervision.
20:45
[Audience
20:49
laughs]
20:49
Anyways, so yeah!
20:51
Now Trystan does a lot of activist work, especially around trans stuff.
20:58
And trans fertility has been a lot of his work lately.
21:01
I stay home with the kids full-time still.
21:04
I do a lot of work for an organization called Beyond These
21:06
Walls where we work to support LGBT incarcerated people in Oregon.
21:12
I’m doing stuff like all new to prisons
21:16
or forming state-wide LGBT personnel coalition this year.
21:23
We’re both very much involved in a lot of activist sort of work.
21:28
We’ve been really committed to making the lives of our fellow people better.
21:36
I think we’ll always be committed to that.
21:37
I don’t know that either of us would ever be taking a job
21:40
at a corporation somewhere.
21:43
Although for the right price, I might consider that.
21:51
[Laughs]
21:51
So yeah, I stay at home with the kids full-time.
21:55
A lot of our life very much looks normal—that’s a weird word I guess.
22:00
But you know, the kids have piano lessons.
22:03
And they have these school functions that we have to tolerate.
22:09
It’s terrible, like pancake breakfasts that the school does.
22:13
So I’m very much a part of it.
22:15
You don’t have a choice but to just engage with mainstream family and parent culture.
22:21
But also, like, last week when I came home, our daughter Hailey
22:24
had dressed Leo up as a fairy.
22:27
He was wearing a little fairy costume.
22:29
He had a full face of makeup on, our hair clip.
22:32
And he was wearing perfume.
22:35
And they were practicing model poses.
22:38
And Biff is like, “Hailey has been entertaining Leo for two hours.
22:41
It’s amazing.” We
22:45
do go to drag shows.
22:47
We watch Queer Eye as a family.
22:49
They travel a lot with me when I go away for work.
22:51
So they’re seeing all my family building queer stuff all the time.
22:55
We go to Pride every year.
22:57
They also see, I think, a totally different dynamic in their parents than
23:00
they might in a heterosexual household.
23:03
So, in some ways, we’re like everybody else.
23:06
And in some ways, we’re literally nothing like
23:10
anybody else.
23:11
In our parenting, queerness comes up a lot in our parenting.
23:15
Lucas is like a bro, a straight bro.
23:18
Our 12-year old.
23:22
It’s
23:24
a really interesting challenge to feel like you’re raising one of the kids that
23:30
very much seems like the kid that bullied
23:37
you.
23:37
He’s sweet and obviously our hope is that he’s not one of those
23:41
kids, that he can learn to navigate masculinity in a positive way.
23:49
But that’s challenging.
23:52
Our daughter Hailey is very girly and feminine.
23:56
But she’s also really open about things.
24:00
She’s already saying that she is pretty sure she is not totally straight.
24:06
She’s just open.
24:07
It definitely feels easier to raise a girl for some reason.
24:11
I know that that’s probably has been not historically true for many people.
24:19
But it definitely feels easier.
24:20
Then Leo’s been great because we’ve known Leo since he came out.
24:26
So there just isn’t anything that exists there that isn’t familiar to
24:30
us like there kind of is with Lucas.
24:36
Yeah, I think that’s it.
24:38
Cool.
24:39
What do you all want to know more about?
24:43
Yes.
24:44
I remember in high school, when I was in high school, which was
24:53
2010-ish, there was a big thing about the first pregnant man, I guess.
24:58
I don’t remember what his man was.
24:59
Yeah Thomas Beatie.
25:01
And I was just wondering how that affected your decision to have a baby.
25:06
Thomas had his child about 10 years after my friend Matt Rice did, tip into scope.
25:13
Matt’s son Blake just turned 21 in November of last year.
25:18
So for 21 years at least, transgender men have been giving
25:22
birth to their own babies.
25:24
And Matt’s stories about that time are wild.
25:26
I
25:29
was in the queer and trans movement when Thomas went public
25:33
with his trans pregnancy story.
25:35
I think it was pretty upsetting because he was really monetizing being
25:39
the first when he wasn’t the first.
25:42
A lot of trans folks told him: “Bro, it’s so amazing what you’re doing, but
25:47
you’re not the first.” I think for me, as a trans person in the movement, it felt
25:53
like there was not an acknowledgement of all the work that people had done
25:56
before then which was really hard.
25:59
And also, again being in the queer movement, I did not feel that it
26:03
was the right time for someone to tell that kind of a story publicly.
26:07
I did not think that people were ready.
26:09
And he got destroyed in the media.
26:12
Destroyed.
26:14
It was incredibly painful to watch out of empathy for him.
26:17
It was incredibly painful to witness as a trans person.
26:22
So since then, I’ve really committed.
26:24
I do a lot of work with the media.
26:26
I do a lot of work approaching people to talk to the media.
26:28
I do a lot of background with media people to be like, “Say this/don’t
26:31
say this. That’s not what that means.
26:34
This is what this means,” because I want people to tell their stories
26:37
responsibly and not inadvertently trigger a backlash in the ways that he did.
26:45
And I had really thought that in ten years, maybe American culture had shifted
26:49
so I wouldn’t have the same experience.
26:52
But that was not correct.
26:54
It was a miscalculation on my part.
26:57
I thought we were a little further ahead than we actually were.
27:05
One of the weird parts about Trystan’s pregnancy, Trump was
27:09
elected when Trystan was pregnant.
27:14
Yeah.
27:15
And Trystan was just starting to show.
27:18
So the overlap of that stuff was
27:23
really weird and scary to deal with.
27:28
Pretty much as soon as he got elected.
27:31
It also means that people just felt really empowered—they still do, they felt
27:36
empowered—to come out and hate speech.
27:43
You say, in one of your marvelous story videos, that—again, repeating what you
27:53
just said in a sense that—initially you thought that to tell your story
28:01
would be a very positive thing.
28:03
And then you had that experience with the Daily Mail.
28:06
Was that, that’s at UK?
28:09
Yeah the Daily Mail, which I’m sure everyone in this room
28:11
knows, is a UK-based tabloid.
28:14
It has over a million independent viewers per day.
28:18
So it is the biggest tabloid in the world.
28:20
But
28:22
then you got real blowback from that.
28:24
Is that correct?
28:26
Yeah.
28:27
And you hadn’t decided at that point, “are we really going to keep
28:32
showing our family in the public.”
28:34
Yeah.
28:35
I had really thought it wasn’t going to go that way—
28:39
Yeah.
28:39
—which, I mean, was shocking to Biff.
28:42
I remember specifically there was a moment where I just had a huge meltdown.
28:46
And Biff was just like, “Sweetheart, how did you think this was gonna
28:50
go? What did you think was going to happen? When we told our story
28:55
publicly, this is what I thought we were agreeing to.” And I was not in that.
29:00
I was off in some kind of rainbows and fairy land—that’s where I live.
29:04
So
29:06
it was really, really hard.
29:08
I’m very good friends with the man who leads the trans-messaging project
29:12
at GLAAD which does all the media and messaging work in the country.
29:15
And I do work with him very closely throughout my story.
29:18
And I called him, just sobbing.
29:21
I was like, “Look at these comments. I made it worse for trans people.” And
29:27
he lovingly reminded me that I did not invent transphobia, which I appreciated,
29:36
and that trans people already know that transphobia exists.
29:39
And it’s not my job to try and protect them from that, because
29:42
we already know it exists.
29:44
And
29:47
he encouraged me to keep telling my story as I did then so that things
29:50
didn’t just go down that weird 4chan pipeline, but they kind of
29:54
stayed in a more positive space.
29:57
I asked Daily Mail to change the language of the story but
30:00
I did not hear back from them.
30:03
Yeah they suck.
30:05
Yes, Ray.
30:07
In my experience, I had received a lot of hate from the gay community—the times that
30:20
I have been in dating apps, Grinder—and a lot of fetishizing.
30:24
And I just wanted to ask you how did you navigate that, cuz I’m just
30:29
in and out all the time, like bi.
30:33
How did you navigate that, overcome it, all that stuff?
30:38
I think a couple of things.
30:39
Number one, I came out and started dating in the gay male world before
30:43
apps—I know, the dinosaur would just take the messages between each person.
30:50
[Laughs] But we did have dating websites.
30:53
So I think this draw of immediacy and “50 feet away” wasn’t there.
30:58
And then also I have learned, through working at the task force, how to
31:03
message things, how to talk about thing.
31:06
So, on all my profiles, it was like, “I am a transgender man. That means
31:11
that I was born with—and still have—a vagina. I’m interested in blah blah blah.
31:17
I’m not interested in blah blah blah.” And that way they could
31:20
have their own reaction to that news very far away from me.
31:24
And I don’t ever have to see it.
31:27
And even then, right before we got together, that was just when
31:31
some of the apps were starting.
31:32
Grinder just started.
31:34
And there was still, like, Adam for Adam, and all these other ones which
31:37
I got kicked off of for being trans.
31:39
But that just started.
31:42
And that was similarly—I was just so clear this is what I am.
31:49
If you’re interested in that, cool let’s talk.
31:51
If you’re not, bye-bye.
31:54
And also, I just developed a very high level of resiliency.
31:58
My job at the task force, for the last four years, was to go door to door and
32:01
find people in an area where they’re voting on something queer—I’m looking
32:06
for people who say they’re homophobic or transphobic—and then changing their mind.
32:10
That was my job.
32:12
Now they call it deep canvassing.
32:14
But it’s basically long-form persuasion work through one-on-one conversation,
32:19
and then teaching teams of people to do that, and then teaching teams of people
32:21
to teach teams of people to do that.
32:22
That was my job.
32:25
When you’ve had 800 strangers tell you that they think who you are is bad and
32:31
wrong, and you’ve trained yourself how to stay present with them through that
32:35
and to help them get to the heart of where that comes from and then try to
32:38
do the work that changes their mind.
32:40
Like, some dude on the internet being like “Yo that’s gross” that can’t touch me.
32:44
You know what I mean?
32:45
Just block that guy.
32:46
The other thing is, gay male culture, to its credit, has a very open line of
32:53
communication about sex and hooking up.
32:58
I have not been on a dating app or hooked up with somebody very recently.
33:06
But you know
33:09
what you’re gonna do before you meet up with them.
33:12
You’d plan out everything from are you gonna top, are you willing to this
33:16
sort of thing or that sort of thing.
33:18
And that’s something you can use to your benefit because gay men really
33:21
do talk about what’s gonna happen.
33:24
I had girl friends all the time that would be like, “I don’t know if we’re gonna
33:27
have sex tonight.” And I would be like,
33:32
“What?
33:32
Why don’t you ask?” [Laughs] Because whenever I would hook up with somebody, we
33:37
talk in detail about what we were willing and not willing to do, what our boundaries
33:40
were, if we were to use protection or not, you’d say that right away.
33:45
And I assume that it’s very similar still.
33:48
So you can use that to your advantage, because gay men are willing to talk
33:52
in detail about things beforehand.
33:55
But they’re still going to be ignorant.
33:57
But if you’re not used to that kind of a culture, some dude’d be like “yo
34:01
I’m not into that,” if it’s hitting a trauma for you, if it’s hitting a
34:05
point of sensitivity for you, you’re gonna be like “Oh my god, he thinks
34:07
I’m disgusting.” He didn’t say that.
34:08
But it’s part of gay male culture.
34:10
They will message you and be like, “how close are you”, “what are you into”.
34:14
If it’s not a match, they’ll be like “cool, bye.” Right?
34:16
And they’re not offended.
34:17
It’s part of the culture.
34:19
And in fact, that was a cultural difference between Biff and I when
34:22
we first started being intimate.
34:24
It was just like, Biff was from this world where they’re like “you do
34:27
like this”, “you don’t like this”.
34:28
I’m not necessarily from that world.
34:31
And it’s much harder for me to say “I don’t like this” or “I do like
34:33
this.” Something you have to learn.
34:38
Gay men will say like, “No offense.
34:41
If you’re feminine, I don’t bother hooking up with you.”
34:43
“If you’re short, I won’t hook up with you.” “If you’re tall,
34:46
I won’t hook up with you.”
34:46
“If you’re this or that race…” It’s all over the place.
34:50
And the communication part is good.
34:53
Y’all, before you hook up with somebody, you should talk about what you feel
34:56
like you’re comfortable doing or not.
34:59
You should talk about whether or not you’re use protection or not.
35:02
That should be decisions made in the moment.
35:06
It should all be talked about.
35:07
But, it shouldn’t also mean match with ignorant—
35:12
Offensive comments.
35:13
—no fats, no femmes.
35:18
The fact that I have to out myself in these type of environments—here’s a
35:23
double view, I guess, if I don’t out myself and I’m outed at that point,
35:30
it can lead some violent experiences.
35:33
I came out when Boys Don’t Cry was released.
35:37
And Boys Don’t Cry, right, it’s about a hate crime against a trans guy.
35:39
So I’m not messing with coming out to someone on a date.
35:42
No.
35:43
No.
35:43
So
35:45
that’s my cultural context I want you to know, way ahead of time.
35:51
And I’ve just always accepted that if you have a body that’s
35:55
different than what they’re expecting, you should just tell them.
35:58
And I know that that’s not your generation.
36:00
“Well, it’s on them for assuming.” Fine.
36:03
But does that help you get a date?
36:05
And does that help you not have a date that goes bad?
36:07
That’s all I cared about.
36:09
If we’re not talking about apps like this, if we’re talking about, I don’t know,
36:14
you go to a party, blah blah blah, things happen, when do you have to out yourself?
36:20
Cuz for me, with girls it’s way, way easier, it’s way safer.
36:25
With boys, I feel like I’m in danger 100% of the time.
36:29
So that’s one of the reasons why in the past, I’ve used these apps
36:35
instead of trying to meet men right on, cuz it’s way more safe for me.
36:41
And I’ve experienced these aggressions and these hate crimes
36:45
basically when I didn’t out myself.
36:50
But if I don’t out myself, this happens.
36:52
And if I out myself, I just face rejection and hate.
36:56
So it’s wonderful being trans.
37:01
Yeah, I had lots of negative experiences.
37:04
And then I had lots of positive experiences.
37:08
If it wasn’t for bi-dudes, I would’ve been screwed.
37:11
[Audience
37:16
laughs] I would’ve been SOL.
37:17
So it’s also about filtering by only dudes who had said that they were bi.
37:22
Honestly.
37:24
Pro-tip.
37:24
You
37:29
were
37:31
discussing being a part of gay male culture, but now
37:33
you’re going by they/them.
37:34
How does where you are as your general gender fits in with that
37:41
kind of assumption of sexuality?
37:44
There’s two parts.
37:45
There’s parts of our identity.
37:46
But there’s the way that we’re perceived by the world.
37:50
And then there’s the way that we feel and interact with the world from the inside.
37:56
I am perceived by the world as a gay male.
37:59
I understand that.
38:00
That’s no mystery to me.
38:02
And it’s aggravating when there are people who are non-binary, which
38:06
is what I am, they can’t seem to understand or accept that part of it.
38:12
They’re like, “I move through the world with cis-male privilege.”
38:20
It’s just one of those things where I feel like as long as my gender presentation
38:23
stays like this, I can’t separate myself.
38:27
In fact, I think it’s disingenuous to separate myself from taking
38:32
responsibility for gay male culture, or being involved or connected to that.
38:38
So for me, I’ve always been somebody who, I think, is gender-open.
38:49
There’s been times in my life, as a teenager, I was very
38:53
feminine, often mistaken for a
38:57
transwoman.
38:58
I would wear lots of makeup and shop exclusively at
39:01
Forever 21, still do sometimes.
39:08
My experience or exploration of gender my whole like has always been in the context
39:13
of being a gay man and then exploring femininity and trying to figure out
39:19
that part of it.
39:20
And then it’s been the recent years that I went through this whole
39:23
thing and I’m like, “I’m non-binary.
39:25
I know that.” Because the truth is, if you put me in a circle of women, I honestly
39:33
don’t feel super comfortable, but the same is true if you put me in a circle of men.
39:38
So that brought me to this place where I’m like, “Yeah, that’s how I am.”
39:41
Then, for a while, I felt like there’s such an emphasis on pronouns
39:46
and the pronouns people use for you.
39:47
I understand why that’s important for a lot of people.
39:50
It never has felt important to me—still doesn’t feel important to me.
39:55
Maybe that’s because I carry the various privileges that I do.
40:00
But I was always like, “Well, if I don’t care enough to ask people to
40:04
call me they/them, maybe I’m not really non-binary.” “If I don’t want all
40:11
this pronouns stuff, that must mean
40:15
it’s not that big of a deal for me.”
40:18
And then I came to this place where I was like, “Wait a minute.
40:21
That’s a really problematic way to look at identity,” because part of
40:27
my identity that I often neglected in my life is how actually feel or how
40:31
I’m actually feeling, and not about how I’m always perceived or taken.
40:36
So,
40:39
things have changed.
40:40
The truth was, as a feminine person, feminine man, I was very much in
40:44
the minority when I was younger.
40:46
Things have just changed.
40:47
I meet guys now that are more feminine than I am that are straight.
40:53
Things are just different now.
40:55
So I use they/them.
40:56
And I really don’t care if somebody doesn’t call me they or them sometime.
40:59
You’ll hear Trystan say “he” or “him, people will say “he.” Sometimes—and
41:05
this is no joke—I am misgendered.
41:08
People will say “ma’am” or “she.” That’s fine too.
41:12
I honestly don’t care.
41:14
It’s like kind of amusing when it happens because then people
41:16
feel, like, embarrassed about it.
41:19
And it’s fun to just sit with them in their uncomfortable feelings.
41:24
So yeah.
41:26
There are people, though, that are nonbinary and really feel
41:29
strongly that they don’t want those gender pronouns on them.
41:33
And that’s fair.
41:34
That’s a totally fair way to approach it.
41:37
But more and gay men, I think, are embracing that idea that sometime
41:43
being really feminine or embracing the more feminine qualities, or just being
41:48
effeminate—sometimes it does mean that your gender is either more fluid, or
41:54
more towards the middle of a spectrum, or maybe just not even on the spectrum.
42:00
I think I almost use exclusively them/them at home.
42:03
But then I worry about outing you in public sometimes so
42:10
I don’t—
42:11
Yeah.
42:12
I mean, Trystan has started to say they/them to the kids when
42:15
talking about me and stuff like that, which I do appreciate.
42:18
It feels better.
42:19
At the same time, I honestly—just like a lot of other people—I don’t know if
42:25
anybody here uses a pronoun different than the one you were assigned at birth.
42:28
I know some of you do.
42:31
But there is labor in asking people to use the right pronoun.
42:38
Every time somebody does it, you have to go through this thing where
42:42
you’re like, “Ok, do I say something?
42:43
And if I say something and they’re not open to this, it’s just so
42:47
much emotional labor that, to be honest with you, at this point in my
42:49
life, I’m not willing to deal with.
42:51
I would rather just have anybody call me what they want because I don’t have the
42:55
emotional energy to put towards that.
42:57
We’re old and tired.
42:58
I mean, I have kids, three kids.
43:02
And it’s not like that isn’t important.
43:04
It’s totally important.
43:05
But I’m gonna let, maybe, the other people that have the energy focus
43:10
on that stuff, fight those battles.
43:12
[Laughs]
43:18
But it takes a lot of energy to tell people all the time.
43:24
Sorry if this question is too personal.
43:28
You remembered when you were going on hormones, how the doctor had said your
43:33
uterus basically is going to be unusable.
43:37
Was he just plain wrong, or were there extra steps that
43:40
you’ve had to take to have Leo?
43:42
Yeah, it was a common misconception—and still is—that
43:46
testosterone causes sterility.
43:48
There’s actually never been any evidence to show that
43:51
testosterone causes sterility.
43:53
In fact, all of the evidence is to the contrary.
43:55
A brand-new study just came out in November of last year, it’s an eight-year
43:59
retrospective study at the Boston IVF where they looked at the medical chart.
44:03
It was the best kind of study, right?
44:05
They were not asking someone to tell them what happened.
44:08
They’re like “Yo, let’s just look at the data.” They looked at eight years
44:12
of collecting eggs from transgender men for IVF purposes, either for them
44:19
to have an embryo implanted in them or their partner, or their surrogate.
44:23
The egg harvesting—this is getting super nerdy—basically the quality and quantity
44:28
of the eggs that they harvested from transgender men were the exact same as
44:32
cisgender women who share their other demographic identities, like same age.
44:37
So it is now concrete proof of what we’ve been saying for a long time, which is a
44:43
little bit like, your uterus is an egg processing plant and it just shuts down if
44:49
you’re taking testosterone the right way.
44:51
You can ovulate when you’re on testosterone.
44:53
It’s rare.
44:54
If you’re taking it the way you’re supposed to be, you shouldn’t.
44:57
But the processing plant just shuts down.
45:00
And then when you go off of your testosterone, same as from birth
45:03
control, it just starts back up again.
45:05
And it starts maturing eggs and kicking them out of your
45:08
fallopian tubes for possible—
45:12
We got pregnant before we knew that we could.
45:15
We had made the decision for Trystan to go off hormones so
45:19
that we could try to make a baby.
45:21
But then all of a sudden, Trystan was like, “Well, I’m pregnant.” And
45:25
we thought we had a good six months still to think about or plan that.
45:30
The data shows that your cycle returns three to six months after
45:35
you stop taking testosterone.
45:36
And that your rates of conception are the same as anybody else
45:39
once your cycle is back.
45:40
But I apparently slept through 7th grade biology because I didn’t realize
45:43
you ovulate before you menstruate.
45:45
So I was fertile before I knew I was fertile.
45:48
And then I was pregnant.
45:52
I didn’t know [inaudible]
45:54
Well, now a lot of the work that I do is fertility education.
45:56
So now I’m like, “Here are the fallopian tubes and the egg comes down.
46:00
And it’s on alternate sides.” All kinds of weird shit that I know about now.
46:07
But yeah.
46:08
So there were extra steps which is just stop taking testosterone.
46:12
That’s it.
46:12
But I still hear from trans folks all the time whose doctors are
46:14
telling them testosterone will cause infertility, which is not true.
46:18
But estrogen, though, does affect—would affect, if they’re
46:24
somebody that were taking estrogen.
46:25
Sure.
46:26
So what we know right now about the way that HRT, estrogen-based hormone therapy,
46:32
what we know right now is nothing.
46:34
There has never been a single study on transgender women and fertility.
46:38
It was an article written last year that was a case study.
46:42
Guess how many transwomen they were looking at in the study?
46:45
Two.
46:46
[Audience gasps]
46:49
I’m not a scientist.
46:50
But that doesn’t seem to me like useful statistics.
46:55
So, what we know right now anecdotally is it seems to be completely random,
47:00
that it seems for some transgender women, they can be on estrogen-based
47:04
hormones for ten years, stop taking them, and knock up their partner right away.
47:08
Other people can be on estrogen-based hormones for one month and
47:13
they’re permanently sterile.
47:15
And from reproductive justice aspect—this is the number one thing that keeps
47:20
me up at night—is transgender women infertility, that we know nothing about
47:25
what hormones are doing to transwomen in terms of their reproductive ability.
47:30
And that really pisses me off.
47:32
I have a whole Google Drive folder on research on trans-fertility.
47:36
There’s 42 studies on transgender men.
47:39
There’s this one article with two transwomen in it from last year.
47:44
So that’s the thing that I push for the most when I’m in front
47:46
of researchers: transwomen.
47:51
So back to testosterone, my
47:55
favorite, I was also told—I was not told by my doctor, but before I was like, “Ok,
48:01
I’m gonna become sterile.” I didn’t care cuz I don’t have any plans of children.
48:07
Beard juice.
48:07
Yeah, beard juice,
48:13
basically.
48:14
And this is extremely transphobic because they pretty much don’t want
48:17
us produce and have little humans.
48:20
That’s how I perceive it.
48:22
They tell us that we’re sterile forever and we can’t have
48:26
kids or whatever that is.
48:30
And same with transwomen.
48:34
They give us all this false information so we can’t reproduce.
48:38
And I actually remember—I don’t know if this is, here, the same, but—in Spain,
48:43
they offer you to take out the whole thing, the whole ovaries and all that.
48:49
Hysterectomy.
48:50
Yeah, hysterectomy, cuz technically testosterone fucks with it.
48:56
In fact, I went back to Spain this summer and I got it all checked up.
48:59
And they told me that they have to give me the hysterectomy.
49:03
So they offered it.
49:05
Cuz if not, cancer and all these overused stuff.
49:09
Never showed any evidence.
49:09
So that’s extremely transphobic.
49:11
And if I didn’t know that this was super transphobic, I would have done it.
49:14
Cuz right now, it’s just like, yeah sometimes it does weird things,
49:19
so in case, just get rid of it.
49:21
And it was so unfair.
49:25
And trans-kids that are extremely dysphoric or
49:30
just don’t have information, they’re gonna go under those surgeries and get rid of
49:35
stuff that they might want in the future.
49:37
And y’all are studying history.
49:38
You know our country doesn’t have a great track record of deciding who
49:42
shouldn’t and should have babies.
49:45
And in many countries around the world, in order to transition legally,
49:48
you have to have a hysterectomy, you have to—in some other way, maybe
49:52
surgically—sterile before they will even let you change your paperwork.
49:56
And in some countries, transgender men have had babies, and then the
49:58
government has changed all their gender documents back to their original one.
50:04
They have to be legally female in order to give birth.
50:10
There’s also this narrative that to be trans means to hate your body.
50:16
I think a lot of people make the assumption that if you’re a
50:21
transman, having a baby would be a traumatic awful experience, that it’s
50:24
something you’d never want to do.
50:27
The more that we view things through this binary, the more assumptions
50:31
we make that are just wrong.
50:32
There’re lots of trans-people that have no interest in
50:35
altering their body in any way.
50:38
And that is a version of trans that exists.
50:41
But if you don’t know it exists, then you don’t know that’s an option for you.
50:46
And then you get pushed into things like that.
50:49
The data shows that about 50 to 70% of trans-adults wished that
50:52
they had preserved their fertility pre-transition, because the rates
50:56
of desire for kids are the same for trans-people as other LGBT people.
51:00
And those are almost the same as their cis-gender or heterosexual counterpart.
51:03
It’s not quite, but almost.
51:05
So yeah, it sucks.
51:07
I have
51:10
a question for “what would you do.” I’m sure you guys know who Ben Shapiro is.
51:18
And
51:22
I came from a town where confederate flags are shown as a thing,
51:30
you don’t openly show your gayness so you’re a cool gay—things like that.
51:35
So a lot of people bring up the Ben Shapiro argument.
51:38
How do you go about that on educating them?
51:45
What do you do in that situation?
51:47
Yeah man.
51:48
I spent many years doing this exact work.
51:52
I don’t really know who Ben Shapiro is—some high-schooler asked me that too, I
51:54
don’t know—but I assume he’s a transphobe.
51:55
The important thing to know the way that the psychology of that bias
52:02
works—is that we go through stages.
52:04
This actually comes from the anti-racism movement.
52:06
So, that’s where most of my background and training is in, is doing
52:09
anti-racism work with white people.
52:11
And the way that our brains perceive difference, it’s in stages.
52:14
So people who’re in the Ben Shapiro’s super transphobic
52:17
land, I’m never gonna reach them.
52:20
Psychologically the way that bias works, they need to hear
52:23
from someone who is like them.
52:27
I couldn’t talk to them compassionately, not yell at them
52:29
in the face—they ain’t gonna change.
52:30
It’s just not how bias works.
52:33
I’ve just sort of spiritually, or psychically, let go of those
52:37
people because it’s gonna waste my time and maybe hurt my feelings.
52:40
And they may even actually get more transphobic at the end of
52:45
our conversation because of how far away we are from each other.
52:49
For people like that, they really need to hear from people who are like them.
52:52
They need to hear from other old white dudes, like a pastor
52:57
or someone who can reach them.
52:59
Honestly, elected officials who have been conservative but having a kid
53:03
come out as gay, they’ve done a lot of work in changing people’s minds.
53:07
I just sort of let those people go.
53:10
It’s the people that are one step closer than them, that’s who I can reach.
53:13
People who’re like, “Ok, I don’t think it’s gross and bad and wrong, but I
53:16
don’t get it.” Yes, I am here for you.
53:23
You just can’t win everyone.
53:24
And there’s a huge portion of population—in fact, it’s probably the
53:29
bigger portion of the population—are people that are like, “I support you
53:33
but I don’t want to know what happens in your bedroom.” Something like that.
53:36
[Audience agrees]
53:36
Those are my people.
53:37
Ok, this is a good place that we can have a conversation
53:40
about why that’s problematic.
53:43
Yeah, those are my people.
53:45
That middle section, those are the people who’re mostly likely to be
53:49
moved to action and move to support.
53:51
And to me, that’s the parents of trans-people, that’s the bosses
53:54
of trans-people, that’s the people writing articles about trans-people.
53:57
Those are people who can really shift and change culture and also lived experiences,
54:01
I mean the differences between their kid getting kicked out or not.
54:04
So that’re the people that I like.
54:08
What’re your guys’ identities with parenthood?
54:11
I have a nine-year-old brother.
54:12
And my mom is very extremely straight, she’s a little homophobic.
54:17
How do you break down, when your kids come to you from school and they’re like,
54:20
“Something happened. This happened.” How do you break it down for their
54:23
minds to understand, without scaring them, like, making them more confused?
54:29
The interesting thing is that we tend to have this idea that things
54:35
are so complicated for kids.
54:36
The truth is things are so simple in their mind and world.
54:40
It really is a matter of just being like, “Some men have uteruses,
54:47
some men don’t have uteruses.
54:49
And daddy is a man that has a uterus.
54:52
And that’s how he’s gonna have a baby.” And they’re just like, “Ok, yeah.”
54:57
And then they have these conversations with their friends. And for the most
55:00
part, their friends are like, “Okay.”
55:08
There are conversations that we have to have that’ll definitely go
55:11
to that next level of complicated.
55:13
It happens way more with Lucas around rape culture.
55:18
And he changed his name.
55:21
The reason he changed his name, initially, was that the name that
55:26
he was given was a girl’s name.
55:28
Because a girl in his class named Riley and his name used to be Riley.
55:32
And he was like, “Oh my god, Riley’s a girl name.
55:34
I don’t want that.”
55:34
Yeah he’s like, “I can’t be called Riley.” So we had to be like, “Ok,
55:39
you can totally change your name—
55:41
—but this is really sexist.”
55:42
But
55:46
Dan Savage also has a good principle that he says, like “When your kids ask
55:50
you something, they’re ready to know that thing.” If they’re in a place where
55:53
they’re asking you, it’s ok to give them the answer. And our kids, for the
56:00
most part, them and their friends—Hailey has a best friend that’s non-binary.
56:05
Who’s nine.
56:06
Nine-year-old kid.
56:08
Nobody really—It’s just a lot different, I think, for kids right now.
56:15
That’s not true everywhere though.
56:17
Yeah.
56:17
I’m trying to teach him to be more open to things.
56:20
Cuz he grew up with me and my mom, so he doesn’t have a
56:23
father figure, anyone in that.
56:26
It’s all been women.
56:27
All my mom’s single friends, they all group together and talk about
56:31
how their kids are horrible.
56:33
So
56:36
it’s really hard for me to be like, “You don’t have to act this way to fit in at
56:40
school.” He won’t wear certain colors cuz he knows he’s gonna get picked on.
56:46
There’s once when I put a hat on him, and I was like “This hat looks really
56:49
cute.” And he goes: “No.” But now he uses “pretty.” He’s like “That’s so
56:55
pretty.” So I’m trying to get him to be comfortable, not being ashamed of
56:59
using feminine things and assuming that only girls can use that stuff.
57:04
But it is hard, cuz I only see him a couple times a month.
57:08
So I come home and I’m like, “Forget everything mom has accidentally
57:11
taught you. This is what you need to know to survive this world.”
57:15
Also try to give him examples.
57:16
Show him grown men that are showing different expressions of gender.
57:27
When I work with high-schoolers, we talk about The Rock a lot cuz The Rock is
57:31
the like dudeliest dude that ever duded.
57:34
And he’s also a rad-ass feminist.
57:36
He’s super gentle and kind.
57:42
I never talk about toxic masculinity, I only talk about positive masculinity,
57:45
like “don’t tell me what not to do but tell me what to do.” So I think those
57:49
kinds of examples are always great.
57:51
I
57:54
wanted to ask how you handle the teachers.
57:57
Cuz I have a friend who’s a teacher, and they are out in their identity.
58:01
And they were wearing a button.
58:03
And one of the kids in their class asked about it.
58:05
So they answered the question very thoroughly, not talking about anything
58:09
explicitly sexual or anything—cuz that’s not okay in the classroom environment.
58:14
They are middle-schoolers.
58:15
So they answered the question pretty thoroughly, like
58:18
“Well, this is what this is.
58:19
This is what I am.
58:19
These are the other different things.” And the principal came up to them a few
58:25
days later, and was like “You cannot do that.” Because the other parents
58:29
and the other teachers said it was inappropriate for a classroom environment.
58:33
And basically threatened my friend with being fired if they even thought
58:37
about talking about this subject again.
58:40
So how do you navigate that minefield?
58:42
Cuz kids are pretty much like Play-Doh, but the parents and
58:47
the other teachers are all always super set in their ways, it seems.
58:52
I mean, for us, we’re in the Portland public school district.
58:55
We are the only queer family in the whole school.
58:59
And teachers are falling all over themselves to try and be supportive, the
59:05
other parents even.
59:08
One time, one of the neighbor kids said something like our
59:11
house was silly or something.
59:12
And I mentioned it to his mom.
59:13
And she’s like “Oh my god, did he say it because you guys
59:15
are gay?” And I was like, “No.
59:18
He says cuz we don’t have a TV in our living room.”
59:23
They just really go for it.
59:25
There is
59:29
an amount of privilege wrapped up in this.
59:31
But there is a portion of life in modern society today that’s really lovely where
59:36
it’s like the opposite of discrimination.
59:40
Like, we will take a flight with Leo and they’re like “Would you want your own row?
59:46
We’ll give you your own row.” Whatever they can to do not
59:49
seem homophobic, they wanna do.
59:51
And we’re gonna ride that wave!
59:56
Totally.
59:56
We’re like, “Yes. We have two rows
1:00:02
please.”
1:00:02
[Audience laughs]
1:00:03
I mean, I’ve been tokenized into a lot of places I have no fucking right to be in.
1:00:07
But they were like, “We need a trans-person.” And I was like, “I’m
1:00:09
your man!” Because I know that there are so many doors that have been slammed
1:00:13
in my face because people are like “We don’t want a trans-person here.
1:00:16
He’s going to always point out what’s wrong.
1:00:18
He’s going to cancel us on Twitter.
1:00:20
Blah blah blah.” So I feel like any opportunity that I have, I’m
1:00:23
going to make the most of it.
1:00:25
And that’s how I’ve gotten into the leadership positions I’m in today.
1:00:28
It’s cuz I snuck my way into these places where I learn things that
1:00:31
I didn’t really have a right to but they wanted to check that box.
1:00:35
Ok, I don’t care.
1:00:39
Yeah we just end up having that weird thing.
1:00:42
But keeping in mind that people are not as normative in their
1:00:45
presentations, people who maybe are not traditionally attractive,
1:00:49
people of color, don’t get that same—
1:00:53
People living in poverty, certainly,
1:00:55
—don’t get that same treatment that happened.
1:00:58
It just so happens that we do often get that.
1:01:02
We have to really be upset about something to complain.
1:01:06
But if we do complain, they really take it seriously.
1:01:12
And I’m just like, “I just wanted a fork.” [Laughs]
1:01:15
They fire the person that just brings the fork.
1:01:19
[Laughs]
1:01:20
It could also be a little bit, we have pretty advanced resiliency
1:01:23
skills and advocacy skills.
1:01:24
So if something does go wrong, we do feel pretty peaceful about
1:01:28
saying “Hey, this thing is happening and we don’t like it.” So yeah.
1:01:36
What age did you, both Lucas and Hailey, right—that’s the name—come live with you?
1:01:43
What were their ages?
1:01:44
They were one and three.
1:01:45
One and three.
1:01:47
I’m just in a developmental psych class right now, like a human lifespan one.
1:01:51
So it’s really interesting.
1:01:52
Yeah, turns out the first three years of your life are super important.
1:01:57
We really hope, since we got them when they were so little, that Lucas
1:02:00
maybe wouldn’t have any memories or that there wouldn’t be any
1:02:02
lasting impacts of his life before.
1:02:05
And it is a constant—I would say even more than daily, like hourly
1:02:11
—challenge to support him and to show him patience and grace.
1:02:14
He’s
1:02:16
hopelessly
1:02:23
insecure.
1:02:25
Profoundly, chronically sad, and insecure.
1:02:27
And everyone, all these therapists are like “Yeah.
1:02:30
Kids that are neglected, they may always have a hole there that
1:02:33
nothing can fill.” It’s rough.
1:02:37
Yeah.
1:02:41
I was curious, because you talked about the Daily Mail and the tabloids
1:02:45
and how there was just essentially a media circus that happened around
1:02:51
you being pregnant and everything.
1:02:52
I’m just curious about how you parented though that, cuz there was
1:02:57
so much public attention happening and you guys still taught all the time.
1:03:01
Just how parenting pretty young children around that sort of environment
1:03:08
where there’s a ton of hate speech coming in and what that’s like.
1:03:10
I’m
1:03:13
from Portland too, so I don’t know how much of that necessarily will be coming
1:03:17
directly from communities that they will be in because Portland, in certain
1:03:22
areas, can be really understanding.
1:03:24
I’m just curious what that experience was like.
1:03:29
I mean, we blocked everything from them, from coming to them.
1:03:35
And there was nothing in person that was negative.
1:03:37
It was truly the opposite.
1:03:38
Yes, everyone knew our story.
1:03:39
But it meant that when we’re in line at Starbucks, the barista was like, “Oh
1:03:44
my god, congratulations! Free coffees for everyone!” It was like an antidote.
1:03:51
It was like the anti-troll, that we’re getting this incredible in-person support.
1:03:57
So we’ve just blocked them from all of it.
1:03:59
I would say two other things.
1:04:00
One is I’m still digging out, from under the emotional bubble, of having sustained
1:04:06
that long and that intense and onslaught of hate speech for that period of time.
1:04:13
So I think that impacted my parenting in some ways.
1:04:15
I’m just not able to always be as present, and as positive and as
1:04:18
patient with them as I wanted to be.
1:04:22
I think the second thing would be—I think it was six months
1:04:24
ago, Hailey and I were on a trip.
1:04:26
Then, she asked me: “Did people say mean things to you, or about you, when
1:04:32
you were pregnant?” And I said: “Yeah, they did.” And then she started crying.
1:04:37
And I was like, “Oh no, I’ve gotten too far.” Hailey and I are very
1:04:41
emotional, open people. And she said: “Well, what did they say?”
1:04:44
And I was like, “Oh, sweetheart.
1:04:46
I’m not going to share that with you, cuz you’re just too little.” And she
1:04:46
was like, “I’m not too little. I’m
1:04:53
big.
1:04:53
I’m almost ten.” But I just said that I care a lot about her spirit and I was
1:04:57
worried that it would hurt her spirit.
1:04:59
So that was enough.
1:05:00
So, they know that we had something.
1:05:03
Another aspect about our parenting is that we are very restrictive with
1:05:07
technology, or we traditionally have been.
1:05:11
We do not have a TV.
1:05:14
We don’t have a TV on, things that are watched or—
1:05:18
The kids don’t have a phone.
1:05:19
Not everybody has a phone yet, which they’re up in arms about.
1:05:24
These are porn studios in your pocket.
1:05:28
How do parents not know
1:05:33
this?
1:05:33
They’re so young, 12.
1:05:35
Most of the kids in Hailey’s class have a phone.
1:05:36
I didn’t get a phone till I was 15 and it was for emergencies.
1:05:40
And it was like a Blackberry-looking phone.
1:05:42
Did you look at porn on it?
1:05:43
No.
1:05:43
Exactly.
1:05:46
Yes, it’s horrible.
1:05:47
I’d just text my mom, like, “I’m going to lunch.”
1:05:50
So anyway, they don’t have access to any of that stuff.
1:05:54
So y’all are about my age.
1:05:57
And I know that at my school—I was in, I call it “so-lame”—Salem, there should
1:06:06
have been support. But I had to basically kick and scream of every single other
1:06:09
queer kid in my school to try and just open the PFLAG chapter at my school. Was
1:06:15
there some kind of similar thing where
1:06:18
in the dark days when people don’t even have words for half
1:06:21
of what we is in this room?
1:06:25
What were some of the efforts at that time when you were trying to
1:06:29
just express some aspect of yourself that you just got kiboshed real hard?
1:06:34
We tried to have a GSA at my high school and we were told
1:06:36
“no” by the assistant principal.
1:06:38
GSA?
1:06:41
Gay–Straight Alliance, GSA.
1:06:44
I think it’s called Gender-Sexuality Alliance.
1:06:46
It was called Gay-Straight Alliance back then.
1:06:50
[Audience agrees]
1:06:51
Yeah, we’re talking in this time.
1:06:53
And this is in school?
1:06:54
Yeah, 1998.
1:06:57
And we were told “no” by the vice principal who was Mormon.
1:06:59
And then after I left, he was actually arrested for having a
1:07:05
relationship with a male student,
1:07:08
which explains a lot.
1:07:11
So I was like, “Oh, that’s why that dude was so fucking weird and homophobic.”
1:07:19
So yeah, any attempt at support that I try to get at that early
1:07:22
age. I went into theatre when I was a kid and that saved my life.”
1:07:26
Yeah, truly.
1:07:27
What about you?
1:07:32
My survival mechanism as a young person was to fly under the radar, kind of.
1:07:37
Because I was very—I wore makeup, I wore girl’s clothes.
1:07:41
I was not under the radar in that way.
1:07:44
But I just decided that I’m not here to make waves, I’m
1:07:48
not here to try to do anything.
1:07:51
I’m here to prove to you that I deserve to be here and that’s all I wanted to do.
1:07:56
I think for a long time, that’s where I came from.
1:08:00
But you know,
1:08:06
I make waves professionally often times.
1:08:09
[Laughs] And it’s always around gender stuff.
1:08:14
There’s big dress code issues at my work when I worked in
1:08:18
homelessness in Los Angeles.
1:08:19
And I would just be like, “If I were a woman wearing this,
1:08:24
would you be approaching me about not being professional
1:08:27
enough?” And the answer is “no”.
1:08:30
Because they’re basically wearing what I’m wearing.
1:08:34
Because I used to wear really low-cut things, or things that
1:08:37
were definitely more low-cut than a man would traditionally wear.
1:08:41
So
1:08:43
anyway, I’ve always been shut down in those ways.
1:08:46
Professionalism is a big way that
1:08:52
queer people are silenced in the workplace.
1:08:56
It’s also where people of color are silenced in the workplace and pushed out.
1:09:00
It’s also where poor people are silenced in the workplace and pushed out, as
1:09:04
we create these standards, that are arbitrary standards, very gendered.
1:09:09
So, that’s where I’ve always been shut down.
1:09:15
Even now.
1:09:16
I have to go into a prison on regular basis, and that’s always
1:09:20
really hard cuz they have—
1:09:22
Extremely strict rules about what you can and can’t wear, colors.
1:09:26
So it’s a constant bell of learning when to compromise and when to fight.
1:09:32
But I usually am on the side of fight, so.
1:09:36
Changed a little since you’re a kid?
1:09:37
Yeah.
1:09:38
Good.
1:09:38
That makes sense.
1:09:39
In my high school, we had a Gay-Straight Alliance.
1:09:42
But it was so small.
1:09:43
And I didn’t know about it till my senior year.
1:09:45
I was like, “It’s too late. I have two months left.” But most of the kids
1:09:50
I hung out with were all LGBT kids.
1:09:52
And we were in theatre, and debate and radio.
1:09:54
So the places you could be the loudest, that’s where all of them went.
1:09:57
We were all spread out and then we came together.
1:09:59
And I was like, “We should have picked this up a lot
1:10:02
faster with our personalities.”
1:10:05
Yeah.
1:10:07
Anything else?
1:10:09
This is kind of off topic—but what would you say is the key to working
1:10:16
through adversity in a relationship and being a good partner and whatnot.
1:10:29
That could be an hours long conversation.
1:10:31
I always do—I’d look at healthy queer relationships workshop for
1:10:35
queer students unions at colleges.
1:10:37
Cuz that’s what brought me there when I was 20.
1:10:39
It was like, “Just tell me how to say ‘no’ and not feel like
1:10:41
shit.” That’s all I wanted.
1:10:44
But I would say that, step one is at the beginning of a relationship,
1:10:49
where you have to respect yourself enough to not put up with shit.
1:10:53
Like, I’m not going to have you texting other people and doing this
1:10:56
bullshit if that’s not what we agreed.
1:10:58
And I’m not going to hang on, holding for this or that, no.
1:11:01
I never did that, by the way.
1:11:03
[Audience laughs]
1:11:04
Yeah.
1:11:04
My understanding is that, like, you’re going to shout at me,
1:11:07
I’m not with somebody that shouts at me, don’t shout at me.
1:11:10
That’s not what we’re going to do.
1:11:13
I think setting the stage there is really important so that you
1:11:17
develop a relationship that is honest and genuine to each other.
1:11:21
And there’s nothing that’s weird and stupid.
1:11:24
If you’re thinking about leaving the person you’re
1:11:25
with, you need to leave them.
1:11:28
I’ve never, not once, thought about leaving Trystan.
1:11:32
If you’re thinking about it, you’re in that place, you should just do it.
1:11:36
In terms of overcoming adversity, it gets really fucking hard.
1:11:40
And the truth is, you don’t like each other at times.
1:11:45
You know what I mean?
1:11:46
You’re not having much as sex as you want because you’re so stressed out.
1:11:50
So much happens.
1:11:52
But it’s about doing your best to come back together and
1:11:57
constantly communicate and talk.
1:11:59
One thing that, thank god, Trystan has always been really adamant about
1:12:03
this, is we have regular date nights.
1:12:06
Trystan is always like “We haven’t gone out to dinner with just us in
1:12:10
a minute and I’m going to put our schedules together and just do it.”
1:12:13
So in a relationship, you have to just have that time alone and together.
1:12:17
And then you have to have just an endless amount of compassion for the other person.
1:12:22
There has been so many times where I’ve had to bring something to Trystan where
1:12:25
I was positive that he would be pissed.
1:12:28
Because that is what most people might be.
1:12:31
And he would just be like, “I’m so sorry that you’re going through that.”
1:12:38
I’ve had substance abuse issues and I have to bring that to Trystan. And he
1:12:43
was just like, “Oh my god, I’m so sorry.
1:12:45
What can I do?”
1:12:51
Or even if I’m fucking up somehow, and Biff comes to me and it’s like “Hey, I
1:12:55
notice this thing you’re doing, and I want you to stop.” I have an initial defense,
1:12:57
like, “Well I do that—” And I always
1:13:02
am like, “Ok, no.
1:13:03
I want to be the kind of person someone can come to when I’m doing
1:13:06
something bad.” So I really, really try to be like “You’re right.
1:13:09
I’m sorry.” And see where is my partner right, how can I change?
1:13:14
And
1:13:16
we did the New York Times’ Love Challenge last summer, where it’s
1:13:20
seven activities over seven days.
1:13:22
It’s all evidence based.
1:13:23
They looked at the roomful of people who have been together super long
1:13:26
time, what did they do and then how can you build those things
1:13:28
into a relationship as you go.
1:13:30
And one of the practices that I use all the time is, when you’re
1:13:33
disagreeing, try to see what value your partner holds that is at the
1:13:40
heart of their actions or their belief.
1:13:43
So
1:13:45
if Biff and I disagree with how much support we give his family, for example,
1:13:49
and I’m like—“oh my god”—angry, but then I’m like “Ok, but why, what value
1:13:54
does Biff hold that is driving Biff to have this level of commitment to their
1:13:58
family?” And I’m like, “Oh, Biff would do anything for their family.” That’s a
1:14:03
really legit value to have in a partner.
1:14:08
[Audience agrees]
1:14:10
When there’s a disagreement, I always try to think what value that I care
1:14:13
about and love, and appreciate, is this coming from, and then going back
1:14:17
to that place and affirming that, and showing appreciation for that.
1:14:21
That’s something that I’ve been trying to do since we did
1:14:22
the Love Challenge last year.
1:14:26
It’s also really instinctive in a relationship, in any
1:14:28
non-romantic relationships.
1:14:29
When you have a disagreement, you want the person to agree with you.
1:14:33
That’s what you want.
1:14:35
There’re so many times where he’d be like “I’m giving you what you want.
1:14:39
What else do you want from me?” And I’d be like, “Well, I want you to
1:14:42
believe what you’re doing.” But the truth is sometimes somebody getting
1:14:47
you what you want, or doing what you’re asking them to do, has to be enough.
1:14:51
If the thing that I’m asking of Trystan is to just not do something, it doesn’t
1:14:55
matter if he is happy about it or not.
1:14:57
If he’s saying “I’m not going to do it,” the whole argument should just end there.
1:15:02
That took a long time for me to learn, cuz I’ll be like, “Well, I
1:15:05
don’t want you to do it regrettably.” We get so caught up in that.
1:15:12
Sometimes I think we should have a more transactional approach in
1:15:15
relationships, not about everything.
1:15:19
Yeah I definitely agree with that one.
1:15:23
Also, I just married the best person.
1:15:27
I mean it sounds cheesy but I just
1:15:29
married the best person.
1:15:30
So, that helps.
1:15:33
And so cute.
1:15:41
Ten years.
1:15:48
All of a sudden, you became internationally famous.
1:15:50
And there’s got to be positive stuff about that, as well as negative stuff.
1:15:55
So that’s one part of my question.
1:15:56
And the other part is about your background in performing arts.
1:15:59
Both of you are incredibly articulate.
1:16:03
Did you have that same kind of thing and how have you, Trystan, used that?
1:16:09
Was it just part of you that you took the training of performing arts, what
1:16:16
have you learned from that that’s helped you along?
1:16:20
The other thing I should mention is you have this extraordinary stage presence,
1:16:24
so when we watch your videos, it’s like, “That’s so funny, that’s so moving!”
1:16:31
It’s this weird thing where I just have this serpentine, or
1:16:35
circuitous, root of where I am today.
1:16:38
And every twist and turn made who I am today possible.
1:16:44
So me going to performing arts school means I’m not nervous in front of a room.
1:16:48
It means I know how to craft a story, the beginning, middle and end.
1:16:51
It means I know how to be really authentic and vulnerable in a way that stills
1:16:54
feels safe to the people that are there.
1:16:57
It means I know how to read the energy of a room.
1:16:58
Those kinds of things.
1:17:00
And then stumbling in the work in the taskforce, stumbling into this team of
1:17:04
people who learned how do you change someone’s mind about queer stuff,
1:17:08
that informs everything I do too.
1:17:10
I’d map out my audience mentally ahead of time, where are they on the spectrum.
1:17:14
What can I give the people in each stage that’s gonna move them
1:17:17
forward, that’s gonna be compelling?
1:17:19
Where am I gonna be funny?
1:17:20
Because—I’m sure you all know this, but—there’s an actual psycho-physiological
1:17:25
that happens when you laugh.
1:17:26
It short-circuits a lot of bias and bigotry.
1:17:30
If you can make someone laugh, then you’re literally hacking transphobia
1:17:35
and finding new ways to reach them.
1:17:38
It’s all a craft.
1:17:39
It’s not like I was born doing this.
1:17:41
It’s all very carefully worked out.
1:17:44
And all of it is evidence-based.
1:17:46
It’s all science.
1:17:47
That whole story, all science.
1:17:49
Every stage is doing something.
1:17:52
Hopefully—what did they say in theatre—you can’t see the choreography,
1:17:56
which means hopefully you can’t see the blueprint through me.
1:17:59
But all of that, I think, has made what I do now possible.
1:18:03
And also, like Biff alluded to, I’m just really good at taking notes.
1:18:08
If someone says do it this other way, I’m like “That sounds great!” And so I
1:18:12
just really, really try to be humble.
1:18:15
At The Moth, those people worked with me six times.
1:18:20
How much could I had paid for The Moth to teach me storytelling for six sessions?
1:18:26
There’s no limit to how much I would have paid for that.
1:18:29
I worked my ass off to get into The Moth because I knew I would get those things.
1:18:32
I’m just always looking for opportunities to grow and learn.
1:18:35
After every story, during my trans-pregnancy, I would sent the link
1:18:38
to trans-messaging director at GLAAD and be like “How did I do? What did I miss?
1:18:43
What can I do differently?” He would get on the phone with me and then he would
1:18:45
coach me based on that CNN story, or that People Magazine or that Cosmo, whatever.
1:18:50
And then I would iterate and change for the next one.
1:18:53
Every single stage—because I owe it to my trans people to do this right.
1:18:58
Not all of us are given an opportunity.
1:18:59
When was the last transman who was in the spotlight in the way
1:19:03
that I had a chance to be in?
1:19:05
It’s rare.
1:19:05
And I wanted to be really responsible.
1:19:08
And then Biff was in debate.
1:19:09
Yeah, I don’t have a theatre background, really.
1:19:13
But I also am not nearly as thoughtful about all of this as Trystan is.
1:19:18
The truth is I don’t accompany Trystan on most things, like I don’t
1:19:23
do well in interviews and stuff.
1:19:30
I don’t want to censor or shape what I’m saying.
1:19:33
That’s not an experience that I enjoy or like, but I know
1:19:36
I’m useful in different ways.
1:19:38
You know
1:19:42
we did a series of podcasts?
1:19:43
You can go listen to The Longest Shortest Time.
1:19:47
And I said some things that even after I hung up, I was like, “I gotta
1:19:51
call her back and tell her that she cannot include that in her podcast.”
1:19:59
So I have a tendency to do that.
1:20:05
Go off message.
1:20:05
To just totally go off message.
1:20:07
I can talk to people and be articulate.
1:20:09
But I’m not somebody that’s going to be leading a training
1:20:12
or standing on The Moth stage.
1:20:16
But they do perform for us a variety of skits such as reenacting the birth of
1:20:22
Jesus every Christmas Eve in puppet form.
1:20:27
[Audience laughs]
1:20:28
You do have good facial expressions.
1:20:29
Oh, it’s good.
1:20:30
It’s good.
1:20:34
I’m a fan of comedy.
1:20:36
I love funny and I want things to be funny all the time.
1:20:38
So I appreciate that.
1:20:39
I’m
1:20:43
just not nearly as developed.
1:20:45
I’m also not nearly as open to advice and criticism as Trystan is.
1:20:49
I’m not going to ask anybody what I can do better.
1:20:52
But
1:20:55
I would love to be in a place where I could do that.
1:21:01
What are your zodiac signs?
1:21:03
[Audience laughs]
1:21:04
Oh lord.
1:21:06
We both have strong opinions about this.
1:21:10
I want to hear ‘em.
1:21:12
I don’t understand anybody’s obsession with this.
1:21:14
It’s just one of those things I’m like, it is so far removed from anything
1:21:19
that is scientific or even sensical.
1:21:23
People that really love it, no offense to you.
1:21:25
There’s people that really love it.
1:21:26
But they can be
1:21:30
like, “Sagittarius is stubborn” or anything.
1:21:33
I’m like, you can basically say anything about it and everything is like “Oh
1:21:36
yeah, Leo.” So both of us feel that way though, there’s no disagreement.
1:21:42
But I would never say that.
1:21:43
This is an example
1:21:47
of it right now.
1:21:47
Just say Libra and keep moving.
1:21:49
My mom once told people that way, she’s like “You’re acting
1:21:51
like such a Capricorn right now.”
1:21:53
I know, and people view it as a weapon and they use it like an
1:21:56
escape hatch out of accountability.
1:21:57
[Audience
1:22:01
cross-talks]
1:22:01
I really truthfully just don’t get it.
1:22:03
But I’m sure that there are other ways in which I use them and
1:22:07
constantly that is also similar.
1:22:09
It’s just not called that.
1:22:12
You’re definitely a Virgo, right?
1:22:15
I’m a Sagittarius.
1:22:16
[Audience laughs]
1:22:18
And you’ve taken your children back to church, you said.
1:22:31
Not “back”, but to church.
1:22:34
Sorry, what was the question?
1:22:35
Take them into church.
1:22:36
All I heard in that was “church, church, church.”
1:22:38
That was the question.
1:22:38
Okay.
1:22:38
Yeah,
1:22:43
having been so rejected by the church as a young person, but also having
1:22:48
church been such an integral part of my upbringing, my whole value system
1:22:53
is based on Christian principles.
1:22:55
That’s what I was taught.
1:22:56
“Do unto others.” “Love thy neighbor.”
1:22:59
Right.
1:22:59
The story of Christ is one that’s been so muddied over time.
1:23:05
But it’s a pure, wonderful, beautiful story.
1:23:08
It’s a message of endless, radical compassion that the people that we
1:23:13
should embrace, and help are the most rejected members of society.
1:23:18
So, I believe so strongly in that.
1:23:21
Being rejected was really hard and I came to this place in my life in
1:23:24
recent years where I was like, “Wait a minute. I can reclaim that.” I can
1:23:28
find a church that I do agree with their values, and go and reclaim that.
1:23:34
Because it was taken and it was traumatic that it was taken.
1:23:37
It also meant that I was just like “I’m an atheist.” I’m still an atheist, actually.
1:23:42
But I really believe deeply in it would be wonderful it we could reshape what
1:23:49
effect the church has on our society.
1:23:52
Because the message of Christianity, as the message of Islam or almost any
1:23:59
other religion, is a positive message.
1:24:02
It’s a beautiful message.
1:24:04
It’s the
1:24:06
right thing.
1:24:07
So, all the time, I’ll engage with family members.
1:24:10
They think I’m very conservative on Christian things.
1:24:12
And I’m like, “Would you really believe that that’s what Jesus would do?” “Can you
1:24:19
really stand in front of me and say that Jesus would deny healthcare to somebody?
1:24:24
That’s what he would want you to do?” It’s so easy to engage on
1:24:28
those terms because it’s simple.
1:24:29
It really is simple.
1:24:33
And so yeah.
1:24:35
I’m just back to this place where it’s like “I’m just going to reclaim some
1:24:36
of that.” I enjoyed going to church.
1:24:38
It was fun as a kid.
1:24:40
I want to have my kids experience some of that too.
1:24:43
So I take them to church.
1:24:44
MCC, it’s Metropolitan Community Church.
1:24:47
It’s a historically gay church.
1:24:49
It was founded by gay people.
1:24:53
And oddly enough, my church is a bit what they call charismatic.
1:24:58
It’s not liturgical, it’s not like “in the name of the Father, the son—”.
1:25:03
It’s very much lively.
1:25:07
It’s like what you might expect in some of what black churches are
1:25:13
known for, being rowdy and lively.
1:25:17
So yeah.
1:25:18
I really felt like my kids would benefit.
1:25:21
It’s fun to force them to sit through church.
1:25:25
I’ll tell them what I told you, which is that when I was younger, my parents would
1:25:28
always be like—I was like “I’m so tired.
1:25:30
I don’t want to go to church.” And they would be like, “Jesus was not tired when
1:25:33
he died on the cross for your sins.”
1:25:39
So all the time now, I just bring that to my kids where I’m like, “Listen,
1:25:46
Jesus would have gone to church for you.” And they know I’m joking.
1:25:53
They’re always like “You can’t make us believe in God.” And I’m
1:25:57
like “I don’t believe in God.
1:25:58
I’m not trying to make you believe in anything.”
1:26:04
But yeah, the church is complicated, especially for queerness.

1:26:17

You talked about the experience of birth as being as close to God, and
1:26:41
you talked about it as being a miracle.
1:26:42
That
1:26:47

1:26:51
It was
1:26:54

The brain produces oxytocin which is the love chemical.
1:27:11
Everyone in the room, not just the birthing person, but the
1:27:14
doctors as well, and the baby.
1:27:17

1:27:18
You just get that hit of really good
