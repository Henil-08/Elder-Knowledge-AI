00:01
Today’s date is February 28th, 2020.
00:05
I’m Angelo Ursini.
00:06
This is an oral history interview with Robyn Leigh Tanguay
00:12
for the OSU History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:16
America oral history project.
00:19
We’re glad to have you.
00:20
Thank you.
00:22
First question, have you always had thoughts in the back of
00:25
your head about your sexuality?
00:27
I would say I more thought about my gender identity since I was very young.
00:31
Probably started having questions around five years of age and just
00:39
didn’t know what to make of it.
00:42
It was very early in life, yes.
00:45
What is your experience/relationship with the LGBTQ+ community?
00:51
When I was young, none actually because I was in a very
00:55
small town in upper Michigan.
00:57
So not very open-minded folks lived among—many cities, but—certainly
01:01
the little town at the time.
01:04
I was born in the mid-60s.
01:08
There was no community.
01:10
Any comments you would hear as a young person was all negative and derogatory,
01:18
which is of course frightening.
01:22
You wouldn’t talk about things like that to anybody.
01:24
There were no allies, no open-mindedness at all in my childhood.
01:31
Certainly, there would be no role models then.
01:34
Then it’s quite different.
01:35
You guys are all younger than I am.
01:38
Getting information in the 60s and 70s, there was no internet.
01:44
The library was quite small.
01:47
I went to a Catholic school.
01:48
You throw all that together—and no, I had no
01:53
real connections to any community other than Catholic, white, poor.
02:02
[Laughs] That was my community.
02:03
So how did you find out about the LGBTQ+ community?
02:07
It was later in life; I went to college in the
02:13
80s.
02:13
It was probably in high school.
02:14
I did some of my high school studies in California.
02:18
Certainly it’s a more progressive state.
02:22
And then certainly more reading, better libraries, better material.
02:27
But even then, that’s pre-internet.
02:28
So it wasn’t easy to connect to folks back then.
02:32
I certainly had a better grasp
02:36
of who I was, but not really able to do a darn thing about it seemingly.
02:42
That’s when I started to realize at least I’m not alone.
02:46
But it still felt like I was.
02:47
In my world, I may as well
02:52
have been.
02:52
When’s the first time you told someone?
02:54
That’s a great question.
02:56
Phew, it’s a very good question.
02:59
Probably in graduate school.
03:04
That would have been in the 90s.
03:06
It was a faculty member who was out.
03:13
We never really had a friendship or anything.
03:16
I
03:21
know I didn’t have the courage to tell anybody at that time.
03:24
Honestly, you kind of get programmed—you may or may not
03:28
know this—by all the negativity.
03:34
If you’re driven to succeed in anything, you avoid the things that
03:39
are negative and pushing you down.
03:42
You gravitate through the ones that are positive reinforcement.
03:47
Anytime I would hear negative comments around LGBTQ+ issues, you certainly make
03:55
note of every single one of them and protect yourself by avoiding those people.
04:04
So yeah, I became aware of folks, but I didn’t think I could, quote, “join
04:10
the community without jeopardizing my career.” That was a very heavy
04:16
decision that I made in my young 20’s. I thought they were mutually exclusive.
04:23
So, to be a successful scientist, I couldn’t let other part of me be real.
04:32
Has coming out affected your research grants?
04:36
Not yet.
04:37
I’m well-funded—have been for decades.
04:44
Honestly, I have not submitted a grant application since I openly transitioned.
04:51
I don’t anticipate challenges there.
04:54
I really don’t.
04:58
All science is really competitive anyhow.
05:01
I
05:04
really believe that it’s a highly competitive scientific discipline.
05:08
At least I’d like to believe and hope I’m right that the
05:13
competitiveness will not change when the reviewers review and see my name.
05:18
I certainly got a lot of emails from people in the field since
05:22
December when I openly transitioned.
05:25
At least everyone I heard from has been very positive.
05:28
These are world-renown scientists all around the world.
05:31
So I’m encouraged by that, guess the jury’s out.
05:35
I doubt it’ll affect it.
05:38
It’s decisions I make as a scientist which will jeopardize my success more than,
05:43
now, coming to get used to Robyn I think.
05:47
I hope I’m right.
05:49
Has it affected your relationships?
05:54
Yeah it has.
05:56
Boy, that’s a loaded question, cuz there’s lots of types of relationships, right?
06:01
I think my relationship with my spouse—so we’ve been married almost 30
06:05
years—I’m sure it’s been challenging for Sherry, but it’s been great too.
06:12
I think she sees how much happier I am.
06:16
We always had a great relationship, but I think it’s even better now,
06:19
as odd as that may sound to folks.
06:24
So my immediate family, I think, has been very positive, even better.
06:30
We didn’t have problems before.
06:32
I was really good at
06:36
taking that pain and discomfort and shoving it aside, and not
06:41
letting it affect people around me, so pretty good at that.
06:47
I have a large group of scientists in my laboratory.
06:50
Certainly
06:53
I worried about that for a decade, how I was going to tell
06:55
them—terrified me actually.
06:59
It’s been really positive.
07:02
I can pretty much tell where, for the students and my staff who
07:08
struggled with it at the beginning.
07:12
But I think overall, for many there’s a different level of, maybe respect for me?
07:18
That I was able to be open to them and to be vulnerable to them because
07:23
they don’t usually see me that way.
07:25
I’m kind of the boss—I don’t have feelings almost right?
07:30
I just have to be steady.
07:32
So I think that’s been positive with my colleagues in my department.
07:36
So far, it’s been pretty positive.
07:39
Certainly,
07:42
you get your radar up for more people.
07:46
Not necessarily that they’re discriminating, but they’re just
07:49
really don’t what to do with the new me and the discomfort.
07:53
So I’m still at that stage of working through some of those.
07:57
But so far it’s been pretty positive.
08:01
The small town where you grew up, how did they take it?
08:06
That’s a very good question.
08:08
My mother still lives in my hometown, so does one of my
08:12
brothers and my older sister.
08:19
I went there to visit them about a month ago, and it went really well.
08:28
Shockingly well, I might say.
08:31
My mom is 82 years old and she had said things in the past over my childhood,
08:38
certainly not about anyone in her family, because that’s not possible, right?
08:44
Again, all those things have been registered and hard-wired in my memory.
08:48
But she’s been great.
08:50
She’s been saying it’s gonna be hard to get used to me because I’m kind
08:56
of like their rock in the family.
08:58
But she’s been very open and trying really hard with the names, the pronouns.
09:06
My older sister has been
09:10
phenomenal, honestly and helped me a lot with that announcement to my mom.
09:14
I couldn’t be happier about how my siblings and my mother responded.
09:20
Do
09:24
you have any idea about where your future research is going?
09:30
Yeah.
09:30
I have a huge research program.
09:33
We have a lot of grants that are funded now for another four or five years.
09:38
We’re going to be focusing on
09:42
really at the core, trying to understand the chemicals that we’re
09:45
exposed to in our environment, in our food and air, pharmaceuticals for
09:50
example, which one of those chemicals can be harmful to humans and to the
09:57
lesser extent, to the environment.
10:01
We’ve built systems to efficiently ask those questions.
10:05
And then we are hopefully building towards a time where we can predict,
10:12
just by looking at a molecule, whether it’s dangerous or not.
10:16
We really can’t do that yet.
10:18
It’s not like, every chemical is equally evaluated.
10:21
Like, water would be just as toxic as cyanide, right, cuz you
10:26
wouldn’t know unless you tested it.
10:29
We want to be able to look at cyanide and say “yeah, that’s going to be toxic, this
10:32
compound’s not, this one’s the problem,” to really help people make better
10:36
decisions about what chemicals we should be using in our world around us. So that’s
10:42
a huge scientific question that we’re going try to tackle in the next however
10:48
many more years I have left working. It’s really predictive toxicology, predictive
10:55
chemical activity—is what I want to do.
10:58
And what advice would you give towards any person that has questions
11:02
about transitioning/questions about his or her own sexuality?
11:09
It’s really hard to tell anyone else what to do, because you don’t understand their
11:15
life history and their life contacts now.
11:18
Any advice I have, it would just be more general.
11:24
I guess I would say,
11:27
it can be scary for some people to
11:32
come out—the first thing, in the path I did, I found allies.
11:40
I found faculty here who had transitioned decades earlier
11:45
and who became good friends.
11:47
That was instrumental in me at least starting to finally believe that it was
11:52
possible, that I could be a successful scientist and mentor, and also transition.
11:59
I would say ten years ago I didn’t think it was possible.
12:01
I thought it was just going to be something I’m just going to have
12:03
to take to the grave with me.
12:07
And then listening more, reading more, meeting more people, then I started
12:12
to think—then you start imagining it.
12:15
Then that kicks in another problem that you’d imagine the worst, right?
12:20
Which I did.
12:21
Which actually probably made it more miserable for me.
12:26
I think finding allies who could listen to your fears and concerns,
12:31
and at least provide their prospective, is a good first step.
12:39
The other thing is that
12:43
certainly gender identity and sexuality, it’s important but it’s
12:47
not the only part of you, right?
12:54
You want people to accept who you are but there’s other expectations on you
13:00
in this world, right, in how to behave towards others and not to lose that.
13:08
Sometimes the treatment that you get is because of the way you act rather
13:15
than you’re always being attacked.
13:17
Sometimes you have a responsibility.
13:19
I think finding allies who can listen to you, give advice on how it can be done and
13:26
also some of the really positive outcomes.
13:30
If you can, kind of merge your life and be authentic and—All I can say, openly
13:37
it’s only been a few months for me,
13:41
but it’s had a huge impact on my mental health, I would say.
13:47
I’m always busy, and it’s shocking that I think I actually have, maybe, yet another
13:52
level of efficiency that I have released, by not having to deal with this other
13:57
part of me in a separate part of my brain.
13:59
I think, find allies,
14:04
understand that if there’s other things in your life this won’t
14:08
necessarily solve all of those.
14:11
[Laughs] But it won’t go away if you just try to suppress it and that hurts a lot.
14:19
Do
14:23
you see people any differently after transitioning?
14:28
I don’t think so.
14:29
I don’t know if it’s my scientific thinking or the way I was trained.
14:36
I have a lot of empathy, probably more than I should, so I really try
14:41
to understand people’s perspective as much as I possibly can, walk
14:47
in their shoes kind of thing.
14:49
I’m very perceptive to how people might be thinking or
14:54
how they might perceive things,
14:57
probably because I’m so paranoid about what they’re thinking of me, right.
15:04
[Laughs] I think I’ve been a very fair, balanced person
15:08
with the people I work with.
15:10
I think folks who work with me would probably tell you that.
15:15
I think what’s changed is that—many people, and they’re telling me
15:18
this—I’m noticeably happier.
15:22
If anything, they’ve noticed changes in me which are probably going to be reflected
15:28
back on them as a positive thing too.
15:32
We talked about it a little bit, but how was your coming out experience like?
15:37
Terrifying, absolutely terrifying.
15:41
And it’s not done.
15:42
It’s not done at all.
15:44
As I tell folks in my group that every day’s a new new.
15:52
My large group, that’s been accomplished for a couple months, my department
15:56
has been for a couple months.
15:59
When I have meetings with senior leadership on the campus, that’s
16:02
been about a month ago I had to go into the room for the first time.
16:05
That’s another coming out, honestly.
16:07
Or if I go and give a public seminar, which I did last week actually,
16:13
that was another form of coming out.
16:17
I’m on several federal advisory panels and I had to go to the
16:22
East Coast three weeks ago.
16:25
Entering that room was absolutely terrifying, because these are people who
16:28
respect me for my science and my opinions.
16:31
And now I’m asking them to get used to this big change, and
16:37
they don’t have to, to be honest.
16:39
I hope they did, but they didn’t have to.
16:41
I didn’t know how that was going to go.
16:43
That was another coming out.
16:45
I have another large scientific meeting that I’m going to in
16:48
two weeks with several thousand people, most of whom know me.
16:53
That’s going to be a whole bunch of coming-out moments for me.
16:56
I’m giving a talk in front of a thousand people.
16:58
So that’s going to be another coming out.
17:00
So
17:02
yeah, they’re work in progress.
17:04
So far, again, the folks who have talked to me have been positive.
17:08
I’m sure there’s a lot of uncomfortable people in the room
17:13
and hopefully, they’ll get over it.
17:15
Maybe they’ll grow, evolve from this process.
17:17
I hope that can be the case.
17:21
I think it’s going to be some time before I’ve entered all of the
17:24
parts of the world that I work in to see how that’s really going to
17:28
go in all those sectors and beyond.
17:31
But so far ok.
17:38
[Laughs]
17:39
In a little bit of the research that I did, it said that you’d
17:43
moved from Michigan to California.
17:46
What was one of the biggest cultural shifts you experienced after moving
17:50
from the Midwest to the west coast?
17:52
There were many.
17:53
As an example, first of all, everyone is white where I’m from—I mean, everyone.
18:03
I was in sports too.
18:05
I ran track and field.
18:06
I remember the day in 10th grade, the first time I saw a non-white
18:12
person—crazy, right—running in
18:18
the lane next to me.
18:21
That was a shock, just the fact that there were different types of people.
18:28
[audio cut off,]
18:28
Would you say that that was one of the most different
18:30
shocking moments that you had?
18:32
I’d say certainly the diversity, the different types of
18:34
cultures, was the biggest shock.
18:37
But it was a positive shock.
18:43
It was shocking but it was also fantastic to see different perspectives.
18:49
I certainly was massively influenced by that and it really
18:52
fed my interest of understanding, appreciating, and cherishing
19:01
different people’s perspectives.
19:02
That’s kind of what I do now every day in my professional life.
19:07
The other things that were memorable about that time was we were still very poor.
19:12
We had no money.
19:14
There was an awful time of my life, honestly, financially for a family.
19:20
But food, there’s actually good food in southern California.
19:25
There’s none in upper Michigan—I’ll tell you that right now.
19:28
So that was a shock, but a good shock!
19:30
I really think the diversity of people was the biggest, and the size of the school.
19:37
That would have been in my high school.
19:39
In Michigan, it was four grades, it was about 400 students.
19:44
And then my high school in California, it was only three
19:46
grades and it was almost 4000.
19:50
That was like, my city was my high school class.
19:52
So, that was pretty different.
19:56
And then has your background in more technical skills, such as shop
20:00
classes, welding, or electronics, influenced or affected your approach
20:05
in your scientific research?
20:08
Yeah.
20:09
And again, the reason I have those skills is because of where
20:13
I was born and raised, right.
20:16
The Midwest is—and particularly, where I’m from—very scrappy.
20:19
And technical training is common.
20:23
But also, more than that, it’s valued.
20:26
There’s a lot of respect given to people who have those technical skills.
20:31
I would say the inverse relationship in urban centers.
20:37
There’s actually disrespect for people who have the skills you just mentioned.
20:40
It’s more of the white-collar—money is what gets you respect rather
20:44
than what you know how to do.
20:46
I think just the fabric of that society is that technical training is a good thing.
20:54
So how did I channel that?
20:56
I did okay as an academician, as in college and graduate student.
21:01
So I had to learn those other things, obviously.
21:05
But I have all the other technical skills.
21:07
Most of my colleagues aren’t from these types of background.
21:12
They don’t have any of those skills, which translated to
21:16
me being able to build things.
21:20
Even if I don’t physically build them anymore, I have staff that I
21:24
can communicate what we need built.
21:27
I can talk, equally verse-talking, to someone who won a Nobel
21:31
Prize in medicine as I can to a welder or an electronics person.
21:36
I have absolutely no problem seamlessly doing that.
21:39
Merging that kind of miserable town that I lived in, experience in those skills,
21:44
with the skills that I acquired later in life in college actually is an advantage.
21:50
I’ve taken advantage of that.
21:53
We use it every day.
21:54
Every day, we’re building things and using those types of skills to do so.
22:07
I think that’s all I have.
22:16
That’s all we have for you.
22:17
Thank you.
22:17
Okay.
22:18
Alright.
22:19
Thank you.
