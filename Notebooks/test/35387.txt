00:02
Today’s date is March 2nd, 2020.
00:04
My name is Wynton Skowrup.
00:06
This an oral history interview with Professor Dan Dowhower in Corvallis,
00:11
Oregon, for the OSU History 368: Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:15
America Oral History Project.
00:20
Our first up prompt is: Where and how did you grow up?
00:27
I am from the Midwest.
00:29
I’m a Wisconsin boy.
00:31
Grew up in southeastern Wisconsin, in a city called Racine, Wisconsin.
00:36
I was one of four kids, the third in line.
00:43
My mom was a stay-at-home mother.
00:45
And my father worked in a factory.
00:47
So, we were pretty much a blue collar, lower-middle-class family.
00:52
And lived in one house for my entire life.
00:57
In fact, my parents still live in the same house I grew up
01:02
in.
01:02
Growing up, I was sent to a parochial school, K-8th grade.
01:08
And then after that, I went on to public school, which is probably
01:11
the best decision I’ve ever made in my life and categorized
01:14
myself as a recovered Catholic.
01:18
So, that was kind of the formative years growing up.
01:21
Where I grew up,
01:24
pretty blue-collar neighborhood, kind of inner city.
01:29
How would you describe your family while you’re in a close family life growing up?
01:34
We’re pretty tight, actually.
01:36
I think that
01:40
my parents really made sure that we worked together as a family, that
01:46
we had meals together every night.
01:50
Mom being the traditional mom, of course, she did the domestic thing during the day
01:55
and then made dinner so the entire family would eat together every single night.
02:00
And we had conversations.
02:03
Looking back on it, I think that one of the interesting differences, when I think
02:08
of myself compared to other friends, is that ever since we were kids, all
02:14
four of us had a voice in our house.
02:16
And what we contributed was taken with importance by our parents.
02:25
I think that there was a lot more communication than I realized, growing
02:30
up between my family and my siblings.
02:33
And to this day, we’re pretty much still in contact with
02:36
each other all of the time.
02:38
We now have a family text so now it’s a little bit more technologically based.
02:44
Growing up, it was straight forward.
02:46
I mean, you had your brother and sister argument.
02:50
But I think at the end of the day, it was definitely a place—in my home,
02:54
at least for me and my family—that if everything else was failing me, I knew
02:59
I had a place to go and have safety.
03:04
Could you give us a quick survey of your coming out story?
03:07
It’s kind of a funny story.
03:10
So it’s really complex because I think if you think about that formal statement that
03:18
you say “Hello, guess what? I’m gay,” that didn’t happen till I was 30. But the irony
03:27
was I didn’t feel like I had to come out.
03:31
So, growing up, I’ve been in a relationship with my
03:34
partner since the age the 19.
03:40
It was pretty clear that—at least I thought it was clear—there was
03:46
this relationship that was being acknowledged by everybody in my family.
03:55
And as we grew up, we went to graduate school together, we
03:59
moved to another city together, we bought a house together, it was a
04:03
single-bedroom apartment before that.
04:06
So, what was very interesting was one day, my mother called and
04:14
she—and this is a story you’ll hear me tell in public too—called to let
04:19
me know she was upset that Sonny Bono had died in a skiing accident.
04:24
And I said, “Well, that’s very interesting.” I said, “But do you know
04:29
Sonny Bono?” And she said, “No, but I was more upset with Chastity’s response.”
04:35
At the funeral, she talked about being a lesbian and how her and her father
04:42
weren’t seeing eye-to-eye on this.
04:44
And it was at that time, my mother said, “I don’t understand
04:47
why she would have to do that.
04:52
She could’ve corrected that for herself.”
04:56
And it was at that point I’m kind of like, “Um, what?” I
05:00
said, “Hey mom, you know what?
05:01
Can I give you a call back in a minute,” and hung up the phone.
05:05
And I talked to my partner—at that point, 12 years—and said,
05:11
“Here’s the interesting thing.
05:13
I don’t understand what’s going on.” And so I wrote a letter
05:18
to everybody in my family.
05:21
Everybody got this letter.
05:23
And
05:27
I sent out letter out.
05:27
And a couple days later, of course, I got a phone call.
05:31
And my mom was really distraught.
05:33
She didn’t realize, in her words, that I was gay because I didn’t act gay.
05:40
And I joked with her, I said, “Well, you just need to talk to the right people.”
05:45
But I think for her, it wasn’t that she had a problem with me being gay.
05:49
In fact, my partner, and my sister, our partners that very much been incorporated
05:59
into the family as much as anybody else.
06:00
And
06:05
it was something that you guys were mentioning with regard to
06:11
some of the history that you’ve been exposed to in this class—is
06:14
that I came out in 1981.
06:18
So this is in AIDS crisis that hit the United States.
06:21
And I think, for my mother, she was more thinking if I wasn’t, then I was safe.
06:31
But once we talked about it, she was like, “Oh my gosh. Put
06:35
your partner on the phone,” and talked and everything was fine.
06:39
And of course, my father got on the phone, and I said, “have you heard any
06:43
good secrets?” And he said, “Nothing I haven’t known for a long time.” So,
06:48
all of this was really to help support my mom understand that this was the case.
06:54
So I guess, technically, at the age of 30 is when I came out.
06:58
But it was, I think, for a very different reason.
07:02
Not because I had to come out, but I think I had to let my
07:06
mother know that I was okay.
07:10
Alright.
07:11
I’m Ray Wolf and I’m gonna ask you some questions.
07:19
We know that you have kids.
07:20
And we were wondering how the adoption process went.
07:27
What did you have to do?
07:28
Well,
07:30
we lived in Ohio at the time.
07:32
And one of the things that was amazing—this was of course
07:40
almost now 20 years ago—that
07:46
in Ohio, they didn’t recognize same-sex partnerships.
07:51
In
07:53
fact, most of the effort was to prevent anybody who identified as a member of
08:00
the LGBTQ community from really anything.
08:07
So what happened is when we decided that we were interested in adopting
08:10
kids, we actually had to find an agency who was willing to work with us.
08:18
And as we went to different agencies, for example, we went to Catholic
08:25
charities and they told us, “No.
08:29
We’re not going to work with you,” because basically our life is a sin, right?
08:34
So why would they expose a child to that?
08:36
But we ended up with the Jewish Community Federation.
08:42
And they were so incredibly welcoming.
08:47
And they totally lived up to their mission that families are based in love,
08:54
not in terms of gender distributions.
08:57
But that being said, the entire process, my partner had to go
09:01
through as a single parent adoptee.
09:04
I was not recognized by the law, nor was I recognized in any of the paperwork
09:12
as something other than just a friend that happened to live in the house.
09:16
But what we did was, I crossed out “friend” on every part of the
09:23
document, and wrote “parent two” above it, which really kind of helped
09:30
when you get further down the road.
09:31
And
09:34
the Jewish Community Federation did not say “You can’t do that.”
09:39
I think they were like, “Do that,” because this is how change happens.
09:43
You’ve gotta identify yourself properly.
09:46
But as
09:50
we move forward, even though I wasn’t being recognized as a potential parent,
09:59
we had to go through the same process as anybody else who was interested in
10:04
adopting or even doing foster care.
10:08
And that included FBI background checks, we had
10:14
to give our fingerprints to see if there’s any history of crime or ill-intended
10:20
behavior, whatever that might be.
10:23
We actually even had to have our dog reviewed.
10:27
It was a small 18-pound West Highland White Terrier.
10:32
And we had to confirm that even the animal was safe for a child to be in
10:37
the house, and along with about 39 hours of parenting training which was
10:45
a really eye-opening experience for us.
10:48
Because what was really amazing was how much more we knew, but how
10:55
little people who could be parents without adoption didn’t know about
11:01
nutrition, exercise and emotional wellbeing, and these kinds of things.
11:07
So it was a real eye-opener.
11:09
But
11:12
we knew we were kind of breaking the new frontier so we just
11:16
headed down and powered through.
11:17
And,
11:22
geez, maybe a year after we did all of that paperwork and work, we were
11:27
identified for our first child.
11:29
And then three years later, we got our second.
11:35
Then, living in Ohio, what happened was they decided to change the definition
11:41
of marriage in the constitution that it was only between a man and a woman.
11:47
And it passed.
11:49
So, what that meant for us was they were going to, then, prevent anybody
11:57
who wasn’t married from being able to do adoption, much less foster care.
12:04
So at this point, even though
12:08
my partner adopted the children, there was no legal connection to me.
12:14
So, I might joke about it, but as a citizen of the United States of America,
12:21
I had to become a political refugee.
12:23
And we moved to Oregon because in terms of job opportunities, Oregon
12:29
was the only place that would permit me the ability to adopt our kids.
12:38
And so after six months here, I adopted the kids.
12:44
And the state of Oregon asked Ohio to reissue the birth certificates, at which
12:50
point, upon the receipt, my partner was identified as the father and I am
12:55
listed as the mother of my children.
12:57
They couldn’t even change the form.
12:59
So you know, that’s fine.
13:01
I get Mother’s Day presents now, and I don’t care.
13:05
A parent is a parent.
13:06
So, that’s that whole adoption process.
13:11
The thing that was really interesting for us as
13:18
we got more support from the community of color than we did from the Caucasian
13:25
community around adopting our child.
13:27
Of course, we had dear friends, but in terms of outside in general public
13:34
realms, it was often people of color would approached us and said “Thank
13:42
you for taking care of our babies.” And I said, “Well, I think your
13:47
babies are also taking care of us.”
13:48
So, it was an amazing experience.
13:53
And
13:56
when both of these children became available to us, in terms of having to
14:01
go before—cuz it sounds like a sales pitch, to be quite honest with you.
14:06
Adoption is unlike “Oh, here.
14:07
We found one and we’re gonna give it to you.” Your social worker has to go in
14:13
front of a number of other social workers.
14:15
And they all discuss their families and try to figure out what,
14:20
and who, would be the best fit.
14:22
So even though you might have seen a child, the toughest part of it
14:28
was that you couldn’t get excited.
14:31
You didn’t walk down the aisle.
14:33
You had to wait.
14:34
And that was an interesting process because being two men, we
14:42
couldn’t, obviously, get pregnant.
14:44
So we had no maternity or parent leave.
14:49
So, when the first adoption occurred, we were given eight days of leave
14:56
to be able to take care of matters.
14:59
Now, think about this, so you have people who have carried
15:02
this child for ten months.
15:06
They deliver and then they get an additional six months off.
15:10
We got eight days to transition and an established person into a completely
15:17
strange environment with two people that this person, these people don’t know.
15:23
And we got eight days.
15:25
And we were able to arrange things because of the kind of work we’re in.
15:32
But it was still very much an amazing difference
15:41
that adoption is not treated as an equal kind of thing when it comes
15:47
to having a child, biologically speaking, your own child.
15:50
So that was a real trip.
15:54
And in my class, I talk about gender roles.
15:57
And I think
16:02
the one thing we heard so often was “Well, who’s going to be the mother?” And
16:09
the irony was, in many of these cases, they didn’t know who the father was.
16:15
So all of these children are being released for adoption, and it’s
16:19
clear that from a male perspective, the message is fathers don’t
16:25
matter, but mothers matter more.
16:30
So that was always kind of an interesting experience because, as two men raising
16:39
two children, that we had—and we did it cuz it was fun—to really learn
16:50
a whole different part of life.
16:55
And I will tell you if I saw you on the street and you were
16:59
a person of color, female, I’d walk up and say “Here’s my story.
17:07
This is what’s gotta happen.” I even learned how to do hair thanks to YouTube.
17:12
I could cornrow and plait and straighten and braid.
17:18
But all of that was all on us.
17:21
There was no real community that was available to us, to gay men with children.
17:30
But we certainly built a community that then led to a very different
17:36
kind of existence—not only for us, but for our kids—that was much richer
17:39
and deeper than we ever imagined.
17:44
Thank you.
17:45
So, what challenges have you faced raising kids in this environment?
17:52
Like stigma?
17:57
We’ve actually been pretty lucky.
18:02
I think
18:05
that anybody who knows us as a couple, and us as a family,
18:14
very quickly understand that.
18:20
We’ll talk about it.
18:21
And if there’s a reason to have to have deeper conversation.
18:27
Then we’re gonna do that.
18:32
But in terms of being gay parents, like I said, we were
18:37
actually really, pretty lucky.
18:38
We didn’t get much
18:42
backlash.
18:45
There was a time, however, where we were out with our first
18:50
child and getting into the car.
18:53
And we got pulled over by the police cuz they thought we were kidnapping our child.
18:59
So, that was an interesting thing because people are like “Well, that’s
19:03
a good thing, right, that they pulled you over?” Sure, it’s a good thing.
19:07
But are you pulling over everybody who doesn’t look like a typical family, like
19:14
two white parents with an Asian child,
19:21
or a single parent father with the kids?
19:25
Are they all getting pulled over?
19:27
And that was kind of the conversation we ended up having to have—is that I
19:32
appreciate that you’re looking out for the safety of this child, but are you
19:37
looking out for the safety of every child?
19:39
Because if you’re pulling us over—and I quote—"cuz we looked different”,
19:45
you’ve gotta admit we look different. I said “Well, then you have to admit
19:50
that we are not the only ones that look different. Then are you pulling
19:52
over everybody that looks different?”
20:01
The thing is you can either get angry about it, or you can be productive.
20:08
We always chose to be productive.
20:09
Sure inside, you get really angry, like, “Come on, yet another time I have to do
20:15
this.” It’s like when they talk about coming out, right? You have to come
20:19
out multiple times in your life. You don’t just get to come out once, right?
20:24
So sometimes it gets tiresome.
20:28
And it gets old because it’s really irrelevant at some point.
20:31
Like, “What does this have to do with what we’re doing right now?”
20:37
But we also saw the value and decided that this was—and I love
20:42
Michelle Obama—so we chose to go high rather than go low because high
20:49
always turned out better for us.
20:52
And people appreciated hearing our story.
20:56
It wasn’t like they’re doing things on purpose.
21:00
I had never been able to fault somebody for something that
21:03
they’ve never been exposed to.
21:06
If you’ve not had an experience with a family like ours, then how can I
21:11
expect you to rely on anything other than stereotypes or weird expectations?
21:19
But once you get to know us, then now you don’t have a
21:21
reason to rely on those anymore.
21:24
Now, you’ve been converted, so to speak.
21:27
Does that…?
21:28
Yeah.
21:31
And what made you and your partner want to adopt kids or have kids?
21:40
Actually, it’s kind of funny.
21:43
My partner always wanted kids.
21:45
I knew this right out of the gate.
21:47
Me, I’m like “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t cuz I don’t like kids.
21:51
It was “I don’t know if I’d be a good parent.”
21:56
Sometimes I get a little short.
21:59
I was like “I don’t know that I’m a good parent material.” And then we spent a
22:06
long time talking about it, which is really interesting because when we talked
22:12
to other friends that have children that they’ve had biologically, when we
22:18
tell them the kinds of conversations that we were having, they were like “We
22:22
never even thought about any of that.
22:24
We were just happy we were pregnant and then we had a little party, and
22:27
then we figured it out from there.”
22:29
But we really needed to have our ducks in a row, because we knew
22:33
that we were up against—might be a strong term—but we were up against
22:40
a lot of people who were against what we were doing.
22:44
And
22:47
I remember we were sitting on a beach, and we sat and we talked about
22:53
parenting style, what do we feel about in terms of how you take corrective action.
23:03
Neither one of us ever believed in any kind of corporal punishment.
23:08
So
23:10
what’s the common language we want to use to say “Okay, look, this probably
23:16
wasn’t the best choice to make.” So, we really talked about all of those things.
23:22
Parenting and nutrition, what our expectations of
23:26
each other as parents were.
23:31
There were some compromises.
23:32
One of us, me,
23:38
I’m more comfortable having to deal with diapers so it doesn’t bother me.
23:42
The other one, sometimes he could get a little gaggy.
23:47
[Laughs]
23:48
So we did that.
23:53
We had a lot of conversations about it.
23:56
So when we walked into this process, and the social workers would ask
24:03
questions or the service would ask questions, we had the answers.
24:07
And we had the answers immediately because we did a lot of reflection.
24:12
And
24:15
ultimately, I relented because after all of those conversations,
24:23
I thought “Maybe I am gonna be an okay parent.” And we reflected on
24:28
the way that we were raised and what
24:32
liked and what we didn’t like, and we want to do differently.
24:37
We talked about education, we talked about how do you create an independent being
24:43
and what age should we start doing that.
24:45
We really talked about all of these things.
24:49
So,
24:52
yeah.
24:52
That was, I think, the
24:57
difference.
25:02
I guess we were just ready.
25:05
So we decided that we had answered our questions, and we were ready to go.
25:10
And so we did.
25:12
We did right away.
25:15
As soon as we got back from that beach, we started hunting
25:18
down people who’d work with us.
25:20
And we haven’t stopped since.
25:22
So,
25:26
I’m gonna shift a little bit the theme.
25:29
I want to ask you about your experience with marriage.
25:32
What was your life like before marriage?
25:38
I always—and we always—joke with our friends who could get married,
25:42
is that we’ve been together for 36 years, so we outlived many of
25:48
our friends’ first, second—and even in some cases—third marriage.
25:54
Because for us, we didn’t have a legal document tying us together.
26:00
There was no magic thing.
26:03
We literally were like, “I wanna spend my life with you, so we are going to do
26:07
this.” And if we’re going to do this, there’s gonna good times, there’s gonna
26:12
be rough times, and there’s gonna be shoot, bad times. But it’s what you do.
26:17
That’s life.
26:20
So, for us, we
26:28
always have felt married.
26:29
There wasn’t anything that we didn’t do that didn’t
26:33
“approximate” marriage, if you will.
26:36
So, when the option even became available, the only reason we
26:42
wanted it was for tax purposes.
26:48
The term marriage, in terms of what’s being “protected”, held
26:54
no value to me, none whatsoever.
26:56
Because that was clear, to me, that its really bad success rate was not something
27:04
I was interested in investing in.
27:07
In fact, when we decided to get married, one of our friends said
27:13
“So, are you excited?” I said, “I’m not sure.” I said “I haven’t had any
27:16
good role models for marriage.” And they’re like, “What do you mean?” I
27:20
said, “Everybody I know has gotten a divorce,” I said, “so I don’t have any
27:25
good role models because a good chunk of the people I know never survived it.”
27:33
So, for us, it was just a chance to have some of our closest friends together and
27:44
have this interesting ceremony, and celebrate and have fun.
27:50
In fact,
27:56
we got married in Washington because at the time Oregon hadn’t
28:01
made marriage legal at this point.
28:04
And we’re sitting in front of the TV.
28:06
And it was the IRS that came out and said, “You know look—particularly from
28:11
veterans with same-sex partners—if you get married in a state—and at that time
28:15
there were only 5 states that you could get married in—that if you got married in
28:19
a state that allowed same-sex marriage, that that what other state you lived in,
28:25
they had to recognize it too.” So this is kind of the beginning of the end of DOMA
28:30
and this fight against same-sex marriage.
28:35
So, we looked at each other, and I’m like “So what do you think?
28:38
You wanna get married?” And he goes “Eh, I think about it sometimes.”
28:43
And then he goes, “How about you?” I said, “Ah, I don’t know.
28:45
I kinda got commitment issues.
28:47
I’m not sure we’re gonna be able to make this.”
28:50
So it’s just all in fun and good.
28:51
And it was an amazing experience that then when we went to organize this
29:00
activity, the person on the phone that was a marriage planner at the location
29:10
said, “So, tell me, what does your ideal wedding sound like?” And I said, “That is
29:18
a question I never expected to be asked.” I said “So, I don’t have an expectation.”
29:24
I said, “I don’t even have a dream” because I’ve been told my entire life
29:28
that that dream was not mine to be had.
29:33
I said, “It’s gotta involve martinis for sure.” And I said “But I
29:38
don’t know beyond that because we were told we could never do this.
29:44
But guess what, we’re gonna do it now.”
29:47
And we had to go get our marriage license in Washington.
29:53
And it was this little teeny tiny town in Washington.
29:56
So we were like, “Oh boy.
29:58
How is this gonna go over?” When we walked in, to the license bureau and we
30:06
said, “we’re here because we’re getting married and we need to get this marriage
30:09
license,” you would’ve thought celebrities walked in. These people were so welcoming
30:15
and so lovely that they were like, “Everybody, everybody! We’ve got a couple!
30:20
We’ve got a couple!” So, the thing is that if pain and suffering are all you expect,
30:28
then all you’re gonna experience, right?
30:30
So we just went in thinking “It is what it is and just, same with adoption-” But
30:35
it’s just been good. It’s just been good.
30:38
And life’s got haters in it.
30:43
They’re about as important to me as nothing so I don’t have time for haters.
30:46
And we just keep moving on.
30:48
So,
30:52
that was marriage for us, and has been for us.
30:56
And folks would say, “Well, now that you’ve gotten married, how many
31:00
years have you been married?” And we’d joke “Oh uh-uh, that piece of
31:05
paper doesn’t mean anything.” We have done our tour of duty, cuz we
31:08
were at 30 years when we got married.
31:11
And I said, “So, we’re going into our 31st year.” There’s no “one” anymore.
31:18
This is our tour of duty, we’ve been here.
31:21
And in fact, we should probably count ours like 210 years, in gay people years,
31:28
cuz we’ve had a lot more to stay together than most people have ever had to, right?
31:33
So it’s all been very fun.
31:35
It is what it is.
31:37
Can you talk about the changes in cultural mindset from when you guys
31:41
first got together and present day?
31:44
Well, yeah.
31:46
I can remember as a kid that there were no words for this.
31:51
I remember as a kid, growing up thinking something’s not the
31:55
same about me and the other guys.
31:59
“I don’t know what it is but they’re all going right and
32:02
I’m coming on left over here.
32:04
I don’t understand what this is.” And growing in a Catholic church—and boy,
32:10
we’re seeing it rear its ugly head again—I was told that a relationship
32:20
between two men is a sin, blah blah blah, all that stuff, right.
32:25
And yet,
32:30
here is this priest in front of me who was clearly
32:36
not straight.
32:37
But
32:42
then when we were growing up, things seemed to start maybe
32:45
moving in the direction that we saw the Stonewall thing catching.
32:51
And it was growing and growing and growing.
32:54
But in 1981 when AIDS hit, it’s almost
33:01
the same thing that’s happening with the Asian population and the coronavirus.
33:05
All of a sudden, someone needed to be blamed.
33:09
And someone needed to have to deal with all of this anger from society.
33:16
So as a country, we did no favors for anybody buy calling it a gay disease.
33:24
Because we knew around the world that that was in fact not true, that there
33:30
were hemophiliacs and heterosexuals, people who represented something
33:38
other than men who have sex with men, that were getting this disease.
33:42
So we’re still fighting that.
33:45
So, for us, it really was kind of this thing that
33:54
you had to learn to be very cautious.
33:56
So, what’s interesting is that people will throw this word “queer” around.
34:04
Every time I hear it, it upsets my stomach because that was not a nice
34:08
word. And I understand taking the ownership of it, and I’m all about it.
34:13
But you will never hear me refer to myself that way.
34:17
Not because I’m embarrassed but because I have been on the receiving end of
34:22
that word, and there was nothing but pure venom and hate being delivered
34:28
with the use of that term, right.
34:29
So, it was a very different world.
34:33
And then, in the 80s, it was very different with HIV on the scene.
34:40
One of the, I think, interesting benefits of meeting your life partner
34:46
at the age of 19 was that we were never really part of the scene.
34:51
We didn’t go out to bars.
34:53
We didn’t hang out.
34:55
We weren’t even part of that.
34:56
So, in a lot of ways, we kinda skipped over that because we’re like “Well, we can
35:02
go to graduate school, or we can go out.” And we’re like, “Well, we’re going to
35:06
graduate school.” So, that’s what we did.
35:08
So, in some ways, our experiences as a gay couple were —or even as
35:14
gay individuals was—very different.
35:16
Because we always were kind of in the shadows of an academic world.
35:24
And we were very careful with our identities then too because there
35:28
wasn’t any protection even then.
35:31
And you would think, “Look, you’re in literally this liberal location.” But
35:38
that’s not necessarily accurate—you can’t make those assumptions. And we certainly
35:42
couldn’t do that, because we saw people losing their jobs and getting kicked out,
35:46
and not getting their leases renewed, and getting beaten up for being who they were.
35:54
So that just made our resolve even stronger.
35:56
In fact, we came to react with the human rights campaign and started doing
36:03
a lot of work to bring more light.
36:07
And we decided that we needed to come out stronger so that for
36:15
those younger folks coming up, that they needed to see somebody.
36:19
They needed to know that this is gonna be okay.
36:23
Because we all carry baggage that someone’s not gonna like, right?
36:28
So, the idea is, you know what, own it and walk proud, cuz what else have you got?
36:34
And if you do that, if you’re not acting ashamed, then I think it
36:37
takes power away from everybody else.
36:39
Then there’s no reason to be ashamed.
36:42
It’s just it is what it is.
36:45
For our last main question, I wanted to ask what drew you to the profession
36:50
of teaching, and how do your life experiences inform your teaching?
36:54
Wow, that’s an interesting question.
37:03
I’ve always enjoyed teaching.
37:06
I’ve always enjoyed it quite a bit.
37:08
And my entire life was not necessarily higher ed or education per se.
37:15
I was very much involved in training and development and
37:21
selection system development, and working in organizational settings.
37:28
And that, I really enjoyed.
37:30
But what I started feeling a little creepy about was that I was helping
37:37
organizations make sure that these people were as happy as they possibly could be
37:42
to maximize profits for the organizations.
37:47
And I’m like, “Hmm, I don’t know if this is really what I wanna do.”
37:53
That’s when we lived in Chicago.
37:55
But then when we moved to Ohio, I got into higher ed in the area
38:02
of—I was involved in—research for a while in mental health issues.
38:09
Then got into career services, and then advising.
38:14
And then I got into the world of admission.
38:16
And I became a director of admission.
38:19
Then we relocated here.
38:21
And I was back to advising.
38:23
And then while here, I actually became lucky enough to get this job that
38:31
involves issues around accreditation.
38:35
And one of the things was—before it was the College of Public
38:39
Health and Human Sciences—and they wanted to make that transition.
38:43
I was the person that reviewed some of those documents to help
38:47
them get ready for that transition.
38:49
And it was in that that I learned about public health.
38:53
And I’m like, “Oh, this is it.” So I went and I got my master’s.
38:58
And then got a Ph.D. at the age of 52 when I was finished.
39:06
And during that time, I used my training because I really think it’s important
39:14
to communicate and to work with people, and to be really open to not saying
39:23
“What I’m telling you is right,” but saying “This is what I know and how
39:29
does that resonate with you,” and with that, where do I get to learn and grow,
39:36
and where do you get to learn and grow.
39:38
So, I’ve never—even when I was a trainer—ever walked into a room
39:44
thinking that somehow I held the keys to the kingdom, cuz I just
39:47
don’t believe that that’s true.
39:48
So while I was in graduate school here, I was able to teach.
39:53
And it was just something that really resonated with me and became my passion.
40:00
So, that’s really how I got into higher ed from a faculty side.
40:04
I’m not your traditional faculty member cuz I started out in administration
40:09
and then came over to faculty, where often it’s the reverse is what happens.
40:13
But
40:17
all that to say is that it really has informed who I am as
40:23
a teacher, my life, the kinds of things we’ve been talking about.
40:30
Like I said earlier,
40:34
it’s not for me to judge whether you’ve had the right or the wrong experiences.
40:40
All I can say is that I assume you’ve had some experiences.
40:44
And I’ve had some experiences.
40:46
And some of those experiences might be similar, and some
40:48
might be very, very different.
40:50
But what is the common ground and what are the things that we
40:53
can take from that information?
40:56
And then when you contextualize it within a class, like one of the classes I teach,
41:01
then that’s the same kind of process.
41:06
I teach really uncomfortable course topics.
41:09
I teach STIs/HIV, human sexuality, and then drugs, behavior in society.
41:15
These are not Thanksgiving dinner table conversations.
41:18
So, I think that I shock a lot of people, because I have no business
41:25
teaching this class if I’m not gonna be honest, transparent and
41:28
comfortable teaching it, right?
41:32
So I think, for me, those are really core values to who I am as a person
41:36
so it jibes well and makes teaching these courses very easy for me.
41:41
So I think, in some ways, I’ve always been destined to work as an educator.
41:49
Of where that was, was more to the fates rather than my active
41:54
choices that I was making.
41:55
But I think that my life experiences certainly had brought me to the right
42:00
place and time, and content and topic.
42:05
Does that make sense?
42:07
Totally.
42:09
Unless you guys have any more follow-ups, I think—
42:11
I think that’s pretty much it.
42:12
Do you have any questions for us?
42:14
No.
42:15
I think this is a really exciting thing.
42:17
And it’ll be interesting to see the final product.
42:24
But I think, you know, what you guys are doing is really important.
42:30
That people need to know our stories.
42:33
And it doesn’t just need to be the LGBTQ story.
42:34
It just needs to be
42:37
stories.
42:38
And I think that we have forgotten how to share our stories with other people.
42:46
I think we rely a lot on technology.
42:48
And we don’t have conversations.
42:52
We just Google what we think we need to know, or we text without really
42:58
thinking about what’s going on.
43:00
I think this human connection piece is really important.
43:06
Really important if we want history to
43:11
reflect—how do I say this.
43:13
How
43:16
we behave now certainly sets our future.
43:19
But when we look back to say what have we learned, having our stories
43:24
being told teaches us “Wait a minute, have we remembered to share
43:31
our stories.” Because I will tell you that far more often in my life,
43:39
I have more in common with people not because I might be gay or I have kids.
43:52
But it’s that I have had to live through policies and laws that have worked to hurt
44:03
rather than improve humanity, and that I have learned how to manage a great life
44:13
within the constraints of some of these very restrictive kinds of things, and
44:21
running across people who have exactly the same stories but their stories are not
44:28
because they’re gay or they’ve adopted.
44:31
Their stories are because of whatever they’re bringing to that table.
44:34
And I think that the connection that we get is so much stronger because we’re
44:42
not connected because we’re both gay.
44:46
We’re connected because we both are humans that have had these
44:48
experiences and can reflect
44:53
on these things that worked against both of us, and
44:59
to say, why?
45:00
Why would we continue to do this?
45:04
So, your allies become broader and deeper in many of these areas.
45:10
And I think this kind of project helps with that.
45:14
Now I’ll get off my soap box.
45:16
[laughs]
45:16
Thank you so much.
45:16
Thank you very much.
45:18
Thank you.
