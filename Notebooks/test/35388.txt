00:02
Today’s date is March 4th, 2020.
00:06
Our names are Emelia and Stephanie.
00:09
We’re doing an oral history with Brian Parks for the OSU History 368: Gay and
00:15
Lesbian Movements in Modern America.
00:18
So, what is your name, and can you please spell it out loud?
00:22
Brian Parks.
00:23
B-R-I-A-N P-A-R-K-S
00:27
And when were you born?
00:29
I was born June 17th, 1975.
00:32
Where did you grow up?
00:34
I grew up as an air force brat but mostly in Dallas, Texas.
00:40
How would you describe your childhood?
00:43
I would say that I had a really idyllic childhood.
00:46
My nickname was “Beaver” as in Leave It to Beaver.
00:50
I have an older brother, two happily married parents, very comfortable
00:56
middle-class suburban lifestyle.
01:01
I had a great childhood.
01:04
What political views did your family hold when you were being raised.
01:11
I would say my parents were both kind of classically conservative,
01:17
but conservative by definition 30 years ago, not conservative in the
01:24
way that that holds meaning now.
01:29
I wouldn’t call them socially progressive at that time, because that wasn’t really a
01:32
thing necessarily, but they were both more or less West Coast people living in Texas.
01:39
My parents actually met at OSU and got married here in the late ‘60s.
01:45
And after dad was drafted, moved to South Dakota—where I
01:51
was born—at an air force base.
01:54
And then moved around a little bit after that.
01:55
But settled, essentially, in
01:59
Dallas, Texas.
02:00
Did you stay in Dallas, Texas, all your life?
02:02
Until high school.
02:03
Until I graduated.
02:04
I had, in some nerdy fashion, already decided—even when I was really
02:08
little—that I would come to OSU.
02:10
We would come here on family vacations and go to the coast.
02:14
Oregon was still our heart state, in a way.
02:18
We were in Texas because my dad worked for American Airlines.
02:21
It was really just a job.
02:24
Essentially, after I walked across the stage and got my diploma from graduating,
02:28
we all got in our cars and drove out here.
02:30
My parents moved to Seattle.
02:32
And I came to OSU that fall.
02:35
So, it was kind of predetermined.
02:38
In high school, were you involved in athletics, clubs, anything of the sort?
02:43
No, I was in band.
02:46
In Texas, that’s a pretty big deal because it’s marching band;
02:50
football in Texas is everything.
02:53
I did it essentially, as a way to get out P.E. because I was
02:58
the typically male paranoid young closeted gay kid, I didn’t want to
03:04
take showers with all the other guys.
03:06
So, I went into band.
03:08
It suited me because it was all sort of the misfit kids.
03:11
I ran with—I think we called it—the black t-shirt crowd.
03:16
We always had Cure t-shirts and messed up hair and makeup, and nose piercings.
03:21
It was sort of a way of buffering ourselves from the popular kids who would
03:26
pick on you because you were different.
03:28
But if you were extra different, they would kind of leave you alone.
03:31
So, I went with that as sort of
03:36
a classics ‘80s New Waver kid.
03:41
Were you ever bullied?
03:43
For sure.
03:47
Yes, much more in a way of being intimated.
03:54
It’s hard to explain.
03:55
It was just a given that we were the misfits.
03:58
So
04:01
I went through one school system until I switched to another school
04:06
system my senior year of high school because I hated the school that I
04:10
had been basically brought up in.
04:14
It was very, very wealthy.
04:16
It was very white.
04:17
It was very socially, classically aggressive male, sportsy kind of thing.
04:25
And I had some friends through my church group at other high school.
04:29
And it was much more mellow and much more easy-going.
04:33
So I switched my senior year to a different high school.
04:36
Bullying, for me, was more so just implied.
04:41
You just live with a lot of stress of not belonging, a
04:44
lot of mutterings of “faggot”.
04:46
Just little bits and pieces.
04:48
I never got beat up.
04:51
I remember one moment being in P.E. class in junior high, and some guy
04:59
was throwing a basketball at me.
05:01
I was sitting at the bleachers, just trying to disappear and avoid everybody.
05:04
And this basketball kept slamming from side of my head to this
05:08
side of the head, to this side of head, to this side of the head.
05:10
I just tried to ignore it.
05:12
And then the coach came in and saw what was going on, and made me go down
05:17
to do push-ups in front of everybody.
05:19
And that was pretty typical Texas machismo sort of thing.
05:24
That to me was bullying.
05:26
It was basically more implied, not necessarily physical but menacing.
05:33
Were your parents aware of this happening?
05:36
I don’t think so.
05:37
Not really.
05:37
I was a pretty quiet kid.
05:39
I had a lot of friends.
05:41
I had a great social life.
05:42
But I spent the majority of my time as a nature geek.
05:46
I’d ride my bike out to the woods and fish and catch snakes
05:54
and do insect collections.
05:57
I was perfectly happy and content on my own in the woods.
06:01
There were armadillos.
06:02
For me, Texas was a really place to grow up as a nature geek because
06:06
it’s a confluence of tropical and northern, and I can go on and on.
06:10
I was happily entertained with just playing in the woods.
06:14
And how did you discover your sexuality?
06:18
I don’t remember not knowing that I was gay.
06:24
Earliest memories are of really innocent crushes on my father’s pilot friends.
06:32
[Laughs] Really truly.
06:33
But as a little kid, I thought it was something that I actually could outgrow.
06:38
I planned on going west.
06:39
I was gonna go west, and then I would meet a woman that I would somehow find
06:43
attractive, because be out on the West Coast, and be rugged and be whatever.
06:48
When you’re really little, you think your orientation is more
06:52
malleable than it really is.
06:53
Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t.
06:55
But for me, it wasn’t.
06:58
But I remember being very cognitively aware, as a second
07:03
grader, that I was madly in love with a few of the fifth-grade guys.
07:09
It was something that I knew I would never share with anybody, and is kind
07:15
of one of the biggest aspects of my life that shaped me as who I am now.
07:21
You learn, as a little gay kid, to get to know yourself intimately.
07:25
You’re in with your own thoughts, I think, to a different degree or in a different
07:31
manner than most kids are, because you know that you’re something different.
07:34
You’re a different animal.
07:37
Maybe there’s guilt and shame involved with that, maybe there’s not.
07:41
For me, there was, because it was Texas, we went to a pretty conservative church.
07:45
My youth pastor, I remember him saying something about how he would never
07:48
allow a gay person around his kids.
07:51
It
07:54
was outspoken and pretty much understood across the populace that gay people
07:57
weren’t very cool and couldn’t be trusted with your kids, and with
08:00
this dark, evil force and sad and miserable, and never going to be happy,
08:03
and probably going to die of AIDS.
08:09
There was no gay figure in the public eye that was healthy
08:15
individual by social standards.
08:18
The only gay people that I was aware of were musicians like Boy George or this
08:24
sort of more fantastical characters.
08:26
So, there was no average Joe gay person on TV, buying a hamburger at McDonald’s.
08:32
It was, just didn’t exist in the populace.
08:37
I knew I was something different.
08:39
And I knew it wasn’t something I can share, really.
08:42
You mentioned being part of the conservative church with your parents.
08:46
Did they ever speak about homosexuality?
08:50
Or were they ever aware of you being gay?
08:54
They weren’t aware of me.
08:58
They weren’t worried about me, but they were pretty convinced
09:01
that my brother was gay.
09:04
We didn’t talk about this as a family at all.
09:06
This really just came out much later in life.
09:08
I came out before my brother.
09:11
My brother is also gay and currently happily married.
09:14
So they weren’t expecting me.
09:17
Then when I came out before him, it was kinda like, “Oh,
09:19
crap. We got two gay kids.”
09:24
I think they were pretty much “Live and let live.” But my dad had said a few
09:28
things on occasion which he deeply regrets now. I had an out, gay friend who my
09:36
parents kind of didn’t want me to hang out with, sort of marginalized in a way, and
09:40
he was really my best friend at the time.
09:43
I remember trying to have a conversation once, because I had
09:45
been really angry with my parents and my mom asked me how he was doing.
09:50
And I said “Oh, he’s doing really great.
09:51
He’s lost a lot of weight these days,” because he had a weight problem.
09:54
And my dad was like, “From what?
09:55
AIDS?” And I remember just “Ah…” It was this devastating thing to me.
10:00
I was very angry at my dad for years about that.
10:04
But they were any more or less homophobic that anyone else.
10:10
They were just average white people who’re unaware of what it was to be gay.
10:15
Just white, middle-class.
10:18
Didn’t really have any gay people in their life that they knew, so
10:21
it was obviously this other thing.
10:25
Did you ever have relationships with girls or guys throughout high school?
10:30
Not really.
10:31
I had had one girlfriend who sort of forced me into it.
10:36
[Laughs] We were friends.
10:37
And I thought she was a lot of fun hanging out with.
10:38
Then she started telling my friends that she was worried I was gay, so I ended
10:42
up counting to five one night and kissed her, just to prove to her that I wasn’t.
10:46
Then, all of a sudden, everyone was like “Oh you’re dating.” And all of sudden,
10:48
I was dating somebody. But I knew it was wrong. It didn’t feel good to me at all.
10:53
It was terrible.
10:53
We weren’t ever intimate.
10:55
It was horrible.
10:59
And she was kind of an awful person in the end, so it was easy
11:01
enough for me to call it off.
11:06
For a while though, it felt really good to be normal and to lose that fear
11:11
that I had that I would be found out.
11:13
Or to thumb my nose at all the cool kids in school, because I was dating somebody,
11:20
“turns out I’m not gay.” I remember even my close friends, their nickname for me
11:26
was “Tink” or “Tinker Bell.” And it was affectionate, but still somewhat hurtful.
11:34
When did you graduate high school?
11:36
I graduated in 1993.
11:39
And when you moved to Oregon, were you nervous, scared?
11:44
Did you have any friends who also were going to OSU?
11:47
No, I didn’t know anyone who was here.
11:50
By luck of the draw, I ended up on an all-guys floor of Finley Hall.
11:55
At that time, I was kind of intimidated by the general straight, male population.
12:02
Although I had a lot of straight guy friends in Texas, somehow I
12:05
felt moving out here was gonna be different and intimidating.
12:09
But by the first month of my living on that floor, we were fast friends
12:14
and we adored each other, and we got in all kinds of trouble.
12:17
And most of my friends by the end of my freshman year were
12:22
typical straight male guys.
12:26
And when did you join the Lesbian Avengers?
12:30
That’s such a funny question to hear.
12:32
So, I’m really a Lesbian Avenger
12:38
just honorarily.
12:40
At the time, I wasn’t considered one.
12:44
I eventually came to terms with my sexuality towards the end
12:47
of my freshman year of college.
12:49
Realized nothing was gonna change.
12:52
I came out to a couple close friends who were very supportive and encouraged
12:57
me to go and meet other gay people.
13:02
So essentially, I came out to my parents, I came out to everyone
13:05
in my life in one fell swoop.
13:08
And I didn’t want to control that information anymore.
13:11
I didn’t want somebody to know and somebody to not know.
13:13
So, all across, I told everybody.
13:15
And
13:18
all of my guy friends were like “Whatever, awesome. I don’t care.
13:22
You’ll probably help me get girlfriends.” It was a
13:27
nonissue for me.
13:29
I went to—at the time, it was call—the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Alliance.
13:35
It was a small group on campus.
13:37
We met in the Women’s Building.
13:38
On my first meeting, first time I went—and of course, I’m just nervous as hell—Derek,
13:49
who was Amy at the time, said “We need another co-director.” Derek, who was
13:56
Amy, was female at the time, she said she was the female co-director of the
14:01
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Alliance. And the charter really didn’t allow for the group
14:08
to exist without a male counterpart.
14:11
It was written so that there would be a guy and a girl to balance things.
14:14
And there wasn’t a guy, so they were worried about losing funding
14:18
and losing the group if there wasn’t a male who would do it.
14:21
And somehow, I raised my hand and I said “Sure, I’ll do it.”
14:25
So really, right out of closet as a little baby gay, I all of
14:28
a sudden was a co-director of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Alliance.
14:33
Then from there, everything just happened really quickly, actually.
14:39
It was surreal.
14:41
I came out really fast.
14:44
Within a couple of weeks, I ended up on the front page of
14:47
the Barometer for coming out day.
14:49
And the entire campus knew.
14:53
All of a sudden, bam, I was out.
14:55
There was no baby stepping into this.
14:59
It was just bam, I was out as I could be.
15:03
While I was still growing into my own shoes as a gay person and learning what
15:07
it was to be openly gay, I was all of a sudden a public figure in one fell thing.
15:12
Back to Lesbian Avengers,
15:15
Derek and Julie had started the chapter here.
15:20
About two years, we became very close friends, very, very good friends.
15:26
So I’ll flop back and forth.
15:29
I’ll say “Amy” because
15:33
when I think back to there—it’s Amy but it’s Derek. If that’s
15:38
all confusing, I apologize.
15:40
But, Amy and I would hold hands and skip through campus.
15:43
And she was this very, very attractive lesbian woman who
15:48
was very gender-ambiguous, very classically masculine in some ways,
15:54
very classically feminine in others, and was attractive to everybody.
15:59
Amy was hot.
16:00
Amy was really, really attractive.
16:03
And to most people, they thought she was a young man.
16:07
So, we would hold hands and skip through campus, and people would be
16:10
like “faggots” and we would just laugh.
16:12
It was hilarious to us.
16:14
I ended up moving in with them.
16:16
And our house was essentially the gay seed of Corvallis.
16:24
In any one moment, we would joke a well-placed bomb could destroy
16:28
all the gays in Corvallis because we’d all be at this one house.
16:32
So, I’m honored to be called a Lesbian Avenger.
16:36
I think it’s the most kickass thing ever.
16:38
But at the time, I wasn’t really an avenger, although I was with
16:42
them and we did things together.
16:44
I would have never inserted myself into that definition because I respected them
16:51
as lesbian women and I was a gay man.
16:55
I mean, we would joke that I was towel boy for the Lesbian Avengers.
16:59
But it’s sweet now to be considered one.
17:02
I’m incredibly proud of it.
17:05
They essentially
17:08
raised me, when I came out.
17:11
I didn’t really identify with any particular political stands or way of
17:16
being as an out, proactive gay individual.
17:23
There were no other men present, essentially, at the time.
17:26
They were sort of figures that would come and go.
17:28
And they were secretive and very much wanted to be anonymous.
17:33
They did not want anyone to know that they were gay.
17:36
So, they would come into meetings but then watch the door when they left.
17:39
And for me, that was too much.
17:42
I just couldn’t control my life that way.
17:46
I’m way too open, way too out.
17:48
It was just “Ok, I’m out.” Like I said, I didn’t want to control that
17:53
kind of information, so I was out.
17:55
And the only other people that were out at the time was Derek and Julie.
18:02
The three of us, probably with another core of 11 other people, were
18:07
the only folks who would be visibly present, at one event or another,
18:11
and not run when the cameras came.
18:13
So, essentially, it was me and a pack of really awesome lesbian women.
18:21
And so I was an avenger by default.
18:25
What were the first meetings like?
18:31
Avenger meetings were always at our house.
18:33
And I would be there, I wouldn’t be there.
18:36
Like I said, I wasn’t really necessarily an avenger.
18:38
I was more so co-director with Derek for the Queer Alliance.
18:47
Their meetings were fun.
18:48
I honestly don’t really remember.
18:50
I was only at a few of them.
18:51
I don’t remember exactly what all it was.
18:54
But it
18:56
was really damn cool.
18:59
They would do tattoo nights and hair cutting nights.
19:07
They mixed a lot of play time with some really radical activism.
19:17
I was especially taken with them because of how articulate they were.
19:21
We would do panels for human sexuality classes.
19:24
There’d be like 300 people in this auditorium and it would be three
19:29
or four of us sitting on stage.
19:30
We’d try to get a lesbian woman and a gay man, maybe somebody—trans
19:35
wasn’t exiting at the time as a definition necessarily—but maybe
19:39
someone who was gender-fluid.
19:42
And then all these kids would be throwing questions at us.
19:45
A lot of them were filled with snickers, they weren’t sincere questions.
19:49
They were like “What do you do when you take a shower,” that kind of thing.
19:55
Derek would always answer with the most articulate, calm response.
20:02
And I was so crushed out on him for that.
20:06
It was remarkable.
20:07
He would always it into something really educational and sort of smack it back
20:12
in a polite way that was like “You look like a stupid person for asking that.”
20:16
“Showers aren’t sexual things for us.
20:17
We take a shower for a purpose.
20:21
After a day at the gym, we take a shower.
20:24
It’s not a sexual event.
20:26
It maybe is for you, but we don’t view it as a sexual event, so
20:29
it’s really not an issue.” It’s essentially how he would answer a
20:33
question like that, he was brilliant.
20:36
I feel really honored to have been part of that circle because really
20:43
complicated subjects were handled so articulately almost without emotion;
20:49
not reactive, just very matter of fact.
20:52
It was really powerful, and changed a lot of people’s minds at the
20:56
time, cuz it wasn’t anything to teehee or snicker at, really.
21:00
Were you ever harassed on campus?
21:02
No.
21:04
I had sort of a surreal existence.
21:08
And this is where it’s kind of complicated.
21:10
I got away with what I did
21:16
because I was passing, because I didn’t act like a gay man.
21:19
And I didn’t dress like a gay man, and I wasn’t super effeminate.
21:23
I had a nick truck and I went hunting.
21:26
I was this very passing, palatable gay man.
21:30
So I could go and meet with the fraternities and the
21:34
sororities, and co-sponsor events because I wasn’t threatening.
21:38
I wasn’t typically gay.
21:40
It was almost like my superpower.
21:43
It’s a bittersweet thing because I was there as an advocate for all gay people.
21:49
And it was frustrating to me that I knew I was only being
21:52
accepted because I was passing.
21:55
Handsome guy with this cool car, he’s a cool guy.
21:58
He’s a cool bro, he’s got this great music collection and all of these
22:00
things that were somehow important.
22:03
And I know if I had been classically effeminate, I wouldn’t have been
22:07
able to make the strides that I did.
22:10
So, like I said, it’s bittersweet.
22:12
I never got any kind of harassment.
22:15
And if I did, it was funny to me.
22:16
Like, I was DJing for
22:22
the first drag show at OSU, and—a really, really fun memory of mine—we
22:28
didn’t realize it but the ballroom had a country western dance going
22:32
on, so we could only get the steps of the MU to do the drag show.
22:36
So we were all up on the steps.
22:37
And I had my records playing and stuff.
22:40
And these awesome queens had come down from Portland.
22:43
We were doing their thing.
22:44
And all the country western people had to walk pass us to get into the front.
22:49
And they were just kinda horrified at it.
22:51
And I remember one guy was like, “faggot” and it just made me laugh.
22:54
It was like these bitches could kick your ass.
22:57
Like, say it again louder, I dare you.
23:01
So, for me, not to trivialize homophobia, but I didn’t really experience it.
23:06
Long story short, I just didn’t, for whatever reason.
23:09
Maybe I didn’t notice it.
23:11
But I got away with it just because I was passing.
23:16
Did you, or anyone you knew—were they ever scared for their life?
23:20
Absolute, especially
23:23
the Avengers.
23:25
Anyone who didn’t really fit in.
23:28
Their stories speak to it more than mine.
23:32
But their hotline was constantly being filled with death threats.
23:37
We still have the tapes.
23:38
I think they’ve been donated to the archives.
23:39
But it happened all the time.
23:41
People would always call—and it was before we could really trace calls—and
23:45
anytime that there was a public function where the Avengers showed
23:49
up and did something, or were being proactive, like at a women’s basketball
23:53
game, there were tons of hateful phone calls and threats all the time.
24:01
And Safe Ride had just started at that point.
24:05
And I remember them coming to us and having the conversation about helping
24:09
us feel safer and offering us rides.
24:12
And I was like “Yeah, but do I need a gay card to get on?”, because typically
24:17
they didn’t offer rides for men.
24:18
It was just for women.
24:20
And I was like “Well, how do we do that?” Like I said, I myself
24:25
wasn’t really necessarily worried.
24:27
I lived in sort of a bubble compared to everyone else.
24:29
But yeah, definitely they were—and still are—threatened.
24:34
Derek has a
24:37
very different existence to me, because of his being trans
24:42
and very passing now as a man.
24:48
Did the administration back you guys up in any way?
24:52
Or did they make things worse for you?
24:58
They were pretty much just annoyed with us at first.
25:06
It was a quieter time, like I said.
25:08
Gays really didn’t exist in the public eye.
25:11
This is pre-Ellen.
25:13
It’s funny to use that term but it’s really true.
25:16
We didn’t exist in any sort of public format like we do now.
25:22
There was no Queer Eye, there was no RuPaul.
25:26
There was nobody in media that was openly queer.
25:31
And if they were, like I said, they were some sort of a character
25:36
persona, like a Liberace or whatever.
25:39
That’s what gay people were.
25:52
So we set up a tent like they still do, in the quad.
25:55
And it got harassed every year.
25:58
We sort of asked for it a little bit, just because of the conversation.
26:01
Like we did a lot of chalk work in the quad.
26:02
Like
26:07
we wrote “Bert and Ernie are gay.”
26:11
Then, people would retaliate. And there was one that as like “Silly
26:15
faggot. Dicks are for chicks.” People would return the thing.
26:21
So we ended up sleeping in the tent every night just to keep it safe.
26:25
And one night, a group of guys came out, and shot a shotgun off over
26:31
the tent at two in the morning.
26:34
And that was absolutely terrifying.
26:37
Absolutely terrifying.
26:41
Anna Jacobs—and this is how fierce these people were—before anyone even knew what
26:47
was going on, she got up, ran out of the tent, and chased the guys and actually
26:52
kicked one of the shoes off of one of them, as these people had just shot a gun.
26:57
That’s someone who’s willing to die for this, essentially.
27:01
It’s really one of those badass things I’ve ever heard of in my life.
27:06
I kind of lost my mind after that.
27:08
It was so stressful to me.
27:09
I couldn’t find my car for a couple of days.
27:11
I knew it hadn’t been stolen but I couldn’t find it.
27:14
Really rattled me, absolutely.
27:16
It was the most afraid I had ever been.
27:20
That next night, a bunch of the faculty did come out and stay with us until late.
27:26
Then we just sat in chairs.
27:27
I
27:31
think President Byrne came out that night, and a few other pretty high up
27:35
faculty people came out to offer some sort of solidarity, which was touching.
27:40
But they should have anyways.
27:41
So, for that next week, we wore targets around.
27:48
We just bought targets at Bi-Mart.
27:49
This is where the Avengers are, again, really freaking smart.
27:53
And we wore them on our backpacks, around our back.
27:55
And the general feeling was that we were being crybabies.
27:58
People were writing into the Barometer and saying, “Oh these people are just
28:02
looking to get attention.” It felt like it missed everybody that that was a gun.
28:09
It missed everybody that someone shot a shotgun off in the middle of campus, in
28:15
the middle of the night to threaten us.
28:17
Everyone just thought we were being crybabies.
28:19
It was like “Those guys should shut up and just go away. Why do you got to make
28:24
this all about you?” It was just weird.
28:28
They just thought we were drama queens.
28:29
It was how people reacted.
28:31
And faculty privately would tell you that their hearts are breaking for you.
28:37
But there wasn’t a lot that people would do publicly for it, unless they’re
28:42
already known to be out and queer.
28:45
But still, it was very much not that supportive.
28:55
Did the police ever get involved?
28:57
They did.
28:59
There were certain people on the police force that would do anything
29:04
for us and really watched out for us, that took it seriously.
29:08
But again, the majority “Meh” just sort of wanted it to go away.
29:14
I think most people saw us as rebel rousers and causing all of these problems.
29:20
Rather than being the victims, we were inciting all of this.
29:25
And if we’d just shut up and go away, it wouldn’t happen.
29:28
“It wouldn’t happen if you didn’t dress like that.” It’s the same
29:34
way that women get re-victimized for dressing too provocatively and
29:39
then that’s why they got assaulted.
29:41
It’s like “If just you would assimilate, none of these would happen.” “Just
29:45
shut up and be normal, and no guns would have gone off” and whatever.
29:54
You guys talked about how you also stood up for those who couldn’t
29:57
stand up for themselves, like racism.
29:59
Was the climate ever super racist on campus?
30:02
Oh, totally.
30:03
I
30:06
moved here from a very racially blended part of the US.
30:11
A third of my high school was Asian, a third was Hispanic.
30:16
It was very evenly a melting pot in Texas.
30:21
And I moved here and was sort of in shock.
30:24
I was just like, “I haven’t seen a black person in a month.” And when
30:28
I would see somebody, I would find myself staring and being like “Oh
30:30
my god.” It was very, very white.
30:33
It still is, much less so than it was then.
30:42
Back then, it was an incredibly white campus.
30:45
And if you were a person of color, it was just assumed that you were in sports.
30:50
And that’s the only reason you’re here.
30:51
And generally understood that that was the thing, that was just how it was.
30:57
I never saw a whole lot of overt racism other than just people being
31:01
stupid, uneducated, not realizing what they said was hurtful.
31:08
Again, it’s just a matter of people being unaware because
31:11
they’ve not experienced it.
31:12
All of these kids, coming from all over Oregon from largely white
31:15
communities, don’t know any better than to make a stupid racist joke
31:20
just because they were ignorant.
31:21
They’ve never had a black friend and they’ve never met a black person.
31:24
And they don’t understand that it’s actually offensive.
31:27
And they’ve never been on that side of things.
31:31
What does activism mean to you?
31:36
It just means being visible.
31:38
I think “visible” is the best word I could say for anything
31:41
that I would consider activism.
31:45
My activism was just visibility.
31:47
It was just showing up.
31:49
It was just being able to let it be known that I was who I was.
31:54
It wasn’t necessarily carrying a torch or a bullhorn, or all of those things.
32:00
It was really just being present, having a sticker on my car.
32:07
Because I knew what it would have meant to me to have seen that myself as a
32:12
kid and seen somebody represented.
32:16
For me, activism is just being genuine, being yourself.
32:20
Sounds a little corny, but it’s really true.
32:23
If only people would have been more out, I think everyone
32:30
would have such an easier time.
32:31
It’s a lot less isolating when you realize that there are actually
32:34
quite a lot of people around you that are just as queer as you.
32:39
Much less isolating.
32:43
Would you consider yourself an activist still?
32:46
Mm-hmm.
32:47
[Positive tone]
32:47
And were you ever criticized for being an activist by your family?
32:53
I wasn’t criticized for it.
32:54
My parents were less than thrilled because they were scared.
32:58
They were worried about me.
33:01
They saw me in the Barometer—and I was pretty open with them about it—and
33:10
they saw it as a distraction to my schooling, which it was.
33:12
I ended up sacrificing my college career for this.
33:15
But to me,
33:20
I couldn’t even question it.
33:22
It was an imperative.
33:23
I had to do it.
33:24
There was no other way for me to move forward without being out.
33:29
I don’t know how else to explain it, it just was something I had to do.
33:35
But now they’re incredibly proud.
33:38
Now, my parents are beyond proud of what I did back then.
33:45
This last year, I got invited to be the keynote speaker for the Lavender
33:49
Graduation, which is freaking awesome.
33:52
My parents came and they sat in the ballroom, and they met in the ballroom.
33:57
It was their anniversary.
33:58
So it was this big, full-circle thing.
34:01
They were so proud to see me up there, addressing everybody.
34:05
And they get it now.
34:06
They understand the choices that I made for sure.
34:09
You said that you sacrificed your college career on your activism.
34:15
Can you go further into that?
34:16
Sure.
34:17
So, I came here for horticulture and landscape design.
34:20
I loved those two things that I was doing here.
34:25
I was very typical in that I went right from high school into college and didn’t
34:30
think much about that transition or what it meant, it was just what people did.
34:38
I excelled in the classes that I enjoyed, and I was terrible
34:42
at the ones that I didn’t enjoy.
34:44
Then when I compiled that with the distraction that was
34:51
the activism that I did at the time, it was just too much.
34:55
Eventually, I was giving, and not really being fed.
35:01
It
35:03
was really hard.
35:04
Essentially, just by default, I was the person that people would come and talk to.
35:11
Kids would come and talk to me.
35:12
Their parents had just kicked them out of their house.
35:14
They didn’t know where to go.
35:15
So, all of a sudden, I’m like this authority and I’m supposed
35:17
to be helping all of these people.
35:18
I remember one young man who had come out to his parents.
35:23
He was 14.
35:26
And his parent had gone to the extent of making him eat on paper plates
35:32
and plastic forks because they were sure he had the AIDS, because that’s
35:35
what it was when you’re a gay kid.
35:37
He had siblings who lived in the house who got to eat on regular china.
35:41
He was just same as all of them, but he was a gay kid.
35:44
And he ended up leaving.
35:46
I have no idea where he is now.
35:47
That was sort of the heartache that was shoveled on us all the time.
35:54
It was awful.
35:55
I really didn’t have enough resources in me to be the supportive person that
36:00
I really needed to be at that time.
36:07
Essentially, I just got so burned out on school, I couldn’t handle it.
36:12
I took some time off, moved back to Seattle for a term, and then came back
36:17
here to go to culinary school at LBCC.
36:20
Just sort of started anew there.
36:22
And realized, in a sense, that hands-on learning was much better suited for me.
36:28
I don’t sit still very well for very long.
36:31
And I loved culinary school.
36:32
It was actually one of the best decisions I made.
36:35
I own a restaurant now, so it all really made sense in the end.
36:38
But, had I not done the activism that I did, I probably would have stuck
36:43
through and graduated, and probably taken a different path in life.
36:52
How was being a part of the Lesbian Avengers influence your future?
36:57
I’m much more inclined to speak up.
37:04
I’m not apologetic when it comes to how I see or feel things.
37:10
It’s sort of the gift that they gave me.
37:14
When I say I was raised by them, it was really true.
37:16
Their political views were, “We speak up. We say what’s right.
37:20
Even if it’s really uncomfortable and even if it means our lives
37:24
are threatened.” They went to task on everything that was right.
37:27
They were very righteous people.
37:29
And I was someone, like I said, who was really passing.
37:35
I could just disappear into the crowd and no one would know I was this gay person.
37:38
I could just fit in really easily.
37:40
But what I took from them was really to speak up for
37:46
the people who don’t fit
37:49
it.
37:49
That’s really the best thing that came out of that for me.
37:54
It was just that sense of “speak up for people and do what’s right,” even if
38:00
it puts you in a dangerous position and it’s uncomfortable. It’s just important.
38:05
It’s super important.
38:07
Are you taking part in any activism now, today, with any
38:13
problems?
38:14
No.
38:15
Not in sense rather than just living my life.
38:17
And when I meet people, when they see that I have a ring on my hand and they
38:22
assume it’s a wife, I just very easily, quickly say “oh, my husband.” I make a
38:27
point of not letting any of that slide.
38:32
I want to be as much myself as I can.
38:37
Not in an aggressive manner, but I just make sure that people
38:42
know who I am and where I stand.
38:45
That, to me, is just my activism really.
38:47
I’m
38:50
really proud of my restaurant.
38:51
We have a very gay-friendly space.
38:58
I make a point of that in a way—I don’t necessarily hire people because
39:01
they’re gay—when people come in that are obviously a gay couple, we make sure
39:09
that they feel welcome and safe there.
39:11
We’ve had some people come in that were Corvallis Gay Professionals—is
39:15
what they called themselves.
39:16
I haven’t seen them in while.
39:17
But they would come and put this little piece of paper on their table.
39:21
And it would just say “All gays welcome. Corvallis Gay Professionals.”
39:25
They would have appetizers and stuff.
39:27
We ended up putting that on our Instagram and just like “Yeah, this is us. This
39:30
is something that’s important.” And Corvallis restaurant community, in
39:35
general, is very queer friendly and very open. So, it’s not like it was
39:39
some big, radical move on our part.
39:41
But it’s just important, I think.
39:45
Do you that the climate has improved in the US, or just, say, in Oregon?
39:53
What are some places where you think it hasn’t improved?
39:56
It’s definitely improved.
40:02
It never would have occurred to me to even ask for gay marriage back
40:09
then.
40:09
It wasn’t even a thought in my head.
40:11
I never even thought we would even have that conversation.
40:15
That’s not necessarily a milestone for everybody.
40:17
But it is, for a lot of people.
40:22
It’s improved just in general visibility.
40:25
There are a lot more normal people that are out there.
40:28
Like Miley Cyrus can go and date a girl and it’s not the end of the world anymore.
40:34
People aren’t falling apart over those sorts of things,
40:36
they’re almost sort of expected.
40:39
Obviously, there’s much further we have to go.
40:41
I think a lot more sports figures should be coming out,
40:46
because of the visibility thing.
40:51
Gay people are a lot less trivialized.
40:56
It still is frustrating because so many of the people that do, end
41:00
up the most—in the public eye—are because they are extreme, in a sense.
41:08
Like Bruce Jenner, who’s now—I can’t even remember her name now—one of the
41:18
more notable trans figures right now.
41:21
Caitlyn.
41:22
Caitlyn Jenner, yes, thank you.
41:25
Nothing against her, but she’s sort of this extreme person who’s a republican
41:29
and there’s all this wackiness and
41:34
reality TV kind of crap that goes on with it.
41:36
I wish that more people would just be like gay-after-the-fact.
41:42
“I am this person and I’m also gay.” And everyone’s guilty of it. People still
41:47
say “oh, my best gay friend” or whatever.
41:49
It’s a word that I think comes too soon in the conversation.
41:53
I’d rather be like “after the fact.” Instead of saying “oh, my black friend,
41:59
so and so,” it’s like “my friend, so and so.” That information isn’t pertinent.
42:03
It’s not relative.
42:04
It doesn’t help define the person at all, just leave that word out if you would.
42:08
And I wish that we would get more there a little bit more quickly with
42:14
sexuality, because it’s just silly.
42:16
It doesn’t really mean anything.
42:19
It’s like saying “my straight friend, so and so.” What do you get from that?
42:23
Anything more than “my gay friend”?
42:25
Maybe, maybe not.
42:29
Taking it back, you talked about how your brother was also gay.
42:35
Were you guys close?
42:35
Did you guys ever talk about sexuality?
42:38
When we were little, we didn’t really speak at all.
42:40
We didn’t have much of a relationship although we shared
42:43
the same group of friends.
42:44
It’s hard to explain, but it’s just how we were.
42:46
We did not get along as kids.
42:50
And I had been out for about two years or so in Corvallis.
42:56
He had moved back to Seattle with my parents for a bit
43:00
and came down to visit me.
43:05
We were friendly with each other.
43:06
We weren’t close at this time.
43:11
But he said he wanted to come down and talk to me.
43:13
And I said “Oh yeah, sure. Come on down.” He would come down
43:17
and visit every now and again.
43:18
We weren’t estranged.
43:19
And
43:21
he said “Well, your big brother’s in love.” And I said, “What’s his name?”
43:26
[Laughs] Because I knew exactly that he was coming down to come out to me.
43:29
And he was so pissed.
43:31
He was so mad because I totally took this away from this.
43:36
That was really the first time that we ever really talked about it.
43:39
When I came out to the family, he was super supportive and super
43:43
proud of me, and told my parents, “I think diversity is a good thing.
43:47
It just adds more flavor to life.”
43:51
There was no pushback from him at all.
43:54
He was totally supportive.
43:55
I think he was a little frustrated that I had come out before him.
43:58
But everyone takes their own time.
44:02
He eventually came out, shortly after that, to my parents as well.
44:08
When did you meet your partner?
44:11
I met Chris about ten years ago.
44:15
This spring will be ten years.
44:19
Hadn’t really dated at all in Corvallis.
44:23
No one could ever seem to find anyone to set me up with.
44:26
Internet dating just didn’t exist in any real sense.
44:33
It’s hard to explain.
44:35
I would have just really, tragically terrible dates, just awful.
44:40
I remember a very typical moment.
44:43
Went on a date with a fellow who drove up from Eugene.
44:45
And of course, he wasn’t anything like his photograph.
44:48
He was one the most miserable people I had ever met.
44:51
I met him at Starbucks.
44:52
He told me, within ten minutes of talking to him, what order
44:56
hoped his parents would die in.
44:58
I’ll never forget it.
44:59
He was just like “God, I just can’t stand my dad. I sure hope
45:01
he dies first.” It was so surreal.
45:05
I was like “Oh my god.” There’s no possibility for a second date
45:10
after a conversation that that.
45:12
That was basically my dating life in a nutshell.
45:15
Other than that, I had lots of affairs with straight men.
45:21
I bonded really easily and really intimately with a lot
45:28
of straight guys—it’s college.
45:31
And
45:35
I developed relationships with them, a couple in particular, that
45:41
ended up crossing physical lines.
45:43
I usually would fall deeply in love.
45:46
It was difficult for them too because they weren’t really, necessarily
45:50
physically oriented that way.
45:52
But their emotions would get the better of them because I was
45:55
sort of a mother figure in a way.
45:59
I took care of things with them that the other straight guys didn’t do.
46:01
I cooked and I did house cleaning and whatever, where the other guys just
46:06
would leave beer cans everywhere—I don’t know, I’m not making any sense.
46:09
[Laughs] But, I had some pretty intense relationships with people that were
46:15
essentially—it was going to go nowhere.
46:17
But it just was what it was, no regrets at all.
46:22
But just there weren’t any gay men to date.
46:26
So,
46:28
when I met Chris,
46:32
I don’t know, it’s sort of like we just skipped straight from dating to marriage.
46:35
We pretty much figured out that we were a good fit.
46:40
And we’ve been married now going on seven years.
46:46
It’s pretty kickass.
46:47
It was weird.
46:48
I went from absolutely no experience in relationships, other than these
46:53
confused things, to an incredibly stable, healthy adult relationship overnight.
47:02
Did you, with the relationships with straight men, have to be super
47:11
secretive about it?
47:12
Was it dangerous, in a sense?
47:12
I was secretive about it out of just respect for them.
47:16
It wasn’t anything that we were going to make public.
47:21
A few of our friends would catch on and think it was pretty funny that we would
47:26
come back from camping together and we’d be wearing each other’s clothes.
47:29
I’d be wearing his pants, he’d be wearing my pants, whatever.
47:31
They were like, “Hmm.
47:32
What’s that about?”
47:35
But yeah, it wasn’t anything that was really public.
47:38
And it didn’t need to be.
47:40
I didn’t really, necessarily want it or need it to be, because it
47:43
wasn’t any relationship that I knew was supposed to be or going to be.
47:46
It just was what it was.
47:48
It was just really an intense friendship.
47:50
That’s how I looked at it.
47:51
I didn’t look at it as dating at all.
47:58
Throughout college, did
48:03
you ever second guess doing activism in the beginning?
48:05
Any
48:09
regrets or anything like that?
48:11
No, none.
48:14
I don’t know why I never second-guessed it.
48:17
It just, like I said, seemed really imperative to me.
48:19
It’s something I had to do.
48:23
I’m not really a political person by nature.
48:26
I’m not a fighter.
48:27
I don’t like conflict.
48:30
But for me, it just seemed like something that I really had to do.
48:34
And from that first meeting in the Women’s Center, it just was what it was.
48:44
I don’t really recall being proud of it at the time.
48:50
I don’t remember really being conflicted by it.
48:53
I remember my heart racing when I would go into my class after the paper had come
48:58
out, and see people reading it and looking over at me like, “Oh dude, oh my god.”
49:06
So, that was intense.
49:07
And wondering around feeling like everyone knew who I was in this
49:10
campus, where I used to be just completely anonymous, was odd.
49:15
It was really strange, because all of a sudden I was this public figure,
49:18
which I never really wanted to be.
49:20
But it just seemed like it was important.
49:23
I don’t even think I understood how important it was at the time.
49:28
It certainly has come to mean a lot more to me now than it did then.
49:35
When did you guys kind of end?
49:37
After you guys graduated, was that when it ended?
49:39
Or, when you took a break, was that when it ended?
49:43
For the most part.
49:44
I went off to LBCC and never had a thought of doing anything
49:50
there, as far as activism.
49:56
I don’t remember choosing or thinking of walking away from it at the time.
50:02
Derek and Julie and I had kind of grown apart as it was, not purposefully,
50:07
but we just went different directions.
50:09
Where
50:13
I ended up at LBCC, I was out.
50:16
Nobody gave a crap about it when I was at school.
50:19
It was a nonissue.
50:22
No one thought anything of it.
50:23
It just was.
50:25
I had
50:29
always meant to come back to OSU and check in, and see what things were like here.
50:36
I left OSU in ’97, and I meant to come back and see, but it just felt weird.
50:47
There were, sometimes, some older gay men who would come into meetings and
50:53
we always felt like we had to protect the young kids from them, in a way.
50:56
And I didn’t want to be looked at as that creepy old guy who’s coming
51:00
in to scoop someone up or something.
51:04
So, I never did.
51:05
I never bothered.
51:06
And I never really felt like
51:09
it would matter if I came in or not.
51:11
I didn’t think anyone would remember anything we did.
51:17
College is so transitional.
51:18
People come and they go.
51:19
And no one at OSU now, except for Mina Carson, was here when I was here.
51:27
So, what happened, the whole reason that we’re all sitting here
51:30
today, all this time had gone by.
51:34
I never left town.
51:36
I really enjoyed being here.
51:37
Corvallis suits me well.
51:39
Found a husband and bought a small farm.
51:42
Found a really good life here.
51:44
And I ended up hiring a young woman named Miriam.
51:51
She had worked for me for a couple of weeks, she was working in my kitchen.
51:57
One night, it was just the two of us—I was sitting at my bar doing some paperwork—she
52:02
came and asked me if it’d be ok if she came in late the next day, cuz she
52:09
was going to go advocate for some funding for some mental health issues.
52:12
And I was like “Oh, absolutely. That’s a killer.
52:14
Of course, you can come in late anytime you need to do something like that.
52:17
That’s amazing.”
52:17
I didn’t know anything about what she did at OSU.
52:21
So I asked her, and she said it was for the Queer Resources Center.
52:26
The way it works is you got to in and ask for it, or you’re not going get it back.
52:30
So, if you don’t show up to ask where this funding is, it doesn’t exist anymore.
52:33
So she was just doing that and being proactive.
52:35
And I was like, "Oh, that’s so cool!” I was like “I used to do stuff like
52:39
that in the middle ‘90s at OSU.” She was like “Oh, really?” I was like,
52:44
“I used to be in queer politics and
52:49
help developed the campus gay alliance”, which it wasn’t called back then.
52:54
And she looked at me in this funny way, and her eyes got really wide.
52:57
She’s like “Oh my god, really?” I was like “Yeah.
52:59
It was a long time ago.
53:02
But it was something I’m proud of.” And she’s like, “I know who you are.”
53:08
And this light went off in her head. It actually brought me to tears. She
53:11
was like “No, no, you don’t understand.
53:13
We know you.
53:15
I can’t believe I work for you.” She hadn’t put it together either.
53:18
She’s like, “Oh my god.
53:18
Oh my god.
53:18
Oh my god.” And she’s like “I’ve got to get you in there.
53:20
I can’t wait to go in and tell everybody that I work for you.” And I was like
53:23
“What?!” I was totally blown away, because I had just thought who the hell
53:28
would ever remember any of that stuff?
53:29
She’s kind of like “What you’re doing now is really cool.”
53:34
And again, it came back like full circle.
53:36
All of a sudden, I got to relive these moments.
53:39
I got a hold of Julie and Derek, and told them.
53:43
And they were blown away.
53:44
They were like, “Oh my god, really?” I was like “Yeah, they totally know who we are!
53:47
Can you believe this?” So, it spurred this whole thing where we all
53:52
came back and donated stuff to the archives and got to tell our stories.
53:57
Essentially, it was Miriam who brought us back into here, and then told us
54:01
that we’re still relevant, which is so cool and, honestly, really blew me away.
54:06
So, I owe it to Miriam.
54:08
From what you know, has the activism in the queer community at OSU declined?
54:14
I don’t think it’s anything like what it was.
54:15
I really can’t even imagine that it is anything like it was.
54:22
But again, I’m really not that educated.
54:25
I don’t know what goes on here.
54:28
I’m blown away by the funding that is.
54:31
I’m blown away by the diversity that is.
54:36
Julie and Derek and I had no idea what exists at OSU now.
54:42
Our budget was like $600 for the year.
54:45
We just used it to make really aggressive posters.
54:49
That was really about it.
54:50
Now it’s in the thousands what you guys get to work with—I don’t mean
54:54
to say you guys—but with the Queer Resources Center it has, it’s just
54:59
infinitely beyond what we did.
55:01
So that, in a sense, is amazing.
55:05
It’s much more an official thing.
55:07
We were sort of a fringe group that was just tolerated.
55:12
And now, I think, what’s going on on campus is much more on par with any other
55:20
center, any other group that is here.
55:25
Did you, Julie, and Derek ever contact each other after
55:30
college, things like that?
55:31
Hardly.
55:32
We ran into each other once really randomly.
55:38
But that was quite a few years ago, and it was when Derek was
55:41
just starting to transition.
55:43
We always meant to reconnect, but it’s just how life works.
55:47
They were up in Portland, and I’m down here, and in a very different existence.
55:53
We’re really stoked that we have reconnected now and we talk pretty often.
55:58
It’s meant a lot to me, especially between Derek and I because we were
56:03
always sort of boyfriends back then.
56:05
It’s just cute.
56:07
We adored each other.
56:07
And
56:10
I’m really proud of that friendship.
56:14
Derek is one of the most powerful people I’ve ever met in my life.
56:17
To be able to still be in touch with him is amazing.
56:21
I just love it.
56:22
And again, I owe it to Miriam cuz it just brought this whole thing about.
56:27
How long have you stayed in Corvallis?
56:29
Since ’93.
56:31
Have you ever planned on leaving?
56:34
No.
56:36
Never had much of an intent to go anywhere else.
56:39
I lived a little bit with my parents in Seattle in between.
56:43
But Corvallis just suited me.
56:47
I fell into a group of friends that’s incredibly stable and supportive.
56:52
And they’re kind of my everything.
56:55
I think if you’re in this town and you have the right group
56:56
of friends, it’s just perfect.
56:59
I don’t miss big city life at all.
57:00
I got enough of that when I was a kid in Texas.
57:05
It’s not everything, but Corvallis is incredibly comfortable.
57:09
Obviously being married, with a mortgage and all off that kind of seals that deal.
57:14
Has the climate changed with time?
57:17
What would you say the climate is now towards queer people?
57:22
It’s certainly better.
57:23
I don’t think anyone bats an eye at me, at least.
57:27
And
57:30
I’m pretty blown away.
57:34
Like I was saying, when I first got here and I would see someone who’s African
57:36
American, I’d be awkwardly staring.
57:40
And now when I see out trans kids or gender-non-conforming
57:44
kids and adults, I love it.
57:49
To me, it’s just like seeing an openly Muslim person.
57:53
Any bit of diversity, I think, is just really thing for this town.
57:57
This town is hungry for it, in a way.
58:01
To me, that’s an improvement.
58:05
I never want to focus too much on improvements because there’s still so
58:09
much more to go, so much further to go.
58:12
I think Corvallis is a wonderful little bubble.
58:16
But you know it when you leave here.
58:18
We have it pretty good as far as things go.
58:21
As far as tolerance and acceptance, I think Corvallis is pretty
58:27
awesome for what it could be.
58:31
But again, we have ways to go, always.
58:34
Do you and your husband ever get weird looks or anything?
58:38
No comments?
58:40
No.
58:42
He’s taller than me.
58:43
He’s got this big beard.
58:44
And we’re both very passing
58:53
people.
58:53
And I think that’s really it.
58:56
People just don’t think anything of you just because of that.
59:02
Is there anything in the future that you’re looking forward to?
59:05
Any things like that?
59:08
I’d like to be more present on campus.
59:10
Like I said, I’m really flattered to be a part of this.
59:14
It means a lot to me that what we went through back then really
59:18
mattered and did something.
59:23
I love sharing the history of it, because it’s just really cool to me.
59:30
It’s really cool that people care and actually want to know.
59:35
So yeah, in the future, any time that there’s a need for a speaker or a panel
59:40
or anything, I’d love to be here to share.
59:42
That’s cool.
59:45
I love it.
59:46
Awesome.
59:46
Anything else that you’d like to talk about, bring back up?
59:58
Not really.
1:00:03
More to speak about the Avengers.
1:00:05
Really, again, I can’t say enough.
1:00:08
When you were asking about the activism today, I couldn’t
1:00:11
imagine that it is anything of the brilliance that they carried.
1:00:17
It was just remarkable.
1:00:20
This incredible blend of humor and intelligence.
1:00:25
It was just so smart, what they did.
1:00:32
I’m still blown away by the intelligent action that they
1:00:36
carried out with everything.
1:00:38
It was just righteous.
1:00:40
They saw what needed to happen and they came to task like superheroes.
1:00:45
They just did it.
1:00:47
Weren’t afraid at all.
1:00:52
Just reliving all of the activism that they did, that’s just so cool.
1:00:58
It’s amazing, all the tapas events.
1:01:00
And this sexual liberty that they carried out
1:01:09
was not something that I had any experience or understanding of.
1:01:17
The way that they were really true to their core of any
1:01:23
sort of sexuality is good.
1:01:25
It’s all awesome.
1:01:28
They celebrated everybody.
1:01:30
And while they were by definition a lesbian activism group,
1:01:37
they happily accepted anybody.
1:01:43
Like I said, there weren’t men present, but if there had been a man’s thing,
1:01:47
it probably would not have been as inclusive as the Avengers were.
1:01:51
The Avengers were anything queer, and the queerer, the better.
1:01:57
It really allowed them to speak for everybody
1:02:01
in a really awesome way.
1:02:03
I wish it still existed.
1:02:04
It was so fun.
1:02:06
So you, being a gay men, just felt like you’re part of it no matter what?
1:02:10
Oh yeah.
1:02:11
Didn’t care.
1:02:13
I didn’t feel like an other to them at all.
1:02:15
But again, I didn’t want to insert myself into their functions because I respected
1:02:20
them as, usually, a group of women.
1:02:23
It wasn’t really my place to be like “Yay, I’m an Avenger.”
1:02:28
It never would have occurred to me to call myself an Avenger at that time.
1:02:32
What was your favorite activist movement that you guys did?
1:02:36
Or event?
1:02:40
I wasn’t a part of it, but when they went to the basketball game
1:02:47
and were advocating for the women on the team that were on the verge of coming out.
1:03:00
They were star players.
1:03:01
Boky was amazing.
1:03:04
There were several that were incredible.
1:03:05
But I was really taken with Boky.
1:03:07
She was all that and more.
1:03:12
Their coach was telling them to suppress their identity and to not be out.
1:03:17
“Don’t be out.
1:03:18
Don’t cause any—don’t talk about your girlfriend.
1:03:21
Don’t get photo’d in public.” And this was coming from a lesbian
1:03:24
woman who was just deeply closeted.
1:03:28
They wanted to rattle that cage.
1:03:30
They did it really effectively.
1:03:31
They went and rolled out banners at the game.
1:03:33
And at the time, we had a really incredible women’s basketball team.
1:03:39
It
1:03:48
was very public what they would do.
1:03:51
You can imagine going into that arena that’s packed with people
1:03:56
and unfurling this big banner that says “Lesbians Love Beavs” was just
1:04:06
pretty intense, pretty thrilling.
1:04:08
It was aggressive, but it was necessary.
1:04:12
It was a good thing to start that conversation the way they did.
1:04:16
And it helped the people all around there, because that stadium was half full of
1:04:21
lesbian women at the time, I’m quite sure.
1:04:28
Just to be visible, to speak up, was really cool.
1:04:31
That probably was my favorite of what they did.
1:04:33
A lot of them were just really scary,
1:04:39
maybe not as fun as that one.
1:04:42
So that’s why that one would be my favorite.
1:04:48
Were you ever involved in one that you were scared doing or anything like that?
1:04:54
The only ones I was really involved with were just when we would be in
1:04:58
the quad and doing the fire-reading thing and passing out condoms.
1:05:06
But that was more so, for me, just a part of the LGBA thing that I was doing.
1:05:17
Just having people walk by, these parents that were bring their kids to campus
1:05:22
for the very first time and you could tell they were touring the school and
1:05:25
they were walking through the campus.
1:05:27
And here’s these gays in the middle and just covering their eyes
1:05:30
and “Oh my gosh, I don’t know if we’d bring this kid here. Argh.”
1:05:35
That could be pretty intense.
1:05:39
But I wasn’t really a part of any of the ones that I think were really scary.
1:05:42
They went to one—I can’t remember the name of the group—.
1:05:47
And it was a basically a Christian conservative men’s group that
1:05:51
they went and sort of infiltrated this giant stadium in Eugene, and
1:05:59
got politely asked to leave and escorted out.
1:06:03
That would have been too scary for me.
1:06:06
But, yeah.
1:06:08
If you were to go back, would you join those?
1:06:13
Like would you have done the crazier ones?
1:06:14
Absolutely.
1:06:15
Yeah, now I would.
1:06:16
At the time, I kind of had my own life and my own distractions.
1:06:22
And again, I didn’t really view myself as an Avenger.
1:06:25
I lived with them.
1:06:30
But now, absolutely.
1:06:32
Yeah, absolutely.
1:06:35
And throughout college, doing keynote speaking, future
1:06:39
things you wish would happen.
1:06:42
What would you wish to see change in the US right now, towards different
1:06:48
minority groups and whatnot?
1:06:54
I think we still need to move past classifying and
1:06:58
defining people in general.
1:07:03
It’s just weird that we’re still doing it.
1:07:05
Bathroom bills and whatnot are just absolutely ridiculous.
1:07:10
If anything, they’re just a distraction just to get the people “Look over here,
1:07:14
look over here! Trans people.” And meanwhile, all these other stuff is
1:07:19
happening that no one’s even noticing because they’re being distracted. I
1:07:21
think it’s just a matter of distraction.
1:07:24
I wish we would move away from that.
1:07:28
Really, I think it’s much ado about nothing.
1:07:32
If someone identifies as a certain way and then later on changes their
1:07:36
mind, it really is no one’s business.
1:07:40
No one owes anyone their identity.
1:07:47
I wish we would just look at people as human beings, and just start moving
1:07:52
past color or gender, all of it.
1:07:55
It’s sort of pointless to keep dividing people up into more and more categories.
1:08:00
It is important that people still be vocal about who they are
1:08:07
and stand up as a trans person, and stand up as a gay man, and stand up as a
1:08:12
non-conforming person, however it may be.
1:08:15
Just add that diversity to life.
1:08:17
But those definitions shouldn’t come as the first word in defining somebody or
1:08:21
talking about somebody, like I was saying “my black friend Sarah” or whatever.
1:08:27
Just annoying.
1:08:29
Do you think that activism, like Lesbian Avengers, the way they took things, if
1:08:36
someone do that now, what do you think the public reaction would be to it?
1:08:39
I have no idea.
1:08:42
Somewhat the same.
1:08:44
I think there are a lot of things that haven’t changed that much.
1:08:48
They used to ride bikes topless through town, which was hilarious.
1:08:53
It was just so funny.
1:08:54
And, again, it was comedy but it was also making a point, like “why is the female
1:08:59
breast such an issue.” I don’t think that we’ve evolved from that at all. People
1:09:05
still flip out about women breastfeeding in public. So, I’m not sure that issue
1:09:10
has necessarily changed all that much.
1:09:12
And if they were to reform and ride their bikes topless through
1:09:16
town, they probably would have the same reaction that they had then.
1:09:20
Probably would be the exact same thing, I would imagine.
1:09:23
Unfurling
1:09:27
banner at the basketball game, maybe not important anymore?
1:09:32
Maybe not so much?
1:09:33
I’m not sure.
1:09:36
Now, with future things do you think that if someone—how do you put this.
1:09:51
I
1:09:57
lost it.
1:10:02
Let’s just take it back to a random sidenote.
1:10:05
During the AIDS epidemic—in the ‘80s, right—did that ever carry
1:10:12
over, or were you ever aware of it when you were younger?
1:10:16
Absolutely.
1:10:18
I grew up in a period where my adolescence was when AIDS was coming to light.
1:10:25
And Ryan White was a big issue.
1:10:28
He was a hemophiliac kid who got it through a blood transfusion.
1:10:33
And
1:10:35
they didn’t want him in the school.
1:10:37
He went through all this hell of being looked at as this terrible thing.
1:10:44
His family was getting death threats and all that.
1:10:46
A very marginalized kid who was otherwise just a little kid.
1:10:53
I remember that really well.
1:10:54
But there was so much more misinformation at that point.
1:10:57
It was still being promoted as a gay disease, and that it was God’s way of
1:11:06
correcting the gay issue, if you would.
1:11:09
When I was little, I remember being really afraid when I got sick,
1:11:13
because I figured maybe I had AIDS.
1:11:15
I didn’t want to go to the doctor because then they’d find out that I was gay.
1:11:19
And this whole thing would unravel.
1:11:20
It’s hard to imagine now—it seems so silly.
1:11:25
But kids live with crazy little fears.
1:11:27
I remember that being very real to me because I knew I was a gay kid.
1:11:32
And I figured that I would get AIDS just because I was having
1:11:35
impure thoughts about me.
1:11:38
That’s all that I understood: gay people got AIDS and I’m gay,
1:11:42
so I’m probably going to get it and it would be my punishment.
1:11:46
Which is a terrible thing for a little kid to live with.
1:11:52
Unfortunately, like Corvallis,
1:11:58
we did a lot to promote safer sex.
1:12:03
We were constantly passing out condoms and dental dams and whatnot, and talking
1:12:09
about it, trying to educate people about it, trying to make it known that
1:12:15
it isn’t really just a gay disease.
1:12:18
And again, the Avengers were amazing at that safer sex kind of activism.
1:12:26
But it wasn’t really something that was talked about.
1:12:29
At the time, it was probably more of an urban issue.
1:12:32
I remember going to the doctor to get tested.
1:12:35
And my doctor was like “Oh AIDS doesn’t really exist here.
1:12:38
You don’t need to worry about this.” My doctor almost talked me out of getting
1:12:42
tested for it because he didn’t think that it was an issue in Corvallis.
1:12:48
And that sort of strikes me as like “Okay.” I still went ahead
1:12:53
and did it because I was about to enter a relationship with somebody.
1:12:56
I just wanted the paperwork.
1:12:58
That’s just the proper way of if you’re going to be in a relationship
1:13:00
with somebody, and you’re not going to have protective sex, it
1:13:04
should come through paperwork.
1:13:05
So,
1:13:08
that’s why I did it.
1:13:09
I wasn’t worried about having HIV because I really hadn’t that much of
1:13:14
any sexual experience and certainly nothing that was risky at the time.
1:13:19
But just good to know your status.
1:13:22
But again, HIV education and awareness is still sort of, especially at the time, was
1:13:30
something that was just nonexistent here.
1:13:33
And did you ever continue with religion?
1:13:36
Or, after high school, did that just leave?
1:13:40
Not really.
1:13:42
I didn’t go to church when I came here.
1:13:47
I don’t really question my faith.
1:13:49
I don’t necessarily have faith.
1:13:50
I don’t not have faith.
1:13:52
I’m
1:13:56
quite comfortable with how I view my spirituality.
1:14:01
But I’ve never continued with it in any sort of organized manner.
1:14:08
And we’ll just kind of go over again.
1:14:12
Anything else you have that you would like to bring up?
1:14:16
Do you think we’ve covered most of what you would like to say?
1:14:27
Yeah, I guess so.
1:14:30
I wish I had a better memory.
1:14:32
When Derek and Julie and I got together and were talking about this, we
1:14:37
couldn’t remember dates or anything.
1:14:41
It’s been twenty-something years, which is crazy to me.
1:14:45
If it weren’t for the scrapbooks, I wouldn’t remember much of any of it.
1:14:51
It’s kind of a blur in a sense.
1:14:53
And I was a really sober person at the time.
1:14:56
So, I don’t even have that to blame it on.
1:15:02
But, yeah.
1:15:04
It’s neat to see the evolution that has happened here at OSU.
1:15:07
I’m still excited to learn more about
1:15:11
what’s done and the diversity that is now part of this campus, as
1:15:16
far as queer awareness, it’s cool.
1:15:19
I can’t believe how far it’s come from when we were here, working with dimes.
1:15:29
I don’t have much else, I don’t think.
1:15:32
Alright.
1:15:33
I guess we’ll just end the video.
1:15:36
Awesome.
