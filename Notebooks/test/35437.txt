00:02
What we’re really interested in, Bill, is a history of your life.
00:06
Can you start out by telling us something, telling us about your childhood?
00:11
Where you were born, what kind of family you were living with, in?
00:18
Just kind of start from the beginning and let us get some idea.
00:24
Do I start with once upon a time?
00:26
[Smiles]
00:26
. Sure!
00:28
Alright, I was born in Portland, 1937, the first Black to be born, Wilcox
00:35
Memorial, Good Samaritan Hospital.
00:40
Dr. [unclear] delivered me.
00:42
I
00:45
went to schools in Portland.
00:47
I went to Highland Grade School.
00:49
My dad had gone to Highland Grade School.
00:51
His brother had gone to Highland Grade School.
00:55
They’ve change the name of Highland School to Martin Luther King Grade School.
01:04
I went to Jefferson High School one year.
01:06
My dad went to Jefferson High School one year.
01:08
I had the same English teacher he had, and I came out of high school in 1954.
01:14
I came to Eugene to go to school.
01:18
I wasn’t there a year and a half, and I went into the service.
01:21
There’s probably some other things about my life that nobody cares about.
01:26
Well, let’s go back a little bit to your family.
01:30
Did you have siblings?
01:32
What was your early family life like in terms of
01:43
who you lived with?
01:45
Who took care of you?
01:46
Basically, the neighborhood I grew up in, when I grew up
01:49
there, was basically German.
01:53
World War II a lot of the German people became Irish, and they were garbagemen.
02:00
My brother, my sister, myself—I’m the oldest.
02:04
We were raised in the same house, in different neighborhoods, though.
02:08
By the time my sister came along, 10 years later, the
02:10
neighborhood was basically Black.
02:14
We don’t have a whole lot to talk about in that regard for us, because I was
02:18
gone by the time she was coming up.
02:20
The neighborhood, I don’t know how to—whether you’re talking about the
02:24
social part the neighborhood, the racial part of the neighborhood?
02:32
Portland, Oregon, raised one child at a time.
02:36
My brother was 5 years younger than I am.
02:37
My sister’s 5 years younger than that.
02:40
My brother, Earl,
02:44
he was kind of a sick little kid.
02:47
He didn’t really run with me, because I was 5 years older, you know?
02:55
We, as a family, we were really living in my grandfather’s house.
02:59
He was still alive.
03:00
He was a barber.
03:03
He had a shop, until ’34 and then he was working on somebody else’s shop.
03:11
My dad at that time worked on the railroad.
03:12
He was a waiter on a railroad, on a streamliner, as a matter
03:15
of fact, going to Chicago.
03:18
He would bring back records that were popular in Chicago.
03:21
They hadn’t gotten to Portland yet.
03:27
I just went to a regular grade school.
03:29
Basically, there were 9 Black kids in the school.
03:33
There were close to 500, 600 kids in the school.
03:36
Now, I’m talking about basically before World War II.
03:40
At the end of the war, because a lot of people came to Portland
03:43
to work the shipyards, a lot of them were in the northeast.
03:46
By that time, it was definitely more—the neighborhood was
03:49
starting to change by that time.
03:53
By the time I went away to high school—I started high school, I was 5’1”.
03:56
Even the stairs were too big, and there were people in high school
03:59
that looked like adults to me.
04:02
I went to Jefferson one year, and then I transferred to Benson because
04:07
I want to think I wanted to be an architect.
04:10
They had architectural drawing there, and I did that.
04:14
We didn’t have AutoCAD in those days.
04:16
You had pencils and rulers and straight-edges, T-squares.
04:22
I wasn’t big enough to be an athlete, but I ended up being a musician.
04:27
I don’t know, I’m really kind of stuck here on where you want me to go.
04:33
Well, let’s go back, again.
04:36
Okay.
04:36
When you were
04:39
a child, when you were younger, when you were in primary school you
04:44
were saying that there were only about 9 Black kids in the school.
04:48
That’s exactly right.
04:49
Correct.
04:49
So,
04:52
how were you treated?
04:53
Was there any difficulty in making friends?
04:56
What was—?
04:57
Not in school.
05:00
No, grade school was fine.
05:02
The church my folks went to was not in the neighborhood where we lived.
05:06
I went to a Black church, AME, a Methodist church.
05:13
There was a certain hierarchy in the church, but that’s a whole
05:16
other kind of—you’re a scientist.
05:18
You know about those kind of... and I would say my parents basically
05:22
were, I would say Easter Christians.
05:26
My grandfather went to church a lot.
05:28
My parents only went a couple times a year.
05:32
I think basically I was treated okay.
05:36
My parents were kind of influential in the city, so there was a certain amount
05:41
of attitude from a lot of people about my family, because they had been in
05:46
Portland so long, and they’re kind of prominent citizens in the neighborhood.
05:51
No, no—in the community, not in the neighborhood.
05:57
I have a hard time comparing my life with a lot of other people I knew at the time.
06:03
Why is that?
06:06
Because the family had been there so much longer than a lot of other people.
06:11
I didn’t get along that well at home,
06:17
because I wanted to get out in the street and my parents
06:19
didn’t really appreciate that.
06:23
When I was a high school student I started playing music.
06:27
I can’t really talk about the house, because it wasn’t that big of a deal.
06:30
That’s just where we lived.
06:32
That’s how we lived.
06:36
When you were saying that your parents were prominent people in the community,
06:40
can you tell us more about that?
06:42
Well, let me—it’s easier to say is my folks were really involved in the
06:47
NAACP in the late ‘40s into the ‘50s.
06:52
They were trying to pass legislation in Oregon about fair
06:55
employment, fair housing: FEPC.
06:58
I got out of high school my junior year to go to Salem and watch them vote.
07:03
Senator Hatfield was one of the sponsors of the bill.
07:06
That’s before he went east.
07:08
That’s before he was a governor.
07:11
We were in the galley, what do you call upstairs
07:15
in the city, state government?
07:17
I don’t know.
07:17
We clapped for all the professionals when they did pass it.
07:24
Black entertainers, or people of importance, come to the
07:29
city and they start staying in the hotels and not in homes.
07:33
I mentioned before, I think, Louis Armstrong came in 1947, he came
07:38
to play in Portland, at a concert, and he couldn’t stay in a hotel.
07:42
He had to stay in someone’s home.
07:44
He gave the person who, he gave them a trumpet for letting him stay there.
07:50
As far as a household’s concerned, basically my grandfather kind of decided
07:54
how things went because it was his house.
07:58
I don’t know if these are the kind of things you want to know?
07:59
Yeah, go ahead.
08:03
He was a Victorian.
08:04
I mean, he was a small man and the world had to pay for it.
08:11
He didn’t look at all like his brother.
08:13
My grandfather looked like a little Jew: straight hair, straight—his
08:18
brothers were big, dark, and muscular.
08:23
My dad was much bigger than his dad, so I don’t know.
08:26
As far as the family’s concerned, our neighbors basically were white.
08:30
They sent me to preschool to a Catholic school up the street.
08:34
When I came back sounding like up there they took me
08:37
out and I went somewhere else.
08:38
I went to, well, I went on to grade school, Highland.
08:44
I don’t know—I was a kid.
08:47
I was just another kid in the neighborhood.
08:49
There were some issues if I went other places, that’s true.
08:52
Blacks could not go to Jantzen Beach and swim.
08:56
Bands would come, they couldn’t—Black people couldn’t go to bands there.
09:02
That’s the way the city was set up.
09:03
It’s still that way in a lot of respects.
09:06
I seem to be losing my voice... Am I
09:13
alright?
09:15
Okay.
09:17
The neighborhood, we didn’t have a lot of racial problems in the neighborhood
09:21
because basically my folks, my dad and his brothers they ended up fighting every day.
09:28
There were issues to begin with, but it never got any worse.
09:31
What
09:34
were those issues to begin with?
09:36
They got called a bunch of names.
09:38
Because
09:41
a lot of the kids were, their parents had come to the states after World War
09:48
I, there were, in the neighborhood there were, as I said, Germans
09:52
and there were Latvians, a few Greeks, and a lot of Scandinavians.
09:58
I played with the kids next door, which were Swedish, basically.
10:04
When we did something wrong, we got hit.
10:06
Kids were kids.
10:08
They didn’t have—nobody said anything else.
10:09
You mess up, you got hit [chuckles]
10:15
. What about your parents?
10:17
From what I understand your mother, part of her life was staying home
10:21
and taking care of the children.
10:23
That’s exactly right.
10:24
Was she friends with the neighbors?
10:26
Yes.
10:27
With the other mothers?
10:27
Yes, the other mothers around, yes she was.
10:31
We had neighbors down the corner that were Black, and we knew them.
10:36
I was small for my age.
10:38
I never got much bigger, and for me I was really light-complected.
10:43
That’s a whole other issue.
10:43
I’m not even going to get into that, okay?
10:47
Because that’s a whole discussion unto itself.
10:50
Anybody who’s going to see the program, knows what that means.
10:53
Anybody who doesn’t know what it means, they’re not going
10:54
to get it if I tell them.
10:57
Because we’re going to the—that’s a whole other discussion.
11:02
It didn’t really apply that much to me in grade school.
11:06
In the seventh grade we had dancing,
11:11
ball room dancing and square dancing and all that stuff.
11:15
I was just another kid in the class.
11:17
But, when I got to high school, I ended up going to a boy’s school,
11:21
so that wasn’t an issue anymore.
11:24
Racially, in the neighborhood it was okay.
11:29
My brother would have probably married a girl across the street, if my
11:32
brother would have allowed his kids to be married in Catholic school.
11:39
The old man across the street, he didn’t care what color my brother was, but he
11:42
wanted his grandkids in Catholic school.
11:44
That was a rub.
11:46
That’s a different kind of an issue.
11:51
As far as my sister’s concerned, I said she was grown.
11:54
She grew up in a different neighborhood, even though it’s the same house.
11:59
So, describe that.
12:06
My sister would always like to think she was Angela Davis.
12:10
That goes somewhere else altogether.
12:13
My sister didn’t care for my wife or my family or me.
12:16
That’s fine.
12:16
That’s her call.
12:18
I had more problem with that in my own house than I did in the neighborhood.
12:23
To this day.
12:26
As I said, if you interview her, you wouldn’t think we
12:29
were related in any respect.
12:32
That’s fine.
12:32
That’s her call.
12:35
So, I didn’t really know my sister because she’s 10 years younger than I am.
12:41
I was gone by the time she was up
12:46
and around.
12:46
That’s basically the family stuff.
12:49
What else can I tell you about that?
12:51
It’s not very interesting stuff, you know?
12:55
My folks drove big cars and wore nice clothes.
13:01
So, while you were a child you started playing music?
13:05
Yes.
13:06
I took piano lessons.
13:10
I learned to play, you start with things like “Bill Grogan’s Goat,” or
13:14
whatever it was, and “Blue Bells of Scotland.” I took piano for a couple
13:18
of years, and then I was playing baseball and my hands would be swollen.
13:22
The teacher would come and I didn’t practice, so that stopped music.
13:26
There was always music in the house.
13:29
There was jazz music in the house, but there was also
13:31
classical music in the house.
13:34
They used to have a radio program called “Piano Playhouse.” Do you remember that?
13:39
It was classical.
13:40
Then they would bring in somebody who played other styles of music.
13:45
There was music in the house all the time.
13:47
My father tried to play piano some.
13:49
He thought he was Earl Hines or somebody, but he wasn’t.
13:56
My grandfather had been a drummer when he was a young
13:58
man, but that was all Two Beat.
14:00
Yes, there was music in the house.
14:02
There was art in the house.
14:07
When you, again, go back a little bit, but when you were in school,
14:13
so you went to a boy’s school?
14:15
How come, was it a private school?
14:18
It was technical high school.
14:19
A technical high school.
14:23
City wide.
14:24
And that school had Blacks and Whites in it?
14:27
Yes.
14:28
So, basically were your friends some Black, some Whites?
14:34
Did your social life was more limited to the African Americans in the school?
14:41
In high school—the technical high school that I went to there were athletes and
14:48
there were others, like most schools.
14:51
Jocks stick together, and they would break separate, at that time, even
14:55
racially, even when they were on the field together, once they get
14:57
off the field it’s a different life.
15:00
I didn’t really hang that much with anybody, the truth be known.
15:03
The only reason I was a musician, I guess, because I didn’t
15:05
happen to belong to a gang.
15:08
I was too small to play athletics in high school.
15:12
I tried to go out for track, but I wasn’t fast enough.
15:15
As far as the only social part in high school, as I was concerned, was usually
15:21
sitting on a wall out front for school, then starts, and then went to class.
15:28
Most Black guys didn’t have that much to do with me in high school because I
15:30
wasn’t a jock, and because I was in the architectural department instead of out
15:35
in those shops and down working on a car.
15:37
I don’t know if I answered your question or not.
15:39
I think so.
15:41
I didn’t belong.
15:43
I’ve been outside my whole life.
15:46
I accept that.
15:54
High school was a waste of time.
15:56
They would take a whole year to teach you something you could learn in a day.
15:59
Okay, so now let’s proceed from high school and start going and
16:09
tell me, then, what did you do when you finished high school?
16:12
I came down here to go to school.
16:17
My folks, well, my dad in particular said you really ought to decide what you
16:21
want to do before you go off to college.
16:23
I said, well, I’m 17.
16:24
What can you tell me?
16:26
So, I came down here and played.
16:27
At that time, I think Eugene stopped about Chambers.
16:31
It was 1954.
16:33
I stayed in Unthank dorm the first year.
16:37
I took some basic training course.
16:39
I think I took an anthropology class, Ruth Benedict and Benedict’s Patterns
16:43
of Culture, or whatever it was.
16:45
It was all very foreign stuff to me.
16:47
I wasn’t a very good student.
16:49
I was bright, but I wasn’t very disciplined.
16:52
So, I made a mess of that, and came to the Fall of the second year and I
16:58
just finally got involved in, I just dropped out and went in the service.
17:02
Eugene, I was staying in Holekani [?] my sophomore year, with Hawaiian students.
17:08
Everybody thought I was Hawaiian anyway, what the hell?
17:11
I’ve been all sorts of things.
17:13
The university was a good design school.
17:19
At that time, they were still—there was a lot of lawn.
17:25
Where there’s structures now it was all lawn.
17:30
I don’t know if I can really talk about an academic career, because
17:32
I really wasn’t that—I was here.
17:36
What about your social life at school?
17:39
What kind of friends did you have?
17:41
Were there other African Americans, or who did you hang with?
17:46
Well, at the university the athletes, once again, the athletes that were
17:54
Black pretty much stick together.
17:56
First of all, they didn’t live on campus.
17:58
They weren’t Greeks.
18:03
Two of the guys from Portland, Black, we lived—one of them was a jock.
18:09
The other was going to be a musician, and I really didn’t socialize all that much.
18:14
I went over to the architectural school.
18:18
I forgot where it was.
18:19
It was across 11th somewhere.
18:23
I should have made—I’m not really prepared.
18:25
I should have done more research before we did this to help give you
18:29
rational kinds of answers to things.
18:32
But, no, I had an interest in design, but I really didn’t have an interest
18:36
in a whole lot of other things.
18:39
So, you had some friends, did you have some friends?
18:44
A few.
18:45
I knew a few.
18:47
Were they Black or White?
18:49
To what degree does the fact that you’re a very light-complected
18:53
African American influence the way that you had friends and so on?
19:00
Ah.
19:00
Well, that’s another... okay, I had probably two or three Black friends.
19:06
They came from Portland.
19:07
I already knew these guys.
19:09
Anybody down here was African.
19:10
They didn’t have anything to do with African Americans, Black Africans anyway,
19:14
because we’re all bastards, you know.
19:17
There was a couple of other guys I knew, a couple of fellas who lived in a co-op.
19:21
I knew them.
19:22
I knew them in class.
19:23
I didn’t run with them though.
19:26
Were they White?
19:27
Yeah.
19:28
They were White.
19:29
Did they just accept you as you?
19:32
I hope so.
19:34
[Chuckles] . We didn’t really discuss it.
19:37
For me—let me say this, for me, for race, I never bother to talk about it.
19:41
If it’s important to somebody else they usually bring it
19:43
up, and we take it from there.
19:46
But I’m an old man now, so.
19:48
This applies all the way back, even in the service.
19:54
Okay.
19:55
I’m not much of
20:00
an interviewee.
20:02
Well, tell us about, okay, so now you finished high school.
20:07
Yeah.
20:08
You went to the University of Oregon.
20:10
Right.
20:13
Didn’t work out so well.
20:14
No.
20:15
Then what happened?
20:17
A friend of mine said let’s go in the service.
20:20
I didn’t have a job.
20:22
I was in a mess, a social mess.
20:26
So, we went down to be inducted in the service, and I walked down various
20:32
branches of service had their own recruitment place and they would
20:35
all, you know... and I said, well, I’ll go in the Air Force because I
20:38
don’t have to crawl around in the dirt and that so I went Air Force.
20:43
I went to basic training in Oakland, because the Parks Air Force Base
20:48
was where the Air Force was training then because they closed Sampson
20:53
because Walter Winchell’s son had caught meningitis there and died.
20:58
They closed Sampson Air Force, which was in New York State.
21:01
Everybody was either here or Texas.
21:04
I decided maybe I wanted to be a pilot.
21:08
So, I took a bunch of exams for that.
21:10
After they told me I was going to be a radio operator and they were going
21:13
to send me to Biloxi, Mississippi.
21:15
I got red lined off of that.
21:17
Now, this is in the ‘50s.
21:19
Ultimately, I didn’t make it for one reason or another, so
21:23
I got what’s called a casual.
21:24
I was in basic training and they were saying to me you have to train somewhere.
21:29
You can’t be here for your entire enlistment.
21:31
So, I said to them, give me some cities.
21:35
They mentioned a bunch of different cities.
21:36
They said Washington, D.C.—actually Fort Belvoir, Virginia.
21:42
I said, send me there.
21:45
That’s where I went to mapping school.
21:48
They assigned me, I spent a summer in Washington, D.C.,
21:54
played in a club, as a matter of fact called maybe Bennie’s Rebel Room,
21:59
I think, was the name of the place.
22:01
There were a couple of clubs where GIs went to.
22:03
In Washington you could drink beer at 18.
22:07
if you got to have drunk then they’d send you whiskey after that.
22:09
But, you know, they’d close everything up.
22:13
I went to school there.
22:14
I finished my schooling there.
22:16
I came to Portland, cleaned up some messes I had made.
22:19
Then I went to Nebraska, and there it was no good.
22:23
Let’s go back to Washington.
22:25
What year were you in Washington?
22:27
Summer of ’56.
22:29
Summer of ’56.
22:30
Yes.
22:31
Washington was a very segregated city at that time.
22:32
Yes.
22:36
It was.
22:38
Tell us about that.
22:40
Most of the Black stuff at that time in the city was out South 7th.
22:43
Does that sound right?
22:45
Mm-hmm.
22:46
Okay.
22:46
There were some clubs out there somewhere which were on
22:48
level and some were down below.
22:53
I did see, now, I know were segregated, but I went to Olivia’s Patio Lounge.
22:59
It was a club.
23:01
Basically, it was a white club.
23:03
Maybe somebody said I was passing because I was in there.
23:05
I don’t know.
23:05
I just went.
23:07
I saw the Modern Jazz Quartet there.
23:09
I saw them stop playing when the people were talking.
23:13
That said, John Lewis said, we will listen to you talk if you’d
23:16
rather hear that than hear us play.
23:19
I’d never heard that sort of thing before.
23:22
I remember a friend of mine, who happened, at that time, to be White.
23:26
We took two interns who had come from the state of Oregon, my folks knew
23:33
the politicians in Portland, we took them to dinner out on Connecticut,
23:39
the Italian dinner out there.
23:40
it was just a date.
23:41
It was nothing serious, you know.
23:43
That was about the end of my social life in Washington, D.C.,
23:46
in terms of interacting with anybody who was not in the service.
23:53
You’re right.
23:53
They still, at that time, they still had cold water flats,
23:59
within walking distance of the White House.
24:03
I remember we ran to the top of the Washington Monument and there
24:06
was no drinking fountain up there.
24:10
I remember Washington.
24:11
There was no mall then.
24:17
Washington and Virginia, to go down to Virginia you’d change buses in
24:22
Alexandria behind a waffle shop.
24:25
If I get this right, the Black Cat was the name of the place.
24:28
These places you probably don’t know.
24:31
I don’t know Virginia.
24:32
I’ve been in Virginia, I have experiences there, but I don’t know about the
24:37
place specifically, but go ahead.
24:38
This is so long ago, come on.
24:40
How do I remember these things?
24:42
As I said, it was basically an engineering school, Army engineering.
24:47
It’s an Army base, and I was—but Air Force we still went to their schools.
24:53
Washington, D.C., though, was, as you said, segregated.
24:59
My mother was back there visiting relatives one time, and would send stuff
25:03
to Portland and they’d ask him, do you have to take a ship to get to Oregon?
25:09
She said, no.
25:10
We took a train.
25:13
So, I don’t know.
25:14
We went to the Smithsonian when it was only one structure, the castle.
25:19
It
25:23
was the first time I’d ever been on the East coast.
25:27
I had to be, I guess, made aware of the fact that because of segregation
25:32
things you had to know where you were going if you had business there.
25:37
There were no race riots there, that I recall, at that time.
25:41
I saw some in Nebraska, though, on the base.
25:44
They don’t make the paper.
25:48
Washington was,
25:51
I went there in the summertime, so I wasn’t used to that kind of humidity.
25:55
You live there, you know.
25:56
The temperature’s 95 and so
26:01
is the humidity.
26:01
How would you compare, then, and I will talk about, will ask you to
26:08
talk about the racial situation.
26:10
Sure.
26:11
Compare that racial situation in Washington, so that was 1956.
26:16
Right.
26:19
Compare that to Portland.
26:24
In ’56?
26:29
It was about the same.
26:30
Oregon was about the same.
26:32
People think it’s the great out west, but no.
26:34
Oregon was different.
26:35
It still is.
26:38
Segregated housing, both places.
26:41
The homes, there were probably more people in Portland, unless they
26:44
worked for the federal government in the east who had their own homes.
26:49
As far as entertainment’s concerned, in Washington, D.C., basically you
26:54
had White clubs and Black clubs.
26:55
In Portland, you had White clubs and Black clubs, but the Black
27:00
clubs had a lot of white clientele.
27:05
There was a place in Portland called the Dude Ranch, and the mayor, a woman
27:11
at that time, Dorothy McCullough Lee, in the late ‘40s closed the place
27:15
because there was too much interracial
27:19
activities going on in the club.
27:25
Portland is still unique.
27:27
I can’t talk about now, because everybody there is from somewhere else.
27:34
But at that time, because the neighborhoods were set up in
27:37
Portland Black people were basically here and that was it.
27:43
My grandfather had bought a house from a white realtor.
27:46
That’s why we lived where we lived.
27:48
We didn’t live at [unclear] . There wasn’t really that—to this day I
27:52
don’t think there are 25,000 people in the city of Portland, Black.
27:57
The neighborhood is pretty much gone, not where I lived, but
28:00
where most Black people were.
28:02
Where the coliseum was, now it’s—I don’t know where they call that,
28:07
where the basketball player is.
28:08
What is it?
28:11
Bark—I forgot the name of the sports center.
28:17
They didn’t have a basketball team in ’56.
28:20
Everybody on the east coast thought we still had dog sleds out here and canoes.
28:27
Portland, Washington, D.C.,--how do I compare that?
28:32
Well, as I said, basically the weather’s different.
28:35
The attitude’s pretty much the same.
28:38
In Portland people could roller skate on a couple nights and a couple places.
28:42
The rest of the week they couldn’t roller skate there.
28:45
You could swim in the parks.
28:46
The parks were integrated.
28:49
The park pools were integrated.
28:52
The schools were integrated.
28:54
The social part—that’s completely different.
29:00
We are now—you’ve been in Washington.
29:05
Right.
29:06
You’ve gotten some education.
29:09
Yes.
29:11
In the Army, was it?
29:13
Air Force.
29:14
In the Air Force.
29:15
Yes.
29:16
Now what?
29:18
The kind of work I did they sent me to Omaha, Nebraska, headquarters
29:21
of Strategic Air Command.
29:21
My work there as a map maker, a Photogrammer, I was in the 544.
29:21
We’re going to say that’s military intelligence.
29:21
Part of the strategic air command.
29:22
At
29:41
that time it was Colonial LeMay—I’m sorry, General LeMay.
29:47
General LeMay was a very famous warrior and he put the SAC Headquarters in the
29:52
middle, because that was the center of the continental United States.
29:57
At that time Russia was an enemy.
30:00
Russia was the biggest enemy.
30:04
General LeMay was keeping the world in order, his own rules.
30:10
Had I talked to anybody—I played music in downtown Omaha.
30:14
I saw people come in in brown suits and nobody dresses like that.
30:18
They were seeing what I was doing.
30:21
They would probably write reports on me, too.
30:23
I did not hang out with the musicians downtown.
30:26
I just went to town to play music, and I went back to base.
30:33
At that time, that was the Cold War.
30:35
Most people are too young to remember that part of history.
30:39
It was a serious time.
30:42
I worked for the people who could destroy the earth in 47 minutes.
30:49
Most of the things I, the work I did, I couldn’t talk about.
30:53
My family knew I made maps in Nebraska, but they didn’t know what they were
30:58
maps of or anything else about it.
31:02
If anybody asked me that was outside of my family, I’d tell them I worked in supply.
31:07
It was easier.
31:09
Omaha, Nebraska, was segregated at that time.
31:15
There was all other kinds of segregation, too, within the ranks.
31:20
Generally, just Airmen didn’t really associate with those people who
31:24
were non-commissioned officers, and they didn’t associate socially
31:29
with people who were officers.
31:33
These officers didn’t associate with these officers, because these were
31:36
the hierarchy, you know, even though everybody listened to who’s above.
31:39
I
31:41
spent 38 months in a hole, in 544, in my time in the service.
31:48
They sent me to some other schools, too, in St. Louis, for mapping.
31:51
The social thing, well, it’s the same.
31:54
The same thing about segregation—it existed.
32:00
Did it exist for me?
32:02
Yeah.
32:03
A lot.
32:05
How did you deal with that?
32:07
I accepted it.
32:10
If you didn’t accept it you got more problems.
32:12
You couldn’t get anything done.
32:17
Clubs, social clubs that people came to town to, the base, to have social
32:21
things to have social things and there would be White women and Black women
32:25
and there were Black sailors and Black Airmen and White Airmen and sometimes
32:29
there were problems inside the building.
32:31
Sometimes there were problems outside the building.
32:33
Generally, it was racial, more or less inflamed by alcohol.
32:40
So, describe that
32:44
a little bit more.
32:45
It’d have to be edited.
32:46
Describe it
32:48
how?
32:49
What was causing problems?
32:53
Yeah.
32:55
Okay, the alcohol, the racial, the women, the Black women, the
33:01
White women—I imagine all of that is involved in there in some way.
33:06
Give us an idea.
33:08
Give us that picture.
33:09
Okay, that picture.
33:11
If the women are coming from Omaha, if they are local to Omaha, then they
33:15
already know about segregated societies.
33:18
If they’re coming to the base somehow, that had, in some instances,
33:22
its own kind of morality, even though they had segregated housing
33:29
for married base personnel.
33:34
It would start out friendly enough.
33:37
They’re all serving beer in the service club there.
33:42
Well, things, I can’t give you—I could talk about specific incidents,
33:48
but I can’t give a universal answer to that kind of question.
33:52
Give us a couple of examples of specific incidents.
33:54
Oh, maybe somebody stepped on somebody’s shoes while they were dancing and
33:58
that’s an excuse to start a problem.
34:01
Young people do things like that.
34:03
Used to.
34:04
I have no idea what they do now.
34:07
You would end up with a knot on your head or something, and
34:09
that’s about as far as it went.
34:11
Now, you might be dead.
34:12
I don’t know.
34:13
I cannot compare my time to now.
34:18
I can’t compare my time—I’m not making excuses for this, but I’m
34:21
just saying it’s just different.
34:22
The rules are different.
34:24
Maybe the attitudes are the same, but the limitations are different.
34:29
Tell us more about your time.
34:31
My time.
34:33
Maybe my time was exceptional.
34:37
Because I did pretty much what I wanted.
34:39
I don’t say that arrogantly, but I just did.
34:42
Did I have the same rules apply to me?
34:44
Probably.
34:45
Did I ignore them?
34:46
Often.
34:47
I
34:49
didn’t go out of my way to do anything different than I had been doing before,
34:53
and somebody’d have to tap me on the shoulder and say well, you can’t do that.
34:55
I’d go, oh, okay.
34:57
I can’t do that.
34:59
Give some specific examples of these things.
35:01
Some specific examples.
35:04
Alright, here’s a specific example.
35:07
Six of us decided to rent a house down in the woods two miles from the base.
35:15
How do I do this?
35:20
So, we used to have parties down there.
35:25
Now we’re GIs, alcohol.
35:27
Sometimes the girls are from the base, sometimes they’re from town.
35:34
Some of the guys who were in the house with us were from the south and they were
35:39
white, but we’re all in the same group.
35:42
We did the same kind of work together.
35:44
Now, had they been doing other kinds of work there might have
35:46
been a lot of problems, but we all agreed on, it was unwritten.
35:49
This is where we are.
35:50
This is what we’re doing.
35:51
We’re not supposed to be here, because we’re not married but we
35:54
all agree on what our own rules are.
35:57
Racially, that would have been a problem for the city of Omaha.
36:01
But it wasn’t a problem for us because we had our own rules because
36:05
we weren’t on property that belonged to the government or the city.
36:09
We weren’t doing anything that was illegal, but it
36:11
might have been frowned on.
36:13
How did I do?
36:15
That’s as far as I’m going to go with that, because the rest you can guess.
36:22
Maybe I’m not the right guy to be interviewed here.
36:24
I don’t know.
36:27
So you were there for a while.
36:29
Then what?
36:30
I would come home at week-ons.
36:32
I was there for—I came home at Christmas-time.
36:35
I met Martha in December of 1956.
36:42
In?
36:42
In Portland.
36:43
I went home for Portland.
36:47
Then, I don’t know, we just started corresponding and
36:52
that’s kind of how that went.
36:53
I’d come home on leave and I’d see Martha.
36:57
We’d go to the beach or whatever.
36:59
But, I never—there were a lot of problems with that.
37:05
Her parents had a problem it.
37:07
My parents had a problem with it.
37:10
Tell us more about that.
37:12
Did you ever see the movie Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?
37:15
I lived it way before it made a movie.
37:19
Her parents weren’t accepting of me and my parents—my mother did.
37:22
My dad wouldn’t accept her.
37:25
Ultimately, her parents accepted me after Martha started to
37:30
have Shannon, who you just saw.
37:33
Shannon was a very cute little baby.
37:36
Suddenly, they were grandparents and they wanted to see what
37:39
our grandkids looked like.
37:43
Apparently, they came out okay.
37:49
I don’t think nobody wants to hear all this.
37:52
This is how the real stuff went.
37:54
Well, that’s what we want to know.
37:55
Okay.
37:56
The real stuff.
37:57
The real stuff.
37:58
The real stuff.
38:01
I never took my kids to Black church, but I didn’t take
38:03
them to White church, either.
38:05
I figured when they grow up they can decide how they want to
38:07
do that, which they have done.
38:09
My younger girl is very involved in her church in Portland.
38:12
My older girl, who you met, she doesn’t bother with any of that stuff.
38:19
My kids are, my kids know they’re Black.
38:22
My grandkids know they’re Black.
38:25
It says so on their certificate, I guess.
38:27
I don’t know.
38:27
Mine says negro, doesn’t it?
38:29
You saw.
38:33
We have lived basically outside of all of that stuff.
38:38
We have friends that are Black or White or otherwise.
38:44
People accept us or they don’t.
38:47
There’s no club, as far as I know.
38:50
As far as Portland, we have friends who, Martha primarily had friends who she
38:57
couldn’t talk to anymore because of me.
38:58
She lost jobs because of me.
39:06
We stayed in Portland until we moved to California in ’65.
39:09
Okay, about our marriage.
39:11
We’re probably the oldest Black-White marriage in the state of Oregon.
39:17
We first were going to get married, Martha had a friend whose
39:21
husband was an Episcopal priest.
39:25
They were going to counsel us on getting married, but it was,
39:32
I forgot what do you call a person who’s a—was he a bishop?
39:37
Whatever, not the minister himself.
39:39
Not the priest himself, but somebody was going to counsel
39:41
us in marriage counseling.
39:42
He says, I don’t think I can do this in the state of Oregon.
39:44
I said, well, miscegenation, now that’s 1951.
39:47
This is 1960.
39:48
You can do this.
39:49
So, there you are.
39:51
We got married, we went to the County Courthouse to get the
39:57
license and we went through that.
39:59
We got married at a church at a church that was Episcopal Church, and we had
40:02
our reception at my folk’s AME church, which they had moved because they
40:08
built the coliseum and tore it down and they went to the other church.
40:11
That was kind of a compromise, or an agreement.
40:15
I
40:18
guess in fact we had two services, huh?
40:23
How am I doing with all
40:26
this?
40:26
I don’t know.
40:26
Where is this going?
40:28
We’re just, it’s going.
40:29
Okay.
40:31
So, you had the two services.
40:34
At the reception at the—
40:37
Black church.
40:38
At the Black church.
40:39
Yeah.
40:39
So, were all the guests that came there from your side of the
40:43
family and your friends, or, not your friends or your parents’?
40:46
Were they basically then, that was the Black one and then—?
40:51
Yeah, the congregation of the Black church was there.
40:56
The minister was upset because he didn’t do our ceremonies, because
41:01
we had that done on the west side.
41:05
I didn’t go to church anyway.
41:06
It didn’t matter.
41:07
As
41:12
a, concession wouldn’t be the word... for the sake of my folks
41:16
we had the reception there.
41:20
Then for Martha’s folks?
41:22
They weren’t there.
41:24
Did you have another type of reception or gathering for them and their friends?
41:30
No.
41:30
That didn’t happen.
41:31
Martha had a friend stand up for her at the wedding.
41:35
I didn’t know her parents until Martha was about to have a baby, and a
41:38
medical doctor who was a doctor of my father-in-law’s decided, he said, you
41:42
really need to straighten this out, because my father-in-law is from Missouri.
41:48
He came to Oregon way back when.
41:49
It
41:52
ended up being, it all ended up fine.
41:57
I got along better with him than I got along with my own father.
42:02
We did the whole thing.
42:04
We are history.
42:11
So, now we’re probably getting to the part where you start having
42:15
more work and I know you have a very complex, interesting work history.
42:23
[Chuckles]
42:25
. Tell us more about that, and maybe as you tell it where racial issues come into it.
42:33
Tell us where they really had nothing to do with anything.
42:37
Let us know that, too.
42:39
Okay.
42:41
I decided I wanted to go to the Art Center in Los Angeles.
42:46
That’s before they moved to Newhall or wherever they went.
42:49
So, we had, I was working in a hotel.
42:55
I was going to Portland State some.
42:57
I was working
43:00
in a restaurant.
43:02
Sometimes room service.
43:04
Sometimes serving wine downstairs, sometime bussing, whatever.
43:08
I wasn’t a bartender, sometimes waiter.
43:15
I needed to make enough money to go to school out of state.
43:20
So, I was out of the service.
43:23
I went to the Urban League, and they issued me had I been a
43:30
graduate from college they could get me a job as a school teacher.
43:35
Well, one, I didn’t graduate from college.
43:37
Second, I had absolutely no interest in education.
43:44
I interviewed for a job, well, I got some jobs, I remember.
43:49
Martha was working, before kids Martha was working at
43:52
an employment agency and they got me a job working in a machine shop.
43:59
But ultimately, this is out of sync here, but it doesn’t matter.
44:04
I ended up going to Carnation Milk Company, they had advertised a
44:08
job for a driver for a firetruck they wanted to do for a promotion.
44:13
I went to interview for that job, and I
44:19
think.
44:22
I called them and I told them I didn’t want the job.
44:24
They said, why don’t you want the job?
44:25
I said, because kids are going to be climbing on this fire truck.
44:28
If they fall off, I’m going to feel responsible for it, so what
44:31
other kinds of jobs you got?
44:32
They said, well, we have route sales.
44:34
I said, what’s that?
44:35
They said that’s a milkman.
44:36
I said, well, let me apply for one of those jobs.
44:40
I went down there and I told Urban League I’m going to apply for a job as a milkman.
44:45
They said don’t set your sights too high.
44:48
I went to Carnation Company and they hired me.
44:53
I got a route.
44:54
I didn’t get a route in a black neighborhood.
44:55
I got a route in southeast Portland.
45:00
Other milk companies were trying to get my customers because they
45:03
said why do you want a Black man bringing you milk to your house for?
45:06
My argument was, if you had a Black waiter in a restaurant, would you care?
45:11
And I’m not selling black milk.
45:13
I
45:16
had the inside serves, which means I had the keys to the people’s house.
45:20
Early serves go and put it in the refrigerator.
45:27
In those days, the milkman was kind of an extension of some families.
45:32
I had no problem with customers.
45:34
I lost customers because I was Black, but customers come and
45:37
go in that business anyway.
45:40
I had customers who—matter of fact, one of my customers taught
45:43
me geometry in high school.
45:48
We would chat.
45:51
So, racially, I didn’t have any problems with the company.
45:56
I didn’t have any problems with basically my business part with my customers.
46:03
It was okay.
46:03
When we got ready to go to California, they gave me all kinds of stuff.
46:07
Christmastime, they gave me stuff for my kids.
46:10
My youngest one was like this, I said Shannon was about like this.
46:15
I didn’t have any problems racially there.
46:18
Then after, of course, I was there the Urban League was sending all kinds of
46:21
guys out there for jobs, but that’s okay.
46:26
So I didn’t—I don’t know.
46:28
Then we went to California and I don’t you I got there they were
46:30
having lots of riots August 19, 1965.
46:34
I’m trying to find a place to live with my family.
46:37
In California, I went to work for Carnation Company,
46:42
because I’d worked here.
46:43
It was easy.
46:44
I wanted to go to school but I still needed to make money.
46:48
I worked at the Black plant in Los Angeles.
46:51
If you’re familiar with LA, it was off La Brea, right where
47:01
Hughes Machinery, well that doesn’t matter.
47:03
We were north of LAX in Los Angeles.
47:09
The Black branch had all of south central LA all up into Beverly Hills.
47:16
I
47:19
had a route that was half upper middle class Japanese and some
47:25
middle and lower middle class Blacks.
47:31
Being a milkman,
47:34
I don’t know how to explain it about LA.
47:36
As a milkman in LA, the racial thing was not an issue because when I first
47:43
went there I didn’t have a route.
47:45
I was a called a stubman, which means I built routes.
47:48
Then I would put in the new stops, feed them into existing
47:52
driver’s route, re-route him.
47:56
That’s typology, right.
47:58
The science of routing.
48:03
I had people slam doors in my face because they were afraid I was going to rob them.
48:06
I’m wearing a white uniform with Carnation over my chest, on my chest, driving
48:13
a white truck with red letters on it.
48:17
I’d knock on somebody’s door and they’re going like this
48:19
[bobs head] . They’re afraid.
48:20
Okay, they can be afraid.
48:21
It had nothing to do with me.
48:22
I’m just the milkman.
48:24
I didn’t wear a hat and a bowtie, but I had a white uniform.
48:30
I learned Los Angeles from that perspective.
48:32
I learned Los Angeles from, oh, once again, it was—the city was in
48:39
transition, not because of racially.
48:42
People were going to the valley.
48:44
People had been moving into what had been Jewish neighborhoods on the
48:49
west side because at that time there was a time in which you could not
48:54
go western if you were Black, unless you were domestic up in those houses.
48:59
So,
49:02
the racial part of it in LA, Martha can talk to some of that if you’re
49:06
going to talk to her about it.
49:07
I just went to work.
49:10
Then I went back into mapping business after I got out of milk.
49:14
Did I ever go to school?
49:16
I took some course at UCLA.
49:17
I never went to Art Center.
49:22
Where do I go from here?
49:23
What do you want?
49:25
Well, let’s, after what you have become, the process to,
49:33
just continue on with the rest.
49:34
In terms of—
49:35
Okay, I went back... okay, from LA I went back out of the milk
49:39
business I went back to mapping.
49:44
I hired, because I had been educated in that business as a cartographer
49:50
and photogrammetrist, I was hired at Rural Service Corporation, which
49:54
had been Fairchild Arial Surveys.
49:59
One of the jobs that they were working when I got there was Afghanistan.
50:03
That in the mid ‘60s.
50:05
Is this still in LA?
50:06
In LA.
50:09
That company I worked for had taken over what had been Pathé,
50:14
the company that made news reels.
50:16
The studio’s up on Santa Monica Boulevard between Mccadden and, I
50:23
forgot the name of the other street.
50:26
They still had the logo over the door, but we were in a warehouse.
50:31
It was International Mapping Company.
50:35
I said we were mapping Afghanistan at the time.
50:38
There were a couple of domestic jobs they were doing, too,
50:44
on the Ohio River.
50:46
The Afghanistan job,
50:51
racially you wanted me to talk about the company.
50:54
There could have been 14 languages spoken there, because we have map makers there
50:59
from all over the world, some of which had been athletes that had come to the
51:02
United States, even though they did.
51:05
They’d gone down to Patagonia and mapped that.
51:08
They’d gone, the survey crews, and a lot of South Americans and Central Americans.
51:22
When did you come to Portland?
51:23
We moved back in 1971.
51:27
Then what, tell us where you lived then.
51:31
Where did you live then in Portland?
51:34
What kind of neighborhood?
51:35
We moved back to Portland in the southwest.
51:39
Some people would say, it all depends on how old you are.
51:43
They would have said, Corbett Terwilliger.
51:46
Then they’d call it Johns Landing.
51:48
Now I think they call it South Portland.
51:51
We were in the house 42 years.
51:55
My kids went to the neighborhood grade school.
51:57
They didn’t get bussed.
51:59
It was two blocks from the house.
52:02
No.
52:03
That’s not right.
52:03
We lived in the neighborhood, but we didn’t have the house.
52:05
Ultimately, we had a rental,
52:09
a few blocks away.
52:12
I put in 42 job applications in Portland for the kind of work I was trained to do.
52:19
Which was?
52:21
Map maker.
52:23
A friend of mine got me a job as a technical illustrator for
52:26
a new company that had been spun out of a larger company.
52:30
They built electron microscopes.
52:34
I
52:37
was an artist, but I was not a technical illustrator, so I got the job and I had
52:43
a book in the drawer on how to illustrate that way and I started doing it for
52:47
these exploded views of this device.
52:52
I was there a couple of years until they went out of business,
52:55
and my friend got me a job at Tektronix, an electronic draftsman.
53:01
Ultimately, I was there to do their exhibits for them.
53:05
I’d also be an exhibit designer for Tektronix.
53:09
My family was still going to a neighborhood school.
53:11
The neighborhood school was integrated.
53:14
There were people who were professionals, a lot of people in the neighborhood
53:19
worked blue collar jobs, whatever on earth that means, manufacturing.
53:25
There were people in the neighborhood who had been there for a couple generations.
53:33
The neighborhood now is completely different.
53:35
It’s all gone.
53:36
Kids, the children, are bussed out of that school now because it’s now a language
53:42
school, I think, a private school.
53:47
There were racial problems,
53:51
not that I know about them.
53:52
There weren’t that many Black kids in the school, and those few kids that were
53:55
there wasn’t a problem, that I know.
53:59
There were more class issues there than there was racial issues.
54:04
When the kids from the neighborhoods where my children grew up were
54:08
going to junior high school and high school they had to go up.
54:12
They called the kids down where we lived carp town, because it’s near the river.
54:18
At that time before my kids were in school, back in my time they had
54:23
mills along the river: lumber mills, French companies, things of that sort.
54:27
They’d bring the logs right in and work them right there.
54:31
That’s Portland in the early ‘70s.
54:34
We’re back in, I said, then my parents became more active grandparents, as
54:40
had Martha’s parents became grand [parents] . There was never really a
54:44
competition between the grandparents, but there was a very different social
54:49
difference between the grandparents.
54:52
Do you think that social difference had more to do with
54:59
their own backgrounds or race?
55:03
Or can that even be separated out?
55:08
I think it’s inclusive.
55:09
I don’t think you can separate them out.
55:14
My in-laws, and my mother grew fine.
55:17
My father never got there.
55:20
They were very accepting of my children and me.
55:29
My mother loved my wife more than she loved me, which is easy to do
55:36
[smiles] . Yeah, I think, like I said basically we were outsiders.
55:41
For your children growing up in those schools,
55:48
did they have friends that were, were all their friends
55:52
Black or did they have friends
55:56
that were White?
55:57
My daughters tried to date Black men.
56:00
It didn’t work . The expectations were different—what they
56:03
wanted to do was different.
56:05
Both my daughters married White men.
56:06
A long time.
56:08
Shannon’s been married, what, 33 years?
56:10
Amy’s been married 28 years.
56:12
Same guys.
56:13
What was different that made it not turn out?
56:18
In terms of the expectations that the Black guys had?
56:24
This becomes my opinion and their opinion.
56:29
Yeah.
56:31
Face was a different issue—how you present yourself.
56:37
Status was a different, was completely different.
56:44
I can only conject on what young guys were thinking at that time.
56:50
It
56:53
wasn’t anything intellectual.
56:56
It was
57:01
a disaster.
57:04
Explain that.
57:10
Explain it.
57:14
Amy, the younger girl, cooked a dinner as I recall.
57:19
I may not get this right.
57:20
She did a very fine meal, and the guest who came had no
57:25
idea what they were eating.
57:31
I think the problems that matter is sophistication.
57:35
Anybody can learn anything if they care.
57:40
I don’t think they cared.
57:41
I don’t think they wanted to learn anything different
57:42
than what they were doing.
57:44
Comfort zone.
57:45
Is that what I want to say?
57:46
They were out of their comfort zone.
57:49
I don’t think we made them feel any different in our own home.
57:55
Matter of fact, we had some fireman come to the house one time that had
57:58
gone to high school with my daughter.
58:00
They’re so busy looking at the art we had in the house they would take care of me.
58:07
Yeah, I think it’s a matter of sophistication.
58:09
That’s all.
58:12
It didn’t work.
58:15
Okay.
