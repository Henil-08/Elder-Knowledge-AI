00:00
There’s a neutral area in front of Hammond School, and, I’m so proud of this because
00:13
they announce my birthday and the kids, some of them having fun counting.
00:18
Oh!
00:18
We did the math today!
00:19
And I said, you did what?
00:19
“We found out how
00:24
old you
00:33
are!” And, I said, shame on you.
00:37
But,
00:41
they do that.
00:41
Sometimes the newspaper comes out and takes pictures of the birthday party.
00:45
Now, that’s it.
00:45
You’re into my life.
00:45
You know all about me.
00:46
Ed—this is the love of my life [holds up 8”x11” photo] . It’s
00:46
my husband, Wilber Hammond.
00:46
Wilber was in the Army.
00:46
Military’s really in our lives.
00:46
Dwayne was in the Navy.
00:46
Dwayne’s first
01:00
son was in the Navy.
01:00
Dwayne’s wife was in the Navy.
01:02
I was not in the Navy.
01:03
You became an educator—a valuable educator.
01:03
No.
01:03
I just handle pictures.
01:03
Okay, you had some
01:10
questions.
01:10
You can ask me.
01:37
Okay,
01:45
well, I understand from what you’ve told me before
01:51
that you’re basically, you grew up in New Orleans.
01:53
Is that right?
01:54
Yes.
01:55
So, when—
01:55
I didn’t just grow up.
01:58
I was born in New Orleans.
02:00
So, when did you come to Oregon?
02:04
A
02:06
good question.
02:08
I came to Oregon many, many years ago.
02:14
I came to Oregon first to go attend school at Portland, University of Portland.
02:23
I came to get a graduate degree at
02:34
University of Portland.
02:35
That was, oh, I’d say about 1950s.
02:45
A long time ago.
02:47
So, what made you choose the University of Oregon?
02:52
The University of Portland.
02:54
And University of Portland.
02:56
What made you think of coming all the way to Oregon from Louisiana?
03:02
At Loyola we were looking at schools that had the best psychology program.
03:10
I was interested in psychology at the time.
03:18
University of Portland had the best program.
03:23
So, I had an aunt, an uncle, Velma and Ed, who had moved here during World War II.
03:33
So, I thought, hey.
03:35
I could live with them and attend school here.
03:40
So, that’s why I came here to attend school first at
03:47
the University of Portland.
03:47
How was that?
03:48
Was there—did it turn out as well as you wanted it to?
03:54
It was wonderful.
03:56
I had a chance to intern at Fairview
04:02
and it was great.
04:04
But, I, Geraldine, was not excited about being with
04:12
that level of people, because there were so many folks that had such great needs.
04:23
I thought all day with
04:29
people with disabilities was really not my cup of tea.
04:32
So,
04:34
I thought, no.
04:37
I think I’d rather have classes for school administrators or some
04:48
organization where there was the possibility of improving.
04:54
I thought, oh some of these folks were in their 50s and 60s
05:01
and probably would not improve.
05:04
In schools, based on your skills, you can certainly see improvement in
05:15
children.
05:17
So, when you came here to Oregon.
05:20
So, you’d already been at university in New Orleans, and then you came here for
05:25
higher university education... how would you compare your experiences living in New
05:35
Orleans to coming and living in Portland?
05:41
I had to compare it in many ways.
05:45
Alright, if you look at schools it’s quite different.
05:49
In New Orleans, when I first went to
05:57
LSU—Louisiana State University—it was very difficult because
06:04
the group of us that was chosen, the schools, for that school had been not
06:14
graduate students but they chose only the students who were going to graduate with
06:24
honors.
06:24
So, the whole list of us was sent—that was terrible, because
06:32
we sat in a roped-off area and we attended class in that same area.
06:42
We were not allowed to go into the main population.
06:49
But, at Dillard, where I did my undergrad work, Dillard
06:55
University in New Orleans was
07:04
all African Americans.
07:04
It was a private Methodist school and it was wonderful.
07:11
I thought the classes were great, as great as they could be.
07:17
Yes, that’s where I got my undergrad work.
07:22
Then, you came to University of Portland.
07:26
University of Portland.
07:27
What about the race relations there?
07:29
What was that like?
07:31
It was different, because I think I was the only person who
07:41
was of African American descent at University of Portland.
07:49
And—are you waiting to tell me something, are you, mister photographer?
07:53
We’re just going to take a quick pause.
07:57
I want to make one correction
08:02
on
08:05
my microphone, please.
08:06
We’re getting great audio on you, but—
08:06
How can you?
08:06
I have a quake—y voice.
08:08
We got you covered.
08:09
Really?
08:09
Yeah.
08:09
Electronics are really good now.
08:14
Well, you know of course it’s off now.
08:17
Hmm?
08:17
Are you recording?
08:17
Oh
08:22
yeah, I just made one slight adjustment.
08:24
Okay, so let’s continue.
08:26
We’re good.
08:27
We’ll fix it in the mix.
08:29
You’ll fix it?
08:30
Okay, because I have to share, I had a
08:38
stroke in ’94.
08:41
My voice was really traumatized, I guess.
08:48
So,
08:51
I still have a lot of speaking engagements, and my voice,
08:56
I thought, sounds terrible.
08:59
So, they used botox.
09:05
I get a botox in my vocal cords, and my voice is clear as a bell.
09:12
Nice.
09:13
But, expecting you today, I did not because it hurts!
09:19
Hurts!
09:19
Hurts!
09:20
It’s not that I didn’t want to sound clear and beautiful, but I didn’t want to hurt.
09:30
This is fine, because this is you.
09:31
This is natural you, and that’s what’s important.
09:33
And, it’s engaging, too.
09:36
It’s very engaging.
09:37
Yes.
09:39
Okay.
09:39
So, we were talking about your experience at the University of Portland.
09:39
Ok.
09:39
I hope you didn’t see that.
09:40
Okay, m experience
09:50
at University of Portland was
09:59
different from UCLA.
10:01
It was different from Gilbert Academy.
10:01
It was different from Dillard, in that the ratio of African Americans
10:06
to Whites, Caucasians, was always
10:13
different.
10:14
Dillard was an all African American school.
10:20
UCLA, Loyola, was an all-White, all-Caucasian school.
10:29
With
10:31
University of Portland, there was mixture, like
10:38
an eighth of “others,” and maybe 1 or
10:51
2 African Americans.
10:54
What I discovered in my 85 years is that if there is a small number of
11:04
African Americans or “others,” it’s not
11:12
as threatening. You’re treated as someone special.
11:15
Oh, there goes Geraldine.
11:18
Make sure if you do a picture, she’s included.
11:23
But,
11:27
the relationship it’s wonderful in some places and it’s on a day-to-day basis
11:42
at others.
11:43
Sometimes many people anticipate something negative might happen, and
11:48
others are delighted to meet you.
11:53
Can you give some examples?
11:55
Okay, for example, there are persons who want to have the “Black experience,”
12:05
so they want to have lunch with you.
12:08
They want to have dinner with you.
12:09
They want to sit next to you in class.
12:17
To me, that’s different.
12:19
Whereas, with an all one race group, one ethnicity, you just are a part of the mix.
12:30
For the ones that want to have the “Black experience,”
12:36
what do you think about that?
12:38
What do I think about that?
12:39
Yeah, is that a positive?
12:41
Negative?
12:43
I really can’t tell you, because it’s up to the individual whether they
12:52
want to be inclusive, collective, or
12:57
isolated.
12:59
For me?
13:01
It’s fine.
13:02
I’ve been each one.
13:04
I have met wonderful people
13:11
who wanted to have the “Black experience,” who want to touch my hair, feel my skin,
13:16
and I have relatives that say, no, no.
13:22
I say, yes, yes.
13:24
Why not?
13:26
They want to know what it’s like.
13:29
I’ve had many experiences with that.
13:32
I had one lady who said, oh, you have such beautiful skin!
13:38
I said, thank you!
13:40
She said, well, you know African Americans don’t have pores.
13:47
I said, oh, thank you for telling me that!
13:50
I did not know that.
13:54
Then, a couple of days later, you know how we get those blemishes
14:02
at certain times of the month?
14:05
I couldn’t wait to tell her, you know?
14:10
I now have a blemish!
14:16
It went right over her head.
14:19
I said, it’s because of integration, you know?
14:25
[Laughs] I said, somehow I have a blemish.
14:29
I have a pimple in my perfect skin, and it’s clogged.
14:37
What does that say for integration?
14:42
I felt terrible.
14:44
She didn’t—I could have saved my breath for a dying day because
14:49
she didn’t even get the joke.
14:53
She didn’t get the hint.
14:56
It just, she just didn’t get it, that it was biologically impossible
15:03
for me to be existing without pores.
15:09
What other examples do
15:13
you have?
15:13
Of?
15:14
Some of the negative things.
15:15
Then we’ll have examples of the positive things.
15:17
I’d appreciate that.
15:19
I’m really a positive person.
15:21
I try to be.
15:27
At one school, I had a lady who thought
15:34
we should name the mascot “coon.” I never quite got that, because coons had
15:45
the white hand or something. But since they had a Black principal, then our
15:50
mascot should be.... anyway, I didn’t
15:58
have to deal with that.
15:59
Staff took care of her.
16:01
They just—oh, you are
16:04
joking!
16:05
I’m embarrassed that you said that!
16:09
I just walked out of the room.
16:14
I just didn’t, I didn’t feel her and at that time I didn’t want to.
16:23
Yeah.
16:25
What were some of the positive?
16:28
Positive?
16:28
I have positives every day, because I wake up expecting them.
16:37
I could not start to tell you what the positives were, are, and will
16:45
be, because it depends on the person.
16:51
I meet great persons.
16:54
I meet not so great persons.
16:59
Life has been just wonderful for me.
17:05
When you first came—you went and you were living with your,
17:09
you had an aunt and uncle here.
17:11
Yes.
17:12
Tell us where did they live in Portland?
17:18
They lived in Portland.
17:21
They lived in northeast Portland.
17:23
My uncle was in the service, in the military and my aunt
17:31
worked for the VA hospital.
17:37
What neighborhood, what street, where did they live?
17:42
Do you remember?
17:44
I think—that was a long time ago, 1948, ’49?
17:50
My aunt and uncle lived in northeast Portland.
17:57
What kind of a house was it, or apartment?
18:00
House.
18:01
Uh-huh.
18:02
Then, so you lived with them until when?
18:07
I did.
18:09
Okay, now, I would have to start with a chronology and start
18:10
saying—I came here [laughs]
18:10
. Good.
18:10
That’s what I want.
18:10
I can’t do
18:12
that, because
18:23
I’m getting old and forgetful.
18:24
But,
18:29
I know I came here in, that’s a good question—1953, I think.
18:44
You came here.
18:45
You moved in with your aunt and uncle, and you were going to school.
18:51
How long did you stay with them?
18:54
Oh my God, for several years.
18:58
I enjoyed it, because I came from a family of 7,
19:06
and moved to a family of my aunt and uncle, who had no children [laughs]
19:15
. I enjoyed it.
19:17
It was fantastic.
19:20
I had aunt and uncle to myself.
19:25
I had access to the car.
19:29
You go from being one of seven children, to the only child.
19:37
That was wonderful.
19:39
In the neighborhood where they lived, were there a lot of
19:42
African Americans at the time?
19:44
There were.
19:44
About 7th, where we lived, was mixed.
19:56
I spent so much time in school.
20:00
I guess, when I think about it, the neighborhood was okay.
20:09
It was a mixed neighborhood,
20:17
and, let’s see—most of
20:23
the folks were pleasant.
20:23
I was young.
20:24
Aunt Velma and Uncle Phil were a light in the neighborhood.
20:32
We attended
20:36
Mt. Olivet Church.
20:39
That was wonderful.
20:40
Tell me about that church.
20:40
What was that church like?
20:41
Oh,
20:43
it was a
20:46
great church because the minister there had been an Episcopalian minister.
20:58
He had a very quiet church, and he had a church that was strictly—his
21:10
sermons were based on scripture.
21:14
The music were hymns and the people liked my aunt and uncle.
21:23
They liked me.
21:26
I would say it was kind of what you’d classify as maybe economically
21:32
above-average, if you can
21:42
call it above-average.
21:45
I think that’s what it was.
21:48
Was that church mixed or just mainly Whites or African Americans?
21:53
It was mainly African Americans.
21:53
There
21:58
were a few
22:02
other races.
22:06
There were a few Africans at the
22:11
time.
22:11
That’s all I can remember.
22:17
When—I know you got married eventually.
22:19
Oh yes.
22:21
If we keep going along with your life—so, you went through your,
22:26
you had your university education.
22:29
While I was getting my education I also met my husband and married and
22:37
really enjoyed Portland even more [laughs] , because I met my Aunt Velma’s
22:49
family, and plus I had the new family of Hammonds and Parkers and it
22:56
was great.
22:57
When did you get married?
23:01
In, hmm, that’s why I said I almost need a chronology,
23:11
a written chronology, so I can think.
23:13
I got married in,
23:17
I said, before ‘50, but it was married in ’60, 1960.
23:20
In 1960.
23:21
Mm-hmm.
23:24
Then,
23:28
you and your husband then looked for a place to live?
23:31
We did.
23:32
We did.
23:34
We found a very nice place in Portland, of course.
23:40
Couldn’t too far from my aunt and uncle [laughs]
23:47
. Let’s see, our first house was on 14th street, kind of in the Grant School area.
23:57
That was nice.
23:58
Now, that area was all of one ethnicity, now it’s a primarily White neighborhood.
24:12
It was interesting because to the east, west, north, and south
24:18
they knew that we were coming
24:23
[laughs] . We walked down the block, and “Hi, Mrs. Hammond.” In my heart, I
24:29
would think, strange. I don’t know you.
24:33
It was the time when
24:38
people, realtors,
24:43
got permission for African Americans
24:52
to move into certain neighborhoods.
24:52
So, I discovered that they knew who we were and it was great.
25:00
So, the realtors had notified, I guess before the people
25:05
before you sold the house—
25:07
That’s right!
25:08
—the realtors had notified the other neighbors?
25:13
Had “gotten permission” [scare quote gesture] for us to
25:18
move into that neighborhood.
25:22
Then, tell me about how your relations with the neighbors were?
25:26
Just great.
25:27
Next door to me lived a
25:32
lady who had been the first land-owner of huge land.
25:41
She owned, let’s see,
25:47
farms, just lots of farms.
25:50
She had been the first banker in Oregon.
25:55
She was one of the first persons to
26:01
invite, what do you call the people who ride horses?
26:08
Hmm,
26:12
gee, I’ve lost it.
26:15
I can’t remember.
26:17
He was a jockey.
26:19
A jockey?
26:20
I got it!
26:21
Ah!
26:22
Don’t lock me up, yet!
26:25
Okay, he was a jockey.
26:28
She had sponsored him.
26:32
That proved to be our asset.
26:36
She sponsored him and when he was not grooming horses, training
26:42
horses, riding horses and needed some additional things to do, she
26:48
would send him—go help the Hammonds.
26:54
I found in those years here in Oregon [break in recording]
27:00
. Okay, so you were talking about the jockey who would come over and help.
27:08
Yes.
27:08
What kind of things did he do?
27:10
Oh, he would—oh, this was.
27:13
Oh, about 2, 3 years after we moved there.
27:18
He’d come over.
27:20
He would walk Dwayne.
27:25
Back then, let’s
27:30
see, he might take Dwayne out in his stroller and go around the block.
27:37
Those were the days when you could
27:42
have faith that people were being okay, were good people.
27:46
He was wonderful.
27:47
Dwayne would
27:50
go with Mrs. Cooper’s friend, and
27:56
take Dwayne for a walk.
27:59
My husband had a joke, because Mrs. Cooper liked to talk even more than me,
28:06
and Wil said, okay, it’s your turn to go outside and talk with Mrs. Cooper.
28:14
She was waiting for us to come out the door so she could have a conversation.
28:22
She was a wonderful person: Marie Bernette Cooper, was one
28:28
of the first bankers in Oregon.
28:35
What about other neighbors?
28:38
Was there any negative things?
28:41
Really, when I think about it,
28:48
that’s why I’m so often shocked when someone says they want to
28:52
interview me, because I was like,
28:59
I had the most enjoyable time.
28:59
I did.
29:00
I didn’t
29:08
anticipate that, I guess coming from New Orleans we “knew our place”
29:18
[scare quotes gesture] , I didn’t go into situations where problems were.
29:26
I was very comfortable in my neighborhood.
29:31
I love gardening.
29:31
My husband and I worked in our yard and enjoyed our yard
29:36
and we were enjoyed by people.
29:40
That’s wonderful.
29:42
Now, let’s go and talk about when you started getting your first job.
29:49
Oh.
29:51
Okay.
29:53
Let’s go through your whole career, from
29:58
the beginning when you got your, was your first job when you were an MA or
30:03
did you have jobs when you were younger?
30:07
When I came to Oregon
30:13
I sent my resume.
30:18
I applied for a teaching position.
30:27
I do recall personnel lost my application.
30:35
I was offered a position, and I said, well, my application is here.
30:50
I found out what—I’m stuttering, uh.
30:54
Must be a
30:59
not-so-pleasant topic, because
31:05
when I heard of an opening at Highland School, I applied for it, but none
31:16
of my papers were at the personnel.
31:21
I said, oh, all my papers were sent
31:27
from Dillard and from LSU.
31:30
It’s, no.
31:32
Couldn’t find them.
31:33
I said, well, it was identified that I needed to
31:44
take Oregon history.
31:47
I had to take Oregon history, because, of course, coming from Louisiana, I didn’t
31:51
have Oregon history, and geography.
31:54
I
31:57
had to
31:59
take those.
31:59
I went to Portland State and took those.
32:05
Anyway, district couldn’t find it.
32:12
At first, I got hired without all of my papers.
32:21
I will not say what happened, but they were lost.
32:26
But they hired you.
32:28
They hired me, and I completed another set.
32:35
What was that work experience like?
32:39
Work experience was at Highland School teaching second grade.
32:47
I was, it was great.
32:51
I was the youngest one on the staff.
32:55
It was good, a great experience, for me
33:00
anyway.
33:01
For them, I don’t know.
33:03
The principal was pleasant.
33:06
The staff was ready to help me, you know, get acquainted, get adjusted.
33:19
I guess, I’d have to say some were not.
33:26
What were, again, some kinds of examples of some of the kind of positive relations?
33:32
Some of the examples of—
33:34
Negative.
33:34
—some of the negatives.
33:35
Negative was a first grade teacher stating that I had beautiful
33:41
skin but no pores [laughs]
33:44
. That was that person?
33:46
I thought that was a bit negative.
33:51
A
33:55
couple like that, you know.
33:57
Each day there was always someone who wanted to touch my hair or my face or
34:09
my skin because they had never, they claimed they just had not
34:15
been afforded that opportunity by the other members of the staff or neighborhood
34:23
who were ethnically different.
34:26
It didn’t bother me.
34:29
I said, this is, can I charge you?
34:34
I said, on Thursdays I’ll allow folks to touch my hair.
34:41
I found that making jokes, and I passed this to a lot of folks who come into
34:51
an ethnically different area, if you can find something to laugh about
35:01
you probably will make a happier entry if you can.
35:09
If you can laugh about it, or, then I think it becomes negative,
35:19
saddening, you can’t approach it.
35:19
Some of these things
35:25
when I go back and think about them, I think my brain dismisses them
35:31
because I find it just not pleasant and I find if I retain them, they
35:39
make me older and uglier and frown and so, I’m a deeply spiritual person.
35:52
I pray to God to give me strength to go through, to
35:57
maintain, to sustain during all
36:06
of these things.
36:07
I ask God to walk with me and be with me.
36:14
That’s it, really.
36:16
Sometimes I have to go into corners and cry and
36:24
put on my helmet and come to face it [laughs] . Or,
36:32
if I don’t want to do that, then I remove myself from the situation,
36:41
because, yes, when I really, intensely think about it, there
36:46
were many that I thought unkind.
36:51
I called them ignorant responses.
36:56
Most times, you
37:00
hate because you haven’t allowed yourself to find out about that person, and
37:08
we tend to hate things we don’t know.
37:13
I may not want to
37:16
interact with you, sit by, if I don’t know you.
37:19
But if I take time to get to know you, who knows?
37:25
I may find out that we have something in common.
37:29
I may find out there’s something you know and I need to learn.
37:35
That’s,
37:38
I guess, is kind of the epistle of Gerry—if you want to get along, then learn
37:47
more about the person and don’t condemn them until you’ve gotten to know them.
37:57
Then, I have a real reason for not liking you
38:04
[laughs] . Or loving you, whatever.
38:08
That’s my philosophy.
38:09
I call it the Epistle of Gerry.
38:15
Continue, then, you were an elementary school teacher, and then—
38:19
Second grade.
38:21
Second grade.
38:22
I know you advanced and advanced.
38:25
I did.
38:27
Tell us more.
38:28
I told someone, you know, I’ve always been, God puts me in the
38:35
right place holding the right credential [laughs] . That sounds
38:41
funny, but it’s almost been that way.
38:46
Many jobs I didn’t even—one, second grade, yes.
38:52
I wanted it, but someone asked me if I would take it.
39:02
I took it.
39:05
While I was teaching second grade, someone wrote a television program about
39:20
Bucky Beaver, and I thought.
39:22
Oh, yeah, I would like to
39:26
do that.
39:27
That’s one I was asked to apply for.
39:31
I applied for Bucky Beaver, and I didn’t get it because I was too primary.
39:41
I appealed to younger children, and this was intermediate, upper.
39:48
It said, but, we’ll write one.
39:51
We like your
39:55
charisma.
39:57
We like your style.
39:58
We like—you’re a great storyteller.
40:00
We’re going to write a program where we can utilize all these
40:07
traits and characteristics.
40:09
So, they wrote Mrs. Gerry and Friends.
40:16
They hired puppeteers.
40:17
They built Happy House, designed some puppets.
40:22
For two years, I was Mrs. Gerry.
40:28
Tell us more about that.
40:30
Just quickly, Mrs. Gerry went on walks around the community,
40:35
went on walks at the beach.
40:39
The
40:43
part of it that I liked, and apparently people liked also, I showed parents
40:48
and children how to appreciate their community, their world, and after I
40:57
walked and modeled how to do this, modeled how to look at a tree and
41:07
there’s more to know about it than the fact that it’s standing there.
41:11
Why is it standing there?
41:12
It has roots, etc. I could do that, and then after the children were
41:20
finished listening, I could tell the parents how to take that experience
41:27
and turn it into a teaching tool.
41:33
This was a regular public TV show?
41:36
Unfortunately, it was parallel to Batman
41:47
[laughs] . My son would say, I’m not watching you tonight.
41:50
I’m watching Batman.
41:51
That was punishment to me, I
41:58
guess.
41:58
Anyway, it came on Channel 7, and we taped it at KOPB.
42:09
That was by Benson High School in
42:16
Portland.
42:17
I visited schools.
42:21
That was a part of my responsibility and told them about the program.
42:28
I also brought my
42:33
photographer with me and we would visit different schools, take pictures
42:39
of the kids, Mrs. Gerry talking to them, use bits and pieces on the show.
42:46
How did the people accept you at the schools when you went
42:52
into those different schools?
42:55
They,
42:58
anything associated with films and photography and TV is welcomed.
43:06
So, here again, Mrs. Gerry was welcomed.
43:11
The show was welcomed and folks like to be photographed, so they were glad.
43:19
Ah!
43:19
She’s coming.
43:22
You went to all different kinds of schools.
43:24
I went to different schools.
43:27
We photographed children.
43:28
We photographed Mrs. Gerry talking to the principal, the cook, the custodian,
43:36
different things.
43:39
After that, what did you do?
43:45
Well,
43:47
after I did television
43:52
someone offered an administrative credential at
43:59
University of Oregon, so I went to University of Oregon because our
44:08
contract was over with Mrs. Gerry.
44:12
We sold Mrs. Gerry to
44:19
Hawaii [laughs] . Mrs. Gerry was sold to Hawaii schools and to Samoa,
44:21
because Samoa didn’t have schools.
44:21
They had a district, and so
44:38
Mrs. Gerry could teach reading and it would be shown to all
44:47
of the islands.
44:48
They didn’t need Mrs. Gerry.
44:50
They just needed Mrs. Gerry’s film.
44:54
That was one thing.
44:55
Then I went to the University of Oregon and was there, I think,
45:02
1 or 2 years, a couple of years, and got administrative credential,
45:09
came back, ready to be a principal.
45:13
Now, you’re at the University of Oregon.
45:18
Let’s compare that to the other schools you were in.
45:23
At that time were there other African Americans?
45:26
What was the scene like there?
45:28
The timing was perfect.
45:28
What years was that?
45:30
Ah—that’s a good question.
45:34
I’ll have to think about that.
45:37
But, the timing was good.
45:40
There was a lady at
45:46
the University of Portland, not, University of Oregon, Ducks, sorry.
45:49
There
45:55
were a lot of
46:00
opportunities for green berets, all of them.
46:06
Lots of opportunities for ethnic groups to be educated.
46:12
Title I, Chapter I—the government was offering educational
46:21
opportunities for people of color, for Hispanics, for Indians.
46:28
So,
46:30
the University of Oregon campus had all of these groups.
46:38
It just so happened that Dr. Pearl was associated with psychology,
46:44
and so I kind of aligned with
46:50
him
46:55
and got some programs started.
46:58
What programs?
47:01
History of American Education as an inclusive program showing that
47:08
many groups contributed to education and all of it was not negative.
47:18
It was positive.
47:22
We did this, what was happening in the northwest, what were our contributions
47:31
to northwest history, all of them
47:39
weren’t negative.
47:39
There
47:42
were the Stokely Carmichaels, yes, but there were also the first pioneers
47:48
who came across and who settled.
47:52
There was George Washington Carver in Washington.
47:57
There’s a library that he and his family started.
48:01
There were many things.
48:03
Nobody just took time to search them.
48:08
That program, was that integrated into the history curriculum?
48:14
It was.
48:14
For the schools?
48:15
Then, lots of persons were taking courses in Black history, Indian history,
48:23
Spanish, Mexican American history.
48:27
That was the time.
48:31
It was good to be an administrator to head some
48:39
of these programs.
48:40
It was a good time to be alive, I thought.
48:45
Then you became—then you got your degree at the University of Oregon that prepared
48:53
you to be able to be a principal.
48:55
Got a master’s degree in administration.
48:59
Came back and was principal of Wilcox School in Portland.
49:10
How as the process of getting that job?
49:12
Was it difficult?
49:14
No [laughs] . It was not, because that was a time when districts were
49:22
wanting to “integrate” [scare quote gesture] their schools, their district,
49:30
the token, trying to have African Americans be a part of their staffs.
49:41
How did you feel about being the token?
49:44
The token?
49:45
[Said simultaneously] Well, I’ll tell you a joke, actually.
49:50
Let me tell you this one.
49:55
Portland was sending teachers to all—sending African American
50:03
teachers to all White schools so they could “integrate” [scare
50:08
quotes gesture] the staff.
50:11
I was at this school.
50:13
I was the only Black in a community on the
50:18
staff, and one family lived in area.
50:25
This was a way to show you how things differed.
50:28
This one boy was about second, third grade, I recall.
50:34
He loved his teacher.
50:37
The family was accepted.
50:41
I was the newcomer.
50:43
I had to crawl and make my way.
50:48
There was a little boy who was bussed in.
50:55
He did not like being there.
50:59
no one played with him.
51:01
When I’d go out on the playground he would find me and hold my hand, walk with me.
51:08
He’d say, Mrs. Gerry, he said, we’ve got to leave this place.
51:14
I said, why?
51:18
Do you like your teacher?
51:19
She’s okay.
51:21
He’d say, but ain’t nobody here but you and me
51:28
[laughs] . I’d say, well, please.
51:30
He said, I’m going back to my school.
51:33
He didn’t think it was his school.
51:36
I said, oh please don’t.
51:38
I said, if you leave I’ll be here all by myself [laughs] . Eventually, though, he
51:48
did stop coming.
51:50
I called
51:55
his parents and asked why he was not at school.
51:57
She said, he was unhappy.
51:59
He
52:04
liked the program, the curriculum, but no one played with him
52:07
when he was on the playground.
52:10
He just walked with Mrs. Gerry.
52:15
I guess that gives you kind of a feel for what it was like when there was just one.
52:22
I think anywhere, when there are not persons that you have something in common
52:35
with, maybe that’s it.
52:36
I’ll tell you another story.
52:39
At the same time, remember we had moved to, we moved from Portland to Salem.
52:50
We moved to Salem.
52:52
It was interesting.
52:55
It was the year that my oldest was a senior at Benson High School.
53:04
The youngest was a sixth grader.
53:13
When I went around, my husband and I, looking for schools the principal here
53:22
where Dwayne was going to attend school, he said, what school is he attending?
53:28
I said, Benson.
53:29
He said, oh, no he’s not going to want to leave Benson High School
53:35
to attend any school anywhere.
53:40
Tell
53:43
us something about that.
53:43
Benson Polytechnic School was then one of the well-rated schools in Oregon.
53:51
They called it Benson Polytechnic because you could take academically advanced
54:00
classes or you could take technical training: math, science, mechanics.
54:11
It was a well—you had to get permission to attend Benson.
54:18
It was an all-boys school.
54:22
So, Dwayne didn’t want to change from Benson, so we let him stay at
54:35
Benson.
54:35
Lenny attended Morningside.
54:39
We purchased this house and we thought we’ll buy a house.
54:44
We had good resale value if we get sick of this place.
54:52
Anyway, Lionel went to Morningside Elementary.
55:01
That’s in Salem.
55:02
That’s in Salem, about 2 blocks from here.
55:05
He liked it because—we’ve talked about this now that he’s all
55:10
grown—because he had friends
55:17
that wanted him
55:22
to come when school starts, come one this is where we’re going to attend school.
55:28
Everybody awaited him.
55:32
The principal said, I love Lenny.
55:35
I wish I could clone him.
55:39
We thought it was a great idea.
55:41
Nobody had ever said they wanted to clone
56:00
Dwayne.
56:00
Both of my kids were academically good, but Lenny had one other factor.
56:02
He was musically gifted.
56:02
I had two gifted kids, but they wanted Lenny as a part of their chorus.
56:07
They wanted Lenny as a part of their foursquare ball game [laughs] . One
56:19
day, I’m told, that the counselor said, hey Lenny I have a young man who’s
56:26
coming to our school, a young man Colin.
56:32
I wish you could come and talk to him.
56:35
He doesn’t like it here.
56:37
He said, Lenny told him, oh.
56:41
I wish I could help you but I’m not
56:45
a counselor
56:49
[laughs] . Plus, I don’t know him.
56:54
Plus, what does he like to do?
56:58
Find out what he likes to do.
57:01
We tried him on our foursquare team.
57:04
He can’t kick the ball.
57:10
So, he didn’t make it.
57:14
The school here.
57:15
Describe that school.
57:16
Was it mainly all White?
57:18
or Mixed?
57:18
Here?
57:19
Yeah.
57:20
The school was—yes.
57:26
You look at pictures.
57:28
There’s Lenny.
57:28
You’d say, which one is Lenny?
57:31
I would say, really?
57:35
You are joking.
57:38
Anyway, you can tell where Lenny is and he was a part of jazz, etc. You
57:43
could tell where Lenny was located when he was in middle school and high
57:51
school, but he was always in some music group or he was a fast runner.
58:03
So, he
58:06
excelled in chasing relays.
58:08
School was okay for him, but if you talk to
58:18
Lenny he says, mother, they liked me because you were principal in
58:21
the district and they wanted to associate with me because there was
58:27
a swimming pool and we had a hot tub.
58:30
I
58:33
don’t’ think it was me.
58:35
It was the things we had.
58:40
I found that out when I got older.
58:45
Now let’s continue, so you were principal and I know you developed further things
58:53
in your career that were very important.
58:56
Yes,
59:01
and no, yes.
59:08
I belonged, I’m a talker, here, there, but I became a part of
59:18
the Human Rights and Relations
59:23
Committee at the district level.
59:26
At the school district?
59:29
School district, Salem,
59:34
Kaiser.
59:35
We had some problems.
59:37
There was one family that had problems at the time.
59:44
The lady came to the schoolboard and complained.
59:51
Then she went to the,
59:56
well, she complained there because her son was having, was dating a
1:00:08
young girl, white girl, and folks from the Aryan Nations attacked him.
1:00:16
Just beat him to a pulp.
1:00:19
The lady was very concerned about that because she had attended
1:00:25
school in Salem and she said things were not getting better.
1:00:30
They were just as bad.
1:00:32
She was talking about race relations.
1:00:35
She said, they’re just as bad.
1:00:38
People do not respect people.
1:00:42
People do not want to be associated with anyone except someone who looks like them.
1:00:52
She said, it’s bad.
1:00:54
What’s going to happen?
1:00:56
It was
1:00:59
one of those nights that I had come to attend the meeting, city council meeting,
1:01:10
and I think the mayor said, is there anyone in here who represents the schools?
1:01:22
I looked around, just as he was looking around, because I knew I
1:01:28
was the only one there representing.
1:01:31
I was not representing schools.
1:01:34
I was a member of the community who was a part of Human Rights
1:01:40
and Relations Committee who happened to be in the audience.
1:01:47
Anyway,
1:01:51
while taping was going on someone pointed to me and said, oh, there’s
1:01:58
somebody from the school district.
1:02:00
What do you have to say about this?
1:02:03
I thought, me?
1:02:05
And some other things that I care not to repeat.
1:02:12
I walked down to the mic, and I said, well we’re aware that there are problems.
1:02:20
I said, it’s a community problem.
1:02:26
Folks have difficulty getting along, wanting to meet with people
1:02:32
who are not like themselves.
1:02:35
I said, and the school district, Salem Kaiser School District, our
1:02:41
superintendent, Dr. Kerr, we’re aware of
1:02:47
that.
1:02:47
We are planning curriculum that will bring people together that will value diversity.
1:03:00
I don’t know what—that’s one of things that God puts in your mind
1:03:06
quickly because you’re on camera.
1:03:09
It was unfortunate that our superintendent was listening to the city council meeting.
1:03:21
He called my house that night and said, oh, bravo.
1:03:27
I’m so happy to know that we’re doing all of those things [laughs] . I’m
1:03:33
laughing because he also said 7:00 tomorrow morning I’d like to see
1:03:39
you in my office so we can put this curriculum together that values
1:03:46
diversity and wants inclusion.
1:03:55
What a great idea.
1:03:55
I said, look.
1:03:55
I was trying to save your hide
1:04:00
[laughs]
1:04:03
. We laugh about that a lot.
1:04:06
Well, next thing I know, I became the coordinator of multicultural
1:04:12
education, and I was planning a curriculum of inclusion.
1:04:22
Tell us something about that curriculum.
1:04:25
We met the whole weekend and designed it.
1:04:30
It was years and years and years ago.
1:04:33
The curriculum was good.
1:04:33
One of the things that, let me stoop down here for a minute.
1:04:33
I just have some [reaches down beside chair] , let’s
1:04:44
open up these books.
1:04:47
Maybe I gave it to you.
1:04:49
A little green book?
1:04:53
Red, purple, I don’t know.
1:04:57
But, I guess I’ll tell you about it.
1:05:03
What
1:05:07
we did
1:05:11
was to identify activities for different grade levels for different groups.
1:05:15
We decided if we’re going to do something we’re going to do it in a big way.
1:05:22
It was a curriculum of
1:05:26
inclusion so that people would begin to know your neighbor,
1:05:32
identify pros and cons.
1:05:35
Are there good things about you your neighbor needs to know?
1:05:41
Not so good?
1:05:44
Whatever.
1:05:45
I developed some booklets for kids at every grade level to
1:05:52
have activities about all groups.
1:05:56
Do you remember what some of those activities were?
1:06:00
No.
1:06:02
Of course I do.
1:06:04
We had kids,
1:06:09
every day, somewhere, somebody is celebrating something in some country.
1:06:19
I would identify that.
1:06:24
Like, Indians are celebrating.
1:06:28
An Asian person is celebrating, and we need to know that.
1:06:35
Ah!
1:06:37
I have to find that book.
1:06:42
But, I had artwork.
1:06:45
I had
1:06:48
stories, and kids from grades 1 through 6, high school was given book lists, every
1:07:00
group was given a packet of books to put in their libraries on other groups, and
1:07:14
I did workshops for the policemen.
1:07:19
I did workshops for the state department.
1:07:21
That’s how we tried to educate everyone.
1:07:21
Did
1:07:32
you see any changes as that developed?
1:07:34
At that time.
1:07:37
I’m not sure.
1:07:38
We did not test to see how well it continued to
1:07:48
grow, like yeast.
1:07:51
But, like yeast, it affected the whole dough, the whole bread.
1:07:59
Everybody starting having inclusive parties.
1:08:04
I even spoke at churches, and
1:08:09
I remember one minister said, yeah.
1:08:13
We had a Hispanic family in our
1:08:21
congregation.
1:08:21
I don’t know what happened to them.
1:08:26
I said,
1:08:28
that’s what we’re trying to bring to your attention.
1:08:31
You need to know what happened to them.
1:08:34
Why did they leave your congregation?
1:08:36
I guess that’s
1:08:38
it.
1:08:44
When thinking about what’s going on now, and thinking about that curriculum,
1:08:52
do you think that that’s still the kind of curriculum that’s needed?
1:08:56
I do.
1:08:57
Or, there’s some new things that need to be added that you have ideas for?
1:09:02
I do.
1:09:04
You know, so much of everything is dependent on money.
1:09:08
It cost us beaucoups of money to prep those books.
1:09:14
It cost beaucoups of money to hold those workshops.
1:09:21
Districts are trying to get money to buy reading books and math books and
1:09:27
English books, and so unless the teacher has that X factor that makes her want to
1:09:41
teach her kids how to value diversity, it just doesn’t happen.
1:09:48
It saddens me, really, because it like an X factor, unless I
1:09:58
feel inside of me my God-given
1:10:05
X factor is to love everyone,
1:10:12
it won’t happen.
1:10:14
You cannot say the law says you must get along.
1:10:22
It just doesn’t happen.
1:10:22
That’s the Epistle of Gerry.
1:10:27
I don’t think it’s going to happen until people—you can’t legislate, King said,
1:10:35
not King, but someone who worked width King, said this, and he was speaking at
1:10:46
Willamette, he said, you can’t legislate
1:10:53
people to get along.
1:10:56
That’s true.
1:10:58
We have to desire, because if I want to get along with you, maybe
1:11:05
your boss doesn’t want that.
1:11:12
You know?
1:11:12
It’s just a worldwide inner feeling that you have to learn to
1:11:20
love, get along, or we all die.
1:11:28
Going from there, you worked with a lot of different people—
1:11:34
Hmm?
1:11:35
You have worked with many different people.
1:11:42
Ethnicities.
1:11:43
I’ve enjoyed that.
1:11:43
Mm-hmm.
1:11:43
In terms of your friendships, did you become friends with some of the people
1:11:48
that you worked with and do social things with them outside of work?
1:11:53
I find that you teach kindergarten kids to come into the classroom
1:12:02
and they all play together.
1:12:04
You don’t have to say, go play with Johnny.
1:12:07
Don’t play with Sue.
1:12:09
They all just come in and play and hug and get along.
1:12:16
I read the paper one day a little boy in kindergarten
1:12:21
kissed, kissed, a little girl, in kindergarten and they suspended him.
1:12:30
I’m going, what?
1:12:33
That’s a form of love.
1:12:36
You watch that.
1:12:38
You let him know how far are we going with this?
1:12:43
That’s nice.
1:12:44
There’s nothing wrong with that.
1:12:45
I hug you, too.
1:12:45
As
1:12:50
an adult now, do you have friends that you do social things with that
1:12:54
are both White and African Americans?
1:12:57
Well, I live in Salem
1:13:02
[laughs] . That’s kind of a joke.
1:13:05
Yes.
1:13:06
I do.
1:13:08
I belong to a church.
1:13:10
If you ever come to visit Morningside, it’s, oh
1:13:15
there’s Gerry!
1:13:20
I’m there.
1:13:25
Tell me, then, we want to kind of tie up here your career,
1:13:33
so then you became principal.
1:13:35
I became principal, years later the school district, the school board,
1:13:44
decided they were going to build new schools, and they wanted to build
1:13:51
schools for persons who had contributed to the welfare of the district.
1:14:04
They put a ballot in the paper and said can you think of someone?
1:14:11
Remember, I was training police and school district and university, so the name
1:14:21
that they could recall—oh, Geraldine!
1:14:26
Then
1:14:29
this name came up and the board says, oh we can’t name a school for Geraldine
1:14:35
because she’s still alive [laughs]
1:14:42
. That information was given, oh Geraldine you were honored.
1:14:48
Folks wanted to name a school after you but we can’t because you’re still alive.
1:14:53
I said, I told the newspaper, don’t print it, but yes I am!
1:15:03
I’m honored that they wanted to do that, but I’m not dying for that honor
1:15:12
[laughs] . Sorry, if you can’t change it.
1:15:17
I just won’t receive that honor.
1:15:21
Then,
1:15:23
[laughs] people start saying why not?
1:15:28
Why can’t we name a school for someone who’s still alive.
1:15:34
Somehow they changed that.
1:15:38
So, Hammond Elementary exists in north Salem.
1:15:45
Beautiful.
1:15:46
I shoveled the first scoop of dirt.
1:15:52
That’s where they celebrate your birthdays.
1:15:55
Yes!
1:15:55
[laughs] Yes, yes, yes.
1:15:59
I’m so pleased.
1:16:00
Tell us about those birthday celebrations.
1:16:04
[Laughs] You’d have to get a tape.
1:16:09
I’ll share a tape with
1:16:13
you.
1:16:13
It depends.
1:16:13
It depends on the principal.
1:16:16
It depends on the staff.
1:16:17
I’ll tell you about the—the kids sing songs.
1:16:27
The music teacher writes acrostic
1:16:33
that says “G is for, and E is for...” and the kids sing it.
1:16:38
The music department claps and they twist, and everything.
1:16:45
I sit there crying, laughing, and twisting.
1:16:50
It’s wonderful.
1:16:52
The kids read little things.
1:16:55
The PTA, the parent teachers association, the parents bring food and the
1:17:04
staff room they all have a spread.
1:17:08
I wouldn’t want to miss it.
1:17:11
I stay alive so I can eat all this.
1:17:16
That’s it.
1:17:17
That’s wonderful.
1:17:18
It is.
1:17:20
Yes.
1:17:22
The first year
1:17:26
CCTV taped it.
1:17:28
I have a copy of that.
1:17:31
It’s just great.
1:17:34
One year, the kids, you look on my piano, someone, I like flamingos, so
1:17:44
someone drew a picture of this huge flamingo, and every kid got to put thread
1:17:51
around and then they outlined it with nails and every kid did a nail and a
1:18:01
thumbprint to fill in this whole flamingo.
1:18:06
That’s what I’m telling you.
1:18:09
You get what you look for.
1:18:12
I look for positive things in people.
1:18:19
I find them.
1:18:21
I enjoy them.
1:18:22
I try to love most people.
1:18:28
I have a few that I have to really look hard, but most of them,
1:18:34
if I keep looking I find it.
1:18:39
I wish more people would look for something good.
1:18:46
My grandma told me something once.
1:18:48
She said, there’s so much good
1:18:53
in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us that it doesn’t behoove
1:19:04
any of us to talk about the rest of us.
1:19:10
That’s it.
1:19:12
We’re good.
1:19:13
We’re bad.
1:19:17
I’m like the little girl.
1:19:19
I have a little curl.
1:19:21
When I’m good, I’m very, very good.
1:19:24
When I’m bad, I’m horrid.
1:19:28
Tell us something about your social life.
1:19:31
What are your interests outside of work?
1:19:33
What do you like to do for fun?
1:19:36
I was hoping you wouldn’t ask me that [laughs] . Let me see how I can put it.
1:19:45
I love church.
1:19:48
I try to say that.
1:19:49
I pray.
1:19:52
I pray.
1:19:53
I pray.
1:19:56
But, I also like to go to casino
1:20:02
[laughs] . That’s my negative.
1:20:03
I’m sorry, but I do.
1:20:08
So,
1:20:12
I go to church, and when I get a chance I go to casino, but I praise
1:20:18
God all of the time, every day.
1:20:23
Church—the two Cs: church and casino.
1:20:27
[Gasps] Shame on you!
1:20:29
But that is correct [laughs] . I never thought of it that way.
1:20:34
Sorry.
1:20:35
Sorry.
1:20:37
I hope no one else thinks, hears you.
1:20:42
Geraldine Hammond loves the two C’s
1:20:50
[laughs]
1:20:50
. Besides that?
1:20:54
Besides that for what you—
1:20:56
I love people.
1:20:58
I do.
1:20:59
I truly love
1:21:04
people.
1:21:05
I love canasta, because I don’t know.
1:21:08
I love canasta versus bridge.
1:21:12
In bridge, you play—bridge is a card game.
1:21:13
I remember my mom and dad played bridge and you had to be quiet
1:21:19
because someone’s thinking.
1:21:21
With canasta, I can forget what I played last and someone will
1:21:29
say, oh, hey it’s your turn.
1:21:31
It is?
1:21:32
Who led?
1:21:34
Who played?
1:21:34
You know?
1:21:36
I enjoy any situation—I love cooking.
1:21:40
I love gardening.
1:21:42
You look outside, right now, I’ve got some hyacinth that I really love.
1:21:50
My tulips—I love my plants.
1:21:54
I’ll have roses everywhere.
1:21:56
I love gardening.
1:21:59
Cooking, I make the best gumbo.
1:22:02
Ah-ha, because you’re from Louisiana.
1:22:04
From Louisiana.
1:22:06
I can make gumbo
1:22:12
and jambalaya.
1:22:13
Those are my greatest.
1:22:17
I love God.
1:22:19
Because I love God, I love the people he made.
1:22:23
Do you have many friends now?
1:22:25
I have friends.
1:22:30
I do.
1:22:32
Not as many as I want,
1:22:36
because, like me, they’re either dying or they’re not driving anymore, or
1:22:46
they’re sick or they’re weak, or they have husbands and nobody wants you
1:22:53
tagging along if they have their husband with them and you don’t have one.
1:23:03
That’s what’s happening to me now.
1:23:07
I think that’s—we all get older, that’s one of the—
1:23:11
You said a bad word.
1:23:13
You’re right.
1:23:14
Yes.
1:23:15
Older.
1:23:17
I like that.
1:23:19
We actually get younger.
1:23:21
I think we get more experienced.
1:23:24
Yes.
1:23:24
I
1:23:27
accept that.
1:23:27
Tell us more about your
1:23:38
family.
1:23:38
We really haven’t talked about that.
1:23:41
Oh!
1:23:41
I have two sons.
1:23:45
One worked at, lives in Kent, Washington, and worked as
1:23:55
assistant to a neurology department
1:24:02
and my other son lives in Portland, my
1:24:12
youngest.
1:24:12
He worked at Freightliner, but unfortunately both of them
1:24:19
now are not working because
1:24:30
both of them have a form of depression.
1:24:35
But they’re beautiful kids and they’re mine.
1:24:42
I’m a widow as I told you, so I just have my boys.
1:24:48
I have my sisters and brothers.
1:24:52
Only two of them have passed away, and we get together for cookouts
1:24:58
and we still have lots of fun.
1:25:04
Do they come here?
1:25:05
Where do they live?
1:25:07
I have one brother who lives in Georgia.
1:25:11
One brother lives in New Orleans.
1:25:14
Highlight—one brother played with Fats Domino.
1:25:19
Brother Ricky wrote music for
1:25:25
DeBarge Jazz Band.
1:25:27
Maddie sang, even with Portland Symphony.
1:25:34
Another sister, Mary Etta’s still singing.
1:25:40
Who did I leave out?
1:25:42
Two passed: Gwendolyn, Maddie, told you about Ricky.
1:25:48
Ronald
1:25:50
is in a care center.
1:25:52
He’s not well.
1:25:54
He was the drummer and singer of our family.
1:26:06
I have a nephew who went to University of Oregon and I told one
1:26:13
guy, he said, who’s your nephew?
1:26:15
I said, his name was Michael Callier.
1:26:19
He said, oh.
1:26:20
I said, he passed his law exam the first time
1:26:32
he took it.
1:26:33
He said, Michael Callier.
1:26:33
He said, that’s not why we know Michael Callier.
1:26:37
He made the winning tackle when we played Arizona and we hadn’t beat
1:26:46
Arizona in years and Michael gave us the winning [laughs] . He said,
1:26:56
that’s why we know Michael Callier.
1:26:58
Oh yeah, we accepted him to pass the exam.
1:26:59
We expected
1:27:04
him.
1:27:06
Michael was smart.
1:27:07
He had two scholarships: one in sports.
1:27:13
So, he did that and got his undergrad degree.
1:27:18
Then when he graduated he came back and got his law degree
1:27:24
with his academic scholarship.
1:27:26
That’s a highlight of our, I just had to sneak that one in
1:27:31
because I’m very proud of Michael.
1:27:34
Go,
1:27:41
Michael!
1:27:41
Let’s see, I told you about my boys.
1:27:44
I told you about my sisters and brothers.
1:27:46
I have one nephew, Dr. Ofhanson
1:27:52
von Spears
1:27:56
[?] . Another brag—A.C. Green went to my school.
1:28:01
He played basketball.
1:28:06
When I was principal at Willamette—no, principal, principal, principal...at
1:28:14
a school in Portland, he attended that school.
1:28:22
Yeah.
1:28:22
So, I’m proud of that.
1:28:26
He played basketball.
1:28:28
Do you have reunions of the family?
1:28:33
Do you know?
1:28:33
We don’t.
1:28:34
We don’t.
1:28:39
We have celebrations.
1:28:42
Tell us about some of the celebrations and how you celebrate.
1:28:45
If you, when’s your birthday?
1:28:48
March.
1:28:49
March 25th.
1:28:50
My husband’s birthday was, say, March 13th, and so we would say, ah!
1:28:56
Ruth!
1:28:57
Let’s celebrate Ruth’s birthday.
1:29:00
We’d all get together.
1:29:02
We have a piano here.
1:29:05
We have an organ.
1:29:06
We just drink and talk and laugh and lie and enjoy.
1:29:14
That’s what we all—
1:29:14
Do you have food?
1:29:14
What kind of food do you have?
1:29:14
Oh, we have food.
1:29:14
We might decide if
1:29:17
the,
1:29:25
let’s see—food.
1:29:27
Give me an example of one of the last birthdays—
1:29:30
Dishes?
1:29:31
or celebrations.
1:29:32
Okay.
1:29:32
Last birthday.
1:29:34
Describe the whole thing.
1:29:36
Oh, with Lionel.
1:29:37
Lionel’s birthday is May 11th.
1:29:43
He hates that, because that’s also Mother’s Day.
1:29:48
A lot of years, let’s say we’ll have his birthday.
1:29:52
Or, say, my birthday, October 13th.
1:29:56
Then, it’s celebrated at school and then the other day we’ll go to my timeshare
1:30:06
at Lincoln City and we’ll go there.
1:30:11
Or, he’ll come here to my house.
1:30:13
I’d rather celebrate at my house.
1:30:16
We’ll have gumbo.
1:30:18
We’ll have jambalaya.
1:30:21
Everybody else will bring dishes.
1:30:23
What kind of dishes?
1:30:25
You bring whatever dish.
1:30:27
We’ll say, Ruth, come on to the party.
1:30:30
You b ring something that represents your ethnicity.
1:30:36
You bring it.
1:30:37
So, we might have—one lady, I saw in the grocery store, and my folks laugh at me.
1:30:47
She said, aren’t you Mrs. Gerry?
1:30:51
I said, yes.
1:30:52
She said, I used to watch you when I was a little girl.
1:30:56
I said, you did?!
1:30:58
I said, oh, how wonderful.
1:31:01
I’d say, well, I’m having a party at my house.
1:31:05
We invited her to the party, and she was Pilipino.
1:31:13
You bring a dish that represents your culture.
1:31:17
We may have rolls.
1:31:21
We may have whatever represents.
1:31:24
We may have rice, wraps,
1:31:29
Thai food.
1:31:31
Oh, I love Thai barbeque.
1:31:34
We may have
1:31:37
that.
1:31:37
Somebody may bring a cake, whatever.
1:31:39
One lady brought sugar cookies.
1:31:43
Oh, that is so good, because my mother used to bake sugar
1:31:49
cookies when she was little.
1:31:52
We never know.
1:31:54
This table on my dining room is just filled with stuff.
1:32:01
When was the last—so, there was your birthday, but besides your birthday what
1:32:06
was the last celebration that you’ve had?
1:32:08
GH: Here at my house?
1:32:11
Yeah.
1:32:11
Hmm, I had a canasta party not that long ago.
1:32:17
I did,
1:32:22
had a canasta.
1:32:22
The folks just brought stuff.
1:32:28
When you have a canasta party, you play canasta, then you stop and eat?
1:32:33
Or you eat while you’re playing?
1:32:35
Depends on what you want to do.
1:32:38
But, yes, that’s what we
1:32:43
do.
1:32:44
As you grew up—let’s talk about,
1:32:50
let’s pick a particular holiday, like Christmas.
1:32:54
So, when you had Christmas when you were a child and you were
1:32:57
growing up in New Orleans, and then when you have Christmas here?
1:33:02
Were there differences?
1:33:03
What was the celebration like there?
1:33:06
What was the celebration like here?
1:33:08
Christmas in New Orleans.
1:33:12
Christmas at the Callier’s house.
1:33:18
It’s interesting that you would pick Christmas, because my father’s mother had
1:33:36
passed.
1:33:36
[phone rings] . I’ll just let it ring.
1:33:36
We would have Christmas, Christmas, Christmas—Christmas was a big thing.
1:33:42
We
1:33:44
had roast,
1:33:48
turkey, we had yams.
1:33:50
We had, at
1:33:54
our house, we had ham, we had roast.
1:33:58
We had rice.
1:34:00
We had rice in New Orleans.
1:34:02
You eat rice with everything.
1:34:05
Rice in gravy, dressing.
1:34:09
Yams, greens—you always have to have some kind of greens or
1:34:17
several kinds of greens.
1:34:19
You had—oh my mother would make frappe punch, that’s a big punch
1:34:26
bowl with—what did Mom put in there.
1:34:33
Oh, a gallon of ice cream, raspberry sherbet, and you pour
1:34:45
strawberry punch on top of it.
1:34:48
It’s good.
1:34:52
On the stove there’s a big pot of...
1:34:57
huh.
1:34:58
What?
1:35:02
Eggnog.
1:35:04
Christmas, you said, so it’s winter.
1:35:06
There’s this cold drink of frappe punch, but then for others there’s this eggnog.
1:35:17
I guess that’s enough.
1:35:19
All tables and several cakes.
1:35:24
That’s about it.
1:35:25
We exchange gifts.
1:35:26
Then
1:35:29
the whole different members of the family brought food?
1:35:33
Maybe.
1:35:34
How was it organized?
1:35:35
You came whether you brought some or not.
1:35:39
I was thinking—whose home it was?
1:35:41
Was that person responsible for everything?
1:35:43
At Christmas in New Orleans it was at my mom and dad’s house.
1:35:49
Here in Oregon, it was first at Aunt Velma and Uncle Phil's house.
1:35:56
Then, we had a large house, so it was our house.
1:36:01
Tell us about the Christmas first at your aunt and uncle’s and then the one here.
1:36:06
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
1:36:06
I know one year Christmas
1:36:13
was funny I had learned to make rolls, so I made rolls
1:36:23
for everyone.
1:36:23
I thought I was so good at making rising yeast rolls.
1:36:27
Then I give them half-baked rolls for Christmas.
1:36:34
It started with Aunt Velma and Uncle Phil coming and I gave
1:36:38
them their half-baked rolls.
1:36:41
All you had to do was take it home and stick it in the oven.
1:36:44
Uncle Phil said, hey, why not put on a pot of coffee and finish baking my rolls?
1:36:48
We can eat them.
1:36:57
So, we did.
1:36:57
We ate Uncle Phil's rolls.
1:37:01
Then Mom and Dad came, and I was going to give them their half-baked rolls,
1:37:08
but Uncle Phil said that’s not fair.
1:37:11
You all ate my rolls!
1:37:14
I think
1:37:17
we should cool Olivia and Ed’s rolls, so we can eat those.
1:37:19
Velma had cooked a ham, I mean from scratch.
1:37:25
So, she said, it’s been great if we had some meat to
1:37:34
go with this bread.
1:37:34
So, Velma went home.
1:37:35
She didn’t live far, brought the ham, and we at
1:37:40
that.
1:37:41
Our Christmases were just comfortable.
1:37:44
The next day, food was all like half gone
1:37:53
[laughs] . The only thing that was happening at our house, the kids were
1:37:58
playing with their toys and the adults were sleeping [laughs] . That’s a
1:38:00
kind of Christmas that was different.
1:38:00
That’s nice.
1:38:00
I’m
1:38:09
going to
1:38:14
change the subject a little bit.
1:38:16
Of course, you were here during all the
1:38:21
Civil Rights Movement.
1:38:25
Did you participate in the Civil Rights activities and how did you participate?
1:38:31
Can you tell
1:38:47
us something about that?
1:38:47
A couple of different ways.
1:38:47
I remember going to Woolworth when I first came here.
1:38:51
The Civil Rights Movement was going on.
1:38:56
Woolworth was segregated.
1:38:56
I recall sitting at the end of the counter—that’s where
1:39:07
you had to sit.
1:39:10
So, we sat there and had hot dogs or something because we
1:39:16
couldn’t go to the other end.
1:39:20
I recall that.
1:39:22
That’s here in Oregon.
1:39:25
I remember in New Orleans during the Civil Rights Movement—it depends
1:39:33
on what year we’re talking about.
1:39:36
There’s different years.
1:39:37
Why don’t you specify the year and tell us?
1:39:40
Being at Dillard—I was attending Dillard ’49 to ’53.
1:39:43
Go
1:39:55
back a little.
1:39:58
When we rode the
1:40:03
St. Charles Street car,
1:40:07
there was a wooden placket that you had to place in a hole in the back of the seats.
1:40:18
If you got it.
1:40:20
St. Charles Street car.
1:40:22
Many, many seats.
1:40:24
On the back of the seat, here [gestures to headrest area of recliner] two
1:40:29
holds and a placard that said “for colored only.” You stuck that [gestures
1:40:35
behind head] and you sat in the seats beyond it, even if they had many
1:40:42
vacancies. You couldn’t sit in them.
1:40:46
You had to sit beyond this placard.
1:40:50
I can recall
1:40:54
as a youngster we would take that placard and drop
1:41:03
it out the window.
1:41:04
That was not nice.
1:41:05
That’s a negative, because the law said you had this and you sit.
1:41:09
What happened as a
1:41:14
result of doing that?
1:41:16
The conductor reported it to our principal and she reprimanded, don’t do that.
1:41:29
And we stopped doing it for a while.
1:41:32
Then we started dropping them out the window again.
1:41:36
That was not
1:41:40
nice.
1:41:42
I remember Gilbert Academy was located—that’s the private
1:41:46
high school I attended.
1:41:51
It was supported by the
1:41:58
Methodist Black Americans.
1:41:59
I attended that school.
1:42:06
The city always wanted to get rid of it, but couldn’t because
1:42:13
it had been there, established during right after the Civil War.
1:42:18
It had been there all these years.
1:42:21
My class of
1:42:30
1948... was the last class to graduate from that school and they closed
1:42:38
it and made it a White boys school.
1:42:48
Now there’s a big placard that says, Gilbert Academy, first
1:42:56
school for colored students.
1:43:01
Yeah.
1:43:03
Talking about the Civil Rights Movement, hm.
1:43:16
There were many things, but specifically I remember two
1:43:23
things that would be interesting.
1:43:28
My mother was born in Gonzales during this time
1:43:39
which was, I’d say, ’48, ’50.
1:43:41
I helped sign up people to vote.
1:43:46
I remember that.
1:43:48
Many folks in Gonzales could not read, but we taught them how to read
1:43:58
their names, spell their names, sign their names, and get ready for voting.
1:44:05
My grandpa on my mother’s side was one of such persons.
1:44:11
I recall spending lots of time with him teaching him how to do
1:44:17
basic reading so he could vote.
1:44:20
Hm.
1:44:30
I remember being in Oregon during some parts of it when kids were
1:44:38
bussed to integrate schools.
1:44:42
I remember being a part of Highland School after the death of Martin Luther King.
1:44:55
We introduced a proclamation to make it, change the name
1:45:05
to Martin Luther King School.
1:45:09
We worked hard on that.
1:45:15
I remember living in, I remember lots of different things.
1:45:19
I remember living here in Salem when we were plagued with Aryan Nation
1:45:29
that came in and were doing several persons told me not to move here
1:45:38
because this was the home of Klansmen.
1:45:40
Tell us
1:45:43
a lot more about that.
1:45:46
Alright.
1:45:50
Some of it I read, some of it I was told.
1:45:54
When you’d come to Salem there were folks designated to give you a ticket and asked
1:46:03
you to get back on the bus, back on the train, go to the next town like Eugene.
1:46:14
That’s why you’d find more African Americans in those places
1:46:38
than Salem.
1:46:38
When was that happening?
1:46:39
Huh.
1:46:39
Let me think, because it was you could go to the capitol and see
1:46:40
that Oregon was not a place they had decided not to have Blacks, slave,
1:46:51
nor free in the capital city of Salem.
1:46:58
Hm.
1:47:04
Was that particularly in Salem at a time when in Portland they had Blacks
1:47:13
and Blacks had come in to work on the railroad and the boats in the shipyards?
1:47:22
In Portland, Portland,
1:47:32
Portland, Portland—I’m trying to specifically think of the name
1:47:41
of the town that was flooded.
1:47:47
Vanport.
1:47:48
Vanport.
1:47:50
Yes.
1:47:52
What I was wondering is,
1:47:56
was Salem, say, less welcoming to African Americans than Portland?
1:48:04
Was there a difference?
1:48:05
Yes.
1:48:07
So, yeah, that’s what, we don’t know very much about Salem.
1:48:11
Salem, Salem was the capital of Oregon.
1:48:17
They attempted to keep it.
1:48:20
Salem,
1:48:23
there was an attempt to keep it all White.
1:48:29
The way they did that was to meet folks at the various entry places and they knew,
1:48:39
like mister so-and-so lived on the corner.
1:48:43
There was one black family.
1:48:46
I think he was a shoe repair person.
1:48:53
Everybody knew who he was, where he lived.
1:48:55
There were
1:48:59
pictures in Mission Mill of this one little boy who attended school.
1:49:05
They did not have a separate but equal place for him to attend school, so you’ll
1:49:10
see a picture of him sitting with a group
1:49:18
of not Hispanic, all Caucasians,
1:49:24
because there was no school for him.
1:49:28
By the time you came to Salem, then there was how much difference?
1:49:34
I came to Salem.
1:49:36
First I went to Portland.
1:49:40
When I came to Salem, I would say that maybe there was 1%
1:49:49
of African Americans.
1:49:51
The story was told.
1:49:55
I did not get a ticket to move on to the next town.
1:50:00
I had attended a workshop at Seaside and someone at the school,
1:50:11
a certain school here, had problems.
1:50:16
The superintendent was in one of my workshops, and he said—I was saying
1:50:25
to the group of folks in my workshop that education is a commodity.
1:50:31
We have to sell it.
1:50:34
He said, I have a school that you could not
1:50:44
tell them that
1:50:48
education is a commodity.
1:50:51
They feel that whatever they want it’s okay.
1:50:57
So, you had schools that had lots of new curriculum, ideas, innovations, books,
1:51:07
because the community had lots of money.
1:51:11
Then you had people who had little money, poor curriculum, etc.,
1:51:21
because that’s all they could afford.
1:51:24
This particular school had people on one side of the street who were pig
1:51:31
farmers and on the other side you
1:51:38
had people, beautiful houses, $350,000, etc. It was a divide.
1:51:43
People didn’t get along very well.
1:51:43
So
1:51:51
the superintendent wondered if I could come and teach folks how to
1:51:58
get along in this particular school.
1:52:03
Jokingly, I said, I could teach crippled crabs how to walk with crutches.
1:52:10
That was a joke.
1:52:13
I said I’d come here.
1:52:18
It was 1958.
1:52:20
I was coming here to work for one year.
1:52:27
That school who didn’t have a racial problem, they had an economic problem.
1:52:35
My purpose was to come and help them get along, accept the instructions of the
1:52:44
board, and not try to control the school.
1:52:52
After one year,
1:52:57
I made some changes.
1:53:01
I’ve been here ever since.
1:53:03
What were the changes?
1:53:04
Changes were that the school would not be run by the community, but
1:53:12
the whole district made rules.
1:53:17
If we set them on a library and you could use the money allocated to you
1:53:23
to build a community, a playground, so that the community would have.
1:53:32
It took us a year, but what we did was put maps out and say,
1:53:38
what would you like to have?
1:53:40
How would you like your school to look?
1:53:43
We had fundraisers, and only one thing I didn’t approve of.
1:53:49
Somebody suggested that the fundraiser would be to have the
1:53:49
principal as part of a dunk, I said
1:54:03
no way [laughs]
1:54:06
. That was not a good idea.
1:54:12
I could understand that.
1:54:13
Which it was some kind of apparatus where the person sat on a board or
1:54:19
something and you could hit a certain.
1:54:24
Would they be dunked in the water?
1:54:25
They’d be dunked in the water.
1:54:27
That was not my idea of fun.
1:54:31
So, I got the custodian to do that for me.
1:54:35
Instead, I washed cars.
1:54:38
You could get your car washed by the principal [laughs]
1:54:43
for such and such an amount.
1:54:45
So, the theory was getting the people of two different economic
1:54:49
groups doing things together.
1:54:51
Exactly.
1:54:52
Those pig farmers cooked their heads off and they were selling pies.
1:55:03
One guy had,
1:55:09
oh, I forgot about—this guy was raising fighting cocks.
1:55:17
You weren’t supposed to raise those.
1:55:18
It was illegal.
1:55:20
So, they made chicken soup,
1:55:25
and they sold bowls.
1:55:26
He killed his fighting cocks and they made chicken soup.
1:55:34
That
1:55:38
was good.
1:55:38
That raised money.
1:55:40
Those kinds of things happened but it brought groups together,
1:55:45
working together, and raising money
1:55:51
together.
1:55:52
it worked for a while.
1:55:55
Is there any more things that you were doing in the Civil Rights Movement?
1:56:01
Civil Rights Movement.
1:56:03
I did work with signing people up so
1:56:06
that they could vote.
1:56:14
That was one of the big things I remember.
1:56:15
Hm.
1:56:16
Getting votes.
1:56:19
That
1:56:21
was the biggest thing.
1:56:21
I was not a part of any lines where you marched.
1:56:25
I did see Martin Luther King who came to speak to the churches and tell
1:56:35
us about some of these movements, but all the places I stayed.
1:56:42
I had left New Orleans, so I was not a part of that movement.
1:56:49
My biggest contribution was getting folks to vote.
1:56:55
You mentioned for the work for the NAACP.
1:56:59
What have you been doing with them?
1:57:03
Now I’m not doing hardly anything for anyone.
1:57:06
I’m too old.
1:57:07
But before?
1:57:10
I carried my same skill—getting folks signed up.
1:57:17
Getting money into organizations.
1:57:18
Fundraisers.
1:57:18
Contributed things for auctions.
1:57:18
From the time you arrived in Oregon to now, do
1:57:21
you think that there
1:57:38
have been any positive changes in race relations?
1:57:43
Negative changes?
1:57:45
How would you—what’s your vision?
1:57:49
It’s not my vision.
1:57:50
Your perception?
1:57:51
My perception, almost miniscule.
1:57:55
Yes.
1:57:56
It kind of depends on...
1:58:04
hmm.
1:58:06
Let me tell you the Epistle of Gerry.
1:58:07
What I see is that there’s so many ways to maintain
1:58:16
segregation, okay?
1:58:21
If I decide that I’m going to change the housing situation.
1:58:29
I want
1:58:33
Portland, take Portland, to be White, a White area, White
1:58:44
neighborhood around 40th where my mother used to live.
1:58:47
So what did they do?
1:58:49
They put commercial stores all on Martin Luther King, all on
1:59:00
Alberta.
1:59:00
What can you do, because the Blacks who lived in those
1:59:06
areas had to go somewhere else.
1:59:09
Years and years ago, they went to the place that got
1:59:15
flooded.
1:59:16
Now,
1:59:19
they’re moving out of the Alberta back to
1:59:27
the St. John areas.
1:59:31
Those areas
1:59:34
that you could end up with more ghettos.
1:59:42
I don’t know.
1:59:43
It seems that integration seems to be so much based on economics
1:59:53
until if you’ve got money, you can integrate my neighborhood.
1:59:57
You may
2:00:02
not have the voting rights.
2:00:05
You may not have the economic power, but you can live here.
2:00:15
Maybe a poor person to
2:00:21
ask.
2:00:21
But that’s what I’ve observed.
2:00:22
I have observed if you—where’s the big money?
2:00:26
It’s in sports now.
2:00:31
Let’s think about that.
2:00:33
If all of
2:00:42
our billionaires, millionaires are not academic, are not part of academia.
2:00:46
They’re not at University of Oregon, what kind of kids are they
2:00:53
going to produce?
2:00:53
Little kids with fast running legs and big hands?
2:00:57
[Laughs] to manage basketballs?
2:01:02
Big shoulders for football?
2:01:05
What’s going to happen to the brainiacs that we need?
2:01:09
The scientists?
2:01:11
The mathematicians?
2:01:12
I have no answer.
2:01:15
I’m glad that death will take me away soon, you know?
2:01:21
Because
2:01:28
I’m not seeing that somebody’s coming forth that’s going to
2:01:35
be the drum major of academics.
2:01:40
I worry about that.
2:01:44
I don’t know.
2:01:46
I’m sad.
2:01:48
I’m sad for you younger persons, because there’s so many ways to keep
2:01:54
you out of academia, to keep you out of the money making epsilon to keep
2:02:07
from buying.
2:02:09
You can buy the big houses, but who’s going to clean them?
2:02:14
Who’s
2:02:16
going to... I don’t know.
2:02:19
I worry about
2:02:23
my nation.
2:02:24
I worry about somebody who’s not going to have this insight, the power,
2:02:34
the power, the power is not shared.
2:02:43
What’s happening to the young people?
2:02:48
They’re not seeing the need.
2:02:50
In my day, be a part of green beret, red beret, fight to get your name up there.
2:03:01
We’re not having that group.
2:03:04
I don’t know.
2:03:08
I wish
2:03:11
I could tell you that
2:03:15
you’ve got to get education as mantle, as the top thing, as
2:03:25
what we should all aspire for.
2:03:28
With education comes power.
2:03:33
I think.
2:03:36
I agree.
2:03:36
[Laughs]
