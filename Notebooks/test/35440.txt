This is an interview with Joy Pruitt on June 28,
00:09
2018.
00:10
Hi, Joy, we’ve been having a really nice conversation before starting
00:14
the interview, and I was holding back from starting to ask you about your
00:20
life while we were just chatting.
00:23
Now we can talk more about more interesting things
00:27
than you’ve already told me.
00:30
So, the idea of the interview is we want to get a whole history of your life
00:37
and how you got to where you are now.
00:42
We focus on different aspects of your life, parts that, according to some
00:48
of the topics that we’re interested in and just let it flow and start.
00:53
Let’s just start from
00:58
where you were born and a little bit about your childhood and how you got to Oregon.
01:07
I was born in Portland, Oregon.
01:09
That’s how I got here.
01:12
I lived on northeast Shaver Street, and my family and I were in an
01:18
environment of Russian and German.
01:21
As far as Black Americans, there were maybe about 5 in a total of 25 blocks.
01:31
We didn’t have a whole lot of Blacks living with us, although they are still
01:35
family friends after all these years.
01:40
Went to elementary school, Sabin, where I was the only Black in my class.
01:47
My sisters experienced the same thing.
01:50
Of course, we, unfortunately, were subjected to a lot of negative
01:57
responses, not only from the students but from the teachers.
02:01
One of my teachers liked me very well and had me stay after school and help her.
02:07
Then one day I walked in and she said, oh, here comes my cute little darkie.
02:12
I went home and told my mother that.
02:14
I didn’t get to go back to school in her class after school.
02:19
Those are the kinds of experiences that we had when you were the only Black,
02:24
either in your class, or in the schools.
02:27
My family and Tillman family and the Hardy family were the only
02:34
families at Sabin at the time.
02:37
When you, when your teacher said that and you went home and told your
02:41
mother, what did your mother do?
02:44
What happened specifically?
02:46
My mother talked to me, because at that time all the conversation in the world
02:51
would not have changed the teacher, because that was the environment.
02:55
She talked to me, and she said you just don’t go after school anymore
03:00
and don’t make a big issue of it because we don’t have a support system.
03:03
She was right.
03:05
Those were the kinds of things that we were taught, just handle it quietly.
03:12
Think about what your goal is, and rise about it.
03:15
That’s all we could do.
03:17
What was your relation with the other children?
03:22
Actually, it was so prejudiced at that time that when the kids would
03:28
have birthday parties, they would send invitations to all the kids but me.
03:35
My sisters experienced the same thing.
03:38
The teachers were perfectly oblivious of that.
03:41
They allowed the children to hand the invitations out in class.
03:46
Well, you know how that made you feel.
03:48
Again, Mother said, don’t let that bother you.
03:51
Think about your goal.
03:53
Of course, the goal that my parents taught is you are going to go to college and get
03:56
an education so you can rise above this.
04:00
That’s what we did.
04:02
We got along with the kids, but it was on a superficial level in grade school.
04:14
Then, after grade school, was junior high, or what?
04:20
No.
04:21
In those days [laughs] , the early days, it was kindergarten to
04:25
eighth grade in the same school.
04:27
Oh, okay.
04:27
That’s how it was.
04:29
Then they switched boundaries, so then we went to Sabin until I was in third grade,
04:35
and then I went to Highland, which is down Martin Luther King School, I went there
04:39
until I graduated to go to Jefferson.
04:42
What was that like there?
04:44
Just as bad, sometimes worse.
04:48
You know, it was more the teachers than the students, but they picked it up.
04:52
The kids picked it up from their parents, and then they
04:55
picked it up from the teachers.
04:57
An example, I had a teacher, her name was Mrs. Cowie.
05:01
She taught history, and in those days they had you read from the book, so the teacher
05:08
would say, Susie it’s your turn to read.
05:10
Sally, it’s your turn to read.
05:13
Every time she called me, in the paragraph it had to have
05:16
pickaninny, or slavery, or nigger.
05:20
Every time.
05:22
See, that was done on purpose.
05:25
Of course, you know, kids would look and giggle and laugh.
05:27
It really it made you feel badly.
05:30
But, again, I could hear my mother in the background say, don’t let that bother you.
05:35
You have a better goal in life.
05:38
That’s hard to handle sometimes.
05:42
In my class there was one other Gladys Baker, a Black person.
05:46
She’s a very quiet person.
05:49
We just sort of looked at each other.
05:50
We knew we couldn’t do anything about it.
05:52
This came to the teachers, principal, and the students.
05:57
So, you learned to adjust to it.
06:00
Tell a bit more about how you did learn to adjust to it.
06:03
It just seems—
06:05
We had a very, very strong family relationship.
06:09
Very strong.
06:10
There are four girls, and my mother and my father.
06:14
Most kids grow up, you always say momma and daddy.
06:17
My folks always say education.
06:20
That was the prime interest, and they told us, they said, if you get an education
06:25
you won’t have to go through all this.
06:27
This was, we were brainwashed to believe that.
06:31
When we graduated high school, we knew right then and there we
06:34
were going to go on to college.
06:35
We had no other alternative.
06:37
It was planned that way.
06:40
That kind of information was very useful, especially for me, when I went
06:45
to Linfield College, because when I went to Linfield, which is in McMinnville,
06:51
Oregon, the model there was the sun will never set on a darkie here.
06:57
That was a model in McMinnville.
07:00
I was the only Black in the whole town, let alone the college.
07:06
So, I knew what I was going to expect.
07:09
In all that teaching that our folks did really helped.
07:14
We learned to ignore some of the things that happened.
07:17
We focused on something else.
07:19
It wasn’t easy, but it paid off in the long run.
07:23
Again, because we had no support system.
07:26
When I went to Linfield, my freshman year, I finally got a support system.
07:31
That was the Urban League of Portland.
07:35
Edwin C. Berry was the executive secretary, and he was in my corner
07:40
all the way through college.
07:42
Sometimes it was so unbearable that first year, that all I could do
07:47
to was just cry and I’d call him.
07:49
He’d say, okay, it’s time to come home and we’ll have lunch and you tell me about it.
07:54
He was such a support system.
07:56
My father and mother were both support systems, but it was on a different
08:00
level, a motherly kind and a family.
08:04
This was an educated man who had experienced what I was experiencing
08:09
and was able to rise above it.
08:11
He gave me some good clues.
08:13
He said, just keep busy.
08:17
Two questions here to follow—one is how was it that you chose
08:21
to go to Linfield College?
08:24
[Laughs] Everybody asks me that, knowing what the model was.
08:28
My folks told us that we were going to go to college, all four of us,
08:32
and we were excited until they said but it has to be in Oregon.
08:37
So, you know don’t have much, in those days you didn’t have much to choose from.
08:43
There was Portland State, Lewis & Clark, Linfield College, and the teacher’s
08:51
college in, oh I can’t remember the name of the teachers college now.
08:57
I can’t remember it.
08:59
[Break in recording]
08:59
. We were talking about why you went to Linfield College.
09:03
Mm-hmm, and the reason why I went to Linfield is because my folks said we all
09:08
had to go to college, but they failed to tell us that we had to do it in
09:12
Oregon, where you know there are just so many colleges in Oregon at that time.
09:17
So, I went to Linfield.
09:20
My sister went to Lewis & Clark.
09:23
The other went to Monmouth and one went to Portland State.
09:27
We decided we wanted to go to all four different colleges.
09:32
How come, how did you find?
09:37
How did I find Linfield?
09:39
Right, I mean that’s—
09:40
I’ll tell you the truth—you know, I’ve always loved music.
09:43
Linfield had an outstanding choir.
09:47
I thought, I’ll go to Linfield and sing in the choir, not realizing you
09:52
had to have a background in music and all I was singing was from the ear.
09:57
When they handed me a piece of paper and told me to read
09:59
the notes I was totally lost.
10:02
I never got in the choir.
10:06
That’s one reason why I went to Linfield.
10:09
After I got there, I stayed.
10:12
What were some of the other reasons?
10:14
It was a good school, a good academic school.
10:19
It had a good educational program, which I definitely was interested
10:24
in, because I wanted to be a teacher.
10:28
I knew I could live on campus.
10:31
I just figured that the school would be much better than a city.
10:34
I don’t know why I thought that.
10:37
It was better, but I still had some experiences that I would
10:40
have liked to have forgotten.
10:44
Do you want to remember them some of them at the moment for us?
10:47
Not really.
10:48
But I’ll share them anyway [laughs] . When I first entered Linfield,
10:55
I went into the office like everyone else, and Dean Anderson, she was the dean, would
11:01
say John, Julie this is your partner.
11:06
She went on telling everybody their partner for their room, for roommates.
11:11
They got to me: this is your room.
11:14
I was the only one out of the whole freshman class that had a room by myself.
11:19
She made the assumption that no one wanted to room with me.
11:24
Of course, I was the only Black on campus, but that still was an assumption.
11:30
I just went, I took the room.
11:32
Then in the long run, you know, it paid off.
11:35
Sometimes, sometimes you can almost appreciate segregation, because I
11:41
hadn’t been in that room I would say 3 months and I had several of the girls
11:46
come to me and say how much extra do you have to pay for a single room?
11:50
I can’t stand my roommate.
11:52
It’d tickle me because they thought I was privileged because I had a single room.
11:56
I never told them it was out of segregation.
12:00
The next year, I got a roommate.
12:03
She wanted to room with me badly.
12:04
A lot of them fell apart, couldn’t get along with their roommates, and
12:08
I did realize how lucky I really was.
12:11
Tell me, then, you did have a roommate.
12:13
So, some of your social relations with the students,
12:19
how were they?
12:20
Tell me about that.
12:20
Actually, you know actually when—it’s amazing, and everyone knows this.
12:26
Segregation, prejudice comes, is a taught thing.
12:31
It’s taught from the parents and the environment.
12:33
When these kids had left their home and their environment,
12:37
they didn’t see any difference.
12:39
They really didn’t.
12:40
It didn’t take me long to acquire real close friends.
12:44
One of my closest friends, my roommate, here name was Elizabeth, and she came
12:50
from Missoula, Montana, had never seen a Black person in her life.
12:56
We just hit it off right away.
12:59
Then, she only lasted in my room for just one year because she fell in love.
13:05
A lot of them went to school at that time just to get husbands,
13:09
majority of the women did.
13:11
They even mentioned it.
13:12
Anyway, she fell in love with Raul Worth, and they own a
13:17
lumber company in McMinnville.
13:20
So, she said she wanted me to be her maid of honor.
13:24
I said, fine.
13:25
She said, my mom’s coming next week and she’ll get a chance to meet you.
13:29
I said, fine.
13:29
I never thought anything about it.
13:31
Her mother arrived, and she said, Mom, this is my roommate Joy.
13:37
She looked at me, and she said you never told me that you had
13:41
a roommate that was colored!
13:44
She looked at her, and she said, Mom, it didn’t make any difference.
13:49
Well, it does to me!
13:51
She said, she is not going to be in your wedding, and if she’s going to
13:55
be in your wedding, I won’t be there.
13:58
it went on like that.
13:59
She had BJ in tears.
14:04
Then BJ told Raul and the said, oh, that’s alright.
14:08
He said, we’ll get married here.
14:10
Because they were going to go back to Missoula.
14:12
We’ll get married here.
14:14
We went, and then that prejudice really came out.
14:17
Went to the Baptist that sponsored Linfield College.
14:21
He told me, no way.
14:23
He could not have me in that wedding.
14:26
We went to an Episcopal church, told me the same thing.
14:31
Went to a Catholic church, and he said, well you couldn’t go behind the, I don’t
14:37
know what the gate is or something.
14:38
I don’t know what.
14:39
It didn’t make sense.
14:40
To make a long story short—none of the churches would accept me.
14:46
So, BJ said, well, I am not going to get married here.
14:51
I’ll go to Missoula.
14:52
I said, well, that’s going to be worse.
14:55
I told her, go ahead.
14:56
She cried.
14:56
I said, go ahead and get married.
14:57
You’re only going to get married once, supposedly.
15:00
I said, you want your mother there.
15:03
It doesn’t make any difference to me.
15:05
Not only that, I don’t have any money to go to Missoula anyway,
15:08
because I was working day and night.
15:10
That’s what happened.
15:11
She said, I’ll give you one promise.
15:14
She said, when I get married and have my children, I will teach them far
15:20
different than what my parents taught me.
15:22
She did exactly what she said.
15:24
There were five children.
15:26
They lived in California.
15:27
She joined the Urban League.
15:29
She joined the NAACP, and she regularly went to meetings.
15:34
She did do some good down there.
15:37
It paid off in the long run.
15:38
Yeah.
15:40
Yeah.
15:41
You were telling about the person that was in the Urban League
15:44
that gave you a lot of support.
15:46
Edwin C. Berry.
15:48
Tell us a little bit about the Urban League and how it was functioning
15:52
in McMinnville and about that.
15:53
Well,
15:56
the Urban League was an organization that tried to implement integration
16:03
in every level—schools, organizations, political aspect, all of it.
16:12
Edwin C. Berry was an articulate person, and people would listen to him.
16:18
He was such an asset to me.
16:21
He stuck with me the whole, all four years.
16:23
Anytime something got a little unbearable, and I’d call him.
16:27
He’d always said, okay, it’s time for lunch.
16:30
I’d sit, and I’d tell him, and he’d listen.
16:33
He never let me give in.
16:34
You can’t give in now.
16:37
He was the kind of support, you know, that you need all through life
16:41
if you have problems that you’re by yourself and you can’t handle.
16:45
My parents were excellent, too, but Edwin C. Berry was on a different educational
16:51
level that could understand all that.
16:55
He must have been White, because
17:00
there weren’t any African Americans in McMinnville.
17:01
Oh, no.
17:01
I’d come to Portland.
17:02
He was the executive secretary of the Urban League of Portland.
17:05
Yeah that’s what I thought.
17:07
That’s why I was a little confused.
17:08
I got to know him very well because I always had a job during the summer.
17:12
Every time summertime came he said, you come and work at the Urban League.
17:17
He supported me all the way.
17:19
He was an outstanding person.
17:21
You were saying while you were going through college you were working?
17:25
Oh, I had to.
17:25
I think I went to college, I think with either 5 or 10 cents [laughs]
17:30
. What kind of jobs did you have while you were studying?
17:33
Everything you could think of.
17:34
In fact, that’s the only time I felt that the dean was really on my side.
17:38
I told her, I needed to work.
17:41
I said, I want to work because my goal is to finish college.
17:45
She said, well, okay.
17:47
She said, these are a couple of jobs you can get—cafeteria.
17:51
I worked in the cafeteria.
17:54
I passed out clean sheets in dorms.
17:58
I worked out in the yard in the garden.
18:01
Anything you named, I did.
18:03
That was an asset for me, and I didn’t realize it at the time
18:07
because it gave me a chance to really learn, to know everybody.
18:11
They’d see me out there and they’d come, hi Joy.
18:13
We’d sit and talk and have a good time.
18:16
It was very helpful.
18:18
It was.
18:19
That’s the way I got through college.
18:22
That’s right.
18:22
It sounds to me that once you were there, aside from—
18:26
All the...
18:27
—the environment within the town, that within the...
18:32
Institution itself.
18:33
...institution and the teachers and the students...
18:36
It was better.
18:36
It was better.
18:38
Yeah, but there was still, there was still something over your head, because we had
18:42
a tea for all the freshman and the tea was about the third month that we were there.
18:47
They told us to go down to town, in McMinnville.
18:52
It was called the Portland Hotel.
18:54
I believe that’s the name of it.
18:55
Oregon Hotel.
18:56
Sign up for your parents, the mothers to stay there, and
19:02
be sure to get there in time so your mother can come.
19:06
I stood in line, like everybody else, about 15, 20 minutes before.
19:10
It came up to me, and I said I’d like to make a reservation for my mother.
19:14
He said, oh, no.
19:16
we can’t have her stay here.
19:18
I was shocked, because you know, the atmosphere was as if it was open.
19:23
They’re beginning to accept me.
19:24
But, not in the town.
19:27
I went back to the dean, thinking the dean was going to be on my
19:30
side, told her what happened.
19:33
She said, your mother can stay in the dorm with you, then.
19:39
I said to myself, I’m not going to have my mother, the only mother
19:43
stay in the dorm with me because they’re segregating against her.
19:48
I didn’t never invited her.
19:49
I decided I was going to have my mother humiliated.
19:52
You know what dorms are like: screaming, and noisy, and yelling.
19:56
I thought, no.
19:57
My mother, to this day, never knew that we had a tea.
20:02
Instead, I worked.
20:04
I took everybody’s job that couldn’t be there, made a lot of money that weekend,
20:08
which I needed, and I just let that go.
20:11
In a sense, then, you protected your mother.
20:14
Oh yeah.
20:16
But you know that town was so prejudiced.
20:19
They had an oriental restaurant there, a Chinese restaurant, and the
20:24
people couldn’t live in McMinnville.
20:26
They lived in Newberg.
20:28
The Chinese people had to go back and forth every day, but everybody in
20:32
McMinnville ate at their restaurant, but they wouldn’t allow them to live there.
20:38
Let’s change the subject a little bit, but getting more in your background.
20:41
Tell us a little more about your parents.
20:45
Well, my mother was a school teacher in St. Louis, Missouri.
20:50
My father, my father was born in Mississippi but he wouldn’t tell us.
20:56
Mother told us about it.
20:58
He had experienced some Ku Klux Klan episodes, and as a result of it,
21:07
he ran away from home, when to St. Louis where he knew relatives were.
21:11
He was 16.
21:13
They said, you can’t live here.
21:15
You’ve got to go back and finish school.
21:17
His own father was a college graduate, which was most unusual in those days.
21:23
His father wanted to be an architect.
21:27
He finished college, but nobody in Mississippi would let him
21:30
take the, pass the board.
21:34
He didn’t have any money to go outside of Mississippi, and there
21:38
weren’t too many places outside of Mississippi you could go.
21:41
That was his father.
21:43
When he saw how his father was treated, he ended up being a carpenter, and
21:47
he built a school in Mississippi.
21:51
When he realized what his father was going through, he wasn’t too encouraged to go
21:56
back to Mississippi to finish high school.
21:58
He went back.
21:59
He stayed less than a year, and he ran away again.
22:03
This time, he knew what he needed to do.
22:05
He knew he needed to work.
22:07
So, he went back to St. Louis, lied about his age, and
22:12
you’ve heard of Gandy dancers?
22:14
The people who used to put nails in the railroad tracks?
22:19
He lied about his age and he got a job there.
22:22
He stayed.
22:23
He was an avid reader, because his father was a college graduate.
22:26
He read all the time.
22:28
He was a very articulate and very smart man, but he refused to go
22:32
back to school and go through what his father had gone through.
22:37
So, he stayed in St. Louis.
22:39
He worked.
22:40
He saved his money.
22:41
He met my mother.
22:42
They started dating.
22:43
It was interesting, because when they decided to get married,
22:47
my mother was 20 at the time.
22:53
In those days, you couldn’t be married and still teach.
22:56
My mother was teaching.
22:58
They got married.
22:59
My mother went back and lived with her father, and my dad kept working.
23:03
By then, he was on the railroad.
23:05
He said to her, we’ll live this kind of life for one year, and then we’ll
23:12
go and leave St. Louis and find someplace where we can have a family
23:16
and they will get a good education.
23:18
He came to Portland first, and then he went to Los Angeles.
23:22
He chose Portland.
23:24
That’s how, and then all of us were born here in Portland.
23:29
When he came to Portland, was he working on the train then?
23:35
Yes.
23:36
By then, what kind of job on the trains did he have?
23:39
He was a waiter then.
23:40
So, he became a waiter.
23:42
Mm-hmm.
23:45
Then my mother came out with him.
23:47
Of course, again, they wouldn’t hire her.
23:49
She was teaching back in St. Louis.
23:51
Came to Portland, and wouldn’t hire her.
23:54
She was a ahead of her—as they told her, she was ahead of her time.
23:58
My dad wasn’t too disappointed in that because he would rather have her home.
24:03
By then they were having children, four girls.
24:07
He would rather have her home raising us and instill an education in us.
24:13
That’s the way it worked.
24:14
How did she feel about that?
24:16
She felt, well, she couldn’t get a job here anyway, so... and she wanted
24:20
children, so it worked fine for her.
24:25
Then, so, you went into teaching.
24:28
Mm-hmm.
24:29
What drove you to go into teaching?
24:32
I think my mother.
24:33
She was a good teacher, and she was a good example.
24:35
She was such a better example than all the teachers I had, because so
24:38
many of them were so prejudiced.
24:41
But, you know, I learned from their prejudiced.
24:43
I learned that the way that they treated me and the way some of those
24:48
teachers treated other children, I decide if I’m going to be a teacher,
24:51
I’m not going to be that way.
24:53
I learned from what not to do.
24:56
I was really excited, and when I did my student teaching, in McMinnville, which
25:01
was sort of scary at first, because I was still the only Black in the city.
25:07
I thought, oh, what’s going to happen when I do my student teaching in these schools?
25:11
But they chose the right teacher for me.
25:15
She had those kids so well-prepared, it was unbelievable.
25:19
When I walked in the class, she said, this is Mrs.—I was Brock
25:22
then, this is Mrs. Brock, and she will do her student teaching here.
25:27
Then there’s a silence, and then they said, hello Mrs. Brock.
25:32
Which, shocked me to no end.
25:33
I really enjoyed the class.
25:35
They were well-disciplined.
25:37
When I graduated, she wrote me a beautiful resume.
25:41
I thought, well, I’ve been successful here.
25:45
I think I’ll try a small town in Oregon and teach.
25:49
I tried.
25:50
That was the year that they passed the bill that you did not need to
25:54
send your picture with an application.
25:57
I didn’t send my picture.
25:59
I didn’t have to.
26:01
They had no idea I was a Black person.
26:03
Every time I got a phone call or they want to interview me, they
26:07
were so excited until they saw me.
26:10
I think I was interviewed maybe about 9 or 10 times.
26:16
Now, it got to be 3 days before school opened, and I tried in Gladstone,
26:23
just through correspondence.
26:25
The man talked to me on the phone, he said, oh.
26:28
We’re just looking—you’re exactly what we’re looking for.
26:32
You’ve got the kind of resume.
26:33
You’ve been active in your school.
26:35
He went on and on.
26:36
He said, I’m going to be out of town for a day or two, he said.
26:39
But you come two days before school, before the teachers come.
26:44
I’ll tell you what room you’ll be in and you’re taking the place
26:50
of a teacher that’s pregnant.
26:51
She just let me know that she’s going to retire.
26:54
I said, fine.
26:55
I went to Gladstone the day he told me.
26:59
Nobody was there except him.
27:02
I was in the hall, but I didn’t see anyone.
27:04
So, I called, I said, hello?
27:06
He said, oh, I’ll be right there with you.
27:08
I stood in the hall.
27:10
He walked out in the hall.
27:12
He looked at me, he said, may I help you?
27:16
I said, yes.
27:17
I said, I’m Mrs. Brock.
27:19
You know what he said?
27:20
Are you sure?
27:23
That’s exactly what he said.
27:25
I know what he was implementing.
27:27
He was implementing that, number one, of course I’ve been told too
27:31
many times, which is ridiculous, you didn’t sound like a Black person.
27:36
He said, I am so sorry, he
27:42
said, but she decided not to quit.
27:45
Now, how can you be not pregnant overnight?
27:48
[Laughs] . Oh, that killed me.
27:51
I’ll never—that was one of the worst days of my life, because
27:55
that was my last chance, you know?
27:56
Schools were going to open up in 2 days.
27:59
Again, I called Edwin Berry and he said, come on over.
28:03
So, I told him what I’d gone through, and he asked me how the interviews went, etc.
28:08
He said, why didn’t you try Portland.
28:10
I said, well, I did, but I didn’t hear from them because my sister,
28:14
by then, was older, but she was teaching in Portland, doing a good.
28:18
She teaches on the west side.
28:19
At that time, they wouldn’t hire any Blacks on the west side unless
28:22
they thought you were outstanding.
28:24
She was the only one.
28:25
Her name was Ruby.
28:27
I said, well, this doesn’t make sense.
28:29
He said, let me double check.
28:31
He called Tom McCall.
28:33
Tom McCall and he were very good friends, and the next day he called me.
28:38
He said, okay, come and have lunch with me.
28:41
I went down, and he said, we have discovered that Portland Public School
28:45
have an un-written, I can’t call it a law, but un-written statement that
28:53
they would only hire 1 to 2, at the time negroes, negroes a year, and
29:01
the two have already been hired.
29:04
I said, I looked at him, I said, well, that means it’s something we could fight.
29:09
He said, no, you know why we can’t fight it?
29:11
Because it’s an unwritten law.
29:13
To get that proof, he said, that’s going to be the problem.
29:18
I said, oh, I said, what am I going to do?
29:20
I said, school’s going to start now.
29:22
He said, Tom said, and I agree, you go down to Portland Public Schools,
29:27
and you sign up for substituting.
29:29
He said, and you do as good a job substituting as you did in McMinnville.
29:34
I guarantee by the end of the year you’re going to get calls from 3 or 4 principals.
29:41
I couldn’t get excited about that, but I did what he told me to do.
29:45
He was absolutely right.
29:47
By the end of the year, I got 4 calls from principals who wanted me.
29:51
Then I got to thinking, 3 of the principals were from white Schools.
29:57
One was an integrated school, which was Boyce at the time.
30:00
Boyce Alley.
30:01
So, I chose Boyce.
30:03
I really loved it.
30:05
I had a good integrated group at that time.
30:09
So, I taught at Boyce for a year, and then I got married.
30:16
Then had to go through the same thing again in Las Vegas.
30:21
My husband’s in the Air Force.
30:23
We were stationed at Nellis Air Base, they had a third grade
30:27
opening right on Nellis Air Base.
30:29
I was so excited, and I was told.
30:32
I went to the commander in chief, and he said well, we have nothing
30:38
to do with hiring, even though it’s on the Air Base grounds.
30:41
It is run by Las Vegas School System.
30:45
You have to go to Las Vegas itself.
30:47
I said, okay, I had no problem.
30:49
Third grade, it was walking distance from where I lived.
30:52
I went down, I told the men that there was an opening, and I was
30:56
interested [the superintendent].
30:58
I was interested in being hired.
30:59
He looked at me and said, you’re ahead of your time.
31:03
We can’t hire you now.
31:05
But we can hire you for the Black school on the west side.
31:11
I said, but I’m used to working in an integrated setting.
31:14
He said, well, I’ve told you what’s going to happen.
31:17
He said, if you want to teach, you’ll go to the west side.
31:19
He was so mean.
31:21
He wasn’t even like a superintendent.
31:22
He
31:25
said, do you want the job or not?
31:27
I said, well, I’m going to go back and talk with my husband.
31:29
I went back and I talked with him.
31:32
The adjutant general there said, you’ve got to remember he is a Mormon.
31:39
He’s not going to change his attitude at all, but if you want teach that’s
31:45
going to be your best deal, because we have nothing to do with the hiring.
31:50
I did.
31:52
Found out where west side was—25 miles from where I was, Nellis Air Base.
31:58
Las Vegas was, most of the time, 95-105 degrees, and I’m leaving Oregon.
32:07
I had to wear gloves when I drove there.
32:10
The steering wheel was so hot.
32:13
We were on the main highway, and every time I came home from west side school,
32:18
I was stopped by a policeman because they’re always looking for gangsters.
32:22
In those days, I guess gangsters are coming and going to Las Vegas.
32:25
I didn’t know anything about it.
32:26
They were looking to see if somebody was hiding in the card.
32:29
I wasn’t the only one.
32:31
They stopped every time you turn around.
32:33
But to sit in a car that long in 100 degrees, I thought I was going to die.
32:39
Anyway, took the class, third grade class and the ages were from 8 to 14.
32:47
Totally segregated except one White child in the class, which was just
32:52
reverse from what I came from.
32:55
I couldn’t believe it, 8-14.
32:59
The teachers, oh, I couldn’t believe them.
33:01
They came with their hair in pin curls.
33:04
Some of them had the anklets on.
33:05
They didn’t dress anything like we did here in Portland.
33:08
You had to have stockings and heels and really—and they
33:11
judged you on how you dressed in
33:16
Portland.
33:16
There was only one other teacher, and it was a Black teacher.
33:20
It was
33:25
Marquetta—you know, the Globe
33:30
Trotters.
33:30
What was his name?
33:33
Anyway, his wife.
33:34
It’ll come to me.
33:34
It was his wife.
33:36
She was the only Black there.
33:38
I said to her, how do you stand it?
33:40
Why are they coming this way?
33:41
She said, because it’s so hot in Las Vegas that they get an hour and a half lunch.
33:48
We got about 15 minutes in Portland.
33:51
She said, and then they change clothes and they go to the strip and they
33:57
gamble during that hour and a half.
33:59
Then they come back.
34:00
She said, we can’t go because they discriminate against us.
34:04
So, she and I stayed and did our lesson plans.
34:06
The thing that really bothered me that first month I was there, the teachers
34:11
were screaming and yelling at those kids like you wouldn’t believe, like
34:14
they were animals, except Marcia.
34:17
She didn’t, and so I said to her--where do you get your training?
34:23
She said Oklahoma.
34:24
We didn’t treat kids like that.
34:26
She said, but they don’t care here in Las Vegas.
34:28
I said, let’s show them.
34:30
Not only that, discipline was rubber hoses.
34:34
They would beat those kids with rubber hoses.
34:37
I made the mistake by going down to the superintendent again and
34:41
telling him, you know they’re beating those kids with rubber hoses.
34:44
He said, well, they have to have discipline.
34:46
He could have cared less.
34:47
To make a long story short, I said to Marquetta, you know what I’m going to do?
34:53
I said, since you and I are here for an hour and a half for lunch, and everybody’s
34:57
gone but you and I, we are going to go in those rooms and steal those rubber hoses.
35:02
She fell down laughing.
35:03
She was such a good person.
35:04
She said, what are you going to do with them?
35:06
I said, I will put them in the trunk of my car, and I will take them out to Nellis
35:10
Air Base and I said I’ll dumb them out in the--they had big box turtles this big,
35:14
I said they can play along with them.
35:17
She said, okay, I’ll do it with you.
35:18
So, I did.
35:19
Took them out and did exactly what I said.
35:21
You know, no one said a word about those rubber hoses.
35:25
Nobody mentioned it at all.
35:27
I told her, we have to do next thing is to teach and let them see the kids
35:32
can be taught without yelling at them.
35:35
I said, we’ll do that by keeping our door open and I told my students,
35:39
I said, you read 15 minutes and then we’ll go out for 10.
35:44
Come back do math 15, and go out for 10.
35:48
I set that kind of program to get them in the habit of disciplining and
35:52
reading, because I knew the interest span was just like that, you know.
35:57
It worked.
35:58
Marquetta did the same thing, and we kept our doors open.
36:02
I never heard any complaints about those rubber hoses.
36:06
I never heard anything from those teachers, but they
36:09
sure were quiet and watching.
36:11
I felt real good that year, and I did
36:15
do this.
36:16
I know most kids like sports, most of them do.
36:21
This big 14-year-old was twice as tall as I was.
36:24
I could tell he was a gang leader of the kids.
36:27
I thought, I get him on my side I won’t have any problems.
36:30
I told them that in the 15 we’d play prism ball.
36:33
Well, I’ve always been good at sports.
36:35
Love sports.
36:37
I told him, you read, don’t take your eyes off the paper and in
36:43
15 minutes I’ll keep my promise.
36:45
Well, of course the first 15 minutes, the kids were doing like [looks around the
36:48
room] watching me all around the room.
36:51
15 minutes went by.
36:52
I said, okay it’s up now.
36:54
They said, oh do we go outside and play prism ball?
36:56
I said, no.
36:57
they looked at me.
36:58
I said, just a minute.
36:59
I’ll tell you why.
37:01
I walked around the room, some of you were following me with your eyes.
37:06
I said, which means you weren’t reading.
37:08
I told you if you came up on a word that you didn’t understand just raise your
37:13
hand quietly and I’ll come and help you.
37:15
I said, I didn’t see any hands raised.
37:19
They couldn’t complain, because I told them, and now
37:21
I’ll give you another chance.
37:23
Oh, they were relieved.
37:23
The second time more of them were reading.
37:26
Not all of them, but enough.
37:28
Then, I told them we’re playing prism ball.
37:30
I want to be the leader.
37:31
I said, you don’t yell.
37:33
I’m going to be one of the captains, and I’ll choose another captain.
37:37
They looked at me, one of the kids raised his hand and said,
37:40
you know how to play prism ball?
37:41
I said, you’ll see.
37:42
It was one of my favorite games.
37:44
So, then, I was a captain.
37:46
I chose the smallest and the weakest child in the room, which I knew
37:49
nobody would want on their team.
37:51
I chose him first.
37:53
They all just laughed.
37:55
I said, don’t laugh at anybody.
37:57
I got my team ready.
37:58
I already knew who I was going to get out—that big, tall boy.
38:00
Went outside to play, and I bounced the ball—oh, I tossed it up, that’s right.
38:05
Whoever grabbed the ball would be the first.
38:07
I tried to do everything according to scale because I didn’t
38:11
want the kids cheating at all.
38:13
I bounced the ball a little bit.
38:15
I looked at the kid over here, the little kid like I was going to hit him.
38:18
Had the ball, and I looked at him, and I threw it to the big, and I got him out.
38:22
The kids went wild.
38:24
I’ll tell ya, from then on I had no problems with them.
38:27
I really missed the one.
38:29
When I got ready to leave, because we were only there—I would just stay at west
38:33
side school for one year because we wanted to have children before we got home.
38:38
The big kid, the 14-year-old, came and hugged me, and he had tears in his eyes.
38:44
It was a good experience for me.
38:45
The first time I had taught in a segregated school.
38:48
The first time I really learned those kids were not as the people would say dumb.
38:54
They were pulled out of their homes and out of school at 2 or
38:58
3 months to work in the fields.
39:00
How are you going to get an education if you’re out in the fields 2
39:04
months out of the year in school?
39:07
Two months out of the year?
39:08
That’s what happened, but I enjoyed it.
39:12
Then, when did you come back?
39:15
You came back to Oregon?
39:17
Yeah, we came back to Oregon.
39:18
We were in the service 3 years.
39:22
We came back and my first, we had our first son born in Las Vegas.
39:28
We came back and then I signed up again to teach and my mother watched my son for me.
39:36
In between we had more children, and I did substituting, because I
39:42
wanted to keep up my certificate.
39:44
I didn’t work every day, but I worked enough days to keep up my certificate.
39:49
In the meantime, then, what did your husband do?
39:51
He was a dentist.
39:54
How did he get into dentistry?
39:59
How’d he get into dentistry?
40:00
He went through about the same thing I went through.
40:03
He came in, and he’s always wanted to be a dentist.
40:05
He was debating being a dentist or a physician.
40:07
He tried, he passed the test and everything, but the dental school
40:11
wouldn’t accept him because of his color.
40:14
But, we had a Black legislator—I can’t think of his name now—and he went to
40:20
him and they got him in dental school.
40:22
He said, there’s no reason for them not accepting him.
40:25
He passed all the papers, all the tests, and was remarkable at it.
40:32
They got him in.
40:34
Politics, that’s what did it.
40:36
So, he had a rough time, though, that first year.
40:39
Of course, the dental school had a slot open automatically for the Mormons.
40:46
You’re from Utah, and it’s been that way for years.
40:50
Whenever they graduated from college, they just automatically go into dental school.
40:57
It’s still existing, but you don’t hear too much about it, which meant that about,
41:02
oh maybe around a fourth of the class, between a fourth and a third were Mormons.
41:08
Naturally, when they got in, in the dental school, the Mormons would
41:11
form the fraternities, they studied together, they excluded my husband.
41:17
He learned to study by himself, which was the best thing he could do.
41:21
Then, there was one Mormon, his name was Pete.
41:25
He, somehow or another, took a liking to Clarence.
41:29
One day he said, can we have a cup of coffee?
41:33
Clarence said, well, I’ll see.
41:35
Clarence wasn’t interested in any of them.
41:37
He came home to me and told me, he said, you know there’s one fella named Pete.
41:39
He keeps asking me to have coffee with him.
41:41
I don’t know why.
41:42
He says, he’s a Mormon.
41:44
I said, why don’t you find out?
41:45
Have coffee.
41:46
Coffee’s not going to hurt you.
41:47
He said, okay.
41:49
So, he did.
41:50
He came home, he said, guess what he told me?
41:53
He said, told me to, they had those white, long white shirts that they wore.
41:58
Big pockets.
41:59
He said, any time that you do your carving on your
42:06
teeth, he said, you put it in your pocket and you go to the bathroom,
42:10
the restroom, you put it in your pocket and take it with you.
42:14
He said, why?
42:14
He says, because one time that you left the instructor said that Mr.
42:20
Pruitt has had the best carvings of any student that I’ve had over these years.
42:26
He says, it’s perfect.
42:28
Of course, they didn’t want to accept that.
42:31
Because they didn’t want him in the class anyway.
42:33
What they would do, he would leave it on the table, they’d
42:36
take a knife and they’d cut.
42:38
They’d do something, and he’d have to do it over.
42:41
He said, and I’m just telling you this, he said you don’t need to tell,
42:46
let her know that I told you, he said.
42:49
But I would keep it with me.
42:51
So, Clarence did.
42:52
He started keeping it with him.
42:53
He said he didn’t have to do anything over.
42:56
Then he knew that they really were trying to sabotage him.
43:01
He had some rough times, but he stuck with it.
43:06
Which school was this?
43:07
University of Oregon Dental School.
43:10
Yeah.
43:11
Then he started practicing dentistry.
43:17
Well, after he graduated, then he went through some more
43:21
segregation, discrimination, trying to get an office downtown.
43:26
Medical school said, no we don’t want any Blacks.
43:29
All of the schools.
43:31
But, he had a friend, Paul Kunkel, and his father was a dentist, and he met
43:37
Clarence, and he liked Clarence very much.
43:39
Dr. Kunkel.
43:40
He was in the Selling Building.
43:42
He said, you mean to tell me with the grades that he was doing and the carving
43:47
that he was doing that they’re not going to let him be a dentist downtown.
43:50
He couldn’t believe that.
43:52
He said, okay.
43:54
He called the dentist in the Selling Building.
43:56
He said, we’re having a new dentist coming in next week or so.
44:02
He’s going to have the office right across from mine, and that’s it.
44:07
he wouldn’t even let them talk about it.
44:09
He said, he’ll be in this building, and I don’t want to hear anything else about it.
44:13
Sure enough, Dr. Kunkel followed through.
44:16
When Clarence, he told Clarence, I’ve got a room for you in the Selling Building
44:19
on the 10th floor right across from me.
44:24
His son was also a dentist.
44:26
He and Clarence were very good friends.
44:28
When he opened his dental practice that day, Dr. Kunkel had 3 patients for
44:33
him that that he referred to Clarence.
44:36
They were really impressed with the job that he done.
44:39
Dr. Kunkel and his wife were friends for us for years.
44:43
Now, his son is still friends of ours.
44:46
His son is retired and has 5 children, and they’re still friends.
44:53
He had that support from the dentist.
44:56
Were there other clients that would come in and look at your husband and say, nope.
45:02
Get me a different dentist?
45:04
No.
45:04
He never had that.
45:06
I think one reason why, at that time, a lot of them were referrals.
45:12
I’m sure if they referred them to Clarence they knew that he was a Black American.
45:20
They knew.
45:21
Not only that, his work was quality work and that’s what stood on.
45:26
He was an excellent dentist.
45:28
Did he attract other Black Americans to go to him in particular?
45:34
Oh yeah.
45:34
After he got established downtown, he didn’t have any problem.
45:38
He didn’t have any problems at all.
45:39
A lot of them were our friends and they started going to him.
45:42
He had a well-integrated staff, or—
45:47
I was wondering whether, okay, yeah, just friends, and he was a good
45:50
dentist, so they would go to him, but whether there were other African
45:55
Americans that didn’t him at all, but chose to go to him because.
46:01
Yeah.
46:01
It was referral.
46:03
They’d say, who’s a good dentist, and they found out it was Clarence and
46:07
he was a Black, because he was the only dentist, Black dentist there.
46:10
He had no problems with that.
46:12
It was good, because it was downtown, which they didn’t want Blacks downtown
46:17
in business period, and he held his own.
46:20
He did a good job.
46:25
Let’s kind of move along here.
46:30
Have you been active in many community activities, politics, civil rights?
46:38
I was very active in the Urban League, but you know, after you have a family
46:44
and you’re still working on a career, you don’t really have a whole lot
46:48
of time to do that, but I stayed with the Urban League for years.
46:53
I worked in trying to get people to understand the importance of
46:59
integration and I used to have it in my home and I’ve always done that
47:04
kind of thing, but politics, no.
47:07
I just didn’t trust the people in politics.
47:10
I just didn’t.
47:13
So many of them are running for power for themselves, not necessarily
47:17
an issue that was prevalent.
47:19
In terms of in the ‘60s and ‘70s when there was so much civil rights
47:28
activities going on in Portland, what were you doing in relation to those?
47:35
Well, you know, I was still working, working full-time and still with a family.
47:42
When you work and you got a family, you don’t have time for a lot of activity.
47:47
What I did, I joined every organization that were—always had membership in
47:52
those organizations: Urban League,
47:56
NAACP, any organizations promoting education, anything that was integration,
48:01
I was involved in those kinds of things.
48:06
As joining, then, so you become a member and give money, but did you ever have any
48:13
time do any actual activities with them?
48:17
Yes, I did with the Urban League Guild.
48:20
I was very active in the Urban League Guild.
48:22
Again,
48:25
people were just not aware of the problems that were out there in race relations, and
48:34
so in joining the Urban League Guild, I had a lot of people in my home for lunches
48:39
and we had speakers that would come.
48:42
Then I would give, we had teas in different people’s homes and I tried
48:47
to get homes of Caucasians that really were not aware of what was going on but
48:52
had lovely homes on the southwest side.
48:54
They became very good friends of mine.
48:56
In that way, we were able to integrate and get speakers.
48:59
Things like that, I did.
49:03
Which brings me to the question, which we really
49:07
don’t know yet is to, so at that time where were you living?
49:13
When I was married with my children?
49:14
Yeah.
49:15
This time that we’re talking about.
49:16
Oh, okay, I lived on Kelly Street Southeast, the southeast area on
49:21
Kelly Street, which is between Powell Boulevard and Division.
49:27
That’s where my son lives, on Kelly Street.
49:31
Really?
49:31
Yes.
49:32
What street?
49:32
It’s between...
49:36
What’s the number?
49:39
Twenty-six.
49:39
You’re kidding.
49:40
It’s between 26th and 27th, right by the high school.
49:44
Oh, for heaven’s sakes [chuckles]
49:46
. Okay, that’s another story.
49:49
Well, he wasn’t too far from us.
49:50
We were on 36th and Kelly.
49:52
Yeah.
49:53
That was a whole different story, too.
49:56
They put up a petition when they found out Blacks were going to buy the home.
50:00
They put up a petition, and everybody on that street except
50:03
two families signed the petition.
50:05
When we moved in on Kelly Street, we moved in at night.
50:10
What year was that?
50:10
[Take a deep breath] . Let’s say, that was 1950-something.
50:11
I’m trying to think, about ’58.
50:11
No, yeah,
50:22
about
50:26
’56, ’58.
50:27
Somewhere around there.
50:28
I can’t remember exactly.
50:30
Where did you move from?
50:32
Las Vegas.
50:33
Oh, so that’s when you came back from Las Vegas.
50:37
Uh-huh, after we came back from Las Vegas.
50:37
We stayed with my parents until we could find
50:42
a home, and Clarence went to—he looked for a home, but he had to do it at night.
50:47
Because they knew that a Black person, and those neighbors at that
50:50
time, they would not sell to us.
50:53
Tell us more about that.
50:54
Did they have the for sale signs, so they traced...?
50:57
He had a realtor, and he was a Black realtor at the time
51:03
and he found this house.
51:06
The people that were in the house was a social worker, and
51:11
the neighbors didn’t like her.
51:12
She had a daughter, and she was ready to move.
51:17
When she found out that they did not want any Blacks, she said she
51:22
was going to paint the house red.
51:24
That was another stereotype and then move and leave them.
51:29
Tell me about that stereotype of red.
51:31
I don’t know about that one.
51:33
Oh, there was a stereotype, at the time that they felt that all Blacks like red.
51:39
You know, and they’d have things like Aunt Jemima with the red scarf on.
51:42
All those stereotype things that were ignorant.
51:45
She thought, well, if they don’t like her and she’s going to move,
51:48
she’ll paint the whole house red.
51:51
But she didn’t do it.
51:52
Anyway, she sold us the house, and we had to move in at night.
51:59
We moved in at night.
52:01
I wasn’t afraid.
52:02
Everybody said, aren’t you afraid?
52:03
I said, no.
52:04
The irony of it was, on the corner across the street, a Mr. West was a Black man.
52:10
He had been living there for years before the people that had
52:13
the petition were living there.
52:16
These were strong Catholics.
52:18
Every Friday they would walk up our street to go to the church.
52:22
They had church on Friday, too, and I’d be out working in the
52:25
yard, because I love yard work.
52:27
They’d look up and see me and roll their eyes and go on.
52:30
This happened Friday after Friday after Friday, until, and I was teaching
52:35
school at the time, until Clarence said, the kids wanted a swimming pool.
52:41
I said, well, okay, we’ll put it in the backyard.
52:44
We have our three sons.
52:46
He put the swimming pool up and then another couple moved across the street.
52:50
They were really friendly, and we’re still friends.
52:52
She wasn’t involved in all that because she came afterwards.
52:56
She said that the neighbors called her, and said they knew
52:59
that she was friends of mine.
53:01
We’ve decided that we could use her pool on Thursday if one of us would sit there
53:06
and watch the kids so no one gets hurt.
53:10
Well, Joyce didn’t know the background.
53:12
She said, okay, I’m sure Joy wouldn’t mine.
53:15
I’ll go over and tell her.
53:16
She came over and told me, and I told her the whole background.
53:19
Her mouth fell open.
53:20
She couldn’t believe it.
53:22
I said, yes.
53:22
They discriminated against me, and now they want to use my pool.
53:27
I said, not one of them will set foot on my property, and I stuck to it, too.
53:33
The only person was Joyce.
53:34
Her and her son.
53:35
Her son and my son were just like this.
53:39
Explain a little bit more about the petition.
53:43
Well, I never saw the petition, but my husband did.
53:47
It was a petition that actually indicated they did not want any, I
53:52
don’t know what word they used, I’m just saying Negroes, probably, in
53:57
their neighborhood buying a home.
53:59
They said, all White neighborhood and we’re going to keep it that way.
54:01
That kind of thing was on it.
54:03
I didn’t want to see.
54:05
I had had enough discrimination coming up.
54:07
I didn’t want to see it in writing.
54:09
Who did they give that petition to?
54:11
I don’t know.
54:11
I didn’t follow through.
54:12
It didn’t do any good, because we moved in by then.
54:16
What they did, they just ignored us until we got the pool [laughs]
54:22
. How long did you live there?
54:23
I lived there up until 30 years ago when I had this home built.
54:29
Tell us now about this home.
54:31
Actually, Clarence was practicing dentistry and one of his patients, which
54:38
was Caucasian, had bought the lot and she her husband were going to get married.
54:44
Well, she and her fiancé were going to get married and build.
54:47
Well, it didn’t work out.
54:49
She needed the money.
54:51
She told Clarence, I have a lot in Lake Oswego.
54:53
Are you interested in buying it?
54:55
Clarence said, well, let me check with my wife.
54:58
He called me.
55:00
I said, Clarence that sounds Cucamonga.
55:02
He laughed, well, it might be a good investment.
55:05
I said, fine.
55:06
I was always ready for investments.
55:08
I said, okay.
55:09
So, we bought the lot.
55:10
They didn’t, the neighbors around here didn’t know we had, we had the lot
55:13
almost 25 years before we built on it.
55:16
Because we didn’t build on it until I retired.
55:19
I took early retirement.
55:21
The reason why we even built on it, because my husband was getting sick
55:25
at the time and it was difficult for him to walk up the steps.
55:31
Where we lived, we had stairs all the way up in there.
55:33
Yeah, it does have.
55:33
Right, right.
55:36
I went to the doctor, and the doctor said you know these steps are
55:40
getting too hard for your husband.
55:41
I said, well, I said we can build.
55:44
We do have a lot to build on.
55:46
He said, your husband is not going to be able to handle that.
55:49
He said, do you think you will?
55:50
I said, I know I can.
55:51
Yes, I can build.
55:53
Because I’ve been going to the street of dreams for years.
55:56
I knew what I wanted.
55:57
I wanted all on one level so he can come in the double doors, etc. because
56:02
I retired then, and I started having this house built.
56:07
I was here every day.
56:10
I’m not kidding you.
56:10
I was here every day.
56:12
I stayed with the
56:15
Fullers, because she and I
56:20
lived apart from each other about 4 blocks when we were kids going to school.
56:27
I stayed with her, was every day, and had the house built so Clarence was
56:31
able to come in on the main floor.
56:36
What is your relation with the neighbors here?
56:39
They’re very nice.
56:41
I have no complaints about the neighbors around here.
56:44
The people here, they’re new, and they just built the house next door.
56:49
Before I built the house, my sister, I brought my sister out
56:52
here to show her the lot and told her where I was going to build and
56:55
had beautiful view and the sunset.
57:00
Anyway, we were standing there talking.
57:01
We had just come from church.
57:03
We thought we were looking sort of cute.
57:04
Let me tell you, that was knocked out.
57:06
A woman drove up in a white car.
57:08
She stopped.
57:09
It was a blonde woman, and she stopped, and she rolled the
57:12
window down and she said, hi!
57:14
I said, hello.
57:15
She said, can I help you with anything?
57:18
Thinking she was nice.
57:19
I said, oh, no, no thank you.
57:21
She said, well, what are you doing here then?
57:24
She threw me.
57:25
I could not believe the change in personality in a matter... Beverly
57:29
stood there and looked at her.
57:31
I was so mad at that woman.
57:33
I said to her, it’s none of your business.
57:37
She said, well, I’ll make it my business then and put on the gas and took off.
57:44
Don’t know who she was.
57:45
Then what happened?
57:46
Well, it’s sort of a sad story, the fact that I went ahead and built.
57:53
Neighbors down around the corner came and drove by and he stopped.
57:59
She didn’t, she says hi.
58:00
I said, hello.
58:01
We talked.
58:03
She invited me over for tea, but she was a blonde woman, I
58:06
thought it was the same woman.
58:07
I really did.
58:08
Not just once, I felt that way for a few years.
58:12
He’s the one that takes care of all the music in Lake Oswego and has concerts
58:19
and things at the park down there.
58:21
He was very friendly.
58:23
She was friendly, too, but she kept inviting me over for tea.
58:25
I told her no.
58:28
I just didn’t trust her.
58:29
I just knew that was the same woman.
58:31
After about 5 or 6 years I finally, he finally came by and he says
58:36
my wife has been inviting you for tea for the past 5 years.
58:40
He says, and you won’t come.
58:43
So, I said to him, come on in and I’m going to tell you why.
58:45
So, I told him the story.
58:47
He says, oh.
58:49
He said, wasn’t my wife.
58:51
She’s just the opposite.
58:53
I said, well this has been going on... I felt this way because,
58:57
number one, your wife is blonde.
59:00
Your wife drove a white car, this woman drove a white.
59:02
It was just everything, but I didn’t see the woman long enough, but it’s just that.
59:07
I was stereotyping.
59:08
I admitted.
59:09
Anyway, to make a long story short—they became very good friends.
59:12
Then he invited me to his picnic, and I was shocked in his yard.
59:17
He had Asians and Africans and everything I believed.
59:23
It was integrated, I mean well-integrated.
59:25
They all knew each other.
59:26
See,
59:29
that’s what segregation, discrimination, racial hatred will do.
59:33
It sets you in a mindset, and you just don’t want to be bothered with, and it
59:38
really almost ruined a good relationship.
59:45
Let’s talk a little bit about your family that you raised and your
59:48
children and how you raised them.
59:51
Well, I raised them
59:55
like my mother and father raised me, with a lot of love and a lot
59:58
of education in the background.
1:00:02
Mother, my mother and dad are also the type of person that always
1:00:04
took somebody else in, if they want to be an extension of the family.
1:00:09
They have done that.
1:00:09
They had 2 or 3 people who just thought the world of it.
1:00:14
I’ve done the same thing.
1:00:15
I have taken a couple of gals in.
1:00:20
One is Faye.
1:00:21
She’s the one that Clarence, we consider her our daughter.
1:00:24
He taught her the dental school, because her mother died of cancer years ago.
1:00:30
Then the other was Deborah, Deborah Brown.
1:00:40
She had her doctorate degree, and then she decided she wanted to be a minister,
1:00:44
so she went back to school and got her... she’s now Reverend Dr. Brown.
1:00:52
She asked me if I’d go to her graduation, which was in Chicago.
1:00:56
I said, sure.
1:00:58
That’s what we’ve done.
1:00:59
A couple people we’ve just taken in as part of our family.
1:01:05
In fact, they are the family, consider them.
1:01:08
How many children do you have?
1:01:09
I consider myself having 5 children—five boys biological, and two girls.
1:01:15
The two girls are the ones you took in?
1:01:17
Mm-hmm.
1:01:18
Then the three...
1:01:19
Boys are bio—
1:01:21
Did they all grow up, then, on Kelly Street?
1:01:24
Oh yeah, my three boys did.
1:01:28
What were their experiences?
1:01:29
That’s already the next generation.
1:01:32
The next generation—we experienced some.
1:01:35
We took them to St.—well, actually, we pulled Michael, the oldest out of school.
1:01:41
He was going to Creston School, elementary, and the PE
1:01:46
teacher was very prejudiced.
1:01:49
He accused my son of doing something, which he didn’t do.
1:01:51
He tried to tell him, and they guy—he’s the type that would grab people and shake,
1:01:55
you know, and yell and scream at them.
1:01:57
Well, Michael wasn’t raised that way.
1:02:00
So, he scared Michael to death.
1:02:02
Michael left the school that day he was yelling and went on
1:02:05
down to downtown and got his dad and told his dad what happened.
1:02:11
Clarence finished dental, he went back up to the school, Creston,
1:02:14
which was good because he was also doing free dental work at the
1:02:18
Creston School, so they all knew him.
1:02:22
He talked to the principal and told the principal what happened.
1:02:24
Well, he found out that the man, this PE teacher had been doing that to
1:02:27
other kids, but they didn’t complain.
1:02:31
So, to make a long story short, he lost his job.
1:02:36
The PE teacher?
1:02:37
Yeah, the PE teacher, he lost his job.
1:02:40
Clarence was going to, was insistent that he not be around kids.
1:02:45
My husband ran into him, maybe about 4 years later, and he recognized
1:02:52
Clarence and said, you’re the one that made me lose my job!
1:02:55
Clarence, said, no I didn’t.
1:02:56
You made yourself lose the job.
1:02:59
But my kids experienced some prejudice, but nothing like I did.
1:03:09
Of course, the schools they were going to were mainly all White.
1:03:13
By then, were there some other African Americans living there?
1:03:16
Well, we transferred him to the episcopal school, St. Helens,
1:03:20
you know St. Helens Hall.
1:03:23
Well, we transferred him because it’s a private school, and there,
1:03:27
yes, there were 1, 2, 3—at least about 5 or 6 Black Americans there.
1:03:32
That was a good school.
1:03:34
We kept him there until he graduated and went to University of San Francisco.
1:03:42
My middle son went to the Black college in Atlanta, Georgia.
1:03:48
What’s the Black college there?
1:03:49
Morehouse?
1:03:50
Morehouse.
1:03:51
He went to Morehouse.
1:03:51
Then, my youngest shocked me to no end, he chose Linfield.
1:03:57
He didn’t tell me until about maybe a week before he got ready to leave.
1:04:01
I was really shocked.
1:04:02
But he went and he finished.
1:04:05
He said it was a good educational experience.
1:04:07
Then,
1:04:10
the two girls that we adopted,
1:04:15
one finished the dental school, which my husband taught her in dental school.
1:04:22
The other, as I said, got her doctorate and her reverend.
1:04:26
They’re all—all of them have their education.
1:04:30
Tell us something, this is kind of a different kind of
1:04:35
subject, tell us something about,
1:04:40
well, what you like to do for enjoyment, aside from gardening, entertainment.
1:04:51
What is your other part of your life, your social fun side?
1:04:56
Well, I—fun side?
1:04:58
Well, my friends and my relatives they all know my door is open anytime.
1:05:03
I always have coffee or tea for them.
1:05:07
I played tennis for years up until, well, up until last year.
1:05:15
I loved it.
1:05:16
My sister and I played it.
1:05:17
We belonged to Marion’s Tennis Club—he’s the only Black person
1:05:22
that owns a tennis club in Portland.
1:05:23
When he first opened up, my sister and I decided that we were
1:05:27
going to support him.
1:05:28
We’ve been there ever since.
1:05:31
This last year, I did not play tennis.
1:05:35
Well, I played up until last year, March 31st, that was my birthday.
1:05:40
I decided I’m going to give myself a tennis party, which I did.
1:05:44
Wait a minute, now hold are you?
1:05:45
How old do you think I am?
1:05:48
Well, tell the um...
1:05:49
Oh [laughs] . I’m 89.
1:05:53
Well, that’s... you’ve been playing tennis up until you were 88.
1:05:59
88. Uh-huh, and the only reason—
1:06:00
That is amazing.
1:06:02
The only reason why I really stopped it because of, well, I got vertigo.
1:06:06
I got real dizzy and then my right knee started bothering me, but I loved it.
1:06:12
Anyway, I played recreational.
1:06:14
I played
1:06:17
tennis.
1:06:18
Ping-pong I’m really good at it [laughs] . I’m not bragging.
1:06:21
Do you play ping-pong?
1:06:24
I played the secretary of state,
1:06:29
Richardson.
1:06:31
I played him.
1:06:31
He came to the house.
1:06:32
I played him.
1:06:33
Then he invited me down to Salem and we played down there.
1:06:38
It was fun.
1:06:39
I love sports, and I think that’s what got me through school so easily, as
1:06:45
far teaching was concerned, because most kids have all that energy.
1:06:50
When I see them getting a little restless, I take them out and play sports with them.
1:06:55
I didn’t tell them what to do.
1:06:56
I played with them.
1:06:57
They loved it.
1:06:58
I never had any discipline problems at all teaching, because
1:07:02
sports and music were part of it.
1:07:07
Tell us more about the music.
1:07:10
Well, I came from a music family.
1:07:12
My sister majored in music, my oldest sister, so she used to play
1:07:15
in the choir at Bethel Church.
1:07:19
I just loved.
1:07:20
We grew up singing and harmonizing.
1:07:23
As far as professionalism, I just played by ear.
1:07:27
I don’t know how, but I love music.
1:07:32
I used to have, Bill Rutherford, and some of his friends come over and play from
1:07:39
10:00 until about 1:00 I’d fix lunch for them, and they’d play musical instruments.
1:07:47
All of them that you see back there.
1:07:48
I loved it.
1:07:50
I loved it.
1:07:51
Then he moved to Eugene.
1:07:54
Tell us about this accumulation of, tell us what the instruments are
1:07:58
that you have and how you got them.
1:08:01
Well, Vibraharp, my husband was going to take Vibraharp lessons.
1:08:05
We’ve always loved it.
1:08:07
Then he got sick, and so he just sort of played by ear.
1:08:10
Piano I play by ear.
1:08:12
The bass—we were both going to take lessons, because we love the sound
1:08:16
of it, but then he got sick, so I didn’t follow through on that.
1:08:21
The organ, is just like a piano, really.
1:08:24
I play that by ear.
1:08:27
When I was teaching school, I played
1:08:32
the bass, ukulele.
1:08:34
You know, it has a rich sound to it.
1:08:37
Kids love music.
1:08:39
If they got a little restless at all, I’d just say, let’s sing a couple songs.
1:08:42
We’d stop what we’re doing and I’d play and they’d all sing.
1:08:46
That’s just, music is within me.
1:08:48
I loved it.
1:08:49
As you grew up, was there music in your household?
1:08:52
Oh, yes, when we were little growing up, as poor as we were
1:08:57
mother and dad got a piano.
1:08:59
That’s where my oldest sister started taking lessons.
1:09:02
She had an ear for music.
1:09:04
When our friends would come in, especially with teenagers, we’d come and we’d all
1:09:08
sit around the piano and sing and then we’d dance and just had a lot of fun
1:09:13
with music, because you know we didn’t have any money to go out and go anywhere,
1:09:16
but we always had fun with music.
1:09:19
It’s been basic for me.
1:09:21
Your friends that you had then as a teenager, were they all
1:09:25
African Americans or was it mixed?
1:09:28
Yeah.
1:09:29
They were all African Americans because there wasn’t any
1:09:34
integration, really, much.
1:09:36
Even the ones that I went to high school with, they were friendly but
1:09:40
then the restaurants wouldn’t let us in and skating rinks wouldn’t let us in.
1:09:49
You end up with the people that you’re comfortable with
1:09:51
and you can do things with.
1:09:53
Let’s get back to our music.
1:09:56
Then, in your household, so your sister took lessons and you sang.
1:10:02
Yeah, we sang.
1:10:03
We harmonized.
1:10:03
All my sisters and I knew how to harmonize.
1:10:06
My friends came in.
1:10:08
They were good, too.
1:10:09
We thought we were really good.
1:10:12
Did the music come partly from church?
1:10:15
Yeah.
1:10:16
A lot of it did.
1:10:17
Then the modern songs that were coming out.
1:10:21
But, basically, church, because church always has such good harmony in it.
1:10:26
You know, you’d hear the Mills Brothers, the Ink Spots, and all them
1:10:29
sing there’d be a beautiful harmony.
1:10:32
All my friends they had a good ear for it.
1:10:36
We had many, many days of music that we enjoyed.
1:10:44
Up until now, are you still getting together with people?
1:10:47
No, Bill...Bill Rutherford decided to go to Eugene because he was
1:10:53
a great grandfather by then.
1:10:55
He was proud of that.
1:10:57
He’s only been down there about 3, 3 or 4 years.
1:11:01
When he left it sort of broke up the group.
1:11:05
I haven’t had anybody come in since then.
1:11:08
If you know anybody likes to play music wants to come and
1:11:10
just—they are more than welcome.
1:11:13
You
1:11:18
have music and sports.
1:11:21
What else?
1:11:23
I like to read, too.
1:11:26
Well, entertain.
1:11:28
My husband and I always did entertain.
1:11:31
We’ve had as many as 30 sit-down, 30 people for sit-down dinners
1:11:38
and barbeque out in the backyard.
1:11:41
It’s just friends we’ve been making all along.
1:11:45
I just had, my home’s always been open.
1:11:48
My mother was the same way.
1:11:51
She always had her home open to all of our friends.
1:11:55
They’d stay until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, but we knew that mother and
1:11:57
dad were upstairs, so nothing went wrong
1:12:03
[laughs]
1:12:03
. What kind of occasions do you entertain for?
1:12:07
Well, I told you about the Saturday Sisters.
1:12:10
That’s on one day out of the month, and I have one of those days and the rest of
1:12:17
them have, each one has a day out a month.
1:12:22
I have had, for years, Christmas party with family.
1:12:28
Also, New Year’s Day party for years.
1:12:31
That’s when we get about 30 people.
1:12:35
I usually cater the food in, as far as the meat, barbeque chicken and
1:12:41
barbeque ribs, and then the friends would bring salads and desert stuff.
1:12:46
That’s usually January the
1:12:51
1st.
1:12:51
We’ve done that for 30, 40 years.
1:12:54
Let’s talk a little bit about Christmas.
1:12:56
Tell us about how your family...
1:12:59
We meet here.
1:13:00
...celebrates.
1:13:00
They still meet here, thank goodness.
1:13:02
I usually have the tree right there.
1:13:05
They come and they bring their kids and they’re all grown now.
1:13:10
My grandkids are all now in college, all 3 of them.
1:13:14
Then anybody that’s out that doesn’t have a family, that’s new in
1:13:19
town, somebody always brings them.
1:13:23
It’s all my family.
1:13:25
Describe it in detail like I’ve never seen it, if you were going to—
1:13:30
I decorate, okay the Christmas tree goes right there, fully decorated,
1:13:35
and all the gifts go under there.
1:13:37
Then I have all these tables and I have Christmas decorations on
1:13:43
the tables and Christmas music and they come and we laugh, cocktails.
1:13:49
Then after that, we will, this is Christmas and New
1:13:53
Year’s, because I do both.
1:13:54
Well, start with just one at a time.
1:13:56
Okay, well the Christmas is just...
1:13:57
Christmas.
1:13:57
...close family, close family.
1:13:59
That usually is about 15, 15/16 people.
1:13:59
So, that’s,
1:14:05
like...
1:14:05
That’s my, the close family is my 5 children and then their, my
1:14:12
grandchildren, that’s 8, then my son and his girlfriend, Roxanne.
1:14:20
My other son and his friend and the one in Atlanta, Georgia, he does come up then.
1:14:29
Then I have, well, my mother is another one that would sort of adopt friends.
1:14:36
I have what we call an adopted sister.
1:14:38
She comes.
1:14:41
It’s usually about 15 at that particular time.
1:14:47
All the grandkids.
1:14:48
Then, on New Year’s Day, January 1st, it’s just been a tradition for years,
1:14:53
that all our friends and all of our relatives, and it usually ends up
1:14:56
anywhere between 25 and 30 people.
1:14:59
As I say, that’s when we do the barbeque and
1:15:05
they all bring salads and desserts and we eat.
1:15:09
We sing.
1:15:10
We play ping pong.
1:15:12
Play cards.
1:15:14
For Christmas, what do you eat for Christmas?
1:15:17
Turkey.
1:15:18
Turkey and ham, and the usual—baked potatoes, candied
1:15:23
yams, vegetable salad, desserts.
1:15:26
What kind of desserts?
1:15:28
Whatever somebody brings.
1:15:30
Cakes.
1:15:32
Pies.
1:15:34
That’s usually it.
1:15:36
So, you prepare, what do you prepare and what part of the means do
1:15:40
other people, for Christmas, now.
1:15:42
Okay, what I prepare, I prepare the caterer to bring me my barbeque chicken
1:15:49
[laughs] . Barbeque chicken and barbeque.
1:15:52
We have ham.
1:15:53
I do the ham.
1:15:55
Usually the meat and then all the other stuff that people bring.
1:16:00
So, but you don’t cook it yourself, the meat?
1:16:02
No, I used to cook mustard greens and collard greens, but you get
1:16:06
that many people you get tired after a while, so you spread it out.
1:16:11
We still have it, though, and I still enjoy it.
1:16:15
They bring their own wines, because you wouldn’t believe it, all the
1:16:17
entertainment that we’ve done, my husband and I, I don’t drink.
1:16:21
But if you go in there you see all those wine bottles.
1:16:24
They bring it, and I tell them: take it home, if you’ll drink it.
1:16:27
They don’t take it home.
1:16:30
So, it’s there.
1:16:30
You have a whole case of it.
1:16:34
On the other occasions when you invite people, is it all African Americans
1:16:42
or do you now have some circle of friends that are both White and...?
1:16:48
Oh yeah, because the first place my relatives, it’s integrated relatives.
1:16:54
My, for my daughter, is married to a Caucasian.
1:17:01
She lives out in, she has a farm.
1:17:05
She has horses, three or four, but her husband is Caucasian.
1:17:10
Some of my friends, they come, their spouses are Caucasian.
1:17:14
So, it’s integrated.
1:17:19
I have a couple of Asian friends that come.
1:17:22
You probably know them, Nola?
1:17:23
You know Nola?
1:17:24
Bougo?
1:17:25
Not yet.
1:17:26
She’s on that list...
1:17:27
Oh, really?
1:17:28
...that…gave me.
1:17:29
Oh, Nola and I have known each other for years.
1:17:31
She was first, her first husband was a Black man, and they had a night club
1:17:37
there on Lincoln, Southwest Lincoln.
1:17:40
That’s where I first—she used to sing there all the time.
1:17:43
Then he passed away, and then she remarried.
1:17:45
We’re still friends.
1:17:51
It’s integrated.
1:17:51
Then I’ve always had some of my college, some of my college friends.
1:17:57
Since I’ve moved here in Lake Oswego, I’ve met some friends that owned a couple
1:18:02
restaurants I used to go and eat in.
1:18:04
They come up and we have tea and that’s just sort of a normal, natural thing.
1:18:10
So, there’s probably been a change from those experiences that you’ve had as
1:18:16
a child from being ostracized to...
1:18:21
Integrated.
1:18:22
...a gradual type of integration.
1:18:25
Yeah, because you know things do change.
1:18:27
People’s attitudes do change, even though sometimes it’s hard to see, but prejudice
1:18:35
and discrimination is a learned behavior.
1:18:39
It is learned and that’s why I know it can be eradicated
1:18:44
if people really realize that.
1:18:46
When I was teaching kindergarten one of the children brought a book.
1:18:51
It was a pickaninny book.
1:18:54
He was just so cute.
1:18:56
He said, would you read this to my class.
1:18:58
Of course, this was a Black person with big red lips.
1:19:02
Oh.
1:19:03
I couldn’t.
1:19:05
I said, well, let me put it aside.
1:19:07
I have other books that kids want, children want me to read.
1:19:13
When I got through, I said, take this book back to your mom and
1:19:17
take this letter that I wrote her.
1:19:19
I wrote her and I told her, you know, discrimination and segregation
1:19:22
is all taught, and it’s taught through stereotype and misbeliefs.
1:19:27
I said, this book will do more damage than anything.
1:19:31
She didn’t realize.
1:19:32
But I wrote it so it wouldn’t ostracize her, but she could really
1:19:36
internalize what I was saying.
1:19:37
When I got through, she wrote me the nicest letter.
1:19:40
I still have the letter somewhere.
1:19:42
I had no idea.
1:19:44
She said, at night when he goes to bed this is what we’d read to him.
1:19:48
So, I sent her a list of books that she could read to him
1:19:52
that she would eliminate that.
1:19:53
She said she threw it away.
1:19:55
But the letter meant a lot to me, because that meant that she internalized what I
1:19:59
was saying and did something about it.
1:20:04
Those are the kinds of teaching and education that I really like.
1:20:09
You can wake people up.
1:20:11
What about in terms of thinking about this kind of change.
1:20:18
You’re a very reflective person, so in, how have your own, did your
1:20:27
own attitudes change some in terms of how then you were addressing
1:20:35
the relations with White people?
1:20:40
Did my attitude change?
1:20:44
You mean, change you mean negative or positive or what?
1:20:48
Well, your way of responding.
1:20:52
I was thinking that, you know, you talked about the stereotyping
1:20:57
which goes both ways with
1:21:02
that experience with the blonde haired woman you had mistaken for someone else.
1:21:09
I’m just wondering if through the years
1:21:14
as people have, as some people might start having the different responses
1:21:20
to the African Americans, whether then in turn you begin to have
1:21:25
some different responses that are—
1:21:32
I don’t know if I’ve had any different responses, because, you
1:21:36
see, like I said prejudice was taught.
1:21:39
My parents re-taught in a way that you can’t hold that against them.
1:21:45
You have to think about what your goals are.
1:21:48
In that way, I don’t think that I changed in that.
1:21:50
I’ve been more open to integration, definitely, and
1:21:56
I’ve told my kids the same thing.
1:21:57
The
1:22:00
only time that I felt really uncomfortable, it was a short
1:22:04
period of time, is when I visited the Black museum in Washington,
1:22:08
D.C., which was about 3 weeks ago.
1:22:12
A lot of things there, even though you knew on the top of your head existed,
1:22:17
when you really saw it in reality the thing that went through my mind was how
1:22:23
can a race of people hate somebody so much that they didn’t even know them?
1:22:29
How can they throw the families into the water?
1:22:32
The children... how can you throw a baby in the water to drown?
1:22:38
Those things did bother me over a period of time.
1:22:40
I just couldn’t understand a group of people could do that to
1:22:47
another group of people that they didn’t have time to understand.
1:22:53
Then, to do the same thing for years, for years and that’s why my father
1:23:01
left Mississippi, for that same thing.
1:23:04
The Ku Klux Klan.
1:23:05
I don’t think I told you what happened.
1:23:08
The Ku Klux Klan was waking down, four of them on each side, dragging a
1:23:13
black, pregnant woman on the street.
1:23:18
My father was 16, high school, and when he saw this and he couldn’t believe it.
1:23:25
He asked somebody there what happened?
1:23:27
She had refused to tell them where her husband was because she
1:23:32
knew they were going to kill him.
1:23:36
They were dragging her, trying to make her tell.
1:23:39
Well, you know, those kinds of things you never forget.
1:23:42
You never forget.
1:23:44
That changed my dad’s whole attitude about even getting an education,
1:23:49
although he knew it was very important.
1:23:51
Instead of him finishing high school, he came to St. Louis and insisted,
1:23:56
after he got married, that his daughters would go to high school and college.
1:24:01
Hopefully, they’d never have to see something like that.
1:24:06
Those are some of the things that still go through my mind.
1:24:09
I don’t understand how people could be so cruel and not even know them.
1:24:15
I don’t understand
1:24:18
that.
1:24:18
What do you think about now, well, actually from what you just said how
1:24:24
do you think that then, there are many, many people now, both Black
1:24:29
and White, going to the museum.
1:24:37
This is totally speculation, but how do you think that’s going
1:24:43
to be affecting both sides?
1:24:48
Well, I think it’s an absolute asset.
1:24:53
Number one, you’ve got to know the truth.
1:24:57
What I really liked about that museum is no matter what the Black has gone
1:25:02
through all those generations, it was a lie in terms of whether they can
1:25:08
read, whether they can write, whether they can be an asset to society.
1:25:14
Because you see those kinds of things were taught to Caucasians
1:25:20
that the Black man cannot read.
1:25:22
He’s not capable.
1:25:24
Mormons taught it in their religion.
1:25:26
People taught it in their religions.
1:25:29
Yet, look what’s happened.
1:25:31
All the way through they end up with a Black President of the United States.
1:25:35
So,
1:25:37
what I’m saying is, all those were lies.
1:25:40
You still have to rise above that and keep going.
1:25:45
Tell us, I think we’re coming, obviously we can keep talking, not all day, but five
1:25:52
more years, but to kind of start to wind up as you’re probably getting tired, too.
1:26:02
When you look back in your life, what stands out the most in your memory?
1:26:07
When I look back at my life, which I’ve done several times, I
1:26:11
think the thing that stands out in my memory are several things.
1:26:14
Number one, how lucky I was to have the parents I had, because what my dad saw
1:26:21
and what my mother also has experienced, they didn’t make it, they didn’t allow
1:26:27
it to be negative in their lives.
1:26:30
They turned that around and they could see that there’s a goal
1:26:33
out there for their children.
1:26:36
It was a lot of hatred and miscommunication, and that’s hard.
1:26:42
If you experience what they’ve experienced, you can also teach hatred.
1:26:48
Some Blacks did, because it’s a matter of survival.
1:26:50
They’ve been so hurt.
1:26:53
I think that was, my sisters and I have said that over and over again.
1:26:57
We were really lucky to have the parents that we had.
1:27:01
And the people, the friends that I’ve met all along the way.
1:27:06
They’ve been very, very helpful, too.
1:27:09
There are good people out there.
1:27:11
I guess with all that I went through, and some of it I haven’t even shared.
1:27:15
Out of all it, I still feel there’s a lot of good people.
1:27:21
What would you say were the
1:27:27
very best parts of your life?
1:27:28
The very best parts of my life, was, number one, my
1:27:29
family as we were growing up.
1:27:32
We laughed and sang and had so much fun with no money [laughs] . It proved you
1:27:40
don’t have to have money to be happy.
1:27:42
You have to have perseverance.
1:27:44
You have to have a goal in life.
1:27:46
That’s so important.
1:27:47
Then work towards that goal.
1:27:49
Put your energy towards a goal that you are trying to reach.
1:27:56
Human relations is so important.
1:27:59
Friendship is important.
1:28:01
Keep the friends that you have.
1:28:02
Don’t expect them to be perfect.
1:28:05
Those are the things that kept... and be active.
1:28:09
My tennis and my ping pong, and all those things that we did, we did with
1:28:13
people that were happy, too, that could share those kinds of things.
1:28:19
Right now, in about 15 minutes I’m supposed to meet some of my
1:28:25
friends that I played tennis with.
1:28:27
Now, I’m 89.
1:28:30
I’m still having lunch with friends that I played tennis
1:28:34
that I’ve played tennis—one’s my friends and two are Caucasians.
1:28:39
We’ve been friends for 50, 60 years.
1:28:43
Those things, good things, can come out of all this.
1:28:46
Well, everything is so positive.
1:28:49
I hate to ask this question, but what about the not so good ones that stand out?
1:28:56
What are you asking me about them?
1:28:59
We were talking about the best parts in life?
1:29:02
That’s really a better place to
1:29:06
end the conversation, but I do want to think what were some of the worst?
1:29:10
You’ve probably already told some of them.
1:29:13
Yeah.
1:29:13
The worst ones, to work so hard in college and to be—I was chosen for Who’s Who.
1:29:20
I ended up being Student Body Secretary.
1:29:23
I was president of my sorority, all of this in college.
1:29:26
When I walked in that door, there was nothing but negativism.
1:29:29
I ended up with a positive.
1:29:31
In fact, I have it in my yearbook here, pictures that I
1:29:35
was very successful in college.
1:29:37
So,
1:29:39
I have to think about that.
1:29:40
I have
1:29:42
to focus on the positive.
1:29:45
If you focus so much on the negativism, you’re going to be negative all your
1:29:49
life, and all the good stuff that’s out there, you’re going to miss.
1:29:53
I think the most important thing, and I told my sons that, the most
1:29:57
important thing is education.
1:29:58
If you get an education you can do a lot of positive things with people.
1:30:05
Are
1:30:08
there any things that you would have done, when you look back, that
1:30:11
you would have done differently if you were able, do you think?
1:30:17
I would have done differently...I probably would have taken some more music
1:30:24
[laughs] . I’m so sorry I didn’t do that.
1:30:30
At this point, no.
1:30:33
I think because my parents my parents kept saying, reach your goal.
1:30:38
I had that goal focused so strongly that I don’t, at this point, no.
1:30:47
probably after we finish here things will come to me.
1:30:52
I feel I lived a good life, that I was very fortunate, because I
1:30:55
lived a good life in bad times.
1:31:00
I’m thankful that I was able to survive.
1:31:03
Thank you so much.
1:31:04
Is there anything else you feel like you would really want to tell us that
1:31:10
hasn’t come out yet from any questions or
1:31:15
you’re just...?
1:31:15
I still would like people to focus on an education with their kids.
1:31:22
Be a family with their children.
1:31:24
That to me was most, and we were poor, but we didn’t know it.
1:31:29
Because we had that piano music.
1:31:31
There is no reason why parents cannot encourage their kids to finish school
1:31:38
and to think upon a career and show them that you’re supporting them in that way.
1:31:44
That, to me, that’s what got us through, because we didn’t have any money.
1:31:49
Then, my mother, because she was such a good mother, she got recognition.
1:31:53
She got a lot of recognition.
1:31:56
Mother of the year.
1:31:59
She got some beautiful letters from Japan when she got mother of the year.
1:32:05
You see, it’s the way that you carry yourself.
1:32:10
The negativism is going to be out there no matter.
1:32:13
You’re not going to be able to eliminate it.
1:32:15
That’s just part of life.
1:32:17
You can make the best that you can out of life with positive
1:32:21
goals and work towards them.
1:32:24
I really believe that.
1:32:25
All my sisters did the same thing.
1:32:28
We all married, all have children, and we all look positive.
1:32:33
We all love music.
1:32:36
I think music is fundamental.
1:32:38
Music and sports will get you through anything.
1:32:42
Well, thank you so much for your time and this wonderful information.
1:32:48
It’s inspiring just to hear you talk.
1:32:51
Oh, bless your heart.
1:32:52
... and to tell about your life, and I think you’re amazing.
1:32:56
If
1:32:59
I could be like you when I’m 89 years old, I’ll be happy.
1:33:04
You can be better than me.
1:33:07
I don’t know.
1:33:10
This has just been any wonderful.
1:33:11
Do you have any questions or anything you want to ask us?
1:33:15
No.
1:33:15
I think you’re doing a great job.
1:33:17
When will I see some of this information done?
1:33:24
That’s going to be a long way down the line.
1:33:26
Now, what do you mean by long way?
1:33:30
Will I still be alive?
1:33:33
It looks to me like you’ll live until at least 120, so...
1:33:37
My mother lived to be 100.
1:33:39
Well, you’re on the way.
1:33:41
We didn’t know how long she would have lived, because she was
1:33:44
killed in an automobile accident.
1:33:46
We have no idea.
1:33:50
She was, we took her, for her 100th birthday we took her to Bonneville Dam,
1:33:57
not Bonneville Dam... yeah, on a ship.
1:34:01
See, [laughs] I forget sometimes.
1:34:04
On one of those cruises?
1:34:06
Yeah, uh-huh.
1:34:10
Anyway, she was still walking.
1:34:13
Happy.
1:34:15
Had all her senses.
1:34:17
We got on the ship.
1:34:18
We announced that we had our mother there.
1:34:21
The man asked her how old she was.
1:34:22
We said, 100.
1:34:24
He says, 100!
1:34:25
We took her into the dinner, and he announced it: we have a lady here
1:34:30
on the ship that’s 100 years old.
1:34:32
She just smiled.
1:34:34
They said, she doesn’t look it!
1:34:36
They couldn’t believe it.
1:34:37
But we don’t know how old she would have lived had she not been
1:34:41
hit in an automobile accident.
1:34:43
The man didn’t stop in a stoplight.
1:34:46
He went right into their car and demolished it.
1:34:51
We rushed her to the hospital.
1:34:53
All my sisters were there.
1:34:55
we stayed the 4 or 5 days she was in the hospital.
1:34:59
She was there laughing, telling us all crazy jokes.
1:35:04
We just knew she was going to come out.
1:35:06
The doctor came in one day and said, Mrs. Brock, how are you doing?
1:35:10
He just yelled it at her.
1:35:11
She said, I would do better if you wouldn’t yell at me.
1:35:15
I’m not deaf.
1:35:16
We all fell out laughing.
1:35:19
But she was so up in the hospital, we just knew she was coming home.
1:35:24
Bev and I had gone to lunch, and the nurse said, may I speak to you two girls.
1:35:31
We said, yes.
1:35:33
She said, I need to tell you, your mother’s dying.
1:35:36
We just didn’t believe her.
1:35:38
She said, yes, all her vitals are closing down on her.
1:35:43
We still couldn’t believe it, because she was still up and
1:35:46
laughing making us all laugh.
1:35:48
When the nurse left, we looked at each other, she doesn’t
1:35:50
know what she’s talking about.
1:35:53
Mother lasted one more day, she went in a coma and passed away.
1:35:56
The woman told us the truth.
1:35:58
You know, I’m sort of glad she did tell us.
1:36:00
Then, when it did happen to her, it wasn’t a shock.
1:36:03
We were just assuming we were going to take her back home with us
1:36:09
and everything.
1:36:10
Well, you were asking, it’s a long process, because basically
1:36:19
what we’re talking about having this fancy camera, we need a lot
1:36:27
more technology to be able to get this, what we’ve recorded, into a form that
1:36:36
then will eventually, it’s all digitized.
1:36:42
For the virtual museum,
1:36:46
setting that up is very complex.
1:36:50
We’re still working to get partners to work with us who have
1:36:59
all the technology we need so that we can have something permanent.
1:37:03
For that to happen is that eventually you’re going to go online and you’re
1:37:11
going to type in “Oregon Black Pioneers Virtual Museum.” It’s going
1:37:18
to be catalogued, and there will be
1:37:22
interviews that are just what you can call “raw data,” just nothing analyzed,
1:37:30
just straight what you just told me.
1:37:33
Then that would make it possible for researchers, or anyone, to look at
1:37:39
as many of these and do their own historical analysis or whatever.
1:37:44
Some of them what we want to be able to do is make separate videos,
1:37:51
so we’re interviewing several people, we get different themes.
1:37:55
One theme that’s coming out already is the strength of that
1:38:01
belief in the need for education.
1:38:05
I’m listening to different people.
1:38:06
That’s getting repeated.
1:38:08
There’s another part, too, that positive attitude, keeping some... so, eventually,
1:38:18
we want to work to have separate little, short videos that would pick out a theme.
1:38:31
Then, people can access this and they can set up their own exhibits
1:38:37
within libraries, within schools,
1:38:43
within any kind of community situation.
1:38:46
It’s going to provide historical data for academics, for historians, for anyone and
1:38:53
also a means for communities to set up their own little educational programs.
1:39:02
That’s good.
1:39:04
It’s a process.
1:39:10
Well, having gone to the Black museum in Washington, D.C., I see a need for
1:39:16
this, because it’s education that’s right there, that you just access.
1:39:25
Its worthwhile going back and checking.
1:39:28
I’m ready to go back to the one in Washington, D.C., again.
1:39:31
There’s so much there that I didn’t even know about, the history.
1:39:39
It’s educational.
1:39:41
Well, and the point is, that people don’t know about Oregon.
1:39:46
Actually, who was it?
1:39:47
I think it was Martha Rutherford who pointed out to me, I think it was
1:39:52
her, that she noted they didn’t have anything about Oregon in the museum.
1:39:58
It
1:40:01
was like—
1:40:02
You mean the one here?
1:40:04
No.
1:40:05
I mean in Washington.
1:40:06
In Washington, D.C.?
1:40:09
No.
1:40:10
I didn’t see anything about Oregon, but they had enough information there that you
1:40:17
can also say that part of that’s Oregon.
1:40:18
So, that’s part of
1:40:21
the whole idea here, is to get the history of African Americans in Oregon.
1:40:28
So, Oregonians... you know, they don’t know, they don’t know about the history...
1:40:37
I know.
1:40:38
...of African Americans here.
1:40:39
You’re right.
1:40:40
You know, all the segregation, discrimination
1:40:43
we experienced in high school.
1:40:46
My college never knew it.
1:40:47
My White friends that I met, they never knew it.
1:40:50
When they would have something at Jantzen Beach, we couldn’t go.
1:40:56
It was... yet, no one at Jefferson High School even took a, to our
1:41:01
knowledge, took time to find out why the Blacks weren’t participate in those.
1:41:06
We couldn’t go.
1:41:07
They had skating rinks parties, and we couldn’t go.
1:41:12
Even if they knew, I don’t think they’d do anything about it, at that time.
1:41:18
Well, I grew up in Washington, D.C., during the time of segregation and
1:41:25
when integration of the schools was in 1954, I was in fifth grade.
1:41:35
Yeah.
1:41:36
I was in fifth grade, because my fifth grade teacher, her name was Mrs.
1:41:43
Wishesson, warned us that what was going to happen was that the negroes were going
1:41:53
to be coming into our schools, and if that happened she was going to quiet.
1:41:58
Yeah, that attitude.
1:41:59
She’s telling the children that.
1:42:03
Well, when I was growing up, all our history was all about the south.
1:42:11
Nobody ever told us about African Americans that were pioneers that went out
1:42:18
west and were part of the western history.
1:42:21
They didn’t tell us.
1:42:23
No.
1:42:23
It’s always negative.
1:42:25
It was all, everything was just south.
1:42:28
Even New England was great.
1:42:31
That’s no problem.
1:42:32
It was just the south.
1:42:33
This
1:42:36
type of...
1:42:37
Yeah.
1:42:38
What you’re really saying is it was taught.
1:42:41
Segregation, discrimination was taught, not only through the
1:42:43
religions but through education, through socialization, everything.
1:42:49
All that was taught.
1:42:51
It’s still being taught with your president.
1:42:56
Okay.
1:42:57
Maybe we should stop [laughs]
1:42:59
[laughs]
1:43:02
I had to get that in there.
1:43:03
I’m sorry.
1:43:04
That man’s just driving me crazy.
1:43:05
I have to say don’t says it’s “my” president.
1:43:08
I know.
1:43:09
Everybody tells me that.
1:43:10
I said, I can’t claim him at all.
1:43:12
I had to put him on somebody.
1:43:15
Not me!
1:43:16
Oh, my God.
1:43:18
I know.
