00:00
Okay, well good morning.
00:03
Good morning.
00:05
I think you probably know mainly what the purpose of the interview is, that
00:09
we’re taking these life histories of people that have lived here for a
00:13
long time so that we can get a good historical record of the experiences
00:20
of African Americans living in Oregon.
00:23
Yes.
00:24
We’ll
00:26
just start with the beginning of your life.
00:29
Can you give us some idea, a little history of your childhood?
00:34
Where you were born?
00:37
Where you lived?
00:39
Kind of just start from the beginning of what you do remember.
00:42
What I do remember [laughs] . Well, I may not remember all of this, but I
00:46
have looked it up, or I’ve been told.
00:50
I was born here in Portland, Portland, Oregon.
00:53
I was born at Emanuel Hospital in 1931, June 29th.
01:00
At that time, my parents, my mother and father and my brother, my older
01:05
brother who is 1 year, 1 month, and 1 day older than I am, we were living in
01:11
a very small house off of Peninsular Avenue in I guess the area of Kenton,
01:21
Portland, the neighborhood of Kenton.
01:23
My mother always called it St. Johns, but it really wasn’t St. Johns.
01:28
Our last name was Emanuel.
01:30
My dad’s name was Norman Emanuel and I was born in the Emanuel Hospital.
01:36
So, it seems like I should have gotten something out of that, but I didn’t.
01:42
I grew up in that neighborhood until—I went through first and second grade there.
01:50
Then our school burned down.
01:52
I think the school must have burned down when I was in first grade.
01:56
Second grade, we had a choice of going to Woodlawn School by bus.
02:03
We would have been the first bussed students, or we could
02:07
walk to Portsmouth School.
02:11
Here I am, a second grader, going on the bus or walking to school.
02:16
Well, we did take the bus, my brother and I, who is 1 year
02:18
older, took the bus to Woodlawn
02:24
and my brother, that first day, missed the bus coming home.
02:29
My mom said, enough of that.
02:33
We were only bussed for one day, and then after that we walked to Portsmouth.
02:40
That was quite a walk, now as I look back at it.
02:43
You know, kids don’t care.
02:44
They’re just skipping along.
02:48
I spent one year at Portsmouth School, second grade.
02:52
By third grade, we moved to the area where I now live, which is Lents in Portland.
02:59
Quite a move, but my folks were able to get a house with
03:06
3 bedrooms and a kitchen, dining room, living room, which was much bigger
03:10
than the house we lived in Kenton area.
03:15
So, we lived in Lents area.
03:19
At that time Lents was very undeveloped.
03:23
We lived near, across the street was a wooded area that was just jungle:
03:30
blackberry vines and bushes and things for kids to run through and hide and catch
03:38
snakes and things, oh goodness, like that.
03:43
Only four houses.
03:44
I think four houses at that time were on the block, maybe 5 houses.
03:48
The street was not paved, did not go through.
03:52
We skipped up and down and had a lot of fun.
03:56
The lot next to my folks’ house was filled with blackberries and just a jungle.
04:06
My folks fenced that lot in and they had chickens.
04:11
Then our big project my brother and I had was to take care of the chickens.
04:18
We loved chickens, but when they were baby chicks.
04:21
We didn’t like them after they got to be grown.
04:24
They were kind of mean, actually.
04:27
Anyway, that’s where we grew up.
04:30
[Break in recording]
04:31
You were talking about taking care of the grown chickens, as opposed to the chicks.
04:36
Right.
04:36
We loved baby chicks, and we had names for them and had a lot of fun with them.
04:42
Then, they grow up and they go out and they’re kind of mean sometimes.
04:49
We really didn’t like, my brother and I did not like having to take care of
04:53
the chickens, but that’s what we did.
04:56
We walked a block and a half to the old Lents School, which was one of the
05:02
last almost 3-story wooden buildings in existence still in the city.
05:13
Came home for lunch every day.
05:14
Mom insisted that we go to school and come home for lunch every day.
05:21
That’s how we grew up through, I was third grade, my brother was
05:25
fourth grade, through eighth grade.
05:29
After that, we went to Franklin High School.
05:33
It’s kind of an interesting thing, a little factor: when my brother was,
05:39
well he would have been first and second grade, he somehow ran into a neighbor kid.
05:49
I remember his name, but the neighbor kid was kind of bigger.
05:55
Actually, I don’t know where the kid lived but he was in our neighborhood,
05:58
and he always picked on my brother.
06:01
My brother was very gentle.
06:03
He wasn’t like me.
06:04
He wasn’t mean and hostile [laughs] . He’d always want to fight with my brother, and
06:10
Brother never really enjoyed fighting.
06:13
When we moved down here to Lents, who should we encounter but this same
06:18
individual, who was, I think, a year, maybe, or two older than my brother,
06:22
always wanted to fight with him.
06:25
I remember one time coming home, my brother and I always walked together and
06:29
came home together, generally speaking.
06:34
Well, I came running home because on the way home this character, this young man,
06:42
accosted my brother and wanted to fight.
06:45
So, I run home and tell my mother: Milton’s fighting!
06:51
Milton’s fighting!
06:52
And she asked me, what are you doing here?
06:54
You better go back and help him [laughs] . I had to turn around
06:58
and go back a block or two.
07:01
I don’t know what I did, but I remember going back and probably
07:04
hollering and screamed and made a lot of noise and brought a crowd
07:07
so that it stopped the fight.
07:10
We got along.
07:12
My brother was a very gentle person.
07:15
As I say, he didn’t pick fights or anything like that,
07:20
because he was very creative.
07:22
He was very artistic, and music, he had a beautiful voice.
07:27
We had taken piano lessons, but we really, neither one of us, played very well,
07:31
but we had taken piano lessons from... I think we had a WPA piano teacher.
07:37
She might have known, but she was not a very good teacher.
07:40
Anyway, we did learn to play piano.
07:46
In our grade school, it was kind of interesting because I don’t’
07:52
remember at Peninsula, because I think I was too young, I don’t
07:55
remember if there were any Black kids.
07:58
The only family I knew that was not Caucasian, White, was, we had a family
08:09
of Native Americans at that, for some reason we had befriended, and the mother,
08:18
I think there were 4 or 5 children.
08:21
Of course that was the time when nobody had any money.
08:24
Nobody had any, you know, means of anything, but you
08:28
just did the best you could.
08:30
Mom was very generous with food, and she loved to cook and we could, she could
08:39
prepare food out of a little bit of nothing that would serve the multitude.
08:44
What kind of food?
08:45
Just anything.
08:46
She was from Barbados.
08:50
She was very basic: rice and beans and a lot of vegetables.
08:57
We had our own garden.
08:59
We grew corn and beets and tomatoes and lettuce and cabbage.
09:05
Just everything.
09:08
She was very, I don’t know what you’d call it, just creative with food and
09:16
she was very generous with sharing food, so I remember we always shared
09:20
food every time the family, the Native American kids, I think there were about
09:27
5 of them.
09:27
If they’d come with their mother, it was interesting to watch because
09:32
she was very strict with them and she’d have them sit and they’d fold
09:35
their hands and they wouldn’t move.
09:37
They had to answer in a complete sentence, like we had to answer
09:43
in a complete sentence, too.
09:47
Even though you didn’t have very much, you really didn’t suffer.
09:53
We didn’t want for anything that you really needed.
09:57
There were no frills.
10:02
When we moved out here from North Portland,
10:09
I was 8, 7 or 8, and we started picking berries in the summertime.
10:17
Somehow we had a connection, my dad had a connection with a gentleman
10:20
who had a farm in the Gresham area.
10:24
Every summer, we would go picking berries.
10:28
Well, that’s what most of the kids our age did at that time.
10:31
By then, you were how old?
10:34
Eight, Nine, Ten.
10:35
As I was thinking the other day, I think I picked berries
10:40
until I went into high school.
10:41
Of course, that was not cool then to be picking berries if you didn’t
10:45
have to, but I’m sure we might have picked berries for a few years.
10:50
You’d start with the strawberries and then you’d go into raspberries and then there
10:55
were Logan berries and then blackberries.
11:00
A lot of kids in our neighborhood also picked beans.
11:02
My brother and I never got into bean picking.
11:04
I don’t know why, it was just a different activity, I guess, and I know that a
11:10
lot of our neighbor kids would take a bus that would pick up in the Lents
11:16
area and drive out to the bean fields.
11:18
We went with Mom.
11:20
That was serious berry picking.
11:23
No throwing berries.
11:25
Now, you could eat with as many as you could get away with, but there
11:29
was no playing in the field because you were there to make money.
11:35
That was a very serious thing.
11:36
I was talking to somebody about that the other day.
11:38
We drove out to Gresham.
11:40
She went to pick up some plants for her garden and for her, what do you call it?
11:51
Oh, plants for her pond, I guess, and she went to this special place.
11:55
I said, I remember this area.
11:56
This was the area where we picked berries from the time I was like 8 until 12 or so.
12:05
That’s how we spent our summer.
12:08
I never felt persecuted or put upon.
12:11
It was just what we did.
12:14
We were grateful to have the money that we were allowed to keep.
12:19
If you wanted anything extra, like when you get into high
12:22
school and you want to buy your yearbook or your other things that
12:30
high school kids think they have to have, I wouldn’t have had them
12:34
if we hadn’t pick berries, because berry money was what I had to spend.
12:39
How did your mother divide up the money?
12:43
Do you know?
12:45
If I remember correctly, the money we made was ours, pretty much.
12:51
So, according to how much berries you picked, you had your own buckets.
12:55
Oh, yes.
12:55
We had our own buckets and you were responsible for them.
13:00
You did the requirements, like you don’t put green, you knew what
13:05
you were supposed to put in there.
13:07
it was not playing around.
13:08
Mom was serious about it.
13:11
When she said that’s what you’ll do, that is exactly what you did.
13:18
That’s the way we were raised.
13:22
Everybody in, when we first moved out here, okay we’re on 96th Street, and
13:27
if I’m not mistaken, 97th Street was
13:34
the boundary of the city at that time.
13:37
We were one block
13:40
within the city.
13:41
The people on 97th Street, there were two families and they each,
13:46
each one of those families had a cow.
13:50
We got milk from the Wilsons on one week.
13:55
The next week we’d get milk from the family, I’ve forgotten the name now.
14:05
Those two families, they lived right across the street from each
14:08
other and they each had a cow.
14:10
Because the neighborhood wasn’t, there was not a lot of housing on our street,
14:16
but there were 5 houses on their street.
14:18
There might have been about 3 or 4 houses.
14:20
That was the boundary of the city at that time.
14:23
Outside of that boundary they could put their cows and stake their cows out to
14:29
you know just eat grass out in the field.
14:32
You remember a lot of things that, there were a lot of woods around and
14:39
places for kids to run and hide, chase each other, and that kind of stuff.
14:45
Were the neighbors, the people around, were they African Americans?
14:51
There were no African Americans that we knew of in the Lents neighborhood,
15:00
except there was a man that everybody called Long Tom, I believe.
15:06
We found out later, he was a tall, very tall, imposing Black gentleman.
15:13
We found out later that he lived
15:18
in the Mount Scott area, which at that time was so rustic and rural that if
15:27
you went up there you would find the caves that were there that they indicate
15:34
that Native Americans had lived there.
15:38
That’s now where a lot of the cemeteries are located.
15:43
It was all very rustic.
15:46
As I say, our street was not paved.
15:48
97th Street was not paved.
15:53
It was just kind of a wild area.
15:55
You’d see,
15:59
what are the birds which
16:02
we no longer see anymore that fly in the morning?
16:07
Oh, shoot, I can’t think of the name of it now, but we always heard those birds
16:12
flying up out of the fields every morning.
16:19
A lot of that has gone now, now that housing has come in.
16:26
The city limits, of course, have expanded from 97th to at least a hundred.
16:33
I don’t know how far.
16:35
How did you get along with the neighbors?
16:39
We got along fine, my brother and I. As I say, my mother being from
16:43
Barbados, she came here as, she was still in high school when she came here.
16:49
She came to join her mother and father who were from Barbados, and
16:55
apparently her mom and dad had left Barbados to work on the Panama Canal.
17:04
There was a lot of people from the islands were.
17:07
How they got from working on the canal to Portland, I do not know.
17:14
I wish to goodness I did.
17:17
I know that they came first to San Francisco, but why they came from
17:24
San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, is a mystery to me, but they did.
17:29
But they left their children all in Barbados, who were
17:34
being raised by grandparents.
17:36
Well, my mother said that when she got to be about 15 or 16, she wanted
17:43
to come to the United States to be with her parents, who had been here
17:49
for several years at that time.
17:52
She was only 16.
17:55
So, she was still in high school.
17:58
She had a younger brother who was, I think, 8 and a
18:02
younger sister who was like 12.
18:05
She put her age up to 18 so she could be responsible for her younger
18:10
siblings and she brought them up.
18:13
Well, they came through
18:16
the, what’s the gateway in New York.
18:22
By train they came to Oregon.
18:27
It turns out that a guy who was working on the train, which is what a lot of
18:30
Black people, Black men, did in those days and probably still do to some extent,
18:39
he knew their parents and when he was told that their kids were coming,
18:45
these three children, Mom was 16 and a 12-year-old and an 8-year-old, this
18:51
guy took care of them on the train.
18:53
My mom was, she said she was frightened to death.
18:57
She was afraid of everything.
18:59
She did not recognize food items and she was afraid that she was being given,
19:06
if it was bologna, she had never seen processed meat like that, and she thought
19:10
that was something she shouldn’t eat.
19:14
Anyway, they made it from New York to Oregon.
19:19
Mom said
19:23
that she didn’t know a lot about name-calling and racism, and my
19:31
dad had come to Oregon from, he was born in Georgia and he graduated
19:40
high school in Kansas City, Kansas.
19:44
I don’t know how that happened.
19:45
He went to San Francisco as a young man because he wanted to sing.
19:51
He wanted to take lessons at the opera or something in San Francisco, but he was not
19:58
allowed to do that because of his color.
20:01
So, how he got to Portland, Oregon, I’m not quite sure, except that I
20:06
know he worked and he worked at like a sheep ranch or something in Idaho.
20:15
When he was there, he met the man who became my grandfather, because he married
20:23
my grandmother, but my dad met August Lopez, who had come from California and
20:32
they met at this sheep ranch in Idaho.
20:37
August Lopez, somehow had property or bought property, in Vancouver,
20:44
Washington, in Orchards, Washington.
20:48
He persuaded my dad to come with him and work on this property.
20:57
He was going to have a chicken.
20:59
He persuaded my dad to work with him.
21:02
My dad was a young man and my dad then introduced August Lopez
21:09
to his mother who was working in Salt Lake City as a seamstress.
21:18
When they met, they got married and then they started a chicken
21:23
ranch in Orchards, Washington.
21:25
Now I have a stepdad and then my dad who’d come from working in Idaho.
21:32
When he came to Portland, he met my mother when he was selling eggs
21:40
and chickens along Williams Avenue to more predominantly Black people,
21:47
and that’s how he met my mother.
21:49
Then they became married.
21:51
Well, so, my dad comes from the south, but for some reason he, I don’t know, he was
22:01
not, I don’t think I ever heard him talk about being, maybe he just didn’t talk
22:08
about it, being traumatized or abused or mistreated other than being not allowed to
22:17
do things, like he wasn’t allowed to join the opera or whatever in San Francisco.
22:23
But Mom, coming from Barbados, first of all, she said she had never heard the
22:28
word nigger until she came to Portland.
22:32
That’s interesting because apparently, so she didn’t have any
22:41
bad feelings about people who were not Black.
22:45
People were just people.
22:48
My grandmother from Salt Lake City,
22:53
although they were originally from Georgia, but they weren’t
22:57
burdened with hostility and hatred.
23:00
My brother and I grew up, thinking what’s the problem?
23:07
Okay, you’re White.
23:09
I’m Black.
23:12
I don’t have a problem.
23:13
What’s your problem?
23:16
Really, if you’re taught that way, it’s hard to be hateful.
23:22
My mother would always tell us, my mom and grandma, grandfather,
23:27
grandmother especially, she would just lecture us about you are, you
23:35
know, you’re one of God’s people.
23:38
You’re intelligent.
23:39
You have good sense.
23:40
You don’t need to feel bad about yourself.
23:45
We looked at people as people.
23:46
We didn’t say they’re White.
23:47
We’re Black.
23:48
It wasn’t a big issue.
23:52
I was the only Black person in my class all through grade school.
23:56
My brother, I think, was the only Black person in his class
24:01
all through grade school.
24:03
Then in my high school class I think I was the only Black person.
24:07
You know, you just, eh.
24:10
As far as the other children were concerned, did they just
24:14
accept you as another person?
24:15
Well, probably not.
24:17
Because, like I said, this boy who followed us we met when we came out here.
24:24
He, evidently, had a problem with color, and he wanted to fight my brother.
24:29
My brother was just not a fighting person.
24:31
I can’t imagine why anybody would want to fight with him.
24:39
You can’t fight with somebody if they won’t fight and they
24:42
just, you know, like go away.
24:44
Leave me alone.
24:45
My
24:47
parents and my grandparents always said, you know, you don’t
24:50
have, it isn’t about fighting.
24:52
You’re not a fighter.
24:54
You should love people.
24:57
God loves you, and you should love people, that kind of thing.
25:02
We just learned if somebody called you nigger, you just
25:06
like, well, they got a problem.
25:07
I’m not going to be bothered with it.
25:12
When you hear that enough, it’s serious.
25:16
You don’t care.
25:17
It’s their problem, not yours.
25:19
Don’t assume it.
25:21
My grandmother was kind of a crazy lady.
25:23
She had a notebook, and she took it everywhere she went and she
25:29
would set up situations just to see how people would react, so she
25:32
could record it in her notebook.
25:35
I wish to goodness I could have acquired that notebook when she died,
25:40
and I don’t know what happened to it.
25:42
Did she tell any stories from it?
25:44
She would tell this story about in Orchards, Washington,
25:48
then, that would have been in
25:52
the ‘30s, there was one big grocery store down on Fourth Plain Boulevard,
25:58
and everybody had to go there to shop.
26:01
When they would bring in the load of watermelons from Hermiston, Washington,
26:06
or something, she’s this big Black lady, and my quiet, reserved grandfather, who
26:14
would, I think when he got to the store he disappeared quickly because he knew
26:18
Grandma was going to set up something.
26:21
Anyway, she’d see this pile of watermelons stacked outside, you know.
26:26
She would call him.
26:28
She’d say, August!
26:29
August!
26:30
August!
26:30
Come here!
26:32
Come here August!
26:32
See all these watermelons!
26:34
We got to eat all these watermelons, August!
26:37
He’s like, oh my goodness what’s she doing now?
26:40
Then, she’d take out her notebook and she’d write what reactions she got.
26:46
You know?
26:47
She’d do things like that.
26:49
Grandma Lopez was loved by everybody.
26:52
She loved to cook.
26:53
She loved to have people come over, and the next door neighbor they’re all White.
26:58
She just, it just didn’t matter to her.
27:02
That’s how my brother and I grew up.
27:05
Eh.
27:06
Not my problem.
27:07
What kind of food did your grandmother cook?
27:10
Grandma?
27:10
Grandma cooked just plain southern fried chicken and rice and corn.
27:17
Of course, Grandpa had 12 acres of that at that time.
27:21
He planted every kind of vegetable you could imagine.
27:25
In the ‘30s there were a lot of people who needed food, and he would provide
27:31
food and he’d take his little truck and he’d drive down into Portland
27:36
or wherever and just pass out food.
27:41
Sell it or pass it out?
27:44
Pass it out.
27:44
Right.
27:44
No he did not sell it.
27:46
He did grow peonies in one part of his yard, and he sold those to the
27:54
florists in Vancouver, Washington.
27:57
But he was a masonry worker or something like that.
28:03
That was his other job plus this big farm that he had.
28:07
What about your mother?
28:08
Did she work other than?
28:09
Mother did, I think when she came first, before she got married, I
28:15
think she was a housekeeper, which is the job that Black ladies had.
28:21
But she didn’t work when we were young.
28:24
I think she might have worked for a short time at some cannery for a
28:30
very short time, but not very long.
28:34
Okay, now let’s keep going.
28:37
So, I think we got you up to high school.
28:39
We’re at high school.
28:42
What were some of your experiences in high school?
28:46
Well, I was telling somebody a couple days ago, I don’t know what brought it up, but
28:53
I was raised a Seventh Day Adventist.
28:55
First of all, that cut out a lot of contacts with people, because we didn’t
29:00
go to movies, and my dad might have snuck us off to a movie or two that Mom didn’t
29:06
know about because Mom was raised, she had come from Church of England when
29:13
she was in Barbados, but when she came to the United States, she did not want
29:16
anything to do with Church of England.
29:18
She became Adventist because of her connection with my grandmother Lopez.
29:26
Her mother, my mother’s mother, and father were instrumental in setting up the
29:36
church which is still existing, which I can’t think of.
29:40
It was episcopal in downtown Portland.
29:46
But Mom never went to, she just abandoned that, and for some
29:50
reason she got into the Adventist.
29:52
Well, then she was really strict.
29:53
We didn’t do this.
29:54
You didn’t do that, and you didn’t go to movies.
29:57
You couldn’t wear makeup and this that and the other.
30:01
Since my brother and I never went to movies when we were young, I
30:04
didn’t know anything about movies.
30:06
Well, this experience I had in high school, this, I’m sure this guy was a
30:13
senior, this White guy, and he would always run by my locker and when he, he
30:22
never touched me or anything, but he’d always stop by my locker and he’d say...
30:27
oh, what’s the Little Rascals girl?
30:30
Anyway, whatever her name was?
30:33
See, since I didn’t go to movies, I can never remember it.
30:36
He’d call me, oh, shoot.
30:40
I can’t think of the name of—do you know the Little Rascals?
30:42
There were two groups of little kids that were on radio and then
30:52
TV when TV came into existence.
30:56
There were 2, 3 Black kids.
30:58
They were little ragamuffin kids.
31:01
He’d always call me, oh shoot--
31:07
Buckwheat?
31:08
Buckwheat, or something like, yeah, you know.
31:11
He’d run by my locker and he’d tap me on the shoulder, and he’d
31:13
call me Buckwheat or something.
31:15
I’d just look at him and start laughing.
31:17
I didn’t know what he was talking about.
31:19
He thought he was hurting my feelings.
31:20
It wasn’t even coming close to my feelings, because I
31:24
didn’t know what it was.
31:26
Even if I did know, I’m sure it wouldn’t have bothered me.
31:29
It’s just not my problem, you know?
31:37
As a freshman, I remember one experience I had.
31:40
It took me a while to figure out what was going on.
31:44
When freshman girls, they got an assignment, kind of a set up, so
31:52
you had a senior boy assigned to you the first day that after they do
31:59
the introductory things and you go and they show you around the school.
32:05
Then, they assigned you a senior boy to be with each freshman girl.
32:11
So, the freshman guys seemed like they were all seated in some kind of order and
32:17
then the freshman girls would come up.
32:21
They had your name, and the senior guys had your name, and they were
32:27
supposed to greet you and then they were going to take you around the
32:31
school and then you were going to go have refreshments in the cafeteria.
32:36
I don’t know what else we were supposed to do that day.
32:38
Well, I was with my real good friend,
32:44
who I just, she just died a little while ago, a month or so ago, and I was
32:48
really disappointed, but we had been really tight friends since third grade.
32:54
We were together, and we walked up.
32:58
So, I guess you have a name tag or something.
33:03
This one senior guy said to her, Darlene, oh, I’m your senior guy.
33:07
There
33:09
was a guy sitting next to him, who was sitting kind of with his
33:13
head down and kind of slumped
33:20
in the chair [laughs] . He didn’t say anything.
33:24
So, we were like the last two, and so nobody was going to greet me and
33:30
Darlene didn’t, I guess she didn’t know what to do, so her senior guy
33:34
said, oh, well come on let’s go.
33:36
She said, well, Aletha you’re just coming with me.
33:40
So, I went with her.
33:41
I went on down to the cafeteria and had cookies and punch, or whatever it was.
33:48
So, this other little quiet guy, he kind of came along, too, but he never
33:57
acknowledged that he was with me or that I was supposed to be with him.
34:03
I’m like, oh.
34:05
I didn’t think about.
34:07
I was like, well, he’s kind of a, I wonder why he’s going, you know?
34:12
Darlene said, well, whatever I’m doing, you’re doing with me.
34:17
So, that’s how that went.
34:20
I thought back to a seventh grade experience that I had
34:27
where first I missed school for a whole day to get glasses.
34:34
My mom took me downtown to get glasses, and so when I came home, Mom and I
34:38
came home, and on our porch we had about 5 or 6 of my classmates, girls.
34:47
They were upset.
34:50
They said that the seventh grade teacher, I wasn’t there, that whole
34:55
day, told them that Black people, they didn’t say Black then: Negroes.
35:01
Darkies, I guess you said,
35:05
they were ignorant.
35:06
They came from monkeys.
35:08
They can’t learn.
35:10
I don’t know what all she said, but they had a list of things.
35:15
They were, there were about 5 of them.
35:17
They were so upset.
35:19
They didn’t know what to do.
35:21
They wanted my mother to know that this had happened so
35:24
that something could be done.
35:26
I truly don’t know what—I know my mother was a very calm person, probably
35:32
went to the school and very calmly told them to do something with that
35:35
teacher because you better not say those things again, that’s not true.
35:39
My girlfriends were, you know, they were just incensed.
35:46
They were like, I thought they need—I thought that was a good teacher.
35:49
She’s not a good teacher.
35:51
She needs to go.
35:52
We don’t want her.
35:53
Well, she wasn’t there the next year, of course, but I don’t really know
35:58
what action was taken, but that was one experience that I don’t remember
36:06
feeling bad about it, except feeling that I thought that was a nice teacher.
36:11
I never had any experience with her that let me know that she
36:18
was hostile or evil or stupid.
36:21
But,
36:24
my friends they were going to make sure that somebody knew because they knew that
36:29
both my brother and I were not stupid.
36:32
We were outstanding students.
36:37
They just thought it was horrible.
36:38
It’s really interesting, because I never suspected anything with that teacher.
36:43
I never felt she treated me any differently that I was—but I was
36:48
such a giggler and so silly all the time, that if she was doing something
36:52
I probably didn’t even know it.
36:55
You’re wasting your time, woman, because I’m not getting it.
37:00
That’s kind of the way we grew up, without getting all shook up or hurt.
37:06
You’re wasting your time trying to hurt me, because I have
37:08
sense enough not to get hurt.
37:13
Then, as you finish high school?
37:17
Finished high school.
37:19
My brother was a year ahead of me.
37:21
He had already started at Vanport Junior College.
37:27
Naturally, I’m going to follow Brother to junior college.
37:30
By that time, he had already had a name for himself, because he was a very
37:35
quiet, not assuming, not a show off or anything, but he played football.
37:41
He played in the band.
37:43
He played about 3 instruments.
37:45
He had a beautiful voice, so he sang all throughout high school
37:49
and started thinking at Vanport.
37:52
He was well-known, and he was a terrific artist.
37:58
Everybody wanted to copy all of his diagrams for the science
38:01
projects, because they were perfect.
38:05
He just would draw, you know, just he was marvelous.
38:10
His eighth grade artwork went into a display around the country
38:16
and never came back to us, so we never got it back, but anyway.
38:19
He had a lot of skills, and he was just a quiet, unassuming, guy.
38:25
Of course, I was a little bit loud and obnoxious most of the time.
38:31
Followed him to Vanport College.
38:34
I got into the choir and started.
38:37
Vanport
38:39
at that time was a lot of military men, maybe women, too.
38:46
That would have been what year?
38:48
Okay, ’49 I graduated from high school.
38:52
So, ’49—’50 I went into Vanport.
38:56
That’s how the school kind of got started with military, as a place for
39:02
young men who had gone to, not Korea.
39:06
Yeah, maybe Korea.
39:08
Was Korea before Vietnam?
39:10
Yeah.
39:10
Yes.
39:12
As they came back they were given, that school developed.
39:18
It was on the administration building, or land, the building
39:20
of the administration for
39:32
the shipyard was what was the
39:38
college site.
39:40
That
39:42
was before the flood?
39:45
No, it was after the flood.
39:46
After the flood.
39:47
But the shipyard was not the flood.
39:52
The shipyard was not flooded area.
39:55
Vanport
39:58
was on the other side of where the shipyard was, kind of a strange thing.
40:05
They chose land for Vanport construction that was not good.
40:13
Should not be used because it was a floodplain.
40:21
When Kaiser wanted to build housing for shipyard workers, the city
40:27
wouldn’t provide any other land for him to build the housing.
40:36
There was a levy, a dike, and they said, oh it’s safe.
40:40
It’s safe.
40:40
It’s safe, but it wasn’t, because it was at almost he confluence of
40:46
the Willamette and the Columbia.
40:49
But where the Vanport
40:55
College was built was higher.
40:59
It would have been like a little bit east
41:05
of St. Johns area, housing area.
41:08
It was a big, open area that they had used for the administration, for the shipyard,
41:14
which was part of the Willamette area.
41:17
Anyway, so I went there 2 years.
41:23
At Vanport, then, you did have a mixture of people, and you had
41:28
people from like Jefferson High School, Roosevelt, who were Black
41:33
who started going to Vanport College.
41:37
You had quite a mixture of ethnic and racial people there.
41:43
So, people I think got along.
41:45
You’d run into something every now and then, but I grew up
41:48
thinking it ain’t my problem.
41:50
You got a problem, you just deal with it.
41:52
Not mine.
41:55
I remember all I did every noon was dance, because that’s when the swing
42:00
came in, and I just loved to dance.
42:03
All noon I was on the floor dancing.
42:06
I went two years to Vanport and
42:12
then
42:15
I could have probably stayed and taken another few classes, because
42:18
my brother stayed 3 years at Vanport, but I got a chance to go to Salem
42:26
for a job.
42:28
A friend there who had been at
42:33
Vanport College said they’re hiring people at Fairview Home.
42:38
Well, I didn’t know anything about Fairview Home, but I said, well, I need
42:44
some money if I’m going to continue college, so I said, well, I’ll go check it
42:51
out.
42:52
I went there and applied and I got the job.
42:55
I had a real good friend who worked there and she had been hired that
43:00
summer, and just this past year I had a lunch with her and she informed me
43:08
something that I really did not know.
43:11
She said she and two other, she was White and another White girl from McMinnville
43:19
or somewhere, also was hired at the same time.
43:23
She said that she and this other girl and some other new hires
43:28
were called in for a meeting.
43:32
I wasn’t called in as a new employee to that meeting.
43:35
She said that they were told they were going to hire a Black, I don’t think they
43:42
used Black then—negro—and they wanted to tell them that these new employees,
43:53
because they were opening up a new
43:59
one of the buildings for children, infants, and it was going to
44:04
be a nursery kind of setting.
44:08
They were hiring all new employees for that, and they wanted them to
44:14
know that they were going to hire this Black person and they wanted to know
44:18
if anybody had any problems with that.
44:20
I said, they said what?
44:23
She said, oh, you wouldn’t have known because you weren’t invited.
44:28
You were the one they were talking about [laughs] . So, I didn’t know.
44:32
Here again, I was just, I was so oblivious.
44:38
I just thought of myself as everybody else.
44:44
A lot of stuff probably went by me that was going on that I wouldn’t even had
44:50
had a clue.
44:50
When I found out, I didn’t waste any tears over it.
44:55
I just was kind of like, it was not my problem.
45:00
If you got to worry about it, and you got a problem, you worry
45:03
about it, but it’s not my problem.
45:05
I grew up that way and I guess I’ve retained that all my life.
45:11
What was your job, then, at the home?
45:14
I guess we were called,
45:19
kind of aides?
45:21
Nurses’ aides or something.
45:24
Because we weren’t nurses.
45:25
It
45:28
was built for, this particular building was new, it was built for infants.
45:34
They had children, infants, from birth, actually some of them were up to
45:41
teenagers, 15, 16, but they were completely incapacitated.
45:46
They had not ability to anything, except the down syndrome kids, which
45:56
although they were all on one ward, and they had equipment like
46:06
wash basins and toilets and showers
46:13
and little tables and little, every little chairs and things that they could use,
46:21
the person who was running
46:25
the ward at that time did not think that they could be taught anything.
46:33
That’s why I only worked there 2 years because I got fired because
46:39
I told her that, you know, we’re wasting a lot of equipment.
46:42
We have little chairs.
46:44
We have little tables.
46:46
We should be training these kids to sit in the little chairs and help feed.
46:50
Help them feed themselves, teach them how to feed themselves.
46:54
She told me, oh, you don’t know what you’re talking about.
46:57
You think you’re smart because you went to college.
46:59
I’m like, oh my goodness.
47:01
It’s like, that is only common sense.
47:03
Why do we have all this equipment if we can’t use it?
47:09
So, all these kids could do was go from the play area of their ward
47:17
where they had all kind of little tricycles and little bikes and stuff
47:23
to their bedroom, to the beds.
47:26
You’d put them in the bed and put the side up and lock it.
47:33
You couldn’t take them to teach them how to use the toilet,
47:36
which is a little toilet there?
47:38
Wash your hands?
47:39
We had a little table, little chairs were we could have put
47:43
them to sit and use plates and teach them how... oh my goodness.
47:47
So, anyway, I only worked there two years, but that was quite intense.
47:52
Then,
47:55
oh, I was, at that time I was attending Willamette and I worked a 12-hour shift.
48:04
It was hard to find time to sleep, so usually I’d sleep in
48:08
class by 10:00 every morning.
48:10
Was that Willamette—?
48:10
University, yeah.
48:13
So, I only went there for about a year.
48:15
What courses were you taking?
48:17
I
48:19
know I started out taking French, and then I couldn’t handle that because
48:25
it was at 10:00 in the morning.
48:28
I’d go to sleep.
48:31
I don’t know what all I was taking.
48:33
I wasn’t majoring in anything.
48:35
It was only my second year, third year.
48:40
Then, I came back to Portland and worked at the telephone company for a short time,
48:45
and then I finished up my degree at, it was Oregon College of Education then.
48:52
Now it’s Western Oregon State College.
48:58
That was education teaching.
49:02
What were your—at the telephone company, what were you doing?
49:07
Very, very boring,
49:12
reading, it seems like we were reading, figuring out the
49:18
amount of time people had...
49:24
we were reading tickets or something on long-distance calls, or something.
49:30
I can’t quite remember.
49:31
It was very boring and very tedious and monotonous and not
49:37
very long, not anything you’d want to do over a long period of time.
49:42
What was your experience, then when you went back to college?
49:47
Well, you know what, I have very little remembrance.
49:51
I just remember taking classes, and I lived off-campus because at the time
49:58
that I enrolled there was not another person of color that I could room with.
50:07
So, there was a family that lived, they were kind of a historic
50:13
family, owned a lot of property.
50:16
I can’t remember their name now.
50:19
It was in walking distance to the campus.
50:23
I somehow, I don’t even know how I, someone at the college must have said
50:29
maybe you could get a room because they
50:35
had a cabin that wasn’t, it was on their property but it
50:38
wasn’t a part of their house.
50:40
That’s where I roomed.
50:45
That did not bother me.
50:47
I thought that was wonderful [laughs] . I didn’t have to be on campus.
50:50
I didn’t have to follow any of their rules.
50:53
I did my own cooking, my own laundry, and I was just on my own.
50:59
Where
51:03
was the lodge?
51:04
It [takes a deep breath] , I don’t know.
51:06
It was in Monmouth.
51:09
It was in Monmouth.
51:11
It would have been ’53?
51:13
’52, ’53,
51:19
or
51:24
’54?
51:25
1953. You didn’t have a roommate, so you got to room somewhere.
51:31
I don’t even know how I got in touch with that family.
51:35
How did you choose that college?
51:38
I was just going to finish education.
51:40
It was a school for teachers.
51:42
It was a teacher training school at that time.
51:48
So, I walked to school.
51:50
I remember walking up, it would have been highway, it had a number...
51:59
to campus, take my classes, then my spring we had student teaching.
52:07
Seems like, and I can’t even remember how we got to the school.
52:12
It was a school that probably almost everybody went through there
52:16
did their student teaching there.
52:20
I remember going into the classroom and I was with two guys and both
52:27
of them were petrified of the kids.
52:30
It was like a fifth grade class.
52:33
They were just shaking.
52:35
I’m like, they’re just little kids!
52:38
What are you worrying about?
52:42
I got a lot of up front with the kids, because every chance I got a chance
52:46
to be in front of them, I liked to show off and I just loved the kids.
52:51
It was just a lot of fun for me, and it was, I think it was a fifth
52:55
grade class and I said, I have two other student teachers with me.
53:02
I remember the kids,
53:05
you know, they didn’t seem to have any problem with a Black
53:09
lady, colored lady, or whatever.
53:13
They just, they were fine.
53:17
At least to my observation, but probably as skit-zy as I was, I
53:23
wouldn’t even know if you were making fun of me or if you had problems.
53:26
But if you did?
53:26
You know, it’s your problem.
53:29
Not mine.
53:31
I remember those two guys, one of them was so, he just, he
53:35
never could go into teaching.
53:37
He just was such a nervous wreck.
53:39
It was too much for him.
53:40
The other guy did come back to Portland and taught.
53:47
That’s where I got my degree, my bachelor’s.
53:50
I remember one time, oh, by this time my mother had adopted one of her foster
53:58
kids and she was like, she was an infant.
54:04
I had to bring my infant sister to school with me for like a week,
54:10
or a few days, because my parents went out of town for some reason.
54:14
So, I had my little sister.
54:18
I took her, I was doing student teaching then, so I took her to the class with
54:22
the little kids, my little fifth graders.
54:25
I remember them saying, when she starts talking what language will she speak?
54:33
I said, well, what language would you think she would be talking?
54:38
What is she hearing?
54:39
They
54:42
couldn’t conceive, I don’t know what their problem was, but they thought
54:47
because she’s an infant and she’s black.
54:50
I don’t know what they thought.
54:53
I thought, what did you start speaking when you were an infant?
54:59
You spoke English because that’s
55:03
what you hear, you know?
55:04
They were just not informed.
55:09
At that time, what kind of friends, who were your friends?
55:14
Other than the girls at Fairview, those became my real close friends
55:20
and we, even after I left Fairview,
55:24
we were friends.
55:26
My grade school, that group that were on the front porch, they were still my
55:30
friends then while I was in Portland.
55:33
Then, when I graduated from, and started teaching in Portland, my first school was
55:43
Arleta School, which was from here, almost walking distance.
55:47
It was my first classroom assignment.
55:49
It was a half-day assignment, and I was a
55:56
seventh grade home room, but I only had them for a half-day.
56:03
My friends were college friends and the group, the grade school friends
56:11
we got together all the time, even though some of them already married
56:17
and were having kids and everything.
56:18
I was not into that.
56:22
So, college people that I met.
56:25
You hang on to some of your high school friends, you know, Black and White.
56:30
What kind of things would you do with them?
56:33
By this time, I’m dancing now.
56:36
I’m going to movies.
56:37
I’m doing all the things I was not allowed to do when I was in grade school
56:45
[laughs] . At that time,
56:49
Portland was very separate and segregated, and you couldn’t go to downtown dances
56:58
when name people came into town.
57:01
Very rarely could you.
57:03
You could go to McElroy’s Ballroom, I believe.
57:08
But then there were places on Williams Avenue, where Black people had clubs and
57:16
White people could go if they wanted to, but, you know, Black people could go.
57:26
Those were the kinds of things we did.
57:28
We’d go to Citizens and sit and drink.
57:33
We’d only take one coke and make it last for four or five hours
57:37
because you didn’t have any money.
57:39
McElroy’s,
57:44
we went to a ballroom.
57:49
There were several places anyway that we had.
57:52
Then, when I started teaching, I only taught for a half year.
57:56
My first assignment which was at Arleta School, because, as I say, it was
58:01
a half day and I wanted more money.
58:05
I got a chance for a full-day assignment, but it was at Kennedy
58:11
School, which was clear across town.
58:16
At that time, my dad would drive me to school because for some reason
58:20
he wasn’t... was he retired then?
58:22
I guess.
58:23
Anyway, my first year I taught a half-year at Arleta and then the next half of the
58:30
year I moved over to Kennedy School.
58:33
I had a little experience with Kennedy School that I just have to share with you.
58:40
That’s almost out to where we lived before, out in Kenton.
58:44
Those are neighborhoods that are very close.
58:50
But, by this time, there were a number of, there might have been a few Black people
58:55
in the neighborhood, but not too many.
58:58
The classroom that I was assigned to, I didn’t know who the kids were,
59:04
but it was a full-day assignment.
59:05
That’s all I was concerned about.
59:07
It
59:11
turns out, that when I take over the classroom after Christmas
59:17
break in January, my class is about half Black and half White.
59:25
it was special ed.
59:27
Nobody told me that.
59:28
I did not have special ed certification or even any training, other than working
59:34
at Fairview, which wasn’t teaching then.
59:38
Anyway, it was a full-day assignment, so that will work for me.
59:44
I worked there that year, the rest of that year until June.
59:52
I decided that an offer came through the school district or something that
1:00:00
anybody who wanted to work selling, I don’t know, some kind of magazines
1:00:05
or books or something during the summer, could sign up to do that.
1:00:10
I thought, well that will be more money.
1:00:11
I’ll do that.
1:00:12
So, I sign up.
1:00:15
I get a call one afternoon, evening, from this lady.
1:00:23
She said, oh, I see you signed up to work the summer to sell
1:00:28
these books or whatever it was.
1:00:31
I’m just calling to tell you that we’re going to have a meeting at my
1:00:35
house for people who’ve signed up so we can explain what the process
1:00:39
is and what needs to be done.
1:00:43
The director of the northwest project is going to be at my house and she’ll
1:00:49
take over and explain everything.
1:00:51
So, she told me all these details of the fact.
1:00:53
I said, oh, fine.
1:00:54
That’ll be good.
1:00:58
In the course of her talking, she said, oh what school?
1:01:01
What school do you teach?
1:01:03
I said,
1:01:06
well, I’m at Kennedy.
1:01:08
Was it Kennedy then?
1:01:09
Whatever the school was.
1:01:12
She said, oh.
1:01:13
Now we’re on the phone, okay.
1:01:16
She said, well, is that the school where the darkies teach?
1:01:17
I said, oh.
1:01:23
Darkies?
1:01:24
[Laughs]
1:01:27
My mother and dad were in the other room, and they heard me say darkies
1:01:30
and they both came out to where they could see me on the phone
1:01:33
because they knew I was going to do something [laughs] . I said, darkies?
1:01:40
I said,
1:01:42
I don’t know.
1:01:43
I said, what are darkies?
1:01:45
What do you mean?
1:01:47
My folks said, oh Lord, what is this child going to do now [laughs] . I kept
1:01:53
that woman talking for over a half hour.
1:01:56
I’m not kidding you, about darkies.
1:02:00
I asked her all kind of asinine questions that I could think of,
1:02:03
and what, well, what are darkies?
1:02:07
What do they do?
1:02:08
What are they like?
1:02:10
Well, why do you call them darkies?
1:02:12
[Laughs] This lady’s just explaining all this to me.
1:02:20
I was cracking up, because I thought wait until I...So she
1:02:21
said, I said, well, now tell me.
1:02:25
Her name was Mrs. Lee.
1:02:26
I said, Mrs. Lee had you ever had any darkies at your house?
1:02:29
She said, oh no.
1:02:31
Oh no.
1:02:32
I said, oh, well, why not?
1:02:33
Well, I just, I guess I don’t know any darkies.
1:02:37
I don’t know any of them.
1:02:39
I said, oh you don’t.
1:02:40
Oh, okay.
1:02:41
Well, thank you very much.
1:02:43
I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon.
1:02:46
I go into the classroom the next day and I couldn’t wait to
1:02:49
get to the principal’s office.
1:02:50
I said, Mr. Berkheart, you are just going to flip.
1:02:54
I said, you don’t know what reputation
1:03:00
has in the city.
1:03:01
He said, now what are you up to?
1:03:04
[Laughs] Because he had worked with me for a half year.
1:03:08
I said, well your school has a reputation as the school where the darkies teach.
1:03:14
He said, oh my God.
1:03:15
What are you saying?
1:03:18
I was the only darkie in the school teaching.
1:03:23
I was just hysterical.
1:03:25
He said, oh, my goodness.
1:03:27
He said, oh, well, are you going to go to that meeting?
1:03:29
I said, if I have to crawl up those steps, I’ll be there.
1:03:33
So, I did.
1:03:35
I did go.
1:03:36
But I have told that story about the school where the darkies teach.
1:03:40
I went to Mrs. Lee’s house.
1:03:42
I walked up the steps and knocked on the door.
1:03:44
Mrs. Lee came to the door.
1:03:46
I guess it was Mrs. Lee.
1:03:49
She said, she opened the door, and I said, oh, Mrs. Lee, I’m Mrs. Emanuel.
1:03:54
I talked to you last night on the telephone.
1:03:58
She never said come in, go away.
1:04:03
She turned around.
1:04:04
She turned red as a beet and I never saw her again.
1:04:09
She closed the door?
1:04:11
No.
1:04:11
I opened the screen door, walked in, got my cup, and put my tea in and sat
1:04:17
down, had a cookie or two and everything.
1:04:19
I never saw her again.
1:04:20
I’m sitting in her living room with all the other people and we
1:04:24
were just chatting and everything.
1:04:28
Finally, the person who was going to take over the meeting.
1:04:33
I said, I need to speak to you.
1:04:35
I told her, I wouldn’t work for your company.
1:04:39
You have hired a person that had this conversation, I told
1:04:43
her about the conversation, over a half hour on the phone.
1:04:46
I said, I can’t work for a company like that.
1:04:49
You need to get this straightened out.
1:04:51
You need to take her off of representing.
1:04:53
She should not be talking to anybody on the phone.
1:04:56
I said whatever else I said.
1:04:59
I was pretty mouthy in those days [laughs] , and I didn’t mind
1:05:03
saying anything I felt like saying.
1:05:07
She was oh so apologetic and everything.
1:05:09
I said, you don’t have to apologize to me.
1:05:11
I don’t have a problem, but you have this person talking to someone on the phone
1:05:16
to whom she has not met, she does not know, and this is how she’s carrying on.
1:05:21
That was my experience with, anyway, but I stayed at that school for another year.
1:05:30
I was teaching special ed kids and I loved them.
1:05:35
I guess they loved me, because they gave me a dog for
1:05:38
Christmas, a Christmas present.
1:05:40
They knew I loved dogs.
1:05:41
I had read them a story about Sir Oliver, and it was about a boy and his dog.
1:05:48
They gave me a dog and said you have to name the dog Sir
1:05:51
Oliver, and that’s what I did.
1:05:54
Then the next year I got a call to come to Oakland.
1:05:57
I had interviewed there, and I wanted to go away from home, because
1:06:00
I had never been away from home.
1:06:02
You were how old by then?
1:06:05
I would have been...that was my first year teaching, so I would have
1:06:08
been 22 or 3 something like that?
1:06:12
Where is Oakland?
1:06:13
Oakland, California.
1:06:15
Oh.
1:06:16
Before you go to California, I wanted you to elaborate on your dancing experiences.
1:06:23
Oh.
1:06:25
Where you danced.
1:06:26
Who was dancing there, what the whole social milieu was like.
1:06:30
Oh, I can’t even name—I probably have stuff listed, but
1:06:36
I mean, just fun dancing.
1:06:39
There was the, it wasn’t the Elks Club.
1:06:43
Oh, geeze, see my memory is pretty shot if you haven’t noticed.
1:06:48
Oh
1:06:51
what was the name of the club?
1:06:53
Every Saturday, Friday/Saturday night my girlfriends and I would go out.
1:06:57
Where was the club?
1:06:58
It was off of Williams Avenue
1:07:07
and
1:07:13
south of Broadway off of Williams Avenue.
1:07:16
There were several clubs and they’d play, they had some bands, local
1:07:24
bands, and we’d just go and dance until we couldn’t dance anymore.
1:07:30
What kind of music?
1:07:31
The swing.
1:07:32
Mostly swing.
1:07:33
Was
1:07:36
it mostly musicians?
1:07:37
There were local musicians that played at several clubs.
1:07:41
African Americans and White?
1:07:43
Some of them were mixed.
1:07:45
Mostly, those clubs were African American, Black.
1:07:50
Was it mainly Blacks that were dancing?
1:07:52
Be a mixture of, no, be a mixture of Whites and Blacks.
1:07:56
Since Blacks couldn’t dance downtown, if you have White friends, they’d
1:08:03
come and dance in the Black clubs.
1:08:09
McElroy’s Ballroom was one place we’d go frequently.
1:08:12
I think that was right on Williams Avenue, right at... see, I can’t
1:08:18
think of the streets that were, it would be south of Broadway,
1:08:24
but that was a real popular place.
1:08:29
People like Duke Ellington came there once.
1:08:33
There
1:08:36
were some name places and there was the, what was the club?
1:08:43
South of Williams Avenue, no, west of Williams Avenue, there was a club there.
1:08:51
There was the Cotton Club.
1:08:54
There was Paul’s, Paul’s Paradise.
1:08:59
We’d just make the circuit.
1:09:01
How were the Whites received in those clubs?
1:09:07
Nobody bothered them to my knowledge.
1:09:09
They felt very comfortable.
1:09:10
See,
1:09:12
my problem is, and I’m probably not explaining things maybe the way
1:09:17
somebody else would because I couldn’t come up with a problem if I had to.
1:09:24
I just didn’t bother with it.
1:09:26
It was not something that bothered me.
1:09:31
The way I was raised is that we didn’t focus on Black and
1:09:35
White or not-Black or not-White.
1:09:39
Even growing up we went to an all-White church.
1:09:43
We used to walk right down the street about 4 blocks to Lents
1:09:47
Seventh Day Adventist Church, and we were the only Black folks in it.
1:09:51
At the dance halls, just
1:09:57
describe the way they were.
1:09:59
Was it dancing as swing?
1:10:04
You danced with other men?
1:10:05
Make friends?
1:10:07
Yeah.
1:10:08
It was.
1:10:08
Give a picture.
1:10:10
[Laughs] My memory is... you know how long ago that was.
1:10:16
I’d usually go with a couple real close friends, like one friend,
1:10:20
Betty Jean, Betty Duke, her father was instrumental in bringing some
1:10:28
name Black artists to Portland.
1:10:33
Stanton Duke brought,
1:10:38
what’s his name, Lionel Hampton, and, see I’m not going to be able to name,
1:10:45
but some known people because he had, I don’t know how he had contacts.
1:10:50
He was a railroad person.
1:10:56
The railroad jobs that Black people had were porters on the railroad,
1:11:01
or, another job was when they had the Portland Hotel, which is where Pioneer
1:11:08
Courthouse now, a lot of Black people worked, young guys, that was one of the
1:11:15
first jobs a young Black man could get working as a porter in the Portland Hotel.
1:11:24
You know, and railroad jobs, and other than that, if you weren’t a
1:11:32
cleaning a school or cleaning, like my father worked for a long time, he was
1:11:43
a, what do you call it?
1:11:44
He did metal work in a garage on Division and 52nd for years.
1:11:55
Then, he worked at Adventist Hospital as
1:12:02
kind of an interim clean-up, doing that kind of stuff.
1:12:09
He did that for years and then moved out to Adventist Hospital
1:12:12
here at east Portland area.
1:12:18
Like the dancing scene was, there were just a number of clubs up
1:12:24
Williams Avenue area in the ’40s,
1:12:30
‘50s.
1:12:30
As soon as people got a little money, and they got money from the
1:12:34
shipyards and from that kind of work, and then, I mean, Friday and
1:12:40
Saturday night the joint was jumping.
1:12:43
Did you go with a group of girlfriends?
1:12:46
Usually, usually—
1:12:47
Was it mixed with girls and young Black women?
1:12:51
Mainly I went with my girlfriend Betty Duke, because we both lived out here
1:13:01
when we were driving, one or the other of us would drive.
1:13:05
We also had, the only other thing that I remember, because being an Adventist
1:13:10
I didn’t do a lot of things that other people did until I got old enough to not
1:13:15
worry about it, when I decided that was foolish and didn’t need to be doing that.
1:13:22
We’d
1:13:24
go skating.
1:13:26
Monday night was all-skate Black out on Sandy Boulevard.
1:13:29
I don’t remember what the name of it was, but it was on Sandy Boulevard
1:13:37
and Monday nights was skating night.
1:13:39
It would be filled with Black folks, only Black folks.
1:13:43
That was the night to go skate.
1:13:44
That was all through high school.
1:13:47
I don’t remember doing that in college.
1:13:53
I don’t know why I stopped.
1:13:54
I just probably didn’t want to skate anymore.
1:13:57
You couldn’t go to Oaks Park, which was the amusement park area.
1:14:04
You couldn’t go to Jantzen Beach, which had the amusement park area
1:14:08
and all the rides and the equipment.
1:14:12
You certainly couldn’t go in the swimming pool.
1:14:15
Some
1:14:19
of those things, because I guess I was raised Adventist I didn’t do anyway,
1:14:23
like dancing and that kind of thing, until I got to college and then I
1:14:27
was like Adventist or no Adventist.
1:14:30
I was still playing piano at the Adventist church, but dancing all
1:14:35
Friday night practically hung over it on Saturday morning trying to play
1:14:39
the piano [laughs] . Anyway, whatever.
1:14:46
Now, we’re going to get you to Oakland where you had your next teaching job.
1:14:52
My next teaching experience.
1:14:54
You’re right.
1:14:55
I was called to Oakland because I was interviewed as a
1:14:59
graduate right out of college.
1:15:03
I went to San Francisco and Oakland, because I just wanted to leave home.
1:15:07
San Francisco looked to me like, hmm, go away, girl.
1:15:13
So, I came back to Portland.
1:15:14
Then I went to, when I interviewed at Oakland, they said, well, we
1:15:19
don’t have any vacancies right now, but we are anticipating maybe
1:15:24
some vacancies within a year or two and we’ll surely give you a call.
1:15:27
I said, yeah right.
1:15:30
But, in two years, Oakland did call me.
1:15:34
So, I went.
1:15:36
I didn’t know anybody in Oakland, and I have stayed at the YWCA,
1:15:43
and I met a lady who lived
1:15:48
in east Oakland.
1:15:50
She said, well, you can’t stay here.
1:15:52
No.
1:15:52
You’re going to come to my house, and you’re going to spend the night there.
1:15:56
I thought, oh okay!
1:16:01
So, I did get hired and it turned out that the school where I was hired was
1:16:06
walking distance from where this lady, who I had met at the YWCA, lived.
1:16:14
I stayed at her house for a while and then I got an apartment in a
1:16:20
new building that was just like a block away from where she lived.
1:16:26
It was walking distance to the school.
1:16:29
I started teaching at that school that September.
1:16:35
I could walk to the school and it was just really nice.
1:16:39
It was east Oakland.
1:16:41
At that time, Oakland did not have reputation it has, because
1:16:46
it was it was ’56, I guess?
1:16:51
’56 or ‘7, something like that.
1:16:55
It was the first time I had any dealings with Hispanic kids.
1:16:59
I had quite a few Hispanic kids, some really sharp kids,
1:17:03
some really, oh, pitiful kids.
1:17:07
So, it was quite an experience.
1:17:08
I had the sixth grade, and I was there for 2 years and then I got married.
1:17:16
Then I moved to San Diego.
1:17:19
That’s kind of my history to... so, teaching in Oakland,
1:17:24
I just loved my class.
1:17:27
I loved my kids.
1:17:29
I had good neighbors, and I lived where I lived.
1:17:35
Then, I got married.
1:17:36
That was downhill from there
1:17:41
[laughs] . That’s my opinion now, so, anyway.
1:17:44
There you go.
1:17:45
Do you want to give us a little bit about that part of your life?
1:17:50
Well, teaching fifth grade in Oakland was very enjoyable, really.
1:17:57
I really enjoyed it.
1:17:57
It had a nice faculty.
1:18:01
Here, of course, was the first time, as I say, here in Portland I was the only
1:18:07
Black at my first school, and I think I was the only Black that I knew of,
1:18:12
maybe there was one more Black teacher at Kenton School where I moved to,
1:18:19
but when I went to Oakland there were several Black teachers in the school.
1:18:25
A nice faculty.
1:18:26
A nice mixed faculty.
1:18:29
You know, I wasn’t paying any attention to whether, I didn’t care whether they
1:18:32
were Black, White, or purple, really.
1:18:34
I didn’t care.
1:18:36
But that was my first real close contact, except for the Black people that I
1:18:43
met in Portland that were teachers.
1:18:46
I guess I met them through the, well, I became a member of the
1:18:49
sorority while in Portland, so I met a lot of Black teachers, then.
1:18:55
I forgot about that,
1:18:59
because I was initiated into Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.
1:19:03
That was my, actually that was my first real contact with any large
1:19:10
group of Black people, because the church was White until I was 15.
1:19:18
Then, I guess, oh, I know what.
1:19:20
My folks helped open a Black church.
1:19:24
They were bringing a Black minister who had been the first
1:19:27
one to come to Oregon in maybe
1:19:38
’55 or something like, I don’t know, somewhere around.
1:19:40
That was the Seventh Day Adventist?
1:19:41
That was the Seventh Day Adventist church, and they brought a Black minister.
1:19:44
The
1:19:47
theory that they had in mind was that all Black people needed
1:19:50
to go to the Black church.
1:19:53
Well, my folks didn’t buy that, but they got talked into it because you
1:19:58
need to help us build up a church.
1:20:02
Then, if you want to go back to your neighborhood, well, by this time,
1:20:07
my brother and I decided we didn’t want to go back to the neighborhood
1:20:09
church anyway, because—you know what?
1:20:14
We ran into more problems with the White church than we did with the White
1:20:19
school, now that I think about it.
1:20:22
That’s another long story.
1:20:22
Well, tell us about that.
1:20:24
[Laughs] Well, okay.
1:20:27
We were the only Blacks in our church, my brother and I and my mom and my dad.
1:20:31
Nobody,
1:20:36
you never really felt mistreated.
1:20:38
You just felt
1:20:42
overlooked.
1:20:45
As I say, my brother and my dad had beautiful voices.
1:20:51
My mom and I could manage harmony, but my brother had a beautiful voice.
1:20:56
My dad had a beautiful tenor voice.
1:20:58
They always wanted my brother and dad to sing.
1:21:02
Of course, they were glad to oblige because they loved to sing.
1:21:09
My brother and I, as we were growing up we were paying attention to
1:21:12
the things people were saying.
1:21:13
Like, the church group would have picnics or parties and stuff, and
1:21:19
you never really felt like they were welcoming you to come to the fun things.
1:21:25
Yeah, you could come to the church and read the scripture.
1:21:28
As
1:21:31
I got older, about 12, 13, 14, I had a little attitude anyway,
1:21:39
and my brother was so much calmer and [laughs] unconcerned as I was.
1:21:47
I’d get all upset and irritated at something.
1:21:51
My brother competed in a competition that the church would have, all the Adventist
1:21:59
churches would have, this amateur hour.
1:22:03
My brother
1:22:06
entered one as a contestant, and
1:22:12
so he was going to sing.
1:22:12
He
1:22:15
had such a beautiful voice that there’s just no way... he should have,
1:22:18
in his category he should have won.
1:22:21
Okay, so, he was up against a couple, a man and a woman, I
1:22:27
guess they were husband and wife.
1:22:30
Their skit they put together had Rastus and Magnolia, I think it was, on the
1:22:40
porch washing, she was washing clothes.
1:22:45
Well, they were in
1:22:50
blackface.
1:22:51
I’m like, oh no.
1:22:54
Really?
1:22:55
So, she’s washing clothes and so she’s splashing the water and
1:23:02
Rastus is losing some of his color on his blackface, which really was
1:23:07
funny, but it wasn’t appropriate.
1:23:10
My brother sang in that same category of whatever that category was,
1:23:16
and they won over his beautiful singing of whatever it was.
1:23:23
I said, I’m done.
1:23:25
I am through with this church.
1:23:27
It’s nothing but a bunch of stupid, bigoted fools, and I
1:23:31
don’t want to be bothered anymore.
1:23:35
We kind of did go to the Black church and help them get started.
1:23:39
I played the piano for them for a couple of years.
1:23:42
Then when I was really through with them was when my mother adopted one
1:23:46
of her foster kids and people in the church were saying it was my kid!
1:23:51
I’m like, are you serious?
1:23:54
I’ve been here playing the piano, how did I have this child?
1:23:59
Every Saturday I played the piano and I had this child?
1:24:05
I’m through.
1:24:06
I’m done with y’all.
1:24:07
It doesn’t take that much to get me out anyway.
1:24:12
You know, when you go to Oakland, you don’t, you run into, I wasn’t
1:24:19
going to church anymore, then.
1:24:21
I’d go to visit somebody’s church or something, but
1:24:27
Oakland was just, Black people and White people and they weren’t
1:24:32
worrying about, to my knowledge, they were not worrying about who’s, you
1:24:36
know, are you this or are you that.
1:24:38
You look back at your experience at the church and maybe other places
1:24:45
here in Portland and you’re like,
1:24:49
oh.
1:24:50
Is that what that was?
1:24:52
Up to that point, because it wasn’t something I bothered
1:24:56
about or worried about.
1:25:00
Did that answer part of the question?
1:25:01
Yes.
1:25:03
Yes.
1:25:03
That’s
1:25:06
very interesting.
1:25:07
Now, we’re—
1:25:08
We’re in Oakland.
1:25:09
Now you’re in Oakland.
1:25:10
You got married.
1:25:11
Yeah.
1:25:12
Then what happened?
1:25:15
Well, I bought a ’49 Cadillac.
1:25:18
I bought it.
1:25:22
Then, my husband.
1:25:24
Wait, what year is this now?
1:25:26
This is ’57 or
1:25:35
’58?
1:25:37
Yeah, it was about ’56, ’57, something like that because I don’t have a
1:25:37
child yet, and she was born in ’58.
1:25:37
So, it’s
1:25:45
about a 7-year-old Cadillac.
1:25:48
Right [laughs] . Well, I thought it was in good shape, cool.
1:25:52
I’m
1:25:57
living there, so I have a car.
1:25:59
I marry this Navy man, who’s stationed...
1:26:06
Vallejo?
1:26:07
He wasn’t in Oakland then.
1:26:09
Anyway, when he was in town, of course we were together, and
1:26:15
so I get married in Oakland.
1:26:19
I knew that night, I said, this is the wrong thing.
1:26:22
You are not doing right.
1:26:23
I called my mom.
1:26:25
I’m saying, Mom I don’t want to get married.
1:26:27
She says, where are you?
1:26:30
I said, I’m in Oakland.
1:26:32
She said, I’m in Portland.
1:26:35
What do you want me to do?
1:26:36
I’m like, I don’t know
1:26:39
but I don’t want to get married.
1:26:41
She said, well, don’t tell me.
1:26:43
It ain’t my problem.
1:26:45
Anyway, okay, so
1:26:51
he has the car sometime when he’s in town.
1:26:53
Then he gets transferred to San Diego.
1:26:57
I still have the Cadillac.
1:27:00
Then he comes up one weekend and he says he needs the car in San Diego.
1:27:06
I’m like, why?
1:27:08
You’re on a base.
1:27:09
You don’t need... but anyway.
1:27:11
So, he took the car.
1:27:12
The
1:27:15
car, within a week, is wrecked.
1:27:19
Don’t know how it got wrecked.
1:27:21
He said he was teaching a girl to drive.
1:27:24
I said, oh, I’m done [laughs] , but I wasn’t really done, because you know.
1:27:29
But, he had the car.
1:27:31
The car was gone.
1:27:33
He’s in San Diego.
1:27:35
Then, at
1:27:38
the end of my school year, I moved to San Diego.
1:27:42
I don’t like San Diego.
1:27:43
I don’t like where we’re living.
1:27:45
I don’t like... anyway.
1:27:48
Why?
1:27:49
It was just a rundown area in the place he could find.
1:27:57
I didn’t like it.
1:27:58
Anyway, then I get pregnant.
1:28:02
My daughter, Gerri, is born in San Diego.
1:28:08
It’s just not, it’s just not quite right.
1:28:11
I know it’s not right, but I’m in it.
1:28:14
What do I do?
1:28:17
No sense in talking to my mom because she said you made your
1:28:19
bed, you lay in it [laughs] . So,
1:28:26
we’re there two years, and I get pregnant again.
1:28:31
So, he’s getting ready to be transferred to a place called
1:28:34
Beeville, Texas, and I’m pregnant.
1:28:38
I said, no child of mine is going to be born in Beeville, Texas.
1:28:42
How is that going to sound?
1:28:44
That ain’t even right.
1:28:46
I come back to Portland.
1:28:47
The second child, Maureen, is born here in Portland.
1:28:51
I stay here until she’s about 9 months or so, and I substitute
1:28:57
teach here and whatever.
1:28:58
Are you living with your parents?
1:28:59
I’m living with Mom next door.
1:29:01
Mom’s house is this house next door, actually.
1:29:04
This was the chicken yard.
1:29:08
So, then we go to Texas, and it seems that the day that we arrived he had
1:29:17
gotten orders to go to Michigan.
1:29:20
Because he had been there over a year.
1:29:24
Then he gets order to go to Michigan, so we’re going to drive to Michigan.
1:29:28
So, I don’t have any experience with Beeville except the house where
1:29:34
we stayed with some people that he knew for like 2 days or something.
1:29:40
I went to, oh
1:29:43
the night that he was asking me to come and join him on the base for
1:29:49
a going away something or other.
1:29:52
I said, well, I don’t have any appropriate clothes, so I’ve got to go somewhere.
1:29:56
He said, well, ask the people at the house where you’re staying and they’ll tell you.
1:30:02
Those people gave us, me and the two girls then, the baby and Gerri, their bedroom.
1:30:10
It was a luscious bedroom, bath connected.
1:30:14
I don’t remember going any place in the house, but I must have
1:30:16
gone to the kitchen or something.
1:30:18
Anyway, so I asked them, I need to buy something kind of spiffy for, you
1:30:24
know, for this party that’s going on.
1:30:28
Where can I go downtown?
1:30:29
Now, we’re in Beeville, okay?
1:30:32
They said, oh, just go to Joanne’s downtown.
1:30:35
We always shop there.
1:30:36
Okay, so I go to Joanne’s.
1:30:39
I walked into Joanne’s.
1:30:41
The two ladies standing there, salespeople, they do not say
1:30:45
hello, good afternoon, get out.
1:30:48
They don’t say anything.
1:30:50
I’m, oh, okay.
1:30:51
I look at them like, oh, that’s the way you’re going to be.
1:30:54
I walk all through the store and I’m looking around and finally I
1:30:57
said, I’m looking for kind of a cocktail type dress, size, you know.
1:31:04
We don’t have anything like that.
1:31:06
I said, oh.
1:31:08
Well, would you know where I might find something?
1:31:10
Oh, Sears next door will probably have something.
1:31:13
I said, oh, thank you very much.
1:31:16
I go out, and I go to Sears next door.
1:31:18
Sears is just about as bad, but not quite as bad.
1:31:21
But they won’t let you try on anything.
1:31:25
I thought, oh this place is way too crazy for me.
1:31:29
Anyway, I picked up something and I thought.
1:31:32
I thought to myself, now why do these people who live here, military
1:31:35
people, who live in this town tell me to go to Mrs. Jones and say that
1:31:41
they shop there all the time and Mrs. Jones didn’t acknowledge my presence.
1:31:45
I’m like, oh they’re all crazy, Black and White.
1:31:49
They’re all crazy.
1:31:51
So, that was my decision.
1:31:56
That’s how I comprehended that.
1:31:58
So, then we drove up from there to Michigan.
1:32:00
I had
1:32:04
the two kids.
1:32:07
It was quite interesting.
1:32:10
My husband sends me to get coffee.
1:32:12
I think the first morning we got out.
1:32:15
He sends me to get coffee and it was across the street
1:32:18
from, he’s going to get gas.
1:32:20
So, the gas station’s on one corner and the bus depot’s on the other.
1:32:25
I said, well, I can go in the bus station and get some coffee.
1:32:30
Well, I walked in the front door of the bus depot.
1:32:36
The people, all of them are looking at me like, uh... I don’t even pick up on it.
1:32:43
I’m like, why are they just standing there?
1:32:46
Are they all, what?
1:32:49
I’m not thinking.
1:32:50
So, I don’t know where we are.
1:32:52
We haven’t gotten out of Texas yet, so I’m like, okay.
1:32:58
I said, excuse me.
1:33:00
I’m looking for some coffee.
1:33:02
Can you tell me if you have coffee anywhere?
1:33:05
Oh yeah, we have coffee.
1:33:06
But you have to go next door.
1:33:09
I said, oh.
1:33:10
Okay.
1:33:11
So, instead of going out the door and around into the other
1:33:16
door, there’s a side door, and I walk through that like a dummy.
1:33:20
I don’t know.
1:33:22
I walk through from the White side to the Black side.
1:33:25
Well, I shouldn’t have come through that door, because the
1:33:30
Black door had an attitude.
1:33:32
I said.
1:33:34
They’re just standing there looking at me like
1:33:38
[staring expression] , where’d you come from?
1:33:41
You know?
1:33:42
I don’t pick up on it.
1:33:43
I’m not thinking.
1:33:45
I said, I’m trying to get some coffee, one with cream and sugar and one just black.
1:33:56
They start slinging stuff at me, just here!
1:34:00
Here’s the cream.
1:34:02
I’m like, oh, my God.
1:34:04
They’re all... and I said, well, I’d like a few donuts, too.
1:34:06
I thought, well, all of these people are crazy [laughs]
1:34:10
. They’re all crazy in this town.
1:34:12
Let me get out of here.
1:34:14
I just had no.
1:34:15
I’d not experienced that to that extent.
1:34:19
I’m like, well, okay.
1:34:22
But I’d come through the wrong door for the Black people.
1:34:25
So, I got my coffee and I went out.
1:34:27
Then we drove on to Michigan.
1:34:29
That was different, too.
1:34:32
What about the ride as you went to
1:34:37
Michigan?
1:34:37
Did you stay overnight?
1:34:37
Don’t remember anything.
1:34:39
No, I don’t remember.
1:34:40
I think, I do not remember stopping, but I do remember when we left Portland and
1:34:47
landed in Corpus Christi, we could not
1:34:55
overnight in any hotel of name.
1:35:00
We found some little old crappy hotel the first night in
1:35:04
Corpus Christi that was just,
1:35:08
we could stay there.
1:35:09
It was cockroach-ridden.
1:35:12
Oh, it was just a mess.
1:35:15
But, that’s what was available.
1:35:18
Then you got to Michigan.
1:35:19
Right.
1:35:20
Got to Michigan.
1:35:21
We were in Navy housing.
1:35:24
What town were you in?
1:35:30
Can’t say it right now... to Michigan.
1:35:33
Michigan we were in... it was a Naval air station.
1:35:40
I hope I wrote it down.
1:35:42
I’ll think of it when I don’t want to, but right now I can’t think of it.
1:35:46
It was outside of Detroit.
1:35:48
It was on an island.
1:35:50
Grosse Ile!
1:35:50
Gross Ile, Michigan.
1:35:54
It was a Naval air station.
1:35:58
It was Navy housing, and it was kind of old and creaky, but it was okay.
1:36:11
We stayed there, oh,
1:36:15
let’s see... over a year?
1:36:21
Then, he got orders to go to some place
1:36:27
in the south on...I can’t... why can’t I remember these places?
1:36:37
What were some of your experiences in Michigan?
1:36:40
Michigan?
1:36:41
Nothing to speak of.
1:36:42
I remember dancing.
1:36:44
I remember dancing and I was pregnant again/ By the time I got to Michigan,
1:36:49
I got pregnant again there and dancing with the youngest one and this tummy
1:36:55
going, and I’m just tearing it up.
1:36:57
That’s when the,
1:37:01
what’s his name?
1:37:04
That played... see, why can’t I think of anybody’s name?
1:37:09
Anyway, everybody was doing the twist then.
1:37:12
I was twisting away.
1:37:16
The only thing I remember about Michigan is—
1:37:18
What is Chubby Checkers?
1:37:20
Yeah,
1:37:26
Chubby Checkers, the twist [laughs] . It seemed like they
1:37:26
had a dance very Friday night and
1:37:32
I don’t remember him being there, though, so I’m not sure why he wasn’t.
1:37:37
There were a couple of gals in the housing that always, we’d get
1:37:42
together and pay for a babysitter, because everybody had babies.
1:37:48
We’d go to the dance and just dance by ourselves just to
1:37:53
do the twist and what not.
1:37:56
So, your husband didn’t go with you?
1:37:57
I don’t remember him.
1:37:58
I don’t remember why.
1:38:03
It’s a mystery, but I don’t remember why.
1:38:06
I don’t remember our husbands being there.
1:38:08
I don’t remember what was going on, if they had some kind of off-base activities
1:38:14
or something that they had to go to.
1:38:17
Don’t know.
1:38:17
Then, were you teaching?
1:38:19
The only teaching I did then was I started a little nursery school for all the
1:38:25
little kids in our unit, in our housing.
1:38:29
Everybody had little kids, 3, 5, 6, 3-year-olds.
1:38:34
I had all this equipment.
1:38:36
I had all this, the letters and the numbers and pumpkins and art stuff.
1:38:43
We broke into one of the empty units and I set up a room there
1:38:49
and I worked with the little kids.
1:38:52
My oldest daughter, then, she didn’t want me to talk to the other little
1:38:56
kids, so she wouldn’t participate, but she had to go in the room with me.
1:39:01
She’s learning, but she’s not actively learning, but she’s learning [laughs]
1:39:08
. There at the base was mixed?
1:39:10
Right.
1:39:13
We were the only Blacks, I think, in our housing.
1:39:20
We became close friends with several families there.
1:39:27
We’d drive to, there wasn’t any close shopping, but there was
1:39:34
military shopping an hour drive away.
1:39:38
I can’t remember the name of the town, but we would get together and
1:39:41
everybody would have their grocery list and bring back stuff for people
1:39:46
who couldn’t go and load up the car.
1:39:49
Somebody would babysit.
1:39:51
We
1:39:53
had it organized, but then when he got orders to go to,
1:40:00
it’s not Corpus Christi... it’s on the coast.
1:40:04
Tell me some military establishments on the coast?
1:40:09
Which coast?
1:40:10
East coast, like
1:40:14
North Carolina.
1:40:17
South Carolina?
1:40:19
Norfolk?
1:40:21
Could be.
1:40:22
Yeah.
1:40:22
It would have been a Naval something.
1:40:26
Norfolk.
1:40:26
Norfolk, Virginia.
1:40:27
That sounds good.
1:40:28
But I said I wasn’t going to go and take my kids to the south, so I didn’t go.
1:40:33
Where did I end up?
1:40:35
Philadelphia with my husband’s mother in her crowded little apartment, which it was
1:40:45
amazing that she could put us in there.
1:40:47
But we stayed there.
1:40:48
I stayed there until my youngest daughter was born in Philadelphia, and then I
1:40:54
moved to an apartment out of her house.
1:40:58
She lived in south Philly.
1:41:00
South Philly was a little too wild for me.
1:41:06
Explain that.
1:41:08
[Laughs] What I remember is my mother-in-law was the
1:41:12
sweetest lady in the world.
1:41:14
Her house was tiny, tiny.
1:41:15
It was one of those, I don’t know if you’d call it a shotgun house?
1:41:21
They’re kind of straight through?
1:41:23
Yeah.
1:41:25
She had room one, room two, room three, then the kitchen and the
1:41:31
bathroom was off the side of the kitchen and then she had a backyard.
1:41:36
She had a basement, too, a cellar.
1:41:40
It was a cellar.
1:41:41
It was a house that had been reconstructed because those original
1:41:48
houses had living quarters, family quarters on the first floors.
1:41:54
Second floor was probably bedrooms and third floor.
1:41:58
They had reconfigured so that one family was on the first floor, all those rooms
1:42:06
were their bedrooms and you walked through the living room, what not,
1:42:10
two bedrooms to get to the kitchen.
1:42:13
So, then, they had a stairway for another family for the
1:42:17
second floor and the third floor.
1:42:19
Anyway, we survived for a short while.
1:42:24
Then I got my own apartment.
1:42:26
South Philly,
1:42:30
with my mother-in-law, who is the sweetest woman in the world, and every
1:42:34
morning, every morning, she would get up early and go through the house
1:42:41
and dust and vacuum all those rooms.
1:42:46
Then, she would cook breakfast, and breakfast was always, you had
1:42:50
to have biscuits or cornbread.
1:42:56
One meal was biscuits and if you had biscuits then you’d
1:42:59
have cornmeal for dinner.
1:43:02
If you had cornmeal for breakfast or lunch, then you’d have biscuits
1:43:06
for...I was like, oh, my goodness.
1:43:08
I can’t bake a thing.
1:43:12
I don’t know
1:43:14
how to bake anything, and she cooked greens.
1:43:17
They had a little garden area in the back and she had her collards and onions,
1:43:23
green onions and that kind of stuff.
1:43:28
Then, she’d walk to the
1:43:33
grocery, which was like 2, 3 blocks away.
1:43:39
I went with her after the kids were born.
1:43:44
I had the little wheely thing, and we’d go into the grocery store and
1:43:48
I’d start to touch some apples.
1:43:52
The man slaps my hand and tells me you don’t touch.
1:43:55
You don’t know.
1:43:55
You don’t touch.
1:43:56
I said, well, how am I going to buy it if I don’t touch it?
1:44:02
I’ll pick for you.
1:44:03
Oh, my goodness.
1:44:04
Well, I ain’t buying no apples.
1:44:06
Inside the store you could not touch anything, either.
1:44:11
All the groceries boxes, boxed things and packaged things, were behind
1:44:18
a glass or some kind of barrier.
1:44:23
It might not have been glass at that time.
1:44:26
It was just lined up.
1:44:28
He had
1:44:31
a ladder that wheeled along.
1:44:34
You would just tell him what you wanted and he would get up there and
1:44:37
get it and put it on the counter.
1:44:40
I’m like, oh my goodness.
1:44:41
These people.
1:44:42
Because I was used to doing Navy shopping and out here going to my
1:44:46
own grocery store and picking out your stuff, your own stuff you want.
1:44:50
Well, I tried to talk to her that we could, there was Navy shopping we
1:44:54
could do close by in Philadelphia, but she didn’t like that idea.
1:44:58
She wanted to do it the way she’d always done it.
1:45:00
So,
1:45:03
I moved quickly.
1:45:04
Was that not touching just for everybody?
1:45:06
It was for everybody.
1:45:08
Right.
1:45:08
Right.
1:45:11
So, those were just differences I wasn’t used to.
1:45:14
You’d
1:45:17
go to, I went to a dress shop once with my mother-in-law and my husband’s cousin.
1:45:25
We called her big Maureen.
1:45:27
She lived in that walk-through house, too.
1:45:35
I’m going to try on some clothes, and they told me, well, you can’t try it on.
1:45:43
Well, I have to try it on.
1:45:46
They’d hold it up to you.
1:45:47
So, I said, well, I guess this will fit.
1:45:49
Then, I notice a little,
1:45:54
it was kind of a, well, I guess it was a hole where they had
1:45:58
marked where the pocket should go.
1:46:01
I said, oh, well this one has a hole in it.
1:46:03
I don’t want it with a hole in it.
1:46:05
She snatched the thing out of my hand and pushed me out the front door of the store
1:46:13
and told me, you don’t know what you want.
1:46:15
You don’t know how to shop.
1:46:17
I said, oh, excuse me.
1:46:22
I didn’t like Philadelphia at all.
1:46:25
Anyway, after the youngest child was about, maybe, I don’t know.
1:46:32
She wasn’t a year.
1:46:33
She was still an infant.
1:46:35
I got a babysitter, and the oldest one was starting kindergarten.
1:46:41
So, I had a babysitter for little Mo and the baby, and I started teaching
1:46:48
at, I can’t remember the name of the school, but it was different.
1:46:57
It was called the, it was in north Philly and it was called Nicetown-Tioga.
1:47:05
I kept looking for the Nicetown part.
1:47:08
I never did find it.
1:47:10
The school, you could enter one door if you were like a parent
1:47:16
or somebody coming to the office.
1:47:18
You could enter one door at the end of the building.
1:47:22
The kids all had to come in the playground area
1:47:29
or teachers could come in that front door, sign in at the office, then they would
1:47:33
go out the backdoor and meet their class on the playground area behind the school.
1:47:41
Kids never came in the building from the front, that one door.
1:47:45
They had to come in through the back playground area and line up.
1:47:49
The principal would walk back and forth and he would select which
1:47:53
school could take their line and go in the back of the school and go
1:47:59
up, and we were on the third floor.
1:48:02
I had a fifth grade.
1:48:03
Fifth and sixth, I think there were 5 fifth and 5 sixth grades on the top floor.
1:48:12
Third and fourth were on the second floor, and kindergarten and first
1:48:18
were on... first and second, I
1:48:23
guess, were on the first floor.
1:48:27
They didn’t have a cafeteria.
1:48:31
You had to take your whole class to the restroom from the third floor.
1:48:36
You had to go down the stairway into the basement.
1:48:42
Your whole class had to.
1:48:44
That’s how.
1:48:45
I was not used to all that, but that’s what we had to do.
1:48:49
My classroom, all the seats were on runners, like in the olden days.
1:48:57
There were 5 classrooms along the front of the school, and
1:49:02
two had to come from the wing.
1:49:06
If they had an assembly, the middle room was
1:49:17
the platform, or auditorium, stage area.
1:49:23
Their seats were nailed going this way
1:49:29
and mine were, anyway... the kids that came from the side had to
1:49:34
sit in double seats backwards.
1:49:37
It was just really, really, really, really uncomfortable.
1:49:41
My seats were going, my kids stayed in their seats.
1:49:44
We just opened this folding doors between the rooms.
1:49:49
So, this room was the middle.
1:49:52
Then you had one room here that had to sit backwards to look toward the middle.
1:49:58
My room could face the middle.
1:50:00
The room behind me could face, and then the kids that came from that side had
1:50:03
to double up in room x or y or whatever.
1:50:07
It was crazy, but there were some good assemblies that they had there, because
1:50:14
that’s where I learned the song “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
1:50:19
masses yearning to breathe free” that’s written on the Statue of Liberty.
1:50:24
I never heard that song before.
1:50:25
It made me cry every time I heard it.
1:50:31
I taught there one year, and then moved from there to Connecticut.
1:50:38
My classroom in Philadelphia was all Black except for one
1:50:45
little blond-haired White kid.
1:50:48
How was that child treated?
1:50:51
I don’t know if he knew, he was just fine.
1:50:54
Nobody paid any attention.
1:50:56
You know, he just—I never knew of any problem.
1:50:59
He doubled up in the seats with the other kids.
1:51:03
I never noticed any problem with him.
1:51:06
It was just different, really different.
1:51:11
When you were living there, was it in a Black community?
1:51:14
Predominantly Black in south Philly, yes.
1:51:18
But you didn’t particularly feel more comfortable there than any other place?
1:51:22
No.
1:51:23
I think what I was comfortable with my mother-in-law, because I thought she
1:51:28
was a fine person, a wonderful person.
1:51:30
But,
1:51:33
well, her other son, her older son also lived there.
1:51:38
He had a group of guys that would always, the weekend was taken up
1:51:44
with them drinking and smoking and playing cards the whole weekend.
1:51:52
They were not rude.
1:51:58
They were very polite and very, they just kind of treated me like eww.
1:52:02
You know?
1:52:02
You’re just kind of.
1:52:03
You’re not with the group, you know?
1:52:04
And I wasn’t.
1:52:04
I didn’t know what
1:52:08
was going on half the time.
1:52:09
I didn’t know half the time what they—they would talk about things and the way
1:52:14
they would talk I’d miss a lot of their
1:52:19
language, not language...
1:52:21
Jargon?
1:52:21
...yeah, jargon.
1:52:24
But they were always really courteous and I guess, they must have thought of
1:52:29
me as somebody really, really different.
1:52:31
I’m pretty sure they did, because I was a teacher for one thing.
1:52:38
A teacher, goodness.
1:52:39
So,
1:52:43
but it was, they were really gracious to put up with us in such close
1:52:50
quarters for that long, for a year.
1:52:53
Just in terms of your own response to the difference of teaching in a school
1:53:00
that was mainly all Black, as opposed to teaching where it’s all White?
1:53:06
To me, they were just kids.
1:53:09
They were just kids.
1:53:15
I didn’t differentiate.
1:53:16
I talked to them just the way I talked to White kids.
1:53:23
[Break in recording]
1:53:23
So, you were talking about how you were, kind of a comparison, of how it felt for
1:53:30
you to now be living in Philadelphia in a pretty much totally Black community as
1:53:38
opposed to the rest of your experiences where you were living pretty much in White
1:53:45
communities.
1:53:46
As I look back on Philadelphia,
1:53:50
on the street where my mother-in-law lived, there was, I think there were a
1:53:57
couple White families that were there.
1:54:03
South Philadelphia was somewhat mixed.
1:54:07
It had Jewish families that had been there a long time and some Italian families.
1:54:20
I don’t think people...
1:54:23
it seemed people just had their way of operating in that neighborhood,
1:54:29
and they just went about
1:54:34
just was customary for there to be people of color
1:54:40
on the street where they lived, although, I know there were at least
1:54:46
two White families on that block.
1:54:49
While I was there I didn’t spend a lot of time, I walked as far as the park and
1:54:55
the grocery store two or three times, but I didn’t spend a lot of time finding
1:55:01
out about the neighborhood, either.
1:55:05
My school was completely out of south Philly, but it was a
1:55:10
whole different neighborhood.
1:55:14
It’s like, it was a different
1:55:21
economic
1:55:26
area from south Philly, as far as housing and wasn’t as congested.
1:55:32
The houses, they were row houses in a way, but they weren’t as cramped and
1:55:43
connected.
1:55:44
They didn’t divide them into thirds and fourths and stuff as much as they did
1:55:48
in south Philly, it seemed like, to me.
1:55:53
Okay, so then it was Philly and Michigan.
1:55:58
Michigan to Philly.
1:55:58
Michigan, Philly.
1:56:02
Okay, now.
1:56:03
From Philly, we’re going to Connecticut.
1:56:07
Okay.
1:56:09
Just give from Connecticut, just a short—
1:56:10
Okay, Connecticut
1:56:15
was not a very long time.
1:56:17
I taught there one year in a school where there were no
1:56:23
kids of color, no teachers of color, and my daughter was, well, my daughter
1:56:30
was first grade in Connecticut.
1:56:35
My group of kids were just, I don’t know if they knew I was
1:56:40
Black or paid any attention to it.
1:56:42
I didn’t notice.
1:56:44
The staff of teachers, it was a primary school.
1:56:49
It only went up to fifth grade?
1:56:53
Maybe sixth grade.
1:56:54
Fifth grade.
1:56:55
Maybe sixth grade.
1:56:57
Then the kids went to another school.
1:57:01
So, I had fourth and fifth grade combination there.
1:57:08
The kids were just like any other kids that I’ve worked with.
1:57:13
We got along fine.
1:57:14
I didn’t hear any name calling.
1:57:18
My daughter was first grade said she remembers being called four-eyes, because
1:57:22
she had to wear glasses, and people picked on her because of her glasses.
1:57:28
You were living on the Navy base then?
1:57:30
We were living in, yeah, military housing then.
1:57:34
Then, after that, where did you go?
1:57:37
From Connecticut, we went to New Hampshire, and that was for just one
1:57:44
year, and I taught a fifth grade.
1:57:49
I took over a class like middle of the year in New Hampshire.
1:57:56
Then New Hampshire to?
1:57:58
Portland.
1:57:59
To Portland.
1:57:59
Back to Portland.
1:57:59
Okay, so now let’s get to Portland.
1:58:01
So, was your husband transferred?
1:58:04
No.
1:58:04
So then, that’s...
1:58:05
That’s where we split.
1:58:07
Okay.
1:58:08
I left him.
1:58:09
Alright.
1:58:09
It was not going well.
1:58:13
I came back to Portland, back home.
1:58:16
With the children.
1:58:16
With the children.
1:58:17
Three by now?
1:58:18
Right.
1:58:20
One of them had started kindergarten, Mo had started kindergarten in New Hampshire.
1:58:26
So, Gerri was
1:58:31
in fourth grade I think?
1:58:33
Or fifth grade?
1:58:36
I can’t remember exactly.
1:58:41
Ginny started kindergarten here.
1:58:50
That’s where their schooling all mostly took place.
1:58:56
I
1:58:59
started teaching, let’s see, what was my first assignment when I got back here?
1:59:09
Why can’t I remember that?
1:59:17
When I came back to Portland?
1:59:18
I can’t see where I was?
1:59:21
We’ll get to that.
1:59:22
So, where did you, so you came back here.
1:59:25
Where did you go to live?
1:59:27
How did you find your housing?
1:59:28
Okay.
1:59:29
That’s an interesting little bit of a story.
1:59:34
When I left Portland and made all those, and came back to, I usually
1:59:40
came back to Portland every year for the summer for a few weeks with the
1:59:45
kids when they were little, but when we came back from New Hampshire,
1:59:51
well, in fact, one visit I came back from, it must have been Connecticut then, and
1:59:57
the house, which was an empty lot next to my mom’s house where the chicken yard was.
2:00:04
So, that’s here.
2:00:05
That is in Portland.
2:00:07
Next to Mom’s house was our chicken yard.
2:00:11
The chicken yard had been, they sold the property and some people
2:00:16
built a house in our chicken yard.
2:00:22
It was a young couple with a couple of kids.
2:00:25
Then, when I came back the following year and I was moving back to
2:00:28
Portland, I moved into Mom’s house.
2:00:31
I didn’t move my furniture or anything, but I just stayed at Mom’s house and I was
2:00:34
going to locate a place, a house to stay.
2:00:39
So, where was your mother’s house?
2:00:41
Right next door.
2:00:43
Okay, that’s what I’m—yes.
2:00:44
Right.
2:00:44
Oh, I did not say that initially, didn’t I?
2:00:47
That’s what we were interested in.
2:00:50
So, the point is this place where we are sitting is your original place?
2:00:55
It’s the chicken yard.
2:00:56
And this was the chicken yard, and that’s your mom’s?
2:01:01
Mom’s house was next door.
2:01:02
Do you still own that house?
2:01:03
I don’t own that house, but my grandnephews are in it.
2:01:10
And they own
2:01:13
it?
2:01:13
It turned out that my brother took that property, my mom’s house, and there’s
2:01:18
two lots on the other side, which was just open yard where Mom had equipment
2:01:26
for her foster kids and everything.
2:01:28
Anyway, my brother owned that property, and I own the property in Orchards,
2:01:35
which was my grandfather’s house.
2:01:40
So, we split the property when parents were gone and not able to be out there
2:01:47
and take care of the property anymore.
2:01:50
So, the house next to my mom’s house, which was the chicken yard, was
2:01:58
owned by a couple and their children when my folks sold the property.
2:02:04
Then, I don’t know what happened to the family that were living
2:02:10
in the little house that they had built, but they disappeared
2:02:13
and then the house was available.
2:02:17
So, I bought it.
2:02:20
That’s?
2:02:20
This house.
2:02:21
This house.
2:02:22
Right.
2:02:23
Which had been
2:02:27
the chicken yard.
2:02:27
The chicken yard.
2:02:28
I live in the chicken yard [laughs] . Right.
2:02:31
You’re saying your nephews live next door?
2:02:33
Right.
2:02:38
They or their father or mother own that land?
2:02:42
The owners are now deceased.
2:02:44
My brother’s deceased, and his son is deceased.
2:02:50
It’s son’s children that now, with all their hundreds of
2:02:58
people in and out of the house.
2:03:00
I don’t know.
2:03:02
But, it’s my grandnephew who is responsible for the house.
2:03:08
So, it’s still in the family.
2:03:10
Then, this is the land that was in your family for a long time, but
2:03:14
somebody else was living in it.
2:03:16
Then you bought the house.
2:03:17
Right.
2:03:17
Bought it from them.
2:03:19
So, now you’re back.
2:03:20
I’m back home.
2:03:21
Back home.
2:03:23
[Laughs] Right next to home.
2:03:24
In the chicken yard, and you have no chickens.
2:03:27
I don’t have any chickens, thank you very much [laughs]
2:03:31
. Chickens are a mess [laughs]
2:03:40
. Okay, so.
2:03:40
Now tell us about this life now that you were having.
2:03:44
Okay, back in the house, or the chicken yard.
2:03:49
That’s where the kids grew up and they went to the local schools.
2:03:53
The school I attended, the Lents school that I attended, was torn down, the old
2:03:59
wooden, three-story wooden building.
2:04:01
The school, the rebuilt school was just across the street from Mom’s house.
2:04:10
They just walked up the block across the street and they were in their school.
2:04:16
All three kids went to the new Lents school, that I had
2:04:22
gone to the old Lents school.
2:04:27
Then they all went to the high school that was built walking distance
2:04:33
about, probably about 6 blocks away.
2:04:38
Marshall High School was one of the new Portland schools that was built.
2:04:43
They all attended that school, graduated from that school.
2:04:47
Why did you want to come back here in this part of Portland?
2:04:53
I’m not sure if I gave it any thought except for convenience.
2:05:00
My folks were, all their foster kids were gone.
2:05:09
They were there.
2:05:10
They were getting older.
2:05:13
Well, when my kids were little, though, Mom was still cooking
2:05:18
every day and she loved to cook.
2:05:19
You couldn’t
2:05:24
give kids enough food.
2:05:25
She made sure that they had enough food.
2:05:28
It was convenient in the house next door.
2:05:31
I thought why not?
2:05:36
I guess it was a good buy, as I think about it, because it had been abandoned.
2:05:42
The yard was a total mess.
2:05:44
I thought, well, I’ll just work on the yard and I made some diagrams
2:05:51
for where to put the trees, and I just went crazy fixing up the yard
2:05:58
and being next door to parents.
2:06:02
So, I think it was just a matter of convenience, and so every evening kids
2:06:07
coming home from school had snacks and care and I’m working and didn’t
2:06:13
have to worry about them, because...
2:06:15
Because Grandma was...
2:06:16
Ma was taking care of them, and she loved to cook and feed kids.
2:06:21
So that was convenience.
2:06:26
Then you were teaching?
2:06:30
Mm-hmm.
2:06:32
Then what?
2:06:33
Oh, well, before we do that, so now compare your teaching that you
2:06:38
were doing back here in Portland and what were those experiences and
2:06:44
how do they compare to your others?
2:06:47
All of them were wonderful, really.
2:06:52
The principal of the first school where I taught when I came back
2:06:56
interviewed me in this room.
2:07:00
It was December.
2:07:02
So,
2:07:05
when I came back at first, I didn’t start teaching.
2:07:09
I think that’s when I worked for a short time as a library aid at, it
2:07:18
was a school in north Portland, a boy’s elementary school.
2:07:23
It was almost entirely Black, but it was a school that was going downhill.
2:07:32
Teachers were leaving the school all the time.
2:07:36
The library was within walking distance of that school, and so
2:07:43
I don’t know how I got connected with, I think through the kids coming into
2:07:47
the library or something, I knew about this school and that the principal,
2:07:53
that they were looking for a teacher.
2:07:56
So, I applied, of course, for a teaching job.
2:08:00
I
2:08:05
guess the way it happens is if a principal has a vacancy in his school, or her
2:08:11
school, it was mostly his school then,
2:08:16
they go to the central office and they put in a request for a teacher.
2:08:22
Then, if you want a job, then you go to the central office and you put in your
2:08:29
application for a teaching position.
2:08:31
Somehow those two things came together: the request for a
2:08:35
teacher and a request for a job.
2:08:37
The principal of the school which was just across the street
2:08:42
practically from the library,
2:08:48
he found out where I lived and what I was doing in the library.
2:08:53
I knew some
2:08:56
of the kids that attended the school.
2:09:00
Somehow, he interviewed me.
2:09:03
I remember it was a snowy day in December and he drove through the snow and we had
2:09:10
the interview and he put in a request for me to accept the job that was open.
2:09:19
So, it was in December and so
2:09:22
they
2:09:27
would have vacation almost all of January, or part of January,
2:09:32
end of December and into January.
2:09:33
I started the first of January right after the spring, the
2:09:39
summer, no, Christmas break is what
2:09:46
it was.
2:09:46
That was, let’s see... I taught there, I think 2 years.
2:09:54
Then, I started moving into different assignments.
2:09:59
What were differences in the different schools and the neighborhoods?
2:10:05
Well, the boy’s school here in Portland,
2:10:11
like if I compared it with the last school where I had been in New
2:10:14
Hampshire, the kids in New Hampshire, a lot of them were military kids.
2:10:21
It was not on a military base.
2:10:23
It was in the town of New Hampshire, Portsmouth, but a
2:10:28
lot of the kids were military kids, and I found out that, and also the kids in
2:10:35
Connecticut were almost all military kids, and they had been, many of them
2:10:42
had been to many places in the world.
2:10:43
They had traveled.
2:10:51
They were just good students.
2:10:54
They knew how to use the library, how to do research and all that kind of thing.
2:10:58
When I came back here, boys was in a part of Portland that was
2:11:08
not perceived as worth very much.
2:11:13
The kids, the school was kind of, was a good looking school.
2:11:20
It was just not well-thought of, and the people in the neighborhood, the
2:11:23
neighborhood was kind of going downhill.
2:11:26
People weren’t keeping their houses up.
2:11:31
Kids, they weren’t getting the best teachers.
2:11:36
There were teachers there that were really good and had been there
2:11:39
for quite a while, but most of them were in the primary grades.
2:11:43
Where they were having trouble with keeping teachers was
2:11:46
from about fifth grade up.
2:11:49
Well, I got a fifth grade class.
2:11:52
I got a class where when I took over the classroom it’s in
2:11:55
December, end of December, January.
2:12:01
The kids, okay, I’d get in the classroom and I said, okay
2:12:06
everybody open your books.
2:12:09
I don’t know whether it was language arts or social studies or whatever.
2:12:14
They said, we don’t have any books.
2:12:17
I said, you don’t have any books?
2:12:19
Where are your books?
2:12:22
Our teacher took our books away.
2:12:25
I said, your teacher took your books away why?
2:12:28
You have to have books.
2:12:30
You’re in a classroom.
2:12:31
You have to have books.
2:12:32
You have to read stuff and write stuff out of the book.
2:12:36
Well, because we were writing in our books, drawing in our books.
2:12:39
I said, why are you drawing in your books?
2:12:41
You got art paper.
2:12:42
You draw on your art paper.
2:12:43
You don’t draw on the—no,
2:12:47
he took our books away because we’re drawing on them.
2:12:48
I said, what are you drawing in your books?
2:12:53
He said, afros.
2:12:54
They were drawing afros on every picture that had a head in the picture.
2:13:02
So, the teacher took away their books.
2:13:04
I said, well, listen.
2:13:05
Your books are coming back.
2:13:07
You’re not going to draw in them.
2:13:09
You’re going to have art paper and if you can’t draw on the art paper,
2:13:13
then I guess you’re not going to draw.
2:13:15
I don’t want to see not one drawing or writing or any—that is
2:13:20
called destroying, destructive.
2:13:24
You cannot do that and you will not do that.
2:13:27
Everybody got that clear?
2:13:30
I was kind of a mean teacher.
2:13:32
I was mean.
2:13:33
You might say I was firm.
2:13:35
I basically was mean.
2:13:37
So, got their books back.
2:13:40
There was no more drawing on the books, but everybody was into the era of afros.
2:13:47
I didn’t realize what effect that was having on kids.
2:13:52
It took me a long time to realize how important it was that they try to see
2:13:58
themselves in the pictures that they had in their textbooks, which they did
2:14:03
not see anything relative to themselves.
2:14:06
So, they were going to put themselves in the book.
2:14:09
It took me a long time to realize that.
2:14:13
Anyway, we got the books back.
2:14:18
The school was working very hard to get the community to work with them.
2:14:22
It was the era of Black Power and many of the kids were going to the
2:14:31
breakfast programs that were being established for neighborhood kids
2:14:36
and they were learning, you know, Whitey’s no good and Black Power.
2:14:45
I wasn’t at that place.
2:14:47
I had not gotten there and did not intend to get there, because
2:14:55
I was not in the neighborhood where kids and their parents were being
2:15:03
mistreated and not understood and not receiving the kinds of—and parents
2:15:11
didn’t come to the school and teachers didn’t go to the home, and that
2:15:15
was one of the first things I did.
2:15:18
I said, well, you know, I guess your mother needs to know that
2:15:21
you did x, y, and z, so I will be at your house this afternoon.
2:15:25
Oh, no.
2:15:25
Don’t come to our—oh, I’ll be there.
2:15:29
At the same time I took over that classroom, a White girl who became one
2:15:35
of my best friends, who had trained to be a nun, had taken over the fifth
2:15:40
grade across the hall, and she was not afraid to go to those kids’ parents.
2:15:46
She’d march right down to their homes and sit down and talk.
2:15:50
I’m
2:15:52
a human being.
2:15:53
Your kids are human.
2:15:54
We’re there to teach them.
2:15:56
We’re not trying to make them evil.
2:16:01
We’re not trying to make them mad.
2:16:03
We’re not trying to hurt them or take things away.
2:16:05
We’re trying to teach them what they need for the next grade and
2:16:08
for the next year and whatever.
2:16:13
That was quite, that was a new experience.
2:16:16
A lot of visitations with homes and families.
2:16:22
So, I moved from fifth grade to seventh, eighth, and then I started a
2:16:29
reading, I was in charge of the reading.
2:16:32
They started a new program in reading where they wanted kids
2:16:35
to do speed reading and stuff.
2:16:38
So, then,
2:16:44
this school was one that, I mean, they really did a lot.
2:16:47
They had a parent-teacher retreat.
2:16:54
We went up to [recording cuts off]
