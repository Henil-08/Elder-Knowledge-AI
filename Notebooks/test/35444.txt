00:01
It is May 9.
00:03
We are interviewing Kay Toran: K-a-y, Toran: T-o-r-a-n in Portland, Oregon.
00:15
Kay, how are old are you?
00:16
[Laughs] I didn’t know you were going to start with that.
00:20
Okay, I’m sorry [laughs] . I’m 76 years of age.
00:25
Okay.
00:29
Now, we’ll start the actual interviewing.
00:31
Okay.
00:32
Basically, what I want to do is, I will start with the beginning
00:37
and we’ll work up to now.
00:40
So, would you like to start out with telling me about where you were born and
00:46
where you grew up and go through where you lived at first, then went to school?
00:55
Just kind of go step by step.
00:57
Surely, yes.
00:58
My pleasure.
00:59
I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, to Ben and Mary Rose Steen.
01:05
My maiden name is Steen.
01:07
My parents migrated to the Northwest when I was 11 months of age and actually
01:14
moved into Vancouver, Washington, in the Bagley Downs projects.
01:18
My mom graduated from the Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty in
01:23
Birmingham, Alabama, so she immediately opened a salon in Vancouver.
01:27
My dad worked as a welder in the Kaiser shipyard.
01:30
After about 3 years we moved into Portland, Oregon, and I was
01:34
raised in northeast Portland.
01:39
My mom continued with her business, a beauty salon, and my dad, after he
01:44
left the shipyard was working as a janitor with Federal Reserve Bank.
01:48
My childhood was in northeast Portland, northeast Hancock, which was
01:51
almost all Black, as a neighborhood.
01:54
We had a couple of white families.
01:57
It was one of those neighborhoods that everyone got along.
01:59
Everyone knew each other and all the other parents on the block
02:03
assumed some responsibility of raising all the kids on the block.
02:06
It was a very close-knit community, close-knit neighborhood, probably made
02:12
even closer because of my mom’s business.
02:15
Many of the African American women came to my mom’s beauty salon.
02:21
It seemed to me we knew everyone and everyone knew us.
02:25
We also had the majority of our neighborhood going to the same church,
02:29
which was Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, which was a couple of blocks away.
02:35
My childhood was just one that was happy.
02:39
We probably we were like all kids, we got in enough trouble so that when we did get
02:45
into trouble the neighbors would call our parents and say I’ll tell you what Kay,
02:49
Gloria, and Ben and Caroline were doing that they shouldn’t have been doing.
02:52
Like I said, there was this cooperative parenting going on in our neighborhood.
02:58
I, at that time, really wanted to, in my adulthood in Los Angeles and Hollywood,
03:05
because I wanted to be a dancer.
03:08
So, my very best girlfriend, Darilynne and I, we used to choreograph dances
03:13
and then call all the neighbors to sit on our porches as we
03:17
danced up and down Hancock Street.
03:19
My older sister participated probably for a couple of years
03:22
and then she was done with us.
03:24
But at the time she participated we called ourselves the Brooksadines, and
03:29
we could tap dance and we could sing and we could perform the Hollywood musicals
03:35
better than anybody in Hollywood.
03:38
My childhood really was a happy childhood, and I had wonderful parents who were
03:42
all very supportive of us as children.
03:45
They came out of the south.
03:46
They were very realistic about the fact that if we wanted to “be successful,” and
03:51
I’d put that in quotes, that we had to assume responsibility for our own destiny.
03:55
Education was very important to them and to us.
03:59
They really wanted to make sure that we were doing what we needed
04:02
to do to learn, to be productive, and to be able to be successful
04:07
in our school, in our education.
04:11
I went to predominantly Black grade schools, first Holladay then Eliot
04:15
Grade School in northeast Portland.
04:17
The first experience I really had with Whites in Portland was when
04:22
I went to Washington High School, which was predominantly White.
04:26
For whatever reason, while we were in high school, we really had a
04:32
very supportive school environment.
04:37
I don’t recall any incidents that were related to race.
04:41
We had a very successful football team at the time.
04:43
That may have been part of it is that people wanted to know
04:47
students from Washington High School, because we had a successful
04:52
Portland interscholastic league.
04:55
Also, I was very, at a very early age interested in governance.
05:01
I was the student body president at the Eliot Grade School when I was in the
05:04
7th grade, and when I went to Washington High School, my brother had also been
05:09
very interested in governance, but when I got to Washington High School I
05:12
immediately wanted to “run for office” [air quotes gesture] we called it, so
05:15
I wanted to be the class representative for the student government. I did
05:20
not win, but it didn’t deter me.
05:23
My sophomore year I decided maybe the way to get into student governance
05:27
was to try out for junior rally, and I tried out for junior rally.
05:32
Again, I liked to dance and liked to sing.
05:35
I tried out for being a member of the junior rally squad and won.
05:40
That provided me with the kind of “popularity” [air quotes gesture]
05:43
that allowed me at the end of my sophomore year to run for a
05:46
position for student governance.
05:50
Can you tell a little bit more about what student rally is?
05:52
Right, the rally squad.
05:54
Those were the cheerleaders.
05:56
That’s what we called them then, the cheerleaders that supported the junior
06:00
varsity team at Washington High School.
06:02
We would travel with the team to the games.
06:05
We would be the ones leading the cheering and the support for the
06:10
team of the students that were there.
06:13
There were 6 of us, 6 members who were on the junior rally squad.
06:19
That gave me a certain kind of visibility, so the next time that I
06:23
ran for a governance position, I won.
06:27
I really liked the idea of being able to think about how to make the school better.
06:33
It just sort of was in my blood.
06:37
From that position for the next 2 and a half years at Washington High School,
06:42
every time I had an opportunity to run for one of the offices that was a part
06:46
of the governing structure, I did.
06:48
My senior year was one that was really a profound experience for me.
06:53
I ran for president of the girl’s league.
06:56
That was a girl’s governance organization at Washington High School, and I one.
07:03
In talking to the dean, I guess we call him the dean of students,
07:09
Mrs. Withicomb [shakes head] , Ms. Withicomb wasn’t married.
07:11
Ms. Withicomb said you ought to try running for the president
07:16
of the state girl’s league.
07:18
They have a position and what they do was plan a state conference
07:23
at the end of the senior year.
07:26
At the end of my junior year I was nominated to run for that position,
07:33
the “convention” [air quotes gesture] , if you will. It’s in Salem, Oregon.
07:37
I prepared my speech.
07:38
To this day, I don’t know why I felt so uncomfortable doing this, but
07:42
I had to give my speech to all the girls that were there from all over
07:46
the state to elect a new president for girls league state, and I won.
07:52
That told me a lot about, again, positioning yourself to be able to
07:57
present your message well, being confident in presenting that message,
08:03
and then saying what people thought.
08:07
Ms. Withicomb said she was shocked.
08:10
She drove us to Salem and she drove us home.
08:12
She said, I’m just shocked, Kay, that you won.
08:15
I had no idea you would win.
08:16
She says, I just wanted you to have that experience.
08:19
I’m not sure what really motivated her or why she didn’t think I would win.
08:24
I have no idea.
08:25
But I will never forget that messaging on the way back to Portland,
08:30
which kind of surprised me because she had encouraged me to run.
08:33
If she really didn’t think I would win, then why did she encourage me to run.
08:37
Maybe it was just what she said.
08:38
She wanted me to have that experience.
08:40
Anyway, my high school years were really quite wonderful.
08:47
I still have fond memories.
08:49
I still, on occasion, have dinner with some of my classmates
08:53
from Washington High School.
08:55
I graduated in 1960, so I think that’s pretty remarkable that we continue
08:59
to have those relationships today.
09:01
Those are relations with White people?
09:04
Yes.
09:06
Most of my African American friends do not live in Portland, even if they—well, we
09:14
don’t have a relationship, but I do with the White friends that stayed in Portland.
09:19
Yeah, but they’re White.
09:20
Exactly.
09:21
I’ve got one friend, African American male who I will see probably twice a
09:26
year, where we’ll have dinner together.
09:27
Other than that, most of the close friends that I have that are African
09:30
American do not live in Portland.
09:34
Is there a reason for that?
09:36
Probably.
09:38
Do I know what that reason is?
09:39
I think most of my friends left Portland shortly after high school.
09:44
Most of them did not go directly to college.
09:47
I did.
09:49
I think probably they were looking for something different than
09:53
what they had here in Portland.
09:55
I felt that way when I was ready to go to college.
09:58
I really wanted to go to Howard University.
10:00
The reason I wanted to go to Howard University is that I really
10:03
wanted an experience that was predominantly Black of young people
10:08
pursuing their higher education.
10:10
The reason I didn’t do that—I applied—but the reason I didn’t do
10:13
it is my mom and dad really felt like I needed to have a “smaller” [air
10:18
quote gesture] experience here before going off to a really big university.
10:23
So, after conversation with them, and I think they had already made a decision,
10:28
I made a decision to apply to the University of Portland and was admitted.
10:33
A Catholic university, small university, faith-based university.
10:36
My parents were deeply, deeply, deeply religious.
10:39
This probably met all of the criteria they had for a “safe” [air quote gesture]
10:43
environment for their daughter, who at that point in time really didn’t, I
10:48
didn’t have a lot of broader experiences in the larger world. Retrospectively, it
10:57
was probably a really good decision that they pushed me that direction, encouraged
11:01
me to go that direction. At the time, I said two years at the University of
11:04
Portland, then I’m going to Howard.
11:05
I really did feel like I wanted to have this experience that was
11:10
predominantly African American, or Black is what we called it at the time.
11:14
Again, the University of Portland, I had a wonderful experience.
11:17
I had a wonderful time there.
11:19
Again, I ran for “cheerleader” [air quote gesture] the moment I got on campus.
11:23
I was a cheerleader my freshman year.
11:26
I loved my classes.
11:28
I loved the fact that I had to minor in philosophy, and that was the
11:31
first time that I had an exposure to philosophy and any exposure to—most of
11:38
my philosophy professors were priests—any exposure to being able to debate with
11:44
somebody who was really well-versed and grounded in philosophy and religion.
11:50
And they were very open to the debate.
11:52
It wasn’t like it was doctrinaire and I had to believe one thing or another.
11:58
If I was going to raise a question, they really did expect me to have enough
12:05
data and information and knowledge to be able to debate it.
12:08
You couldn’t debate from emotion.
12:09
I loved that.
12:11
I love that today.
12:13
I love to sit down with someone and just really go, you know, really
12:19
have that opportunity to go person to person about what we believe,
12:23
what we think, and why we think it.
12:25
I do that around politics today.
12:28
My experience at the University of Portland was rich.
12:30
It was challenging.
12:31
It was fun.
12:34
I felt academically successful when I graduated.
12:37
I graduated within 4 years.
12:39
I met my first husband there, and he drafted and he was stationed in Germany.
12:46
So my first experience outside of Portland, Oregon, as a young adult
12:51
was living in Germany with my husband.
12:54
My agreement with him, and my parents, was that if I’m going to Germany
12:59
to live then we must live off-base.
13:02
I didn’t want an American experience in Germany.
13:05
We lived in Wortham, Germany for just under a year.
13:08
Again, with one of the more challenging experiences, because I didn’t know German.
13:14
By the time I got there, my husband Roy did speak probably conversational
13:19
German which was helpful.
13:22
Both of us were kind of struggling with the language.
13:24
By living off-base, Herr and Frau Klein, our landlords, spoke very little English.
13:31
The struggle was being able to communicate with them to get a rich experience
13:35
about what Germany was going to be for us and what Germany had been for them.
13:40
I’m real pleased to say after 4 or 5 months there and on occasion having
13:47
coffee and pastry with them, we were able to ask some hard questions.
13:54
The hardest question I remember asking the Kleins was how did Nazi Germany happen?
13:59
There was a little stuttering, a little uncomfortableness with that,
14:05
but Herr Klein said, you always trust your leaders but you shouldn’t.
14:11
I remember that to this day.
14:14
It’s a real powerful message.
14:17
You always trust your leaders, but you shouldn’t.
14:20
That’s all he would say.
14:21
That’s all they would talk about.
14:24
I knew that Nazi Germany was very uncomfortable for most of the Germans
14:27
then and now, because it could happen again is the fear that all of us have,
14:34
that what was wrong with Germany then, that didn’t stop a very ugly movement.
14:40
If those barriers were not there then, are there not the barriers
14:45
that need to be in place to prevent that from happening again?
14:48
Wherever.
14:49
Rwanda’s probably a good example of that.
14:51
[Break in recording]
14:52
Okay, as I mentioned right after graduating from the University of
14:57
Portland, I immediately moved to Germany, Wortham, Germany, and Roy and
15:02
I lived there for just under a year before he was transferred back and then
15:06
eventually discharged from the Army.
15:09
He was a draftee.
15:11
We decided to live in Portland, Oregon.
15:14
I did want to ask you one question about Germany.
15:19
Did you feel uncomfortable or whatever, as being an African American in Germany?
15:26
No, I did not.
15:27
I did not feel uncomfortable being in Wortham, and I think the reason for that
15:31
is that the military base was there and there were a number of African American
15:35
soldiers that were in the community.
15:38
I think there was a receptivity
15:41
to the African Americans because of the military, because there were lots
15:47
of soldiers and it wasn’t uncommon for the Germans to see us around.
15:51
I developed a pretty wonderful close relationship with the
15:55
Kleins and they were my anchor.
15:57
They were my parents away from the United States of America.
16:00
I think because there was a level of comfort with the Germans and the soldiers
16:07
that were in the Army and the base and because we have this relationship with the
16:11
Kleins, I didn’t feel uncomfortable there.
16:16
When we socialized, if we weren’t in a restaurant in downtown Wortham, we were
16:20
on the base, and so of course there was, like being in the United States of
16:24
America and it was pretty supportive.
16:29
Okay, so now you came back to Portland.
16:33
Yes.
16:33
I came back to Portland and made the decision with my husband that
16:35
we were going to live in Portland.
16:38
I wanted to mention that part of my reason for coming back to Portland is that I
16:42
really wanted to be closer to my parents.
16:46
I came from a family of 4 children.
16:49
My brother was the oldest.
16:50
I have an older sister and a younger sister, and of course my mom and my dad.
16:55
We were very close-knit.
16:56
I remember growing up my mom and dad, who were very adventurous, obviously
17:01
they were adventurous to make the decision to move from Birmingham
17:04
3,000 miles away to the northwest.
17:07
While we were growing up they always made a point of going back to Birmingham
17:11
so that we would have some relationship with the family that they left behind.
17:15
They also would travel by automobile to other places.
17:18
We went to Mexico.
17:19
We went to Canada.
17:20
We went to California and other states within the United States of America.
17:25
One of the things my mom used to say, not my dad but my mom used to say the
17:29
reason we have four children is that we want you to live in the four corners of
17:34
the world, and we will come to visit you.
17:36
We want to see the four corners of the world.
17:38
That’s great, glamorous, and quite wonderful, yes.
17:42
So, when my brother moved to New York City, the oldest of the
17:45
four, my mom was so freaked out.
17:48
How could he move so far away from home!
17:51
It was almost hilarious, because on one conceptual level the idea of being
17:56
able to travel abroad was exciting to them, but when the reality hit them
18:01
that my brother was going to be 3,000 away from home, my mom, I don’t think
18:05
this was so true of my dad, but my mom was not real comfortable with it.
18:08
It was easy for me to make the decision to come back to Portland.
18:11
Roy loved Portland.
18:12
He was from New York City, my husband.
18:14
He loved the whole concept of a smaller community where people
18:18
knew each other, where people were supportive of each other.
18:20
That was an easy decision to make.
18:24
Portland was beginning to change.
18:25
That was at the time when the Civil Rights Movement was starting.
18:28
I was very active in the Civil Rights Movement from a Portland base,
18:33
was very active about advocating for political and policy changes.
18:41
It just seemed to me that when I was growing up when we saw all those
18:46
businesses along northeast Broadway where there were no-colored-allowed signs in the
18:51
windows that that had and needed to stop.
18:54
Even in Germany, where they had gone through probably one of the worst
18:59
histories in terms of the inability to live with people who were different,
19:03
you didn’t see those kinds of signage, you didn’t see that kind of signage.
19:07
You didn’t see places where you were restricted to go.
19:11
But here in Portland, along northeast Broadway, along Union Avenue, which
19:16
is now Martin Luther King, there were establishments that you could not go into
19:20
if you were “colored” [air quote gesture] was the language we used at the time.
19:24
It was very easy for me, with my kind of
19:32
government, I mean my activist nature to get involved in the Civil Rights Movement
19:37
here in the United States of America.
19:38
Can you tell us about that in detail?
19:40
Sure I was part of the “they got” [air quote gesture] youth group that
19:43
would organize and do the marches and the demonstrations in downtown
19:49
Portland, and I was a part of that.
19:51
I also was a part of writing letters.
19:53
I also was a part of signing petitions.
19:56
Also, you know, sending notes of encouragement to Dr. Martin Luther King.
20:01
It was my way of lending my voice to a movement that I believe was very
20:06
important, and I knew it was important to my parents who really did believe
20:11
that the barriers that were in the place of African Americans, Black Americans,
20:16
or colored, if you will, was racism.
20:19
It wasn’t that we couldn’t learn.
20:22
It wasn’t that we didn’t know how to live.
20:25
It wasn’t that we didn’t aspire to a better life.
20:30
It was one of the isms.
20:32
One of the things my parents said to all four of us is that what you need to
20:36
understand is that you cannot control anyone else, but you can control yourself.
20:41
What they meant by that, is you invest in your education.
20:45
You put the knowledge you need in your head.
20:48
You will be able to figure out a way to navigate around those
20:52
obstacles that you cannot control.
20:54
You cannot control someone else’s behavior, but you can certain control
20:57
how you respond to it, which is the message that we heard day in and
21:01
day out as children, either because of the way they lived their lives
21:05
or because of a direct message.
21:07
You control yourself.
21:09
You control what you do with your life.
21:11
You control your choices.
21:13
That’s what you can do to be in control of your destiny.
21:17
They were adamant.
21:19
That generation of adults were that way.
21:21
You got the same message wherever you went from those other parents who came
21:27
out of the south, the other parents who came from Birmingham, Alabama.
21:29
It was the same thing.
21:30
You can control yourself.
21:31
You can’t control someone else, so you invest in yourself.
21:35
You invest in yourself and you will be able to control your destiny.
21:40
It was probably cool to be in the Civil Rights Movement because everybody was.
21:46
I think most of us were real serious about the movement because we knew
21:50
that at the end of the day it had every possibility of helping to improve our
21:55
lifestyle and allow doors to be opened that were closed to us in the past.
22:01
Can you tell us some specific examples of demonstrating or particular
22:08
activities, how you did it, what happened, what responses were around you?
22:17
Yeah.
22:18
Probably being able to describe the responses is a little challenging.
22:24
I can remember when the March on Washington was happening in 1963.
22:29
There was a similar kind of march in Portland.
22:31
At that time, it was over on the Williams Avenue Park, the park that was
22:37
between Williams Avenue and Vancouver.
22:40
My memory is that there were several marches in downtown Portland.
22:44
Some of them were not just focused on Civil Rights.
22:46
Some of them were focused on protests against the war, the Vietnam War.
22:51
You know, there’d be media coverage.
22:52
You’d read about it in the newspaper, but it’s hard for me to articulate
22:56
because I’m not sure I do know what was the impact on people who were
22:59
living here in Portland when they would either see it, hear it, or read it.
23:02
I don’t really know.
23:04
All I know is as I got older when I had some other opportunities, for example
23:09
to work for the governor of the state, I really felt that part of the reason
23:13
that was an option for me was because of all the activity that had happened
23:18
in the form of demonstrations, letter writing, being invited to be part of
23:26
television shows where you talked about the fact that we really did want to see
23:31
public accommodation for all people and that we really wanted equal opportunity,
23:38
educational opportunities for all people.
23:40
I knew there was a relationship, but I couldn’t tell you exactly
23:43
how people felt about it.
23:48
So, continue, you were going to tell us some more about your childhood and...
23:55
Right.
23:55
I came from a family of 6—my mom and my dad and the four children.
23:58
My brother was the oldest of the four and I had an older sister, who is
24:02
2 years older than I, and a younger sister who is four years younger
24:06
than I. My brother is deceased.
24:08
My mom and dad are deceased.
24:09
So, it’s now just the 3 of us.
24:12
As I said, we were a close-knit family.
24:15
I came from a highly religious family.
24:17
Education was a high value.
24:21
Excellence was a high value.
24:23
Excellence in everything.
24:24
Excellence in terms of how we approached our educational studies, how we dressed.
24:30
My mom, because she was in the beauty business, whenever she would take the
24:34
3 daughters downtown we had to dress.
24:37
I tell that to people now that when we would go downtown Portland, usually on
24:40
the bus, my mom would say get your gloves.
24:43
We would have our white gloves.
24:44
We would have our dresses.
24:45
We never wore pants, well, peddle-pushers we called them at
24:49
the time in downtown Portland.
24:50
We were always dressed.
24:52
I always had this feeling like Mom wanted people to know that we were the daughters
24:57
of Mrs. Steen, the beauty salon owner.
25:01
That was true with all of the families that were in our neighborhood.
25:08
By today’s standards, it was a sophisticated neighborhood.
25:11
You dressed to go to church.
25:12
You dressed to go to downtown Portland.
25:14
You dressed to go to school.
25:17
The casualness came when you were playing on the weekend.
25:20
That was how we were raised.
25:24
We were raised width manners and to be polite.
25:26
To this day, people in my generation would never use profanity in front of
25:33
somebody older, if they use it at all.
25:36
That was because it was so prohibited in terms of how you relate to
25:40
each other and how you relate to older people and older people.
25:43
Older people, I think, were probably were real true role models in terms
25:46
of how to live your life and how to be who they thought we needed to be.
25:52
It was a supportive and cohesive neighborhood that I grew up in.
25:58
I think those values, I think how we lived our lives dictate how I
26:04
behave today, how I treat people in the workforce, how I treat people
26:07
that I work with and certainly how I have tried to raise my children.
26:11
I was going to ask you, then, to go, in terms of raising your children to describe
26:16
more about that linkage, and what system did you use in raising your children?
26:23
Right, again, it was modeling for one but certainly teaching them that respect
26:31
of others and self was absolutely key if you were to be successful in this world.
26:37
Respect of yourself by making sure that you assume responsibility for educating
26:42
yourself, not only formally in public education but also in terms of your own
26:46
personal choices, like making sure that you are a reader, making sure that you
26:51
understand the value and the contribution the library will have for you.
26:57
Certainly treating your friends with respect, absolutely essential treating
27:03
adults and older people with respect.
27:07
That was just a bottom line in our family and bottom line with my children.
27:11
They’re that way today.
27:13
My son and my daughter are extraordinarily respectful people.
27:18
They have their aspirations, like any other young person.
27:23
They’ve had their ups and their downs, but they’ve always been focused in terms
27:27
of making sure that they were living their lives in such a way that they
27:32
could take care of themselves, that they could take care of their children, and
27:36
that they took care and had respect for their fellow members of our society.
27:43
I taught them to be donors on some level, whether it was formally as making a
27:50
donation to an organization or making a contribution through volunteerism.
27:56
One of the things that really impressed me about my son is that, I don’t know if
27:59
he still does this, but up until a few years ago Christmas for him meant going
28:04
downtown and volunteering for someone someplace before you had Christmas dinner.
28:09
He did that not because I encouraged him to do it or told him to do
28:12
it or suggested that he do it.
28:14
He just figured it that out on his own is that Christmas was
28:17
just more than gift giving.
28:20
I think that really comes, not so much from me, as it was from my parents
28:25
who really believed that if you were successful in life, successful on any
28:29
level, you had an obligation to give back.
28:33
Certainly they did.
28:34
They were missionaries.
28:35
We would, this is a great story to share, because it really is
28:39
probably the reason why I’m a professional social worker today.
28:42
One Sunday out of every month my mom and my dad would drive to Salem with
28:46
the four kids in the car, our Nash.
28:49
Nobody had a Nash in the United States of America except the Steen family
28:52
[laughs] . I had never heard of this car before until my dad bought it.
28:55
We didn’t have a car most of my childhood.
28:57
When he finally bought a car he bought a Nash Ambassador.
29:00
They would drive to Salem one Sunday out of every month.
29:04
The reason they would do that, with us in the backseat, was because first they
29:08
didn’t believe in babysitters for us.
29:10
Perhaps they couldn’t afford it.
29:11
Don’t know.
29:12
But we would drive to Salem and what would my mom and dad would say is if
29:16
you stay in the car while we take care of our missionary work, we promise
29:22
you could have a chili hot dog on highway 99 on the way back to Portland.
29:26
What they would do, is my dad would go to the Oregon State Penitentiary
29:30
to meet with inmates that had come out of northeast Portland, that had
29:34
come out of our neighborhood, that had come from some family that he knew.
29:39
He would go to meet with them, to talk with them, encourage them to learn a
29:43
skill or a craft while they were in jail and that would make them much
29:48
more employable when they got out.
29:50
My mom would go to the Oregon State Mental Hospital with the same agenda.
29:56
She would want to meet with people who came out of our community, who
30:00
were in the mental hospital that may not have family that was able
30:05
to visit them and meet with them.
30:07
My mom probably was a natural born social worker, because what she said
30:12
is that when people, I’m using my language now, when people fall off
30:16
track, oftentimes it’s because they don’t have close family around them.
30:21
Her reason for going to the Oregon State Mental Hospital and the reason
30:24
for my dad going to the Oregon State Penitentiary is they were
30:27
trying to connect them with family.
30:30
I do know that my dad hired one or two that came out that had taken barbering
30:37
lessons while they were on the inside.
30:41
He hired them to be barbers for him when they came into Portland.
30:45
My mom didn’t hire anybody that I’m aware of as a beautician, too, that
30:51
came out of the mental hospital, but I do know Mildred had been
30:54
discharged, and Mildred lived with us.
30:56
Mildred was a young woman.
30:59
I remember my mom and dad sitting at the dining room table talking about
31:02
Mildred and the conditions in which they discharged her to their care.
31:08
It was that she would have to live with us.
31:10
So, I think probably she did for a couple months, maybe longer.
31:15
My memory is that probably it was just a couple of months, and then my mom bought
31:18
a train ticket and she says we’re going to send Mildred back home to her family
31:23
because Mildred will be just fine when she gets back home with her family.
31:27
My dad said do you think anybody will challenge that?
31:30
She says, I don’t know, but Mildred will go home to her family.
31:33
So, we went to the train station.
31:35
Mildred got on the train and Mildred went to, I think it was Tennessee,
31:39
but I can’t remember for sure.
31:41
I don’t know that my mom or dad ever heard from Mildred again.
31:44
They may have.
31:45
I just don’t know.
31:46
It was so clear to me that Mom knew the importance of family, that family
31:52
is what you need most often to support you as you’re growing up, as you
31:58
are making adult decisions, and when you have challenges or when you have
32:02
trouble, it’s family that’s needed.
32:04
We see that in our work all the time, that if we can reconnect individuals
32:08
who have fallen off track with family, with some personal relationship, with a
32:13
neighborhood that’s supportive, they do just fine moving on with their lives.
32:18
Mom fundamentally knew that.
32:22
Was she African American?
32:23
Yeah, my parents were African American.
32:24
No, I mean the—
32:24
Oh, Mildred, yes she was African American.
32:26
Yes, right.
32:28
Right.
32:31
You said your father was a barber.
32:35
When did he become a barber?
32:38
Right.
32:38
Mom opened her salon when she moved to Portland in the basement of our home.
32:43
They actually purchased their first home that we lived in on Northeast Hancock.
32:47
She opened up a salon.
32:48
My dad was working at a janitor at Federal Reserve Bank.
32:51
They bought some land two properties away from our house,
32:56
which was completely vacant.
32:57
They bought the land, and where the dream of Ben and Mary
33:02
Rose Steen became a reality.
33:03
They decided what they would do on that land is build a building that would house
33:08
Steen’s Beauty Salon and Barber Shop.
33:10
They built that building and it opened in 1952.
33:17
It was the first African owned business, African American owned business
33:24
that was built form the ground up.
33:26
It’s still in business today.
33:28
My nephew, my sister’s daughter, now is the manager of that business.
33:35
It is thriving and, as I said it’s the oldest African American owned
33:40
business in the state of Oregon.
33:42
And it’s still there.
33:45
It’s still there.
33:45
As a salon, a hair salon.
33:45
A beauty salon and barber shop.
33:45
A beauty salon and barber shop.
33:47
Right.
33:50
Do you have any idea, I mean it takes a lot of money to be able to do that.
33:58
Do you have any idea how they were able to accumulate the precepts
34:04
and get loans or what have you?
34:06
One of the things that was true with the high school that my parents went
34:09
to in Birmingham, Alabama, is that they did teach self-sufficiency.
34:13
They did teach all of those financial and accounting skills that you need if
34:17
you’re going to have your own business.
34:18
So, my dad knew that.
34:20
My dad and mom they also saved money.
34:23
They understood the value of saving money and that would allow you opportunity
34:27
to do things that you might not do if you did not have cash accumulated.
34:30
But you’re right.
34:32
It requires more than a savings account to open up a business.
34:36
My dad who preached from the time I can remember have excellent credit, save some
34:42
of the money that you get every week.
34:44
We had to save our “allowance” [air quote gesture] . We had to go to the bank.
34:46
We had a passbook account, all four of us, each of us.
34:51
When he drew the blueprint for the building, what did he do?
34:56
He did like most people who aspired to own their own business, he went to the bank.
35:00
He went to the bank that he had banked at from the time that he was in
35:05
Portland, Oregon, and applied for a loan.
35:08
That’s when he found out that it was illegal to loan money to Blacks, so my
35:14
dad could not get a loan from the bank.
35:17
My dad had become aware of a loan company on Union Avenue, and he
35:22
had seen an ad in a newspaper.
35:25
My dad worked part time as a barber at another barber shop.
35:28
He decided that he would approach them and see whether or not they
35:32
would consider giving him a loan.
35:34
He applied for a loan.
35:36
The loan officer had this long conversation with him.
35:39
Why do you want to do that?
35:41
You’re going to put your family at risk?
35:43
Da, da, da, da, da.
35:45
But they loaned him the money.
35:47
One of the reasons that the loan officer loaned him the money is that, according
35:52
to my dad, he said to my dad, I can tell what’s motivating you is that you
35:56
want a better future for your children.
36:01
In our culture, the Jewish culture, the children are the highest value.
36:06
He said, everything about your history tells me you’re going to pay this loan
36:10
back, so I’m loaning you the money.
36:12
You have a dream.
36:13
Your dream is for your kids, and I want you to be able to do that.
36:17
My dad paid off that loan in less time than required.
36:20
When he paid it off, the officer said the same thing when he made the loan.
36:24
He said, I knew you were going to be successful, because you were
36:27
doing it because of your children.
36:29
In the Jewish culture, you are successful because you care about your children.
36:33
There was this close relationship that my parents always had about Jewish people
36:39
helping out Black people, that Jewish people understood the pain and suffering
36:47
that comes from being treated differently for accidental characteristics, for
36:52
something that you don’t control.
36:55
We always had these positive messages about the Jewish culture and the
37:01
alignment of Jewish values with African American values and that is how my
37:06
dad was able to build that building.
37:08
He had the confidence and the financial resources that came from that loan
37:13
company on Union Avenue that was Jewish owned and it was a Jewish loan
37:16
officer who understood what my mom and my dad were trying to accomplish.
37:23
So, then you went to, so he had been a janitor, so he went to
37:28
a special barber school?
37:29
Yes.
37:30
How did that work out?
37:30
Well, he went to barber school here in Oregon, and you have to be licensed
37:34
as a barber or a beautician to be able to even practice as a barber
37:41
or a beautician and you need to have that license to open up a business.
37:45
He went to school by day, a janitor by night, got his license, was able to get
37:52
the loan, built the building, and then he and my mom had that business forevermore.
37:58
With the barber school, is there a different school for
38:01
African Americans than for White?
38:03
[Shakes head]
38:03
. Or do you learn to do all kinds of hair?
38:07
That’s really a good question.
38:08
No, there is not a separate school for African American hair and there’s not
38:13
a special teaching for African American hair, so my dad had to practice on and
38:20
know how to cut White hair, even though he stated the customers were all Black.
38:26
My mom, of course, she had her teaching in Birmingham, so she
38:30
knew how to teach Black hair.
38:32
I don’t know that she had to take a special exam here in Portland.
38:36
She had her license from Birmingham, Alabama, and I have her copies of the
38:41
license that she got here in Oregon.
38:43
The first one she got in Oregon was in 1947 and I just, I’m
38:47
going through old photos and old records, and I have a copy of that.
38:52
I don’t think she had to do anything other than present her license that
38:55
came out of Birmingham, Alabama.
38:56
It probably was a little more lax than it would be today.
39:00
But my dad, he had to not only take a course of study but he
39:03
also had to pass the exam here in Oregon to become a licensed barber.
39:11
To finish that story, you could not have a Black customer as the
39:17
customer that you use for your exam.
39:19
You had to have a White customer.
39:21
He had to perfect knowing how to cut hair of White people, like I said,
39:27
even though he was cutting the hair of Black people, which is very different.
39:31
It’s not the same.
39:33
Was it hard for him to learn to do the Black hair.
39:37
No.
39:37
No.
39:38
No, you know he worked in a Black barber shop and I’m sure the deal was we will
39:43
teach each other how to make sure we’re doing hair well and know exactly what we
39:47
need to do, but we also know that the only way we can get here with a license is for
39:50
all of us to know how to cut White hair.
39:52
I’m sure there was that
39:57
comradery that happens when you’re working close proximity to people.
40:02
They helped out each other.
40:04
They made it work.
40:06
Then you came back from Germany with your husband, and what did you do?
40:13
For the first few months, I was a stay-at-home mom.
40:16
I delivered my child 3 months after I got back from Europe.
40:21
I was a stay-at-home mom.
40:23
Then when I decided to go back to work, I decided I would begin to
40:27
use the knowledge I had gained as a student at the University of Portland.
40:31
My major was sociology and my minor was psychology—I had a double
40:35
minor in psychology and philosophy.
40:38
The first job that I applied for was as a caseworker with public welfare.
40:44
I got the job.
40:46
That was an interesting experience for me, because I wasn’t really sure what I
40:50
was going to be doing when I was hired as a caseworker, but once I realized what
40:55
I was required to do, the job duties and responsibilities, I was not okay with it.
41:03
The primary responsibility was determining eligibility for public
41:08
assistance and then making sure you managed and monitor those grants
41:13
that were awarded to those families.
41:15
It seemed to me that that was simply not going to help one mom,
41:21
one family go on with her life.
41:24
It was not going to help her ever become trained and employed.
41:28
It was not going to help her be able to leave that lifestyle behind and go
41:34
on with a life that would provide her with considerably more independence.
41:39
I did that for about a year, and then I applied for another job as director of
41:45
special services for the girl scouts, as they were rethinking how they were
41:50
going to do scouting in the inner city.
41:52
I was the director that looked at how to develop new badges, requirements
41:58
for badges, how to develop just a whole new kind of scouting that
42:01
would be much more interesting to girls that came from the inner city.
42:06
Again, I wasn’t real satisfied with that particular job, and I applied
42:11
to go to the school of social work at Portland State University.
42:15
I was admitted.
42:16
Once there, I knew clearly what I wanted to do with my interest
42:21
in sociology and social work.
42:23
That was policy.
42:25
I really felt like if you put your time, energy, and efforts into policy
42:30
development, advocacy for policy, that you would have much more of an impact on
42:35
the lives of people we were serving than if you were providing direct services.
42:39
Now, I know direct services are needed.
42:42
We have case managers in my organization, Volunteers of America, that deliver direct
42:48
services and they’re excellent at it.
42:51
I think they’re also individuals that are committed to social work that
42:55
understand that policy dictates the kind of success you can achieve with
43:01
many individuals and with my families.
43:03
My concentration as a graduate student of social work was in management.
43:09
They call it public administration.
43:16
I immediately went into a management position after getting my master’s degree.
43:23
I taught in the graduate school of social work for several years
43:26
and then started my ascent up the management ladder in social work.
43:35
Where did you teach?
43:36
At the graduate school of social work at Portland State University.
43:41
After I left that position, I was a branch manager for a public welfare
43:45
office where, again, I began to hone not only my skills but my interest in
43:51
knowing the impact that policy would have on the families that we were serving.
43:55
I wasn’t in that position a very long time when I applied for and
43:59
was hired as the deputy director of field operations for public welfare,
44:05
is what we called it at the time.
44:06
I was in that position for about 2 years when I was recruited by
44:12
Governor Victor Atiyeh to apply for the director of affirmative
44:15
action for the state of Oregon.
44:17
I applied for that position and was hired and really, that sort
44:22
of changed the trajectory for my career in a very significant way.
44:28
Before you continue, so in that process it sounds like it
44:33
was easy for you to get hired.
44:37
Were there obstacles or no obstacles?
44:43
What made it possible for you to be able to go up that ladder so quickly?
44:49
It’s a good question.
44:51
I take what I do, no matter what it is, very seriously.
44:55
I guess the best way I can answer that is that I was sure
45:00
that I would be competitive.
45:03
I have as a personal professional value excellence and try to live
45:08
that and try to adhere to it.
45:10
In the jobs, I’ve tried to demonstrate that and I think as
45:14
a consequence of it I may have
45:19
brought attention to my performance in what I was doing.
45:24
In most of the positions that I have ever been hired into, I’ve been recruited.
45:29
Someone recruited me to look into the position.
45:31
Most of the time I have said no and then they come back.
45:37
Why?
45:37
I think it’s because
45:42
I like to believe I’m in charge of making decisions about what’s best
45:46
for me and what should be next for me.
45:49
Maybe life is that way.
45:51
Maybe we’re not as in charge as we think, but when I took the position as assistant
45:58
professor at the graduate school of social work, the dean himself reached out and
46:03
said I want you to take this position.
46:05
I want you to look at this position.
46:08
At the time we were having that conversation, I didn’t think I was
46:11
ready, or quite frankly qualified, to be an assistant professor
46:15
in the school of social work.
46:17
We got into this dialogue of me saying no and him saying yes, and finally the
46:22
way we stopped it was I said, okay, what I’ll do, if you fill that position the
46:29
same way as you do any other position in the graduate school of social work, i.e.,
46:33
you do a national search, I’ll apply.
46:36
Then let the chips fall where they may.
46:38
He did just that.
46:39
I applied.
46:41
Three months later I was one of two finalists.
46:44
So, I think the reason why he may have been looking at me is that he
46:50
got some input, some information, some encouragement from others that maybe
46:56
he should look at me as joining the faculty at the school of social work.
47:02
I’ve not have that conversation with him.
47:04
He just said there was a lot of support for my application from
47:08
not only the faculty but students.
47:11
Again, when I was asked to apply for a position in the management track of public
47:18
welfare going up that trajectory, again,
47:24
I got recruited by a hiring manager who said we’d like for you to consider coming
47:30
into applied practice and not just be teaching at the school of social work.
47:35
So, I applied.
47:36
I applied for every position I’ve ever been hired into.
47:41
I don’t know how to answer your question.
47:44
Were there obstacles?
47:45
If there were, there weren’t obstacles that caused me to not want to pursue it.
47:51
I just tried to do the best, not only in the process of applying but
47:55
also in performing those duties.
47:58
I try to be the very best that I possibly can, and really challenge any
48:03
of my director supervisors if I’m not performing as you believe I should.
48:09
Let’s have that conversation, because I don’t want to do a poor job.
48:13
I’m not uncomfortable moving on.
48:16
I really do work very hard at trying to be the best that I
48:19
possibly can doing what I do.
48:25
I believe that you were now
48:31
teaching social work in the graduate school.
48:37
Right.
48:38
Social work.
48:38
So, keep going.
48:40
Okay, well.
48:41
I had applied for and been hired into two other positions in public, like I said,
48:46
public welfare, that’s what we called it at the time, when I got recruited to
48:50
apply for the director of affirmative action for Governor Victor Atiyeh.
48:54
I was hired into that position in 1979 and,
49:01
again, it was taking me out of my comfort level because I was, and am,
49:07
a social worker and I have never been dedicated to a civil rights program.
49:13
Affirmative action is a civil rights program and it was the top leadership
49:15
position in the state of Oregon.
49:18
When I had my interview with Governor Atiyeh, who was republican,
49:23
at the time had the reputation of being the most conservative
49:26
republican in the state of Oregon.
49:28
I have always been center of left in terms of my politics and how I view the world
49:33
and how I view the necessary decision making that goes along with that, but
49:38
when he interviewed me, at the end of the interview, I asked him this one question.
49:42
I said, what do you want to accomplish with this position called
49:45
director of affirmative action?
49:47
What do you see your role as governor?
49:52
He looked at me directly.
49:53
He said, I want to hire people who look just like you, finger pointed at me.
50:01
I want to hire people just like you in the top levels of state government.
50:06
I don’t know how to do that, so I need to have a partner
50:09
to help me move that agenda.
50:11
I thought that was pretty impressive, not only that he could articulate
50:15
it as clearly as he did, but that he had the passion to do that.
50:20
I worked for Governor Atiyeh for 7 and a half years.
50:24
I am pleased and honored to say that we had some of the best outcomes in terms
50:30
of hiring people at the top levels of state government who look just like me.
50:34
That included women.
50:35
It included Native American.
50:37
I’m going to give you some statistics.
50:39
We had a Native American who was head of the department of
50:42
corrections while Governor Atiyeh was in his leadership role.
50:46
We had an African American that was head of vocational rehabilitation.
50:49
We had an African American who was hired away from a fully tenured
50:53
position at Harvard law school, full professor, to be the dean of the school
51:00
of law at the University of Oregon.
51:02
We had African American head of the Oregon State parole board.
51:08
We had the first woman,
51:12
White woman, who was head of a major department in state government,
51:15
the department of general services.
51:17
There was just position after position after position over that
51:21
7 and a half year that accomplished exactly what that vision was.
51:26
Another demonstration, if you’ve got clear vision of what you want to accomplish,
51:30
secondly, you pull the necessary resources, including human resources, to
51:35
help you achieve that vision and you stay committed emotionally and practically
51:40
speaking you can get the job done.
51:43
One of the things that motivated Governor Atiyeh very early on as governor was there
51:48
was a cross burning in Milwaukee, Oregon.
51:50
A Black family who had moved there and there was a cross burning,
51:57
just sort of a nasty thing to happen to a young couple with young children.
52:03
Governor Atiyeh was so disturbed by that, he did two things, he said this
52:06
will not represent my administration.
52:09
This will not happen without my voice condemning it while
52:14
I’m governor of this state.
52:15
Secondly, I am going to introduce legislation that makes cross burning or
52:20
activities like that a class C felony.
52:24
We don’t today see too many elected officials go out front
52:29
and make a statement that this is unacceptable behavior and I’m
52:33
going to do something about it.
52:35
That was the environment in which I was able to do the job of
52:38
director of affirmative action.
52:40
A governor who was passionate.
52:42
A governor who was courageous and a governor who mobilized the state
52:46
to move in a certain direction.
52:49
That’s what we need all of the time until we get past this unfortunate
52:53
ugly behavior called whatever the ism is, whether it’s racism or
53:02
discrimination against the disabled, or whatever, sexism.
53:07
We need that voice, that voice that says this is unacceptable and we’re
53:12
going to do something about it.
53:18
Then,
53:21
as we’re now doing your job history, so then after that
53:31
7 years what did you do?
53:31
Obviously, governors in Oregon are term limited, so part of the reason that I was
53:35
there for 7 and a half years is Governor Atiyeh could not run for reelection again.
53:40
What year was that?
53:42
Let’s see, that would have been ’83,
53:47
1983.
53:47
I had some choices to make, like what am I going to do next?
53:52
I wasn’t real sure.
53:53
I had not really thought it through.
53:56
I thought about trying to move into the private sector again in affirmative
54:02
action or in human resources.
54:05
But a mentor of mine in state government said you’ve got two
54:10
strikes against you right now.
54:11
One is that affirmative action is seen as a “soft area of responsibility” [air quote
54:16
gesture] , and it may not translate well from government to the private sector.
54:22
Secondly, you also have a social work degree, you have a master’s in social
54:25
work which is seen as a “soft degree” [air quote gesture] for a management
54:29
position, upper management position in state government. He said, you’re going
54:33
to need another kind of experience to help propel you to where you want to be.
54:39
He actually suggested I apply for a job which was administrator of
54:45
the state’s purchasing division.
54:47
He said, why don’t you apply for that and see if that’s something that the
54:53
director will want to hire you into and, secondly, a job you might find
55:00
some satisfaction in doing for this reason—it provides you with an opportunity
55:05
to be responsible for something that affected all of state government.
55:09
Well, I’m not this person who ever thought about being a purchasing administrator.
55:15
But I applied and I got hired.
55:18
It was really genius on the part of my mentor to suggest that I do that,
55:23
because the person that hired me was the woman who was director of the
55:27
largest department, second largest department in state government,
55:30
department of general services.
55:31
She hired me and I was in that position for almost 3 years and it gave me an
55:37
opportunity to really get a sense of the business side of state government.
55:43
It also gave me an opportunity to interact with most of the department directors.
55:47
It gave me an opportunity to get to know the chancellor in the
55:50
department of higher education.
55:52
It was a rich rounding experience.
55:55
From that position, the director of the department of children services
55:59
reached out to me and said I’d like you to consider a management position
56:03
in children services division.
56:05
He says, I’ve been watching you when you were in the governor’s office.
56:07
Certainly, we had to interact with you when you were making, helping us make
56:11
major purchases for their division.
56:13
Would you give it some consideration?
56:15
I applied, was hired to what was equivalent to a middle management position
56:20
in the department of children services.
56:22
I was in that position for 6 months when I was promoted to the deputy administrator
56:28
for Multnomah County, one of the larger responsibilities within children services.
56:33
I was in that position for 2 years when I was recruited to
56:38
apply for the directorship of the department of children services.
56:44
I did.
56:45
I was hired.
56:46
On one level, there was probably was a naiveté in terms
56:48
of what I was getting into.
56:49
That’s a tough job.
56:51
Secondly, it really did give me an opportunity to think through how do
56:56
you bring resources together to address an organization that’s troubled,
57:03
that’s bordering on dysfunction, that has some highly courageous,
57:10
wonderful people working for it.
57:12
What do you need to do in a leadership role to do that kind of
57:15
changes that are required to move that agency in the right direction?
57:20
It was a wonderful experience.
57:24
I was there for, how many years was it?
57:27
I guess 6 and a half years, almost 7 years.
57:30
What was wrong and what did you want to change it to?
57:34
Right.
57:35
Child welfare, statutorily, is responsible for children who are abused and neglected.
57:42
It’s the kind of responsibility where on any one day you’re going to
57:45
have people who support you and you can have people who are absolutely
57:49
against the decision making that is required when you are trying to
57:53
make sure that children are safe.
57:55
There are lots of challenges, and there have been a lot of challenges.
57:59
Prior to my being hired into that leadership role, it was under-resourced.
58:05
There were a lack of caseworkers that were needed to be able to do that job well.
58:11
There was a lack of commitment to resourcing training.
58:16
There were just a lot of challenges.
58:20
My way of approaching that was to organize a statewide committee along with
58:27
representatives from the juvenile rights project which had sent an intent to sue
58:31
letter to the department of justice.
58:33
We decided let’s have a statewide committee that develops a strategic
58:38
plan on how to address each one of those challenges and barriers
58:43
that existed within the agency.
58:46
We got statewide input.
58:47
It was a successful plan development.
58:50
The legislature not only supported the plan, but the
58:54
legislature also funded the plan.
58:57
It was more than I could ever have hoped for, but it was more than hope.
59:01
It was concerted effort by many, many capable professionals who
59:08
said let’s invest in this division, in this work in such a way that
59:13
we can begin to turn it around.
59:15
We also had complete support of the governor of the state to do this.
59:21
[Break in recording]
59:22
. So, we were, where were we?
59:27
I think we had just kind of talked about my leadership at department of
59:33
general services for the state of Oregon.
59:35
Okay.
59:37
Continue from there as you go up with your professional life.
59:42
Sure.
59:43
I was in that position of leadership with child welfare for 6 and a half
59:49
years when the legislature approved the budget that we had recommended,
59:54
which resulted in a 25% increase in the operating budget for our organization
59:59
and also the strategic plan that we had worked on for a couple of years.
1:00:03
I felt it was then time for me to move on and allow the governor to hire a
1:00:09
manager to come in and implement the changes that we had approved and I
1:00:14
was going to spend some time taking a year off work to write my memoir.
1:00:21
I have this dream to share our life story, my story, my parents’ story, our
1:00:26
family’s story, with the broader public.
1:00:28
However, that dream only lasted for about 2 months when a search firm reached out
1:00:34
and asked me to apply for the presidency position for Volunteers of America.
1:00:40
You were how old at that time?
1:00:41
Oh, geeze.
1:00:42
Well,
1:00:45
I’ll answer that this way, I’ve been there 20 years.
1:00:48
Okay?
1:00:49
So, that would make me what 56 at the time?
1:00:52
Yeah.
1:00:55
I didn’t want to take on that responsibility, but decided after
1:01:00
several conversations with the firm and also the board and the subcommittee
1:01:04
of the board that I would apply.
1:01:07
As a consequence of applying, I was hired into the position with the plan
1:01:12
to stay maybe 5 years to get them at a place where they could move on and
1:01:17
continue to grow the organization.
1:01:19
But I became so addicted to the work that we were doing and the populations that we
1:01:24
were serving and the opportunity again for advocacy to change that I am still there.
1:01:30
I will have been there 20 years in July in that leadership role.
1:01:36
I have thoroughly,
1:01:40
really been satisfied with being a part of that organization.
1:01:45
Can you tell us more about that organization, the Volunteers of America?
1:01:49
That’s correct.
1:01:50
The Volunteers of America Oregon.
1:01:52
I am the leader of the Oregon affiliate.
1:01:55
We’re a broad based human service, health and human service organization,
1:01:59
so we provide social services in early childhood to high-risk families that
1:02:05
are at risk of abuse and neglect.
1:02:07
We also have a domestic violence solutions program for women who have made the
1:02:12
decision to move out of a home where there has been violence and to move on with
1:02:17
their lives and provide a safe environment for themselves and their children.
1:02:22
However, the lion’s share of our responsibility is in addiction treatment.
1:02:27
We have a residential treatment program for men and one for
1:02:31
women, but we also do outpatient addiction mental health treatment.
1:02:36
The population that we serve is some of the highest risk
1:02:39
individuals in our community.
1:02:40
They’ve all touched the criminal justice system.
1:02:43
Our efforts are to support them as they reenter into our community,
1:02:48
support them in such a way that they get their lives back on track.
1:02:51
They’re able to reconnect, reunite with their families.
1:02:54
We’re able to help them get employment and housing and to move on making
1:02:58
a contribution in our community.
1:03:01
Then on the backend of the age continuum, we also provide adult
1:03:06
day services to the frail elderly.
1:03:08
We do that in part in a partnership with Providence health and services.
1:03:13
We serve the full spectrum of children and families through Volunteers of America.
1:03:19
Just a real quick story about why we call ourselves Volunteers of
1:03:22
America, is that we’re 123 years old.
1:03:26
Not only in Portland, but nationwide, and when we were founded we were founded by
1:03:31
the son of a founder of Salvation Army.
1:03:35
That son, along with his brother, came to this continent
1:03:38
to replicate Salvation Army.
1:03:41
Our founder made the decision that it was in their best interest, him and his wife’s
1:03:46
interest, to start a new organization here in the United States of America.
1:03:52
Making that decision meant that he lost the revenue that was coming out of London.
1:03:56
They had to start the organization with a cadre of volunteers.
1:04:00
So, they named it Volunteers of America, incorporated in the
1:04:03
state of New York, 123 years ago.
1:04:05
We had a Salvation Army affiliate here in Oregon and that affiliate made the
1:04:10
decision to follow Volunteers of America.
1:04:12
That’s the reason why we are the age that we are and doing what we’re doing today.
1:04:17
Today, I have about 320 professionals that provide services, paid
1:04:23
professionals that provide services through Volunteers of America.
1:04:26
So,
1:04:28
we march on.
1:04:32
There was something else you asked me to speak to.
1:04:39
I have been doing professional social work at the leadership level now for
1:04:47
20 years, and one of the things I love about my role is that we have been in
1:04:52
the vanguard of advocating for changes in our criminal justice system, a change
1:04:58
that is absolutely essential if we’re going to be responding to the needs of
1:05:03
individuals in the most effective way, also redirecting financial resources away
1:05:10
from the system where we’re not getting the return on investment, and actually
1:05:14
just become a much more humane community.
1:05:17
Volunteers of America has been focused on trying to develop and provide reentry
1:05:23
services to the population that gets released from prison or incarceration.
1:05:30
We also know
1:05:34
that our choices in the reentry program are going to help people be successful
1:05:40
with their release from prison, with their release from incarceration.
1:05:44
The public policy advocacy is much more pronounced and much more
1:05:49
possible from this position than it was when I was in state government.
1:05:53
You have a lot more flexibility in a non-profit.
1:05:55
You have a lot more personal advocacy that comes from your board of directors and you
1:06:00
can also organize community support in a much more effective way from a nonprofit.
1:06:05
I’ve really enjoyed every minute of that.
1:06:07
Can you tell a bit more about that, what you’ve actually done with some
1:06:11
specific examples, whether it’s community organization or advocacy with
1:06:16
the government?
1:06:18
Sure, about 18 years ago we actually designed support service
1:06:24
for individuals that were being released after Measure XI crimes.
1:06:28
Measure XI in Oregon is one strike you’re out.
1:06:32
There was no plan once the voters voted that into law.
1:06:36
Once you serve your time, then what?
1:06:40
So, we reached out to several provider communities.
1:06:44
We worked with Multnomah County government and said let’s develop a response to that.
1:06:50
Let’s develop a program that actually caters to those individuals that are
1:06:54
being released after Measure XI crime.
1:06:59
Explain again what Measure XI crime is?
1:07:02
Measure XI,
1:07:05
to simplify it, is one strike you’re out.
1:07:07
There’s certain felonies that if
1:07:11
they are committed and you are convicted you’re immediately incarcerated.
1:07:18
Prior to Measure XI judges were able to take background and
1:07:23
history into consideration.
1:07:25
There are some extenuating circumstances sometimes that makes long sentence not
1:07:32
in the best interest of an individual.
1:07:34
With Measure XI, the judge doesn’t have that flexibility.
1:07:37
In other words, what Measure XI did when the voters voted that into law was
1:07:41
take discretion away from the judges.
1:07:43
So, you commit a certain crime and you’re convicted of that crime
1:07:45
you’re going to serve 5 years.
1:07:47
There is no option there.
1:07:50
I believe our criminal justice system needs to be more humane than that.
1:07:54
There are always other circumstances that you need to take into consideration when
1:07:58
you’re looking at one’s behavior and one’s criminal background, criminal offense.
1:08:06
Volunteers
1:08:08
of America Oregon made a decision that we would develop a program that would
1:08:13
respond to those individuals that had been convicted of a Measure XI crime
1:08:18
by allowing them into a supportive service wraparound program, which we
1:08:22
call Community Partners Reinvestment.
1:08:26
We relied on community partners.
1:08:28
We said it was a reinvestment in these individuals and their lives.
1:08:32
It was our way of helping them get reconnected with their family,
1:08:36
reconnected with their children, and really make every effort to go on
1:08:41
with their lives in a successful way.
1:08:43
We started that program.
1:08:45
It was supported by foundations outside of the state of Oregon.
1:08:48
It was supported by foundations in the state of Oregon and also by the department
1:08:53
of corrections and the department
1:08:58
of community justice from Multnomah County.
1:09:00
We need to do more in criminal justice reform.
1:09:03
This ought to be one of the campaigns that everybody embraces.
1:09:07
If we do this smart, we not only are responding better to the lives that are
1:09:13
affected by these kinds of decisions but we also are in a position to
1:09:17
redirect dollars to where we really need it, and that’s in public education.
1:09:22
Every dollar that goes into corrections we have to ask ourselves is that
1:09:25
the best way to spend that dollar or should we be looking at diversion.
1:09:28
Should we be looking at
1:09:32
supportive programs once people are released, individuals
1:09:35
are released from prison?
1:09:39
Are those dollars better spent there or are they better spent in public education.
1:09:44
It’s a conversation that I think our public really needs to have,
1:09:46
and we have not had in the state of Oregon in a very effective way.
1:09:52
That’s one of the ways that Volunteers of America has been responsive and
1:09:55
trying to be on the front end of reform and of change, social change.
1:10:02
We really need to have a conversation about what’s happening in the world
1:10:06
of addiction, with the overuse, misuse of drugs in our society.
1:10:12
We should have had a conversation about the decriminalization of marijuana.
1:10:17
I can argue both sides of that.
1:10:18
I need to be real honest about that.
1:10:20
On one side, I think people have been incarcerated for drug offenses that
1:10:25
should not have been incarcerated.
1:10:27
By the same token, I talk to individuals who are in a drug treatment
1:10:30
program and some of them will say I think marijuana is a gateway drug.
1:10:34
You have both sides of that issue.
1:10:37
That is why a public conversation needs to continue to be ongoing about what’s
1:10:43
the best way to respond to an issue that everybody cares about, because it’s
1:10:48
going to affect us one way or the other.
1:10:50
There’s no right or wrong answer, but let’s be informed about the
1:10:54
decisions that we make and understand what the consequences might be
1:10:57
when we make those decisions.
1:11:04
You’re still doing this work and you’re 76 years old, are you ever going to retire?
1:11:12
I will change what I’m doing.
1:11:14
I don’t even like the term retirement.
1:11:18
I am a person who really gets a lot of joy out of being engaged and by being involved
1:11:28
in the lives of my family, the lives of my children, the lives of my grandchildren,
1:11:32
but also the larger community.
1:11:34
I really just get joy out of doing that, so I will change what I’m doing.
1:11:41
I won’t always be the leader of Volunteers of America Oregon.
1:11:45
But retirement is not in my lexicon.
1:11:48
I will do something else.
1:11:50
Right now I’m pretty clear something else will be really focusing on completing my
1:11:56
memoir and getting that out and published and in the hands of people who might be
1:12:02
able to first, just appreciate the story, but secondly maybe learn something from
1:12:08
some of the experiences that I have had.
1:12:10
Now let’s go back a little bit more to your personal life.
1:12:14
Yes.
1:12:17
We were in when you came back to Portland from Germany with
1:12:25
your husband you had a baby.
1:12:29
Tell us a little bit about what was going on in your family, how you
1:12:34
had a baby and trying to work, etc.
1:12:40
Probably just picking up after becoming a mom and having the responsibility
1:12:48
of trying to determine how I’m going to educate my own daughter.
1:12:52
I had some challenges about what was happening in the
1:12:55
educational system at the time.
1:12:58
I was able to, along with my husband, I was able to have my
1:13:01
daughter go to a Montessori school.
1:13:05
My daughter was able to read at age 3 and age 4, probably more like 3.
1:13:11
She read everything.
1:13:14
I wanted to make sure when she went into the first grade that her
1:13:20
growth and development educationally would continue and that would be an
1:13:24
experience that was enhanced by the choice of the schools she attended.
1:13:29
I had an interesting experience, because when she went to the first grade,
1:13:32
and this was public school and public school here in Portland, the first
1:13:37
grade teacher had a side conversation with me on parent teacher night.
1:13:42
What she said to me, this was like week 2 maybe, she said your daughter
1:13:47
knows all I’m supposed to teach her already, which I thought was astounding.
1:13:52
I was surprised, maybe disappointed, but also I appreciated that
1:13:58
she had the confidence and the courage to say that to me.
1:14:02
What she was saying is that maybe you ought to consider some other
1:14:06
school options for your daughter.
1:14:08
She didn’t say that, but that was the suggestion, so I did.
1:14:13
My daughter was able to go to a private school after that.
1:14:17
I decided I would take heed.
1:14:19
I would pay attention to what the teacher was sharing with me.
1:14:22
That very next week did some research and then made a decision that she
1:14:27
would move from the school she was in and go to a private school.
1:14:29
My daughter went to 12 years of private education here in Portland.
1:14:36
Shortly after she started to school was when I went through a divorce and then
1:14:42
several years after that I remarried and then had another child, my son.
1:14:48
Because of my daughter being in a private school, my son
1:14:50
also went to a private school.
1:14:52
My second husband was a lawyer here in Portland, one of the early African
1:14:58
American lawyers here in the state of Oregon at a successful practice.
1:15:04
We had a successful family for several years.
1:15:07
We lived here with my kids going on and doing well in their education and
1:15:13
I’m doing well in my career, and to a certain point did well in our marriage.
1:15:19
I’m not going to go into detail about what didn’t go right, but it didn’t.
1:15:24
So, after a period of time I was divorced and a single mom.
1:15:30
Because of the position that I was in, the job that I had specifically, I was
1:15:35
probably in a much better opportunity to manage that than some women are who
1:15:40
are questioning or have to question what kind of income they have.
1:15:43
What job was it at that time when you got divorced then the second time, which
1:15:50
of your jobs was it, do you remember?
1:15:52
Yeah, I was head of department of children services...
1:15:55
Okay.
1:15:55
...state agency, right.
1:16:02
They were able to, my kids, my son and my daughter, they were able to
1:16:08
go on through, what I call, lower education and have a successful
1:16:14
experience and then go off to college.
1:16:16
My daughter went east to college, and my son, he went to southeast to college.
1:16:22
They both lived on the east coast for several years before coming back
1:16:26
to Portland, and I have made this commitment to them that I will not
1:16:29
tell their story, so much about their lives will have to be for them to tell.
1:16:37
I think probably the reason why I can feel the way that I feel about both
1:16:43
marriages and about my private life is that unlike many women, I was in much more
1:16:51
control over the decisions that I make about where I was working, what I did.
1:16:56
I did not have to move out of my home after the divorce.
1:16:59
I was able to stay here.
1:17:04
I can’t say that mine was a typical single woman experience.
1:17:13
Now tell us about these different places that you did live in
1:17:17
Portland and the stories of how you found the places and so on.
1:17:21
Right.
1:17:22
I grew up in northeast Portland.
1:17:24
Then when I was 14 my parents moved to Mount
1:17:29
Tabor.
1:17:29
Up until the time I left home after college, I lived in southeast Portland.
1:17:34
My parents made a calculated decision that they wanted to live there rather
1:17:40
than in the home that we were raised in primarily because it was a better
1:17:44
house, and even though there were some challenges at the time, when they made
1:17:50
the decision to move to Mount Tabor, African American families lived in a very
1:17:56
segregated part of northeast Portland.
1:17:58
It was not typical for Black families to move out of that area,
1:18:02
which was basically the Willamette River probably as far east as
1:18:11
maybe 14th, maybe 21st from Broadway to the river, the Columbia River.
1:18:15
That basically was where most Black people lived in Portland, Oregon.
1:18:19
To move outside of that, presented its challenges.
1:18:21
It presented probably some challenges to my parents that they never talked about.
1:18:27
We found out, we, my siblings and I, found out many years later there was strong
1:18:33
opposition from some of the families in Mount Tabor for my family moving there.
1:18:39
if my parents knew any of that, they didn’t share it with us.
1:18:44
I was “popular” [air quote gesture] , in quotes, in high school, so I
1:18:48
didn’t feel it in high school.
1:18:50
Now, my younger sister, who was in grade school, elementary school at
1:18:52
the time, she said one of her teachers did say to her, just a child, that you
1:18:58
know there was a strong opposition to your family moving into the community.
1:19:02
We talk about that now.
1:19:03
We say, how interesting that the teacher felt comfortable saying that to a
1:19:07
child, and then, secondly, we really would like to know what he experienced,
1:19:12
or what he heard, what he knew.
1:19:14
But relatively peaceful existence in Mount Tabor.
1:19:19
Then we go our separate ways.
1:19:22
I got to the University of Portland, Europe, then back here lived always in
1:19:27
northeast Portland and when John and I married, shortly after I married, we moved
1:19:31
here, which is called northeast Alameda.
1:19:35
At the time northeast Alameda was almost all White.
1:19:40
But, again, we had no problems moving into this community, in part because John
1:19:44
was a lawyer, knew a lot of the families.
1:19:46
There were a lot of lawyers that live here.
1:19:47
He knew them.
1:19:49
I think my career at that point was just visible enough so that if we were unknown,
1:19:55
we didn’t have some of the obstacles we might have had if we were unknown.
1:19:59
My sister lives on the east coast, and my older sister lived in inner northeast and
1:20:05
because she had such a great clientele at the beauty salon, I think she never
1:20:10
had problems living where she lived.
1:20:13
Sort of that neighborhood ostracism that comes because of race, I don’t think any
1:20:20
of us experienced that here in Portland.
1:20:26
Tell us sort of on another subject, tell us a little bit more
1:20:31
about what you do for enjoyment.
1:20:35
What is your social life like and kind of a little history of your social
1:20:40
life as a child and as an adult?
1:20:43
I
1:20:46
always had a couple of neighborhood friends as a child that we were
1:20:51
friends all the way through childhood.
1:20:54
We did what kids do.
1:20:56
Are you looking for something?
1:20:57
I’m sorry.
1:20:59
We do what kids do.
1:21:00
We would go to skating parties on Monday night with kids in the neighborhood.
1:21:04
There were house parties that we would go to as we got older.
1:21:10
Oaks Park, Jantzen Beach, things that kids do.
1:21:15
As I got older, I became a lot more inbred in the sense that—
1:21:23
I’m going to interrupt you one second.
1:21:24
You said you’d go to Jantzen Beach.
1:21:26
At what point was Jantzen Beach integrated?
1:21:29
Well, it wasn’t when I was a child.
1:21:31
You could go to the amusement park, but you could not go to the swimming pool.
1:21:35
So you went for the amusement park?
1:21:37
Right.
1:21:37
Exactly.
1:21:38
Right.
1:21:38
The swimming pool, no colored were allowed, and that was true
1:21:42
almost with every swimming pool.
1:21:44
Right, and so what we would do, we would save our money and we would go
1:21:49
to participate in the amusement rides and have picnics there with our family.
1:21:56
Oaks Park, we rarely went there, never Blue Lake, because
1:21:59
Blue Lake was restricted.
1:22:00
Tell us about Oaks Park.
1:22:02
Oaks Park was another amusement park, and it was probably not as
1:22:06
sophisticated as Jantzen Beach.
1:22:08
I always thought that Jantzen Beach was designed for kids and families with money.
1:22:15
I don’t know why I thought that, maybe because it always was very clean.
1:22:20
Oaks Park was more like the place for the people.
1:22:24
We went to both.
1:22:25
We went to many church picnics at Oaks Park for sure, and they
1:22:30
had a skating rink there, too.
1:22:32
Skating was something we all did as kids.
1:22:34
Roller skating?
1:22:35
Roller skating, yes.
1:22:36
Right.
1:22:37
Then the other skating rink, I can’t remember the name of it at the moment,
1:22:41
but that was a Monday night activity where all of the kids from the neighborhood
1:22:45
would go skating on Monday night.
1:22:47
We would get there maybe at 5:00 and skate until 8:00.
1:22:52
You’d talk about it for the next 3 or 4 days and then you’re there next Monday.
1:22:55
That was like the neighborhood thing to do when we were growing up.
1:22:59
As young adults, we would spend a lot of time with other young adults, and we
1:23:06
would spend time going out to dinner.
1:23:08
We’d go to the Cotton Club.
1:23:10
I don’t know if you’ve heard about the Cotton Club, but the Cotton Club
1:23:12
that was owned by Paul and Geneva Knauls on Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
1:23:16
That was the hippest place in the city of Portland to go.
1:23:18
They had live entertainment.
1:23:20
It was just a fun place to be.
1:23:23
Elaborate on that, what kind of music, who went there.
1:23:27
It was, to describe it so that people would understand it, it was Black music.
1:23:33
That was during the time of Motown, so it was Motown music.
1:23:37
It was
1:23:40
music that came out of Detroit, music that came out of Philadelphia.
1:23:45
It was just the hip place to be.
1:23:48
It wasn’t just exclusive to Blacks, because there were people
1:23:51
from all over town who wanted to go to a hip place, a cool place.
1:23:54
They would go to the Cotton Club.
1:23:56
That’s what we would do.
1:23:57
What was different then, than now, is the young couples, we would all go places.
1:24:02
Sometimes we would go to a movie early, then end up at the Cotton
1:24:05
Club, then we would go to a restaurant for breakfast before going home.
1:24:08
I say to young people, you guys poop out at 11:00, 12:00 at
1:24:12
nighttime, because you’re tired.
1:24:13
We were up until 3:00 or 4:00 and don’t tell me that we have such energy, because
1:24:17
all of us were young parents at the time.
1:24:20
We definitely were having a good time in our community and having a good
1:24:23
time that were a part of our community.
1:24:28
We are not as connected now.
1:24:33
I think tastes have changed, music has changed.
1:24:37
it may be too expensive to go to dinner and to nightclubs when we
1:24:42
used to when I was a young adult.
1:24:44
We went all the time.
1:24:47
It may just be cost prohibitive to do that today.
1:24:49
I still, my form of real personal enjoyment and entertainment is to
1:24:55
have a nice meal out in a restaurant.
1:24:57
I still do that today.
1:24:58
Every now and then I will go to a movie.
1:25:01
Movies are not as enjoyable to me today as they were 20 years ago, 30 years ago.
1:25:07
I dare say, because I probably will offend a lot of people, I dare say the
1:25:11
movies were better than they are now.
1:25:13
I’m not a superhero person.
1:25:15
I’m not a blood and gore person.
1:25:17
I like a story that’s well told.
1:25:20
I like a narrative that’s real clear.
1:25:23
I like suspense and I like glamor and I go to those kinds of movies, and those
1:25:30
are not necessarily easy to find today.
1:25:36
What about your friends,
1:25:39
what kind of friends, do you have a circle of friends or are you isolated?
1:25:45
No, other professional friends, definitely professional girlfriends.
1:25:50
Some of them are local and some of them are nationwide.
1:25:53
There are a group of us that will meet maybe once a year.
1:25:56
I have a timeshare in Florida.
1:25:58
We’ll meet there and catch up.
1:26:02
I still have four or five of my girlfriends from high school and we go
1:26:06
to dinner maybe once every 2 months, 3 months, regularly and kind of catch
1:26:12
up with each other, find out what’s happening with our other classmates.
1:26:18
Most of my friends are what I call professional friends that either live in
1:26:22
close proximity or have some relationship to me over the course of my lifetime.
1:26:28
I think you mentioned earlier that currently you’re closer African American
1:26:34
friends do not live in Portland.
1:26:38
From high school.
1:26:39
From high school
1:26:40
Right.
1:26:41
Then so when you’re going out now for dinner or socializing with people,
1:26:48
you have people over for dinner?
1:26:49
Go to people’s houses?
1:26:51
I used to do a lot more entertaining here at home than I do currently.
1:26:56
I used to thoroughly enjoy inviting 2 or 3 couples over for dinner.
1:27:01
I love to cook.
1:27:02
That’s my art form.
1:27:03
I enjoy it.
1:27:05
I enjoy sharing that art form with others.
1:27:08
I like everything about it.
1:27:09
I like shopping for the groceries.
1:27:11
I like planning for the meal.
1:27:13
I like decorating the table.
1:27:15
I like watching people eat and savor the food.
1:27:18
I like their response.
1:27:20
If the response is delayed, I think don’t do that again or change it
1:27:23
if you’re going to do that again.
1:27:24
I love that.
1:27:26
I would do more of it, if I had the time to do it.
1:27:30
I think right now, and this is a weakness on my part, I think I allow my
1:27:35
professional life to be all-consuming.
1:27:37
When I get home I just don’t have the energy and the time
1:27:41
to what I used to love to do
1:27:44
20 and 25 years ago.
1:27:46
However, it’s not wasted time, because I’ve done a lot more thinking about how I
1:27:51
want to frame and share this story and I actually go through some mental processes
1:27:58
thinking about how I want to do that.
1:28:00
It’s not like it’s wasted time when I, late afternoon, thinking
1:28:06
and listening and watching.
1:28:08
I love storytelling on television.
1:28:11
Is that a genre that I can glean from to tell my own story?
1:28:18
I like listening to how people present their narratives.
1:28:22
I like news.
1:28:24
I’m a policy news wonk.
1:28:28
I get a certain amount of energy from knowing what’s happening in our world
1:28:34
and then dictating what that means to me in terms of, again, my advocacy.
1:28:40
I think we have a lot of troubles right now and a lot of challenges,
1:28:43
and not necessarily what I can a responsible way of responding.
1:28:49
If I can contribute to it being a responsible response, I will do that.
1:28:55
I feel like my life is probably 28 hours of the 24 a day and
1:29:02
10 days of the 7 days a week.
1:29:04
I’m busy all the time, involved all the time, connected with people
1:29:08
all the time, talking all the time, challenging people to do more, even
1:29:12
though they feel like they have less.
1:29:14
Are you working full time now?
1:29:16
Yes, I work full time.
1:29:17
So, but its Thursday when we’re having this interview.
1:29:21
Yes.
1:29:22
Is this, are you kind of including this as part of?
1:29:26
I’m on vacation time.
1:29:27
I’m on what we call paid leave time.
1:29:29
So you took leave for us?
1:29:31
Yes.
1:29:32
Well, thank you.
1:29:32
[Laughs] Well, thank you for the invitation, yeah.
1:29:39
I saw on your paper with your education that you have an honorary doctorate.
1:29:45
Can you tell us about that?
1:29:47
Yes.
1:29:48
I’m very proud of that.
1:29:50
I am a graduate of the University of Portland and feel like it provided
1:29:55
me with a superb education, excellent education, and I believe it is an
1:29:59
extension of
1:30:02
what my parents tried to do with them making sure that we were
1:30:06
in a faith-based environment.
1:30:09
University of Portland is Catholic and it is definitely faith-based.
1:30:14
There are all the values that are important to who I am how
1:30:18
I live my life were definitely there on a variety of levels.
1:30:23
So, when it appeared like it was appropriate for them and for myself
1:30:28
I was invited to join the Board of Regents and I am currently a
1:30:31
member of the Board of Regents.
1:30:33
I also support that university in whatever way I possibly can.
1:30:38
I didn’t do this this year but in the past I’ve had the Black students that
1:30:43
are students at the University of Portland over for dinner for two reasons.
1:30:47
It isn’t a university that has a large population of Black students, so I want
1:30:52
to know that they are having a really high-quality experience, and if they
1:30:56
are not what could we do differently?
1:30:59
But also it’s a place that’s not on campus.
1:31:02
It’s a place that’s not in the dorm.
1:31:04
They can come here.
1:31:05
They can let their hair down.
1:31:06
We have dinner and we’re on this floor.
1:31:09
I’ve had as many as 24 people here from the University and then after we’ve had
1:31:14
dinner I let them go downstairs, play music, listen to music, have dessert.
1:31:20
I don’t go down there, just let them talk to each other.
1:31:23
They seem to enjoy it.
1:31:25
I definitely, I get a high level of excitement and enjoyment
1:31:30
out of being able to do that.
1:31:32
Well, in other words, I’ve been connected to the university in one
1:31:35
way or another for a very long time.
1:31:37
So, about, I think about 5 years ago at this point, maybe 7 years ago, I
1:31:43
was told that I was going to receive an honorary doctorate for the work in the
1:31:48
community, primarily the work that I’ve done with people in general and then
1:31:52
my ongoing support of the university.
1:31:55
I felt that, and feel like that was a very, very high honor.
1:31:59
You can’t make that happen.
1:32:01
Somebody has got to make that decision to do that and they have to look at their
1:32:06
own reasons and criteria for doing it, so I thought it was a very high honor.
1:32:10
Let’s talk a little bit about your relationship to the church.
1:32:14
So, you belong to the Catholic Church.
1:32:17
No.
1:32:17
I am not a Catholic.
1:32:18
No.
1:32:18
I’m not a Catholic.
1:32:19
Oh, you’re not.
1:32:19
Okay, that’s what—explain a little bit about that.
1:32:19
No.
1:32:22
I was raised a Baptist.
1:32:24
My relationship now is with a Baptist church that’s online out of Maryland.
1:32:28
I am not a member of a local church here.
1:32:31
Why aren’t you a member of a local church?
1:32:34
It’s not why I’m not.
1:32:35
It’s why I am a member of the church that I am.
1:32:38
A friend of mine who is in Vancouver, knows that I love to travel.
1:32:43
That’s my avocation.
1:32:44
She is a member of this church, and she says they have planned a trip to Brazil.
1:32:50
It’s a Black church.
1:32:51
They planned a trip to Brazil.
1:32:52
Would you like to go?
1:32:53
Well, I’ve always wanted to go to Brazil.
1:32:55
I thought, well, let me explore this and see what it’s about.
1:33:00
I did.
1:33:01
And I agreed,
1:33:05
not agreed, but I paid to be a part of that tour group.
1:33:09
I really was impressed with the pastor.
1:33:12
He’s a relatively young man.
1:33:14
He is all about social justice and social change.
1:33:18
It’s another form of Kay Toran.
1:33:22
I really like the fact that he’s planning these adventures to
1:33:27
predominantly Black countries.
1:33:28
I did not know that Bahia, the southern part of Brazil, is predominantly Black,
1:33:33
five million Black people in Bahia.
1:33:37
That’s more Blacks that any other part of our continent.
1:33:40
That was all new to me.
1:33:43
They’ve been able to maintain the African culture.
1:33:46
It was such a rich, exciting experience that when I got back
1:33:50
I thought I want more of that.
1:33:52
That’s the reason I’m connected to that church.
1:33:55
It has nothing to do with being against anything here.
1:33:57
It’s just that
1:34:01
it has a mission and agenda that really speaks to me.
1:34:05
Have you been to Africa?
1:34:07
No.
1:34:07
I have not.
1:34:08
That’s your next?
1:34:09
Ghana.
1:34:10
That’s my next trip.
1:34:11
It’s Ghana.
1:34:13
Next trip.
1:34:14
I
1:34:16
just want to go back a little bit to something that’s a
1:34:19
little more, that’s fun.
1:34:21
You say you really like cooking and doing that, so what kind of food do you cook and
1:34:30
what are your food interests and tastes?
1:34:33
Yeah.
1:34:33
Well, that’s really a good question because I’m very eclectic.
1:34:36
I have yet to find a cuisine that I don’t like.
1:34:41
I really focus on foods that are flavorful, that are spicy, that
1:34:51
introduce new kinds of food choices.
1:34:55
For example, I was able to go to Peru and I just fell in love with quinoa.
1:35:00
It’s tasty.
1:35:01
It’s
1:35:05
food that I have never had before.
1:35:07
It is as rich in protein as meat.
1:35:10
I started cooking quinoa.
1:35:11
I started cooking with
1:35:15
the variety of potatoes that come out of Peru.
1:35:19
When I was there, I was told that they have 510 varieties of potatoes.
1:35:24
So, I’m always exploring new opportunities.
1:35:29
I love soul food.
1:35:30
I love creating soul food in different ways to present it.
1:35:36
I don’t think there’s any food I haven’t tried.
1:35:39
I’m not very good at Middle Eastern cuisines.
1:35:44
That’s just because I haven’t done it enough.
1:35:46
I like all kinds of foods and I try to at least experiment
1:35:52
with as many as I possibly can.
1:35:55
I want to go back a little into depth about your participation in
1:35:59
the Civil Rights Movement, just to be a little bit more specific, because
1:36:07
in terms of exactly what you did do and did you participate in demonstrations.
1:36:15
If you did, what was the experiences you had?
1:36:18
Responses of people.
1:36:20
Go into more detail of exactly the activities you did and
1:36:27
how others around you...?
1:36:30
I think probably most often it was a protest march.
1:36:36
As I said, it wasn’t just civil rights.
1:36:37
It was also the march against the war in Vietnam.
1:36:41
There were several in downtown Portland.
1:36:44
March to city hall: do this, do this, do that.
1:36:47
I was on campus getting my master’s degree of social work and there were
1:36:51
many organized protests that came out of Portland State that I participated in.
1:36:56
I remember most often that I was involved in letter writing or petition signing.
1:37:03
I wonder sometimes where are all those petitions?
1:37:05
Are they filed away someplace with the FBI?
1:37:09
There was a much more organized effort to collect our voices, to take
1:37:15
a position on an issue back then.
1:37:19
I wasn’t able to participate in the march on Washington in 1963, but I
1:37:26
was riveted to listening to that and then following that with letters that
1:37:31
the president needed to act on those issues that had been identified.
1:37:36
My own memory was that I made more, my voice was more heard in that process
1:37:43
than it was in anything else was that actually agreeing to signing a
1:37:49
petition or developing a petition,
1:37:53
sending a letter, and they were letters.
1:37:55
We didn’t have email or anything like that at that point in time.
1:37:59
Getting an organized group to talk about let’s all sign this letter together.
1:38:04
Did you participate in organizing those groups or were you organized
1:38:09
by someone—how did that work?
1:38:11
Yeah.
1:38:12
I don’t ever believe that I was the organizer.
1:38:16
I participated in those groups that were organized, and you’d get
1:38:23
the notice that on this Saturday we’re going to be on this block in
1:38:27
downtown Portland and we’re going to be demonstrating in front of ABC & E.
1:38:31
I remember being a part of that.
1:38:32
I don’t think I was ever the leader organizing it.
1:38:37
How did you get the notice?
1:38:37
A variety of ways.
1:38:38
You’d get them in your box at school.
1:38:42
Sometimes you would get them at church—outside of church.
1:38:45
Not in church.
1:38:47
Down at the beauty salon there would be flyers brought in.
1:38:52
There just a variety of kind of, what you call, kitchen ways of communicating
1:38:57
at that point of time because none of the current ways existed.
1:39:00
Where were you living at that time?
1:39:03
When I was a student at the graduate school of social work I
1:39:06
was living, let’s see that would have been on northeast Ainsworth.
1:39:12
That was my first home when I came back from Germany.
1:39:17
During the Civil Rights Movement, that was in the early ‘70s, or ’68.
1:39:23
No.
1:39:23
It was in the ‘60s.
1:39:24
’64, ’65.
1:39:27
No.
1:39:28
Because I graduated from the University of Portland in ’64, so I would have been
1:39:31
in Germany ’65, ’66, so I was coming back from about ’66 to about ’72 that would
1:39:37
have been the Civil Rights Movement.
1:39:40
That’s my phone.
1:39:41
Just ignore it.
1:39:43
I remember...
1:39:44
Do we need to stop?
1:39:48
Okay, let’s keep rolling.
1:39:51
Let’s just, can you answer that question again?
1:39:54
Okay.
1:39:56
Because you got the phone, right?
1:39:58
The ringing.
1:39:59
Yeah.
1:39:59
Right.
1:40:00
Uh-oh.
1:40:02
Standby [phone noise in background]
1:40:10
. Ready?
1:40:12
We’re still rolling.
1:40:13
Okay.
1:40:15
Just answer that question again.
1:40:16
Yeah.
1:40:17
So, I returned to the United States in 1965, ’66.
1:40:24
The Civil Rights Movement was just getting underway in the United States
1:40:28
of America, and it went all the way through 1972, which is when I got my
1:40:34
master’s, my actual degree, was in 1972.
1:40:37
I’m pretty sure it was ’72.
1:40:40
During that period of time, I would call myself a student activist, even though
1:40:48
I wasn’t a student all of that time.
1:40:51
My colleagues either were students.
1:40:53
We all sort of thought the same way.
1:40:55
We were involved on one level or another with SNCC, with CORE,
1:41:02
the NAACP, less so with the Urban League for me at that point in time.
1:41:07
There were just all these activist organizations that participated on
1:41:10
some level or another organizing people to have their voice be heard,
1:41:14
and that’s what I was a part of.
1:41:18
What do you think the movement accomplished in Oregon?
1:41:23
In Oregon.
1:41:24
I would probably say Oregon was impacted by what happened at the federal level.
1:41:31
During that period of time, we had the Civil Rights Act, which
1:41:34
actually was signed into law in 1964.
1:41:38
The affirmative action equal opportunity policy in 1965.
1:41:43
The voting right act 1965 as well.
1:41:47
All of those federal policies affected what Oregon was doing and needed to do.
1:41:52
So, it wasn’t because of what the Oregon state legislature was doing on its own.
1:41:57
It was impacted by all of those changes at the federal level.
1:41:59
As a consequence, they did change some Oregon law.
1:42:03
The director of affirmative action, for example, was directly related to
1:42:07
the fact that Lyndon Johnson had signed the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative
1:42:11
Action Law, public law 96272 I think the number is, passed that into law.
1:42:18
It was applicable to all contractors.
1:42:20
As a consequence Oregon passed some laws to implement that kind of legislation.
1:42:26
It wasn’t Oregon’s initiative.
1:42:27
It was what was happening at the federal level.
1:42:30
How do you think this has affected your life through the years?
1:42:34
Oh, more doors were open to me as a consequence of the Civil Rights
1:42:37
action, the federal legislation and what happened in Oregon.
1:42:42
I never would have even thought about working for the governor
1:42:45
of the state as a child.
1:42:48
I don’t think anybody in my family would have talked about it.
1:42:53
I don’t think anybody in our church community would have said are you
1:42:57
interested in working for the governor?
1:43:00
I definitely know I would not have been the director of a state agency
1:43:03
if it was not for all of the civil rights activity, both at the federal
1:43:07
level and at the state level.
1:43:09
So, many, many, many doors were opened to me as a consequence
1:43:13
of the activity in civil rights in the United States of America.
1:43:19
I think in a way you’ve answered this question, but maybe you have
1:43:22
something more to elaborate, is comparing the Civil Rights situation
1:43:28
today to the past in your life.
1:43:37
Sure.
1:43:38
I think the way to answer that is not from a civil rights perspective.
1:43:42
I think it’s from a human rights perspective.
1:43:46
I think we’re much more tolerant of behavior that is inexcusable
1:43:51
in the United States of America.
1:43:54
It definitely impacts people who are different, but I
1:44:00
believe we are insensitive.
1:44:02
I believe we’re callous.
1:44:04
I believe we allow language to be used that
1:44:10
is mean spirited.
1:44:14
We would not have allowed a veteran to be attacked by the president
1:44:19
of the United States of America 10 years ago, but we allow it today.
1:44:26
So, it’s beyond our commitment to equal rights and civil rights.
1:44:32
It is our lack of humanity towards each other that’s really eating
1:44:38
around the edges of us as a people.
1:44:41
If we don’t stand up, and I say we, I mean everyone stand up and
1:44:45
say this is no longer acceptable.
1:44:48
It has got to stop and we are going to hold people accountable.
1:44:52
If we don’t do that, we are going to have a sore that has festered out of control.
1:44:57
My concern is when are we all going to stand up and say enough.
1:45:01
Stop.
1:45:02
But it’s way beyond civil rights.
1:45:04
It is our lack of humanity towards each other.
1:45:08
Why do you think this has happened?
1:45:10
I don’t have a good answer to that.
1:45:14
People say maybe it’s always been there, and then once we had the
1:45:19
successful election of an African American president it just all exploded.
1:45:23
That
1:45:25
may be.
1:45:26
I don’t know.
1:45:28
I believe it’s a lack of leadership.
1:45:31
I believe when there was the cross burning in Milwaukie, Oregon, and Governor
1:45:38
Atiyeh held a press conference the next morning and said this is unacceptable
1:45:43
and I’m going to take some action.
1:45:46
I don’t think we see that today.
1:45:48
I think it’s going to require that.
1:45:55
Well, I could ask you what else, what still has to be done [laughs] . I
1:46:01
know you’re kind of working on that.
1:46:03
Yeah.
1:46:03
Lots.
1:46:04
I am an eternal optimist, which is why I’m a professional social worker.
1:46:08
It’s why I have
1:46:12
committed my life, my life’s journey to this work and to this population is
1:46:18
because I believe there is a light at the end of a tunnel and it’s not a train.
1:46:23
I believe that we can do what needs to be done.
1:46:28
I believe that we will be better.
1:46:34
What’s most concerning is that there will be a struggle for us to get
1:46:37
where we are to where we need to be.
1:46:41
As a very last question,
1:46:45
as you look back on your life what stands out most in your memory?
1:46:51
That’s a big question.
1:46:55
I’ll answer it this way, that if I had a magic wand what I would wish for
1:47:01
everybody is that they had the loving, caring, supportive parents that I did,
1:47:07
because who I am, the core of who I am, is directly related to the upbringing,
1:47:13
child rearing, and the love that I had from Ben and Mary Rose Steen, my parents.
1:47:19
What were the best parts of your life, those that were, what were the best parts?
1:47:28
My children and my grandchildren, without a doubt.
1:47:34
Why is that?
1:47:35
They’re just the joy.
1:47:36
Just watching this new life emerge that becomes someone that
1:47:46
expresses experiences and shares the joy and pain of life.
1:47:51
It’s just a joy for me to see.
1:47:53
It’s just a high point.
1:47:55
I’m watching that happen with my little 2-year-old right now, my
1:47:58
2-year-old grandson, just watching how he’s a sponge and he enjoys the
1:48:05
richness of life and how he shares the things that are troubling to him.
1:48:11
I just said, every child should be like Harrison and every Harrison should have
1:48:18
this wonderful support system around him that’s a teacher, that loves him,
1:48:22
that cares for him, that teases him, that plays with him, and watches him
1:48:28
just evolve as a kid and eventually as a young person and a young man.
1:48:35
There’s just great joy in the natural things of life.
1:48:38
I don’t need the chocolate covered strawberry
1:48:46
[laughs]
1:48:46
. What was not so good in your life?
1:48:47
Oh, obviously when I got married.
1:48:50
I was getting married for the long-term, wanted a long-term
1:48:54
relationship, wanted my kids to have the joy and experience of both parents
1:49:01
forever, and that didn’t happen.
1:49:04
Is it a disappointment?
1:49:06
To some degree, but it definitely has been a life learning experience,
1:49:09
that life doesn’t always turn out quite the way you plan.
1:49:14
What would you have done differently, if you could?
1:49:18
I don’t know that I would have done anything differently.
1:49:20
The reason I say that is I have learned from those things that have not turned
1:49:25
out well and I’ve learned from the things that have turned out well.
1:49:29
To say I would have done something differently would have prevented
1:49:32
me from a learning experience.
1:49:34
So, I believe what has happened to me was supposed to happen to me.
1:49:39
My challenge and the gift is how do you learn from it, Kay?
1:49:44
How do you move on?
1:49:47
One last question—what would you say are the, maybe you’ve said
1:49:51
this already, I’m not sure, but highlights and disappointments?
1:49:55
We look at the different times of your life, your early childhood, your
1:49:59
adolescence, and your middle age, and I’m going to say older age, but
1:50:05
as far as I’m concerned your kind of still in just very active age.
1:50:11
[Laughs]
1:50:14
. So, the question is?
1:50:16
What are the highlights, your kind of highlights and disappointments
1:50:18
of the various stages of your life?
1:50:21
I see them as really 3, because you’ve not reached older age at all.
1:50:27
Yes.
1:50:27
I think for my early stage in life having the rich experience that I did
1:50:35
in my schools, in my school experiences.
1:50:39
The fact that very early in life I was challenged with having to be
1:50:44
around young people who were different than I, moving from a predominantly
1:50:48
Black community to a predominantly White community and having the skill,
1:50:53
and some of that may be natural.
1:50:55
I don’t know, and knowing how to relate to that and maintaining
1:50:58
some of those friends even today.
1:51:01
In my adulthood it’s a variety of things.
1:51:03
One of my avocations, we really didn’t talk about this a lot, you know travel.
1:51:07
I have been able, I’ve been blessed, to travel to 17 countries.
1:51:11
That has been just a rich, rich experience.
1:51:15
To experience these different cultures, these different people, learning how
1:51:19
to hear what people are saying who are different, listening to people
1:51:25
ask my questions that could be a bit agitating, but they want to know.
1:51:35
There’s a quirkiness about me about, I love going to ancient civilizations,
1:51:41
why were some of these ancient civilizations so advanced, in a lot
1:51:45
of ways more so than we are today?
1:51:47
What was that all about?
1:51:49
What can we learn from that?
1:51:51
That’s been one of my joys, is to come back and reflect on wow, I met
1:51:58
people in Central America that took me to this museum that had these
1:52:03
sculpted stone heads, Black men, that are 20’ tall and 18’ wide.
1:52:11
Wow.
1:52:11
I’ve never heard of that before.
1:52:13
The Olmecs.
1:52:15
Who did it and why did they do it and where did they come from?
1:52:18
I’m still struggling with trying to get an answer to those kinds of questions.
1:52:21
So, that’s one of my highlights is being able to travel to these different
1:52:24
cultures and have this rich experience of seeing something that’s totally different
1:52:28
than anything I would have imagined.
1:52:31
As I get older, being in good health.
1:52:33
Being able to travel with my grandchildren.
1:52:36
You know, my granddaughter and I we went to Europe together.
1:52:40
My grandson, to Montreal.
1:52:43
Just being blessed with the good health to be able to be a part of their lives
1:52:48
and have them be a part of my life.
1:52:52
Well, thank you very much.
1:52:53
I know that there’s way lots more things you could tell us, but for this
1:52:58
interview, I think we can say we...
1:53:00
It’s a wrap [laughs]
1:53:03
. ...we’ve learned a lot, learned a lot.
1:53:04
Is there anything else you want to add or ask us?
1:53:09
No, just to thank you and the Oregon Black pioneers for taking it on.
1:53:14
What this does for me is makes me reflect on many of the things that
1:53:19
have happened to me in my lifetime that I think will make it a much, I don’t
1:53:23
want to say easy, but it will be a much more enriched experience as I put
1:53:28
it to paper, as I write my own story.
1:53:30
So, you’ve made me think about some of the ways to approach that, some of the
1:53:33
ways to think about it, and some of the ways to go maybe a bit deeper and sharing
1:53:40
this story that I might have thought.
1:53:43
I don’t want to be surface.
1:53:44
I don’t just want to tell a story.
1:53:46
I want to talk about the meaning of the things that have happened to me
1:53:49
that makes this story really important.
1:53:52
Well, thank you very much.
1:53:54
Thank you.
