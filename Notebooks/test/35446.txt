00:00
This is an interview with Robert Boyer at his home in
00:05
northeast Portland on October 22,
00:15
2019.
00:16
What we really want to do here in this interview is kind of a life history,
00:21
obviously we can’t really do a life history in a few hours, but we want to
00:28
get not just general but specifics about your life and we’re mainly interested in
00:36
your experiences of living here in Oregon.
00:42
But, also interested in, and we know you come from Philadelphia and how you
00:47
got here and some of the differences.
00:50
Let’s just start out with let me ask you where you were born, where you
00:57
grew up and tell us just a little bit about that background and then we’ll
01:04
go into next step of how you got here.
01:09
Well, I was born in Philadelphia in 1939.
01:14
I got here two weeks early, so I messed up my mother’s Thanksgiving holiday.
01:20
I was born on Thanksgiving Day.
01:24
I was the youngest child, I was the only child, but I was the youngest child in
01:29
the family for about 8 or 9 years, so I had the older part of my family, my
01:38
grandmother, grandfather, great aunt,
01:43
and cousins.
01:46
I was the youngest one, so I had to grow up listening and strict discipline
01:53
until I went to, I was the only kid in the neighborhood; we were
01:58
the only African American family in the neighborhood at that time.
02:02
So, the nuns would see my playing with the other kids.
02:06
We had Italians on the south side of the block and Irish on
02:12
the north side of the block.
02:14
All the kids went to Catholic school.
02:16
The nuns saw me playing and then went and talked to my mom and convinced
02:21
her to send me to Catholic school.
02:24
So, I went to St. Malachy Elementary School from the first to the eighth
02:28
grade and the nuns would keep me after school because my mother was
02:33
one of those maids that made $5 a day and 25, 30 cents car fair.
02:42
They knew that she made minimum wage.
02:48
So,
02:51
after school they gave me a snack and made sure I did my homework, and
02:55
until I went to the eighth grade.
02:58
Then I went to an all-boys Catholic high school, a Roman Catholic high school for
03:02
boys and I started going there in ’54.
03:07
I graduated in ’58.
03:10
Then, I developed running track.
03:14
I was real good in track and high hurdles.
03:19
I also started going to the 23rd PAL, called the PAL of
03:24
Champions in north Philadelphia.
03:27
Out of that PAL six years.
03:30
Joe Frazier came out of there,
03:35
Sonny Liston, Bone Crusher, Tim Witherspoon, Larry
03:42
Holmes used to come up there.
03:44
I began to meet a lot of the champions, and they expressed to us about
03:53
discipline and the reason why we train, the reason why you just don’t get
03:59
up one morning and get in the ring.
04:02
A champion shouldn’t fight without training.
04:05
So, I learned that discipline, how to prepare.
04:09
When I graduated from high school, I had four years of math, four years of
04:18
science, and four years of language.
04:21
So, I took Latin and French.
04:24
When I graduated in June, I got a job in July and it was a
04:30
buddy system in the Air Force.
04:33
A couple of my buddies, I talked to them about Army, Marines, Navy,
04:38
and they said well, Air Force is probably the best because my hobby was
04:41
fixing all the radios in my family.
04:44
I had little cathode-ray tubes that you could test.
04:49
Then you go from one phase to another and after it didn’t phase
04:53
the amperage, then you would check that out with a tube tester.
04:57
If enough amperage didn’t go to one phase it either had to be the
05:03
tubes or cold solder joint, if the sound didn’t come out the other end.
05:08
Well, I used to fix all the radios in the family.
05:12
When I took my test in the Air Force, they told me—I went to a class before I went
05:18
into the service at, it was called, Drexel Institute had had a class for electronics.
05:27
They taught us about electronics.
05:28
So, when I went in the service I already had that knowledge of electronics.
05:33
Unfortunately, I took a bypass test to show your knowledge in certain areas,
05:43
and dog gone it, I didn’t have to go to tech school Biloxi, Mississippi,
05:49
so I just went in communications on
05:53
the job training, because I had the knowledge and I knew about
05:57
the names of the tubes and all that kind of electronic stuff.
06:04
I started working on multichannel transmitters and receivers in Texas.
06:08
in the Air Force?
06:08
In the Air Force.
06:11
I stayed two years in southwest Texas.
06:15
What years was that?
06:16
That was ’59 and ’60, or a later part, or early part of 1960.
06:24
Then they sent me into British Columbia, top secret radar
06:29
site around Canada, mid Canada.
06:33
There, we could identify the altitude and direction and the speed of aircrafts.
06:40
After aircrafts got past the early warning system in Alaska,
06:46
if we couldn’t identify, we could identify the speed, the direction,
06:51
and altitude of aircrafts unknown.
06:55
Well, we found out.
06:56
If not, on the other side of the 15 minutes we had the ability to
07:00
pull the Nikes out of the silo.
07:03
We had to guard McChord and the submarine base in Barrington.
07:11
That was our job.
07:13
Then, they said, well, Boyer you’re going to Portland.
07:17
I said, alright.
07:18
Well, it’ll take me about 2 hours, two and a half hours to get to Philly.
07:22
No.
07:23
You’re going to Portland, Oregon.
07:25
Oregon?
07:25
So, it was 5 of us.
07:26
Said, where’s Oregon.
07:29
They said that little state between California and Washington.
07:33
Said, well.
07:35
I got here in ’61 and just fell in love with the state.
07:38
A big difference from Philadelphia.
07:42
One of my friends said, yeah, well, we have a million and
07:46
a half people in Oregon.
07:49
Right?
07:50
We have a million and three quarters in Philly, so
07:55
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
07:56
Since I’ve been here in Portland, Portland has blessed me.
08:02
So, when you first came here, then you were released from the—
08:08
Air Force.
08:08
Got my discharge.
08:09
I didn’t go back to Philly.
08:11
So, then, where did you strike out to live and what was the process of
08:17
trying to find a place and stuff?
08:19
Well, I had no problem finding an apartment.
08:21
One of the nurse’s husbands, his name was Alfred Richardson, and he had an apartment
08:30
and so his wife introduced me to him.
08:34
He said, yeah, Boyer when you get ready just let me know.
08:39
So, when I was discharged, I paid I
08:44
think four or five month’s rent ahead of time.
08:46
It was only $50 a month for a studio apartment.
08:55
I had transferred from communications to vehicle maintenance in the Air Force
08:59
because I fell in love with the ’62
09:03
Pontiacs [laughs] . Of course, I bought one.
09:05
But I learned how to work on cars.
09:10
When I was discharged, I started working at a car lot, or at a mechanic’s shop.
09:19
Then at that time they had a Black racing club called the Chevrons.
09:26
All the members had a Chevy, so we all had, I had one, too.
09:29
I
09:31
was, those, a lot of people had stick shifts, so we had to put in
09:39
pressure plate and if anything was wrong was that we put in the clutch.
09:44
So, I started doing that and a lot of the guys on the air base they needed cars.
09:50
They wanted nice cars.
09:52
So, they would call me.
09:54
I would tell them we put a new pressure plate and a new clutch in a
09:58
Chevy or a Ford or Pontiac, whatever.
10:02
They would go to the car lot.
10:04
I would give them the license number and they would pick the car out.
10:07
So, the owner, Max Agner, came to up the mechanic shop and
10:12
said who’s this Bob Boyer?
10:14
I said, me.
10:15
Well, you’re selling more cars working on them than my salesman.
10:18
How about coming down and becoming a car salesman?
10:24
So, I became a car salesman at Sagna Motors at Union and Fargo.
10:29
I did that for a year and then I started working at the shipyard as a sand
10:37
blaster and ended up being a painter.
10:42
I worked on sand blasted the ships.
10:45
Oregon shipyards was closing down, so I sand blasted ships and
10:53
then painted them and then also I went on the St. Johns Bridge.
10:57
I sand blasted St. Johns Bridge and painted it.
11:03
Then people liked the way I worked.
11:05
I had that work discipline.
11:07
You never know who’s watching you and who’s looking at you.
11:12
So, one of my foreman say, Boyer, how much education do you have?
11:17
I said, well, I got, I was a math major in high school and I was a technician
11:23
in the Air Force then a mechanic.
11:26
He said, well, look, the Southern Pacific Railroad is looking for
11:33
some African Americans as a test, we wanted at least 10 and my brothers
11:40
one, and I’d like to recommend you.
11:43
I went down to the train master’s office in my red lead, talked to them, and he
11:52
said, well, you really want this job.
11:56
So, we’re going to give it to you.
11:59
We want you in Eugene at the hump yard at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
12:05
Well, I went home and about, so I started working on my car,
12:10
make sure I could get down there.
12:15
I got a phone call.
12:16
The clerk said, Boyer, did you know anything else about railroading?
12:21
I said, yeah, I used to lay track temporarily when I got
12:24
laid off from the shipyard for the Northern Pacific Railroad.
12:28
So, I was a real John Henry.
12:30
I pounded those spikes for $2.50
12:33
an hour.
12:35
He said, well, you don’t have to go to Eugene.
12:39
You just go to the Brooklyn yard, because you have your railroad watch.
12:44
You have your schedules.
12:46
Then
12:49
you have laid track, so you know the basic functions of the railroad.
12:56
I said, yeah.
12:57
He said, well, why don’t you come to Brooklyn yard instead of going to Eugene?
13:02
I went to Brooklyn yard and I started.
13:05
In 90 days, I got promoted to a foreman.
13:09
So, I was a yard foreman for the 77th railroad for 5, 6 years
13:14
before I went on the waterfront for
13:18
30.
13:20
On the railroad I got tired of getting laid off in the wintertime.
13:26
If the river would raise up you couldn’t take a train across the
13:30
steel bridge because the water’d be too high because ships couldn’t get
13:37
under it.
13:37
I worked as a casual on the waterfront for 18
13:45
months.
13:46
Then I got hired.
13:47
I worked graveyard.
13:50
As
13:52
a casual, low seniority, you go anywhere they tell you to go.
13:58
I worked in Camas in 1968.
14:00
I worked in West Linn.
14:02
I worked at Wauna, Oregon.
14:07
Different places that the tug boats would pull the barges.
14:10
We had to unload the barges.
14:12
Worked in Astoria at the Bumblebee factory.
14:17
It gave me a better understanding of how Oregon was laid out.
14:25
After working there almost 30 retired, I retired.
14:29
At the same time,
14:32
I showed some leadership ability.
14:36
That’s what they told me and so they also paid for my
14:40
education, my college education.
14:44
I was able to, I asked the top management to point out the classes they’d want
14:50
to see in a supervisor in management.
14:55
They told me public speaking,
15:02
analysis of different situations, how to solve problems, accounting, and marketing.
15:13
So, I ended up with a degree in business management from Marylhurst.
15:18
I never dreamt that I would graduate from a Catholic elementary school,
15:24
an all-boys Catholic high school, and then graduate from a Catholic college.
15:29
Marylhurst was an all-woman Catholic college when I started in ’67.
15:38
It changed when I got there.
15:41
Were you the only man?
15:42
No.
15:43
At that time there was a few of us, probably 3 or 4 of us, and then
15:51
it changed when a lot of the graduates from Portland Community College started
15:56
coming there and other colleges.
15:58
We went and approached the board of directors and board of regents, saying
16:03
how are you going to call this Marylhurst school for Catholic college for all
16:09
women and we got all these men here?
16:11
So, they changed the name in later part of, I think it was
16:16
the winter of ’74, changed it.
16:19
I graduated in ’77, so I was the first African American male to graduate from
16:24
Marylhurst and probably one of the top 3 males to graduate from there
16:34
then.
16:34
Let’s go back, then,
16:39
to, well, before we go back, let’s talk a little bit about
16:43
your experience in the college.
16:45
So, you were one of the very few men.
16:48
Were you also one of the very few African Americans as well?
16:53
Yes.
16:53
RK: Was there, what were the relations like with the
16:57
students and the teachers, the
17:01
social relations?
17:03
Well, one of the things, when I first was interviewed there and
17:10
talked at the classes, all I was saying I worked for Crown Zellerbach.
17:16
The folks didn’t know I was a labor person.
17:20
Many of the discussions, I would come up with a solution to the
17:25
problem that they were talking about that they had with the workers.
17:29
Not until I graduated they found out I was a worker.
17:33
I wasn’t management.
17:36
But, getting along with the students I had to be focused.
17:41
So, I was working different ships.
17:45
I had already finished Portland Community College for five years,
17:49
because my working different shifts I couldn’t have continuous classes.
17:56
I had to take a class.
17:59
I missed one or two sessions and then I would pick up another one.
18:05
That’s why it took my 5 years at PCC.
18:09
I started out my junior year at Portland State.
18:14
I went there and then into my senior year, I went to Marylhurst.
18:23
I got my last 30 hours at Marylhurst.
18:26
[Break in recording]
18:29
. Okay, so now, let’s go back to then when you first arrived here.
18:38
Just in very short words, give
18:43
a few little incidents of what was different about Portland and Philadelphia.
18:52
Okay.
18:53
Well, number one when I got here I found out that the state
18:58
population was a million and a half.
19:00
In Philadelphia itself was a million three quarters.
19:04
Then the African American community was very small.
19:11
When I say very small, so I decided to the history.
19:16
I checked with the census bureau, find out at Portland State I was the only
19:20
African American Boyer in the state.
19:24
Then, the African American community was, at that time, was 18,000.
19:30
I went to the census printout and saw that they had catalogued by
19:37
numerical, the different years that African Americans was there.
19:41
By that time in ’61 it was 18,000, according to the census.
19:46
In Philadelphia, we have 30 houses, three stories high on one side of the street.
19:52
So, 18,000
19:55
folks would be about 10, 11 blocks, or 12 blocks in north Philadelphia.
20:01
Well, since I was an only child and I could get along with different
20:06
groups of folks, so, I started making friends and getting along with people.
20:15
Working at the shipyard I learned, I met many of the large families, like
20:22
the Allens and the Kellys and the Browns and so forth, the Mangnums.
20:30
I got to meet many of the men who had 5, 6 kids or more.
20:36
There were the big African American families?
20:38
Yes, who worked at the shipyard.
20:41
Then, I still wanted to continue my training as a boxer, so I went, now
20:49
it’s called Matt Dishman Center.
20:50
Then it was Knott Street.
20:52
Everybody called it Knott Street.
20:53
That was a converted athletic building from an old elementary school.
21:01
So, I got to know a lot of the guys.
21:06
So, I had told them that I knew more about Knott Street boxing team than
21:11
I knew about the city of Portland.
21:13
They said what do you mean?
21:15
I said the Knott Street boxing team traveled.
21:19
Oh.
21:20
I said, yeah they traveled to different states, to New York, to box, and different
21:25
places that we also went at Philadelphia.
21:30
Well, the 23rd boxing PAL in Philadelphia was known as the PAL of Champions.
21:39
Now, let me explain that.
21:41
A lot of champions came out of there.
21:43
For the last 50 plus years, there’s always been somebody from Philadelphia,
21:50
23rd PAL in that top weight class either champions or in the top 5 or 10.
21:57
They are still doing that now.
22:00
Here in Portland I got to meet the different families, and the
22:07
people knew I was respectful.
22:10
So, us Air Men, we used to give skating parties at the Imperial Skating Ring.
22:17
So, we got to know a lot the other folks here.
22:21
Then we had a racing club and we met a whole bunch of other folks.
22:27
At that time, in the mid ‘60s they started the War on Poverty programs.
22:33
The one I first joined was called the War on Poverty Program and then it was
22:39
Portland Metropolitan Steering Committee.
22:42
Then I was the youngest person elected to the model cities program.
22:47
Then we brought in Head Start.
22:49
I came up, I matured here in Portland, on non-profits.
22:55
Tell us a little bit about those programs and what each of them was.
22:59
Well, the War on Poverty program, it was to give the folks, it was
23:04
under the umbrella of President Johnson’s War on Poverty.
23:10
Never won a battle, but it was called War on Poverty.
23:14
It gave the African American community an opportunity to move up the ladder
23:20
with their administrative expertise.
23:23
As folks started moving up the ladder and they were able to buy
23:28
homes and get their education.
23:32
A lot of folks associated with it today, that’s where they started.
23:37
In fact, one of my friends, Senator Jackie Winters, she started in the
23:44
Model City—well, this was one of her jobs in the Model Cities Program.
23:48
We met her then.
23:51
Then,
23:55
one of our African American city Counselman, Charles Jordan,
23:58
I was on the committee that hired him out of California.
24:02
He did well here in Portland.
24:05
Well, I had the opportunity to meet a number of the politicians.
24:10
I was able to meet Ron Wyden, Senator Wyden when he was with the Gray Panthers.
24:17
Then I became a precent person, then a district leader in the Democratic Party,
24:24
then eventually ended up being chairman of Multnomah County Democratic Party.
24:30
A lot of the politicians who was on the city council, county commissioners,
24:35
and representatives and state senators, I knew when they started.
24:42
I mean, like Earl Blumenauer and so forth.
24:45
You see how people grow.
24:48
At the same time, I grew.
24:52
I could call someone a politician and they would either, their staff
24:57
or they would call me back, because I enjoyed giving them, I didn’t, at
25:03
my age now, I don’t give bad advice.
25:07
When governor, when Kate Brown was running for state rep and then
25:11
when she ran for state secretary of state, and when she ran for governor.
25:16
We were friends all that time back County commissioners.
25:23
I knew Deborah Kafoury’s mom Gretchen Kafoury, so she was our state rep.
25:30
But at the same time, I moved up the ladder of making, we call it networking.
25:38
I enjoyed that, but this was one of the classes I had in college that
25:43
really stuck with me, is networking and organization, learning different people.
25:52
When I got in labor as working the shipyard then working at the railroad,
26:01
then working on the waterfront, with all those 40 years in organizing labor.
26:07
So, at the present time, last 14 years I’ve been working with a
26:13
pre-apprenticeship program training young men and women how to get into the trades.
26:19
That has broadened my perspective, my network.
26:24
After I retired from organizing labor in ’94, or
26:33
’95, since there’s a program called, I was saying, Model Cities, I was the
26:39
youngest person, well, we got together, the committee, and we wanted to have
26:44
citizens’ input of what was going on.
26:48
So, we created the Neighborhood Associations.
26:53
The city, especially Neil Goldschmidt, mayor Goldschmidt, enjoyed that so
26:59
much, saw the positiveness of it.
27:02
So, it went from 9 neighborhood associations to over 90.
27:07
This gives citizens an opportunity to make a presentation, take some
27:13
of their plans to the city council.
27:15
First they would get neighborhood support.
27:18
Then they would go to the other neighborhood associations in their
27:22
unit and then they would go as a unit with getting citizen input
27:29
to the mayor and the city council.
27:32
They would listen to them.
27:34
The fact that you were an African American, did that, in what ways that
27:39
influence your networking process and people’s attitudes towards you?
27:47
Well, one of the things I found out from a kid, is that if you had ability
27:53
and people recognize that, so when I ran track in Philly, people recognized
28:01
that and talking about the ability.
28:04
When I became a boxer, when you get in the ring, it’s not who you are or who
28:08
you look like, it’s what you can do.
28:10
So, I learned those lessons.
28:14
Whenever I got in a debate, I’d say I’ll make sure I prepare just like in the ring.
28:20
You do your sparring and you prepare for the big fight
28:23
and you go in with knowledge.
28:28
I like to use athletics when I’m trying to explain different issues to folks.
28:36
For instance, when you’re in life and you’re at a situation, at a
28:41
point, and then I bring in athletics and say well, you get to kick off
28:47
and you’re at the 15-yard line.
28:50
You look back and see you’re at the 15-yard line and you
28:52
see how far you have to go.
28:55
Then after 3 plays or 3 years or 30 years, whatever, you say
29:01
well now I’m up to the 50 or 55.
29:04
I see how far I have to go and look back and see how far I’ve come.
29:09
Using those athletic characteristics is what has driven me, been my
29:16
support in politics, in neighborhood associations, and in life.
29:27
That’s interesting.
29:29
Now, what about your, we were sitting here in your home with your wife.
29:34
So, I do know that at some point in your life you established a family
29:40
and maybe more than one, I don’t know.
29:43
Would you like to tell us a little bit about your family life and your
29:48
children and that part of your life?
29:52
Well, Judy and I just celebrated our 38th wedding anniversary.
29:59
I courted her for 2 years.
30:00
I always say 40.
30:03
She has been a blessing to me,
30:07
family, foundation, we have had a property management business for almost 40 years.
30:15
We have rentals.
30:19
My children, my youngest daughter’s a Ph.D., vice principal
30:22
in one of the high schools.
30:25
One of my daughters has a beautician business for the last 20 years.
30:36
The children
30:39
have been a blessing and grandchildren and great grandchildren.
30:46
We’ve had a blessing.
30:49
It’s been a blessing for marriage.
30:52
So, how many children do you have and is this a first marriage or second marriage?
30:58
Well, this is my third and we had 6 biological and 18
31:07
grand, and 21 great grand.
31:10
Can you keep track of them?
31:12
Oh, yeah
31:15
[laughs] . At different holidays or Christmas we buy gift certificates
31:19
that way we don’t get them mixed up.
31:23
So, we buy
31:26
our grandchildren, if they have great grandchildren, we buy a
31:31
gift certificate for the family.
31:33
Then, the older ones we give them individual.
31:38
It’s a blessing.
31:42
We have a whole, well, now, 4 generations here in Portland.
31:50
Yeah, getting here in ’61 and children, grandchildren, and
31:56
great great grandchildren and me.
32:01
That’s a lot.
32:03
What changes do you think have been taking place from one generation to another?
32:08
Well, I look at electronics.
32:12
I can recall very clearly the computers we worked on in the
32:17
‘50s, those huge monsters.
32:20
Smartphone right now, if you had the same applications and memory on the
32:26
computers in the ‘50s, you’d need an 18-wheeler to pull all that, because
32:33
the memory on those computers in the ‘50s was reel-to-reel tape and
32:42
the input.
32:43
This room right here is just big enough just for data entry and that was paper,
32:54
punch cards, things like that.
32:58
Then, each unit had to have an air condition, because the tubes would heat
33:04
up, cathode-ray tubes would heat up.
33:07
We could, to fix a computer in the ‘50s took us less than 10 minutes.
33:14
Of course, they were built like the units on
33:19
a stereo system.
33:21
We would pull one unit out and put another unit in, but make sure the amperage was
33:27
transferrable from one unit to another.
33:32
Youngsters they ask the questions, well, I’m in Vancouver and you’re in Portland.
33:38
This radio station I can get down as far as Burnside and I
33:44
can’t get this station anymore.
33:46
Well, that’s because of the atmosphere.
33:49
Atmosphere, what do you mean by the atmosphere?
33:51
Well, the ionosphere in the daytime is higher.
33:55
It comes down lower at night.
33:58
Then, it angles.
33:59
The vibrations on the crystals vibrates.
34:05
Oh.
34:05
Well, we didn’t know that.
34:06
It plays a big difference.
34:08
You’re surprised you’re driving the car you get one station in Portland.
34:14
Then you get to southeast you don’t get it, but at nighttime
34:18
you can maybe pick it up in Salem.
34:25
Let’s go back also, then, to your first place that you lived was
34:31
in a little studio apartment.
34:37
What part of Portland was that?
34:38
That was northeast Portland, right at Union and Fargo.
34:42
Union and Fargo.
34:43
That’s what you said, yeah.
34:45
Then, tell us a little bit about each place where you lived and why you moved
34:50
there and who was with you and what was—
34:53
Okay.
34:54
Well, we moved at 14th Place and Emerson.
34:56
I was able to buy a house for $6,000.
35:03
My down payment was my sweat equity.
35:05
I was already a painter.
35:08
So, my first wife and I we bought that.
35:11
$85 a month for 10 years.
35:15
Then I bought my second house at Mallory and Killingsworth.
35:20
That was $11,500 in 1971.
35:25
At the present time, they built four $500,000 townhouses right next to it.
35:37
So, that went up in value.
35:40
Then, my third house I bought at 15th and Going, and I bought it
35:46
for $50,000 in I think it was ’79.
35:52
I just sold it a couple years ago.
35:54
I paid $50,000, and sold it for almost $400,000.
35:57
We’ve seen the growth, for
36:01
instance when I moved to my first studio apartment at Union and Fargo,
36:07
then I was able to join a group of people and we changed the name from
36:11
Union Avenue to King Boulevard.
36:15
We’ve seen growth in the community.
36:19
As the youngest person on the Model City Planning Board, and we’ve seen the
36:23
growth of Head Start, because it was only, Model Cities was only supposed
36:29
to be a 5-year demonstration program.
36:32
But look at Head Start is still here.
36:35
So, I grew up on War on Poverty program, so non-profits.
36:44
I’m still on a non-profit board, a couple, Constructing Hope.
36:49
We train young people how to get into the construction trade.
36:53
I usually give or I have a time that
36:59
the director let me give orientation to the new students and then I usually give
37:04
closing remarks at their graduation.
37:08
Last
37:11
week they needed 1,000 carpenters here in Portland, 1,000 electricians, 1,000 sheet
37:17
rock, 1,000 roofers because the growth.
37:21
There’s over $3 billion worth of growth construction going on in Portland.
37:27
We were the premiere pre-apprenticeship program in the city of Portland right now.
37:35
We average 25 students, 3,
37:40
4 times a year.
37:43
When we graduate those students, some stay.
37:47
A few may drop off.
37:49
But they go right into the apprenticeship program.
37:54
We have the
38:00
itinerary of the trades that we work by.
38:05
There are certain things, first think you know we teach them safety.
38:09
Then we teach them how to identify the 2’x4’s, 2’x6’s, 2’x12’s.
38:18
Then we go on field trips, where they’re building a building, so they
38:24
can identify what the people are doing.
38:28
A lot of youngsters have, do not understand the jargon for electricians.
38:36
For instance, there’s heavy electrical and low.
38:41
Young ladies come up to me and say, yeah Mr. Boyer, our dad told
38:46
us about becoming electrician and we don’t know the difference.
38:49
We don’t want to climb any poles.
38:51
Said, well, if you don’t want to climb your poles, that means
38:53
you want to go to low voltage.
38:54
What is low voltage?
38:56
Oh, that’s security.
38:58
Oh, you can put in security systems.
39:00
Oh, okay.
39:01
And they graduated and they expressed to their trainers what they wanted
39:06
to do, and they made sure that they put them in low-voltage.
39:13
It’s so much that these youngsters they miss, especially in mathematics.
39:20
I was telling Greg, it’s kind of strange, because when I got here
39:26
I said how do these kids graduate without 4 years of math, 4 years of
39:31
science, or 4 years of language, but that was college prep back in Philly.
39:37
So, here the youngsters say well I talk to them about, I give a class on fractions.
39:43
Say, fractions?
39:45
What are fractions?
39:45
I said, when’s the last time you took a fraction?
39:47
Oh, we took that in the fourth grade.
39:50
I didn’t understand it then.
39:51
I don’t understand it now.
39:53
So, are the people that are participating in this program, is there a, I know
40:02
it’s not going to be many because of the ratio of actual African Americans
40:07
and Whites that live here, but does it have an over-representation
40:12
of African Americans or?
40:15
It’s half.
40:15
What are the demographics?
40:17
It’s about 50%.
40:19
We’re a 501[c][3], so we accept all the students who come in here.
40:26
We had students come down from Longview.
40:29
Every day they were never late.
40:30
We had kids coming from Corbett.
40:34
Was never late.
40:36
Kids come up from different areas, Gresham, whatever.
40:42
We say we have a good relationship with the northwest labor council,
40:48
with the different trades.
40:51
We have trade people form the trades come in at certain times.
40:56
We’re talking about surveying, heavy equipment, electrical,
41:01
carpentry, roofing, framing,
41:09
steam fitting, plumbing, all the trades are represented and their now board,
41:16
which I’m on the board last 14 years, are made up of representatives from
41:21
Hoffman, which is the largest construction company in the state of Oregon.
41:26
Then business agents from electrical, from labor, from plumbing, and then they
41:33
have an opportunity to come and give a presentation so the youngsters, I can call
41:39
them youngsters, the young people, so they can understand what they’re getting into.
41:44
Then we also explain to them that if when they go through apprenticeship they
41:49
have to keep a record of what they do, because say for instance, they say well, I
41:57
really, I want to go to a warmer climate.
42:01
I want to go to Florida.
42:02
Well, they have to take that apprenticeship tracking
42:09
where they need to go.
42:10
Or, if they become journeyman people, then we call our travelers.
42:15
They can take their travelers and go to other cities and states.
42:20
With the boom, the building boom here in Portland, it’s fantastic.
42:26
We’ve had some of our graduates end up becoming contractors.
42:33
Kids they call back, oh, Mr. Boyer, we’ve finished our journeymanship
42:40
and now I’m working as a contractor.
42:43
I’m doing this.
42:44
Thanks for all the help.
42:48
I’m going to kind of veer away a little from this aspect and ask
42:53
you a little more about your social life, what are your interests?
42:57
What do you do for recreation?
43:00
I don’t suppose you box anymore?
43:04
[Laughs] I still exercise.
43:06
I take Tai Chi.
43:08
So, I do that not for strength.
43:10
That’s for flexibility.
43:12
When
43:15
I got into my 70s, no problem bending down but the problem was getting up.
43:21
Those joints say, hey, okay it’s time to quit.
43:24
But I’m still on 3 or 4 boards.
43:28
I just stepped down from being the commander of an organization of
43:33
veterans called NABVet: National Association for Black Veterans.
43:39
We help veterans get their benefits.
43:42
Then, I’m on the board of Constructing Hope.
43:46
This is my fourth, fifth year because I just, carpentry was my hobby and
43:54
then I’m at church, my church life.
43:59
Then, I’m on the board for property tax appeal for Multnomah County.
44:05
This is my 10th year doing that.
44:09
Then as a whole, I call old statesman, well, I used to be a state senator.
44:15
I took Senator Bill McCoy’s place when he died because the
44:20
wife and I we were involved in a program called Operation Big Vote.
44:23
We were going down registering people to vote and we helped create District
44:32
18.
44:32
Senator Bill McCoy, no State Representative Bill McCoy.
44:36
Then, got appointed by the Multnomah County Commissioners to be state senator
44:42
over two representative districts.
44:44
People knew me from going around knocking on doors, getting people
44:48
registered to vote, and certain issues, like changing the name of Union Ave
44:54
to King Boulevard, so they knew me.
44:59
Then they knew that whenever I got involved in an issue,
45:05
I would do my homework.
45:08
I began speaking at different opportunities, and so people
45:14
began to understand that I had some political background.
45:18
Tell us more about that, your whole life in politics.
45:23
Well, when I first got involved in politics
45:29
was in the mid ‘60s.
45:32
Emanuel Hospital decided to expand and Portland Development Commission was their,
45:44
end up being a nemesis in the community.
45:49
Well, Emanuel Hospital’s on the west side of Vancouver at
45:57
Morris and Stanton, the hospital.
46:02
They wanted to expand.
46:04
So, PDC decided—
46:07
What is PDC?
46:09
Portland Development Commission decided to demolish 167 homes on
46:16
the west side of Vancouver from Fremont all the way down to Russell.
46:21
So, when they did that, I knew some of my friends had homes and lived in that area.
46:28
So, we were able to contact some folks in the community and we created a
46:34
program, an organization called the Emanuel Displaced Persons Association.
46:41
They created that, and so many of the people were renters.
46:46
The few people that owned their homes, we saw in the mailer that if a home owner
46:55
had to be displaced because of a hospital, a school, a freeway, something like that
47:02
they could get a $5,000 relocation grant.
47:06
Some of my friends, I talked to them, and they said, yeah we will do that.
47:12
They didn’t want to get a low price on their home at that time.
47:17
I made a presentation before Mayor Schrunk and the city council and recommended that
47:26
they do something to help the people.
47:29
Portland Development Commission put two trailers at Vancouver and
47:33
Ivy to help the folks transfer from their home in the Emanuel
47:42
area that they were going to demolish and gave them a little money to
47:47
move other areas of the city.
47:51
I got involved in that.
47:53
Then, registered people to vote and then we were able to, we were at
48:02
that time, I started going to PCC.
48:06
No, it was Cascade Christian College.
48:10
I said, well, a little money if followed the students going from our
48:15
local high schools, I think it was Jeff [erson] and Roosevelt, Benson or
48:23
one of the other schools.
48:25
The little money followed them.
48:28
They could get little scholarships to go over to PCC.
48:32
I said, well, so I talked to the director of the Model Cities Program,
48:37
Charles Jordan, said, since we meet here, it’s in the community,
48:41
why don’t we change the name.
48:44
I talked to the director of
48:53
Portland Community College, said we need to name this your Cascade campus.
48:58
He says, well, I don’t know.
49:00
I says, well, our next meeting.
49:03
So, I went and lobbied the folks in my community who were representative
49:08
on the Model City Planning Board, and they brought the question up.
49:13
We’re going to change this to PCC Cascade Campus.
49:17
So, we were able to change the name.
49:22
What was it in yourself that made it possible
49:30
for you to take on these leadership roles?
49:32
Somebody else comes to Portland, they have a similar background to yours.
49:37
Then, you know, you go and live in your neighborhood and you have your
49:40
family and you go to church and do whatever you do for recreation, but
49:48
you don’t have whatever that is that makes you be active, to take leadership.
49:57
Well, one of the things that happened, I think after becoming a yard foreman at the
50:05
Southern Pacific Railroad, I take the work environment that I’m in and I transferred
50:13
those characteristics to other situations.
50:17
For instance, when I build a train going to Eugene, I had to make sure that if we
50:25
have to drop off 10 cars in Salem that they would be on the end of the train.
50:32
See, a breakman is just a switchman on the road.
50:37
The way we build trains, we build them according to stops.
50:43
So, if I had one in
50:48
Woodburn or Brookings, or Kaiser, they would be on the
50:54
end before they got to Salem.
50:57
So, it would be easy for a switchman to unhook the trains and drop them off.
51:03
Well, I look at, that’s the way I try to solve problems and look at situations.
51:09
Where is the most serious problem?
51:17
I look at problems like hurdles.
51:20
When hurdles are on the front of you, that’s how I become a high hurdler.
51:25
You have to jump over the most serious problem first.
51:30
For instance, when I talk to young kids, and they say, yeah, Mr. Boyer,
51:34
well, this is what I did at King facility for the school district.
51:39
These
51:42
youngsters coming in for,
51:46
at that site we had state juvenile probation and the
51:50
county juvenile probation office.
51:53
If I didn’t know the kids, I knew their parents or their grandparents.
51:58
If the kids come in with their pants sagging, I would stop them and explain
52:03
to them why their pants were sagging.
52:03
The thing I would tell them,
52:07
I said, you know what a penguin is?
52:09
Yeah, I know.
52:10
You ever seen a penguin run?
52:13
Yeah.
52:14
They can’t run fast, can they?
52:16
That’s why the big whales eat them up.
52:20
Oh.
52:21
I said, now you ever kids getting shot?
52:24
Getting hit?
52:25
Because they can’t run.
52:27
Oh.
52:29
Well, I tried to give them a situation where they can understand
52:36
the lesson I’m trying to tell them.
52:39
So, the parents would come in say Mr. Boyer thank you.
52:42
I’ve been trying to talk to that boy
52:46
[laughs] , and thank you for explaining to them.
52:48
Or, when I taught the Sunday kids about being tough.
52:54
I said, you’re real tough, huh?
52:56
Yeah.
52:57
I said, okay.
52:58
Ever knock anybody down?
53:00
No.
53:01
Ever knock anybody out?
53:03
No.
53:04
How many fist fights you have?
53:05
Oh, 4 or 5, 3 or 4 whatever.
53:08
Oh.
53:09
You ever had about over 50.
53:11
No.
53:12
People ever try to take your clothes?
53:14
No.
53:15
Well, the lesson is you need some knowledge.
53:19
So, if you want to be a fighter, you need to get in the ring.
53:23
That’s where you need to fight at.
53:25
But if you want to gain knowledge and respect, this is the people you
53:32
have to associate yourself with.
53:35
Oh, because look at all your friends who are hard headed.
53:40
Look where they’re at.
53:41
They’re doing time.
53:43
I don’t want you to do that.
53:44
You have to go another way.
53:47
I try to use life experience to explain to young people how they can do better.
53:54
I find myself as being a senior, a senior is to pass on knowledge
54:03
and then most of all understanding.
54:06
So, I try to do that.
54:10
It sounds like from the very beginning you
54:14
had that part of your personality was already there leading the way.
54:28
In jumping back, you lived in these different houses that you’ve bought
54:36
and lived in.
54:40
They were all in the northeast area of Portland?
54:45
North and northeast.
54:46
Uh-huh.
54:49
Tell me about the different neighborhoods where you did live and
54:53
what it was like living there and who you were living with at those
54:57
times, your relation with neighbors.
55:01
Well, from my first house to this one, we lived in four or
55:11
five different houses.
55:15
Being the only child, I knew it’s better working with your neighbors.
55:20
You don’t have to love your neighbors.
55:22
You need your neighbors, because if your house is on fire it’s your
55:26
neighbors if you’re at work then they would call the fire department.
55:32
The skills I would gain, for instance when I was working at
55:36
the railroad I got laid off.
55:40
Like I told you, I was tired of getting laid off in the wintertime.
55:43
Well, my neighbor, his name is Ralph, he said Bob, you’ve been
55:51
laid off work.
55:51
I said, yeah.
55:52
He said, I know you can go down there and work with me.
55:57
I straightened out bumpers.
55:59
So, I started doing that.
56:01
I said, it’s always nice to get to get to know your neighbors, have a cup of coffee
56:05
with your neighbors, because if you have a certain problem, they can help you.
56:10
For instance, when I was cutting grass on my lawn, another neighbor said, hey
56:16
Bob, I see you got that hand edger.
56:18
Yeah, well, why don’t you borrow my gas edger.
56:22
People would come and help you out.
56:25
Some of the kids, they knew I enjoy working on cars
56:30
because we had a racing club.
56:32
They would come on over and ask me about how to fix a car,
56:38
how to change a carburetor,
56:44
so, I took a class at Portland Community College how to rebuild
56:48
carburetors, four-barrel carburetors.
56:51
Well, we needed that because we were racing.
56:55
Then, they found out how to put oil in the rear end and take
57:02
out the technical part of cars.
57:06
You learn that by observation.
57:10
When I would look at the
57:14
master mechanic at the shop, he taught me a lot of things.
57:20
So, that was one environment.
57:23
In another environment
57:27
I took a class on woodworking from a master carpenter.
57:31
He was about 83.
57:34
He showed me how to build a deck.
57:37
At the time on the waterfront, you called a dunnage, a 2’x4’, I mean 2’x6’s.
57:43
It would happen one end of the 2’x6’ would be crushed, well maybe that was 9’.
57:52
I laid out my deck for 7’,
57:57
2’x6’.
57:57
So, what are you doing with all those 2’x6’?
58:00
We’re throwing them away.
58:01
I said, I was seeing them throw away.
58:03
They had nails and whatever.
58:07
I got permission and the slip to take them home, pulled the nails out, cut
58:12
the bad ends off and build a deck.
58:16
The master carpenter showed us how to take 3 dimensions to get
58:21
our permit, and how we should have blocks under the deck for support.
58:28
He taught us how to build a deck and so that increased
58:34
the market value of the house.
58:36
That was it.
58:38
Then,
58:42
I wanted to put a - learning people in the neighborhood to get acquainted.
58:47
I wanted to put a dryer in my basement.
58:52
Well, one of my neighbors said, hey, look all you have to do is go down to
58:56
Sears, get a book and take the type of box that you have, your electrical box,
59:06
and they probably have a book on that.
59:09
Well, I went down.
59:11
A salesman told me what I needed to do.
59:15
My neighbor told me how, what kind of ¾” plywood I should put
59:20
on the board to put a female plug.
59:23
So, I say, well what is, how come it looks different from the regular AC plug?
59:31
They said, well that’s 240.
59:34
What’s 240?
59:35
Yeah, that’s for the dryer.
59:36
That takes more amp-age to run it.
59:39
I said, mm. He said, that’s not.
59:41
He said, what did you do in the service?
59:42
I said, well, communication.
59:43
He said, well you just put them together.
59:45
What?
59:46
Yeah, that’s a gang switch to a
59:52
120 [laughs] , and here’s the switch.
59:53
I put that in, and put in the plug and it worked.
59:59
So, that’s why I said you don’t have to love your neighbors;
1:00:03
you need your neighbors.
1:00:06
I began to learn the names of all the neighbors on my block.
1:00:13
When we created the neighborhood associations, that’s who I went to.
1:00:17
I talked to the people and they got on our board and in King Neighborhood and
1:00:26
Vernon and Humboldt.
1:00:31
So, when we put the Neighborhood Associations together,
1:00:36
this is how I was able to
1:00:43
say collaborate.
1:00:47
So, from that I ended up meeting the different pastors of the churches.
1:00:54
I began to explore and learn the different individuals in the community.
1:01:03
That helped me grow.
1:01:10
Let’s go back a little.
1:01:12
You were senator during what years?
1:01:15
’96.
1:01:16
From ’96.
1:01:17
Yeah, I took Senator Bill McCoy’s place when he died.
1:01:22
So, was it for, then did you run again?
1:01:24
No.
1:01:25
When I found out that, after experiencing traveling back and forth to Salem,
1:01:33
and the money that they paid, I couldn’t afford the cut in pay.
1:01:39
I just filled his spot.
1:01:41
Just for a year.
1:01:44
I didn’t want to run again.
1:01:47
So, when he, so then you did run for a whole election, I mean you went through
1:01:54
the whole process of an election.
1:01:57
No.
1:01:58
I got appointed.
1:01:58
You were appointed.
1:01:59
Yeah, I was appointed.
1:02:00
That’s why I only did that for a year.
1:02:02
Ah-ha.
1:02:03
That was ’96.
1:02:03
That was the largest exodus of state senators in Oregon history,
1:02:11
because then they were talking about having the extended period,
1:02:16
because it was every other year.
1:02:20
A lot of the state senators, when Goldschmidt was
1:02:24
speaker of the senate then.
1:02:26
Then he went on to run for U.S. senator.
1:02:30
Many other senators were business people and lawyers, that they
1:02:32
had to go back to their jobs.
1:02:35
At that time, I was working for the school district as a manager.
1:02:44
Tell us about that, your work with the school district.
1:02:47
Well, at the King Neighborhood Facility was a collaboration of a number of
1:02:57
organizations that got together in the ‘70s through the Model Cities Program
1:03:03
to build a facility where we could more or less house the different non-profits.
1:03:12
So, we were able to
1:03:16
get the DeNorval Unthank., Dr. Unthank’s son.
1:03:20
Dr. Unthank was our third African American doctor in the state of Oregon.
1:03:25
So, DeNorval was his son who was in Eugene.
1:03:29
We were able to persuade him to come up here and draw the plans.
1:03:34
So, he drew the plans for the King Facility, which was on the south
1:03:39
end of King Elementary School.
1:03:42
Then, the city, PDC, knocked down some houses, so we could have a parking
1:03:50
lot and close off Wygant Street, that went all the way to Union Avenue,
1:03:58
build a King Park extension of, just to have a nice park to go through.
1:04:05
They also built a tennis court, a tennis court right there.
1:04:14
James Loving was the first manager for the King Neighborhood Facility.
1:04:20
Then, Mr. Ford, Charles Ford, and then when I retired out of organized labor,
1:04:28
Charles Ford and some other people came and persuade me to throw my hat
1:04:33
in the ring to be manager, and this was
1:04:40
’95.
1:04:41
So, I got
1:04:46
hired to be the manager of the King Neighborhood Facility.
1:04:49
I did that for 10 years.
1:04:51
There we had state juvenile probation, Multnomah
1:04:58
County juvenile probation.
1:05:00
We also had a community courtroom.
1:05:03
Then we had northeast coalition office.
1:05:08
Then we had the neighborhood mediation.
1:05:10
Then we had 3
1:05:13
cubicles that we could rent to small non-profits that couldn’t
1:05:21
afford the brick and mortar.
1:05:23
They would be stationed there.
1:05:27
There also we had, I’m
1:05:33
trying to think of the name—not Black educational center.
1:05:42
Becky Black had a program there that she trained the youngsters.
1:05:47
It was an after school program for educators.
1:05:51
They trained the kids.
1:05:54
I’m trying to think of the name of it, but then different
1:06:00
organizations would come in.
1:06:01
We had the NAACP for a while.
1:06:04
We had all the organizations, now have SCI in the building.
1:06:12
It was part of the facility was for temporary non-profits and before they
1:06:22
went on they got to brick and mortar.
1:06:24
We had neighborhood meetings there.
1:06:28
We had, different organizations had socials there.
1:06:33
It had a nice courtyard and we could have different activities
1:06:37
in the courtyard for folks.
1:06:39
We arranged, at that time, we was able to get the money from HUD to build it.
1:06:46
Then after 20 years it transferred to the city, but the school,
1:06:54
Portland Public Schools, had the janitorial and management.
1:06:59
It doesn’t belong to the school district.
1:07:02
It belongs to the city.
1:07:08
When you had socials and you did those activities, was
1:07:10
this mainly African Americans?
1:07:13
Was it a mixed group?
1:07:14
No.
1:07:16
it’s for everybody.
1:07:17
Then different organizations have meeting space.
1:07:21
They come in there and ask for meeting space.
1:07:23
Then, when I was there we had the opportunity to have the Good in
1:07:27
the Hood had come to the community.
1:07:30
Well, Paul Knauls is my hero here in town.
1:07:36
Him and one of the
1:07:39
national blues singers, Norman Sylvester, said, Mr. Boyer we would
1:07:45
like to have the Good in the Hood here.
1:07:49
I said, okay what do you need?
1:07:52
What is the Good in the Hood?
1:07:53
Good in the Hood is, we have, it’s 3 days.
1:07:57
We have food.
1:07:58
We block off 6th street and we have food.
1:08:02
We have 20, 30 different performances by all types of folks, from dancers
1:08:11
to Native American, to different blues
1:08:19
entertainers that come in, different song entertainers.
1:08:22
We have step dancing.
1:08:24
It was a big community picnic.
1:08:26
We have a parade, and the last few years we’ve been marching from
1:08:33
Williams and Russell all the way down to King Boulevard, then up King
1:08:39
Boulevard all the way up to Alberta.
1:08:42
Then we swing around and go down to King Park.
1:08:48
So, at King Park we have 2 stages there.
1:08:53
Then we have a beer garden under a tent and then we have different vendors.
1:09:00
People come in with vendors, and that’s city, state, different organizations
1:09:06
come in there for information and sales.
1:09:12
Then they have an area for kids to come and play in the park.
1:09:18
Would you call that bouncing unit?
1:09:22
Oh, and then they paint kids’ face and then my organization, we can
1:09:30
purchase an area, national Association of Black Veterans and the Urban
1:09:38
League, the city water, whatever.
1:09:43
Different venues that people can come and get information from and
1:09:47
it's usually 20 to 25 of those.
1:09:53
Then people have tents and tables for sale.
1:09:57
So, all kinds, all different ethnic groups.
1:10:03
Does that happen now?
1:10:04
Yes.
1:10:05
Is that once a year, then?
1:10:07
Yes.
1:10:07
That’s once a year.
1:10:08
When does it happen?
1:10:09
That’s in?
1:10:11
What’s that May.
1:10:12
I think that’s in May or June.
1:10:20
So, it’s a big community?
1:10:21
Yes.
1:10:21
Yes.
1:10:22
Thousands and thousands of people.
1:10:24
It’s in here in Portland?
1:10:25
Yeah.
1:10:26
Then, what do you call it, the parkways, all the kids ride
1:10:31
their bikes up different areas,
1:10:36
the kids and their parents riding bikes and they have an area that
1:10:41
they bike in, and so King’s one of the areas that they start in.
1:10:49
That brings in a kind of cohesion—
1:10:51
Yes.
1:10:52
—in this whole northeast area?
1:10:55
Mm-hm.
1:10:57
Well, the summer, too, when they have different marathons
1:11:00
when people run through the community or the bridge to bridge
1:11:05
[laughs] . That’s neat.
1:11:06
That’s neat.
1:11:07
Tell us a little bit more about your church, what church you
1:11:12
belong to and the activities?
1:11:15
Well, at the present time the wife and I, my wife grew up in a Lutheran church.
1:11:23
We go there every Sunday and then my wife has the largest Sunday
1:11:26
school class at the church and
1:11:32
it’s called Trinity Lutheran.
1:11:34
But we’re also at Holy Cross Lutheran where I became the
1:11:38
president of the congregation.
1:11:39
Just a few years ago, you never know who’s watching you, found out that
1:11:46
the head of the board of regents was member of our congregation, and
1:11:51
he also was the head of the senate.
1:11:57
So, he liked some things I was doing.
1:11:59
I was completing projects around the church.
1:12:02
He said, Mr. Boyer I’d like to nominate you for a committee.
1:12:07
I said, okay.
1:12:07
I didn’t know it was the member of the senate.
1:12:09
Well, folks didn’t know me at the other churches.
1:12:13
So, he came back and I had been the president of the Concordia
1:12:17
neighborhood association.
1:12:19
Their finance person and one of their art teacher was on the board at Concordia.
1:12:27
They recommend me and he talked to me and, so he said, Bob I’d like you to
1:12:31
come to this meeting Saturday meeting.
1:12:35
I said, okay.
1:12:36
I went to the meeting and said yeah this is chairman of the
1:12:42
senate and the board of regence.
1:12:44
I’d like to nominate Bob Boyer for board of regents, and he’s here
1:12:52
[laughs] . I got a unanimous vote.
1:12:54
So, I’m looking, I said, yeah this tough boxer out of north Philly,
1:12:58
this labor man on the board of regents on a Lutheran University?
1:13:02
Then it was Concordia College.
1:13:06
We were on the board of regents there for 9 years, helping to give scholarships
1:13:10
to young people and okaying budgets.
1:13:15
I had background in how to analyze financial statements, those
1:13:19
types of things and management.
1:13:21
I had the credentials, and young kid come out and said Mr. Boyer I
1:13:28
heard you’re on the board of regents.
1:13:31
Said, yeah.
1:13:31
I thought only Ph.D.s and millionaires.
1:13:33
I said, well, I’m a millionaire in property and I’m a Ph.D. in the community.
1:13:38
Oh, okay
1:13:47
[laughs]
1:13:47
. That’s what it sounds like.
1:13:47
Right.
1:13:47
I have 3 generations graduated from Concordia—my wife, my daughter,
1:13:51
and one of my granddaughters.
1:13:59
Talking about community participation, so during the Civil Rights Movement
1:14:02
in the ’60s and ‘70s and things that were going on here, what
1:14:06
was your participation, if any, in that?
1:14:06
One
1:14:12
of the things, I think it was, must have been
1:14:21
in the early ‘60s,
1:14:24
some kids were raising a little stand on the union avenue.
1:14:31
So, I was with the Model Cities Program and the Portland Metropolitan
1:14:35
Steering, so I got in my car and some of the kids that I knew personally, I
1:14:42
would pick them up and take them home.
1:14:44
Said, hey, you don’t need to be out here.
1:14:46
You don’t need to be out here.
1:14:49
So, we had a committee that met with police department.
1:14:55
I said, look, your police officers don’t know the folks in the community.
1:15:00
You need to get out and have a walking patrol, so you can get to
1:15:04
know the folks in the community.
1:15:09
The mayor agreed.
1:15:11
Then,
1:15:16
I was saying I was one of the, either the Urban League or NAACP filed a suit
1:15:22
against the Southern Pacific Railroad and
1:15:30
Longshoreman.
1:15:30
So, I was one of the first 10 Black men to do, besides land tracking, cleaning
1:15:37
the engines, become a switchman, brakeman, or fireman at the railroad.
1:15:42
That was ’64.
1:15:46
The guys down there,
1:15:50
we broke the myth that we didn’t know how to
1:15:57
run trains and become switchmen, put them together.
1:16:01
I said you got to be crazy.
1:16:04
When I would talk to the guys at the station, I said,
1:16:07
well, don’t you guys read.
1:16:10
Oh, I said, well, who you think put the coal in the engines?
1:16:16
Put the wood in the engines?
1:16:18
It’s why they’re called fireman.
1:16:21
Because you look at the mode of operations, especially on the
1:16:24
wagon trains, now who brought the pioneers over to Oregon?
1:16:28
Because they were giving away land, they sent them back.
1:16:32
Oh.
1:16:34
I said, well, who you think John Henry was?
1:16:37
Who pounded those spikes?
1:16:39
You didn’t.
1:16:40
Oh.
1:16:42
Now, you call smitties in England the people who pounded the steel
1:16:47
and the iron, but here you come to America they call them blacksmiths.
1:16:52
Oh.
1:16:54
Said, well, who do you think did all the work for Thomas Jefferson in Monticello?
1:17:01
Oh.
1:17:01
Who was his lead carpenter?
1:17:04
So, I said let’s open the book.
1:17:09
It’s right there in front of you.
1:17:13
When I all of a sudden there on the job, not only the truckers but the
1:17:20
local guys would come to me and ask me, Boyer, what about such and such?
1:17:25
Well, if I didn’t read the book I would come back and
1:17:29
explain to them about the book.
1:17:33
One theory—truck drivers would come in and have over 100 trucks.
1:17:41
So, we got trucks coming all day, all day, and I was the terminal foreman
1:17:46
and I always made a fresh pot of coffee for the truck drivers, so the
1:17:49
guys knew my name, especially after they come back on the run, a local
1:17:53
run, statewide run, or a national.
1:17:57
They’d come in, hey, where’s Mr. Boyer?
1:17:58
Where’s Mr. Boyer?
1:17:59
Mr. Boyer, what about this?
1:18:01
So, one of the guys come in, and he was out of Texas.
1:18:05
He had his cowboy hat and cowboy boots, a truck driver, and said, oh, man, he
1:18:11
said, these cowboys having problems.
1:18:13
I said, what do you mean?
1:18:14
You truck drivers have all the hats and boots.
1:18:17
We started laughing about it.
1:18:19
So, one of the guys said, yeah, well, that’s a straight-knee [?] cowboy.
1:18:25
I said, yeah, sure is.
1:18:27
Said, you wouldn’t call that.
1:18:30
Guy said, what do you mean?
1:18:31
I said Caucasian wouldn’t call cowboys.
1:18:34
They would call cow men, the cattle men association.
1:18:38
But when those African American start learning how to twirl those guns and
1:18:44
shoot and become sheriffs on posse, the term sheep boy, house boy, I
1:18:53
dare you call me a cowboy and I’m 6’4” with a 44 magnum on my side.
1:18:58
But when the name got popular, here you get a dollar a day
1:19:04
riding behind a herd of cattle.
1:19:06
You didn’t do that.
1:19:07
You had other people doing that.
1:19:09
But when it got popular, then you started doing that on the Chisholm
1:19:13
Trail and things like that.
1:19:15
Then you say, okay, you can call me a cowboy.
1:19:19
How you know that?
1:19:20
I said, the book.
1:19:23
Riding horses in the Pendleton Round-Up, all that kind of stuff.
1:19:29
Go ahead and check who’s the statues up in Pendleton?
1:19:33
Bill Pickett and all those guys.
1:19:34
Oh.
1:19:36
Well, he was what?
1:19:37
He was a bronco rider.
1:19:39
He rode the bulls.
1:19:40
You know what he did to submit the bull?
1:19:43
What?
1:19:43
He bit his nose.
1:19:45
Oh.
1:19:46
I didn’t know that.
1:19:46
Well, there's a lot you don’t know.
1:19:49
The thing about it is so, I found all of a sudden I was thrown in
1:19:54
a position of explaining things.
1:19:58
So, when I went down on the waterfront before they made me a foreman and
1:20:04
when they made me a foreman, it looked like everybody was Missouri,
1:20:07
show me... hey, Boyer, we want you to show me things or show me that.
1:20:13
I was able to do it.
1:20:15
Say, okay, okay.
1:20:17
So, they made me foreman on graveyard because I was unloading those trucks.
1:20:26
See, you have to have a layout how you put those 4,000 pound rolls of paper that
1:20:35
goes to the Oregonian, because if you don’t load them right when those trucks
1:20:40
turn the corner, it’ll topple over.
1:20:45
Right.
1:20:45
Something the older guys showed me how to do that, so I wrote a
1:20:48
book of all the different ways that you would load the paper.
1:20:55
Then, we don’t use feet, we use cubits on how you load the railcars.
1:21:06
So, certain areas you can get so many on the floor.
1:21:11
If a railcar needed 500, I would know you had to have so many on the floor.
1:21:18
So, you knew.
1:21:19
So, I wrote that down.
1:21:20
I had a little book.
1:21:21
So you knew.
1:21:25
Okay, with going to work with the Southern Pacific Railroad, I found
1:21:30
out it was either the Urban League or NAACP who helped me get in.
1:21:34
So, I had allegiance to that group.
1:21:38
We start going to the meetings, and then they had meetings in different
1:21:43
cities I started going to, and, so, they said well, Boyer don’t mind traveling.
1:21:51
There was an election, and I got elected as vice president of Pacific
1:21:59
Northwest for the NAACP and the president was Judge Johnson out of Seattle.
1:22:05
So, he would say, well, here I got this labor man I know he got my back.
1:22:10
Then, we prepared for the 1978 National Convention here in Portland of the NAACP.
1:22:19
I got elected as a chairman of the finance committee, and so a number of
1:22:26
the cities from Seattle to Burlington to Tacoma to Eugene to Corvallis to Salem
1:22:36
to Portland and I would go to Vancouver, I would go to the different cities
1:22:44
to assist after they had a problem.
1:22:46
One of the problems was
1:22:52
you have 2 lists of members, one local and another list
1:22:59
people who joined the national.
1:23:01
When they would have an election, the local wouldn’t have the
1:23:05
national people on because they would just come out for elections.
1:23:10
They would call me and I would go to Vancouver, and say, well
1:23:14
these people are eligible to vote.
1:23:17
I would go to Tacoma or Seattle or Burlington, places like that,
1:23:22
or Eugene, Salem, and I said, okay these people are eligible to vote.
1:23:30
Then, by being in labor all these years, my hero was A. Philip Randolph.
1:23:36
He was the first African American to be the president of a national
1:23:43
chapter, national Brotherhood of Sleeping Car, Porters, and Redcaps.
1:23:48
We had a chapter here, and Judy was the secretary and I was the president.
1:23:54
That was before we got married.
1:23:55
That’s how we met, at a meeting, labor meeting, trying to explain
1:24:04
to folks why they need to go to the labor union meetings and understanding
1:24:09
and reading their contracts.
1:24:12
So, we had different seminars for national figures coming in town.
1:24:20
But, I’ve come up through the non-profits.
1:24:24
I was always on the board of at least 7 to 8 non-profits before I worked with one,
1:24:31
which was the Portland School District.
1:24:35
During the Civil Rights Activities when there were demonstrations and
1:24:39
so on, did you participate in those demonstrations out on the street?
1:24:44
Oh yes.
1:24:45
Tell us about that.
1:24:46
Give us the picture, describe the whole picture of how that
1:24:51
looked and what you were doing.
1:24:54
One of the things, if there was a demonstration,
1:24:59
I’d go there and get in line and sometimes I would call the cadence of the marches.
1:25:09
What’s the cadence?
1:25:11
Okay.
1:25:12
Kind of forget them now
1:25:16
[laughs] . It was that,
1:25:23
said no peace—I’m trying to think of the name of that you would say.
1:25:32
But it was different cadence that you would say something,
1:25:38
I would come right back.
1:25:42
No peace, no this or no that.
1:25:46
I would make it into a rhyme.
1:25:48
We would talk in rhyme and all of a sudden people on the sidewalk would join in.
1:25:54
If you were demonstrating for a particular issue,
1:26:01
maybe
1:26:05
if we were applying for jobs and gentrification and people didn’t know
1:26:14
why they were doing it.
1:26:15
Well, here, for instance, a guy come to me and said Mr.
1:26:19
Boyer, he says I need your help.
1:26:22
I said, what’s up?
1:26:24
He said, folks call the police on me.
1:26:26
I’m cutting my grass and playing my boom box.
1:26:29
Here’s a neighbor two blocks away walking their dog complaining to the
1:26:35
police about me playing my boom box on my porch and I’m cutting the grass.
1:26:46
I said, okay.
1:26:47
So, I’d say, well, I wrote the policeman, that name down,
1:26:56
and found out he’s out of northeast precinct.
1:27:00
See, the northeast precinct used to be Fred Meyer and they converted it
1:27:05
and that was part of the conversion.
1:27:08
Made some recommendations when they converted it.
1:27:11
The building?
1:27:11
Yeah.
1:27:13
So, we talked to the commander, the watch commander, and said,
1:27:16
well, we need to have a meeting.
1:27:17
So, we had a meeting.
1:27:17
The police officer, the resident, and myself and the commander.
1:27:17
Say, well,
1:27:28
what was wrong?
1:27:29
Why did he come up and talk to this resident?
1:27:33
Oh, the neighbor complained.
1:27:34
Did the neighbor talk to the resident?
1:27:37
No.
1:27:39
Did the neighbor, the one who complained, did they live on that street?
1:27:43
No.
1:27:45
Well, what was the complaint?
1:27:46
Oh, he was playing music.
1:27:50
Do you know what the law is about music?
1:27:53
Or did the police officer know?
1:27:56
I don’t know.
1:27:57
Ask him.
1:27:58
Well, he’s just playing music and the neighbor complained.
1:28:00
Okay, do you know you cannot play loud music after 10:00 p.m.?
1:28:04
Here 12:00 in the afternoon, man cutting his grass and he wants to hear his music.
1:28:09
Why did that neighbor complain?
1:28:11
Why didn’t she come up and ask him?
1:28:13
She was walking the dog.
1:28:16
So, the police officer apologized.
1:28:21
See.
1:28:22
So, those are the kind of things when I was at the King facility, people
1:28:25
would come up with different problems.
1:28:29
One, here, 2, 3 kids was on the porch on a Saturday visiting a house.
1:28:38
This particular neighbor, we called it gentrification, moved in to flip the
1:28:43
house and called the police because the kids were making noise, didn’t know
1:28:49
that that was their grandparents’ house.
1:28:52
Those kids grew up there.
1:28:57
They had been come in there, what 25 years, and the parents bought
1:29:01
the house in the ‘40s, but the person who moved in didn’t know.
1:29:07
Well, here folks and gentrification would buy houses to flip or move
1:29:13
in without getting to know the whole aura of the neighborhood.
1:29:19
We have one street we call Mississippi.
1:29:23
We have a Mississippi fair every year, blocks off about 5 blocks or more from
1:29:30
Fremont all the way up to Skidmore.
1:29:33
25 years ago, folks wouldn’t drive up and down Mississippi.
1:29:39
Now they have nightclubs and cafes, $400,000/$500,000 apartment
1:29:47
townhouses and so forth, and they block the street off and the
1:29:53
people bringing their products out.
1:29:56
So, you have to walk.
1:29:57
You can’t drive.
1:29:58
You walk up and down Mississippi listening to good music, and the funny
1:30:03
thing about it, I was at Sunnyside, Kaiser, getting my feet done.
1:30:09
I used to have my feet done every few months, once every other
1:30:15
year or something like that.
1:30:17
The lady was telling me about
1:30:21
a national musician was playing on Mississippi
1:30:27
[laughs] at one of the venues.
1:30:29
It is very exciting, but I remember the day.
1:30:35
Tell us more about the, you really know the neighborhood, the history
1:30:42
and something also about the way, how people are responding now to the
1:30:49
gentrification, the flipping of houses.
1:30:52
Well, there was a booklet we put together called the Albina plan.
1:30:59
It was financed, Model Cities Program and Portland Developer Commission.
1:31:04
They got a number of us folks together and we started with
1:31:09
9 neighborhood associations.
1:31:12
The city liked the program so much that now it’s 90 neighborhood
1:31:18
associations and there was an ability for people in the community to get
1:31:25
together with their neighbors and complain about a certain issue.
1:31:29
One of the issues we had when Judy and I moved in the neighborhood
1:31:36
had certain drug houses.
1:31:41
The people were complaining when I became president of Concordia Neighborhood
1:31:44
Association, they would complain about here you know their neighbor.
1:31:48
You know they got one or two cars, but if you see a car coming every 15 minutes,
1:31:55
stop, and stay 5-10 minutes, come in and leave, you know something’s wrong.
1:32:02
Well, we found out.
1:32:04
I told her, we need a study group.
1:32:06
Find out what is really going on.
1:32:08
The neighbors come up, say there are different cars coming every 15 minutes.
1:32:16
The people who rent, it’s a rent house, and one of the things they didn’t do,
1:32:21
they didn’t pay for trash collection.
1:32:24
So, here we got these black bags piled up on the side.
1:32:29
So, I called down to the precinct and told them we need a representative
1:32:34
to come down and talk to us.
1:32:37
They sent
1:32:40
Lieutenant Moose.
1:32:42
He came down and he would give us an update.
1:32:45
Said,
1:32:47
this is the houses that we want to look at and we want you to have a cold call.
1:32:54
The police officer would go up, knock on the door, say hello.
1:32:58
Your neighbors think you run a drug house, so we just want to
1:33:01
let you know we’re watching you.
1:33:03
Then that house would move.
1:33:05
The people would move.
1:33:07
It was about over 20 and the people said, no.
1:33:12
Don’t want to go to Concordia, live in that area anymore.
1:33:16
Then, the neighbors was having the meetings at night, 7:00.
1:33:23
At wintertime it gets dark.
1:33:24
So, some of the people who had been coming said the reason why we can’t come it’s
1:33:29
dark plus we got a light out on the porch.
1:33:32
I said, what?
1:33:33
Yeah, our porch light is out.
1:33:36
We can’t get up there.
1:33:37
I went around, there was 5 of them, and start putting new bulbs in.
1:33:44
People even baked me blackberry cobbler.
1:33:49
Little things like that, and all of a sudden, going back to the neighborhood
1:33:55
coalition, they elected me chair of the neighborhood coalition and then from
1:34:01
there they liked what I was doing so I ended up running for state senator.
1:34:06
But, it’s grassroots.
1:34:09
You start at the bottom and work up.
1:34:13
I wasn’t thinking about running for a state senator, but folks know I
1:34:18
had negotiating skills and I cared.
1:34:23
Folks come in to a neighborhood, we call that gentrification,
1:34:28
and don’t know the neighborhood.
1:34:32
Here they see kids doing certain things, well, they don’t know that’s grandkids
1:34:37
or great grandkids and them people been living there 50, 60 years, because
1:34:42
all they want to do, some, come in and just want to flip the house over,
1:34:47
do a little cosmetics and then move.
1:34:50
While they are there, they want to complain.
1:34:55
But, for instance,
1:35:00
when I got here in ’61, there was a million and a half
1:35:03
people in the state of Oregon.
1:35:05
Now, it’s over 4 million.
1:35:08
We’ve definitely seen some changes.
1:35:10
When I got here, the normal lot, housing lot, was 50’x100’.
1:35:17
Now, first the city council changed it to 25’x50’, like back east,
1:35:25
because they didn’t like the density, but with the people moving into
1:35:29
Portland, people’s minds change.
1:35:31
Now, they would take out a house, single family home, on the 50’x100’
1:35:38
lot and build a 4-plex, a 6-plex, or 12-plex or something, because now
1:35:46
we’re talking about housing density.
1:35:49
Well, if you look back in Europe, you’ll see that housing density,
1:35:56
how they built rowhouses.
1:35:59
Folks say, well, we don’t like the term rowhouses.
1:36:01
You don’t?
1:36:02
Oh, they just changed the name.
1:36:04
What do you mean?
1:36:05
They call them condominiums.
1:36:07
Oh [laughs]
1:36:08
. Townhouses or rowhouses.
1:36:10
Mm-hmm.
1:36:13
Yeah, but we’ve seen some changes.
1:36:17
We’ve seen a whole new development just south of the Willamette,
1:36:23
the Columbia River, the infill
1:36:28
that they dug up, made the channel, the river deeper and put all in infill because
1:36:36
when I got here all that was farmland.
1:36:38
The east end of Portland was 82nd when I got here, now look it’s
1:36:43
all the way out to 148th, and looking at expanding into Corbett.
1:36:50
In the Albina District here,
1:36:55
with this gentrification is there any resentment going on that people
1:36:59
are coming in and doing that?
1:37:02
Well, unfortunately—
1:37:03
And it putting people out.
1:37:06
Well, unfortunately, some of the folks who bought their houses less
1:37:08
than $10,000 get offered $150,000.
1:37:15
They go and sell.
1:37:16
Well, then the houses that went up in value appreciation of the retail value,
1:37:27
some of their kids are not making enough money to make the mortgage.
1:37:33
So, you have
1:37:40
different banks or the county foreclosure, people losing houses, people
1:37:48
don’t have the upkeep, property tax.
1:37:52
Now, I sit on a board for property tax appeal, and one of my favorite
1:37:59
most questions asked of seniors coming in, said I haven’t put a gallon of
1:38:06
paint on my house in 10 years, but my house, my property tax went up $300.
1:38:14
Why?
1:38:15
Well, I have to explain to them.
1:38:16
I said, well, you have kids?
1:38:18
No.
1:38:19
My kids are gone.
1:38:20
Grown and gone.
1:38:21
Well, grandkids?
1:38:23
Yeah.
1:38:24
Well, you saw that bond yesterday that came up for the schools?
1:38:27
Did you vote for that?
1:38:28
Yeah.
1:38:28
Well, in the small print it
1:38:33
said for every $1,000
1:38:39
that your property is going to go up $100 or so, no, every $100,000
1:38:46
your property tax will go up $100.
1:38:48
So, if the appraised value of your property is $300,000, then
1:38:59
your property tax will go up
1:39:03
$300.
1:39:03
Oh.
1:39:05
I didn’t read that.
1:39:07
Because I wanted to help remodel the schools or hire the teachers.
1:39:12
That’s been more common questions being asked of seniors.
1:39:16
Well, here it brings tears to a rough guys eyes like me when you hear them
1:39:22
say well, we’re just living on our Social Security and little pension,
1:39:27
and here we have to pay $3,000/$4,000 a year property tax, we have to cut back.
1:39:40
So, I have to tell people they have to watch, they have to watch when they’re
1:39:43
voting for those different issues that will increase their property tax.
1:39:51
When you look down that whole list, you’re paying for Portland Public
1:39:54
Schools, Portland Community, police pensions and so forth and so on,
1:40:01
different organizations that you’re paying for, water bill, and all that.
1:40:06
What do you think they should be doing?
1:40:09
Well, they have to be aware of what’s going on.
1:40:14
Now, people talking about well, the question is should I get
1:40:21
a reverse mortgage or not?
1:40:24
Well, not if you got relatives.
1:40:27
You have to be careful.
1:40:29
There’s so many areas coming in,
1:40:33
because here you have seniors over 80 who’s been paying property tax since
1:40:41
the ‘60s, now they got the carve a little out of their Social Security
1:40:48
each month for their property tax besides their regular life expenses?
1:40:56
Do you have any suggestions for solutions for this problem?
1:40:59
[Laughs] I’ve been talking to some folks.
1:41:04
I’ve been talking to some folks about that.
1:41:07
It’s just conversation right now, brain storming.
1:41:12
Do you want to share any of that with us?
1:41:16
Well, I definitely been saying well, folks who have been paying
1:41:19
20, 25 years or over 80 ought to be cut way back down for them, their
1:41:26
property tax, especially if they’ve been paying over 20, 25 years.
1:41:35
In that same location.
1:41:38
Mm-hmm.
1:41:39
They’ve done paid for that house, that property tax.
1:41:42
That’s right.
1:41:43
That’s right.
1:41:47
Well, I think we’ve been covering many things here.
1:41:54
It’s
1:41:58
probably time to bring us towards an end, because we can obviously go on.
1:42:04
There are many, many more questions and areas that we have, but
1:42:10
to wind this up a little bit,
1:42:15
when you look back at your life, what stands out most in
1:42:22
your memory?
1:42:23
What stands out most in my memory is my wife,
1:42:27
because when we met and had our union, look, everything we touch just blossomed.
1:42:36
She’s been
1:42:40
my backbone and my foundation.
1:42:43
I’ve been a blessed man.
1:42:49
What would you say are some of the best parts of your life
1:42:51
and those that weren’t so good?
1:42:55
Well, all my children.
1:42:57
That’s my best part, seeing them develop, grow.
1:43:04
My youngest daughter is a vice principal of a high school.
1:43:08
Saw her grow all the way up.
1:43:10
My oldest daughter has a beautician business, 20 years or more.
1:43:17
Then here comes the grandkids, are doing well.
1:43:22
Working.
1:43:23
Going to school.
1:43:25
Going to college.
1:43:28
My youngest grandson,
1:43:32
one of my youngest grandkids, started community college.
1:43:37
I have another one, he’s 6’6”, named David.
1:43:42
He went to Southern Oregon for a year.
1:43:46
He got homesick [laughs] . So, he’s back up here in Vancouver.
1:43:53
To see your legacy in these children and whenever they have grandchildren,
1:44:03
the older one if they have a problem they call, grandpa what about is.
1:44:07
The granddaughters, what about this?
1:44:12
I try to find the answer for them or I know somebody who does have an answer.
1:44:18
So, my older grandkids they bought homes, then working with their families
1:44:26
and it’s a blessing to see them grow.
1:44:36
I think as a senior on the doorsteps of 80,
1:44:43
these are some touching moments.
1:44:46
Growing up
1:44:48
as an only child, a lot of times I explain to them how precious it
1:44:53
is to have brothers and sisters.
1:44:56
Say, I don’t care if you fight like cats and dogs with your brother and
1:44:59
sister, but when you get in a corner you know who’s going to come and help you.
1:45:04
It’s family.
1:45:09
I think that’s the blessing, is the relationships you build.
1:45:17
Judy and I, 40 years we’ve been together and that’s half my life
1:45:28
[laughs] . I’ve become a better person
1:45:33
because of that.
1:45:35
So, those are the good parts.
1:45:39
I lost a son at
1:45:45
19.
1:45:45
Got away from me and hung out with the wrong kids.
1:45:51
I told him.
1:45:53
He died in ’85.
1:45:56
That’s the low point, but the high point is with my wife.
1:46:00
Well, thank you.
1:46:03
Thank you very much.
1:46:07
Well, there’s a couple questions I don’t mind to ask.
1:46:12
[Laughs]
1:46:12
So, give us some information about the athletes that you
1:46:14
knew at the University of Oregon
1:46:18
back in the late ‘50s, ‘60s, those eras, and the opportunity to talk about
1:46:27
those gentleman and what you might have gained from them, insights and what
1:46:35
you learned over the years from them.
1:46:40
When I got here in ’61, Mel was still in high school.
1:46:46
Mel?
1:46:47
Mel Renfro.
1:46:49
But, I knew his brother better, Ray.
1:46:52
Tell us about who those people are.
1:46:54
Okay, Mel Renfro was an athlete from Jefferson High School who was top
1:47:03
echelon in the 100, in the state and top echelon in the hurdles in the
1:47:09
state and then he went on to University of Oregon and did well in track.
1:47:14
But, he played Jefferson High School state championship team and then he
1:47:21
went on to the University of Oregon to play football as a running back
1:47:25
and then he went on to the Dallas Cowboys and become a defensive back.
1:47:32
He was fast and he created the whole position called free safety.
1:47:39
That’s a guy—you have a safety on the left, safety on the right.
1:47:44
Mel was in the middle.
1:47:46
Mel was so fast, he could get to have double coverage on a wide
1:47:51
receiver on the left or the wide.
1:47:54
So, he created that position called a free safety.
1:47:58
Then,
1:48:01
I think Dick Daniels went on to Pacific and then he went to the Dallas Cowboys
1:48:06
and played on the Super Bowl team.
1:48:09
Then, Claston Welts, he went to David Douglas, and I don’t know if he
1:48:16
went to University of Oregon or not.
1:48:19
These are guys that I knew who went on to play professional football.
1:48:24
Then, there was a number of other guys here in Portland: A.C. Green went
1:48:31
to play professional basketball, and Brandon, Terrell Brandon, played for
1:48:40
professional basketball, but when we, Judy and I went down to University
1:48:46
of Oregon in the ‘70s it was a program called LERC, Labor Education
1:48:54
& Research Center and going around.
1:48:57
I saw a lot of my friends.
1:49:00
There was a program called
1:49:04
Operation Uplift, or something like that.
1:49:07
That was giving a scholarship to the kids in the neighborhood to have that
1:49:11
college experience, but from my main
1:49:19
athletics it was boxing, and that was back in Philadelphia.
1:49:25
The guys in my neighborhood
1:49:30
we were only making about 75 cents an hour or less.
1:49:36
We would have a little smokers, they call them.
1:49:39
You boxed Monday, Wednesday, and Friday night.
1:49:42
The big money in fight was Saturday.
1:49:47
Then you got a chance to Madison Square Garden and other places.
1:49:51
Many of the kids in my neighborhood who went to the gym ended up
1:49:57
being champions or in the top 5.
1:50:02
They worked hard, training hard, in their profession.
1:50:07
My
1:50:10
coach, Willie Reddish and Yancey Durham, they ended up being Joe
1:50:16
Frazier’s coach and manager.
1:50:20
He would tell us about preparing for a fight, that you have
1:50:26
to be a thinking fighter.
1:50:28
So, you have to study your opponent and understand that.
1:50:39
I’ll tell you one thing, he’d say, all I do is now, why do
1:50:42
you think we have shadowboxing?
1:50:46
He’d say, we want you to do that.
1:50:48
Well, I’m not boxing anybody?
1:50:50
No.
1:50:51
We want you to shadowbox for 2 minutes, shadowbox for 2 minutes.
1:50:56
Well, all of a sudden when you get in a fight, if you didn’t prepare yourself for
1:51:01
that jab, all of a sudden that jab would come down in the 3rd or 4th round and
1:51:06
then you’d get popped and knocked out.
1:51:09
I understood preparation.
1:51:12
When I ran relays or ran the 100 yard dash, the coach, everybody
1:51:22
on the track team had to run cross country, two and a half miles.
1:51:26
You had to run cross country.
1:51:28
Said, wait a minute, coach, I’m running the hurdles.
1:51:30
I’m running the 100.
1:51:31
Why do I have to run cross country?
1:51:33
Say, it’ll come to you.
1:51:35
All of a sudden, you see on the mile race the last 100 yards
1:51:42
that’s when the race starts, the last 100 yards of a mile or less.
1:51:47
I’ve seen guys who lead the race all the way around and somebody,
1:51:52
well call it draft, you run right behind them and they pass them.
1:51:56
I’d say, well, I’m running 100.
1:51:58
They’d say, well, you’ll see.
1:52:00
We’ve seen, we had a big race called the pen relays.
1:52:04
Schools from all over the country, they’d get in 100 relays and running
1:52:10
the quarter mile, the half mile.
1:52:12
No longer is quarter mile race more or less jogging race.
1:52:19
It’s a sprint.
1:52:19
The
1:52:22
mile, kid in Philadelphia broke the 4-minute mile.
1:52:31
They were running sub 4-minute miles out of Villanova.
1:52:34
Say, well, that’s practice.
1:52:37
You run each quarter.
1:52:40
We just had a guy get, I forget what country he’s from, ran a marathon and
1:52:46
ran a 4-minute mile on the marathon.
1:52:51
But it’s all conditioning.
1:52:53
It’s all conditioning.
1:52:55
So, when I scrimmaged for the local semi-pro team,
1:53:03
if I got banged up in football, you play football
1:53:09
that Monday morning, that Monday.
1:53:11
All your muscles on your body hurt.
1:53:14
I mean, even your feet hurt [laughs] . So, if I got banged up
1:53:18
because I was a running back or a defensive back, I’d sit on the bench.
1:53:23
The coach would say, Boyer you ready to practice?
1:53:25
Nope.
1:53:25
You ready to go?
1:53:26
Nope.
1:53:26
So, all the other guys, man, let me back in.
1:53:28
Let me back in, coach.
1:53:30
The fourth quarter, I would be all tuned up.
1:53:35
I had my wind.
1:53:36
I’m ready to play.
1:53:36
That’s what we call fresh legs.
1:53:39
So, I could go in and I’d get an interception as a defensive back or I
1:53:43
would juke the offensive or defensive player for 3, 2 or 3 quarters I would
1:53:52
run into him and he would tackle me.
1:53:54
I would run into him.
1:53:55
I would get his mind set, the defensive tackle.
1:53:59
The fourth quarter, he’d get ready to tackle me and I’d spin and run around him.
1:54:05
So, I had some fresh legs.
1:54:07
But, I’d try to use athletics
1:54:15
annotation with everyday problems, and it has helped.
1:54:22
It’s not surprising that you have so many professional athletes on these talk shows
1:54:30
as analysts, because they’ve been there.
1:54:34
You sit down and listen and say, well that makes sense.
1:54:38
Say, that makes sense.
1:54:40
Then, it's nice that they carry it out in to the business world
1:54:45
or the rest of their life.
1:54:50
Athletics to me was very important and looked like every time we had to go
1:54:57
out of town and play some situation would come up and I couldn’t go.
1:55:04
Oh, I was upset [laughs] , especially when the guys went to Seattle or Eugene
1:55:10
to play or different towns, sitting around here to rest, but the Portland
1:55:16
Thunderbirds were a farm team of, I think it was the Seahawks was one of the team.
1:55:26
When, in the ‘60s you didn’t have that many professional football, you didn’t
1:55:31
what, 30 professional football teams, but this is, the farm team is where they grew.
1:55:39
They got their additional players and then they had an arena, football,
1:55:45
that’s where they got it from the farm teams and they started that.
1:55:49
But when guys, when they didn’t make it in the professionals, they went to
1:55:57
the local teams, local farm teams, and they played a couple years after that.
1:56:04
Did you know anything about Otis Davis?
1:56:05
No, I didn’t know Otis.
1:56:07
Okay.
1:56:07
I didn’t know Otis, one of the athletes I didn’t know,
1:56:12
but Bobby Moore, I knew him in the neighborhood.
1:56:19
Like I said, Bill Renfro in the neighborhood.
1:56:21
Dick Daniels in the neighborhood.
1:56:23
These guys went on to do very well.
1:56:27
Rashad.
1:56:28
That’s his name, Ahmad Rashad.
1:56:30
We called him Bobby Moore.
1:56:31
His name was Bobby Moore
1:56:36
[laughs]
1:56:36
. Did you box when you were here?
1:56:38
Well, I trained, yes, at Matt Dishman.
1:56:44
So, at that time I looked a lot younger than what I was, some of the older
1:56:50
guys they thought I was in my teens.
1:56:52
I said, man, I’m 22 years old.
1:56:54
They say, oh okay.
1:56:57
Well, we know you got some skills.
1:56:58
We was talking about maybe you going pro.
1:57:00
I said, well, I’ve been that route.
1:57:02
They said, you have?
1:57:04
They said, with golden gloves?
1:57:06
Nope.
1:57:07
You didn’t fight golden gloves?
1:57:08
You didn’t go pro?
1:57:09
No.
1:57:10
We had gym wars.
1:57:14
Gym wars?
1:57:14
Yeah.
1:57:15
We had 3 gyms in north Philly, east Philly, south Philly, and west Philly.
1:57:20
They would take the best boxer in each class, that’s why a lot of the
1:57:25
boxers back east start, go pro, at 17.
1:57:30
A lot of Mexican fights go at 16.
1:57:34
What we do, they get the best weight boxer in that weight class and
1:57:39
you challenge the different gyms.
1:57:42
Now, here, Portland, Matt Dishman would challenge Mt. Scott.
1:57:49
They’d go to Mt. Scott, then they would go out to a gym in
1:57:57
north Portland or St. Johns.
1:57:59
They call that the Charles Jordan Center now.
1:58:04
That’s the different gyms.
1:58:07
Then, they had a couple professional gyms and they would send their trainers
1:58:14
down to watch the fighters, so here at Matt Dishman, we had 2 of our local
1:58:23
boxers fight in the fight off for the heavyweight championship of the world.
1:58:28
One was Thad Spencer and one was Eddie Machen.
1:58:32
They come out of Matt Dishman.
1:58:35
Thad Spencer lost to Jerry Quarry and Jerry Quarry got
1:58:39
knocked out by Joe Frazier.
1:58:41
So, these people you mentioned, were they Black or White?
1:58:45
Yeah.
1:58:46
They were African Americans, yeah I knew them.
1:58:49
We had Ray Lakin, he fought national.
1:58:52
He was a national champion.
1:58:53
Roberto Durán.
1:58:56
We had Michael Culbert fought Tommy Hearns and Marvelous Hagler.
1:59:02
We had Richard Sue.
1:59:04
I was used to boxing with all them guys.
1:59:08
We
1:59:11
got one of the fights, called two pound, he’s training now,
1:59:15
but I would give him advice.
1:59:18
Said, Mr. Boyer, man, what about coaching pro?
1:59:22
I said, no I’m working.
1:59:23
I got a job.
1:59:24
I got a family, but I would give them good advice, all these boxers.
1:59:30
They’d come back.
1:59:32
The wife and I we were in Vegas when
1:59:39
Mayweather had his fight and we were talking to some, after the
1:59:43
fight, talking to a lot of guys.
1:59:46
Hey, you know about that?
1:59:48
You know about?
1:59:49
Yeah.
1:59:49
I sure do.
1:59:53
Okay.
1:59:53
I told the guy, I said, well, if he’s not knocked down by McGregor in the
1:59:57
4th round, he’s going to win the fight.
2:00:00
Well, he fought defensive.
2:00:02
He put his hands up and took all the blows and then the
2:00:06
fourth round he started working.
2:00:10
See, that’s when you have to be a thinking fighter.
2:00:13
A lot of people think that Ali, when he fought Foreman, he had to think, because
2:00:20
he couldn’t outpunch, outhit Foreman, so he had to let Foreman outpunch himself.
2:00:29
He was tired in those later rounds, and that’s when Ali won.
2:00:34
But, that’s why I take a lot of athletic lessons and used everyday lessons
2:00:42
because there’s knowledge in that.
2:00:44
Okay?
2:00:44
Okay.
2:00:44
Any other sports questions?
2:00:45
Or anything else you want to ask?
2:00:46
[Laughs]
2:00:47
. No, I think I’m good.
2:00:48
Okay, do
2:01:00
you have any questions of us?
2:01:02
Well, I appreciate you guys and your documenting and then Greg and I was able
2:01:08
to talk about electrician and labor.
2:01:13
The thing that we talked about Washington, D.C., and the neighborhood.
2:01:20
You see, that’s how I have
2:01:25
acquired this ability to talk to folks.
2:01:28
Then you listen where folks are from or what kind of work they do, or whatever.
2:01:34
Then, you look at everybody’s life, it’s parallel.
2:01:39
You have spouses and children and grandchildren and work and living expenses
2:01:46
and homes and rentals, all kinds of stuff.
2:01:50
It’s similar.
2:01:53
We’re only 1 degree from being apart.
2:01:57
That’s family [laughs]
