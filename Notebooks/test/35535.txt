00:00
All right.
00:01
Today is February 17th, 2024.
00:04
I'm here with Aubree Kellar over zoom, and I am in Corvallis, Oregon today.
00:09
Where are you at today?
00:11
I'm also in Corvallis.
00:12
Okay.
00:12
My name is Jozie Billings, and we're doing this interview as a part of my
00:15
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:18
Welcome to the interview.
00:22
All right, so do you just want to reiterate for the interview how you
00:25
identify and what your pronouns are?
00:27
I identify largely as a trans woman.
00:30
I use she/her, for the most part.
00:33
Okay.
00:34
So
00:37
let's start at the beginning with your childhood.
00:39
Do you want to just walk me through that?
00:41
Like, what some experiences were?
00:44
What activities you were involved in?
00:46
Were there any, like, really formative experiences for your gender?
00:49
Yeah.
00:50
So, I mean, obviously.
00:51
So, you know, I was born AMAB, and my cat is in—i'm good at speaking.
00:56
And my family is pretty aggressively Catholic.
00:59
And so, so it was, it wasn't really like, an option at all
01:03
for, like, any, in any capacity.
01:05
Like I said, I wasn't I really, like, really considered until like freshman
01:10
year of high school, I started feeling like a little bit weird about it.
01:13
Like, I was like, I was like, at some point, like, confusing it for like, like,
01:18
like just like being, like, interested in girls as far as, like, you know, like
01:23
wanting to, like, be with them, but like that, after I thought about it some more,
01:27
I was kind of feeling weird about it.
01:28
But I didn’t really know, like, trans, being trans was like a thing at all
01:31
until, I started looking like more online.
01:34
And so, I graduated 2021.
01:38
And so, by about 2020, I so, you know, during the pandemic, I, you
01:44
know, everyone had a ton of time and all of a sudden, I feel like I
01:46
had this time to, like, look at this thing, and like, think about it more.
01:49
So, previously in high school, I was just doing, like, so I was doing,
01:54
FRC first robotics program, and I was doing really I was just going really
01:58
aggressively in school, and I feel like I just, like, didn't leave myself,
02:01
like, space to think about that at all.
02:03
But, you know, everything kind of went to a standstill.
02:05
And so I finally took the time to like really like think it through.
02:09
And so around, I want to say like December 2020-ish, I was identifying
02:16
as non-binary, trying to use they/them pronouns, but I didn't quite feel right.
02:21
But it felt like just like a super, just like a huge jump to jump from, like, AMAB,
02:28
identifying as male, going straight to like, trans femme.
02:32
And so I was just feeling really weird about that.
02:35
And so I just want like the in-between for a bit and then for a while, and then after
02:39
that, for a while identify with she/they.
02:41
And then I was switched more or less just to she/her for the most
02:45
part, that felt the most right.
02:47
Yeah.
02:50
I feel like that's like a very general, like, rundown.
02:52
Is that more or less helpful?
02:54
Yeah.
02:57
That that was a very broad thing.
02:58
I'm going to try and maybe, like, narrowing in on a couple things.
03:01
You're good.
03:02
It's all good information.
03:03
So did you have any, like, role models as a kid?
03:08
Especially because you say you identify as trans femme.
03:10
Did you have any, like, models of femininity that you followed in any way?
03:14
Not really, to be honest.
03:16
In
03:20
a lot of ways I feel like I'm still very much like, not like following
03:23
any like, role model that I just kind of just like figuring it out.
03:28
My mom.
03:30
Yeah.
03:30
My mom…
03:37
my mom is not someone who I would consider, like someone I would want to,
03:40
like, be a lot of, like, in some capacity.
03:42
If that makes sense.
03:46
But other than that, so I guess not really much as far as, like, role models
03:50
go, I liked a lot of, like, really like big, like, male role models, but,
03:54
it was mostly like in the big things.
03:57
Not even like gender.
03:58
Just like more like gender-, like gendered like activities.
04:02
Almost like the robotics I mentioned.
04:03
I was like, working a lot of, like, cars and stuff, which, like I still
04:07
do to a large part, a lot of like, male gendered-like-activities almost.
04:11
And so, I think that like, was like the basis of, like who I thought it was.
04:15
And you, I still kind of am.
04:18
Can you talk more about those role models you said you had?
04:22
I mean, mostly just like my dad.
04:25
I would say that I'm definitely closer with my dad and also like, like, like
04:29
mentors that, like, robotics is like a huge thing for like four years.
04:32
So forgive me, I’ll bring it up a lot apparently.
04:36
So there is my dad and there was, like the mages of robotics.
04:40
who taught me like machining and stuff like that.
04:42
So, for a really long time I really wanted to do, like machining.
04:44
I still kind of do.
04:46
So that's like milling down like pieces of metal.
04:48
Yeah.
04:52
So I guess, I don't know.
04:54
I feel like mentorship isn't like a huge part of–or sorry
04:59
not mentorship–role models where it's like a huge part of, like.
05:02
What I was aspiring to or like what I was like looking for, if that makes sense.
05:06
Yeah.
05:12
Okay.
05:15
You keep on talking about robotics, which is great.
05:17
So I'm going to get into that a little bit more.
05:19
You mentioned that you're like, kind of drawn to more like, masculine activities.
05:24
And yet you identify more of a feminine way.
05:26
Is that, do you feel any, like, disconnect between those at all, or are you just,
05:31
like, happy doing what you're doing?
05:33
I think I felt a ton of disconnect around that at first.
05:38
Where just all my friends were, male and everything I did was very
05:44
like traditional male activities.
05:45
Like, I don't do anything like, I, you know, I'm not.
05:48
I like I still am, like, super like, not that good, like, with
05:51
make up or anything like that.
05:53
And like, you know, I was, I was pulling up my hair with the zip
05:57
tie, which you shouldn't do, but I still kind of do it sometimes.
06:00
Where like, it it felt like it was.
06:02
I felt like, really weird about it at first, but it's also at the same time.
06:04
Like what?
06:05
Like I it's what I really like, enjoy.
06:07
And I feel like I found a community more so now that is also some of
06:11
the things that isn't like a super like traditionally male community.
06:14
And so I feel, I feel fine about it now.
06:16
It's just like it's just like what I'm interested in what I do.
06:19
But I mean, it still feels somewhat just because like all
06:22
like my friends and stuff are,
06:27
this point, are, the vast, vast majority of my friends are trans,
06:29
so I don't really feel like I have that many, like, cis-female friends.
06:32
So I feel like I still feel like a bit of, like disconnect from there, but I don't
06:35
think that really matters at this point.
06:37
Anyway.
06:39
I feel I'm pretty comfortable with where I am now.
06:41
Why do you not feel like that matters?
06:44
Oh, I mean, it matters, but it's, I mean, my priority isn't fitting in
06:49
with the traditional female, like
06:54
mass or whatever.
06:55
That's not the correct word, but, I feel like my priority is just
06:59
trying to like my own slice and like what feels most comfortable.
07:03
And I don't particularly care if that–trans femme is what I would
07:08
call it in the vast, vast, vast majority of people were like, no,
07:11
this is like the super easy solution.
07:13
But I don't know if I strictly identify with that in the closest ways possible.
07:18
Definitely
07:20
trans-femme leaning.
07:21
But I still don’t feel like I don’t like totally there, if that makes sense.
07:26
Yeah.
07:26
No.
07:27
That does.
07:27
And I get what you're saying about not identifying with like mainstream
07:31
like cis-het femininity and stuff.
07:34
I feel like that makes a lot of sense.
07:35
So
07:42
can you, I know you mentioned it before, but can you talk a little bit more about
07:46
what your gender exploration process was
07:54
like?
07:55
It was.
07:55
It felt
08:01
very secretive for a really long time for issues like, Catholic
08:05
household, my household still, my siblings are, my parents are still
08:09
by no means accepting or anything.
08:12
And so it just felt like really like it almost felt like any, like any sort
08:17
of exploration I did was almost like, like I had to be completely hidden.
08:20
I couldn't do anything past that.
08:23
And so it was,
08:27
you know, like trying to, like, do, like make up or like trying out
08:31
things like in, like my car at, like the Benton County Fairgrounds or
08:35
something, like, go away from home.
08:37
And I was also spending like a ton of time in my car so I could, like, try and
08:43
have just like a third space almost the way such like for like experimentation.
08:46
So, like I owned–so my first car is my $500 Volkswagen Passat,
08:51
that I fought hornets out of it.
08:54
So I was kind of.
08:55
And so I was doing DoorDash with that, and I was doing probably like
09:00
10 to 12 hours a day in that car, because if I was out DoorDashing,
09:04
then I wasn't at home and like trying to, like, deal with all of that.
09:08
And so I was so that I loved that car for a really long time.
09:13
And then it's, it doesn't really matter, but it, it broke down, and
09:17
then my parents made me sell it before I left for Montana State.
09:21
Because I, I transferred up from up from there to OSU.
09:25
Which is silly because I lived in Corvallis, I transferred to
09:28
Montana, then came back to Corvallis.
09:29
Yeah.
09:32
Sorry.
09:32
Get getting back on topic.
09:33
So it's a lot of like, trying to find, like, third spaces or like,
09:36
carving, trying to, like, carve out places to, like, try and, like, see,
09:38
experiment that wasn't home or if it was home, like, super like balled up my.
09:44
Or like, in, like the locked bathroom and like, like hiding like a skirt.
09:47
Like under my shirt before.
09:48
Like making, like the run to the bathroom to try it on, if that makes sense.
09:55
And so once I left for Montana, I spent so much money on, like, femme
10:01
clothes and like, like because, like, even, like when I was out to my
10:05
because, like, I was out to my parents.
10:06
I was still getting, like, male clothes from them.
10:08
And I just like, what the fuck am I going to do with these?
10:10
Sorry, I don’t know if I can swear [Jozie: No, you’re good, you can swear.] And
10:14
so I just so I still have like, this, like, massive bin of, like, brand new,
10:17
like, male clothes from my parents.
10:19
And, like, I don't know what to do with these.
10:22
And so it's.
10:23
And so I spent a ton of my own money on a bunch of, like, femme
10:26
clothes and then and so Montana.
10:28
So once I was in Montana, I feel like I really like, found,
10:30
like my, aesthetic almost.
10:33
If that makes sense or like feeling what feels like more comfortable.
10:36
Like, before I left for Montana, I had like one outfit that I felt good about
10:39
and I just kind of like iterated on that almost from there and just like,
10:43
build up to something that I felt like that felt like more like personal
10:46
or like more like what felt good.
10:50
And it feels like since that it's just like iterating on that.
10:54
Does that make sense?
10:55
Yeah, no.
10:57
So, you mentioned you found outfits that felt good to you.
11:01
Can you talk more about, like, what is euphoric to you in terms of your gender
11:04
and, maybe, what it's also dysphoric.
11:08
So I wear skirts.
11:10
The only time I'm not wearing a skirt at this point is like I'm sleeping.
11:14
And so that's, like, a big thing for me.
11:16
And, like, I've kind of fallen, like, almost like, accidentally into,
11:19
like, a more like, goth aesthetic.
11:21
And so it's really interesting because, like, I'm not sure if it's that.
11:23
If it's like, if I like, I definitely like, like the look of that and
11:26
everything, but I it's, it's plays in with like my weight almost where
11:29
it feels like I don't know if like I'm like it was like try to like
11:32
obfuscate that if that makes sense.
11:33
Trying to make that less visible.
11:35
So I’m trying to lose weight.
11:36
So curious to see how that how I work with that.
11:38
But for the time being it's like a pretty like, goth alternative, even
11:43
though, like, I don't like, identify with any of those labels, but that's
11:45
definitely what people would call.
11:47
And then when I look up when I'm looking for clothes.
11:51
Because like, I don't consider myself as part of in those communities or anything.
11:55
I don't listen to, like, goth music or anything.
11:57
I just like, I think it looks pretty decent on me, which is the, which is nice.
12:02
So yeah.
12:04
And then so yeah, I wear a lot of skirts and dresses.
12:08
I have a big problem with jeans as far as dysphoria goes.
12:10
I don't like how they look.
12:11
The, for this is.
12:15
This is.
12:15
Yeah.
12:16
I just don't like how they look.
12:17
I feel like I just like they just, like, don't work for me or like myself.
12:24
Yeah.
12:24
Dysphoric, you know, trying to trying to get away from that for so long now.
12:28
Dysphoria,
12:32
for a long part was
12:35
just like, like the, really really early transition before, like, I found, like an
12:40
aesthetic or, like, what I thought looked good or like what I thought works for me.
12:43
I feel like that's like most, like, aggressive, like dysphoric period ever.
12:47
Just like all this, like, weird iterating.
12:49
And it just all feels terrible and like, it makes me like it almost makes me want
12:53
to go back to like, AMAB-ness or like that felt like, it's still sucked, but like it
12:58
felt like I wasn't iterating on something.
13:00
It wasn't like getting worse if that makes sense.
13:02
There's like this, like, I, I feel like it's like a meme now, like
13:05
really, really transition for everyone.
13:07
It's just like.
13:08
Or at least this has been my experience with all my friends
13:10
is just, like, kind of terrible.
13:12
And it just felt terrible for me.
13:14
And I feel like that was like the most, like, aggressive dysphoria I had
13:17
especially for like, HRT or anything.
13:18
And I think I started working before I really know what I was doing, I was
13:21
just like, I was just like stuffing, like skirts down my pants and then
13:25
going out DoorDashing and just like.
13:27
And so, like, you take off the pants, this way you can have a skirt on, but it's
13:30
just like, it's just like, you know, it felt terrible, you know, it felt like I
13:34
needed to, like, figure this stuff out.
13:35
At the same time, I didn't feel like there's a light at the
13:37
end of the tunnel or anything.
13:38
It just felt like really, like, there was like going back towards
13:43
AMAB was bad, going forward felt bad at the time and I just felt
13:48
like I was really stuck during that.
13:49
And that also was like the context of like feeling of like, you know,
13:54
true like, you know, we're still in a pandemic, true, like really aggressive.
13:58
No one really knew anything yet kind of thing.
14:01
And I was and so like, it's just like overall suck really bad, I guess.
14:07
Yeah.
14:08
Oh, that doesn't sound great.
14:10
I have a friend who also kind of struggled with that, like, accepting the, like,
14:15
transition to femininity is, like, the best thing for them, even though
14:19
it felt, like, really hard in a way.
14:23
But you, you spoke about it in the past tense, do you think
14:25
you're, like, past that now?
14:27
For the most part.
14:30
I feel like I am in the most part past that, but I am past, I’m like in this
14:36
comfortable pocket where like, I'm happy with where this is for, like, iterating
14:41
past that pocket still doesn't feel great, if that makes sense, almost.
14:45
Where like I'm very comfortable with what I wear now, you know, I repeat
14:48
the same ten outfits, you know, for the last like two years straight or
14:52
whatever and iterating past that.
14:54
it's either it goes well or it goes, it's, you know, something.
14:57
I mean, you know, occasionally there’s a win, that’s the whole
14:59
point of iterating, right?
15:00
But like, between all of those wins you lose, I have, there's a lot of
15:05
things that just don't quite work, or just like things like I bought or
15:08
tried and like I won't wear or like changes of like how I thought I would
15:12
identify, like they didn't work out.
15:14
So going back to this like pocket if that makes sense.
15:17
Yeah.
15:17
I feel like that makes sense.
15:28
So, you mentioned your family was Catholic.
15:31
You don't have to get into that more if you don't want to.
15:32
But were there any other significant influences on your gender like that could
15:37
be your religion, but maybe like a job you had, like where you were raised?
15:41
Anything like that.
15:42
So like, so can you, can you?
15:45
So what else could influence my gender?
15:48
Like where I was raised, like religion or anything.
15:51
Yeah.
15:51
Just like any other major influences on your gender.
15:58
I feel like a lot of, like, influence was.
16:04
I don't know, in person influences were like, I know, like I already
16:07
mentioned, like you've seen like cis-women or like even like other
16:10
trans women at my high school.
16:11
If that makes sense where it felt like I want it to be that
16:14
but didn’t really explore it.
16:16
I didn't really know what that meant or anything at the time.
16:18
And then all the other pressure was aggressively male.
16:25
I mean, I still [indistinguishable] with my parents very much so have—or
16:29
had, at most point still have an aggressive like, you're male, you're
16:32
going to go to engineering school, you're going to go graduate and you're
16:34
going to a male job or whatever.
16:36
And so, I feel like there's a lot of pressure from that.
16:38
And then obviously being Catholic, or at least my church, [“] my
16:42
church [“] feels weird.
16:43
I haven’t been there in like three years.
16:44
But the church that definitely my parents went to, that wasn’t.
16:47
That wasn’t an option at all, transitioning or
16:50
anything, thinking about that.
16:51
And so between so the only like really in-person thing I would have to say was
16:55
just like seeing other women or like are like my like, my female friends, so
17:00
I guess like the vast majority—And this also ties back, sorry, I'm going to bring
17:04
this up because apparently, like, I guess it makes sense as I was transitioning
17:07
like during like peak pandemic period, but, you know, a lot of it felt like it
17:10
was online influences because, partially because, because like, partially
17:16
everyone was super online at the time.
17:18
Yeah, do want to talk more about that, what influence online space has had?
17:23
Yeah.
17:26
So,
17:29
at the most part, it's looking at trans spaces on, like, Reddit
17:34
and stuff, which is terrible.
17:36
Reddit is terrible.
17:37
It's all terrible.
17:38
And so, from there I started looking at like, trans discord
17:40
services, which is also terrible.
17:40
I strongly believe that a purely like trans discord server is
17:45
like the worst place you can be on discord, because it's just like
17:50
everyone—okay, maybe, maybe it's again, maybe this like peak pandemic, but
17:54
like, everyone is just, like miserable and like, there's no one that can help
17:58
each other because we're all like a thousand miles away from each other.
18:00
There's no advantage there.
18:02
But, you know, I didn't know that at the time.
18:04
And so, I felt like, a lot of, like, my first, like, trans, like, looking
18:09
at this stuff was like, oh, I guess miserable because it was like all of
18:14
these people who were super dysphoric and, like, everyone was just, like, stuck.
18:17
And no one could really, like, help each other there, cause its a bunch
18:20
of teenagers on a discord server.
18:23
And it's like, oh, what are we going to do?
18:25
And so, in some it, you know, it was definitely good to like, get like
18:28
that community and be able to talk through what I was thinking at the
18:33
time, but at the same time in, like.
18:36
I almost wish that like the start off, to any sort of like
18:39
transition would be more joyful.
18:41
Is that make sense?
18:41
But I don't think I mean, like, I don't know that many people.
18:44
I don't know if anyone's fun, like, had a joyful start.
18:46
I feel like it almost really starts in a really dark place, which makes
18:50
a lot of these spaces I think feel very negative for the most part.
18:57
And so, from there, I feel like that public discord server,
18:59
which is always terrible.
19:02
My twin, he was friends with a bunch of people in, like, a summer camp, which
19:08
isn't like a queer summer camp, but it definitely was like a lot of queers
19:13
in a summer camp, if that makes sense.
19:16
And so, Eric reached out to them because he was, like, the only person
19:20
I knew who would who was aware of, like, gender queer people or like, for
19:25
the most part, even like gay people.
19:28
So, he reached out to them and that discord – apparently my entire life
19:32
is on discord – so he reached out on that on this discord server.
19:35
There, I was I kind of made friends with, like, those people.
19:39
And I talk with them in a lot more constructive, a lot more
19:43
just like people like friends is suppose like a public space.
19:46
A lot more like it feels wrong, but like a lot more like close, close period work.
19:52
I also like, talk through a lot of things and like get help from there.
19:55
And so, and we're still very much so like just like a bunch of
19:58
teenagers who can’t help each other.
19:59
But it felt less like just a bunch of just like people just like all be miserable
20:03
in the same place and felt like an actual friend group, if that makes sense.
20:07
Yeah,
20:09
no, that does make sense.
20:12
So you mentioned that the beginning of your transition or for many
20:16
transitions wasn’t very joyful.
20:18
Do you think you've been able to find examples of joy or even
20:21
create your own since then?
20:23
Oh, absolutely.
20:27
Just like seeing myself in a mirror for the most part, still feels
20:31
joyful now, if that makes sense.
20:35
For the most part, it's still like, just seeing myself feels
20:38
like, oh, this feels more right.
20:39
This feels more accurate.
20:41
Like I feel like I am a much more like confident person.
20:44
I'm much more able to, like, interact with the world, for where I am now.
20:50
And like, you know, I've seen them, like a lot of my friends too, were
20:57
just like not doing good for the most part, until people began transitioning.
21:02
Like you can see, HRT take effect.
21:03
You actually can see a lot of people, just like all of a sudden
21:06
like that, they turn back on.
21:07
If that makes sense.
21:08
With this really dark period quickly you can see reaching back out and
21:12
like being close, like more functional to how you knew them before.
21:16
Like this, before these really like hit them, if that makes sense.
21:20
Especially cause, like, a lot of my trans friends were all cis in high
21:24
school or like, kind of went through like a similar, like, timing, if
21:27
that makes sense, at where I did.
21:31
Yeah, well, that makes sense.
21:35
Did you like help anyone else through their transition?
21:41
I'm definitely giving advice to some friends about like HRT and
21:46
stuff, like in my in-person friends.
21:50
I think I was the first one to go on HRT.
21:53
That sounded really certain, I know.
21:55
Let me think about it.
21:56
I think I was the first person to go on HRT in any of my in-person
22:00
friends, which, you know, was only really helpful for trans femmes.
22:04
You know, I can give really hot takes about trans masc, that's not that helpful.
22:08
So to my trans femme friends, I feel like I was helpful.
22:12
Or I feel like I was able to help with, like, initial how it, like, cause, like,
22:17
were going back, it feels terrible.
22:20
Because, like, there's like this, like just like sea of feeling
22:23
like complete shit before your hormones really ever switch female.
22:28
Where there’s this gully almost where its like extremely mood swingy,
22:31
extremely like, it just feels terrible.
22:35
And so, like, be like, talk through people with that and
22:42
refer friends to, uh… I first got my HRT through Planned Parenthood
22:46
because I was eighteen and then I switched to the Corvallis Clinic.
22:49
That doesn’t really matter.
22:50
But I was able to refer my friends to go and be able to go through Planned
22:54
Parenthood, which is super helpful.
22:59
Okay.
22:59
This is kind of not really a follow up question, but a different one.
23:03
When have you felt most at home in your body?
23:09
I mean, I would say I just feel more at home in my body, like every day, like
23:15
after transitioning, like I, I previously this is, I previously like I would always
23:22
say to like the therapist I had at the time, who was a Catholic therapist.
23:25
It was bad, but that wasn’t really her fault.
23:27
There's a whole different lore jump there, but I don’t think that’s super irrelevant.
23:31
Don't let your parents pick your therapist.
23:32
Okay.
23:33
So either way, I would to say to her is that, like I, when I see myself in the
23:38
mirror, I don't think I can pick myself out of a line up, if that makes sense.
23:41
And I feel like now I can, I feel like I can definitely now
23:44
pick myself out of a lineup.
23:46
And I feel like it feels like my body now, if that makes sense.
23:49
Like, I feel like I'm just, like, more aware of what I am and like, who I am now.
23:55
And like for like the most part.
23:58
I was.
23:59
Yeah.
24:00
So I guess I feel more at home in my body.
24:05
being able– even when I'm not, like, dressed up or anything, but I can still,
24:09
like, see myself in, like, a window or like, see myself in like a mirror.
24:12
And it still feels like myself as opposed to like this, like other person
24:16
I was kind of ignoring and almost like piloting, if that makes sense.
24:21
Yeah.
24:22
That does.
24:22
So,
24:37
you talked about online space has being pretty terrible for you.
24:40
And also that you went to Montana State, but then you transferred back to OSU.
24:44
So how is your time been at OSU?
24:47
Like being able to, like, be in-person and stuff like that.
24:51
Being in-person at OSU, I think is really great.
24:54
In general, online schooling I don't think works that well for me personally.
25:02
And so being able to like be in person and like for the most part, like
25:04
I don't feel like unsafe or like I don't think I've ever felt like any
25:08
like, you know, like problems and OSU.
25:09
Now granted, I transferred to OSU when I at least I think I passed pretty good.
25:13
And like I, and so, I never had that much of an opportunity of that big of a
25:19
target on my back, if that makes sense.
25:20
I feel like I blend in, for the most part, pretty good.
25:23
So, I can't really speak to what it would be like to someone who's
25:26
super aggressively, like, not fitting in, if that makes sense.
25:29
But for the most part, I feel like everyone is really good as far
25:32
as like being trans and in-person schooling I think is working a
25:37
lot better for me personally.
25:40
The one thing that OSU, I feel like I feel like OSU might just be like a
25:43
hair too big, almost where like, at Montana State I felt like it was a lot
25:47
more like a like a personal connection with, like, teachers and stuff and
25:52
professors, but I this also could be me.
25:55
I arguably have not been much of an effort in that regard since
25:58
transferring here because it—so this very well could be like a my issue.
26:04
But like with a lot of the engineering classes, it felt like it feels like even
26:07
when you go for like help, there seems just like a thousand TAs all in like a
26:10
panic or like a wormhole or anything.
26:12
It feels like there's, like, not that much time for, like, one on one help
26:15
here, which I'm kind of struggling with.
26:17
But again, this could be a me problem.
26:21
So, what's your major here?
26:23
Mechanical engineering.
26:24
Mechanical engineering.
26:27
You said before that your parents were like, you're going
26:30
to go to engineering school.
26:31
Did you, are you like still, did you choose engineering for yourself?
26:37
Uhhh,
26:40
hard to say.
26:41
Hard to say.
26:42
Are you happy in it?
26:44
Definitely when I first went into college it was not my choice.
26:49
For the most part, I still feel like I just want to build shit.
26:53
Like, I just want to, like, yeah.
26:57
I think I, if in a perfect world where I made every single choice,
27:03
I feel like I still would have went into a very similar field.
27:06
I don't know if it would have been engineering exactly, but I
27:09
still feel like it's close enough.
27:10
I am genuinely, for the most part, happy in it.
27:15
Now I do kind of, I don’t know, Eric – Eric, I think I mentioned, is my twin
27:20
– he fought my parents to listen like he's going to architecture school now.
27:24
And, you know, he does seem happier, to be honest.
27:26
But, like, I think it'll be fine either way.
27:33
If you could do a different major, what do you think you'd pick?
27:36
I don't know.
27:41
That's fair.
27:42
You don’t have to
27:46
know.
27:49
Well, I’m going to ask you about your objects now, what did you bring today?
27:53
I brought my sourdough starter.
27:54
Amazing.
27:55
And what made you pick this object?
27:58
Because I just I thought, like, we talked earlier about iterating and I
28:02
feel like a sourdough starter was a really good way of symbolizing that.
28:07
Or like, almost like the symbol of how a transition starts.
28:11
Like this thing starts as, like a really smelly.
28:15
It proofs as a pure hootch, it makes you go blind if you, when you first do it.
28:19
And if you ignore it like it's, it's one of my favorite activities
28:24
is to not feed it for a little bit then force my roommates to smell
28:26
it, like it like burns your nose.
28:28
It's great, either way.
28:29
So, I just thought a lot about the iterating and, like, the starting
28:32
out thing where, like, it's this is like something that you actually
28:35
have to continually work at.
28:37
But if you, when you do that, like, you get really cool results, it's like, you
28:40
know, I make pretty good bread, I think.
28:43
But like if it's like ignored or if it's like, not like cared about or anything,
28:48
it just it gets smelly, it produces that blinding hootch, and it dies.
28:54
This one might be dead, but that's not really, we're not going to
28:57
worry about that for the metaphor.
28:59
This one might be dead because my kitchen flooded and theres a dehumidifer in my
29:03
house, which has ruined the microbiome of my house, but that’s doesn’t really
29:09
matter, we’re not going to worry about that for the metaphor.
29:10
What was I going to say?
29:10
So I just thought that was really good way of like showing, like the
29:14
iteration where it's like it gets better and better the more you work on it.
29:19
And so, I thought that was.
29:20
So, in the same way, it's just like something you work at,
29:25
continuously, just like, kind of like gender where it feels like.
29:30
Or at least I don't know if I feel like I feel like working on gender
29:32
continuously, but I feel like I have to work on it… like effort has to be put into
29:37
it, otherwise it doesn't quite work as well, if that makes sense, I don't know.
29:42
This metaphor may have worked out better in my head.
29:44
It worked out really good in my head.
29:45
I think it makes sense.
29:46
Do you think that most people don't have to work at their gender?
29:51
I would say that anyone who’s cis doesn't work at their gender,
29:55
but that's like that's like leaving, you know, like the bread.
29:58
Because sourdough starter is just flour and water.
30:00
I would argue that's like leaving the two of them as completely separate things.
30:05
As opposed to, I feel like once people, I don't know if there's any,
30:10
I guess I'm making broad statements.
30:11
It feels like, for the most part, all like the trans people I know.
30:14
It's not something that, like, ever is, like, particularly,
30:17
like at rest of that makes sense.
30:19
Where it feels like gender feels like it's something that can be like, iterated,
30:22
like feels like there's always, like more exploration that could happen.
30:26
That doesn't mean you have to like, have to, but it feels like
30:31
there's something more that could always, like, happen.
30:32
If that makes sense.
30:35
No, no, I like that metaphor, I think it's a good one.
30:39
Do
30:45
you think you always would have picked sourdough to represent you?
30:49
Or like, what do you think you would have picked five years ago?
30:52
Five years ago.
30:55
That was what, 2019 I was junior year of high school.
31:00
Sorry.
31:00
I'm just trying to get myself a time frame for when that was.
31:06
Junior year of high school, I feel like it was like like a lot of, like – you
31:09
said I need to pick a thing to represent myself – junior year of high school.
31:18
Sorry, I came prepared with a metaphor for today, I didn’t come
31:20
with a metaphor for five years ago.
31:21
And you don't have to have one if you don't have one, it’s okay.
31:24
I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but I'll keep thinking about it.
31:26
But junior me of high school, sorry, junior year of high school felt
31:30
like a whole lot of like beginnings.
31:33
Like I feel like I didn't particularly know anything about myself until
31:38
that year where I feel like I really started open up, if that makes sense.
31:41
It is
31:44
also hard because I feel like I don't have that many like
31:46
memories from pre-transition.
31:49
Which doesn't super help.
31:53
Yeah.
31:53
I just feel like that year was like a whole lot of beginnings.
31:55
And I feel like, it was those beginnings and, like, trying to, just feel like
32:00
as a whole, just, like, trying to, like, figure myself out that year.
32:05
Yep, that makes sense.
32:07
So, your object would be different.
32:10
You just don't really know what it is, basically.
32:12
Yeah, yeah.
32:13
Okay.
32:15
All right.
32:15
Well, that's all the questions I have.
32:16
Is there anything else that you feel like you didn't cover that you want
32:18
to talk about or just mention briefly?
32:22
I don't think so.
32:23
I’m going to put this elsewhere now because I’m playing with it.
32:28
Oh, I have a thousand cups, that are stacked on my desk, they all fell over.
32:30
Okay.
32:31
Nothing off
32:34
the top of my head.
32:35
No.
34:52
Yeah.
34:52
Okay, cool.
34:55
Thank you so much for doing this interview.
34:58
Yeah.
34:59
Of course.
