00:02
Okay.
00:04
Today is March 10th, 2024.
00:06
I'm here with Lilith.
00:08
Lilith Wikstein?
00:10
Wiksten?
00:10
Yeah.
00:12
Wiksten.
00:12
Over Zoom.
00:12
And we are both- well, I'm in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:14
Where are you at today?
00:16
Yep, Corvallis.
00:17
Corvallis, cool.
00:18
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as a part of my
00:21
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:24
Welcome to the interview.
00:25
Thank you for coming.
00:26
All right, so just, start with the basics.
00:30
Can you reiterate for the interview how you identify what your pronouns are?
00:33
I
00:36
Identify with she/her.
00:38
I don't know if that's proper, proper grammar, I don't know.
00:43
But, yeah, I consider myself a girl.
00:45
She/her.
00:46
Okay.
00:49
So do you want to start?
00:51
Let's start it.
00:51
Okay.
00:51
Let's start at the beginning.
00:53
Can you talk to me a bit about your childhood, maybe, like, some of
00:58
the activities you're involved in, any, like, formative experiences
01:01
you remember for your gender?
01:03
Anything like that?
01:04
Oh, yeah.
01:05
I mean, when I was younger, I. Well, I presume, and I'm
01:10
totally fine with it, but, like.
01:12
I assume you're okay with me going, kind of, like, deep and dark, you know, like.
01:17
Whatever you're comfortable with, I think.
01:19
Okay.
01:19
Just making sure I don't want to, like, catch you off guard or anything.
01:23
But.
01:24
Yeah.
01:24
So when I was a little kid I was pretty feminine, you know, I liked a lot of
01:32
girly things and that sort of stuff.
01:34
But my father, well, actually, it was my step grandfather, but that's like
01:40
a weird, complicated, you know, term.
01:43
So we'll just say father, you know, because he was,
01:46
for all intents and purposes.
01:49
I mean, he, like, was very abusive.
01:51
And he'd hit me and stuff.
01:53
He'd call me, like, the f-slur and that sort of thing.
01:56
Really despised the idea of me being feminine in anyway, so that was, you
02:02
know, an existential terror for me.
02:04
It really was.
02:05
There's no other way to put it.
02:07
And growing up, I started to repress my femininity, as you could probably guess.
02:13
You know, even when they got divorced by the time I was, like,
02:18
ten-ish, he was completely out of my life, you know, for the most part.
02:24
And I lived with my grandmother.
02:26
Well, Mom, I'll just call her Mom, out in the middle of nowhere.
02:31
Moved the country in north Idaho, actually.
02:34
Yeah.
02:35
And, it was nice for a while, but that still lasted with me.
02:41
So, I kept suppressing my femininity.
02:44
And as puberty started to roll around, I was sort of horrified with, you
02:48
know, the changes I was going through.
02:50
But at the same time, I, I was really hoping that, like, eventually,
02:56
eventually, I would enjoy it.
02:58
Eventually I'd like it.
03:00
The problem isn't that I'm feminine.
03:01
The problem is that I'm not masculine enough, and once I get to that point,
03:06
I'm going to be happy, you know?
03:08
And that was not, that was not true.
03:11
But I actually, ironically, I really wanted to grow a beard.
03:16
I really wanted to get a deeper voice.
03:19
You know, I really wanted all these things because I just thought, like,
03:22
once I got there, I would feel happy.
03:25
And I was trying to be a, like, tough, masculine guy, but, you know, I was
03:30
called, like, in middle of nowhere, like redneck North Idaho, like, again, like I
03:35
was, call it like the f-slur and stuff, you know, I was just like, this is really,
03:38
really rough when I was younger, like elementary school and then, like, it was
03:44
really, really bad in elementary school.
03:47
Middle school, I actually went to one school, and then I had to
03:50
leave because I got bullied so bad.
03:53
And someone like, even, like, knocked me out.
03:57
I like, they like bashed my head up against a wall.
04:00
Yeah no, that wasn't a very good place, for, for queer folks.
04:05
Yeah.
04:07
And then, yeah, middle school.
04:11
I sort of started to retreat into myself a bit, and I wasn't really an
04:15
outcast for most of middle school.
04:17
Once I moved to this new school, I was just more of, like, an outsider,
04:23
you know, it was more by choice.
04:24
But I got, like, tough.
04:27
And then.
04:29
Here.
04:29
You're going to this, I always like, this is a fun party trick.
04:34
This is my, like, biological or, well, I know, yeah, this is how I sound.
04:42
The like before I've done any, like, voice training or anything.
04:45
It actually sounds kind of weird because I haven't talked this way in a while.
04:49
But I have a really deep voice, you know?
04:52
And anyway, my voice dropped.
04:54
Right.
04:55
And with that.
04:57
And with me, like, developing this sort of, like, tough
04:59
guy, like outsider persona.
05:03
By high school, I had become very tough, and I had become like, you
05:08
know, dark and edgy and shit, you know, and I thought I was like, cool.
05:13
Or, you know, well, I wouldn't say I thought I was.
05:17
I just wanted to.
05:18
Give the illusion.
05:19
And I started to play that character very well, to the point where people
05:23
were becoming intimidated by me.
05:26
And there was a short period there, like freshman year, because I had been
05:29
so used to defending my self against bullies that I, like, overcorrected, and
05:34
I was a bully for a tiny bit, you know?
05:37
But, yeah, I always had lots and lots of female friends, you
05:43
know, they were all girls, right?
05:46
But, I always, like, told myself I was like, no, I don't
05:51
need to, like, it's okay.
05:53
Like, I'm not gay or anything, you know?
05:56
You know, I'm definitely a guy, for sure.
06:00
Guy... Yeah, and it was, yeah, it was just it was very goofy.
06:04
And I remember doing, like, things, and I did this for quite a while where, like,
06:10
I would feel the need to hit on them.
06:11
You know, I wouldn't need to, like, be, accepted.
06:17
Right?
06:17
That wasn't the point.
06:18
I just had to do it so I could, like, prove that I was a dude, right.
06:24
And yeah, like, all my, but like, 99% of all my friends were girls, right?
06:30
But eventually people started to think that they were like "Oh, he just does
06:35
get all the chicks, man," you know?
06:38
Because I'm always, like, hanging out with these girls.
06:40
And, I sort of like, I let people sort of think that.
06:45
But then, yeah, I got, like,
06:49
popular-y by the end of high school.
06:52
At least among, like, certain circles, right?
06:55
And just in general, everybody thought of me as this, like, extremely like tough,
07:00
like masculine, like hyper-masculine dude.
07:04
And at that point, I was having, you know, like, while I was having, like,
07:11
lots of sex with, like, girls and stuff, or at least like, dating them.
07:16
And then I just, you know, do it a few times, that kind of thing.
07:20
Just to, like, prove that I was like, yes, I, I enjoy this.
07:23
I want to do this.
07:24
I'm a red-blooded American male, you know?
07:27
But then, like my freshman year, when I came here last year at OSU,
07:33
like, well like the end of senior year, I'd say throughout that summer.
07:39
And then the beginning of freshman year, I was playing this character
07:42
and been playing this character so well for so long that, like,
07:48
I realized I still wasn't happy.
07:51
And like, even though everybody thinks that I am this person that
07:56
I've been trying to be for so long.
08:00
I've made it right, but I'm not happy.
08:04
And that's when I started to sort of cave.
08:08
Especially when I met my boyfriend.
08:12
Who, he's a trans guy, and I met him here at OSU freshman year, and.
08:18
Yeah.
08:20
Yeah, I can go more in depth on anything you want.
08:22
You can ask more questions if you'd like.
08:29
I don't know.
08:30
Let me think for a second.
08:31
Okay.
08:32
Yeah.
08:33
I'm also from Idaho, but I'm from southern Idaho.
08:35
Oh, I can't say my experience was the same, but for different reasons.
08:40
Yeah.
08:46
So, I mean, you talked about wanting to fit this, like,
08:51
masculine stereotype, right?
08:55
But did you have any, like, role models, I guess.
09:00
Not like, I don't know, just in general because, like, it's not like
09:03
you really wanted to be masculine.
09:04
But if you had any like feminine role models or anything like that.
09:08
Well, I was
09:11
for the most part raised by women.
09:15
You know, after my horrible, abusive dad, you know, and I was,
09:19
like, beaten and stuff, you know?
09:21
I mean, worse than that.
09:23
After, like, he was out of my life.
09:26
I was mostly raised by women.
09:27
But my mother, parentheses grandmother.
09:32
You know, she had, she, like, met some guys.
09:38
And she's with one now, Sid Clark.
09:41
And they've been together for years, and he's a wonderful guy.
09:45
But I always rejected, like, masculine figures, you know, like, I always just,
09:50
like, never really, really took to them.
09:53
I never really took to any sort of parental, role model in general, but
09:59
like, I outright rejected masculine ones and not even in, like, a harsh way.
10:03
You know, I never once was like, "you're not my dad," you
10:06
know, like, that never happened.
10:07
Like, we both really like each other, you know?
10:11
But I don't think of him as my dad in any way.
10:13
And there was actually quite a few, like, male role model figures who tried
10:18
to be something like, you know, well, like, potential male role model figures,
10:24
who, like, tried to be that for me.
10:27
Very good ones, you know, cool, wonderful people.
10:31
But, like yeah, it's, I just never took to it.
10:38
When it comes to just sort of, like, broader role models, not necessarily
10:42
something that's, like, more parental.
10:45
No.
10:46
Just not really.
10:47
I don't really, I've never really had any.
10:49
Yeah.
10:51
No.
10:54
Well, you mentioned that your boyfriend, like, I don't know, you mentioned
10:58
meeting him was an important experience.
11:00
Can you talk about that?
11:01
Oh, yeah.
11:03
So, yeah, freshman year.
11:06
I meet him, and.
11:10
Yeah, he was just, he was really, really sweet.
11:13
He's a trans guy.
11:14
And, yeah, I remember that kind of like, that little shit, like,
11:20
messed with my head, you know?
11:22
Because at the point- at that point, I not only like, didn't, like,
11:25
admit I was a girl, I thought I was straight, you know, like, I was like.
11:29
I'm into girls.
11:30
[Laughter from Lilith's background] He's actually he's, he's,
11:32
he's, yeah, we live together.
11:35
But.
11:35
Yeah, I thought I was, I thought I was straight.
11:39
Or at least I wanted to be, you know, and, where was I?
11:45
Sorry.
11:46
We met.
11:47
Yeah.
11:49
And we started talking and stuff, and as, like, horrible as it is, sort of like what
11:54
subconsciously I told myself was, like, well, you know, like, he uses he/they
12:02
pronouns, you know, and I was like, well, he, he's like a little bit not a guy.
12:10
So like, you know, and also like, he doesn't have a, you know, down there.
12:16
So like, you know, like, I'm not, I'm not really gay or anything.
12:23
And like, again, like, as horrible as that is - and I feel bad about it - I think if
12:29
it wasn't like that precise combination, I wouldn't have allowed myself to sort
12:34
of, like, slip into this and, like, start, like trying little things.
12:37
But then eventually we start talking, and I just like, I mean, I fell,
12:41
like, head over heels for him.
12:43
I mean, I just went like crazy for him.
12:46
And, yeah.
12:48
So, I guess in terms of, like a role model, like later in
12:51
life, you know, more recently.
12:54
A role model is kind of a weird word to use for him.
12:58
But.
12:58
He has genuinely-I mean, I couldn't have transitioned without him.
13:04
He's been incredibly supportive.
13:05
He's, like, held my hand.
13:08
And also, just like the bravery of seeing, like a trans person that has, like,
13:14
overcome stuff that he has and that kind of stuff and, like, realizing it's okay
13:19
and that sort of thing is wild because I don't, I was never like consciously
13:26
homophobic or transphobic or anything.
13:29
Which, coming from where I come from is impressive in its own right.
13:34
But like, I clearly was, you know, and even now, as strange as it is, because
13:40
I'm doing the exact same thing, like, I have so much internalized transphobia
13:46
that, like walking around Corvallis or something, when I see someone that is
13:50
like a biological male, like me in a dress just for a split second, something
13:55
in the back of my head is like, whoa!
13:57
You know?
13:57
And then I'm like, look down, and I'm like, oh, you know, doing the same thing.
14:04
But yeah, it's really deeply ingrained.
14:06
And seeing how he was able to, yeah, like getting to know him and getting
14:10
to like, understand him and everything.
14:12
Was just, it was really, really cool.
14:15
And that helped me a lot.
14:16
Yeah.
14:19
And, so you mentioned how you're, like, playing this role throughout
14:23
your childhood and like, into, like, high school, but then senior year,
14:27
you kind of like, realized that.
14:28
And, so then you moved to Corvallis.
14:31
And is that when your gender exploration process kind of began?
14:35
Yeah, I would say it just.
14:39
Just a hair began, when I met him, you know, and we sort of talking and
14:45
that kind of thing and...yeah, it's.
14:49
Yeah, it's just like very, very, very slowly, you know, slipped
14:54
into it started like being okay with doing some feminine things.
14:59
And I mean, I'm talking about, like, at this point it was feminine things,
15:02
but only to what, like, a red-blooded American male like, rural American
15:08
would think it's a feminine thing.
15:10
Like, you know, self-care in any way, like moisturizing your face, you
15:14
know, like that kind of thing, like that, to me, was like very valid.
15:19
And I remember when my boyfriend was like, you want to do face masks?
15:22
And I was like
15:27
[makes a questioning face] , you know, on the inside I'm like, yes!
15:29
Please, God, you know, like, that sounds amazing!
15:34
Yeah.
15:35
And also, just a side note, something I've, I've learned and this is, again,
15:38
never something that I like, consciously thought, but I clearly believed, at
15:42
least on some level, is that, you know, like, just because I'm feminine, right?
15:49
Just because I love this doesn't mean that I'm like, you know, like,
15:54
doesn't mean I can't, like, split wood.
15:56
It doesn't mean that I can't change a tire.
15:57
Like, it doesn't mean that I'm like, suddenly, like, weaker or less than.
16:01
Which is like a very, like, just sort of like sexist.
16:03
And, you know, all these -ists thing that, like, really informs our thinking
16:08
and that sort of thing, again, especially if you're from somewhere like I am.
16:13
So, yeah.
16:15
Sorry, did I answer your question, I forgot, I
16:19
kind of forgot what it was.
16:19
I mean, kind of.
16:19
I asked when you started it, but, like, you could talk a little bit more about,
16:22
like, some of the types of things you did as you started to explore your gender.
16:25
Yeah, okay.
16:26
Yeah, I think that's what I was.
16:27
Yeah.
16:28
So the big one and this is my object or objects.
16:33
I thought I might, come up with something that was more... At first I was like,
16:37
oh, I'll come up with something more like symbolic and clever or whatever, but.
16:43
Yeah, the biggest thing, the thing that was like, probably
16:47
the tipping point, is that,
16:51
I, he offered because I was, like, cold or something, and I was over at his place.
16:58
This is before we had an apartment, you know, and I didn't
17:01
have, like, enough clothes.
17:03
He was like, you can wear some of my old leggings.
17:06
You know, because, again, like, he's trans, he has some old leggings and stuff.
17:10
And I was like, yeah, you know?
17:14
And I was like, oh.
17:16
Okay.
17:17
Yeah, sure.
17:18
I, I guess I can, and to me I was like rationalizing.
17:22
I was like, yeah, basically like, you know, long john thermals that I
17:25
wear in the winter time, you know, there's nothing, it's not weird.
17:28
It's fine, you know, I can wear leggings.
17:31
And yeah, they're they're not really.
17:34
But yeah.
17:34
I have they're, they're the leggings.
17:37
They're the
17:39
OG leggings that I wore of his are my object slash objects.
17:46
And yeah, like once I started to wear those and I started to feel
17:50
like feminine and stuff, just like a tiny bit, I was like, okay.
17:56
Shit.
17:58
All right.
17:58
You know, and like freaked me out.
18:00
And I was kind of like, whatever.
18:02
Right.
18:02
But then I like very, very, very slowly started trying more and more things,
18:08
but it became sort of like exponential.
18:12
So, it would go from like trying on leggings and then in like three months I
18:17
might like shave my legs maybe, something like that to it being like, oh my God,
18:26
I'm terrified to wear women's jeans, you know, but I'm going to do it today.
18:31
And then I do it.
18:32
And I feel like crazy for just wearing women's jeans in public.
18:36
Like, not even very tight ones.
18:37
Right?
18:39
To, like, right after the first day I do that, I'll be like.
18:43
It's terrifying, but maybe I'll wear a tiny bit of mascara.
18:48
Maybe I'll be brave enough to wear that out of the house in like two weeks.
18:53
To me, doing it in like two days after and then like, I just couldn't help
18:57
myself and I, like, threw myself into it.
19:01
And it was, it was really fun.
19:04
And it was a, it was the discovery of gender euphoria,
19:08
which I'd heard about dysphoria.
19:10
Like I knew, I don't know if I knew all about it, but, like, I
19:14
knew plenty about it, you know?
19:15
But I didn't realize, like, euphoria.
19:18
Like, I never really heard people talk about that.
19:20
And it really is addicting.
19:22
And when I first did shave my legs, and I, like, got a shower
19:29
and then I put some lotion on, then that felt really incredible.
19:34
As silly as it is, that was like one of the, that was legitimately one of the
19:38
best feelings of my life because I'd been thinking about this for so long.
19:43
Yeah.
19:44
I was like, well, I've done it.
19:45
I've actually done it.
19:47
And I, you know, I couldn't help myself anymore.
19:51
Yeah.
19:54
Yeah.
19:54
That's nice.
19:56
So, you mentioned your leggings was one of your objects.
19:58
You want to talk about the other ones right now?
20:03
The other ones?
20:06
Oh.
20:06
You just said "object/objects," I don't know.
20:09
Oh, yeah.
20:09
By "objects" I meant just because there was more than one leggings.
20:13
Oh, okay.
20:15
Oh, no no, no, I mean, some people did bring more, but I'm sorry, I just
20:18
I just misinterpreted what you said.
20:20
Oh, no, you're fine you're fine.
20:21
Yeah.
20:21
You're good.
20:22
Okay, so, you mentioned that the shaving legs was pretty euphoric to you.
20:27
I have been asking people what is euphoric but also dysphoric to you.
20:33
So can you talk about that a little bit?
20:35
Oh, yeah.
20:35
So we can talk about, like, makeup.
20:36
Like I just, frantically did this morning.
20:39
You know.
20:40
Every day I have to wake up, and, like, shave as quick as I can.
20:45
I mean, if I have more time, of course I'm going to use more time.
20:49
But because I've been, like, I haven't been sleeping very well
20:53
recently, I tend to wake up when my alarm goes off, and then I realize
20:57
it would be better that I just, like, sleep for another half hour or so.
21:02
Because, like, I'm going to feel better for the rest of the day
21:06
with more sleep in me, obviously.
21:09
So, yeah.
21:10
I have to shave.
21:11
And then I got to put on, like, all my makeup, and I have to time this right
21:15
alongside doing all the other normal getting ready things, like brushing my
21:20
teeth, etc. Making sure I have everything in my backpack ready to go for the day,
21:24
making sure everything's charged, and then I have to, like, you know, get dressed.
21:31
And that can be a really, like, euphoric or dysphoric thing, too.
21:36
Because, like, I can wear this thing and I'm like, oh, can I wear this?
21:41
Do I feel like, confident enough to wear this?
21:44
Is this too feminine?
21:45
Is this not feminine enough?
21:47
Will this, like, hide my lack of breasts very well?
21:51
Is this going to, like, really, really emphasize something?
21:55
You know, that kind of stuff.
21:57
So in the mornings, it is sadly usually dysphoric.
22:01
But it can still be really euphoric.
22:04
And I would say like it's very intense, like 50-50 when I put on makeup and when
22:11
I shave if it's euphoric or dysphoric, because sometimes it feels like really
22:15
wonderful, sometimes not so much.
22:17
And it really just kind of depends on my mindset on and like, you know,
22:21
how stressed I am, like how quickly I'm trying to get out of the door.
22:24
Yeah.
22:27
But I will say, you know, like, I think just on the sort of like day to day level,
22:33
what haunts me like more than anything with dysphoria, has got to be shaving.
22:40
Like, my stubble drives me insane.
22:45
It is like, it is.
22:46
It's absolutely the worst.
22:49
Yeah, I, I despise it.
22:53
Yeah.
22:53
Another thing is also my voice.
22:56
I've done a lot of voice training, and hopefully I'm in sort of like
23:00
an androgynous zone right now.
23:02
Just like using, like, YouTube videos and stuff.
23:06
I mean, I like a lot, like, hours and hours and hours and
23:10
hours and hours of training.
23:12
These, you know, going from, like, down here.
23:15
Yeah.
23:16
Like, it's, it's very hard.
23:17
So that's something that can haunt me.
23:22
Another thing is that means I have or, like, had such a distinctive voice.
23:27
And when I talk for, talk with this a bit, it sounds a little less like,
23:31
awkward, you know, and it's a very, like, sort of smooth radio voice.
23:37
And people love it, like, it's very, very, very, unique.
23:44
And it's something that, like, distinguished me.
23:46
It was almost like a trademark.
23:48
I mean, people constantly would tell me, like, you got to go into radio.
23:51
You got to, like, do this.
23:52
You got to do that.
23:54
In high school, even though I wasn't good, at it at all, they begged me to
24:00
do, like, the football announcements.
24:01
Yeah, even.
24:03
But I didn't like football, so.
24:04
Like.
24:05
And they never taught me.
24:06
They said that they kept telling me they would teach me.
24:08
But they never did.
24:09
They never taught me, like, how the game really worked.
24:12
So I was just up there and I was basically rambling, I'd be like:
24:14
and they're going.. and they're like uh... they stopped again...okay.
24:21
And that was that.
24:22
Yeah.
24:22
It was.
24:23
Anyway, I'm getting off track.
24:26
But yeah, so when people talk about my voice and how cool it was, that's not
24:30
such a consistent day to day thing.
24:33
But when that does happen, it really, really, really hurts.
24:39
You know, when people are like, man, you had such a cool voice.
24:43
That, that stings.
24:46
Yeah.
24:48
And then, of course, just like clothes not fitting right or something.
24:54
I really like wearing, like the, like, high waisted pants, which something I've
24:59
noticed, about women's clothes, which I think is hilarious, is they never seem to
25:05
be the right size, like women's sizings are like everything but the right size.
25:09
They're all, like, too big or too small, like, compared to men's clothes.
25:13
They're like, oh, this is oversize and baggy or like, these are tight.
25:16
And also the pants go up to like here, you know, on your like knee.
25:21
It's, it's so, so weird and awkward.
25:24
I love it, but, I'm not used to it.
25:27
So, like, I wear these high waisted pants.
25:29
And just the other day we were hiking and, like, I remember just thinking
25:36
after this really, these really, this, like, sweet lesbian couple.
25:39
I think there are lesbians, they might've been friends.
25:42
It's not important.
25:43
But.
25:44
Yeah, they, they took a picture of us and then, like, my boyfriend-with our phone,
25:49
you know-my boyfriend, like, showed me.
25:52
And I remember, just like, as we kept walking, I kept thinking, like, do I
25:56
just look like some, like, weird dude who just has, like, his pants, like,
26:01
hiked up, like, weirdly high, you know?
26:04
And yeah, it's that that bothers me.
26:10
I feel like there's, like, little things where people will be like, "Ooh.
26:14
What's that?" It's interesting because a big fear of mine, a way bigger than
26:21
what guys think is girls rejecting me.
26:25
Is girls being like, oh, you're not really one of us.
26:28
Which is, I mean, the complete opposite of what has happened way
26:33
before I transitioned, like, a lot of my friends were like lesbians, for
26:38
some reason, like, I don't know what.
26:40
And they were like, "you're an honorary lesbian." So they tell me,
26:43
you know, you know, I'd be like, "I don't know why you're saying that,
26:46
you know, we're friends, but, yeah."
26:51
But, yeah, like, that's a big fear of mine is being, like, rejected
26:54
by girls, that sort of thing.
26:56
I don't care too much what guys think for the most part.
27:00
Because the only thing that, like, I would like, although it would be,
27:04
like, extremely euphoric, you know, is to have, like, some guy, like, hit
27:08
on me or something and like, ooh, you know, but ultimately, I don't care too
27:13
much what guys think because, like, I already got a guy, he's pretty great.
27:19
So.
27:21
Yeah.
27:21
That was.
27:22
That was a lot of dysphoric things, I-.
27:24
Do you have any other euphoric things to like...I don't know, it's okay!
27:28
I mean, it's okay if you don't, but just to-
27:31
Yeah, yeah.
27:31
Euphoric things.
27:32
Yeah.
27:35
I think just, like hanging out with, like, girls, and, like, talking about girl
27:41
things and, like, really like here it is again, most of my friends are girls or
27:45
just hung out with girls and stuff, but there's always, like, a barrier that I
27:47
put up even when they would like to ask me because, you know, like once, once people
27:51
got to know me, like, they could kind of sense, even if I wasn't self-aware of it.
27:56
And they'd be like, you want to go shopping with us?
27:58
Do you want to do this?
27:59
Or like they would like, sometimes, like once a year, a friend of mine
28:03
she'd be like, "do you want to try on make up?" And then I'd be like.
28:08
"What?
28:09
No.
28:09
What the f-.
28:11
What do you, what?
28:12
What?
28:12
No." And yeah, I would, like, freak out.
28:17
But yeah, just.
28:18
Like, actually allowing myself to do all those things feels really wonderful.
28:24
So, I think, like, connecting with other girls and certain
28:27
stuff, feels really nice.
28:29
A friend of mine, possibly today, if we have enough time.
28:33
But we're going to do other stuff is going to take me bra shopping, which
28:36
is something she wants to do, because I've been on HRT and I have enough where
28:41
like, you know, I start to feel them, like, when I go downstairs and stuff.
28:46
Yeah.
28:46
And that's, it's, it's really nuts.
28:51
And, sort of related to this.
28:53
When have you felt most at home in your body?
28:56
I think pretty much every day I feel like slightly more at
29:01
home, with, you know, like,
29:06
you know, just like you developing like breasts, right?
29:10
And that's a big thing.
29:12
My skin is already softer.
29:15
Which something that a lot of, I think cis people aren't really, at least like
29:21
guys aren't really, like, aware of.
29:23
They don't think about.
29:24
But a huge, like, gender marker is like skin texture, you know, like men
29:30
just have, like, much rougher skin.
29:32
Even like my boyfriend, like, as he's, like, on testosterone.
29:35
I notice his skin is, like, roughening.
29:37
And, yeah, like, my skin is softer.
29:40
That feels really good.
29:42
And then, like, I'm already noticing, like, some redistribution of fat.
29:46
Which is nice.
29:47
I actually have very, like, feminine legs, I'd say from, like, the waist down.
29:55
You know, when I'm wearing, like, a gaff and stuff, I actually look pretty passing.
30:00
You know, that's a very limited area, I realize, but yeah.
30:05
So that's nice.
30:07
And.
30:07
Yeah, just every day with HRT, like, it really does make a difference and
30:11
it really is making me feel better.
30:13
Also, my hair is getting slightly longer.
30:16
Today, I still wear this, like, all the time because, not only is my
30:21
hair, like, still pretty short, but, like, I have a horrible hairline.
30:27
It's the worst.
30:28
It's like, far back, you know?
30:29
So I've got to get, like, bangs.
30:32
But, yeah.
30:32
I'm, it's, it's, it's very nice.
30:37
Definitely-my boyfriend's being goofy-definitely something that - I don't
30:44
think this is TMI because we're like, talking about, like, you know, deep and
30:47
dark stuff - but something that's like, just isn't, like, dark, but like, being
30:54
able to, like, see myself, you know, naked, without any makeup on or anything
30:59
is a really, really wonderful thing.
31:03
To be able to see myself that way and not feel like immediate shock and horror.
31:08
Because my entire life, I've always felt very strange in my body.
31:13
Every time I've walked past a mirror, like I always, I never recognized it as myself.
31:19
I never recognize my voice as myself.
31:23
It's all been very surreal, and I realize, you know, it's gender dysphoria.
31:29
But, yeah, like, without any without, like, clothes without make up or anything.
31:34
Just, naked like that, that's a really wonderful feeling.
31:40
Yeah.
31:41
Whatchamacallit, l there's one more thing I was going to quick say.
31:45
Oh, yeah.
31:46
With seeing myself in the mirror and that kind of thing kind of going off of that.
31:49
An interesting detail is I have a very strong, internal monologue, you know,
31:55
I think in, like, full sentences, I am a psych major, and this is
31:59
something I'm really fascinated with.
32:01
You know, you know, I'm simplifying this stuff a bit, but, you know, like,
32:06
internal monologue, like the idea that, like, some of us think more in terms of,
32:10
like, full sentences, you have kind of like an ongoing monologue versus others
32:14
don't really have, like, as concrete, of, you know, they don't thinking in like,
32:19
you know, like, yeah, you get the point.
32:23
Mine has always been like the voice I've heard in my head has
32:27
always been a feminine voice.
32:29
Which I think is interesting.
32:30
I don't think I've met any other trans person, who's said that,
32:34
but, yeah, it's always been, like, very distinctly a woman's voice.
32:38
Which kind of freaked me out for a while.
32:40
I even tried to, as bizarre as it is for a while, like, listen to recordings
32:46
of my voice and that kind of thing and tried to, like, force myself to think in
32:52
the voice of my, you know, this voice.
32:56
Which is I don't know how to explain it, but like, I just
32:59
tried to, I was like, no, I can.
33:01
And then I would like, think something.
33:03
And then I would hear like the voice of my head, of my thoughts.
33:05
And then I'd be like, no, don't think that way.
33:08
Make it sound that way.
33:10
It's it's hard to explain.
33:11
It's weird, but, yeah.
33:17
Yeah, that is-we're going to, okay, we're going to get to OSU stuff in a second.
33:20
But before we got over there, I wanted to like loop back around and ask
33:24
you, because like you, you lived in northern Idaho and that wasn't really
33:29
like a safe space for trans people.
33:31
Did you ever, like, turn to, like, online spaces to try to find community like that?
33:36
No?
33:37
I never I was never really a very online person.
33:41
I mean, like, even video games, right?
33:45
Like, I never really played those online, but.
33:47
Well, that's because I didn't have internet.
33:49
Like, I didn't really have proper internet because I lived in the middle of nowhere.
33:54
Like, I lived in, like, the sticks, you know, way out in the
33:58
mountains, deep in the woods.
34:01
Yeah.
34:03
So, yeah, there wasn't really, trans community out there, of course.
34:07
And, yeah, I can't say I've really ever turned to online stuff.
34:12
My mother has always been like, left wing for the most part.
34:18
You know, she's like a Democrat.
34:20
You know, she's not, like, leftist or anything.
34:21
So, she's not super extreme.
34:23
She's like a, "I like Biden" type person.
34:26
You know, she's always been very supportive of trans people.
34:28
And actually, I'm, good family friends with, I believe one of
34:33
the first people to have gender reassignment surgery in the world.
34:37
Johanna Clarke, who's a really, really cool and wonderful person, close family
34:44
friends, known her for a long time.
34:46
She was the closest thing I ever had to like community.
34:50
Of course, it's one person that's a family friend, so it's not
34:54
really like community-community.
34:57
But, yeah, sorry, I'm getting off topic.
34:59
Long story short, no, I didn't really spend too long on
35:03
online spaces.
35:04
It's fine if you go off topic, you know, it's just meant to, like, prompt
35:09
you to talk about stuff.
35:09
That's cool that you knew her.
35:11
It's really interesting.
35:14
All right, so then you moved to, Corvallis for school, right?
35:21
And so, what has your experience been like at OSU as a whole?
35:27
For the most part.
35:29
Really wonderful.
35:32
Yeah, I'll.
35:33
I'll start with that.
35:34
I mean, like coming here, in such a way, just like, for me, at
35:39
least, incredibly diverse place.
35:42
And everything is wonderful.
35:44
Really wonderful.
35:45
It was sort of overwhelming now because a bunch of, like, weird biases and
35:50
stuff that I didn't realize I had, like, started to make themselves known.
35:56
I started to realize that, or not even necessarily biases like, it
36:01
wasn't just like, it wasn't like, like a deep seeded, like hatred of, you
36:06
know, it was just like fear and not understanding and like, stereotypes.
36:10
I remember getting to know some dudes, and I was like, yeah.
36:15
Do you like, I'm a tough guy.
36:16
And everybody's like, oh, you are a tough guy, man.
36:21
Lots of people thought that, I was even in a frat for-briefly.
36:24
But that's another story.
36:26
But yeah, like.
36:28
I got to know some.
36:29
And then they mentioned, like, that they were gay, you know, and these are
36:32
like, some, like, the most manly dudes.
36:34
And I think it's very funny when conservatives, you know, they think
36:39
that, like, all gay men, are like, [in a nasally voice] "hello sailor."
36:42
You know, like, it's very funny.
36:45
A lot of them are like, the most, like, hyper-masculine dudes you've ever met.
36:51
And yeah, like, I was talking with them, and I was like, "you're gay? My God, you
36:57
know, I didn't realize. That's-you can be like that, you can be?" And like, I never
37:03
like, I knew that they were like that.
37:05
I knew that there were bears, right.
37:06
And I knew that that was a thing you could be and everything, logically.
37:11
But, like, I didn't, I didn't believe it.
37:14
I wasn't like, I didn't consciously.
37:16
I clearly didn't, like, actually believe that.
37:21
Yeah.
37:21
So that's just to give you, like, a taste.
37:24
Oh, another thing that I always tell people because it's wild.
37:27
I mean, people talk about how, like, white Corvallis is, and Oregon is, I'm
37:36
like, what are you talking about?
37:37
Where in Idaho?
37:37
You said you're like, from southern Idaho or are you?
37:40
Yeah, Southeastern.
37:41
Okay.
37:42
Yeah.
37:44
Idaho Falls.
37:45
Was your town whiter?
37:45
Yeah, oh, yeah, I know I hear people talk about how white it
37:48
is here, and I'm like, it's like nothing compared to where I'm from.
37:51
Yeah, yeah.
37:53
Yeah.
37:53
Actually, Kootenai County, my home county, is where the modern-day
37:58
Aryan Nations were started.
38:00
The modern American neo-Nazi movement.
38:02
Yeah.
38:03
We're Jewish too.
38:05
Which is crazy.
38:06
Yeah.
38:08
But no, like, I came here.
38:10
And I was like, wow.
38:11
You know, there's people like speaking Spanish and, like, Chinese
38:14
and, like, all these languages and stuff, and it's really cool.
38:18
Like, I don't remember talking to a black person until I was 15.
38:21
And I remember when it happened, like, it's weird that
38:24
I remember my age, you know?
38:28
Yeah.
38:30
And it was.
38:31
Just a pretty wonderful, accepting place for the most part.
38:35
Yeah.
38:38
So, I guess, do you have any questions or anything with that before I get
38:42
to, like, the other side of it?
38:46
What is the other side?
38:47
The other side is just, like my not so good experiences here.
38:54
I'm curious about the frat.
38:56
I don't know if that's a good side or a bad side.
38:59
You could ask about the frat.
39:00
You're all good.
39:02
So.
39:03
Well, do you know what, like, the griddy dance move is?
39:07
Yeah.
39:08
Yeah.
39:09
So I'm in.
39:10
EOP, educational opportunities program.
39:13
There's, like, a bunch of stuff, like, you know, underprivileged, like, whatever, you
39:18
know, etc., etc.. I'm, I'm also autistic.
39:21
I think that's probably the main reason why I was able to get in there.
39:25
Really wonderful group.
39:26
We came a week early, and we were in room 100, I think it was of the LINC, which
39:33
is like, you know, that giant circle or room, stage in the center, right?
39:36
Yeah.
39:37
And we were with, like, LSAMP and TRIO and like a bunch of these groups.
39:41
And the room was completely packed, like to the gills.
39:45
And, yeah, this was like freshman year again, a week early.
39:49
And this guy was like, "who wants to do a room wide like icebreaker?" We were
39:55
going to do, like, a huge icebreaker.
39:59
And like, the first one was this guy was like.
40:02
"Who wants to do the griddy for a $20 gift certificate to the
40:06
Beaver store?" And I didn't care.
40:08
I had I did not care at all.
40:10
But nobody would do it.
40:11
Everybody was too scared.
40:13
And I've always like, I've never really had like, a fear, at least for a long
40:19
time of public speaking or anything.
40:22
So, it just sort of pissed me off that nobody else would do it.
40:24
And I went up there and I didn't know how to griddy-I still don't know how to
40:28
griddy-and I did the worst griddy ever.
40:31
But, like, everybody knew it was a joke.
40:34
I was being silly.
40:35
I even won, even though other people did it, like, objectively good, just
40:40
because I was the most entertaining.
40:41
And I got extremely famous on Snapchat.
40:45
Like my, my class story on Snapchat and just in general among my class.
40:49
And I got known as "The Griddy Kid." And, yeah, like, it was crazy.
40:57
People, like, I was walking around and girls were coming up to me and they
41:00
were like, "oh my God, oh my God, it's the Griddy Kid! Oh my God, would you
41:04
take a picture with me?" And I'm like.
41:06
"Uh, yeah." And they'd like, give me a kiss.
41:08
And then they take a picture.
41:09
And then there was like, yeah.
41:11
And that would happen.
41:11
Like I couldn't walk like 15ft somewhere on campus without that happening.
41:16
And I didn't even have, like, the OSU story on Snapchat, and
41:22
I had barely used Snapchat.
41:23
I got it to communicate with, like, one friend, but then I got it, and I, like,
41:27
I got sucked into it because this really appealed to my, like, masculine ego.
41:32
Right?
41:33
And then my buddy is like, we got to go to this frat, bro.
41:37
We got to go to this frat, and I, I don't I've never really liked
41:41
groups, you know, like too much of a history of getting rejected from them.
41:45
Right.
41:46
So, I didn't really want to join a frat, but this one frat, Sigma
41:49
Nu, was like, oh, you're so cool.
41:52
Like.
41:53
"We're not like the other girls of frats," you know.
41:56
That's how they kind of, like, billed themselves.
41:58
And I went, you know, and they kept inviting me back, and I was like,
42:03
they're kind of, they're kind of neat.
42:05
They're smaller, kind of more selective frat.
42:08
And like, they gave me lots of alcohol and stuff and I'm like, oh,
42:11
yeah, you know, lots of parties.
42:13
And they were like, "oh, you got to post this stuff, Griddy Kid. You got to do
42:17
this for us, Griddy Kid." And I'm like, okay, you know, like, then they like,
42:23
we're like, do you want to join the frat?
42:25
And I was like, I don't know if I do.
42:27
And they were like, we will even pay for your dues.
42:30
This one guy said that he would use a scholarship.
42:32
Yeah.
42:33
And he even showed me, like, the email, that he wrote to the people
42:37
he was getting the scholarship from saying that, like he was going.
42:40
He, like, asked them if he could use it.
42:43
I don't know.
42:43
That might have even been, like, faked, as you'll see with this story.
42:49
I, I can see your expression.
42:50
It's, it's a wild story.
42:51
So, anyway.
42:53
And this is just the SparkNotes version, right?
42:57
But yeah, they start like.
42:59
Yeah, they're like, you got to do this, you know, you like,
43:02
keep posting this Griddy Kid.
43:04
Griddy Kid.
43:06
And eventually I'm like, you know, I'll trust them.
43:10
I'll trust this.
43:11
And I like, I've talked to you about already, you know, I've never
43:15
really had, like, a male role model.
43:18
I've never really had, like, a big, like, male space.
43:21
Like, I've never been truly accepted into that.
43:23
Even when, like, I got cool and popular, and a bunch of guys, like,
43:30
invited me in, you know, I rejected it.
43:34
I just was too suspicious.
43:37
But I was also worried going into college, I had been such a, like, sort
43:40
of, like, edgy, like, outsider kind of dude, you know, that I wanted to be more
43:45
social, and I thought that it would be.
43:47
I at least told myself that, like, this is the healthy thing to join this
43:51
frat and, like, be social and like, create like, have a group, right?
43:56
You know, and that, that didn't work out.
44:01
So then like, we were talking, right.
44:06
And then, yeah, they like, say, join.
44:10
I hesitantly join, but after I like, signed the thing saying I would join, I
44:17
like really started to try and commit and I started to actually
44:20
care a bit about the frat.
44:23
And then after, the initiation ceremony, like, literally right after the initiation
44:30
ceremony, they kicked me out of the frat, which I have no idea why they.
44:33
Yeah.
44:34
Right.
44:34
Right.
44:34
Like, why would they do it before?
44:36
So, I have a bunch of stuff, on them, like, you know, I can talk about, like,
44:41
their initiation ceremony and stuff.
44:43
But the reason why was, quote, because I made them uncomfortable.
44:47
And by uncomfortable, when I was drinking, which I did drink heavily.
44:51
And that is like an issue.
44:53
I, I understand that, but it's a frat, so, like, I don't it's
44:56
not that wild that I did that.
44:59
I talked about my mental health, basically, and I
45:01
talked about trauma and stuff.
45:04
And I wasn't supposed to do that because that [air quotes]
45:06
brought down the vibe, you know?
45:09
Yeah.
45:09
And that really, I really hurt me and really and really screwed me up.
45:16
So that's basically that's the story of the frat.
45:19
Yeah.
45:20
Wow.
45:20
That's that's really crazy that they-
45:23
Yeah, it is, it is wild.
45:25
What year was this?
45:26
This is freshman year.
45:27
This is the first term of freshman year.
45:29
All of these things happened like, within like a very short period of time.
45:35
Like meeting my boyfriend, the Griddy Kid thing, you know, becoming famous and
45:39
then, like, joining the frat, because it was like, just after Thanksgiving.
45:44
It was like.
45:45
I mean, just before Thanksgiving break that me and him met and,
45:50
like, pretty quickly got together.
45:53
Yeah.
45:58
But like, what year was it, like
46:05
2021 or?
46:05
And what was like, 2022?
46:05
I think.
46:07
Yeah, I think 2022
46:12
Interesting.
46:14
I've.
46:14
I mean, I'm not on the Snapchat class story or anything.
46:18
So, I didn't see anything about it, but I've been here since 2020, so I was
46:20
like that Griddy Kid thing is crazy.
46:23
Yeah.
46:24
Okay.
46:24
So, you mentioned that there was a bad side to all this.
46:26
Do you want to talk about that now?
46:28
Yeah.
46:28
So "bad side" to be clear, we're talking about like, like how I
46:33
felt, accepted/rejected by, okay.
46:37
Like, at OSU or is this just in general?
46:40
Yeah.
46:40
At OSU.
46:41
So here at OSU.
46:41
Oh hold on, I'm
46:46
going to quickly plug in my computer, it's losing battery kind of fast.
47:03
Okay.
47:04
So, and this is a very recent thing.
47:14
I tried to set up a Trans-support group thing.
47:19
I elaborate on that more in a second here at OSU, for trans and non-binary folks.
47:28
And, well, that, that didn't really go so well.
47:34
Yeah.
47:34
I was talking with people at the Pride Center and that kind of stuff about it.
47:38
Well, I'll start from the beginning.
47:40
I was talking with my therapist, Ed.
47:43
He's at the Pride Center a lot.
47:44
Wonderful.
47:45
He really helped me figure out myself.
47:49
Really, really great, dude.
47:52
And he was talking about, like, some stuff that, like, maybe the trans
47:56
support groups like that could be set up.
47:58
Would be set up soon.
47:59
And I mentioned it to him, and he was just like, you could set one up.
48:03
And I was like, I can do that!
48:05
Look at me, you know?
48:06
So I just went over to the people at the front desk and I asked, hey,
48:11
like, do I, can I, what would I have to do to set one of these up?
48:16
As he said I should.
48:17
And they were like, oh, you should talk to Cindy, the director.
48:19
And I was like, okay, so I did that.
48:22
And then I started talking with Cindy, the director, and some of
48:24
the counselors there and stuff.
48:27
And very quickly they were sort of like, oh.
48:30
Oh, yeah, you got to do this.
48:32
Okay.
48:32
You should do this.
48:33
And then they sort of suggested, the therapist theAnd then they sort
48:35
of suggested the therapists there, Ed and Laena-I love them, they're
48:40
great people, but it was just kind of
48:44
confusing and everything.
48:46
They were like, oh, well, you know, maybe it should be more
48:48
of a student organization.
48:49
It should probably be more student led.
48:52
And I was trying to be, as I've transitioned and stuff be more like,
48:59
in my mind, humble, and not want to do what I do so much but sort
49:05
of follow other people's lead.
49:07
Because I felt I always had to be in charge.
49:12
That was part of my masculine ego to be in control, to be in charge.
49:15
But,
49:19
I thought I should trust them, but that meant I was kind of going in a bunch
49:24
of different directions because a bunch of different people were telling me,
49:27
to do, I should do different things.
49:30
Basically, what we came up with is we would use the upcoming trans
49:38
resource fair, which was supposed to happen, Friday, a week or two
49:43
ago, you know, but it was canceled.
49:49
We were going to use that in order to get a bunch of members together, so that we
49:54
could vote on what specifically this would look like, if it would be something that
49:58
would model more like, Lesbi-social, or if it would, look more like a traditional
50:05
support group, that kind of thing.
50:07
And we would talk about it and we would create this.
50:10
The logic behind it is very good.
50:13
Some of the logic that like Ed gave, that it should be, that because, one
50:19
of the very hard fast is that this is a support group, right, that would
50:26
need a lot of support from CAPS, that would need a lot of outside stuff from
50:31
the college, it would be too reliant on the college and as a result, kind
50:35
of unstable and unpredictable; so, it should be like led by and for like
50:40
trans and non-binary students at OSU, which I think is a wonderful idea and
50:47
I know a lot of other trans people and non-binary people and stuff, and
50:53
like everybody said, I should do this.
50:55
Everybody said it's a good idea.
50:57
And I've been overwhelmed, like, a family member that's dying, they have this like
51:03
rapid form of brain cancer, there's just a lot of stressors in my life in general.
51:09
But I put time and effort into this.
51:14
And I was like, okay I'll do what I can.
51:18
But then they canceled it.
51:21
They said that I couldn't table at the last moment week-of.
51:26
And I was just about to have fliers printed, I was working on the sign, I had
51:30
created an Instagram, done all this stuff.
51:33
The reason why is because we talked, we talked, there's this conversation that
51:41
we had had-we as in me and a few of the staff at the Pride Center-weeks before.
51:50
Where, I mentioned, just sort of offhand, in a conversation where we
51:56
were talking about transphobia, and we had been talking for awhile, I
52:00
mentioned- so what I said was, and I'm
52:04
paraphrasing but I didn't really share any more than this, and it was
52:10
genuinely about this short, and I just told them I struggle with internalized
52:16
transphobia, which is why I view sort of transphobia, racism, homophobia,
52:21
that sort of thing, I view it, more as like a disease in a lot of ways.
52:27
And that's just something that we need to reckon with as treating it
52:31
as something that we need to heal.
52:33
And that's why we need to still like talk to conservatives and that sort of thing.
52:40
And because there's a lot of conservatives that don't know they're trans, right?
52:46
And there's a lot of people who are on the right and they might not be
52:51
trans, but the only way that they'll be softened and they'll be less hateful is
52:55
if they're exposed to us and they see that we're human and that kind of thing.
52:59
And first off, that, this first thing, I don't know for sure, but I
53:06
strongly suspect that the folks at the Pride Center just didn't like that.
53:13
They don't seem to even like the suggestion that we should talk to
53:17
people who are remotely right wing.
53:20
They really... yeah.
53:24
I've heard them talk before, and I just get the sense that they
53:26
don't really agree with me on that.
53:29
But the thing that they did say for sure, particularly, is that they thought
53:34
it was inappropriate I had shared, I forget the word that they used,
53:39
it was something like, but they just didn't like that I had shared that I
53:45
struggle with internalized transphobia.
53:46
They said that
53:50
bothered one of the members there-not one of the members-one
53:54
of the staff, and I mean, we had had a really good conversation.
53:58
There was even this one girl, she was apparently one of the two people that
54:05
were bothered by it, who earlier in the conversation had thanked me for being
54:10
so genuine, she said, which I thought was very sweet, because you know, like,
54:17
it's hard for me to feel genuine these days.
54:20
I feel more genuine being out, but for the first time ever-sorry this is just
54:25
a quick tangent-but for the first time ever, well not quite ever but for a
54:31
very long time, I felt social anxiety and stuff, because I was never anxious.
54:36
Like for so long, I was never anxious as this "tough guy," I was never
54:40
worried about what other people thought because it was a mask, right?
54:43
I was worried about what other people thought for myself, if that makes sense?
54:47
I wanted to make sure that I could prove to myself, right, that I didn't
54:52
have to be liked, that didn't really matter, I didn't have to be accepted as
54:56
long as I was seen as this dude, right?
54:59
That was all that mattered.
55:00
So I wasn't really anxious.
55:01
That's why I was okay with getting up on stage and doing the griddy, you know?
55:06
But now that I am authentic, it's spooky.
55:11
So anyway, so
55:15
that was a really nice compliment.
55:16
And in my mind, that sort of gave me permission to share
55:20
just a tiny bit more, you know?
55:24
I don't know, I don't think it was such a bad thing, but they ended up, like, a week
55:31
later, this one, sort of like, basically like the PR representative for the Pride
55:39
Center-he's a good guy, but, you know, I disagree with him on a lot of things-he
55:46
met with me, in private with Cindy.
55:49
So they met with me to talk about the resource fair, and
55:53
everything and preparing for it.
55:55
And then they also talked about this, and they were very,
55:59
very nice, at least outwardly.
56:02
I love Cindy, yeah, and I like him, but
56:11
I just got the sense that some of the people at the Pride
56:14
Center don't really like me.
56:17
And because of that,
56:22
at least to my mind, that's ultimately the reason why they just didn't
56:28
want me to create a support group.
56:30
They at the last moment-I put all this work into it-said no.
56:35
And I think that, I don't know, the Pride Center has a very sort of corporate vibe
56:41
to me, like a very sort of like corporate America very like polite, but hollow.
56:50
It just feels very superficial and that sort of thing.
56:56
I can go more in depth, but I feel like I kind of lost, I don't feel really
57:03
accepted by a lot of the queer community here, which is a very big deal for me
57:09
because I'm afraid of losing community, afraid of losing that sort of stuff.
57:17
I've always been hesitant of it, and it sort of reminds me of the frat, actually,
57:22
when I was like, I can trust these people, you know, I can join this group.
57:32
But there's a lot of people I know who are trans and non-binary, who have,
57:39
who were pissed when they heard that.
57:42
And they also don't really feel comfortable in the Pride Center.
57:46
They don't really like it.
57:49
Yeah.
57:50
I'm, I'm so sorry that happened.
57:52
Like putting all that work into it and just having it canceled.
57:55
And I don't think it's uncommon for trans people to have internalized
57:58
transphobia, so I don't know.
58:00
Yeah, definitely a situation happening there.
58:03
Yeah,
58:13
I've kind of asked most of the questions, but I was kind of curious about your psych
58:17
degree and whether that has anything?
58:20
I don't know, like what you were planning on doing with that, maybe?
58:23
Oh, yeah.
58:23
Definitely.
58:24
So,
58:27
well, so, just kind of, I think is interesting is I always had this sort of.
58:31
Like, blind spot, with
58:34
gender stuff because I've loved psychology.
58:37
I'm, I'm quite autistic, and I love, I have, like, a few things
58:42
that I really, really, really love.
58:45
Researching and understanding.
58:46
Like philosophy, literature, sociology, that sort of stuff.
58:52
And then psychology.
58:53
Right.
58:53
But like, I always just sort of like my mind blanked when it
58:58
came to gender and sexuality.
59:01
I always just like, for some reason, I have no interest in
59:04
learning anything about that.
59:05
I don't know why.
59:06
You know?
59:09
Of course, it's just because I was afraid and I was avoiding it.
59:12
I realize that now.
59:14
But now that I've indulged that, I've become really, really
59:18
fascinated with those things.
59:20
I'm
59:22
not sure what specifically I want to do with it.
59:25
I'm not too worried because I know I have such an intense passion and interest for
59:29
psychology that I'm not really worried about, like, you know, becoming lost.
59:36
Like, I'm sure I'll find something.
59:37
And, you know, I'd be okay with going into research or, or, like,
59:42
clinical practice, whatever.
59:44
But, yeah, something I am very fascinated by is, have you ever heard of the
59:53
- probably not, because he's pretty, he's fairly obscure - But the French
59:57
psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, before?
1:00:00
Okay.
1:00:01
Fascinating.
1:00:03
Love him.
1:00:04
He's.
1:00:06
He's pretty bleak.
1:00:07
He's pretty dark.
1:00:08
And talks about, like, you know, they call him, like, the French
1:00:11
Freud, which I think is sort of an insult, even though he liked that.
1:00:15
He talks about like, repression, and all that typical psychoanalysis stuff,
1:00:20
but it has a very deep existential basis, and I agree with it just really,
1:00:28
really, strongly when I read his stuff.
1:00:30
It was it was something where I had, he was one of the handful of thinkers where,
1:00:36
like, I didn't just agree with them.
1:00:39
I had already thought some of these things.
1:00:41
For example, a really famous, teaching of his, theory of his, is the mirror stage
1:00:46
of development, which is where you see yourself in a mirror as a child and for
1:00:51
the rest of your life, you are essentially chasing this image of yourself in the
1:00:57
eyes of other people, seeing yourself the way you see yourself in a mirror, right?
1:01:03
You know, which, it's a fundamental misrecognition, right, though,
1:01:07
because we're not really our bodies like we are in a physical sense,
1:01:10
but it doesn't truly represent the essence of who we are, you know?
1:01:14
But we keep chasing that so that we can, in our mind, become like
1:01:19
an object alongside other objects, I think, is how the Lacan puts it.
1:01:23
Which is why when, you know, like Kurt Cobain scratches an itch on the back
1:01:26
of his head with a shotgun, we're all surprised because he has everything that
1:01:31
he could possibly have to see himself as an object alongside other objects,
1:01:37
to see himself as his ideal self.
1:01:39
You know, he has the fame, the fortune, everything you could possibly want.
1:01:44
Why would you do that?
1:01:45
You know, he's finally got it.
1:01:46
And just the idea that we keep chasing these things to make ourselves happy.
1:01:51
This next part of our identity.
1:01:53
Once I get that, I'll be happy.
1:01:54
You know, we keep offloading it, like, you know, I work hard in
1:01:59
school so I can go to college.
1:02:00
And once I get in college, I'll be okay.
1:02:03
But once you're in college, you're like, oh, I gotta work hard in
1:02:05
college so I can get that good job.
1:02:06
But once I get that good job, I'll be okay, right?
1:02:09
You get that good job.
1:02:10
Oh, now you got to get promotion, retirement, etc. You know, it can be like
1:02:14
that new car can like, you get, like, a date with a cute boy or whatever, you
1:02:19
know, it's just something, but once you get that, once you get to that point,
1:02:23
your desire has to go in another direction because it's not really filling that void.
1:02:27
It's not filling that existential void of "who am I?", everything like that.
1:02:33
And I think that everything, I wrote a big paper on this arguing that,
1:02:37
everything with a psychological or every like disorder with a
1:02:42
psychological, cause, right.
1:02:46
Everything that is like a psychological disorder, under a very, very, very
1:02:51
strict definition of psychological that is as separated from any
1:02:56
kind of, like, neurological, biochemical stuff as possible.
1:03:00
You know, so just purely like thoughts and that kind of thing as much as
1:03:05
you can, that all has an existential basis, you know, even like OCD, right?
1:03:11
You know, it's about control.
1:03:13
You know, it's about like feeling like we have some sort of effect
1:03:15
of the world when really we don't.
1:03:18
Basically, philosophically, I have a pretty like, honestly,
1:03:22
like at least I think most people would describe it as, bleak.
1:03:26
Sort of existentially absurdist outlook on the world.
1:03:31
It's pretty specific.
1:03:32
But,
1:03:36
yeah.
1:03:37
I guess with psychology, I'm definitely more on the sort of
1:03:42
theoretical-philosophical side of it.
1:03:45
Yeah.
1:03:47
Yeah, that mirror theory is really interesting.
1:03:49
I've never heard about that.
1:03:51
But I feel like it kinda-
1:03:52
You gotta you gotta look into him.
1:03:53
Are you a psych major?
1:03:54
I'm an anthropology major.
1:03:56
Oh, okay.
1:03:57
I love anthropology, too.
1:03:58
So.
1:03:58
Yeah, it's a good one.
1:04:00
Yeah, my partner is a psych major, and so, you know, I'm exposed to it.
1:04:04
It feels that
1:04:06
way.
1:04:07
Yeah, that's very interesting.
1:04:09
I, I'm out of questions now.
1:04:10
So, did you have anything else you wanted to share?
1:04:12
Well,
1:04:19
I'll just ask, your thesis.
1:04:21
What exactly is
1:04:25
the rundown of your thesis?
1:04:26
I'm curious.
1:04:27
Yes, so,
1:04:30
I'm collecting oral histories from ten different people.
1:04:35
You know, you're one of them, all across the gender spectrum,
1:04:39
if you will, you know, whatever.
1:04:41
Just like to, like, because I want to go into archiving.
1:04:45
And so, it's to cement the experiences of queer students at OSU.
1:04:52
And I'm going to donate them all to the to the archives, to the OSU Queer Archives.
1:04:56
That's so cool.
1:04:57
Yeah.
1:04:58
It's fun.
1:04:59
And I'm also going to do, like, an anthropological analysis of it.
1:05:04
I really like that.
1:05:05
Yeah, that's I'm in the honors college too, and I'm.
1:05:09
Yeah, I, yeah, for me, like, I'm kind of combining like, psychology
1:05:14
and writing, and, for mine, through my writing, I'm sort of using, like,
1:05:19
sort of like Jungian, sort of like active imagination, that sort of thing.
1:05:23
Where you like, explore yourself basically through creativity.
1:05:27
And it's particularly focused on, like, gender and trauma and whatnot.
1:05:31
Yeah, so with that, I guess just one question.
1:05:35
I have is, my boyfriend actually thought, this is really cool.
1:05:39
Do you need anyone else?
1:05:40
Because you could interview him.
1:05:44
I don't actually.
1:05:45
You were my last interview, actually.
1:05:47
Oh, okay.
1:05:48
Oh, cool.
1:05:49
Yeah.
1:05:50
Yeah.
1:05:50
Well, I am actually going to have, like, I have to - I'm also a queer studies minor,
1:05:55
so I'm doing like a - we have to do a practicum to, like, fulfill the minor.
1:06:00
So I'm going to host like an open mic of this essentially.
1:06:04
Where it's like anyone can come and share their story.
1:06:08
And then that's also going to be donated to the archives.
1:06:11
You got to tell me about that.
1:06:13
I will, well I was I was going to let all my interviewees know.
1:06:15
So yes, you will hear about it.
1:06:17
Okay.
1:06:18
Yeah.
1:06:18
That that sounds, I genuinely think that your thesis and that,
1:06:21
like, it sounds really cool.
1:06:24
Cool.
1:06:24
Thank you.
1:06:25
Okay.
1:06:30
I think I'm probably good to go.
1:06:31
Anything else before in the recording?
1:06:31
[Lilith shakes her head no] No?
1:06:31
Okay.
1:06:31
Thank you for this.
1:06:31
Nope, I think I'm good to go.
1:06:31
All right, good.
