00:01
Okay.
00:02
Today is February 10th, 2024.
00:05
I'm here with Maxwell Deborde, and we are over Zoom, and we are both in Corvallis.
00:10
Are you in Corvallis today?
00:12
Uh, I'm in Eugene, actually.
00:13
Eugene, alright, that's fine.
00:15
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as part of my
00:19
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:21
Okay, welcome, good morning, how are you doing today?
00:24
I'm good, how are you?
00:26
I'm good.
00:27
Alright, let's get started right into the basics.
00:29
So can you, just, repeat again how you identify and what your pronouns are?
00:35
Yeah, um, I identify as a male and go by he/him
00:39
He/him, okay,
00:43
to start let's go back to the beginning.
00:45
And by the beginning I mean your childhood.
00:48
Did you have any experiences in your childhood that you thought were really
00:53
formative to the creation of, like - well not the creation of, but - like,
00:57
solidifying your identity and your gender?
01:00
What activities were you involved in, stuff like that.
01:03
Yeah, so, um, as a kid, I was involved in, I was really into history.
01:11
Like World War Two history.
01:13
I kind of outgrew it, I'm not really into it now, but I was
01:16
really interested in that kind of stuff, so I was looking at planes.
01:18
I wanted to be a fighter pilot, and that sort of thing.
01:22
Um, as far, um, any experiences that really shaped my gender, I just, I kind
01:28
of remember figuring out that, because I am straight, I just kind of remember
01:32
figuring out, like, going from not really being attracted to anything and then
01:38
realizing oh I'm attracted to, um, girls.
01:43
And that, um,
01:47
that, I don't know, I mean, that wasn't anything, like, huge because
01:51
obviously that's how most people, um the majority of people, um, are straight.
01:58
But it wasn't anything special or anything, um, but, I just, I would
02:03
say I had a very normal coming up to figuring out my identity
02:10
You say, it's very normal.
02:12
Like what do, what is normal to you?
02:14
Like, what does that mean?
02:15
Basically, like no, um, no internal, like, struggles no, like,
02:21
external um battles with anyone.
02:25
I mean, obviously it's going to be accepted that I'm a straight man, you
02:31
know what I mean, so I've never had to deal with any sort of, um, conflict.
02:35
Either internal or external.
02:39
Okay.
02:42
Did you do any sports as a kid?
02:45
I played lacrosse.
02:47
I golfed a little bit.
02:50
I skied a lot.
02:52
Mountain biked.
02:52
I more, um, I played lacrosse but I wasn't that good.
02:55
I was always more into individual sports than team sports.
02:58
So, um, I usually, I would kind of just do stuff on my own a little bit.
03:04
Why do you think you were more into individual sports?
03:07
I really, um, I get really flustered when I have to work with a team
03:12
and I always, um, overthink it.
03:15
And I like, I played soccer, too, I didn't mention that.
03:19
I played soccer, I was playing intramural soccer last year and I still, like, I'm
03:23
pretty decent, I'm not a bad player.
03:25
I just get really overwhelmed, and when I'm by myself I'm like kind of in my
03:29
flow and don't have to rely on anyone.
03:32
I don't like having to-I don't like people having to rely on.
03:36
I'd like to be more relying on myself, and also like just naturally as I
03:42
did those things more and more, I found to enjoy them more and more.
03:47
So, I'm a pretty big skier.
03:49
I was on the ski team in high school, the freestyle ski team,
03:52
and I was a coach, and I worked at Mount Hood Meadows as an instructor.
03:56
Nice.
03:57
So are you, are you from Oregon, then?
03:59
Yeah, I'm from Hood River
04:01
Hood River, cool, my coworker's from Hood River.
04:05
Okay.
04:08
So, as a kid, did you have any like, role models for, like, who you thought
04:13
a good man was, or who, the kind of man you wanted to grow up to be?
04:16
Yeah, I would say definitely, just my dad.
04:19
I think that's probably pretty common answer, but he always, I mean, I mean,
04:24
still, like I honestly think, that I've grown to even, um, see him as a role model
04:28
more now that he's older because I kinda realize that like, like, I'm getting to
04:32
the real world and that sort of thing, and how he was really able to, uh, like,
04:36
he's done very well for himself after starting at not a great, um, place in
04:42
his, um, just like his, um, financially, and he's been able to like pull himself
04:49
up by his bootstraps, that sort of thing.
04:52
So like, but as, and I mean, and on top of that, I feel like he definitely
04:58
is very aware of certain, like, how he treats people, that sort of thing,
05:03
and he is very self-aware of how he acts in certain situations, and I
05:10
kind of modeled myself after that.
05:13
And I definitely see a lot of similarities that I do even just
05:16
subconsciously that have followed his, like that I see in myself, or
05:28
like parts of him, parts of him I see him myself.
05:32
So you mentioned, like,
05:36
you mentioned a couple of things that he did, but I was wondering what
05:39
specific things you see in yourself.
05:41
So this one is not good, but we both really get-I'm so hyper-aware
05:50
of being a public inconvenience.
05:53
So like, if I'm standing in the middle of a restaurant, and people are like
05:56
trying to like- I hate, or like, if I'm playing golf and there's people
06:00
behind us, and they're faster than us, I'm just, it almost gets to the
06:04
point where I can't even like, enjoy.
06:06
It's always just, that's always in the back of my head.
06:08
Like I don't want to be an inconvenience for anyone, and I think he also,
06:14
like, he gets, I don't do this, but he gets so flustered when we, he
06:18
won't- When we order a drive through.
06:19
He won't let us order for ourselves.
06:21
He tries to order for everyone, and then he gets mad at us when we have
06:26
to like, and then they ask like, do you want fries, you know, like,
06:28
what type of drink do you want?
06:29
And he gets so mad.
06:30
But he won't let us order for ourselves.
06:32
I don't get it, but he gets really overwhelmed by that sort of thing
06:37
So, like, the type of person where, if you get the wrong order at a
06:40
restaurant, you're not gonna like, send it back like that kind of thing?
06:44
Personally?
06:45
Yeah, you or your father.
06:47
I probably pick, pick it off, if it's like tomatoes or something.
06:49
I like tomatoes.
06:49
I'll probably just pick it off.
06:51
But my aunt and my mom will definitely be like, call the
06:56
waiter over and send that back.
06:58
But I don't
07:02
like when they do that.
07:02
Okay I'm kind of
07:08
still curious a little bit about your father, and like, is he... does he
07:14
follow-I mean, like you mentioned him being like very aware of himself in public
07:18
spaces, which I wouldn't say is, maybe a normal - my father certainly wasn't
07:22
like that - So, but, do you think he was like a, like a normal father like in
07:29
that, not in that sense like, maybe-I'm sorry-like, in the emotional sense like,
07:35
was he like good with his emotions?
07:36
Because I know a lot of fathers, right, who don't really deal with that side.
07:40
Right, yeah, no.
07:40
He always encourages me to uh, um, like he tells me, like, he says, you can cry.
07:46
You can express your emotions.
07:48
You can do all these things.
07:50
He tells me he loves me all the time like that sort of thing.
07:52
He is pretty big on that.
07:54
Wanted to make sure that I knew that.
07:56
He is, um, he was raised Mormon.
08:02
He's not Mormon anymore, but he says that it, they kind of teach you to,
08:07
like, suppress that, that sort of thing, and he didn't want that to be
08:12
instilled on me.
08:15
But he, I would say, as far as dads go, he's probably he's pretty emotionally
08:20
open as well, and he tries hard to... another thing that I think that he
08:26
does that I do is when I'm in, like, a bad mood and my girlfriend's like,
08:34
sometimes she'll be doing stuff that annoys me, but it's not because of her.
08:37
It's because of my already mood, and it's important for me to tell, to
08:41
remember that, and not like, snap out at her when it's not her fault,
08:45
and that sort of thing, and I think I kind of got that from him as well.
08:51
Nice.
08:52
Okay.
08:52
You mentioned that your father was raised as a Mormon, but you weren't.
08:56
Were you raised in any religion, or just?
08:59
We're like Christian, not, I don't go to church or anything.
09:03
I just believe in the Christian God.
09:05
Um, but I'm not super religious.
09:07
I just believe that there's something up there.
09:10
That's fair.
09:11
Do you think that, like, influenced your gender in any way, or even like for your
09:17
perceptions of other genders, I guess.
09:20
Um,
09:23
kind of.
09:24
I guess they kind of hold the idea that, like the traditional gender roles.
09:29
And while I see that there are obviously a lot of other options around that, I do
09:35
see that as, cause, like, my dad works.
09:38
My mom stays at, stays at home.
09:40
They kind of have had those traditional gender roles, by choice.
09:45
My mom was a teacher before I was born, and she just wanted to raise us, um,
09:50
and so like, and like, I see that as a viable option, I think it's a choice,
09:57
and you can do it, how you want.
09:59
If I was making enough money, and I think it'd be great for my kids if my
10:02
wife stayed home and raised the kids.
10:05
I know I enjoyed it, having a mom there all the time.
10:07
I never had to go to daycare or anything.
10:10
Yeah, I think it is really nice to have your mom home.
10:14
My mom never was.
10:15
So I kind of wish I would have had that.
10:16
Hm, mhm, yeah it was great.
10:19
Okay, um,
10:22
you mentioned also that you were from Hood River, do you think growing
10:26
up in Oregon had any impact on you?
10:30
I know it's a pretty, like, especially that area, is a very liberal area.
10:34
Yeah,
10:38
as far as asking how living there has impacted my outlook on gender a
10:43
little bit, is that what you're...?
10:45
Yeah!
10:45
Okay, I would say no, I mean, it's a pretty, it's a pretty normal town, I
10:53
guess, that there, I don't know Hood River is like, it's diverse, but it's not
11:02
super... It's, like, diverse, but racially diverse.
11:05
It's like half white, half Mexican.
11:08
Probably like half, people think, I mean, there is a lot of Liberals in Hood River.
11:13
But there's also a lot of Republicans in the upper valley, and so you get
11:16
a good, you get a mix of everything.
11:19
I think it was pretty run of the mill as far as gender.
11:24
There wasn't any, like, anomalies, I would say.
11:30
Okay, good to know.
11:34
Do you, do you think that social media has impacted your perception
11:38
of your gender in any way?
11:41
Do you, I guess I should ask first, do you use social media?
11:43
Yeah, I have an Instagram and Snapchat.
11:49
Um, as far as it's influencing my view on gender, I would say,
11:55
I mean, no, honestly, I don't.
12:02
I feel like
12:06
my view on gender was already formed before I had social media, and it really
12:12
hasn't affected it since it's been formed.
12:17
What did form it then?
12:19
Just, I guess my childhood experiences.
12:25
Just being on those sports teams, being in public school,
12:34
learning, I mean, I guess,
12:41
I think that just, honestly, just mingling with other people my
12:44
age has influenced it the most.
12:48
And I think that I have a very standard, um, view.
12:53
Yeah, that's okay.
12:56
Um,
13:00
so, um, I'm curious if you have any like, this is, I mean, maybe more of a
13:06
question for those who aren't cisgender.
13:08
But like, do you have any goals in your mind, for, like, how you
13:11
want to present yourself and like where you feel most comfortable in?
13:15
Yeah, I do.
13:16
I think that I'm pretty focused on like, becoming a better person, man [air quotes]
13:25
. Whatever it is, and I have a pretty good idea of what that is, um, or what
13:32
I want, like what I want to look like.
13:35
I think that that's it's someone that is
13:40
level-headed.
13:41
Someone that doesn't, is very in control of their own emotions, actions, um, and
13:48
that's something I've been working on.
13:49
I'm not something that I need to work on.
13:53
I think it's someone that...
13:56
I think it's someone that, I mean, as a man, I do kind of believe that it's
14:01
my duty to protect whoever, like my girlfriend, my family, that sort of thing.
14:10
And so that's another aspect that I believe in, that I want to work on.
14:15
Um, not that they can't themselves, but, I mean, I do view it as a
14:21
little bit of a duty that I have.
14:24
Um, where do you think that idea comes from?
14:26
Because I think that is a very big idea associated with masculinity,
14:30
like even, like, butch women, I know feel that way particularly.
14:34
Where do you think that comes from?
14:39
Popular culture?
14:41
Um, and growing up my dad, also.
14:46
He, he has a plan.
14:47
If someone breaks into our house he has a gun in his nightstand.
14:52
Yeah, so probably just instilled in me.
14:54
I've been doing, and not just like a gun or anything, I've been doing a lot of
14:58
martial arts training, that sort of thing.
15:02
I, not that it, I just, I know it probably won't ever happen, but I
15:06
feel like if you don't have the will and the capability to protect your
15:13
loved ones in your home that you don't really, you don't have the privilege
15:20
or you shouldn't...you shouldn't...as, as a man, I feel that if I don't have
15:26
both the will-'cause some people don't have the will, they won't do it, they
15:30
won't-and the capability you shouldn't be able to...you shouldn't have that.
15:41
You shouldn't have that.
15:41
As a man.
15:43
And I recognize that that's pretty traditional but it's
15:49
something that I believe in.
15:59
You keep on like mentioning things that are, like, very traditional.
16:03
Do you think there's, I mean, obviously you subscribe to it.
16:05
But, you feel like, maybe, like popular culture kind of looks down on people
16:08
that like follow these traditional roles?
16:10
Yeah, I do.
16:11
I mean, I'm not.
16:12
I know I'm not all traditional.
16:14
I'm very, I'm not really.
16:18
I'm all over the place in terms of my beliefs.
16:19
That's just one of the more traditional beliefs I do believe
16:22
in, and as far as that goes, I mean,
16:25
if like, I'm not saying that they can't do it themselves.
16:30
I'm just saying that they can do it, and I should be able to do it
16:33
too, you know, protect themselves.
16:37
And so yeah, I do.
16:38
I do think that it is looked down upon pretty heavily, but also I feel like
16:43
those views are also associated with other views that I don't believe in,
16:48
and I get why, I get why, like it would come across as, cause I think, like,
16:53
if you, if someone's talking about, like that sort of thing, you would
16:56
kind of quickly, just, like, assume that they believe these other things.
17:01
And I think that if people took the time and like talked to me, they'd be like,
17:06
"Oh, okay, he's not like those people."
17:11
The other things you're referring to are like conser-
17:15
Would be a hardcore Republican.
17:15
... yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
17:18
Okay, um,
17:21
this kind of relates to the last question I asked, but when have
17:23
you felt most at home in your body?
17:26
Whether that was like a time in your life, like an experience you had-whatever works.
17:36
Good question... I would say, I would say when I am, I do jujitsu.
17:43
It's like a kind of a wrestling thing, and I would say, when I'm doing that.
17:46
You kind of enter a flow state where your like, your body and your mind kind
17:49
of like, just connect, or whatever.
17:51
I know it sounds, like, corny or whatever, you kinda feel like you're, I'm moving
17:55
as one like, whatever all this energy, that type of - you know what I mean?
17:59
But you're connected, and you just, you don't even think about what you're doing.
18:03
You just kinda enter a flow state and like a lot of people will close their
18:05
eyes while they do it, cause they just, like, are feeling the, your part-,
18:10
your wrestling your partner, you know.
18:13
Yeah, how long have you been doing that for?
18:17
About twenty weeks.
18:19
Twenty weeks, nice.
18:20
I know it's a weird way to put the time, but we do it by the week.
18:25
I feel like it makes sense.
18:27
How soon did you start to feel that flow state that you get into?
18:31
Oh, pretty right away.
18:32
I'm not good, at all, but you don't need to be good to tap into that.
18:38
A lot of people will do it high on, like, marijuana, because
18:42
they think it could like, like it amplifies that that flow state.
18:49
I don't do that, but a lot of people do.
18:51
I've never heard about that, that's interesting.
18:53
It's definitely very common in the culture.
18:57
Are you doing that through a class at OSU or is it like outs-?
19:02
I have, I have and I am also doing outside.
19:06
I did the PAC class twice.
19:08
So, you go to OSU,
19:16
do you think your college experience has influenced your gender in any way,
19:19
or like even moving away from home?
19:22
Anything like that?
19:28
I would, I would, well, I would say that, I was talking to one of my
19:33
girlfriend's friends, and she was telling me, 'cause she's a pre-med bio, bio
19:39
something and I was asking her 'cause she was complaining about her finals,
19:42
and she was doing a lot of studying and all this stuff, and I was just asking
19:46
like, well, obviously, I know why she's putting herself through it, to get a
19:50
degree and a good job and make money.
19:51
But I was like, why are you doing such a hard thing?
19:55
She was basically, she was like, I don't want to ever have to rely on
19:59
a man to have any, like, power over me financially in any way, and then
20:06
into, I don't want my relationship to be transactional in that sense.
20:10
And I was like, wow, that's really that's super respectable.
20:14
And it shows that you have a lot of self-respect.
20:17
And it's really impressive.
20:18
And I just kind of realized, both man, men and women, that there are
20:25
very, what's the word, It's like they're fierce, you know.
20:29
Some people are just fierce, and it's impressive to see that.
20:33
Like, I mean, it's come a long way, you know, since the traditional housewife
20:37
nuclear family, that sort of thing.
20:39
And I was like, wow, respect to her, you know.
20:48
Okay, um.
20:50
So, I'm going to ask you about your object now, you picked one out?
20:53
So what did you bring today?
20:56
I brought a hammer
20:59
Cool, alright, so what made you pick that?
21:02
So, I'm at my girlfriend's house right now in Eugene, and she has a
21:06
bookshelf that she needs to get built, and she was like, I need a man to
21:10
come help me build this bookshelf, and I need you to bring a hammer.
21:14
Because, and, I was, I was trying to figure out what I was going to pick and
21:17
that was like perfect, um, and so I mean, just, even though gender roles are less
21:27
accepted nowadays, I think that that there's a lot of like subconscious,
21:31
like, reverts back to them like that, for example, like she's not, like,
21:36
traditional, that sort of thing.
21:39
I mean, she can't.
21:41
She can't build it herself.
21:42
She needs me to build it, you know.
21:44
Um, and so, I don't know, I just, there are definitely certain qualities in
21:49
men and women that lend themselves to do certain things more effectively.
21:53
And it's just, it was just funny to me that, like, like, she
21:58
just assumed that I'm a guy.
21:59
I can put together a bookshelf, you know.
22:01
Can you?
22:01
Have you ever, do you have any experience like, making stuff like that?
22:05
Building stuff?
22:06
Yeah, yeah, my dad and I build a lot of stuff.
22:08
Cool.
22:14
Interesting.
22:15
Hammer, I never expected to get that one, that's cool.
22:20
Um, okay.
22:25
No, I feel like that makes sense why you brought that, because
22:27
you mentioned a lot of like,
22:31
helping to support, like, not necessarily your family, but,
22:36
like, the people around you.
22:38
Yeah, acts of service.
22:40
Yeah, that's cool.
22:43
Okay, well, that's all the questions I have, so, do you have anything else you
22:57
want to add?
22:57
I would just say that, like as far as
23:05
my "idea of gender," just to, like all encompass that, I believe, I believe that
23:13
we, I believe that gender is-there's one thing that is more maybe traditional, I
23:21
don't know-I think that there are certain masculine traits and certain feminine
23:26
traits, but that are, like, inherently feminine or inherently masculine.
23:31
I know that some people don't believe that, but I feel that, obviously, men can
23:35
have feminine traits and women can have masculine traits, and that was, like, a
23:39
distinction that I kinda had been thinking about and made to develop my viewpoint.
23:48
Yeah.
23:50
No, I mean, it makes sense, like the whole point of gender is to assign social
23:55
roles with, like, within a culture.
23:57
So it like, I think it's, I mean, you keep on saying like gender roles
24:02
aren't really...people look down on it, but I think they're fine!
24:05
Like, they're there for a reason.
24:06
They work for some people and they don't work for others.
24:09
Exactly, really the only thing we need is to, like, have the freedom to,
24:13
like, choose a different one if the one we got assigned is not right, so
24:16
yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense.
24:18
Okay.
24:20
Well, thank
24:22
you for talking with me today.
24:25
Yeah, of course.
