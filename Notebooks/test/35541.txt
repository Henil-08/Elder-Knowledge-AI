Today is February 24th, 2024.
00:03
I'm here with Ollie Parsons over zoom, and I, I'm in Corvallis today.
00:08
Where are you at today?
00:09
I'm also in Corvallis.
00:11
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as a part of my
00:14
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:17
Welcome to the interview.
00:19
Thank you.
00:19
All right, so to start, do you want to just tell me a little bit about
00:23
your childhood and if you had any, like, significant experiences that
00:27
really helped your-like, were really formative to gender in any way?
00:31
I
00:35
mean, I had a I had a pretty good childhood generally.
00:43
A big thing for me was I was in ballet for most of my childhood.
00:48
Which is a very gendered environment.
00:51
And so I, you know, it took it actually took me a while to sort of,
01:02
like, I did question my gender even when I was little.
01:06
But it took me a really long time to entertain those thoughts at
01:09
all because, I was just in such an aggressively gendered environment.
01:15
And, my parents are pretty liberal generally.
01:22
And, but, they had never talked to me about that, ever.
01:25
Like, I learned about gay people from the Percy Jackson books.
01:29
Like, I like they just never really talked about that.
01:33
So I just didn't really think about it or think of it as something
01:36
that I could talk about, you know?
01:39
So,
01:42
I only really started sort of like exploring my gender
01:45
when I stopped doing ballet.
01:48
Because, like, like when I was, like, in, like, middle school, I was doing
01:52
ballet all the time, but I really wanted to cut my hair, but I couldn't cut my
01:55
hair because I, we all needed to have, like, our hair and buns and everything.
02:01
And so, you know, I wasn't really able to express that side of me.
02:05
I was also like, a pretty, people pleasing child.
02:08
So, everyone in my family thought of me as very feminine because I did ballet, and,
02:15
and I was like, I don't know, I read books and stuff, and I was like a good student.
02:22
I don't know, like, I, I mean, I don't know, I wasn't a great student, I
02:25
have ADHD, so, but I don't even know.
02:31
Sorry.
02:31
I have to get in the zone.
02:33
But I guess probably
02:38
the most like formative parts of like developing my gender was
02:42
probably just being online, honestly.
02:46
And, like, in, like, late middle school and early high school, I started sort
02:50
of being more active online and like seeing, you know, more queer people.
02:56
And like a lot of my friends at the time were queer.
02:57
But, most of us were like identifying cis at a time and like, that
03:02
wasn't, you know, that sort of thing generally comes a little later.
03:05
I feel like, and.
03:10
Because I did know I was queer from, like, a pretty young age.
03:13
I just didn't really know what to call it, you know?
03:19
Sorry, I, I should have maybe, like, written something up, say, like, make sure
03:23
I hit every, every point or whatever, but,
03:27
yeah, I started being, like, active online and in, like, fandom community
03:31
and stuff, which I'm not really anymore, but it was definitely like
03:35
a big part of, like, figuring out who I was because people were just very
03:40
casual about sharing their pronouns and talking about gender and stuff.
03:44
And so I just sort of like that made a lot of sense to me.
03:47
And I really understood it even before I realized that I was non-binary.
03:51
And I went through many years from basically eighth grade to like junior
03:56
year of high school, of like switching my pronouns all the time and like, you
04:00
know, like my Instagram bio would like go from like she/they to they/them to
04:05
like they/she and they'd be like, no actually I'm like just cis I go back
04:08
to she/her and like that was like many, many years where I just like did not.
04:16
I was pretty confused about my gender generally.
04:22
Because it's like I am non-binary and that can be kind of like a it's not a
04:28
confusing experience once you realize it, but it can be a kind of confusing
04:32
experience to try and figure it out because it doesn't really fit into,
04:35
like, you know, by virtue of just like literally by definition, it doesn't fit
04:40
into any of like the categories that like we're generally given in society.
04:46
So
04:49
yeah, I'm just yapping, I don't know.
04:54
No, it's good, it's good.
04:55
One other thing, also, like when I, so like I, that being out online
05:03
and like being active online and stuff gave me also the ability to
05:06
express my gender and try things out.
05:08
Right.
05:09
Like try like names out and everything.
05:10
I actually didn't change my name until senior year despite, like being
05:14
out of some binary from, like, from junior year, because that was a whole
05:22
other thing to think about, I guess.
05:25
And, what really ended up making me want
05:31
to, change my name and then eventually go on hormone therapy - I've been on T
05:34
for a little over three months - was,
05:37
I met my girlfriend who was a trans woman, and, she and one of her friends,
05:43
who is also a trans woman, were, like, both on estrogen and sort of like,
05:49
you know, I had other trans friends, but most of us were sort of still in,
05:52
like, I guess the, like, baby phase.
05:55
Right?
05:56
And like Ellie, my girlfriend, had like very much sort of thought about it a lot.
06:01
And she was on hormone therapy and stuff, and she sort of knew a lot about that.
06:04
And like, it was really cool seeing someone who had done that
06:09
and taken the leap to like, start hormone therapy and like, knew a
06:13
lot about trans issues and stuff.
06:14
And like, she was very happy, with like, also she like very much like fully accepts
06:23
her gender identity, which is something that I didn't really and at the time and
06:28
still have trouble with, mostly because of my family, which is a whole other thing.
06:35
But, I was like, I was dipping my toes in being in, like, being trans and like,
06:44
because I was too afraid to really to take like, the full leap, you know.
06:48
But Ellie like really helped with that.
06:49
And I'm like, much happier now, like being on hormones and everything.
06:57
But yeah.
06:58
So I don't know if you can get anything from that, but,
07:04
yeah.
07:05
Yeah.
07:06
I'll just, I wrote a couple of things down.
07:08
I'll just start, like, back at the beginning.
07:10
So you said that you questioned your gender when you were little.
07:13
Do you remember anything specifically about that?
07:18
I mean, I do remember one time, that was kind of like, I still remember
07:23
this because it was like, "whoa" to me.
07:25
When I was a kid, I must have been like 7 or 8 or something.
07:29
And like, I used to take like gymnastics classes.
07:31
And I went to my gymnastics class in, like, a t-shirt and like,
07:36
shorts or whatever, instead of like.
07:37
A leotard that I usually wore because, like, my leotard was
07:39
like in the wash or something.
07:41
And like some kid asked me, like, are you a boy or a girl?
07:44
And I was like, [mind blown motion with hands] oh, that was like a crazy question
07:48
that no one had ever asked me before.
07:50
And like, I thought, I literally like, I couldn't get it out of my head for like
07:55
a few days because I was like, like part of me was like, how could they ask that?
07:59
Like, I'm like, clearly a girl, you know?
08:01
And then part of me was like, like I was thinking about it way too
08:05
much, you know, because like, the other part of me was like, okay, but
08:08
like, why did they ask that, though?
08:10
And like, what did they mean by that?
08:12
And like what, what do I, why am I thinking about it?
08:16
And like, why is this like in my head all the time?
08:20
And so that was like crazy for me.
08:23
But like, I just wasn't really given the space to question that
08:28
or the ability to express, like,
08:32
you know, what I wanted and everything, like, most of my clothes were
08:35
hand-me-downs, so, like, I didn't really.
08:37
And, like, we didn't really buy new clothes that often.
08:40
And so, like, I didn't I couldn't really go, like, you know, I
08:44
don't know, like, try to like, I mean, I was pretty young, right?
08:46
So I couldn't really, like, express myself beyond what my parents were like, giving
08:50
me to wear and do and look like, you know.
08:54
And like I said, I was, like, very much a people pleasing child.
08:57
So, like, I was like, okay.
08:58
Yeah, this is like what I have to do, you know, like, I have
09:00
to, like, go along with this.
09:03
But that was definitely like a crazy experience.
09:07
As, like, small as it sounds, you know, I was like.
09:12
Like I just never thought about that before and it
09:15
made me feel very conflicted.
09:16
So.
09:20
Yeah.
09:23
Yeah, I don't know.
09:26
Oh.
09:26
That's good.
09:27
That's nice that you remember that.
09:28
I don't really remember anything from my childhood.
09:30
So,
09:37
you mentioned that being non-binary is kind of like a confusing
09:40
experience to figure out.
09:43
Can you talk about that more?
09:45
Maybe, if you have anything?
09:47
I don't know.
09:47
I, I don't find it confusing now.
09:50
You know, like, I really understand my gender a lot, and I think it's
09:55
it's it's very silly and funny and, it doesn't really fit into any
10:00
category I can try to put it into.
10:04
But I do understand it now.
10:06
Like, I'm not confused, but,
10:11
when you're trying to figure that out, I think it can be confusing.
10:14
It's confusing for any trans person because you have been told you're this
10:18
thing for your whole life, and then you're like, you're realizing that
10:22
doesn't fit you, and now you're having to figure out where you stand, you know?
10:26
But, I think, like for me, it was it took me a while to
10:31
figure out because I was like.
10:37
You know, like.
10:40
I don't know.
10:44
I don't know what I'm trying to say.
10:49
Like, I guess I wanted to fit myself into a box and I wanted to feel happy
10:53
about the box I was fitting myself into.
10:56
And that just wasn't really an option with how I was feeling on the inside, you know?
11:01
And so I was like, just it usually I was confused, but it
11:09
usually wasn't distressing for me.
11:10
You know, like, it was usually just like, okay, I'm gonna figure this out.
11:15
I would get distressed, though, because I would be like, something's
11:18
wrong, and I don't know what it is.
11:19
You know.
11:22
And.
11:23
Yeah,
11:26
so I don't think the confusion is necessarily a bad thing, and
11:29
it leads to acceptance, right?
11:32
But, like, being non-binary, like, like can be.
11:37
I mean, just being queer in general, you know, you're trying to figure
11:40
out, like, who you are and everything.
11:42
And, like, a lot of things are telling you that's not who
11:44
you are, or you're just like.
11:46
Like it's a phase, you know, and that kind of thing.
11:48
And that can be confusing for a kid.
11:52
I think it's a lot more confusing for queer people growing up in, like, a
11:56
heteronormative culture than it is for heterosexual and cis people to
12:01
see queer people, if that it makes sense, like because people talk about
12:04
it being so confusing or whatever.
12:06
It's a lot more confusing for that person who's trying to figure out their
12:11
gender identity in the society that doesn't give space for that, you know?
12:17
But I don't know.
12:18
I don't want to be like, oh, it's so confusing to be trans because, like, I
12:22
don't feel confused anymore, you know?
12:25
But yeah, yeah.
12:28
Yeah.
12:28
No, no, that makes sense.
12:29
Yeah,
12:33
and I get it.
12:34
I'm trying, I'm trying
12:35
No, it's good, it's good.
12:37
It's kind of like.
12:38
Well, it's not something that people talk about a lot, so I think it's okay.
12:42
Take some time.
12:45
You mentioned trying to fit into the box of a label, but I know a lot of
12:49
non-binary people kind of see, like, non-binary is like a box, like without,
12:54
like or, like a label without a box.
12:56
Is that like, I know you see it?
12:57
Or...
12:58
Yeah, I mean, I definitely see it that way.
13:01
I find it very, a lot more freeing to, I mean, like, I, because I
13:07
used to want to fit into a box, you know, that I could easily define.
13:12
But it's so much more freeing for me to not really fit myself into a box.
13:16
Like, I don't really define myself by many, like sub-labels of non-binary.
13:20
You know, there's like a lot of those and I don't really
13:23
care about those personally.
13:24
I'm and like, I'm like trans masculine, but I don't really identify like, I don't
13:31
identify as, like a trans man, you know?
13:33
And so, like, I'm just like trans-masc non-binary, you know,
13:37
and that's about as deep as I'll go.
13:39
Because I don't really want to fit myself in a, into a box, and I don't really want
13:42
to think about it too hard, honestly.
13:42
I just want to do, like, what I feel.
13:42
And so, I don't know, like, I definitely have wanted to fit myself into
13:57
a box before, but it was definitely more of a coping strategy or
14:01
feeling like, I need to do that.
14:05
And, you know, it didn't end up working very well.
14:10
And I'm glad I don't feel that need anymore, but, yeah.
14:15
Yeah, you mentioned that your girlfriend was kind of, like,
14:20
not really a role model, but somebody that, like, inspired you.
14:23
Where, do you know of, like, any other role models?
14:31
I mean, yeah, I definitely wouldn't call my girlfriend, like, a
14:33
[air quotes] role model, cause that's sort of silly, you know?
14:35
But, like, I definitely-she definitely did inspire me.
14:38
And like, I was able to see in her, like, how happy it was,
14:41
how happy she was to have, like, fully accept herself, you know?
14:47
But, I don't know, I guess I had, like, some, I like people online who
14:55
I knew, who were like adults and had been queer and trans for a long time.
15:04
And, those were definitely I would say those people were probably like
15:07
the closest thing I had to a role model for, like gender and sexuality.
15:12
Because I didn't have a lot of that in real life.
15:15
I
15:18
don't like my parents don't really know, like, I don't really know
15:22
any queer adults in real life.
15:24
Like, I know, like, a couple, you know?
15:27
But, it's not that.
15:29
It's not some people like, not people that I really would feel comfortable
15:32
talking to about stuff, you know?
15:36
So I guess most of my role models were probably online, and that might be why I
15:42
really sort of started like, like thinking about my gender more when I got online.
15:49
And I definitely think that, like, being online is a very common experience for
15:53
queer people because and figuring yourself out more online, is also a very common
16:00
experience because, like, there's not really space to do that in real life.
16:05
And if there is, it's usually created by queer people, which is fine.
16:08
But then when you're like a child and you don't or you're just starting
16:12
to think about things, you're like, oh, well, I don't want to go
16:14
there because like, that's not me.
16:16
You know, like, I don't know, like, where do I fit in, you know?
16:18
And so, like, being online is like, I mean, it's often you're pushed to
16:24
online communities because you feel isolated, you know, but then like,
16:27
the online communities are there for other people who feel isolated.
16:29
And then you can like, find community, you know.
16:32
Yeah.
16:33
Yeah.
16:35
So I don't know about role models, I guess I had them online,
16:37
but not really in real life.
16:39
Yeah.
16:40
No, that's, that's good.
16:42
That's valid.
16:46
You keep on mentioning, like, online spaces.
16:48
Does that like, did that include social media or is that like go to
16:52
like something separate from that?
16:55
Yeah.
16:56
For me it was mostly Discord.
16:57
I honestly started getting into like online communities through fanfiction.
17:02
And I would join discord servers.
17:07
Like, for the fanfictions that I was reading.
17:14
And then that sort of like, would create new communities and stuff.
17:20
And I don't know.
17:21
So, sorry, what was the question I like I don't know why, but like, your exact
17:27
wording just slipped out of my mind.
17:30
Like, was there any relation to social media at all?
17:33
Oh, yeah.
17:35
I did have social media, but it was not related to like, the, to, I mean,
17:41
I guess if you count Discord as social media then like, yes, but, I had like
17:45
Instagram and stuff and Instagram was kind of my place to try and
17:49
conform as much as possible as well.
17:52
So like, I was trying to explore my gender, so I was like, have
17:55
my pronouns on my Instagram bio.
17:56
But I was, like I said, a big people pleaser and I still am, but like,
18:00
and I really wanted to portray and an like an aspect of myself that
18:05
people would like, on Instagram.
18:07
And I didn't feel like being queer or whatever was like, you know, or especially
18:15
trans, like, I was out as queer to basically everybody in my community.
18:20
As a middle schooler, I was I was like bi, you know, but I still
18:25
wanted to be, like, palatable.
18:26
Right?
18:26
And I didn't want people to think I was weird.
18:28
So, like, I definitely was not like on Instagram.
18:31
I would post, like, pictures of me, like, you know, like being really feminine and
18:35
like, you know, like trying to be as, like, pretty as I could, you know, and
18:39
trying to make it seem like my life is like, perfect because that's I feel like
18:42
kind of what Instagram is for in ways, so
18:48
I don't know if it really had a big connection to social media, unless
18:53
you count, like, Discord, which I guess you would, but, I don't know.
18:58
Yeah, I was mostly just like I was on discord servers and like,
19:00
had online friends and stuff.
19:03
I was on Tumblr.
19:05
I forgot about that.
19:07
I don't know why I forgot about that.
19:09
I guess most of my online friends were actually made over Discord, like, so
19:13
not on Tumblr, but I did have a Tumblr account where I talked about "Avatar:
19:16
The Last Airbender." [JB: Nice.] Which is still one of my favorite shows.
19:22
Definitely.
19:22
I would say my favorite show.
19:24
And I have written fanfiction for it.
19:27
I was pretty active in the fanfiction community in like, high school.
19:31
But yeah.
19:32
Anyway, yeah, I feel like that's kind of all.
19:34
Um.
19:36
Yeah.
19:42
Like you mentioned Avatar, were there any other, like, forms of
19:45
media that you were really drawn to?
19:49
I mean, I'm like such a stereotype for this, but like, I did really like,
19:53
children's television and, like, TV shows, like, you know, I watched "The Owl
19:58
House." I didn't watch all of "the Owl House," but I really did enjoy what I saw.
20:01
I watched "She-Ra and the Princesses of Power," which is
20:03
like the queerest show ever.
20:06
I watched, wait, there's another one that's in my head that I feel
20:10
like...well, there's "The Dragon Prince." I watched "The Dragon Prince."
20:16
I don't know if you know any of these, but you're nodding, so I think you do.
20:19
Probably.
20:20
I also started getting into anime a lot in, like, middle of high school.
20:23
So I had a whole anime phase for a few years.
20:25
So, yeah,
20:30
I mean, like, I did, like, I guess watch a lot of like that, you know, and like that,
20:37
that was like, in general the like online spaces for shows like that are very or
20:43
like overwhelmingly queer, which is nice.
20:47
So yeah, I don't know.
20:50
Fandom is just overwhelmingly queer, generally.
20:53
Yeah, I would agree.
20:57
So, you mentioned that you've been on T for three months.
21:00
[OP: Yeah] Do you want to talk about that any more?
21:03
You don't have to if you don't want to.
21:05
Well, it's been awesome.
21:08
It's been really cool.
21:09
I've been on gel, which is like, because there's, like, gel and shots.
21:13
And gel, it's like, it's just like a gel that you apply to your arms every day.
21:18
And like, for some people, I think that's like a lot of work, but I really like it.
21:22
It's like, therapeutic for me.
21:23
You know, it's like, okay, well, like, every day at least I have to wake up
21:26
and I need to, like, do this, you know?
21:29
And so it, like, gets me out of bed.
21:32
But,
21:34
yeah.
21:34
No, it's been really cool.
21:35
I've, like, really liked all the changes I've had.
21:39
I, wanted to be on it earlier because I did come o-I mean, I came out in
21:44
junior year and I was like, really on and off about whether I wanted
21:48
to go on hor-I'm a freshman now, so it's been like 3 or 2 years...ish.
21:52
How long has it been?
21:53
It's been almost three years.
21:56
Yeah...
21:59
But
22:03
I wanted to be on it earlier.
22:04
Like I definitely like, especially when I met Ellie and she would talk about
22:07
how HRT was really helpful for her.
22:09
I was like, oh, I actually like do want to do this.
22:11
Like I'm realizing that I actually do actually want to.
22:15
But my parents didn't want me to.
22:17
So I waited till I got to college to do it because I knew I could do
22:22
it through Student Health Services.
22:24
Which is where I am getting my T from right now.
22:29
But, yeah, my parents have, especially my mom, have been probably the hardest
22:36
part about, like, the hardest part of coming out and being for the
22:42
past few years, just being trans.
22:44
Definitely.
22:44
I haven't really encountered too much significant, like,
22:51
roadblocks except for my parents, who did not react well and still
22:58
don't really understand at all.
23:03
And when I told them I wanted to go on T, well, my dad got really freaked
23:08
out and well, I told my dad because I was scared of telling my mom.
23:11
Because my mom, my dad just sort of, like, doesn't understand, but
23:14
my mom has, more of an ideological thing against trans people.
23:19
And so I was I'm a lot more comfortable with my dad in general.
23:24
My relationship with my mom is very strange.
23:26
But
23:28
I told my dad, and, like, he sort of freaked out, and he was like,
23:31
you're, like, ruining your body.
23:33
And it's a terrible, awful thing to do to your body, you know?
23:36
And it's like, not natural and everything.
23:38
And then like, I was like, okay, well, I'm still going on it.
23:40
And then my dad was like, okay, actually it's fine, like, and like,
23:44
you don't have to tell your mom, like, I'll tell her and like, I'm actually
23:47
going to support you or whatever.
23:49
And then because my mom was away on a business trip at this time.
23:51
She came back, he told her, and then she must have convinced him not to
23:55
support me, because then they sent me a two-page, double-sided typed letter
24:00
about how I shouldn't go on T. And so, yeah, I mean, my dad would probably
24:08
be better at it, like, be better with it by now if it weren't for my mom.
24:12
But they do usually use the right pronouns for me and call me Ollie and everything.
24:17
That's been a long time in the making, but they do that now, which is really good.
24:22
But yeah, so that's been not great, but I've really, really been
24:29
happy that I've been on T. It's like been super awesome for me.
24:32
The only time I ever feel bad about it is when my mom tries to make me feel bad
24:35
about it, but, it's really just awesome.
24:39
It has improved my life so much.
24:42
So.
24:42
Yeah.
24:44
Yeah.
24:44
Well, so it sounds like maybe moving out of your parents' house must have
24:49
been a pretty good experience for you.
24:51
Yeah.
24:52
It definitely was.
24:53
My parents' house was kind of difficult to live in for a while.
25:02
It sucks because, like, my little sister still lives with
25:06
my parents, like she's 13.
25:08
And so, like, I want to still have a relationship with her, but a lot of
25:12
the time, like, I just like, like I do go back to Eu-so I'm from Eugene.
25:16
And I do go back to Eugene a decent amount, mostly to see my
25:20
girlfriend who's still there.
25:24
And I, like, stay at my parent's house when I'm there, and that's fine.
25:27
You know, it's okay.
25:30
But I'm, usually when I'm there, I'm, like, always out doing stuff because
25:35
I don't really feel super comfortable in the house, but I don't want to,
25:40
you know, leave my sister behind.
25:42
Right.
25:42
But, she's getting older, so hopefully she'll be able to, like, come visit me,
25:46
you know, or, like, we can do stuff that isn't in, like, the house, you know?
25:51
So.
25:52
Yeah.
25:55
So you're at OSU now, and you mentioned that you're getting your T through
25:59
OSU's Student Health Services.
26:02
How has your, like, experience at OSU, then?
26:06
It's been good.
26:07
Yeah.
26:08
I mean, like, I.
26:11
Yeah, it's been great.
26:12
I like, you know, I wasn't super nervous for, like, the transition and everything.
26:20
No pun intended.
26:21
I was, you know, like, I was pretty excited.
26:25
Mostly because I was like, I'm getting out of my parents house, but also just because
26:28
it's college and it's exciting, you know?
26:30
And I haven't really encountered that many people who have
26:33
been weird about my gender.
26:36
People do, like, misgender me and stuff, but that's okay.
26:40
You know, like, I mean, I don't, it sucks, right?
26:42
But, it's, I've also had people gender me correctly, especially as I have,
26:48
like, been on the T more and stuff.
26:51
That's cool.
26:54
So yeah, overall, it's been a good experience.
26:58
And it's been awesome that I can just like, like getting T from Student Health
27:03
Services was like really easy-easy, but also felt like a, you know,
27:07
thought out process and everything.
27:09
So.
27:12
I, you know, I've been really happy with it.
27:14
Generally, just like with OSU in general, I mean, I've had, like issues outside of
27:19
gender, you know, like trying to adjust to the vibe, you know, like college and
27:24
everything and like, making friends.
27:26
That's hard.
27:26
But like, that doesn't really have to do with my gender, you know?
27:34
Yeah.
27:35
Yeah.
27:35
All right.
27:35
I'm gonna I'm going to loop back around.
27:37
I forgot to ask you a question earlier.
27:38
Okay.
27:38
Oh, it's alright.
27:40
So, can you talk a little bit about, like, what is euphoric to you, in terms of your
27:45
gender and what is maybe dysphoric to you?
27:49
Yeah.
27:52
I mean, I guess I just have mostly dysphoria about my body.
27:56
Obviously, that's the thing, right?
27:58
And how I'm seen by other people also is a big thing.
28:01
I
28:03
mean, dysphoria is very social, right?
28:06
So it's like, like there is a component of dysph-and this is true for everybody,
28:10
I think-there is a big component of dysphoria that is obviously just
28:14
physical dysphoria about your body.
28:15
But there's also a really big part of dysphoria that's about like
28:19
how you're seen by other people.
28:21
And being nervous, and even if other people are being accepting, it's still
28:26
like, well, do they actually really think of me as this or do they just think of
28:30
me as like a confused girl or like a [airquotes] transtrender or whatever?
28:34
Like,
28:37
I don't know.
28:43
I lost my train of thought.
28:45
Um.
28:47
I totally lost my train of thought.
28:49
I'm sorry, I don't know, um, but-
28:54
Another, another part of the question was: what is euphoric to you?
28:57
-and euphoria, yeah.
28:58
Yeah, I, I mean, I have, like, clothing that I really like.
29:06
That makes me feel good.
29:08
You know, I, it's really euphoric to not just see the results of testosterone,
29:14
but also the, just the fact that I'm on testosterone is really euphoric to me.
29:20
And it gives me euphoria to put it on every day.
29:24
And I really look forward to it and stuff.
29:28
I've been, like, working out recently and going to the gym, and
29:31
that gives me a lot of euphoria.
29:33
Because it's like, oh my God, I'm getting buff or whatever, which is
29:36
like, I don't I'm not the kind of person who wants to be, like, super
29:39
muscular, but like, it's fun, you know?
29:41
And like, I'm definitely going to build muscle better than I ever
29:44
have before while I'm on T. So,
29:49
and I don't know, also just like being silly with gender, like, I don't know
29:55
how I, how I can really explain that, but, like, I like wearing dresses
29:58
and stuff, just, like in a boy way.
30:01
You know, like, I like, I mean, maybe not really in a boy way, but
30:06
in, like, in an almost boy way, I don't know, it's hard to explain.
30:10
But like,
30:13
yeah.
30:14
And
30:17
so, yeah.
30:17
Just like.
30:21
I don't know.
30:22
It's hard.
30:23
Like a lot of my clothes make me really euphoric.
30:26
They're just like I have.
30:28
I mean, I kind of wear the same thing every day, honestly, which it's mostly
30:31
a coping mechanism for the fact that I really like how I look in certain outfits.
30:36
But like other outfits that I haven't, that I, like, haven't,
30:39
like, checked with myself or whatever, that I haven't worn a lot.
30:41
I'm like very prone to getting dysphoric in them.
30:45
So it's like I have to make sure that I'm wearing outfits that I like.
30:49
But the outfits that I like, I really do like and make me feel cool and stuff.
30:55
So yeah, clothing is a big part of being-of feeling,
31:00
like, euphoria and everything.
31:03
Just like, most of my friends are trans and just, like, being with my friends
31:13
and feeling really affirmed and stuff, I guess is like very euphoric to me.
31:20
Like, I
31:23
don't know.
31:25
Sometimes Ellie calls me her lesbian boyfriend, which is kind of true
31:28
because-So I do identify as a lesbian, which is kind of silly for
31:32
some people to understand, kind of difficult for some people to understand
31:35
because I'm like trans masculine, but I do identify as lesbian.
31:39
And so yeah, I am a lesbian boyfriend.
31:44
And I think that's really funny.
31:45
And in general, I just like, enjoy experimenting with stuff.
31:50
It's harder here because I, like, don't have all my clothes and everything,
31:53
you know, like, I don't have all my stuff, but, you know, it's okay.
31:57
And, yeah, I don't know.
32:01
I'm trying to think, like, there are random things that give me
32:05
euphoria that don't really have anything to do with gender, actually.
32:12
But, like, I don't know, like,
32:18
sometimes I get, like, dysphoria about, like, how my room looks or something.
32:22
I'll be like, does it look too feminine?
32:23
Like, would someone think this was like a girl's room and
32:25
stuff, which is like, silly.
32:27
And I'll think it out about, like, my items too.
32:29
Like I'll be like, like my phone case.
32:31
I'm like, does this look feminine?
32:32
You know, but then, like, I have, like, a cool leather wallet
32:35
and I'm like, oh, that's cool.
32:36
That's, like, masculine, whatever.
32:41
I don't know.
32:43
It's like silly because there are a lot of things that just don't
32:45
really have anything, literally nothing to do with gender.
32:48
But I just, like, ascribe some kind of sense of euphoria or
32:53
dysphoria to them for some reason.
32:56
Yeah,
33:00
I don't know.
33:00
Speaking of objects, what did you bring today for your object?
33:04
Yes.
33:05
So I brought my DND dice.
33:08
So, I love DND, and I didn't really mention that.
33:13
I kind of forgot, but also, like, I couldn't really find
33:16
a good way to tie it in.
33:20
It definitely, like, I probably should have tied it in because, like, I picked
33:24
my DND dice because they were very, not the dice specifically, but DND.
33:29
It was very important in, like, shaping my gender and stuff, but I guess I
33:32
was thinking more like in the far past, you know, because DND is like.
33:36
I mean, I have been playing DND for a while, but I only ever really
33:39
started, like, using it to explore my gender, like, pretty recently.
33:44
Because, like, I started playing DND when I was like 11 or 12 with my dad.
33:49
But like, as I've gotten older, I've sort of used it as a way to,
33:53
like, explore myself and stuff.
33:55
So yeah, that's why I brought dice.
33:57
And they're pretty cool.
33:57
They're metal.
33:58
Yeah.
33:59
Very cool.
33:59
So, yeah.
34:07
Can I ask who you play as most of the time?
34:11
Well, I have a few characters.
34:14
At the moment, I mean, I have many characters that are sort of in, like,
34:17
hiatus, you know, because a lot of the time I'll, like, play a game and then
34:20
it will get put on hiatus and stuff.
34:22
But like the two active campaigns that I'm in right now, I
34:26
play a rogue, Kieran Haschak.
34:29
And he's like a spy and he's pretty cool.
34:31
And then I play a monk, whose name is Nora, and she's like Yuan-Ti,
34:37
which is like a snake person.
34:38
I don't know if you play DND, but I love snakes.
34:41
They're my favorite animals.
34:42
So I was like, I should play the snake person.
34:45
But it's interesting because, like, I don't usually play female
34:48
characters in DND, because I sort of run the risk of feeling dysphoric.
34:54
But I love Nora, and she's just like me, for real.
34:59
And,
35:03
I don't know, I also, I mean, DND is very important to me because I think I use
35:07
it as a way to not only explore my own gender by playing characters that either
35:13
are sort of manifestations of my gender or are different genders for me, you know?
35:19
I also use the DND as a way to like, honestly, just like process trauma and
35:24
things that have happened to me in my life because, I can sort of, I don't know,
35:32
project onto my characters, honestly.
35:36
And I think all the DND characters are self inserts to an extent.
35:39
And I wouldn't say most of my characters are self inserts, really, but they
35:44
have a lot of pieces of me in them.
35:47
And like Kieran, for example, he is trans, he like, he is canonically trans
35:54
and he is like, his whole fate, his whole story is like a trans allegory,
35:57
basically because he used to like be a spy for the evil empire, basically.
36:03
And then he defected and he is like on the run now and he's working for, the like,
36:09
they're not really great, but like for like, good guys compared to the Empire.
36:15
He's working for them, but he's still trying to find a sense of
36:18
identity, and, he, he doesn't feel like he fits in anywhere.
36:25
And, he sort of tries to, like, compensate for feeling lost by, like, seeking
36:30
pleasure and being like, you know, irresponsible and stuff, you know, whereas
36:36
like, but like, he is responsible and he is a good spy and everything, but
36:40
he like, he's just constantly sort of floundering and looking for identity.
36:44
And I think that that like is a step in that you have to sort of go through
36:52
in that process of being trans and, because it is about a search for meaning.
36:58
Right?
36:58
And like he was, he used to work for this evil empire, which was terrible for him.
37:05
And he put so much work into being, into being like into, like rising
37:09
up in the ranks in this military, you know, and being the perfect spy.
37:14
But he was realizing, like, it made him feel terrible and it wasn't him.
37:18
Like it wasn't him, you know, and I don't like as silly as it sounds, I do
37:21
think that is kind of what it's like to be trans, because you're trying to fit
37:26
in for so long and repressing stuff, and then eventually you're just like, nope,
37:31
this doesn't this cannot happen anymore.
37:35
And you step out of comfort and into like the total unknown.
37:41
But like, you're you're you're seeking happiness, you know, and
37:44
that's kind of like his thing.
37:48
And so he's like, I can sort of explore transness through him.
37:55
And then Nora, the other character I play, she's like the only female
37:58
character I played for a while.
38:01
And she, I would say she is like almost a deliberate self-insert in ways.
38:06
Because I very much use her as a way to process trauma.
38:11
And she is a little bit of like a, an avatar of myself as a child.
38:18
A little bit, because like, like I mentioned, doing ballet as a child.
38:24
And that was pretty traumatic for me because, you know, ballet is
38:30
often pretty traumatic for people.
38:33
And it was very much for me because, like, my teacher was
38:38
generally pretty abusive, and
38:43
didn't really allow for any sort of actual expression, and was mean to
38:50
people, which is like, I don't even understand how that like, you're literally
38:55
working with children, you can't be just randomly mean, but you can apparently.
39:02
And so that was very damaging to me.
39:06
And I actually ended up with an eating disorder because
39:09
of it, which was not great.
39:13
And I also think that dysphoria played a huge part in my eating disorder,
39:17
because, like, when I look back to, like, what I was like, what I really
39:23
hated about my body, it's like similar things to what I don't like now.
39:28
I just think about it in a different way, you know?
39:31
And like, I just I didn't like the parts of my body that made it look feminine.
39:34
And I hated going through puberty because it was like body horror for
39:40
me, you know, and I didn't realize why, but it was like, oh my God.
39:44
Like, this is like, something's so wrong with this, you know?
39:49
And so I sort of took that out on myself, I guess, kind of, and, tried to find a
39:56
way to make myself feel better, and try and find a way to, like, fix my body.
40:03
And obviously my eating disorder didn't work for that, because
40:06
it never really does for anyone.
40:09
But I'm much healthier now.
40:11
But anyway, ballet was, like, pretty damaging for me.
40:15
And like Nora, she lives in, like, an evil cult.
40:18
She's actually out of the cult now, which is good, but, she she's
40:22
from a cult, and she has, like, an adoptive father who sucks.
40:29
And she kind of tries to, like, like a monk in DND is like a sort
40:34
of character who, like, basically a martial artist, I guess.
40:38
And, she's
40:41
really trained her body to the extent, like to, like, like,
40:45
super high extents and everything.
40:47
And that's kind of what I did, you know, and, like, trying to prove
40:50
yourself and trying to, like, you know, give yourself value because you
40:55
feel like you lack value inherently.
40:56
I don't know, that's like sort of something that's like
40:59
her part of her character.
41:02
And that's definitely also something that I relate to a lot.
41:05
So like, I sort of use her as a way to process that.
41:11
And it sounds silly because DND like just like a role-playing game, you know.
41:14
But like, I very much it has a very special place in my heart.
41:20
And all of my characters are very much avatars of myself in ways, so, yeah.
41:29
Yeah.
41:29
That's cool.
41:30
I like that.
41:30
Makes sense.
41:31
I feel like a lot of people do that with their characters.
41:33
Yeah.
41:33
Yeah, I think so.
41:35
Yeah.
41:36
I think that's all the questions I had.
41:38
Did you have anything else you wanted to talk about?
41:42
I don't think so.
41:44
I mean, like, I could talk about my parents, but I don't
41:47
really have to, you know.
41:49
That.
41:50
It's up to you.
41:52
I mean.
41:54
It's kind of a tale as old as time, right?
41:56
Like most trans people, I think, have some issues with their parents.
42:00
I don't think all of them are quite as bad as mine.
42:03
But a lot of them are very much worse than mine.
42:06
So,
42:09
I don't know.
42:09
Yeah, I don't I don't have much to say about it.
42:11
I guess,
42:13
it does get better, you know, if you don't back down and you keep trying
42:18
to advocate for yourself and making sure and like trying to actually push
42:22
your parents to accept you, because not for everyone, but for many people,
42:27
eventually they will realize that they at least have to be somewhat courteous
42:33
to you if they're still going to want to have a relationship with you.
42:38
But that isn't true for everyone, sadly, because some people's
42:41
parents never realized that.
42:45
But yeah.
42:47
Anyway.
42:47
Yeah.
42:48
Yeah.
42:49
Would that maybe be your advice to like, future OSU like, future
42:55
queer OSU students like if they're dealing with the same thing?
42:56
Don't even know what I don't even know what my advice would be,
43:02
everyone's situation is so different in that realm.
43:05
You know, like some people, their parents feel weird about it at first, but then
43:09
they'll like, sort of quick, like do their own research and understand or some, some
43:14
people's parents will never understand and they'll just things will always be weird.
43:21
My parents are kind of in the middle of that.
43:25
I guess I would say.
43:27
Yeah.
43:28
Don't like let don't let like people's doubting get to you because for a while
43:36
I very much let that happen and was even after I was like feeling super
43:40
comfortable with my gender, I would still have like these doubting thoughts
43:44
and stuff that were like, not at all my own, but just like feeling like I like
43:51
I was feeling bad about being trans, and I still have a lot of shame about being
43:55
trans, but mostly because of my parents.
44:00
And I would say just like, yeah, I guess my advice would be is just don't try
44:06
not to let that get, get through to you.
44:11
Because it can really suck to feel like you do love yourself and you do
44:15
understand yourself, but you still just can't feel totally happy about being
44:19
trans because you're worried about what other people think about you.
44:22
You can't really be worrying about that, especially not when you're
44:24
trans, because there's always going to be people who are weird about you.
44:29
So yeah.
44:32
All right.
44:33
Well, anything else?
44:35
Yes.
44:36
I don't I don't think so.
44:37
Okay.
44:38
Sorry.
44:38
I was sort of all over the place.
44:39
No.
44:40
You're fine.
44:41
It was good.
44:42
A lot of people do it like that, so it's whatever.
44:44
All right, well, thank you for the interview.
44:46
Yeah.
44:47
Thank you so much.
