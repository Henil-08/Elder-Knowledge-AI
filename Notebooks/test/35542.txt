00:00
Okay.
00:01
Today is February 10th, 2024.
00:04
I'm here with Sage Briddon, over zoom.
00:08
And I'm in Corvallis.
00:09
Where are you today?
00:12
Corvallis.
00:12
Corvallis too, amazing.
00:13
It's pronounced "Brid-don".
00:15
All right.
00:16
Good to know.
00:16
I should have asked that before.
00:17
Okay.
00:20
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as a part of my
00:24
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:27
Okay.
00:27
Welcome to the interview.
00:29
Good afternoon!
00:31
Good afternoon.
00:33
Okay.
00:33
Okay, let's start with the basics.
00:35
Do you just want to repeat for the, for the recording?
00:39
How you identify and what your pronouns are?
00:45
Identity.
00:49
I guess the most accurate label would be like genderqueer or just queer.
00:56
But, like, I've got a non-binary sticker on my cane, so,
01:01
like, that's like the public.
01:04
It's like the trench coat of identity.
01:07
And then if you open it up, it's like three possums inside of it.
01:12
And the three possums are genderqueer, queer...
01:16
Genderfluid, genderqueer, like agender.
01:20
Just like there's a bunch of frogs and the sleeves that are the day to day.
01:25
Amazing.
01:26
So
01:28
do you, like, kind of like change how you identify depending on the day.
01:35
[Sage nods yes] Yeah, okay.
01:36
It's like...
01:38
What are you feeling like today?
01:43
Kind of like "none gender with left dude."
01:48
I can respect that.
01:49
That's a good way to do it.
01:50
The button up.
01:52
I like it.
01:52
It kind of looks like a lab coat.
01:54
It is a lab coat.
01:55
Amazing!
01:57
What's your major?
01:59
Natural resources.
02:01
Do you work in a lab?
02:02
No.
02:03
No, just felt like the lab coat.
02:05
I can respect it.
02:07
Okay.
02:09
So let's start at the beginning.
02:12
When
02:15
I was a boy...
02:16
No, literally, like, for your, like, surrounding your childhood, like, were
02:22
there any experiences that you thought were pretty formative to your gender or
02:26
like, what activities were involved in?
02:28
Yeah.
02:29
Anything like that.
02:30
I was the child that no one wanted to play with.
02:33
So I wasn't really involved in any of the, like, formative gender playing.
02:40
Like, I didn't play house or anything, like ball.
02:45
I was just up in the corner by the trees, kicking leaves into piles.
02:52
Oh, no.
02:56
So that kind of little natural resources major a little bit in your childhood?
03:02
[Sage
03:04
nods yes] Interesting.
03:05
So you didn't do any sports then?
03:07
Did you do any other extracurriculars, like in high school or anything?
03:11
I didn't have time for extracurriculars.
03:13
I was just trying to survive.
03:15
Oh, survive?
03:19
Survive high school.
03:20
Cause both my parents are teachers and both my grandparents are retired
03:26
teachers, my maternal grandparents.
03:30
So I was just like, trying to keep my grades up.
03:38
And so, extracurriculars *shakes head no.*
03:42
Okay.
03:48
Was school kind of hard for you?
03:50
Oh, definitely.
03:52
I got that autism.
03:54
So.
03:55
Yeah.
03:56
All right.
03:58
Oh,
04:01
when did you start to kind of, like, start to question your gender, I guess.
04:06
I'd say like 2019.
04:13
Like, the earliest I can.
04:16
I remember thinking about it was when I was in Clark College up in Washington.
04:23
And there was this person in one of my classes that I didn't
04:27
quite know the gender of.
04:29
So I'm just like, okay, I'm going to find out if they're boy or girl.
04:34
So I am going to introduce myself but I'm going to introduce myself as she/they.
04:41
And then I'll be safe.
04:43
I'll be a safe person and they can tell me and then I'll know the gender secret.
04:48
So.
04:55
So that's where it started.
04:57
Yeah.
04:57
Did it work?
04:58
Did they tell you?
04:59
Yes.
05:00
It was like he/him.
05:04
All right.
05:06
I found the gender secret.
05:08
Found the gender secret.
05:10
So.
05:13
So it kind of started with seeing other people be queer in some way, and
05:18
then you're like, hmm I can do that.
05:21
Or it kind of, like, brought up something for you.
05:23
Or you, like, maybe, like what I am now isn't right for me?
05:29
Could you repeat that question, please?
05:31
Yeah.
05:32
Did you think that seeing someone else be, like, openly queer?
05:37
Was it, like, more of a, oh, "I can do that kind of thing," or more
05:41
of, like, an internal, "like maybe something isn't like, right with how I'm
05:48
currently identifying" kind of thing.
05:49
It was more like a huh, I didn't know that could be a thing.
05:54
Interesting.
05:56
It's one time in high school, two my buddies were like playing around, and
06:04
one of them was like "they're sitting on me!" and I was like, there's only
06:08
one person on you and there's just like, no, the guy goes by he/they pronouns
06:14
and I'm just like, ah, that's a thing?
06:19
Interesting.
06:20
Yeah.
06:22
I forgot to-
06:22
Neutral pronouns were a thing before then.
06:25
When, like, where did you grow up?
06:28
Camas, Washington.
06:30
It's up by Vancouver.
06:32
And when did you graduate high school?
06:35
2020.
06:37
2020. Okay.
06:38
The year of the plague.
06:41
Me too.
06:41
I actually graduated in 2020, too.
06:44
Graduated over zoom.
06:46
I did too.
06:49
It's a good time.
06:50
Okay.
06:51
I'm thinking where to take this.
06:56
Okay, so you graduate over zoom, right?
06:58
Do you think that that had anything to do with it?
07:02
Like, maybe like seeing that people be, like, openly queer and
07:06
then you just kind of got, like, shoved into lockdown and like.
07:10
Definitely,
07:13
it was just like, okay, I can't control the state of the world,
07:21
but I can control my pronouns.
07:24
It's
07:28
true.
07:31
Big brain.
07:32
Big brain.
07:33
So how?
07:36
How did you start to identify?
07:38
She/they?
07:40
It started out she/they and then like they/them and then
07:48
like I don't really care.
07:52
You know, and now it's just like, I don't care, but just like, not, not cis.
08:03
So did you have any role models as a kid, whether that was like
08:07
a queer role model or non queer?
08:10
Whatever works.
08:12
Like any kind of role model?
08:14
Yeah.
08:15
I'm glad you asked.
08:16
I got his book on my bookshelf.
08:19
Jeremy Wade.
08:21
"River Monsters."
08:24
It was like the show about fishing, and I watched it religiously as a child.
08:31
And did.
08:32
Is that what, like, let you get into natural resources?
08:36
Like, I was that kid that did not play with dolls.
08:40
I played with little plastic animals.
08:44
And every time I played, they ended up, like, getting revenge on humans.
08:51
Nice, that's awesome actually.
08:55
Yeah, it's just like, oh, the mean poachers have the animals.
09:00
The animals kill.
09:04
I mean, at least you recognize that a young age that like, you
09:08
know, animals, we shouldn't really be treating them the way we are.
09:14
It's true.
09:15
Okay.
09:17
Thing was, I played those games the most in therapy.
09:22
Oh.
09:23
So, like, therapist took a lot of notes.
09:27
Yeah.
09:30
That's funny.
09:31
Okay.
09:32
So, you, okay.
09:33
So,
09:38
you mentioned you, like, kind of saw that person and like, oh, you can do that.
09:42
So, in what ways did you start to explore your gender besides
09:45
just changing your pronouns?
09:47
I changed up my hair.
09:48
It used to be like, down to here, and then I cut off into, like, bob.
09:56
And then one day I was just like, if I don't get this hair off of
09:59
my neck, I'm going to implode.
10:01
So I just [hand gesture of buzzing head] . And I got home that day and my
10:05
grandma was just like, what possessed you?
10:10
Just like, what possessed me?
10:16
Is autism.
10:21
So like then I figured out the like name thing and, you know, chose Sage
10:28
because it's got a lot of meaning.
10:30
Like sage means wisdom.
10:34
Wisdom's a value I really try to emulate.
10:38
Plus, it's got ties to one of my special interests, which is Journey to the West.
10:44
What's that?
10:46
It's a Chinese classic book.
10:49
And it got like, it's a big media thing, like.
10:57
And one of the characters, Sun Wukong, one of his titles is "Great Sage Equal
11:02
to Heaven." And he's one of my favorites.
11:05
So plus it relates to a plant that I saw a lot in my first field work.
11:11
So I chose it originally because like, oh, it means wisdom, I like wisdom,
11:17
and then now it's got like multi-layer.
11:21
That's cool.
11:22
Where was your field work at?
11:26
Down in the Klamath Basin.
11:29
I actually did it last summer.
11:33
It was very fun.
11:34
I got to see a lot of birds.
11:40
That's cool.
11:41
Love a good bird.
11:43
And lots of sage there too?
11:47
[Sage does a finger pointing gesture under their chin] Okay.
11:53
This was my textbook for that.
11:56
That's cool.
11:57
Sagebrush Country.
11:59
I've got my bookshelf behind me.
12:01
I can see.
12:04
Is a book your object?
12:06
Or did you bring something else for your object?
12:08
Actually, I do not have a book as an object.
12:13
I have clothes as an object.
12:17
So first off, I got this lovely skirt.
12:23
You know.
12:24
Lovely.
12:25
Yeah.
12:25
You know, it's a good texture.
12:28
And when I saw it, I was just like, oh, this is great.
12:32
This is going to fit well.
12:34
You know, this is going to fit well.
12:37
I could use more skirts in my closet, and it is too small on me,
12:42
so I can't wear it comfortably.
12:45
So it just sits in my closet until I can figure out how to mend it to fit me.
12:53
And then this is a historic vest that my dad gave to me.
13:01
And, you know, again, it looks comfy.
13:03
You know, it's an okay texture, you know, comfy, pockets, but it's too big,
13:11
so again I can't wear it comfortably.
13:14
And that's kind of like how masculinity versus femininity
13:18
feels like if I wear femininity it's just like, owe, that pinches.
13:25
But if I wear masculinity, it's just like, this is going to fall off sometime.
13:30
It's just a matter of when.
13:35
But like if I wear something like my lab coat, then it fits perfectly.
13:41
Like it's comfy.
13:42
I've worn it before, I like it.
13:45
So that's kind of like easy.
13:49
I also did a bit of a painting.
13:53
It's just, oh, it's on my lap.
13:58
It kind of illustrates it, like, got blue.
14:04
Kind of traditionally masc colors over there, you know, pretty cool.
14:10
Got like pinks, oranges, traditionally femme colors over there.
14:17
And then you got this weird green thing in the middle, and that's me.
14:23
That's cool.
14:24
Yes.
14:26
I loved your analogy for the clothes.
14:30
That's really original.
14:31
Thanks, put a lot an effort into it.
14:32
Also, this skirt is such a good texture.
14:36
Cannot wear it yet.
14:38
Not comfortably at least.
14:40
Yeah.
14:41
Take some wiggling.
14:47
So you, have you worn either of these items out or do you like put them on and
14:53
you're like, this isn't happening today.
14:56
I put them on and then it's like, oh no, not happening.
15:03
Because like, I'm scared to get this one dirty because, like, it's historic.
15:08
Yeah.
15:09
It's beautiful and it's white.
15:10
So it is like-
15:11
Just figured out that there's like a tie in the back, so I'm gonna be
15:16
trying that out, but like this one.
15:21
It takes wiggling.
15:22
So,
15:25
I can put it on.
15:26
I can wear it, but it's going to pinch and it's not going to
15:29
feel great around the waist.
15:33
So like, I just stick with, like, cargo pants slash shorts, t-shirts, tank tops.
15:40
I've got a really good, like tank top I like.
15:44
It's very gender.
15:45
It's got like, Vincent van Gogh's sunflower painting on it.
15:50
Nice.
15:51
Love it.
15:52
So do you pick your clothes more for comfort rather than, like, expression?
15:57
Bingo.
15:58
Bingo.
15:59
Like sometimes I'll just like,
16:03
feel very masc, so I'll put on like suspenders, button ups, slacks, you
16:09
know, really dressed to the nines.
16:12
Sometimes I'll feel fem and I'll just wear, like, a pretty dress.
16:16
And then normally I just wear cargo pants.
16:19
Or if I'm having a bad knee pain day, I'll wear a skirt because
16:23
it's easier to get the braces on.
16:28
And like if I'm wearing a skirt, then on a masc day it's just like,
16:35
yes I'm a dude, I'm wearing a skirt.
16:38
I'm not wearing it to look girly.
16:40
I'm wearing it so I don't have to wiggle my knee braces off
16:43
and on under the pant legs.
16:46
Please do not perceive
16:50
me.
16:52
Yeah.
16:53
You mentioned okay.
16:53
So you mentioned that the skirt kind of represents the femininity
16:58
and that it's like pinching.
16:59
It's too tight.
17:00
So do you think I'm kind of wondering, like what you think about
17:04
femininity as like a whole in society.
17:08
Do you think it's kind of, like, restrictive?
17:10
Definitely.
17:13
Like, have you seen the stuff they still sell in stores?
17:17
Just like,
17:22
[disgusted sounds] like, bro.
17:23
Why is this jacket pre-ripped?
17:25
Why are these jeans cut in-?
17:28
Do
17:32
you need to mend them?
17:33
I
17:37
mend a lot of my clothes myself.
17:40
It's because, like, I cannot stand having holes in clothes.
17:43
And I go out and I see all these, like, trendy clothes, and it's just like.
17:48
And that is specifically in the feminine section.
17:57
Like no one sees a dude with ripped jeans and goes, oh, he's so trendy.
18:04
They go like,
18:07
Well.
18:09
That guy's pants are ripped.
18:11
Wonder what happened to him.
18:14
It's true.
18:19
Like masc clothes.
18:21
They just fit better.
18:26
Like, they're more comfortable.
18:27
They're more utility focused.
18:32
And I think that's important not just for like, my comfort, but what I do
18:39
on a day to day basis because, like, I carry a lot around a lot of stuff,
18:45
and sometimes I just want to put them in pockets and not in my backpack.
18:50
Like, if I got pockets, I can put rocks in there.
18:53
I can put moss in there like, but if I go for like a skirt, then there's no pockets.
19:02
I can't put anything in there.
19:06
So, like, it's pretty.
19:07
But is it useful?
19:11
I had a point, so I don't know where it was going.
19:14
I feel like it makes sense.
19:19
I, I mean, you mentioned the masculine clothes as, like the metaphor for being
19:26
too big, like it's going to fall off.
19:28
Can you...
19:28
Like it doesn't quite fit, but, like, it kind of fits.
19:34
Like, but it's like falling off.
19:36
It doesn't fit great.
19:40
I'm like,
19:45
it fits my dad better than
19:52
me.
19:52
Do you think that for masc clothes in general or just that one specific vest.
19:57
That one.
19:58
That one.
19:59
Okay.
19:59
I just chose it for the metaphor because it's like big, and I only own two
20:08
vests.
20:08
Including that one.
20:09
The other one's like slightly too small, but I wear it anyway
20:13
because I love it so much.
20:15
It's got like patches on it.
20:17
Safety pins.
20:19
It looks so pretty.
20:21
I think I might have it over here.
20:23
That's cool.
20:24
Okay.
20:28
Go grab it.
20:28
Found it.
20:32
What
20:35
did I just sit on?
20:42
Oh, very cool.
20:44
Like that's good.
20:48
Like, is it functional?
20:49
Not really.
20:50
But is it pretty?
20:52
Absolutely.
20:53
Does it have meaning to me?
20:54
Yeah.
20:55
But like.
20:58
This is kind of more like form over function.
21:05
I'm a very utilitarian person.
21:10
Except for when it comes to that vest.
21:12
Except for when it comes to this vest.
21:14
And even this one, I can put like a pen in this pocket, I
21:17
can, I can put patches on it.
21:22
I got Friends of the Willamette Valley patch on it.
21:27
It's a little bird.
21:29
Plus I got it at my first pride parade.
21:33
There was a dude selling clothing out of his car trunk, and I was just like,
21:39
ooo.
21:40
It's free fashion.
21:42
That's cool.
21:43
I mean, so even if you do say you go for more function over form that still
21:49
has like special memories to you.
21:50
So, it kind of does serve a function of you keeping it.
21:54
Yeah.
21:54
Plus, since it's kind of small, it can correct my posture, which
21:59
is important because I slouch.
22:01
Me too, me too.
22:04
It's the curse, the curse.
22:07
It's true.
22:08
Okay.
22:12
So you mentioned you went to Pride.
22:15
Did you want to speak more on that?
22:16
Or maybe if there's any other events.
22:18
I went there once.
22:19
You want there once?
22:21
Only once.
22:21
So far.
22:23
What was it like?
22:26
It's pretty cool, you know?
22:28
Lots of flags.
22:30
There's this one person there.
22:32
Oh my god,
22:37
they had like Sharpie-on facial hair and just like a button up that was like
22:44
partially undone down to their cleavage.
22:49
Nice.
22:51
I've never been to a pride parade, but I assume that's probably
22:53
something you'd see there.
22:55
Yeah, it's pretty cool, but just, like, kind of loud.
22:59
It's like any social gathering.
23:01
It's true.
23:06
Do you go to social gatherings a lot?
23:09
Not often.
23:10
Not often.
23:11
How do you usually like to dress up for those?
23:15
Or like, how do you like to present yourself for those?
23:20
Kind of like "is that guy or girl?" "I don't know." "Okay."
23:28
It's like neutral.
23:32
Like, when I was working in a school district, I wore, like, black, buttoned
23:39
up black slacks, suspenders, and this little, like, first grade girl calls
23:44
me over and she goes, "are you a boy or a girl?" And I went, "that's a
23:49
good question." And I walked away.
23:53
Classic kid question.
23:55
Yeah.
23:57
Two kids have asked me that, and I was like, that's a good question.
24:03
And
24:07
then you just walk away.
24:07
And I think that's an answer in and of itself.
24:09
Yeah.
24:14
Gender.
24:14
I do not care for it.
24:16
Give me a gander.
24:18
Give me a good bird.
24:21
So, what is euphoric to you when it comes to your gender?
24:27
Is it like achieving that state of neutrality that you look for?
24:30
Oh.
24:30
I gave-I made a list.
24:33
Amazing.
24:34
Okay.
24:36
Things that are gender: like wearing shorts.
24:41
Like.
24:42
Especially with pockets.
24:44
Like lab coats, hoodies, tank tops, high necklines.
24:51
Like being perceived as a cryptid, but in like a slightly masc way, you
24:59
know, like masc-neutral and then like,
25:07
it's just like gender in general, just like I don't care for it.
25:17
And like.
25:20
What was the question?
25:22
It was, what is euphoric to you?
25:25
But I guess you could also talk about what is dysphoric to you.
25:28
Okay.
25:29
Euphoria.
25:33
Being perceived as neutral.
25:38
I'm just like neutral or like, slightly gender.
25:44
But like, more masculine.
25:46
If that makes sense.
25:49
Just like.
25:52
Kind of, neutral colors as well, like greens?
25:59
A-plus.
26:00
Grays?
26:00
A-plus.
26:01
Blacks?
26:02
They nice.
26:06
Yellows?
26:06
I'll wear them.
26:07
Pinks?
26:08
Cool.
26:08
Blues?
26:09
Cool.
26:10
But just like vibrant colors, ew,
26:17
it's like crypsis in a way.
26:21
Like.
26:23
If I was in a different environment, then I would like wearing vibrant
26:30
colors, because in that vibrant, in that different environment, I
26:37
would be more comfortable in them.
26:41
But since I'm in this environment, I like neutrals more.
26:46
That's a biology metaphor [dabs]
26:50
. You said "crypsis"?
26:52
Yeah.
26:53
How do you spell that?
26:55
Hang on.
26:58
C r y p s i s. This is basically a fancy word for natural camouflage.
27:11
Okay.
27:12
Like it's how parrots in the tropics have all these bright colors.
27:16
And then shorebirds are just universally, like, tan and gray.
27:21
Yeah.
27:22
So it's just like the animal is fitted to their environment kind of thing.
27:26
Exactly.
27:27
Okay.
27:28
That's cool.
27:28
I've never heard of that.
27:29
Yeah, I guess it makes sense.
27:34
My cat's meowing.
27:35
Sorry if you can hear that.
27:36
Oh a kitty!
27:40
What is your cat's name?
27:41
My cat's name is Chirp.
27:44
I love that so much.
27:45
I know the shelter named for that.
27:47
And she kind of chirps like a bird.
27:48
So we're like all right it stays.
27:55
Okay.
27:55
Are there any other significant influences on your gender?
28:01
I don't know if you're religious, but this could be like your religion.
28:03
Maybe the type of job you have, what location you're in, where you were raised?
28:08
I
28:12
think something that like influenced my fashion sense, like historically
28:18
was "River Monsters," because Jeremy Wade just wears like these utilitarian
28:22
type things, just like neutral dark colors, just like, what a look.
28:34
Religion wise?
28:36
Not really.
28:39
But, like, historically.
28:44
My grandma was, like, a really big Methodist-type person.
28:52
Yeah, Methodist.
28:54
So, when I was, ugh, I just remembered!
29:01
We were in the car once, going to pizza.
29:04
It was me and my grandma, and she just comes out of the blue
29:07
and goes, "I noticed you've been dressing more like a boy lately."
29:14
The fear I felt in that moment.
29:17
And she's just like, "are you a boy now?" And I'm just like, "not really.
29:23
I'm kind of in between." And she's like, "oh, okay." Okay.
29:26
And I'm just like.
29:30
But what was that fear from?
29:32
Was it from having to explain or like not being accepted?
29:36
Kind of both.
29:37
But she's getting really good at it.
29:39
Like, she's using my preferred name and everything.
29:42
That's sweet.
29:44
And my [indistinguishable, most likely "papa"] was just like, oh, are you
29:46
planning on going on testosterone?
29:49
And I'm like, not really.
29:50
He's like, oh, okay.
29:53
That's nice that they were like trying to like, you know,
29:57
discuss with you about it though.
29:59
And like, maybe they probably did some research to learn that too.
30:02
It's so sweet.
30:03
That's very cute.
30:05
Just like.
30:09
Yeah?
30:10
What?
30:12
You said, "just like" I was just wondering if you had anything else to add.
30:16
I might have, but I forgot.
30:17
Okay.
30:18
That's okay.
30:19
So, were, you mentioned your grandparents, right.
30:23
Do you think they had any sort of... are they a good role model to you, maybe,
30:28
or like a good, like, parental figure?
30:31
Definitely.
30:32
Yeah, why do you say that?
30:35
He's just like a dude.
30:39
He is just like a guy.
30:40
And I love him so much.
30:42
He is a retired science teacher, and he is just very
30:50
kind and accepting.
30:53
And I aspire to be like him.
30:59
It's just.
31:01
Why be mad when you could be accepting?
31:05
You know.
31:06
It's true.
31:10
There is an airplane going overhead and... I can hear it.
31:15
We can just,
31:21
wait for it to pass.
31:23
Okay.
31:24
It's going.
31:28
It's gone.
31:31
So did you ever come out, or did you just just kind of start, you know, presenting
31:37
the way you wanted to, and you're like, if they figure it out, they figure it out.
31:42
It was like that with the grandparents.
31:43
And then I'm with my mom.
31:45
I'm just like, hey, mom, I think I might be like, nonbinary.
31:48
And she's just like, that's not really a real thing.
31:51
Like, did you have like a historical thing about it?
31:57
And I'm just like, and she just went, or is this like a way of coping with
32:03
your stress and I'm like, maybe, but, like, it doesn't negate it.
32:12
Like, do I have stress?
32:17
Yes.
32:20
But does that directly correlate to gender?
32:24
No.
32:25
Correlation does not equal causation, mother.
32:28
But she's gotten better about it.
32:32
That's good.
32:35
Yeah.
32:35
That's interesting.
32:37
I also have like a lot of stress and anxiety and a lot
32:43
of, you know, stuff going on.
32:46
And I'm also, like, non-binary.
32:49
And I've always wondered if it was because of all that that I like,
32:54
started to identify this way.
32:56
But I kind of I like your perspective on it.
32:59
Like maybe it was, but it doesn't change the fact that it's how I feel.
33:04
Yeah, like.
33:07
Gender feels bad.
33:09
It's like if someone made me eat the odd brussels sprouts.
33:15
Wrong.
33:16
Oh.
33:18
Like, if you try to put me into a role that I do not want to be in, it will
33:24
feel bad no matter what the situation is.
33:28
But like.
33:30
Specifically, like gender.
33:32
It's just like, I don't care for it.
33:34
Please get that out.
33:35
[Sage does a shooing motion with their hand] That's not it.
33:39
That's not good, go.
33:47
This is a, like a, whatever.
33:50
So this is a question that leads into the next question.
33:52
Do you use social media or, like, any internet of things.
33:57
Too much social media.
33:59
Too much.
34:00
Do you think that social media has impacted your gender in any way?
34:05
Maybe.
34:07
Like.
34:09
A lot of the people I interact with are, just in some capacity, queer.
34:16
I just realized I'm drawing a turkey.
34:19
You just realized, it's true.
34:22
It just got, like, the feather style.
34:29
What was I saying?
34:29
Oh, yeah.
34:31
So, like a lot of the people I follow online are like queer in some capacity.
34:41
So maybe it influenced, like, the fitting in aspect.
34:47
Yeah.
34:48
But, like, at the same time.
34:52
Probably not all of it.
34:57
Does that make sense?
34:58
Yeah, that makes sense.
35:00
So, you know.
35:04
Maybe not really impacted, but you still like, interacted
35:06
with like online queer spaces.
35:10
Yeah.
35:10
Were they pretty positive for you?
35:12
Yeah.
35:13
That's good.
35:14
And one of my buddies is a trans dude.
35:17
He's, that guy's a character.
35:18
Like he
35:29
influenced me to like, do what I like, even if it weirds people out.
35:38
I have stories about that man.
35:45
That's a good perspective to have, is to like, do what's comfortable to you.
35:51
Did you like I mean, did you have any trouble like getting
35:54
over that, need to try to fit in?
36:00
Yeah.
36:01
It's just sometimes I'll think like, oh, I should present like this because
36:07
that's how people want to see me.
36:09
But then I think if I present like that, I will throw up in my mouth a little.
36:14
I will not do that.
36:17
And then I don't do that because I don't want to throw up in my mouth a little.
36:21
Yeah.
36:25
It's about being comfortable in life.
36:31
Because if you're not being true to yourself, then what are you doing?
36:38
Like we're here for a good time.
36:40
Not a long time.
36:44
Human lifespans are too short
36:48
to do what feels wrong.
36:55
This week on Sage Wisdom with Sage.
36:58
Sage
37:03
wisdom.
37:06
The number of times I've gotten that joke from, like, dudes.
37:12
Like middle aged white dudes.
37:15
Twice.
37:16
But just like something you say and they're like, wow,
37:18
that was like sage wisdom.
37:19
No, they saw my nametag when I was working and they're like,
37:23
how do you have any sage advice?
37:25
"Heheh" Just like.
37:28
Yeah.
37:33
Oh, beautiful.
37:36
Turkey.
37:37
Turkey.
37:38
Thank you.
37:42
Birds.
37:46
I have bigger things to worry about than like figuring out
37:50
the specificity of gender.
37:52
Like I used to worry about it when I was first figuring it out.
37:56
Like I was just like, oh, I've got to be in this little box.
37:59
But like, no, no, sweetie, calm down.
38:03
Life's too short for that.
38:06
Yeah.
38:06
You don't have to go in the box.
38:07
You can be in the box if you want, but you don't always have to be in the.
38:17
I am noticing that I talk, a lot of metaphors.
38:22
It's good.
38:23
I mean, they're nice, I like them.
38:25
Ah, thanks.
38:28
I'm really bad at making up metaphors, so I like it when other people do it.
38:33
[pause]
38:39
Okay.
38:40
So you kind of mentioned that you get your inspiration for your gender
38:45
expression from River Monsters, right?
38:48
So what are what are like your goals in your mind of, like how your expression
38:55
would you want your expression to be?
38:55
I guess I want people to look at me and be like, I don't know what gender
39:01
that person is, but I know they probably just came from the woods.
39:06
Cryptid.
39:06
Or,
39:09
I want people to look at me and think, what?
39:13
Instead of what are their pronouns?
39:19
Like, I'm going for mad scientist.
39:24
Then it works.
39:25
You already got the lab jacket to start.
39:27
I do.
39:28
It's true.
39:29
Okay.
39:30
Kind of along the same vein, when have you felt most at home in your body?
39:37
When I'm out in the woods or, like, out in the wilderness, away from everything.
39:43
Just like.
39:46
Calm.
39:48
There's birds and like no stress.
39:54
And no joint pain.
39:57
Why does being out in the woods of your joint pain?
40:00
Or is that just like an additional thing?
40:02
That's an additional thing.
40:03
Okay.
40:06
It's like the woods have magic healing abilities.
40:09
They do after you eat the mushrooms!
40:11
Oh!
40:13
No, no, don't eat mushrooms out of the woods-eat mushrooms.
40:17
Well, but look, if I'm out somewhere, nature and there's no
40:25
pain, then I feel comfortable.
40:28
I feel safe.
40:29
I can focus on being alive rather than just like surviving.
40:40
And like that's important to me because I want to live.
40:43
I just I don't just want to be, like, clinging to life, like
40:53
some half-frozen cricket.
41:00
What do you think it is about being out in the woods that creates that sort
41:04
of space for you to feel like that?
41:08
I read this really cool book that was-hang on-said that being
41:17
out in the woods actually helps with a lot of mental issues.
41:22
So I think that has a lot to do with it.
41:33
I'll try to
41:38
focus more, I'm so sorry.
41:38
No you're good.
41:42
It gives me like freedom from like being put in one kind of
41:50
cage of society, you know, like society puts you in like all these little
41:56
packages like feminine, masculine, other.
42:02
But the woods, they don't care.
42:05
If you die out there, they're not going to put like an obituary on your headstone.
42:10
They're not going to be like, oh, she, they, he.
42:14
They're just going to be like, oh another one, okay.
42:20
And I find that comforting because if the woods don't care, you can just be
42:26
out there rather than be something.
42:32
Does that make sense?
42:33
Yeah.
42:34
No it does.
42:35
It's like, I mean you just mentioned being buried, like if you're in the woods, like
42:40
you'll decompose the same as anybody else.
42:44
Exactly, there won't be like any embalming fluid.
42:48
Like there won't be someone to see your corpse and judge it, just like
42:53
you'll be out in the woods decomposing.
42:57
This is a little bit of a tangent, but do you have a preferred way
43:00
you would like to be buried?
43:02
I would love to feed the condors.
43:04
Condors
43:05
Just leave me out for the birds of prey to eat, like sky burial.
43:12
That's so cool.
43:13
Yeah, I actually have a book on condors.
43:20
Somewhere in here,
43:24
found it.
43:25
Beautiful,
43:29
one giant bird.
43:31
They are giant.
43:34
Look at that guy.
43:37
Yikes.
43:39
It's
43:42
cool way to be buried.
43:44
The amount of bird books is absurd.
43:49
Is that your focus in your major?
43:51
Or just, like, a special interest?
43:53
Interest.
43:55
That's cool.
43:56
I have.
43:57
I don't even know how many field guides I've got right now.
44:02
But I got a lot of them.
44:06
Okay.
44:07
One of the last questions I have, actually.
44:09
Well, this is like a set of questions, but.
44:11
So you go to OSU, right?
44:13
You're a natural resources major.
44:16
I was wondering if your college experience has influenced your gender in any way.
44:20
It's definitely been like,
44:25
more freeing because, like
44:31
back home, I was just like, I didn't have a lot of social life because,
44:36
you know, lack of walkability.
44:38
But like, here, I can just go out and be my best self and people
44:43
will be like, oh, there goes a guy, there goes a little dude.
44:49
Why is he carrying a trash bag that looks suspiciously heavy?
44:57
Why where you carrying a trash bag that looks-
44:59
Five pounds of English ivy that I pulled off a tree in a parking lot.
45:04
To replant or.
45:06
No, it's an invasive species.
45:08
Really?
45:09
I didn't know that.
45:11
It's, one, like, on par with Himalayan blackberry.
45:16
Like Himalayan blackberry.
45:17
It mainly takes over the countryside.
45:21
English ivy takes over the suburbs.
45:27
That's interesting.
45:28
I've heard of like, kudzu, like in the South.
45:30
Oh that was, hmm, "the vine that ate the South."
45:34
Yeah, I saw that.
45:37
Yeah.
45:37
I saw this map of like kudzu in the US.
45:40
And there is actually some of it over in the Pacific Northwest.
45:43
Oh, joy.
45:44
I know, I'm like, they better get rid of that before it takes over.
45:50
Okay.
45:51
Another thing relating to college.
45:53
Do you feel like OSU is a particularly welcoming environment for people?
45:59
Pretty good, like the professors are nice,
46:05
you know.
46:05
It's pretty cool.
46:09
Everyone's being nice.
46:12
No one's just like, oh, you use neutral pronouns?
46:15
That's kind of concerning.
46:16
Get help.
46:17
Just like I can go up [to some-] one and be like, what's up?
46:22
And they're just like, what are your pronouns?
46:26
Because I cannot for the life of me tell.
46:31
That has happened so many times.
46:33
That's awesome.
46:35
Yeah.
46:38
All right.
46:41
Checking over my list of questions.
46:44
You're doing great.
46:46
Thank you.
46:54
Oh.
46:54
I didn't really have any other questions.
46:56
Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that you
46:58
think is particularly pertinent?
47:02
Not really.
47:03
Not really?
47:03
Okay.
