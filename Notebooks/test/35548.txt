00:15
So,
00:23
I think, all I am really looking for at this interview is kind of
00:28
your general immigration story.
00:30
Okay.
00:31
So where do we begin?
00:32
So,
00:35
I
00:38
went to college in India.
00:39
All of my school and college in India in geography and one of the reasons—
00:44
So, let me kind of backup a little bit.
00:47
One of the reasons why I selected geography, as an undergraduate degree,
00:51
is because growing up in India, it’s kind of difficult as a woman.
00:54
You know, everywhere I went I had my dad or brother accompany me, and so
00:58
one of the reasons I took geography, at this particular college, Loreto,
01:01
that I attended in Kolkata where I grew up, was because they had a mandatory
01:07
field trip every year, and so what that meant for me translated into this
01:12
is where you get to go out with your peers and colleagues into kind of the
01:17
field, and you don’t have a chaperone.
01:19
And so, I found that very, sort of, a very liberating idea as a
01:23
young woman growing up in India.
01:25
And so, that was
01:29
my journey into geography.
01:31
And then after graduating geography, I wanted, I really enjoyed the
01:34
subject even though I was not model student of geography.
01:38
I really enjoyed the subject after going through three years of college in India,
01:42
and so I wanted to pursue it further.
01:44
And so, I thought about it and said all right, where should I go?
01:50
So, my mother asked me, she said well, we have a lot of family in Australia,
01:53
we have a lot of family in England.
01:55
Where would you like to go?
01:57
And I said well, who is in America?
02:00
And she said no one in our family.
02:04
I said, okay, [laughs] that’s where I am going [laughs]
02:07
. So, I pretty much then started connecting, looking around to see who I knew who
02:12
had immigrated to the United States, and I had one friend from high school.
02:18
She and her family had immigrated to the U.S. and she serves in the U.S. military,
02:23
and so I got in touch with her, and she lived in Pennsylvania and that, you know,
02:28
I’d like to pursue studies in the U.S. and so she guided me in with a lot of
02:36
programs, you know, things that were in the Pennsylvania area because that’s the
02:40
only connection that I essentially had with someone in the U.S. So I put all my
02:44
paperwork together and got it all going and then since I had a three-year degree
02:49
in India, I could not do a master’s degree in the U.S. because I needed
02:54
sixteen years of college [sic, school] so I essentially enrolled in a small
02:58
university in Pennsylvania [University of Pennsylvania, Millersburg] , which was
02:59
close to my friend’s house, one of the fourteen state schools in Pennsylvania
03:04
to complete that fourth year of college.
03:06
So, I added about a year and a half, but got all my paperwork together
03:10
which is very taxing to put that amount of paperwork together and I
03:18
came in the year two thousand and one, two or three, two weeks before 9/11.
03:25
There wasn’t even Facebook at the time.
03:28
There was technology, as we know it today, was very different
03:32
in two thousand and one.
03:33
So, for you know, we were still using Yahoo accounts and AOL accounts that I
03:39
was emailing from India, you know, email was still functioning, you know, we had
03:43
email going, so but a lot of this had to be, and then you had to essentially wait,
03:48
you know, for hard copies being mailed between India and the United States.
03:54
So, all that aside I managed to get through a lot of that.
03:57
It took about, at least, roughly about a year to get paperwork ready,
04:01
to actually step on the plane to get out of the country and to come here.
04:06
So, yeah, and I essentially came to the U.S. two weeks before
04:11
9/11 happened, and I was in Pennsylvania which was very close to
04:18
the tragedy and also that one plane had gone down in Pennsylvania at the
04:22
time, and so I had come to campus, I was on campus, remember seeing
04:26
some of the horrifying images and
04:32
also for me that was sort of my first encounter with sort of.
04:36
Growing up in India, there is often this misconception that we
04:39
are probably exposed to terrorism.
04:40
We are exposed to a lot of sectarian and religious violence but not terrorism
04:45
at least not for me personally.
04:47
So, this was sort of my first experience with that, and I
04:50
had just come to the country.
04:52
I had no means of communicating with my family other than by email which
04:56
was very slow because they were already receiving all this information
04:59
and they knew a plane went down in Pennsylvania, but I had no phone
05:02
because I was only here for two weeks.
05:04
So, there was no texting, there was no, none of that, and so it was very
05:07
trying, and then I was on campus without any; I use to use the buses,
05:12
public transport, to get around.
05:14
I never had a car, you know, so basically, I was still in my stage of trying
05:18
to figure out my new surroundings.
05:21
So, it was, it was troubling, but eventually I got a hold of folks and.
05:26
But also, living in Pennsylvania at that time, there was a lot of backlash.
05:31
I had some racial slurs yelled out at me while walking to the bus stop.
05:34
It was like, you know, I said I just came here, and I am from India.
05:38
Th-this is nothing to do with me, but you know, we lived in a town
05:42
in Pennsylvania, a town called Ephrata, Pennsylvania, small town.
05:46
I think they had some ties with some KKK and white supremacist
05:50
groups that had come out.
05:51
There was some attacks on, you know, Punjabi, the Sikh, Punjabi people that
05:56
wear turbans and they owned a gas station, a 7-11, that was burned down, and it was
06:01
just like, for me, I was like, what is wrong with people because our typical
06:05
impression about Americans in India is that people here are highly educated.
06:11
Everyone is very well aware of what is happening around the world and this— we
06:15
don’t see this level of ignorance that we see often in India, in our countries.
06:20
We see a certain level of ignorance because we know literacy rates
06:23
are not high and things like that.
06:24
So, I was— kind of very revealing for me to come to the United States and not
06:30
understand why people were attacking Sikhs when the terrorists were from a completely
06:36
different country, and, you know, it— it was— just couldn’t understand it and
06:40
Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan and it’s like the turbans aren’t even the same.
06:45
Like, so, for me, it was very revealing to see that level of ignorance which I did
06:49
not expect to see here, and, of course, over time those ideas have shaped a lot.
06:54
So
06:56
then, I was in Pennsylvania for about a year and a half.
06:58
I did some undergraduate research work in disaster management, emergency management
07:03
kind of stuff with a faculty member at Millersburg University where I attended
07:07
and then he put me on to— finally I was ready to embark on my master’s degree.
07:13
So, he put me on to a couple of faculty members that were at Jacksonville [State]
07:19
University in Alabama, and they had a program there on disaster hazard research.
07:24
And he got me in touch with his peers and colleagues there.
07:27
I applied.
07:28
I got admitted into the university, and so, in two thousand and four, I
07:33
moved from Pennsylvania to Alabama to begin my master’s work with them.
07:37
Barely about six months after reaching Alabama, and again sort of trying to
07:41
figure out where I stood there they got tenure track positions at Oklahoma
07:47
State, a husband and wife, and so they met with me and said Shireen, we know
07:54
you came here to work with us, but we’re getting tenure track positions.
07:57
We’re about to move, and we’d like you to move with us.
08:00
So, I was like great, can you work out some funding?
08:03
Because this place was going to fund me through the master’s or just help,
08:06
you know, assistantships and things.
08:07
And they said yeah, we’ll try to work that out as well.
08:11
So, they did and worked some of that out with Oklahoma State and I got a
08:14
graduate assistantship there and so I essentially tailed them, and they left
08:17
in about August or June or July and I left in August and went to Oklahoma
08:22
State, which is where I did my master’s degree in fire and emergency management
08:28
administration, and then, went on to doing my Ph.D. in geography at Oklahoma State.
08:36
So you did your master’s and your doctorate at Oklahoma—
08:39
At Oklahoma State.
08:40
Orange and black, so not much change in the wardrobe coming to Oregon State.
08:45
Well, that’s good.
08:46
Yeah, and then pretty much graduated.
08:48
Well, I had not graduated when I started applying for jobs.
08:51
I had not defended my Ph.D. yet— applied for jobs, saw this one and then was
08:58
offered the job and then accepted it and came and taught here Spring term 2012 for
09:04
a whole term while still finishing up the Ph.D., teaching two, three classes that
09:09
term so it was a nightmare, but I survived and went back to Oklahoma in the summer
09:14
of 2012 and finished up and graduated.
09:18
[long pause] So, I think one of the only stories that I kinda skipped a
09:23
little bit, but I’m going to backtrack was to one in Pennsylvania where
09:28
after living with my friend for a while, it was a bit inconvenient
09:31
for me to keep traveling by bus.
09:33
I was traveling an hour each way to get to campus from where I lived.
09:36
So, I met this little old lady who was in her 70s, I want to say, on the bus
09:42
when I would transfer and change from the bus from Ephrata to downtown and
09:47
then take the downtown bus to campus.
09:49
I used to meet this little old lady, who was very chatty, and of course, we
09:53
got talking on the bus and she’s like, you know, I live downtown and I rent
09:58
out rooms and I was like, aw, this is such a great opportunity so I was like
10:01
hey, Lillian, I was like, you know, thinking of moving and this would be
10:05
very convenient if I could live and she was like yes, yes and so I rented
10:08
a room with her and we worked that out.
10:10
I rented a room and we were great friends, or so I thought [small laugh] in some
10:16
ways, I mean we interacted well, but I didn’t cook too much, but when I did, she
10:21
did not like the smell of Indian food.
10:23
So, she would end up always leaving the house or said hey, could you
10:26
cook on Sunday and I said yeah sure I’ll cook on Sundays, and I’ll
10:29
leave all the windows open and burn all the candles and it was fine.
10:32
It was like, aw, she’s— she’s a cute old lady, I can— it kinda reminded me
10:35
of my grandma, a little bit, and so— but then there was just one incident,
10:41
I think, which was sort of a turning point for her and for me in some ways.
10:46
She had a really close friend who she knew who was also in the same program
10:50
I was in and he and I both applied for this internship, GIS internship,
10:55
at the local county office, and I was offered the job, and he wasn’t.
11:01
Both of us also worked on, at a sort of call center, where they
11:06
would do like these political calls, campaigns, you know, sort of taking
11:10
polls, a polling center on campus.
11:12
And so, he used to work there as well and so did I and then both of us, I was
11:16
promoted to a supervisor, and he wasn’t.
11:19
So, these two incidents kind of happened simultaneously, and so I think it upset
11:24
her in some ways and so one evening I come home at night, actually about nine
11:29
o’clock in the night and she says and I’ll never forget the sentence because
11:32
she said, “What is it with you foreigners coming in and taking over the jobs of
11:36
us white Anglo-Saxons?” And for me, I was just like [fist to hand] hit, you
11:41
know, you come home after a long day and there you [slaps hand] go with this and
11:44
I was like, Lillian, I think I know what you’re referring to and I said but, you
11:48
know, I said the playing field has been leveled, you know, and we are here, right
11:54
now, competing equally and I said so this wasn’t anything that was special about me.
12:00
I said this was based on merit in which it happened— [break]
12:10
We stopped briefly and we’re starting up again and taking up where we left off.
12:17
Okay, so I think we stopped at the point where I was mentioning— I’ll repeat her
12:23
statement so that you know I remember it.
12:26
So, as I walk into the house, she goes “what is it with you foreigners
12:29
coming in and taking over the jobs of us white Anglo-Saxons” and so
12:33
it really took— I was taken aback.
12:36
It was late at night, and I just said Lillian, and you know like this— it is
12:41
a level playing field now, and you know, we got this— these jobs based on merit.
12:45
It’s, you know, it’s— it’s what it is, you know, I said I didn’t do
12:50
anything special, or you know, I said in my country I might have bribed the
12:55
official to give me the job, but I said I didn’t do any of those things.
12:58
I said it was my resume that was submitted and I got the job and I said that’s
13:01
something that we have to deal with because that’s where the world is today.
13:05
It’s like a level playing field, and I didn’t say anything too much after that.
13:09
It was just that and then I think overnight— she was very flustered and
13:14
she went to bed and then overnight the next morning it was the weekend, so the
13:18
next morning over breakfast she probably realized it herself in some ways and she
13:23
said essentially I want to apologize for last night, and she said I didn’t mean
13:29
to say what I did, and I know I did say what I did, but I want you to know that
13:34
I really appreciate you, and you know, it’s a— I know that it is very hard for
13:39
you to come to a new country and start a life over and you have no family and
13:43
she’s like and so I really didn’t mean to offend you and she’s like you know
13:47
you’re welcome here and things like that.
13:49
So that was sort of a, I guess, a moment that— in a way, when I realized, too, that
13:56
you know, people have certain thoughts and feelings, and you know, they express it in
14:01
many different ways and I, you know, again how could I be mad with her, you know, she
14:06
was my land lady first of all, and so, our relationship really blossomed after that.
14:12
I said all right so how ‘bout I come to your meetings— where do—
14:17
where are we going because she was a Republican, and she would go for all
14:21
these Red Hat meetings, like literally wear a red hat and go for meetings,
14:24
and so she took me, she said, come.
14:25
I’ll— so I went there with her, went with her to all these meetings, and our
14:30
relationship just completely changed.
14:32
I had friends from India, who were living in England, who visited me.
14:38
She offered her home and the spare— the other spare room to
14:40
them and they stayed with us.
14:43
When my family visited, she got my brother to come sing at her church, and
14:48
our relationship was just completely different, just totally blossomed
14:51
at the time, you know, wherever she needed to go I used to take her, drive
14:56
her around, you know, she didn’t have a license and she’d get into many
15:00
accidents so I used to drive her around.
15:02
I’d say, Lillian, leave your car.
15:03
I’ll take you around and it was just changed.
15:06
Every time I would go to India, every Christmas, I would call
15:08
her, and she was very proud to tell her other friends, ‘Hold on.
15:13
Hold on.
15:13
Please, be quiet.
15:14
I have a call from India.’ It was like a big deal for her to get a call from
15:17
India, and I would call and wish her on Christmas day and New Year’s, you know,
15:20
and it was just a very, very interesting relationship that I had with this—
15:24
My family visited me from India.
15:27
We all went over and met her because by the time, I was in
15:30
Oklahoma and we did a road trip all the way back to Pennsylvania.
15:33
We all went and met her, including— she got to meet my grandma, my disabled
15:38
uncle, my mom, my dad and everyone.
15:40
We all hung out and they were like, ‘We all know you, Lillian.
15:43
Shireen’s told us so much about you.
15:44
And she was so excited that she had this— such a strong connection to
15:48
this family in India and it was just a very interesting thing and you know,
15:52
I kept in touch with her the whole time, you know, through Oklahoma,
15:55
always kept her updated on my progress.
15:57
We had Facebook.
15:58
We became Facebook friends, and then I got the job in Oregon and I even told her
16:03
that I got the job in Oregon and that I would call her once I was here and settled
16:09
and that is when I unfortunately got the news that she had passed and she had— she
16:13
had breast cancer and she used to go for a lot of chemotherapy even I was there
16:16
I used to drive her for some of it and so, that was— that was very interesting—
16:22
memorable relationship that I had with this older lady who we ideologically did
16:28
not connect, but on an emotional level, we were the best of friends, so it’s very
16:34
interesting and I, quite honestly, I don’t think I’ve had that kind of relationship
16:38
with anyone ever since my time in the United States, who I am so ideologically
16:42
different with— but yeah, so like that’s like one of my most interesting
16:48
stories, I guess from Pennsylvania.
16:50
Now I have a ton of them from Oklahoma [laughs] not any,
16:55
none from Alabama really.
16:57
Interesting
16:58
Just interestingly.
16:59
Yeah.
17:01
But.
17:01
[crosstalk]
17:01
Well, would you like to end there or?
17:03
[crosstalk]
17:03
Yeah, I think we could probably pause here because this is probably— I should have
17:09
probably arranged some more time, but—
17:13
[End of Interview on October 26; Beginning of Interview on November 9]
17:37
Okay, so I think we kind of stopped at the end of the Pennsylvania story, and
17:42
I moved to Alabama where it was great.
17:45
I had no weird experiences, and I feel like I fit in.
17:50
There was probably a sizable black community that I lived amongst, and I
17:55
was only there for about nine months before moving to Oklahoma which was a
18:00
drastically different landscape for me.
18:04
The east coast was, I guess, in some way the rural urban, just
18:09
the landscape itself, was sort of something expected coming from
18:12
India, but Oklahoma I did not expect.
18:15
I knew about the west growing up my family always listened to country music
18:19
which I hated, but, you know, I grew up listening to Willie Nelson, and
18:27
Waylon Jennings and you know, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton and now I
18:32
felt like I was living in their midst.
18:34
And
18:37
so, it was great when my parents visited because they loved switching
18:40
the radio stations, but I did not.
18:44
But anyway, so I think I had some of my best years and worst experiences
18:51
in the United States in Oklahoma so it’s sort of a mixed bag of emotions.
18:58
So, I guess a couple experiences that I had one which became pretty widely
19:05
known in town so I attended Oklahoma State University which was in the town
19:09
of Stillwater, Oklahoma which is a town of about 50, 000 people except when
19:16
school is out then it’s about 5000.
19:20
Because it is pretty much all about the college town and so it is sort of just a
19:26
college town for about an hours drive from the big cities of Tulsa and Oklahoma City.
19:32
And a big number of graduate students huge number of graduate students from India
19:39
the largest on the campus were Indian students we were about 500 Indian graduate
19:43
students that attended Oklahoma state.
19:46
And so, over time I ended up becoming the resident of the Indian Student
19:50
Association I was the president of the Indian Student Association for
19:55
two years and then went on to being the president of the international
19:58
student organization for a year.
20:01
So, I always sort of held, these sort of, kind of leadership positions, so when
20:05
things would happen I would typically be the sort of go to, but I had an incident
20:10
that happened with me in a local diner.
20:12
We all would go to this diner because it was open 24 hours kind of reminded
20:18
us of home a little bit in the sense that coffee was 40 cents bottomless
20:25
refillable cup and so often we’d have a night out on the town you know as grad
20:30
students we’d go and hang out at the coffee shop until about 230, three in
20:33
the morning it was a diner not exactly a coffee shop but we had an instance
20:37
there with a girl who later I realized was actually a student at Oklahoma
20:42
State because I saw her on campus.
20:44
She would serve us and not in very, not a very friendly way and we’d observed
20:51
this for a while a bunch of friends and myself and said all right maybe she’s
20:55
having a bad day we kind if sort of always brushed it off for more than a
20:58
year I want to say this happened and more than two or three years actually
21:04
and then one evening it was around homecoming and some friends of ours,
21:09
graduate student friends, had returned to campus and we thought for old times’
21:12
sake let’s go to the diner and so we did.
21:16
And there was this girl again serving us and so a couple of things she used
21:20
to do, if I want to recollect and, you know, if there was some sort of
21:25
syrup on the table I recall this and asked her to clean it up she would come
21:28
with a sort of wet cloth and drop it on the table and say to clean it up.
21:35
And we did you know were from India.
21:36
It’s ok.
21:38
We’ve had these experiences and we can work with it but in this particular
21:42
incident our friend was visiting from out of town and so we went back to the diner
21:46
and she was there and she served us in a disgruntled way and when we went to pay
21:53
the tab there was a new girl in that diner and she told me if you didn’t know, it is
22:01
customary in the United States to tip the waitress and that was just not my night
22:08
so I said to her ma’am you do not know what is happening here I said we’ve been
22:13
coming to this diner for several years.
22:15
And I said if that lady and I pointed to the girl does not like brown
22:20
people she should not serve us.
22:23
I said I will tip anyone else in this diner except her, and so then the
22:30
manager came to the counter and said you all need to leave and I said I would
22:36
like to speak to the manager ‘cause I didn’t know she was the manager.
22:38
She said I am the manager ad you need to leave and I said well, just hear me out.
22:41
She said y’all need to leave.
22:43
Said all right, we paid our tab, walked out into the parking lot.
22:48
The entire staff of the diner came out through the service exit, came into
22:53
the parking lot and told us you all need to get out of the parking lot.
22:57
I said I am going nowhere now until I call the police and so I called 911.
23:02
And the police came they spoke to us in the group.
23:05
We explained our situation explained this has been going on for a while
23:09
and they went and talked to the folks in the diner, came back out and
23:12
said ma’am you’ll have to go or else this will be considered trespassing.
23:18
I said so you are telling me, I told the cops, I said so you are telling me
23:21
there’s nothing in your law that there is nothing in your law that tells you that’s
23:25
happening here is an incident of racism.
23:29
I said we’re just be targeted for what you know we are paying our tab we’re
23:32
paying to be here and so he said ma’am I’m sorry but you’re going to have
23:36
to leave I said all right that’s fine I’m just gonna take this to the press.
23:40
And I did.
23:40
It was about 3am in the morning at that time.
23:43
I went home drafted a letter to the editor for the college newspaper my
23:49
friend, it helped that my friend was the editor and chief so I sent her an
23:53
email the night I said that, you know, Jackelyn, I’m sending you an email and
23:58
I know that your word limit is only 250 words, but I cannot make it shorter
24:03
than that a little over maybe about 300.
24:06
So I wrote it and sent it to her and Monday morning about 8am in the morning
24:10
because all of this happened maybe Friday night or Saturday night Monday
24:14
morning my phone started ringing off the hook you know I had people from
24:20
the International Student Office where I worked calling me I had people from
24:24
cultural diversity offices, senior officials calling me to find out what
24:28
had happened because she published my letter word for word verbatim no editing
24:34
more than 250 words and so it created quite a stir in town I went and met with
24:41
a lot of these individuals on campus and officials and what started happening
24:46
interestingly I started receiving emails and Facebook messages from Indian
24:51
students who had graduated from Oklahoma state but who had read that letter
24:57
that I had published and was sending me paragraphs or pieces that they had sent,
25:03
letters to the college newspaper about similar incidences at that same diner,
25:08
but those letters were not published.
25:10
It was interesting that these folks who had graduated were still reading the
25:13
college newspaper but I started getting these messages and so we realized that it
25:19
was, it seemed to have been a little bit of a larger issues and I guess because
25:23
of the clout that I had being president of the Indian Student Association, this
25:27
ever got published and you know, had my connections, but it did create a stir.
25:33
We had a lot of— eventually thee owner of the diner somehow got my phone number and
25:41
called me and apologized and said I wish you had spoken to me first and I said I
25:46
wish your manager had given me a chance to even know who you are and I said we
25:51
didn’t get that opportunity I said that is the sad part because I wish that we
25:55
had a way to have a conservation about this before I had to resort to what I did.
26:01
But so anyhow so he contacted me and then he wrote a letter to the college
26:09
newspaper apologizing on behalf himself and his staff and welcoming
26:15
all international students that basically saying all international
26:18
students are welcome to the diner.
26:20
A lot of church groups wrote letters to the diner and copied the Indian
26:24
Student Association saying that this should not be happening in town.
26:29
Of course, the college newspaper ran a couple of cartoons for a couple of weeks
26:33
about, you know, a bottle of syrup with internationals not served at the diner
26:37
and some of those sorts of things but sort of creating awareness around this issue
26:40
that this incident had taken place there.
26:43
So that was for me one that was very interesting I’ve
26:46
made peace with the diner.
26:47
I have gone back to Stillwater and gone to the diner seen that
26:51
same girl working there too and so I have made my peace with it.
26:57
That was an instance.
26:58
We’ve had a couple others where our next door neighbors have called us camel jocks.
27:04
The little kid, in fact, came…would swing by the house and yell camel jocks and
27:08
run away and I would run outside and call the kid wanting to try to talk him but he
27:13
always run away and of course, he doesn’t know why he is saying what he is saying
27:17
but he is getting it from somewhere.
27:19
But those were a few of the instances, and I think overall I think that what these
27:27
instances in the US made me realize is also, that beside the othering, it also
27:35
raised my awareness of my privilege at home in India because these were things
27:42
that I had not experienced there but when I, first of all, that I have the
27:47
opportunity to come to this country and thee, regardless of the hardships that
27:53
I might have gone through there’s still a significant portion of the population,
27:58
my fellow country men and women who [door slammed] who for maybe even the next four
28:02
or five generations might not reach the same, reach the shore of the United States
28:09
like I have and to do what I have done and I guess, so that sort of in some ways
28:16
is I reflect on it on very eye opening and revealing I understand a lot about
28:24
why that happens within this country the xenophobia particularly in small
28:30
town and central states like Oklahoma.
28:32
I mean I drove through Oklahoma over the summer I went to see some
28:37
dinosaur footprints out in the Oklahoma panhandle that’s an 8h drive away from
28:42
Oklahoma City and there was nothing between the dinosaur footprints
28:45
and Oklahoma City for eight hours.
28:47
Except some really, really small towns.
28:49
And I drove through these towns stopped for gas always get people turning around
28:55
to look at you because you’re different they haven’t seen someone like you
29:00
there but I think it is still a form of reflection for me to realize how we take
29:10
some of this fitting in for granted in our countries but yet there are people
29:15
that are experiencing discrimination bias prejudice and it’s only heightened in
29:23
ourselves when we experience it ourselves in this country and we recognize that
29:27
there are these kinds of problems there.
29:29
So that’s sort of my own personal reflection on how I view some of this.
29:35
I’ve become a veteran as I mentioned.
29:37
I’ve learned to fight these off battle it off because I feel that there are
29:43
other people more vulnerable than me that could be more effected or effected
29:49
in more deeper way than myself at this stage of my life and so I’m sort of always
29:55
trying to be there for my students and other impressionable young adults who
30:00
these sorts of experiences can set you off on a different path and I think that
30:07
that’s sort of my way of sort of giving back in a sense to try to understand
30:13
this and grapple with it in a way.
30:15
So
30:18
yeah that as much as I know about some of these issues and I still learn a lot
30:25
through other peoples’ experiences but—
30:32
yeah it is just sort of thinking about how to deal with it.
30:35
I don’t think so much how to deal with it rather than sort of trying to analyze
30:42
and reflect on the larger picture about why these things happen and how can we
30:46
deal with those issues rather than you know that sort of one on one how do I
30:50
deal with this in my particular little
30:54
socioecological niche.
30:55
So.
30:58
Yeah, I think that’s about as much as I needed to add to the Oklahoma piece
31:07
so far five years in Oregon nothing.
31:11
Before we started the tape recorder we talked about, I
31:15
forget, the Arkansas, right?
31:18
Which state did you—
31:20
Alabama.
31:20
Alabama and you were saying why it felt different there.
31:24
Could you talk a little bit—
31:25
Yeah, so it was interesting but you know again, I think this relates a
31:30
lot, you know, and again my reflection on some of these things I think
31:35
that a lot of us outside for this country we always hear about the
31:39
good stuff about the United States.
31:42
We and again this is a temporal thing because I grew up at a time
31:47
when we didn’t have the internet in India or it was just coming in.
31:50
We didn’t have Facebook and social media and all these apps so I think people
31:53
are much more aware now outside of the US about race issues for example being
32:00
social scientists and studying geography I knew about the civil rights movement,
32:04
the Civil War and a lot of the other racial issues in the country but you
32:08
know Indian engineering students are clueless about some of this so for them
32:13
it is a very raw awakening and so I think so going to states like Alabama
32:18
I was already expecting to you know see or witness or to hear about some of
32:25
these stories but somehow the towns that I lived in Alabama I fit in and again
32:31
there was sizeable black population and I did not feel like I stuck out.
32:39
I lived in Jacksonville Alabama which is thee main campus for Jacksonville
32:45
State University which I started attending for my master’s program.
32:49
Also commuted between Jacksonville and Anniston Alabama where there was
32:53
a sizeable Indian community that I knew in Anniston and Oxford, Alabama.
32:59
So, kind of smaller towns but there was also a sizeable black population
33:03
and somehow there was a lot of cohesion between the black population
33:06
and the Indian population in these smaller towns so I really felt like
33:13
I fit in I wasn’t I didn’t feel like I looked like the other in Alabama.
33:20
So, I don’t really have any of those weird untoward
33:26
issues to report, yeah.
33:31
Is there anything else you’d like to add to anything that we’ve talked about?
33:36
Nothing else that comes to mind.
33:38
These were sort of a couple of the main things from Oklahoma
33:44
that probably that are the most memorable but also reflective for me.
33:51
Yeah…
33:52
What is it like being here in Corvallis?
33:56
Well, Corvallis I think of all the places I’ve stayed in the US
34:00
the thing that I sort of miss is interacting with black people.
34:04
You know, Oregon is a very white state and I was always exposed to that
34:11
community for throughout my years in the United States which is now 16 years.
34:17
And so, I kind of miss having those interactions but
34:26
I mean, I have not experienced any racial issues but I do know many
34:32
people who have experienced it
34:35
and I think that’s again so that’s mostly among the student population
34:39
and so for me it is more about sort of reaching out and to these communities,
34:43
to the students and making sure they feel
34:47
like they’re worth and value matters.
34:51
Almost like a counterbalance to the rest of what they’re experiencing?
34:55
Yeah,
34:58
that these sort of isolated instances shouldn’t derail them from their
35:05
objectives and their path forward.
35:08
So.
35:10
Growing up in the US,
35:17
I’ve tried to think like we’re used to experiencing certain things, but
35:23
when you were in India you said that you felt coming here made you, helped
35:28
you understand your privilege there.
35:30
Was it a really rude awakening to come to the US and experience that racism
35:38
and that racial history of the US?
35:43
It wasn’t sudden so it sort of built up over time.
35:48
It’s more a sort of process of accretion that I have come to realize that you
35:54
know the fact that I spoke English at home in India was my medium of
36:00
instruction throughout school and college.
36:03
These are all privileges that I did not recognize I had when I was in India and to
36:09
now know that I have to come to the United States and see that that gives me an edge.
36:16
Although I still have an accent It
36:20
had been again the way in which it has made me more cognizant about
36:26
my privileges that I had in India.
36:29
Being able to even get an education is a privilege which again is as a young
36:35
person or a teenager in India we don’t really think about that where, that we
36:41
are in this privileged minority to be, and to win the birth lottery that we
36:50
have those privileges and so I think it was so much a rude awakening as it has
36:54
sort of been a process of growing up maturing and understanding and putting
36:59
these things into the larger context.
37:02
Yeah.
37:05
Yeah.
37:06
How did your family feel about you coming to the
37:11
US?
37:14
OK but of course my mom you know were, were two my brother and myself and my
37:19
mom did not really want me to go because she didn’t think that I would come back.
37:26
She feels like I might come back but she realizes my future is probably here now
37:35
and that I’ve built this community and I’ve lived here for so long that I feel
37:40
like I don’t fit in in India anymore.
37:42
My friends have moved on and so my family is pretty open to being, you
37:49
know, my family, my mom and all are pretty open to maybe spending some
37:54
more time here in the US temporarily and spending half their time in India.
37:58
So…they are resigned to that.
38:00
They enjoy coming to the United States they love traveling here they visit every
38:05
year and come and see me even if it is for two weeks that’s pretty rushed but
38:13
they don’t want to stay in Corvallis when they come so I have to take them
38:16
somewhere or else they are not coming.
38:17
So that’s pretty much the request so these— we have traveled around a
38:22
lot and seen quite a bit for the US and they really enjoy coming to the
38:26
country and but they do enjoy the luxuries of home in India as well so
38:32
we’ll see where that future goes but I would hope that they would come
38:36
and spend a little bit more time.
38:38
Yeah…
38:39
I’ve talked to a few people who have talked about not feeling
38:42
like they fit in back home.
38:45
Yeah.
38:45
Yeah,
38:48
I wish I could think of how to ask my question.
38:53
What it is like to, yeah…
38:55
Well, I’ll tell you the funny one is if I— so I am always culturally improvising when
39:01
I’m here I speak a certain way because I, that’s how I’ve sort of evolved in some
39:08
way to speak so that people understand me particularly while teaching but god help
39:14
me if I slip with a tomato [tuh-MAY-toe] in my house in India because we always
39:18
called it tomato [tuh-MAR-toe] and so it’s just I get to hear it from all sides.
39:24
Oh, you have an American accent now because I just slipped
39:28
with tomato [tuh-MAY-toe].
39:31
So that’s kind of the hilarious parts, but other than that I mean for the most
39:34
part you know the community that my family belongs to and friends and neighbors
39:40
everyone know that I’m in the United States so the discussions sometimes
39:46
come around with you know gun control.
39:49
Those are difficult ones to have with an Indian population where we
39:52
have almost no sense of security or almost no sense of the law and justice
39:59
but we still don’t resort to guns.
40:01
So that’s one of the things that’s a hard conversation to have with
40:07
folks there who sort of ask me for my opinion but again my opinion is
40:10
just my opinion of the United States.
40:13
But the idea of not fitting in you know friends and neighbors and people’s lives
40:18
have moved on as well and their exposure to the internet and social media have
40:23
taken them on a different tangent.
40:26
I left India at the time we had only about 10 years of liberalization so
40:31
when I left the first shopping mall was opened and now shopping malls are
40:37
everywhere so it’s this sort of you know at least among the middle class
40:44
that I belong to in India that’s this very aspirational India and everyone’s
40:49
trying to get the best cell phone and be seen at the best shopping mall and
40:54
having the most trendy bag where and so it’s a very different from life to what
41:01
I lead here and so that’s where I feel like I don’t feel like I fit in a lot.
41:08
That’s not my aspirations.
41:13
My aspirations are not material as they are for a lot of
41:17
my friends in— that I see.
41:21
Mine are more value based and so there’s a big disconnect where that is concerned.
41:28
Try to keep my mom out of the shopping malls but she enjoys walking around
41:32
behind a grocery cart to buy tomatoes [tuh-MAY-toes], tomato [tuh-MAR-toe].
41:37
Avocados are about 5 dollars an avocado in India because they are being ordered in
41:45
the shopping mall and things are much more expensive in these shopping malls they’re
41:50
processed, they’re frozen we can literally buy fresh vegetables just walking down
41:56
the street where we live and so and I think those are the kind of things
42:01
you know we here there is such a love and appreciation for farmer’s markets.
42:07
There we have that and people want to move towards the shopping malls so
42:13
these sorts of paradoxes in some way that I see and experience as it’s very
42:25
jarring for me and I guess that’s the way that I don’t know where I fit in and
42:33
I’m not a permanent resident here yet.
42:36
I’m waiting on paperwork and so I still hold an Indian passport.
42:44
I’m an Indian citizen but I don’t feel like I fit in there and I’m
42:50
not a permanent resident here either so it’s sort of a place that
42:54
I find myself right now where I’m questioning where I belong in some way.
43:03
I don’t know if a piece of paper will change that but it is going
43:07
to be interesting to see as that happens if it does or not.
43:13
So yeah, that’s pretty much where it is for right now.
43:19
How do you
43:22
like living in Corvallis and not really fitting in back home, how are you
43:26
finding your way here and balancing two identities and bringing those together?
43:34
Well, here I teach at Oregon State so most people in town
43:42
who know me know that I do that.
43:46
I belong to the Zonta Club of Corvallis.
43:48
I do some work with women’s organizations and so how I have kind
43:52
of built a network here in Corvallis.
43:54
There’s a sizeable Indian community here, too that I’m a part of
43:57
but not deeply embedded in.
44:01
I’m sort of, I like to do my own thing sometimes, but
44:10
I think in India when I go home, I am always identified as that sort of
44:14
ex-pat in some way and this is thee prodigal daughter that’s returned.
44:20
Thee American because of the tomato [tuh-MAY-toe] but no, I don’t— I think
44:30
in India those issues and questions of identity disappear when I go
44:36
home I don’t have to focus on it.
44:38
I don’t have think about it,
44:43
but I am much more aware of thee class and income disparities in India.
44:50
It’s in your face, particularly Kolkata, the city that I grew up in.
44:54
You cannot avoid seeing the poverty.
44:57
Thee social inequalities.
45:00
I have— there are a couple of girls that work in my house in India.
45:05
I’ve often tried to get them to go to school.
45:09
They’re young adults.
45:10
They are in their teenage years.
45:11
They feel like their parents want to get them married but I want to try to get
45:17
them to go to school but it’s hard I’ve even offered to pay for it but their
45:25
parents have different ideas for them.
45:29
They are sort of bound in a way to you know work and support the family because
45:37
they belong to lower income community so it’s really hard and I want to bring
45:41
about those changes and that’s where I sort of feel frustrated sometimes I feel
45:51
like I cannot do much but I feel saddened that I cannot do much but then I still
45:59
feel like I want to do something and I know that I will and so I support some
46:04
organizations that I can but I know that at the back of my mind there’s
46:09
still that sort of idea that I need to be doing something more I just know
46:14
yet what it is and I guess because I am in this sort of precarious position
46:17
of not knowing where I belong makes it even harder for me to do something
46:23
about things when I am not situated in a position where I have a firm footing yet.
46:33
So again the identity issues don’t arise too much for me in India but it
46:38
is these other thoughts about social inequalities, social injustice that I see.
46:47
And like I said the girls that work in my house I’ve been to their home there home
46:55
is the size of probably a US bathroom and there are six people that live
47:00
in it and I have been to their house.
47:02
I’ve sat and eaten with them I’ve tried to speak to the mom to get them to send
47:07
the kids to school, but cultural change is very hard and it bothers me that I
47:15
cannot spend a longer time in India.
47:21
Trying to change these things because it requires time.
47:24
It requires a lot of time to be embedded in these communities to try
47:27
to talk, to try to have conversations to try to show them the benefits
47:33
of kids having an education.
47:37
So it’s hard, but those are some of thoughts I have when I go home.
47:42
I see those inequalities and I want to do something about it immediately.
47:47
It’s very hard.
47:48
Yeah.
47:48
Yeah
47:54
[long pause] That’s how I am pretty much— I feel hopeless sometimes
47:57
but I still feel like time will come when I can do something.
48:03
Yeah.
48:05
Yeah.
48:07
That would be hard to go back and forth.
48:09
Yeah, it is.
48:09
It is, it is.
48:10
Specially to see them and still be connected and want to make change
48:14
and know that change is possible—
48:17
And like I say these things are not, they are not as far away from us.
48:22
They are right there in my home.
48:24
These girls who are working in my house who have not— who have probably
48:27
had primary education and that’s it.
48:30
And the path forward is to have an education to be able to read and
48:36
right and have literacy you know
48:40
but yeah, it’s kinda hard to
48:44
change that.
48:45
Yeah, I just wish I could spend more time doing it.
48:48
Yeah
48:49
Yeah.
48:49
A lot of time ahead I hope.
48:51
Yeah, I hope, I hope
48:54
Well, do you want to continue or would you like to stop there?
48:58
That’s about all I have unless you have a question that takes me off on another
49:03
route that I’m not thinking about
49:06
Let me think.
49:08
I’m trying to think about what you talked about last time.
49:11
I
49:14
remember you telling me the story before about your parents and going
49:19
home and they wanted to go shopping for vegetables and you were like there
49:25
are vegetables right here and they wanted to go push the shopping cart.
49:31
I thought that was very interesting.
49:33
Well, it’s also a kind of status symbol for people to be seen there and I
49:38
teach my students about this you know McDonalds advertises themselves as
49:42
fine dining in India and again this is very interesting because you cannot
49:48
get a burger for a dollar in India.
49:50
It’s very expensive and only the middle class and upper middle classes
49:54
can actually afford McDonalds.
49:56
But it is seen as a status symbol to go to McDonalds you know when I go to India
50:00
I want to go eat kebab on the street and my friends want to go to McDonalds because
50:05
that’s like the cool place to hang out.
50:07
That’s where cool people are seen and so again it’s very interesting
50:13
to see that and I’ve kinda learned to reflect on these changes and how
50:17
gain this is an aspirational India.
50:19
This is where they want to be.
50:21
Where they want to go.
50:22
It’s where they want to be seen.
50:25
Based on the levels of income that they have and it’s a
50:29
completely different scene there.
50:31
Do you think the disparity is greater between incomes is…greater than
50:36
it used to be or between classes?
50:39
Certainly and growing although in India the middle class can also be divided.
50:46
You have an upper middle class, a middle class and a lower middle class in India
50:50
and that’s pretty stark, those lines.
50:53
Not everyone can enter a shopping mall in India.
50:56
If you are someone who cleans the street, and you don’t look the part if you are not
51:01
dressed right the security guards will not allow you in so it’s not equitable, it’s
51:07
not accessible to everyone and those are some of things I tune into when I go home.
51:14
I absorb these things.
51:15
And maybe as a social scientist I’m trained to observe
51:19
that as well and I see it.
51:23
But yeah, my mom likes to go to the shopping mall because she can afford to
51:27
pick up stuff that is important and you know before when I would go back from
51:32
the United States I would take a lot of things like you know particularly food.
51:37
In terms of clothing there’s very little that you can get in United States that’s
51:40
made in the United States these days.
51:42
So I would take a lot smoked cheese like my mom likes smoked cheese.
51:46
But now she just tells me no don’t bring any.
51:48
We get it all here.
51:50
And you’re getting them in the shopping malls which is you know they’re
51:53
bringing in stuff from other countries.
51:55
That’s comparable equal probably cheaper, too.
52:00
So…and we have a lot of influence not just from the United States
52:03
but from Australia and European countries so…so…pretty big market…yeah
52:10
I am curious, too and again I’m still trying to figure out how to ask my
52:16
questions and learn how to do that.
52:18
I notice, I didn’t notice it as much in your class somewhat…I think I noticed
52:23
it more in Dr. de Silva’s class and there was a woman who came and spoke
52:28
to one of my other geography classes and I noticed that students tended to
52:33
question those professors question them and challenge them in a different way.
52:38
Have you found that to be the case teaching at OSU?
52:45
I haven’t tuned into that and it might be because I’ve not had an experience
52:49
of observing or being in another classroom except my own and so I
52:54
haven’t experienced that with students.
52:55
I know students will question and always often ask them to question
52:59
me and I always let them know that I have my limitations and that I do not
53:03
know everything and I will follow up with them if I don’t know something.
53:08
But I also let them know that I offer them a different perspective and it
53:12
might not be the perspective that they have been exposed to and that they come
53:16
into the class with and it might be in contradiction to their perspective
53:23
but it is a perspective none the less.
53:26
And you know so I haven’t faced those challenges in a face to face class.
53:33
I have faced them in an online class and that might just be the content
53:39
of the course and not sure whether—
53:42
Or the anonymity of it?
53:44
Or the anonymity of it, yeah because I do mention even in my online
53:49
classes who I am where I grew up where I came from so my background
53:53
is very clear and very apparent.
53:58
But I think it might be the content of the class that I kind of face push back on.
54:05
I think what I’ve seen is questioning of credibility which I
54:11
don’t see that in some of my other classes with maybe white male
54:14
instructors and so it always catches me a bit by surprise and that could be
54:22
just because I’m older…I don’t know.
54:23
Right.
54:26
I have not yet experienced that yet.
54:30
I will say.
54:32
And even then in subtle ways I have not tuned into it
54:40
but no it has not been apparent to me yet at Oregon State.
54:44
I hope I don’t have to encounter that but you never know you do get some
54:49
students that might question that but I have not yet experienced that.
54:53
yeah…
54:54
What have you noticed being a trained geographer coming from India to here?
55:01
What have you noticed that you would remark on?
55:08
Ah, there’s so much and I think more and more of it is coming out now
55:13
in the current political cycle that is just exposing this under belly
55:19
of the united states to the rest of the world in very crude raw ways,
55:27
you know, this issue about guns,
55:33
that’s something for me that I am struggling to wrap my head around.
55:40
I understand why some people might need it for hunting.
55:45
I don’t like the idea of hunting personally because we grew up in a culture
55:50
where you know you are sort of living in symbiosis with nature in some ways.
55:58
Not entirely but in some ways, not entirely and so we have a lot have a
56:04
lot of debates on social media with friends and family in India that are
56:08
constantly questioning the need for guns here in the country particularly
56:12
in light of mass shootings and instances that are happening every day.
56:18
So that’s something that is opening up a whole lot of things for me spatially I
56:27
know there are vast equalities across the US things have changed and again living
56:32
in Oklahoma and seeing the decline of small towns the fear of some of this.
56:40
I was reading an article yesterday about Johnstown, Pennsylvania an old mining
56:43
town and again living that Alabama through Pennsylvania that old rust belt ah well
56:48
the mining belt and some of the towns that have been in decline there for several
56:53
years and continue to decline with the loss of jobs and mining and employment.
56:57
And I see that
57:01
these towns are closing down and I guess in my ideal world I am wondering
57:05
why can’t we have a well-designed refugee resettlement policy
57:14
this might be my idealistic way of thinking but I see this happening in
57:18
European towns that are in decline.
57:22
They are offering I mean for a town to be able to survive you need to
57:26
be able to have people to consume you need to be having people to not
57:30
just run the businesses but to be the customers of those businesses.
57:34
And I saw a documentary called salaam neighbor which was on the
57:40
Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan that’s a Syrian refugee camp living
57:45
right across the border in Jordan.
57:47
And these are refugees, these are people who crossed the border with nothing
57:51
they’ve been there for a couple years and the turn over in that refugee
57:54
camp is in the millions of dollars.
57:57
So… I think about that and see rural small town Oklahoma, you know, American
58:03
decline and I am thinking… why are we not… thinking of a way to transpose this but
58:12
of course I understand there’s going to be this cultural backlash this xenophobia
58:15
you know suddenly you have people with their heads covered in these towns and
58:20
it’s gonna be this who are these people they are alien but again as a geographer
58:27
I’m thinking of this spatial distribution spatial reallocation and you know there is
58:31
so much so many opportunities amidst the ton of challenges this might provide but…
58:39
I think that’s happening quite a bit in Minnesota.
58:42
Is that right it’s happening in Minnesota.
58:43
I think so.
58:43
In the Syrian, there’s big Syrian population in Minneapolis
58:47
Not Syrian….
58:48
but I know that they have had a big push [hmm…yeah]
