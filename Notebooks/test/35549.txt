00:02
And so, for
00:07
the interview
00:25
I think the question I want to start out with is just how you came
00:28
here and what was surprising, what was difficult, and you can tell
00:32
it in whatever way you would like.
00:34
OK, yeah, so I came to US in 1979, which is, I think, towards end of
00:43
winter, beginning of spring and the reason…and my sisters, two of my,
00:50
three of my sisters were already here.
00:53
One…they came in 1977-78, and we came to Tillamook, Oregon, and how
01:01
we came there was our guardian dad, who is so, really quick background,
01:08
our guardian dad, he’s Hugh Wood and he was a faculty member/educator in
01:15
University of Wash, I’m sorry, University of Oregon, so he taught there and
01:21
then he, once they retired, he had established a foundation which was called
01:29
American Nepal Education Foundation.
01:32
Both he and his wife what they wanted to do was…Nepal was a closed country
01:39
‘til the 50s around 50 so no foreigners were allowed to go in but so when he
01:44
was India he just had an opportunity.
01:47
He’s always wanted to go to Nepal, but didn’t have that.
01:50
Somebody was going there, flying there, to take some goods, and was invited
01:55
to go, to take him, so that was how he went to Nepal and then he fell in love
02:00
with the country but couldn’t go back until they opened up for the foreigners
02:04
and that’s when, you know, he and his wife went there and wanted to support
02:10
Nepalese, young Nepalese men and women who were going into education so that was
02:17
his, so the foundation was established so anybody who was coming, who wanted to
02:24
go into education and working on their masters they would he had agreement with
02:31
like University of Oregon, OSU, Ohio State and a lot of the east coast schools
02:37
had an agreement of where providing, he would provide some of the income for
02:44
the tuition as well as working with the university to provide so they had a full
02:48
scholarship when they are completing and he actually played major role in starting
02:56
and improving the education system in Nepal during that time so he was very
03:01
integral part so my mom and dad when he and his wife would be in Nepal to setting
03:07
up all of this my mom and dad worked for him so my dad was driver for him and my
03:13
mom did housework and cleaning and she would take my siblings with them with her
03:22
and his wife got to know my sisters, you know, all but two of us grew up around
03:28
there and so even though their goal was just bringing students who were doing
03:33
their master’s program and then going back to their country to give back and teach.
03:39
They broke that rule a bit because they got to know my mom and dad and my siblings
03:44
and then they said ok we need to at least do something so they agreed to sponsor
03:51
us to come here to go to school and get our education so we were the first of
04:00
the many after, you know, following us, who have that opportunity to come live
04:05
with him and his wife and go to school and then get our degrees and then hope
04:12
was of going back to Nepal to give, you know, to give back to the community so
04:17
that’s how we ended up coming here because of the connection to him and his wife.
04:23
And then all of us finished our school getting the scholarship through the
04:29
American Nepal Education Foundation.
04:32
So, we all had a full tuition so we…I finished my undergrad and grad school
04:39
without a debt coming out of it and my siblings and all of were same in
04:45
finishing whatever field we chose.
04:47
How old were you when…
04:50
I was nine years old.
04:51
When I came in ’79.
04:54
When you went to college did you come to OSU?
04:56
Yeah, I did.
04:58
I did both my, in ’87, I came to do my undergraduate and then right after that
05:04
in ‘91/’92 winter of ’92 maybe I went to…I started my master’s right after.
05:12
Did you come through EOP [Educational Opportunities Program]
05:15
? No, I was a…up until late ‘90s early 2000 I was still considered international.
05:23
I had international visa so when I came at age of 9 I came on F1 visa and then
05:29
I stayed through F1 visa and then I was in J1 visa for a short time at OSU
05:35
and got switched to F1 and then yes, even when I worked at EOP, I had H1
05:43
visa, H1B visa which is a work visa.
05:49
So a lot to negotiate, hah, yeah?
05:51
Yeah
05:53
So the first one was probably done for you and then the other two you
05:57
would have had to have done, yeah?
05:59
Um…no, actually, I had to negotiate because when I was going…when I started
06:05
fourth grade in ’79, fourth grade through high school, I was an F1 visa,
06:11
and then, when I came to OSU, I don’t know how it got switched to J1 and J1
06:16
visa at that time and I don’t know how it is now but at that time J1 was very
06:22
strict and whether you can work during your off, you know, when you didn’t have
06:28
school non-academic year and also was strict in terms whether you can work
06:35
after you finish your…after you graduated so and knowing how strict it was I
06:41
wanted to go back to my F1 so it took a little bit of time but I was like…so my
06:47
argument was I didn’t change the visa.
06:49
I came with F1 and so I would like to stay with it so then eventually it took
06:53
some time but I got it switched to F1.
06:56
So yeah.
06:58
What was it like coming here…do you remember?
07:04
I do.
07:04
So
07:07
I came by myself.
07:09
So I flew from Nepal all the way to, halfway around the world, by myself,
07:14
and I think part of it was, you know, once you’re granted a visa in
07:20
Nepal you have certain days of it.
07:22
They’ll say when are you traveling and you have certain days of it so it’s not
07:24
like you get a visa and you have year to decide when you are going to leave right?
07:29
So my mom we had gotten the tickets and all and then
07:38
the evening that I was supposed to fly there was a really terrible storm and then
07:45
so the flight was cancelled and so my mom is like no just for the whole old wives’
07:53
tales all like once you leave home it’s bad luck to come back and all so my mom
07:58
was really determined that I was going to get on some plane that night and so she
08:05
was able to find a plane where it would, it went from Nepal to India and then in
08:12
India it would change to a flight that would take me to US and so and this was
08:20
with me not knowing a word of English, you know, I knew how to read and write
08:26
Nepali whatever a fourth grader, you know, nine year old can read so I had some cue
08:30
cards and all just basic stuff, you know, being able to if I was hungry or where’s
08:38
the bathroom you know I was able to read and show them the card in English so I
08:42
had some cue cards but I really didn’t know a word of English except for hello
08:47
how are you and so when I was coming and I always say like you know my life could
08:54
have taken a different turn when we got to India is because at that time, you
09:00
know, only the stewardess knew that you were traveling by yourself and they were
09:05
the responsible party for any minors.
09:08
So, when we got there stewardess told me ok wait at this waiting room.
09:13
She took me to the waiting room again she didn’t speak Nepali.
09:17
I didn’t speak English She wasn’t an Indian stewardess so we couldn’t even
09:23
speak the Hindi language so only thing we could do is you know just through
09:29
non-verbals and all of…and I understood she wants me to wait but it was late at
09:34
night so I had fallen asleep and when I woke up the waiting area was empty
09:41
so then I was like oh, ok they must have forgot me and so my thinking was
09:48
you know Nepal India not very far you know I’ll just grab my bag and I’ll
09:54
just go home and maybe surprise my mom.
09:57
You know, I’ll say, well guess what I’m back and so and that was really the
10:02
thinking I was I didn’t, you know, I had no concept of ok we’re in Delhi and
10:07
where is Delhi in terms of Kathmandu so for me that was what I was thinking.
10:12
I said you know how far of a walk could that be.
10:15
So, I grabbed my backpack and then I was…I saw the door and just as I am walking
10:22
and then the door automatic door opened and I could see that it was pouring
10:27
rain just as it opened and I am about to take a step forward I feel a hand on
10:33
my shoulder and that lady was crying.
10:36
Because you could tell that she had forgotten me she’s like…she was crying
10:42
and said come and she picked me up and took me and you know the plane everybody
10:47
was in there already so that’s why I was like this woman had forgotten me
10:52
you know so then I was sat next to this elderly white American and for whatever
11:00
reason from that moment on she just decided to take me under her wing and
11:03
you know making sure I was eating she was playing with me and again there was
11:07
no language but just through non-verbals and all so from India ‘til we got to
11:14
Portland and that’s where she got off too she was really like very motherly
11:20
and you know she was in a wheelchair and so once we got off the plane she
11:26
wasn’t ready to let go so she actually…so my guardian, my god sister picked me
11:32
up and I was literally my god-sister was crying and pulling me one way.
11:38
This woman and her wheelchair was pulling me one way and I’m like I have no idea
11:44
you know and my god sister doesn’t speak Nepali either so I was…I don’t know
11:48
what’s going on but later my sister was saying well that woman wanted to…was
11:53
like how could you anybody let a child fly by themselves is not deserving of a
11:59
child so she wanted to take…to take me so that’s how I came to being in Tillamook.
12:07
You were very lucky in India that she caught you.
12:09
Yeah, yeah, I always think like what if you know because there’s no
12:14
way I would have made it to Nepal.
12:15
I know that now as an adult 47 year old _____ but at that time you know
12:20
thinking that oh it’s you know just a hop away yeah I always wonder what would…I’m
12:26
sure my life would not have turned out good you know it would not have…that
12:31
decision would not have been for the best but as a nine year old, thinking, you
12:37
know to countries are next to each other how far could it be it is just a mountain
12:44
divides us right [laughing] so, yeah.
12:48
So you said two sisters were already here were they in Tillamook?
12:51
Three sisters.
12:52
Three sisters?
12:53
Yeah and they were in high school so my two older sister who are twins they
12:58
were already in high school and then my other sister, Helen, was there already.
13:03
In Tillamook?
13:03
Yeah.
13:04
Wow…so what was it like being in Tillamook?
13:10
It was shocking, yeah it was, I think it was predominately white.
13:17
It’s a dairy farm, right?
13:20
So it’s predominately white with exception of maybe, I know, in the fourth grade
13:28
when I started I know that you know there was a student who was Native American
13:33
even though at that time I had no concept of what Native American was you know
13:37
she had brown skin like I did and then my teacher had adopted a Korean girl so
13:45
she, so I knew that she was Asian so it was three of us in the classroom really
13:50
other than in a predominately white so you know a few, just a simple few things
13:57
that really was shocking for me just from the notice of Nepal was like you
14:03
know that there was no animals and of any like dogs or cows anything on the street.
14:08
So, that was for me like oh my gosh where is all the animals and all you
14:12
know so that was shocking but my…I was in fourth grade for about 5 to 6
14:22
months or a little bit less so and I was just…they put me into that just according
14:28
to the age and then they were going to assess at the end of the summer how I’m
14:35
doing with my reading and writing and speaking to see if I should be held back
14:39
on…in fourth grade or can they just go ahead and send me into the fifth grade.
14:45
So that six months it was you know as a nine-year-old who is
14:50
just learning how to speak still.
14:52
It was interesting in how kids can make you realize you’re different, you know?
14:59
Whether it’s your skin color or whether it’s how you say things
15:07
so you were made…so even though at nine you may not have been able to put a right
15:12
word of this is what is going on…you were made to…made sure that you knew that
15:18
ok my skin is dark so that’s not good.
15:22
Right?
15:23
And then also there’s also there’s particular few white students who
15:30
would pit three of us against each other do you know what I mean so one
15:36
would tell, I mean the one girl will come and say oh, that girl she’s going
15:42
to hurt you and you’re like what?
15:46
And then through non-verbals and all they manage to…it’s like playing charades
15:52
actually…they’d manage to tell you what it is so then you’re like oh, she’s
15:57
gonna hurt me right then you are looking at her and trying to be mean again not
16:04
knowing what’s going on so there was a lot of that just and that was just
16:08
soon as I got here you know within that four to five months of fourth grade.
16:13
So was that it’s kind of like they’re taking advantage of
16:15
you not speaking the language?
16:18
I think they were taking advantage of me not speaking the language but
16:23
also, they’re…it was their way of letting you know that you are different
16:29
Yeah, for sure.
16:30
And whether as nice as they were I think that they didn’t like it.
16:36
Yeah, and I think the best way rather than you know than three people of color being
16:43
friends they were keeping us separate.
16:45
Right.
16:47
So then like you know it would be like they would, so derogatory names they
16:53
would call you know they were telling us and then then you are saying it so
16:59
like with the Native American woman I mean not woman but young girl you
17:04
know they would say Indian, right?
17:06
And then so then they’re not only saying Indian to you and you hear that but
17:11
they’re also telling you, you know, oh, she’s going, she says hurt you.
17:18
She has a knife and these were the conversations and then you’re like so
17:23
if something if you are line and she’s behind me they are pushing her against
17:30
me right so I don’t see it and I’m looking and there was few time where
17:34
I would say the word Indian again not knowing and I don’t think she even knew
17:39
you know as a nine year old, nine year
17:44
olds, of what that meant so for me I think I was saying it in the form of trying
17:50
to hurt her, but we are both looking at each, but then I’m like well, I don’t
17:54
know why I said that or what does that even mean you know but I knew the way
18:00
the white students were using it was in a negative way or bad way but I didn’t
18:05
really know but then I’m saying it I think in a hurtful manner but again not
18:12
knowing the context of what that was you know and what that meant for her so yeah
18:19
so that was like the first time while I was hear just learning the language.
18:26
Kids at nine being able to do that…
18:27
Yeah.
18:28
Yeah.
18:33
Is there anything else about growing up in Tillamook?
18:36
So, yeah, so I think, so like I said the time I was there from age nine to my, you
18:45
know, fourth grade ‘til, age 9 to 16, 17,
18:49
I would say as much as there was some good memories, you know, growing up
18:56
at the beach with my guardian dad and my mom and my siblings and also when
19:00
my cousins came to high school and all and you know being able to work.
19:06
There was just as much, the negative experience which was…made me I
19:14
can’t wait to get out of here.
19:16
So, living outside, 10 miles outside the town, I probably I would say a
19:21
savior for us because we were 10 miles outside of town right by the beach
19:27
so you know on weekends once we did our chores we could go hang out the
19:32
beach and do what not and you know we really didn’t come to town as much.
19:37
Then as we got older to the working age then I worked at J.C. Penny so
19:42
I would come to work but lot of our experience was with the high school
19:47
students, you know, with our peers.
19:49
So, what is interesting is that while we weren’t the only people of color or
19:57
foreigners that was going to school in high school, and I think I experienced
20:01
this, middle school was fine, but I think when I got to high school, all
20:06
of us experienced this as while you know there were other foreign students
20:10
coming we were the target not the foreign students who did exchange programs and
20:18
I think couple factors I would say is I think part of it is because most of the
20:23
exchange students were from South America right or Europe so or Australia or New
20:31
Zealand so I don’t know if it is like they saw them as you know again light
20:38
skinned blonde and all where there they saw them as a little bit closer to them
20:43
and how they looked and then for us, you know, we were all dark skinned dark hair
20:49
thick accent and so we really got a brunt of it, you know, on a regular basis.
20:56
So it went from after me I had, my brother came, and then my two
21:01
other sisters came and my two other sisters they came here literally
21:06
not going to school at all in Nepal.
21:09
I mean they did not even know how to read and write in Nepali.
21:13
And they came when they were 17-18 years old, so they were really starting from
21:19
like ground zero in the language and all.
21:22
SO, they were in some of the ESL classes and all which was you know was made
21:26
fun of because during that time ESL class it was not what it is now, right?
21:31
I mean they were, it was a mixture of students.
21:33
So that is where they were put until they were able to test out and all.
21:38
So whether it’s being in the bus and being picked on, you know, coming and
21:46
just closing the window in front of you or planting things in your school bag
21:51
and then telling you you stole their stuff to…so there was a lot of that
21:56
to just calling names and very sexual comments and all where again as a….I
22:06
didn’t know these terminologies so I would depend on my, who I thought were
22:10
my friends, I’d say he said that you guys were laughing what did that mean?
22:15
And you know they’re not saying it so eventually I’m finding out and
22:19
then reacting like day later, right?
22:22
SO there many times there were fights you know verbal and pushing and
22:26
shoving fights in the bus and a lot of times that was defending my sisters
22:32
because they were picking on the weak.
22:34
Or in the classrooms and stuff, you know, really you would be opening your locker
22:41
and they will come and slam the door and they didn’t care if your hand was there
22:45
or not and saying you know go back to Africa you know we don’t want you here go
22:49
back to Africa and that that always seems to be the statement go back to Africa
22:55
and so few ways of the ways I try to address that is like the kids who I knew
23:03
who would make those direct comments if there was some classes we were together
23:09
so sometimes I would ask the instructor you know teacher can have five minutes you
23:15
know with these kids and sometimes they were hesitant to give me five minutes,
23:19
sometimes they would, but then the kids wouldn’t come you know to meet with me
23:23
so then in front of everybody I would, there was times when I would draw a map
23:27
you know I would take a map of Africa.
23:29
I would take a map of Nepal and Asia and I would say if you’re going to insult
23:34
me or if you’re gonna say things that’s gonna hurt me at least be smart about it.
23:38
Know where is Africa.
23:40
Know where is, my country is.
23:43
Here’s the map so I would say and they would get pissed of
23:46
more because I am putting them,
23:50
confronting them, in front of everybody.
23:52
Then I would be we’ll have a quiz tomorrow.
23:54
You know, at least be smart of it.
23:57
If you’re going to insult me and so there was a lot of that but also like
24:01
the, you know, the vice principals, you know when we would go and talk to them,
24:07
they would literally tell us like oh, that can’t be them they go to my church
24:11
they’re good kids, you know, they’re, they volunteer at church and they do this and
24:17
that and I don’t believe they said it.
24:19
So then we would just walk out of their office and then he would
24:22
get pissed that we walked out, but it’s like…so it was really, it
24:30
was really you know at least few times a week for four years was like that.
24:37
That’s a lot.
24:38
Whether that’s defending myself or defending my siblings and you know I had
24:44
a good friend who lived in Tillamook and she used to tell me like few years later
24:49
after graduation when we used to be in touch she would be like yeah, I ran into
24:52
so and so and he still remembers when you embarrassed him and I said good then
24:58
maybe he won’t do that to somebody else.
25:00
Yeah, because she was, he was like oh, that da-da-da I can’t believe she
25:04
brought that map and thought I didn’t know what I was talking about and I
25:07
was like you didn’t know, you know?
25:09
So they’re still feeling the impact of that… That’s very interesting.
25:13
Yeah, because there are some names and stuff that triggers.
25:16
It takes me back you know so it’s like there’s some names that I’m like oh, ok
25:23
and I know like I don’t think that I can ever be friends with somebody named that.
25:28
Because it was such a, you know, four years of it.
25:33
Yeah, even my sister were like yeah even…because some times she
25:37
will say you know if you met some stranger with that name do you think,
25:41
and you didn’t know them, do you think you could get to know them?
25:43
And I said no.
25:45
Wow.
25:45
It’s just the…what that name meant and what they did.
25:52
And it sound like your sisters have a similar…carry that same.. baggage/burden.
25:58
Yeah, particular names of it, yeah.
26:01
Wow, that sounds…difficult.
26:05
That kind of leads into one of my other questions of asking about like
26:10
how do…how do all those decisions made by those students, by the principal,
26:18
by other community members….how did that affect how your self-image?
26:26
So, I…
26:27
…formation of self….
26:28
Yeah, I think
26:32
when I was younger I know that it,
26:38
I would kind of be conscious of my skin tone.
26:42
You know because again it was not only you know the kids saying and I don’t
26:47
know if you’re familiar because if you look at like India and Nepal they are
26:51
really big on skin lightening creams.
26:54
Ah, I had heard of that, yeah.
26:57
And both of the countries and that’s like a billion dollar, you know,
27:02
industry where the advertisements and all so even though just like India you
27:07
know Nepal has different skin tone.
27:09
There are people your skin tone to darker than mine, right?
27:15
So but it’s always, you were taught so the consequence in hearing that and
27:20
then the kids making fun of you for your skin color and all it makes you
27:27
kind of be wary, like okay am I…so you start questioning like okay am I pretty?
27:33
What does it mean having dark hair?
27:35
Should I be standing in the sun, getting darker?
27:39
So those were some of things that you question and I think and then if you
27:43
see relatives or other Nepalese people then they will be like don’t stand in
27:48
the sun anymore you’re getting dark you know you should tell your teacher if
27:52
you ride by the window because I’m like I’m right by the sun in the classroom.
27:56
Well, you should tell them to move you to other side.
27:59
So there’s the mixture of it so not only the white students making you
28:04
feel like you’re lesser because of your skin color but also then you
28:09
have a little bit from your community members whenever you see them to make
28:13
you...then it’s like okay what’s the validation here is it true or not?
28:17
So, I think for a while that was you know something you questioned about and
28:24
made you feel like okay darkness is bad right and then you’re trying to get into
28:30
getting your skin lighter and lighter with it, but I think when I came to
28:35
college I was conscious of being in an area where there were diverse students.
28:46
And when I came here, I knew that like West International hall had…you know it
28:50
was an international house and actually I really wanted to move there but that
28:55
was age 21 and over so I couldn’t.
28:58
So, when I moved here and I made…I was involved with like hall
29:01
counsel and really made sure I had friends from all backgrounds.
29:07
You know, so not only with few Nepalese people that was here but also with you
29:13
know black students to international students to other Asian students
29:17
domesticate the white students.
29:19
I made sure that, that was my circle and made sure of talking and all of
29:28
being, really paying attention to okay how do they treat me you know what do
29:32
they say and all to being able to make sure that you know I can trust…people.
29:38
So for me in college that was my that was important to me in making
29:45
sure that I was in a setting that had people from all backgrounds.
29:51
How did that…trying to think how to ask it…how did that change how
30:01
you thought about yourself…where you were able to trust perhaps…
30:06
I think it changed…it
30:14
took a while…it does take a while for it because you know it’s not something
30:20
that you’re just like I’m here now this.
30:23
So any time people complimented me or what not I would just like…
30:27
Is it real?
30:27
Yeah, that’s not true, you know so it does take a while for it and
30:32
I think I think by…once I started taking classes that whether it was in
30:40
women’s studies class or other classes that talked about diversity and all.
30:47
I think that’s where I started to understand and then
30:49
understanding ‘bout racism and
30:53
then and about
30:58
this country and the overall world how, you know, how you’re treated
31:05
not for the difference that you have.
31:10
So it did take me a little while but in the midst of it all though
31:14
I really, I have to say I have the confidence right but you still kind
31:19
of question a little bit of it.
31:21
I had the confidence and if somebody said something I was able to just
31:26
address or say you know so even coming to…coming here going to shops
31:33
in Corvallis and all I still felt.
31:36
You know, whether it’s staring or following you in the store to you know
31:45
or treating you can’t afford to buy something and so that still goes on even
31:51
to this day so some of that stuff I was still experiencing and then so I think one
31:56
thing I learned was you know if they were you know if I knew if they were hesitant
32:03
in showing me things in the stores when I’ve asked then I think one of the thing
32:07
was I would ask to have them to show me everything under that cupboard right?
32:12
Because they were already and then just walk away or what not or just being able
32:18
to tell them why are you following me?
32:21
So you know being able to confront some of it I think that through the Tillamook
32:27
and all that I think that’s what instilled and you know for my two sisters who did
32:34
not speak as well or didn’t understand much in high school I had to stand up
32:39
for them you know and so I think that taught me to just be aware and then if I
32:46
see something then standing up for that.
32:50
So I think in terms of there may be a little bit of fear of what would that
32:54
mean but I still I would put that fear
33:01
and just make a statement or talk or ask questions and then
33:05
I never went back to the store.
33:07
You know, there’s a few stores here that I didn’t…that I haven’t gone back to
33:11
because it’s just like you know I don’t need to give you that, my business.
33:17
That’s interesting that came out and I could see having your sisters there
33:21
and wanting to be really protective, make sure that they were okay.
33:28
That’s really…thank you for sharing that.
33:31
Did I answer that question for you?
33:32
Yeah, I feel like it, yeah.
33:35
How do you feel now about who you are and where you stand just out of curiosity?
33:42
About who I am?
33:43
Yeah, self-image.
33:43
Well, now that I’m older closer to 50 I think I am confident in who I am.
33:51
I don’t you know versus when you’re younger you’re doubting
33:55
from what people have said and then to just trying to get validation.
33:59
So I’m at the age I’m like confident in who I am, and you know, and my culture
34:04
and the mixture of Nepalese culture and westernized culture that I was…trying to
34:11
balance the two world and I feel like, which includes my siblings too I feel like
34:16
we’ve done a, I think we’ve done a really
34:21
good in understanding and accepting both parts because most of us
34:26
we came when we were teenagers.
34:28
Well, for me, you know at nine years old, the western way of life was what
34:33
I knew then through my siblings and all holding onto small portions of
34:40
our culture and who we are because our religion and culture is intertwined
34:45
together there’s no difference.
34:46
You can’t separate.
34:47
SO I think for me now I think yeah, I think I’m confident and I think
34:54
I am more aware so when I am going somewhere I am aware of my surroundings.
35:00
A lot more than maybe when I was younger.
35:04
And but one thing I know that there’s just been very few times
35:08
I’ve had to confront but most of the times, most of the times it’s
35:15
like when you go to restaurants and the waitress is taking you.
35:18
There’s all these empty seats but they’re taking you to all the way by the
35:20
restroom and I don’t know if when I was young if I would have probably not said
35:26
anything but now I’m like you know no.
35:30
So then it’s like no I don’t want to sit there and then letting them know why.
35:35
It’s like you have all these empty tables you sat somebody there after…you know…they
35:42
came after us but why are we right by the restroom, so I’m more vocal about
35:48
that and I think my sisters are too.
35:52
Actually one of my sisters probably more vocal than I am with it but I think we’re
35:57
just…we just call it for what we see.
36:01
And, I think that is been our……..that’s been for me but I think I’m at
36:06
that, like I said I think I’m at that age where I’m like, you
36:08
know…what’s…what do I have to lose?
36:14
Just being able to just recognize what’s going on and just talking and saying.
36:19
And when you were younger are those things that you would have noticed?
36:23
I mean, did you mark them?
36:25
And just didn’t speak?
36:27
You know…I
36:30
know…that well…I did do and again this seems like so long ago because I know with
36:39
like incident that happened in the bus and all again in the bus it wasn’t towards me.
36:44
You know, it was towards my two sisters and I think like I said they always
36:47
seemed to pick on the weakest ones right or who they think are weak.
36:51
So, for example, in the bus what would happen is the bus ride from school to
36:55
home is an hour, you know, we were in the morning we were first to be picked
36:59
up and but in the evening, we were last to be dropped off so along the way you
37:04
know specially like if it…you know we would…I would read a book and just hope
37:11
that everybody just leave me alone.
37:12
My sisters would sleep.
37:14
So, there’s time when I’m reading book but I can see like
37:17
they are planning something.
37:20
And then they will always encourage the youngest one so they would go and
37:24
open my sister’s bag and I wouldn’t say anything, you know and open my sister’s
37:28
bag and they would put like a pencil of theirs or a comb or whatever it is and
37:33
then they’ll wait a bit and then they’ll go and she’s sleeping in the bus and
37:38
they will reach over and put the window down if it is up or put the window up
37:42
if it is down and then, you know, my sister not knowing she’d just woke up
37:46
and she’s just like why did you do that?
37:48
And they would like be in her face saying you stole something of his and
37:53
you know, again, no knowing, she’s like no, I didn’t check my bag right.
37:59
They check the bag and there it is…so those are the times where then I watch
38:03
it and then after that…there’s been times when I reach two seats over and
38:08
pulled it…pulled those guys over towards me and then we’re in a screaming match.
38:13
Never punches or what not but screaming match, just fighting and then the bus
38:19
driver would have to stop the bus, you know, for us to all sit down, and that
38:23
would happen multiple times, right?
38:26
Or if I’m going to a store and again this is my peer who works at
38:33
that store accusing me of stealing money from the cash register and
38:42
then the manager believing and then arguing and fighting about that.
38:49
So, I don’t…I think things that I saw I stood up for, but then saying
38:56
you know why would you do that?
38:57
You know why would I even…I mean there ridiculous as they’re saying well, she
39:01
went all the way into the warehouse and took the money and came out.
39:05
I don’t…so even I Tillamook I you know once I experienced that I don’t…I didn’t
39:13
go back and give my business to them.
39:15
SO stuff like that of it and I think for that I feel like I’ve always
39:20
and even my sister we’ve always stood you know stood up for that.
39:27
But the few things where the self-esteem piece was where, you know, you were made
39:34
to feel like you weren’t good enough.
39:38
And for whatever reason you know because I think it doesn’t matter
39:41
what race or gender or color you are I think when you are young right?
39:46
Whther it’s high school or what not we all have
39:52
hopes of somebody liking you or you like someone but there were kids I there who
39:57
really knew how to burst your bubbles, you know, so like for example there’d
40:01
be like, there was a girl who asked me hey are you, are you gonna ask anybody
40:08
for the Sadie Hawkins dance and I was like no, I’m not planning to go and she
40:12
will be like well, good I don’t think anybody would go with you anyways and
40:16
I be like, even though you’re like what it’s still affects your mentality, right?
40:21
Then I’m like no one’s gonna ask you because you’re too tall.
40:25
You know so I was really good, the wit of it coming really quick and sharp
40:31
tongue and then she would be like well, why would you sat that and I would be
40:34
like well, why would you say that to me?
40:37
You know and I still remember her face and I still know her I mean don’t know
40:42
her but I know who she is and all.
40:45
But those, that’s how they would kind of jab and then even though you
40:49
are trying not to let it bother you.
40:51
So you, but then you bring that with you, right?
40:54
So, I brought that with me in college so even someone asked me.
40:58
I’m like why he is asking me there must be something going on you
41:02
know I want nothing to do with it.
41:04
And I just ignore and just let it go.
41:07
You know, for years until someone just hit me over the head and just say do just
41:12
think someone wants to go out with you because they like you but ti affects, you
41:16
know, you remember and hear those voices like no one wants to go out with you
41:21
because, you know, you’re dark and you’re
41:25
not from here Why would you go?
41:27
So yeah, so I don’t know if I explained that?
41:28
Yeah, I think you did.
41:29
It’s all so complicated, you know?
41:30
I know, yeah.
41:32
Oh,
41:41
I wanted to ask you when you were in Tillamook did…were you embracing
41:46
your culture then…both cultures?
41:48
Or was it later…how have you found that balance because those
41:52
are two very different cultures?
41:53
It is.
41:53
So, when we were growing up if we didn’t bring the spices and all with us
42:01
from Nepal, there was no place to buy.
42:03
Well, there was no place to buy in Tillamook and there really wasn’t
42:06
much in Portland either until, I think, until later in the 80s,
42:13
you know, there, and I think there was like one Indian store
42:16
that opened up in Portland.
42:18
So, when we were, so basically we really grew up with like meat and potato.
42:22
You know, even though we were craving for, you know, curry, excuse me,
42:26
spices and stuff, we really grew up and my guardian mom and dad didn’t eat
42:31
spicy stuff, so we really grew up in a household where, you know, one day
42:38
hamburgers, another day steak and one day hot dog wrapped in the bacon, right?
42:45
So, there really was kind of like a menu of what we were gonna have when.
42:51
So that’s what we grew up with and like I say even though we craved curry, we
42:56
didn’t have it, and then also it was very less likely for us to cook because
43:02
the guardian dad and mom did not like it so and it was small kitchen with no
43:06
windows so the times that we did cook is when, if they were gone on conferences or
43:12
gone for the weekend then we would cook and then make sure that the house is,
43:18
the house was, you know, aired out and all and then.
43:22
But then once, or if we went to a Nepalese family’s home up in Portland for a
43:28
day then they would cook and feed us.
43:30
So,
43:34
I think all of us did not
43:38
we were aware of our culture and language but when I first came
43:47
because I need to learn the English, my guardian mom, is like you’re not speaking.
43:53
Now, I get now the negative aspects of that, right?
43:57
So what she basically told my sisters like if she talks to
44:02
you guys in Nepali do not talk.
44:04
She needs to learn English so she needs to ask you questions, right?
44:08
So again being here a new language, a new place even my siblings, you know, if I
44:15
would say something in Nepali, they’d just ignore me until I struggled in asking in
44:19
English so I think that’s why I learned the language quick so I didn’t have to be
44:24
held back, but the flipside of it now when I think about it, because I really forgot
44:32
how to read and write because I knew how to read and write Nepali when I came.
44:35
Had I kept up with that I think I would have been fine now.
44:40
I can read little bit like first grade now, but I, I can write my name and couple
44:45
sentences like how are you and few things but not formal or fluently I can write.
44:53
So, I have forgotten my language, and all of that until, and then before
44:59
my freshman year in college is when my guardian mom is like, you know
45:03
what you need to know your language.
45:06
It was like okay so I was sent back to Nepal for a summer for three months
45:11
and then we hired a tutor to teach me and it was intensive language class,
45:18
so the language, you know, I had learn you’re telling me forget but now I’m
45:23
learning so now I can speak Nepali but not in that formal way so when I meet
45:30
like a large group of Nepalese people it takes me a while to warm up in speaking
45:35
you know otherwise I am mixing English and Nepali together so when we were in
45:41
Tillamook I think we really got back to you know doing like the celebrations
45:50
and like brothers’ days and different events that we have with our religion.
45:54
I think once my sisters, older sisters, had their own place then we started but we
46:01
didn’t do that when we were in Tillamook.
46:04
And again I think a mixture of it there wasn’t things to buy and do.
46:09
As well as, I was, we weren’t sure it may have been received by our
46:15
guardian mom and dad, you know, as much as they did really great things
46:18
for Nepal and all of that I think they were still white Americans, right?
46:24
So, and their beliefs were different so
46:30
we started doing a lot of the stuff, you know, practicing our religion and
46:34
doing all that once, I’d say once I was a freshman in college and by then my
46:42
sister had her own place and all that so we were able to do some of that.
46:47
And none of it was lost?
46:49
No, I think that’s one good thing about it.
46:51
It didn’t.
46:53
None of us forgot or lost it.
46:56
And I think, and as we got older and all I would have to say that the one person
47:03
who keeps it all together for us is one of our, she’s number 3 in the family,
47:10
so she’s the one and she’s religious.
47:13
She prays and does everything every day, and she remembers what we need
47:18
to do when so I think she’s the one who has kinda kept us all together in
47:24
what we need to do and we, you know, my sister, we’ve talked about it.
47:28
It’s like if she ever, if something ever happens and she ever passes, I
47:32
don’t if like I will continue to that level, I don’t know, I think I will.
47:38
I would do my prayers and stuff but I don’t know if I would at that level and
47:42
you know with certain celebrations all you have to certain food and all I don’t know
47:49
the recipes and how to make it, you know.
47:51
She knows and my mom knows.
47:53
So, and then we count on her to do that so I would say she has been the key person
48:01
in keeping us all in the, in line of doing that, but none of us, you know were not
48:07
resistant to it but I think there’s always different roles that each siblings plays
48:12
and I think for that’s what she plays for us and you know because there’s a
48:19
lot mores of do and don’ts in our culture I feel like versus in western culture
48:24
you know so even like if somebody passes there’s rules of you know what you need
48:28
to do within the first 7 days, first 45 days and a year and she’s true believer
48:35
in doing that you know like during month of our Dashain celebration month of like
48:42
usually it falls in October she won’t allow anyone to bring beef into the house.
48:48
She won’t eat beef, and if, and we respect her and we don’t do that but if
48:56
we just joke with her, she gets really mad you know so even if we’re going out
48:59
she’s say why do you have to have beef?
49:03
We’re like we just want a burger you know and she gets so mad so that’s why I
49:07
think she had kept it for us but yeah, I don’t know how much of it we, I would do
49:16
but I think for all of us the, because the culture and the religion is so tied
49:21
together that’s never gonna go away.
49:26
And do I understand correctly, your mom came?
49:29
When did she come?
49:30
My mom came in the early 90s, late 80s.
49:35
Early 90s once my sister married and had her green card.
49:39
So my mom, both my mom and dad we’re sponsored under her.
49:42
So, yeah.
49:43
Okay.
49:45
And you’re a citizen now?
49:46
Is that correct?
49:47
Yeah, I’m a citizen now.
49:48
When did you become a citizen?
49:49
Oh my gosh, I think in the late - so I started working here in ’95
49:56
with H1 visa and I think I was able to do that for seven years.
50:00
So that would bring me to 2002, right?
50:03
So, I think around 2002, 2003 is when I got my green card.
50:08
And then a few years later I got my citizenship so in the mid-2000s.
50:14
What sparked you getting your green card?
50:16
Was it that you had to?
50:17
Or was it a choice?
50:20
No, I had to because when I worked here I had the H1B visa because I was
50:26
still considered international student.
50:28
And so that was, I think, it was like a four year and three year or
50:32
something like that that you could.
50:35
And my mom was a green card holder already, but if I didn’t - so she
50:42
had already applied for me for my paperwork but because she’s a green
50:46
card holder it takes a lot longer versus if you are a US citizen.
50:50
And so, and I was also trying through the VISA lottery.
50:54
I was doing that but - and we also tried through work, but being that, you know,
50:59
it was much harder to try and get it through work so and my thing was like
51:06
you know this is what I know here.
51:08
I mean, I grew up here even though I have 9 years of my time in Nepal.
51:13
This what I knew.
51:15
So for - and everybody was here.
51:17
You know, my immediate family was here so for me it was like what, you know, what
51:23
would I, what would happen if I went home?
51:26
You know, I don’t have the writing skill.
51:29
My speaking, Nepalese speaking skill was at minimum at that time.
51:33
Newari was fine but that wasn’t the national language you know that everybody
51:38
spoke so it was this stressful and nerve-wracking to say what do I do?
51:46
And my mom didn’t really want to become a US citizen you know because she
51:50
didn’t want to give up her Nepalese citizen and I didn’t force her.
51:55
Mom don’t worry, let’s see if I can get DV lottery and all and she didn’t want
52:00
to, but it came to a point where okay if I don’t then she’s gonna go home so
52:07
she’s like okay, I’ll get the citizenship so she - soon as she got the citizenship
52:13
then that would put my, not only mine but my other sisters, too, application to,
52:19
you know, at a faster rate of getting.
52:21
So, she did that which was a you know for me I feel bad for her.
52:28
You know and I know she did that for me, but for long time, I know, I’m sure
52:36
even when she went to do that she did not want to do that she did not want
52:38
to give up her citizenship, Nepalese citizenship, so she got her citizenship
52:45
and the day I got letter from immigration about, you know, your green card is
52:51
approved through your mom is the same day I got a letter DVD/ DV/ lottery, VISA
52:58
lottery, saying hey, you got the lottery.
53:00
Oh, that makes it more painful.
53:02
Right, yeah, so then I’m like oh my gosh if it was just one year apart you know
53:06
with getting the DV lottery one year before my mom then at least she could
53:11
maintain her green card and you know her citizenship so that was the same I got
53:17
both of the letters of it and so, you know, it’s like what a waste of, you know,
53:22
could I give this to somebody else and you know of course it’s not a transferable
53:27
one but yeah that’s so how became citizen.
53:33
So green card and then the mid-2000s is when I went in and got my citizenship.
53:39
And we’ve talked before and I know that I think you said that Nepal
53:44
doesn’t allow you to have dual, right?
53:46
Yeah.
53:47
But your sister who’s British?
53:49
Is that right?
53:50
Or?
53:51
Oh, I have a sister who lives in Britain and she was able to do a dual.
53:57
I can’t remember.
53:58
No, no, she has a British passport, too.
54:00
Oh, ok, all right.
54:02
Yeah, she has a British passport, too, So.
54:07
I think none of us have Nepalese passport anymore.
54:11
My siblings.
54:13
We all have.
54:15
That must have been really hard for your mom.
54:18
Yeah, I think it was.
54:19
Yeah, I didn’t push too much on it but I know it was a hard for her because you
54:24
know, I think my other sister talking to her of saying mom you know because she
54:30
was like well the paperwork is already in through my green card, you know for
54:34
her it’ll come and I think one of my sisters saying like mom, that takes
54:39
a lot longer kinda explaining, but if you did citizenship then that would
54:44
that means within a month her paperwork because she’s already in the system not
54:49
only my paperwork but my other siblings’ paperwork went through too because it
54:53
was my two, my sister and a brother and that what and I think for her it was just
55:03
I think of guilt like if I don’t do it then they’re gonna go, right?
55:06
Go home.
55:08
Whether it’s guilt and all so yeah, it’s a mixed feeling of it.
55:13
I’m appreciative but at the same time the guilt.
55:16
That
55:18
in a position that we put her in.
55:21
Where she shouldn’t have been put in that position, you know because you
55:25
know she was in her 50s if she wanted to keep she should be allowed to do that
55:30
but I think the circumstances and all had where she had to make a choice and
55:35
it may not have been the best choice that she wanted to make but I think she
55:39
sacrificed in doing that for her kids.
55:43
And there was another factor, the rules, you know, that- it wasn’t as much,
55:48
you guys as it was the institution
55:53
behind it.
55:53
Let me check.
55:54
We’re at 3:10.
55:55
No, we can go for a little bit.
55:55
You’re all right?
55:56
Yeah, that’s fine.
55:57
OK.
55:57
Let me look here.
56:00
We did the citizenship.
56:02
Do you feel American now?
56:05
How do you feel about, did it change anything when you got your piece of paper?
56:10
You know, growing up from age nine on I think I consider myself more western.
56:19
Yeah, western, westernized, I think, because this is what I knew you know.
56:26
I mean I think the people and community and others will remind you that you are
56:32
different and you are not from here for whatever reason but I think being brought
56:37
up in Tillamook and here and I’ve lived the majority of my time here in Corvallis.
56:42
I do feel westernized.
56:44
And I think even in my reactions and all sometimes it reminds me that I’m western,
56:54
but at the same time I haven’t’ forgotten where I’m from and you know haven’t
57:02
forgotten of you know of growing up poor, you know, growing up not having food
57:08
every day and watching my mom and dad work hard and you know all of us even when I
57:16
have 7, 8 years old working and figuring out how do I make a quick buck right so
57:22
all of that reminds, so I didn’t forget that part and all of us remember that
57:27
and the struggles of not having anything
57:32
going hungry and sleeping without food much and all of that and so I remember all
57:39
of that but I think my upbringing in terms of from 9 on is with the western view of
57:49
it and I don’t know how to explain that because and I think like I said when I
57:56
went back to Nepal in 2013 I went and my brother who went earlier had given me a
58:04
warning saying you know don’t go with this thought of what Nepal was when you were,
58:11
when you left in 2000, you know, in 1979 because that is almost like a Shangri-La
58:18
you know it’s not there so when you go, go with foreigners eyes you know like
58:24
you’re visiting the country because if you go thinking oh I am going and want, I
58:28
can’t wait to see the house I grew up and he’s like it’s nothing like what it was.
58:32
The home is still there but you know the development and the dirtiness
58:36
and all of that so he’s just, he’s, so I went with that mentality
58:41
of it and thoughts and it was.
58:43
It was like a day and night you know the streets were just able to play and just
58:50
run around and play now you would probably get called because of the amount of cars
58:56
that are there and amount of motorcycles and cars and bus there’s no way you know
59:05
so there was a lot of shockingness but at the same time my thoughts of were in
59:10
terms of the western thoughts of like ok the infrastructure of it how can
59:14
you, you know, make this country into what it once and I had anxiety attacks
59:20
for the first time being there you know just for the fact that from pollution
59:26
to the trash and everything you know so after a while I just did not even think
59:34
about because I was like where is all this trash going you know so here were
59:39
creating trash at home and, but I and then you see the river bed it’s like it’s
59:46
everywhere and kids are walking on it and playing in it dogs are just at it so then
59:51
you’re like there’s nothing, there is nothing that’s creating and you know in
59:58
organizing and getting rid of the trash of it so like so when my aunt tells me
1:00:05
she got up early in the morning to you know sweep the house and get rid of the
1:00:08
trash and I just asked her once, [lowers her voice] where did you take the trash?
1:00:14
And she said oh, I just went and threw it at the next-door neighbor’s
1:00:17
house couple doors down and I was like I don’t want to know!
1:00:22
I don’t want to know!
1:00:23
So after while I just, it was like a blinders.
1:00:26
I had to put blinders on because we were there for a month and it was really,
1:00:31
really sad and you know if I’m in the car and driving and all that’s where
1:00:36
I started, you know, panic attack, panicking of the state of what the
1:00:41
country is and this was pre-earthquake.
1:00:45
So that’s why I think so part of it is I have the mixture of it and I think
1:00:52
with my sisters and me we’ve been able to I don’t know balance it if that makes
1:00:57
sense balance the both worlds of it.
1:01:02
So.
1:01:02
That’s difficult and you pulled it off, yeah?
1:01:05
Yeah, Yeah, I think it is difficult of it you know because
1:01:11
and I know that there are, there are Nepalese who move here and all and who,
1:01:19
and I don’t if the word ethnocentric, and you know there are some - and not
1:01:23
only Nepalese community, too, because there are other communities too where
1:01:26
they’re very ethnocentric and for me that’s not me you know I think if you
1:01:32
are you need to get to know and be you know get to know and be with people from
1:01:38
diverse places and all and so not just be with your own community all the time.
1:01:45
Is there a fairly big community in Oregon?
1:01:46
Yeah, well it’s a fairly big community almost because I think
1:01:51
Oregon, D.C. area, east coast is huge, Canada, Washington, yeah.
1:01:59
And I can’t remember how much but when we first came there was maybe
1:02:05
handful where if there’s a Nepalese get together one house could host us.
1:02:10
Now we have to get a place, a hall to host.
1:02:14
There’s no way one person’s home could host, so it is getting big.
1:02:21
There’s a huge population in D.C. area, too.
1:02:24
Yeah.
1:02:24
And do you participate in that community?
1:02:26
Does you family?
1:02:27
Yeah, Yeah we do, Yeah.
1:02:29
Actually my sister was a Nepalese Association of Oregon
1:02:33
president for last couple years and she just finished her term.
1:02:37
So, yeah, yeah, we participate.
1:02:41
So I think there’s just two more if you feel ok about it.
1:02:45
The other one was asking about how you came to work at EOP and just what was
1:02:52
behind choosing this type of profession?
1:02:55
Yeah.
1:02:56
So my undergrad was in broadcast media communication and then, and I always
1:03:05
say my master’s was not a plan thing, and I would not recommend anyone doing
1:03:10
it the way I did because I literally you know took a little bit over four
1:03:15
years and couple terms to finish my undergrad, so as I’m finishing I was
1:03:22
looking for jobs and all but there was nothing you know in that field and so
1:03:28
and I knew that okay that means I have six months before I would have to go home
1:03:35
so what I was like okay maybe I’ll do my master’s you know
1:03:38
that was literally the thinking.
1:03:40
I’ll do my masters and at that time I had taken some classes in like anthropology
1:03:46
and I think in women’s studies so I think for me a lot of the things happened for
1:03:52
me because of the relationship building I did when I was on campus so I knew
1:03:57
this woman in graduate school and when I went to talk to her really quick she
1:04:03
was, she gave me some ideas like are there faculties who you know and again I
1:04:09
don’t think this will happen this day and time and I said yeah I know a few people
1:04:13
and so I was like okay women’s studies anthropology you know and so I went and
1:04:18
talked to like a professor like Janet at that time a couple other faculties and I
1:04:25
said I’m thinking about doing my master’s in women’s studies do you think you would
1:04:29
support me in coming into that program and then I talked to anthropology so within
1:04:34
like a week I was able to put it together so for women’s studies and they were like
1:04:42
MAIS you just have to do you know three areas so I said okay I’ll do two areas in
1:04:46
women’s studies because I know somebody there taking classes and they know me and
1:04:51
so and they accepted me with anthropology I had taken some classes but I didn’t
1:04:57
have all As or Bs so I had mixture of it so they accepted me in and again from
1:05:03
somebody I know faculty on a probation they said you have one term to show us
1:05:11
that you do, that you can do well in this class so that’s how I put together MAIS.
1:05:17
Now if I was giving a longer time to process what masters make, I
1:05:22
don’t know, would I have chosen different you know path to go.
1:05:26
Maybe, maybe not I don’t know.
1:05:28
But so, I ended up doing like contemporary women’s issues, race, class, gender
1:05:33
and then cultural anthropology was my MAIS so when I was - I did
1:05:39
that and then first and I took a little bit over two years to finish.
1:05:44
I had the scholarship through the foundation, American Nepal Education
1:05:49
Foundation and then I think for part of it I was because it was beyond
1:05:57
the time I wasn’t going to get the scholarship I would get stipend but
1:06:02
then not the tuition so that’s when I just happened to meet Janet because we
1:06:07
were on committee, search committee, and I was conference director a summer
1:06:14
conference director so and I was just chatting with her and I just said hey,
1:06:18
you know, I’m losing my funding starting fall do you know anywhere you know they
1:06:24
may hire for graduate students and all.
1:06:28
But that spring I was graduate student with women studies, so and that was
1:06:35
just a short term and that’s when she said oh, yeah we hire graduate students.
1:06:40
I said, oh great can I get the application, applied it and then
1:06:45
- which was towards end of summer and then they called me in for interview
1:06:49
and then I was given a graduate.
1:06:51
SO that’s how I ended up in EOP is through Janet’s connection and then came here
1:06:56
and did one year graduate you know GTA and then again as I was looking for jobs
1:07:05
and all that there really wasn’t much but and then, the director at that time,
1:07:09
Larry Griggs, like we have a position open if you’d like to apply we’d encourage
1:07:15
you to apply and so again it was like okay do I just say no and just go home
1:07:21
and figure things out or do I take something so I can start earning money
1:07:25
and so for me I’m like okay you know I need to apply so I applied was offered
1:07:31
a job in fall of ’95 and so that’s how I came here and I think for me, I mean, my
1:07:42
road to getting a master’s was very unconventional because again
1:07:48
I said I don’t think it would happen now this day and time of it.
1:07:52
And the other part was I chose fields that didn’t require GRE by the way
1:07:56
because at that time GRE was required and I was like there’s no time for
1:08:01
me to do so which ones are those.
1:08:03
SO that’s how why I said you know for me and I tell students this all the time,
1:08:07
too is like the importance of building relationship because you don’t know
1:08:11
when somebody can assist you or you can assist them and for me I feel like I
1:08:16
had in different areas somebody who was supporting me and who understood me and
1:08:23
wanted to go that extra mile to make sure that I was aware and helping me.
1:08:28
And I feel like women’s studies and faculties there as well as
1:08:32
anthropology and my grad rep who was in college education.
1:08:36
I think all of them came together in helping me in this and then at the
1:08:43
time of the need when you know I feel like EOP was here to help me you know
1:08:48
providing me with the H1B vise which I will always be very appreciative.
1:08:54
And fortunate of it so and giving me that opportunity and so and you know and
1:09:01
working as a graduate student for one year and just transiting into the job I
1:09:06
don’t, I know that my degree wasn’t geared toward this you know I don’t know what
1:09:13
it’s geared towards but this just fell in my lap and then you know I enjoyed
1:09:19
working with students and the support of the faculties and staff up here and the
1:09:26
work they do so it just became my career.
1:09:32
Yeah, I don’t think I would have ever thought of it, of this so because when
1:09:38
I did my masters I did that just to stay here, to extend my stay and I’m
1:09:44
like I’ll worry about it in few years.
1:09:47
But eventually you know working here and the support and
1:09:51
everything that was given here.
1:09:54
I would say it became my career and twenty two years later I’m still here.
1:09:59
Yeah.
1:10:03
So my last one sorta jumps back out away from EOP and you know, I had to write a
1:10:09
lot of word to makes these [questions] make sense, but how do you, what is your
1:10:16
- you know what I’m trying to ask, yeah?
1:10:18
[she nods] So like
1:10:21
with it being historically, racism, being such a black, white issue how do you
1:10:27
feel like as someone who immigrated here
1:10:32
who isn’t black or white.
1:10:33
How do you feel like your voice fits into that
1:10:38
talk?
1:10:38
And I’ve been thinking about this, too.
1:10:40
Okay, you knew what I was talking about?
1:10:41
Yeah, yeah.
1:10:41
I just hoped that I explained it well.
1:10:41
Yeah, so
1:10:46
I think first part it doesn’t matter what part of the world you are in I
1:10:50
think everybody makes sure that black is bad whether it’s color or what not
1:10:57
that is the worst of the worst to be.
1:10:59
And I think for lot of us who
1:11:05
may not get that historical right that relationship of black and white and
1:11:10
the racism of here in the United States who don’t get that and then you’re
1:11:14
just getting the information about this is good or that’s bad and all.
1:11:19
Sometimes you buy into that.
1:11:22
Because again like I said you know there is no reason there is no reason
1:11:28
to be selling skin lightening medication or cream or whatever they call it.
1:11:34
I don’t think there’s reason for it, but I think there, the message is that
1:11:39
you know that dark skin is not good.
1:11:41
So you need to have porcelain white skin and that’s the advertisements
1:11:45
it and I know people here who buy at the Indian stores and use it
1:11:51
you know my sister tried it once and she almost burned her skin off.
1:11:58
What does it do?
1:12:00
It’s very chemical.
1:12:01
I mean you paste it on and you leave it but you can burn your skin
1:12:07
so and my sister was trying it.
1:12:11
And for me I am always like I don’t know why you’re doing it and again and this is
1:12:16
one of the sisters who came when she was 19 and didn’t speak much English so you
1:12:22
know for her, her understanding level in all this is little bit, still at where
1:12:28
ours is so for her she sees something she’s very gullible and she’ll buy it.
1:12:33
You just have to say it does this.
1:12:35
It could be a hundred dollars and so we really, we really have to
1:12:38
watch her you know and be like no you’re not going to spend that money
1:12:42
because she’ll go but it does this.
1:12:44
No!
1:12:45
So, you know for her when she sees it she says like well it says it
1:12:48
evens out the skin tone and as you get older you have age spots.
1:12:53
She so put it on one my sister, right?
1:12:55
And it almost burned her face off.
1:12:58
And I was like you know so I think so you’re taught that so when you come to
1:13:03
US and because in Nepal we really didn’t see as much African Americans you know
1:13:11
the nine years I was there because my dad would drive a tourist tour, you
1:13:17
know, he was a driver for tourists in hotels and all so we really majority
1:13:22
of people were from Europe, US but during the 70s there wasn’t many African
1:13:31
Americans coming so we didn’t even know.
1:13:34
Only thing we knew was the pictures or what we were told.
1:13:37
And again like
1:13:40
whatever the message the westerners wanted us to have about African Americans
1:13:45
and I think so when you come here you already have those information, right?
1:13:52
Then you are making your decision based on what you have heard not
1:13:56
what you know or getting to know.
1:13:58
So, I think so with that I think
1:14:04
for me I know that in combination with what the kids were telling me in
1:14:11
school and pitting us against and all that was one of things they would you
1:14:15
know they would be saying but like I said when I came as a 17 year old
1:14:20
my intention was, I was just happy to be in a place that had more than
1:14:27
you know more than white students.
1:14:29
And then from the moment I walked into McNary Hall we had - you know
1:14:35
my roommate was Korean American,
1:14:41
and our neighbor was Mexican American with an African American roommate so we really
1:14:46
got to have this, this international flavor to the group that we we had.
1:14:54
And the other part also then you have that of where you know Asians are put
1:15:03
on the pedestal of all the races right?
1:15:06
The Asians are so then you’re like oh, ok so I’m accepted into this white
1:15:15
community but you know and we’re better than and I think hearing all of that
1:15:23
in midst of it I think I would have to say our voices probably does get lost
1:15:29
but at the same time within the topic of racism and all and when African
1:15:34
Americans are talking they’re talking and representing and supporting of
1:15:40
all races so when there’s incidents happening and all they’re not just
1:15:44
talking about you know this is the right we have we need and support but when
1:15:50
they’re doing that they’re speaking for all the other races, too, I feel.
1:15:56
[.] And so I don’t know
1:16:01
if I’m getting to where you are asking me?
1:16:04
Yeah, I think you are.
1:16:05
I’m kinda curious do you feel that - I wish I could figure out to ask it best.
1:16:16
So it to me, it sounds like you do feel included in the conversation?
1:16:21
I do.
1:16:22
Yeah.
1:16:22
Yeah, I would say I do.
1:16:24
Yeah, that’s what I was going for.
1:16:24
Like as an immigrant and yeah, trying to figure out where your voice is in that.
1:16:32
Yeah, yeah I think I do and then you know being and working here at
1:16:36
EOP there’s been few incidents where I’ve been part of where you know
1:16:44
the very first incident I remember when I was working here was a young male
1:16:48
that I was - young African American male who I was working with who was
1:16:52
experiencing some racism in terms of being urinated on firecrackers thrown
1:16:58
out at you know so and then you know the marches and stuff that we partook in.
1:17:05
and seeing how all students came together to support that and then the changes that
1:17:11
was requested through the administrations and all and I think and I know that and
1:17:20
I don’t know if this helping in answering the question or not but I think if there
1:17:25
are times when I have experienced some incidents or something has happened I
1:17:33
know I feel like I can go and you know and talk to my peers and then talk to them and
1:17:38
get their support and even now I’m very
1:17:50
- I share if there’s things going on and all this is what happened if there’s
1:17:53
an incident that took place with me or my sisters up in Portland or what not.
1:17:58
I share.
1:17:59
I say this is what’s going on because I think part of it is
1:18:02
just letting people be aware.
1:18:04
Now some people know how to react to that or what to say others don’t know you know
1:18:09
or some may not agree in how you responded but I think my sisters are same way in
1:18:17
doing that, not all of them but I know for example and I don’t know if I told you.
1:18:23
I had a sister and my mom - my sisters they drove to Idaho you know during that
1:18:28
fire and all to our cousins house and they had stopped somewhere in Idaho just
1:18:34
to take a break potty break and all.
1:18:37
And it was like a grocery store some sort of a store and I don’t know how
1:18:43
out there they were they stopped and so my sister stopped there and asked the
1:18:47
woman who was working outside organizing fruits and stuff saying excuse me ma’am
1:18:52
do you have a restroom and you know here’s four women of color and she’s
1:18:57
like you’ve got to go two blocks down to that store to use the restroom.
1:19:01
My sister’s like this is a big grocery store so she went in and asked the person
1:19:10
in there inside by the cashier who was a person of color and said excuse me ma’am
1:19:16
do you have a restroom she says oh yeah it’s in the corner back there right.
1:19:19
So my sister went and did her business.
1:19:22
And when she came back she goes excuse me I must be in Trump town because you
1:19:29
must have supported Trump and I’m in Trump town because you told me that
1:19:33
there was no restroom in this you know in this store and shame on you and
1:19:39
then the lady was like well, I didn’t know what you were asking and you know
1:19:42
my sister you knew exactly what I was asking . So, you are a Trump supporter
1:19:47
who so whatever else and I wish I knew exactly what she said and because she
1:19:51
called me and told me that and that woman flustered and went away you know so those
1:19:56
[unintelligible] you know and then we share it because who knows who’s gonna go.
1:20:01
You know to that place again and all but I think overall my voice is heard.
1:20:07
Yeah, I think that was sort of…
1:20:09
Yeah.
1:20:09
What I was going for, for that question.
1:20:12
Is there anything else that you would like to add that you’ve
1:20:15
thought of as we’ve talked or…
1:20:18
I think I covered it.
1:20:20
Do you have any questions to clarify anything?
1:20:23
No, this is really good.
1:20:24
I wish that I could ask my questions better and…
1:20:29
Oh, no.
1:20:29
I think that’s fine.
1:20:30
…and this all part of learning for me so thank you for letting
1:20:33
me try to learn with you.
1:20:34
Yeah not a problem.
1:20:36
Hopefully if you need any clarification let me know
1:20:38
Yeah once I start to transcribe things are a little bit different,
1:20:42
the way you hear it differently.
1:20:44
I might want to ask you some more questions.
1:20:45
Yeah, that’s fine.
1:20:46
You’d be ok with it?
1:20:46
Yeah, yeah, that’s fine.
1:20:47
All right.
1:20:48
Call it?
1:20:49
Yeah.
1:20:49
All right.
