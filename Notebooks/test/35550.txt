00:03
My name is Joe Nunn and we’re gathered today to have an interview with the
00:08
St. Philip the Deacon Episcopal Church members and those that were tied into the
00:15
history of the Urban League in Portland.
00:18
And many of us as church members know that the history of Portland and dealing
00:24
with discrimination and civil rights was closely tied into St. Philips
00:29
Church and to Father Stone and the leadership that he not only took part of
00:34
but also helped develop and encourage.
00:37
So Oregon State Archive Library is graciously agreed to keep our church’s
00:44
history alive for students and future students who will go to Oregon State
00:50
and study the history of Oregon.
00:53
And just like in other cultures we do not want this history to be lost.
00:57
There’s many people that fought the battles that are not here today and
01:01
so those of us that are here are going to tell their story and they fought
01:06
very hard to make sure that we could be here today to tell this story.
01:11
So we’re going to introduce everybody; my name again, is Joe Nunn and I was
01:16
a former altar boy in the church, grew up in the church and became
01:23
a public school teacher like my grandfather, my father, and my mother.
01:28
And Gerry Caldwell will begin introducing himself and his profession
01:35
and we’ll start the interview.
01:38
I’m Gerry Caldwell, lifelong member of the church.
01:41
I’m 72 years old.
01:44
I grew up in the church, I was a life-long member.
01:49
I was born August 17, 1940.
01:52
September 19th my mother bundled me up, brought me into church and said, “We need
01:57
to put some water on him, he’s going to need it” [laugher] . So I was baptized.
02:03
I grew up and became a banker.
02:07
In my younger banker years I spent a lot of time with the Urban League; they
02:13
were always trying to get me to join and become an officer and the bank was taking
02:20
up too much of my time to do that, but I did support them and all their functions.
02:28
And if it had not been for Father Stone, I probably wouldn’t have
02:33
gotten a job as a banker, I probably would have been sweeping streets.
02:37
But he told me to go talk to the manager, Union Grand of the branch
02:43
and he sent me downtown to talk to a gentleman and there were twelve people
02:49
there interviewing for a position and everyone when in there for the
02:53
interview got their packets to fill out.
02:56
I was called in; gentleman said “Oh, did Father Stone send you down here?”
03:01
I said, “Yes, sir” He said, “Can you start Monday?” [laughter] . So,
03:07
that was my introduction to the world of banking.
03:10
It wasn’t what you knew, it was who you knew.
03:12
And Gerry, how many years did you spend in the air force?
03:16
In the army?
03:17
In the army, yes.
03:17
Twenty eight total years in the military.
03:21
And all that time I was a member of the church here and I remember back when I
03:30
was an acolyte and the things we did.
03:34
And when the church had a balcony in it and when the altar boy, the acolyte,
03:41
would change the numbers for the hymns, I always wanted to do that but the got rid
03:47
of the balcony before I could do that.
03:52
So this church has more history and Father Stone was a real forward thinking
03:58
individual and he made things happen.
04:01
And him and several others: Shelly Hill, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Ford, who was one of the
04:11
first black teachers in the city, and Mrs. Stone who was a teacher also, they
04:17
really laid the groundwork so that I can feel that I can walk the streets
04:24
and hold my head up proud these days, and I’ve taken up enough of your time.
04:29
Thank you.
04:30
Allison.
04:31
I’m Allison Logan Belcher and my husband and I and family have been
04:35
members of St. Philips since 1967.
04:39
We moved into the neighborhood and a long time belief in the rights
04:45
of all people in this country.
04:47
I had lived in the South when I was younger and my father was in the Navy, and
04:53
I saw discrimination and it appalled me.
04:57
At Oregon State when I was there I also saw acts of discrimination
05:02
against people of color, not just blacks, but people who were Asian.
05:07
To me it’s extremely important for all of us to realize that people need the chance
05:14
and opportunity to have freedom of choice.
05:19
I also believe that Father Stone was almost god-like [laughter] , in fact,
05:24
my daughter used to call him “God Stone” because she thought he was God.
05:30
He visited the community, he visited me in our home, and my feelings
05:36
about the discrimination in our country started when my parents
05:40
began educating me as a small child.
05:43
I saw discrimination in Portland when we moved here, where blacks were having to
05:48
sit in the upper parts of the theaters, they weren’t allowed to live in certain
05:53
neighborhoods, and it appalled me.
05:56
We joined St. Philips because it’s one of the closets churches to us
06:01
and I’m very happy to have been with this church and this group of people;
06:06
I consider them my dear friends and I am happy to be here today.
06:11
Thank you Allison.
06:12
Geoffrey.
06:14
My name is Geoffrey Brooks; I’m 65 years old.
06:19
I was raised in this church along with Joe Nunn, we go back.
06:25
I think the unusual thing about us, all of us who grew up in our generation in
06:33
this church, we’re all still friends.
06:35
I think that that’s very unusual, that’s sort of a side note.
06:41
Being a member of St. Philips church, having been baptized
06:44
in this church, having known
06:50
- I’m almost getting a little emotional, sorry about that – I’d already known Gerry
06:55
Caldwell; his family lived around the corner from my mom and dad, way back in
07:02
the ‘50s, and I was just a little tyke.
07:05
Mr. Amerson,
07:09
all of the elders who are sitting at the table, these are the
07:12
people that we grew up with.
07:15
Coming to St. Philips Church taught us how to be young
07:21
people, responsible young people.
07:23
I think the unique aspect of St. Philips Church is we went to a
07:28
church where we had African American people who were professionals,
07:32
whether they we bankers, or lawyers,
07:37
doctors, dentists.
07:41
That was unusual but it was everyday common for us, and I think we were
07:46
unique and blessed in that regard to having to be in this place in this time.
07:55
Sometimes we don’t recognize the impact of that until you actually grow up.
08:00
Like Joe, and like many of the other people sitting at the table, I
08:06
entered public service as a teacher.
08:09
And so my mentors were Joe’s mom and dad, my own father, who was director of
08:17
the Urban League during Model Cities, James Brooks, my mother, who recently
08:22
passed away, was one of the first black members of the school district advisory
08:27
board when they were considering busing and busing black children to white
08:33
neighborhoods, you know, all of that.
08:38
I think what again is significant is about this church is that it is always
08:45
immersed in social activism or political activism in some form or fashion.
08:52
Not that other black churches or other multicultural or multiracial churches
08:57
were not, but this is something that in terms of our history, we
09:03
would like to continue to recognize.
09:08
In preparation for today I brought this book, which I will allow you to take
09:15
with you but I want back, it’s called The Cornerstones of the Community: Buildings
09:21
of Portland’s African American History.
09:25
In this book we looked at homes where black people lived, sometimes in places
09:33
where they were not allowed to live.
09:37
Mr. Amerson is in this book, I believe Gerry Caldwell is in this
09:41
book, my mom’s house is in this book.
09:46
So part of the narrative about St. Philips and African American in north and
09:50
northeast Portland is contained in this book, so I’ll just leave this with you.
09:54
I also brought a CD which has pictures of members of the
09:58
church including my mom and dad.
10:00
But one of the most significant pieces on this CD is a PDF file called the
10:06
“History of African Americans from 1809 to the Present” - that ends about
10:12
1992. But again, all the stories about north and northeast Portland including
10:17
Urban Renewal, which I euphemistically call “the first wave of gentrification
10:24
in this neighborhood.” But you are welcome to take this with you.
10:27
I also have other documentation and pictures, which if we make a
10:31
connection later, I can share with you.
10:34
And I guess I’ll just stop there.
10:38
And Geoffrey of course was a teacher like me and we always believe in
10:43
teaching our students the history of their neighborhood, the real history.
10:47
So, the teacher’s still in you, Geoffrey.
10:51
It’s still there.
10:52
Herb, you are next.
10:56
My name is Herbert Amerson and I’m a member of St. Philips and
11:05
I think I’m going to talk about one of the greatest organizations
11:13
that hit this city and made it
11:25
accept black folks, and that’s the Urban League.
11:28
I don’t know how many of you really knew Shelly Hill but I think Shelly
11:38
was a, I can’t think of another term, but a “shrewd operator” [laugher]
11:46
. Shelly knew everyone, everybody in this city that was worth knowing.
11:58
And he managed to get us on jobs that we couldn’t have had and
12:09
wouldn’t have had without his help.
12:16
He
12:19
introduced you to
12:23
the business side of this city and where the money came from
12:32
and how you get that money.
12:36
And he was very good at what he did.
12:39
I remember a story he used to tell: that
12:45
he was at some white school then and he, a little boy asked him, he told
12:55
the kids that there were many people in this city, black folks, that
12:59
didn’t have a dishwasher, and one kid asked why didn’t have dishwasher,
13:07
and he said “Daddy’s the dishwasher”
13:11
and it always went over so
13:15
big [laughter]
13:19
. It was really a pleasure to work with Shelly and I had the opportunity
13:25
to serve as chair of the Board two consecutive years and I had a chance to
13:36
meet Jordan, and I know you don’t know him but he was the lawyer for Clinton.
13:44
So this is Vernon Jordan?
13:46
Vernon Jordan.
13:48
And he had a good story to tell.
13:50
Jordan went to St. Johns and he worked for the guy that
14:00
- what did he do?
14:00
- I think that he,
14:03
during the civil rights meeting, some black kids tried to go on his
14:09
business and he threw chairs at them or something of that nature.
14:14
Anyway,
14:17
Jordan worked with this man because Jordan’s mother was a
14:25
caterer, in the catering in business.
14:28
So, he was waiting on the tables, he worked with his mother, and this man, I
14:37
wish I could call his name, I know all of you know him, came in that day to dinner
14:44
and he sat down and he told his wife,
14:49
when he came in Jordan was looking at his law practice, he was a lawyer, and
14:53
he was looking at his books, and he said “What are you doing” and Jordan
14:59
said, “ I was just looking at your books, reading some of your books” and
15:03
when Jordan waited on him, bought his dinner, he said, told his wife, “Jordan
15:13
can read.” And Jordan wrote a book, and the name of the book is Jordan Can Read.
15:21
You should read it.
15:22
It’s very interesting.
15:29
Jordan Can Read, there’s the book.
15:31
It’s a good book; it’s a good read, if you have the time.
15:37
I got a chance to introduce him to Oregon, and he and I went to California
15:41
together for a meeting, and it’s an interesting person to be with.
15:48
Then years later I was on the Board again and it was time to get a new director.
16:02
Van, who was a funeral director here, and Jim Thompson, and I had to, I was
16:11
the chairman of the Board, so we had to elect a director and I appointed
16:22
Geoffrey Brooks, I mean
16:26
your dad, James O, James O Brooks as director.
16:32
James went to RiverForest and he went to
16:41
Oregon University.
16:42
I knew he was qualified to be a director and he did, he was a good director.
16:50
I
16:53
stayed with the Urban League until Shelly passed away, and
17:02
the Urban League lost its people, and it lost the people of Portland and
17:12
I don’t think is ever will again be what it was to the city of Portland.
17:19
Thank you.
17:20
Myrtle, your next.
17:23
I think Herb forgot to mention that he was also president of the Board of Directors.
17:28
That’s right, Herb was the president, right.
17:31
And Herb has a document that Vernon Jordan wrote a letter congratulating Herb on his
17:39
appointment and actually came out here and spoke at your appointment ceremony.
17:45
Alright, Myrtle, go ahead.
17:46
Okay, my name is Myrtle Carr.
17:50
I’d like to say that I have been a member of St. Philips since 1949
17:58
and I will get into that regarding Father Stone.
18:02
When I came out here I motored out here from Cleveland, Ohio, because
18:09
I was living in Cleveland but I had relatives who lived out here.
18:13
They had been living here for a few years and they encouraged me to come out here.
18:19
Okay, I go into the Urban League to apply for work and at the
18:25
time Bill Berry was the director, encouraged me to volunteer work.
18:32
I started doing volunteer work and at the time of living in Vancouver,
18:37
Washington, so I had to catch the bus from Vancouver Washington come
18:45
into Portland and at that time a tole bridge was then built from Portland to
18:53
Vancouver, from Vancouver to Portland.
18:57
They paid me 7 ½ a week.
19:00
That was for my car fare.
19:02
$7.50?
19:02
$7.50. So
19:08
the lady who’s position that I
19:14
took over, tried to take over,
19:18
she,
19:23
the position that after she left,
19:28
I moved into her position, but I was not really as qualified as she was.
19:33
And regarding the Urban League, officially the Urban League was
19:41
officially, officially, established in Portland in 1945, but it didn’t open
19:49
its doors until around May 1, 1945.
19:53
And Bill Berry, whom I think was one of the greatest directors we’ve had
19:58
anywhere, he encouraged me and certain areas and I agree with him about
20:07
Shelly but my favorite was Bill Berry.
20:10
I think without Bill Berry there would be so many things that just didn’t happen
20:15
in Portland, because of the hostile racial conditions that existed here.
20:24
And after shipyard, the main things were housing, employment, and
20:30
education, and laws that would pass.
20:35
I remember certain things that happened here that in fact the Urban
20:40
League was housed over the building, a little grease spoon, that said
20:48
“we cater to whites only” and that’s where the Urban League was upstairs.
20:53
I also remember one day we sent a person who came in to apply for work,
21:01
had been a cleaner, had worked at a cleaning establishment in New Orleans.
21:08
When he came back, he was in tears.
21:12
And we said “Well, what happened?”
21:16
and he said, “I didn’t get the job.” So when we called the place where we
21:21
referred the man, they said, “We wanted a cleaner, but we didn’t want him that
21:26
black” [laughter] . So he wasn’t hired.
21:30
So there was a lot of racial tension going on.
21:34
And I would like to say that back to Father Stone, he was also on the board, he
21:41
helped shape Portland to what it is today.
21:47
And also, there was so many notable people coming to...Martin Luther King spoke
21:57
at an Equal Opportunity Day dinner in
22:03
1961; Jackie Robinson stayed with Shelly Hill, he came out in support,
22:08
Carl Roben, Langston Hughes, I had his book but I lost it in the flood.
22:15
So all these things come to mind with me and I think about
22:22
the League in so many ways.
22:25
The leadership is different, even on the national level.
22:30
I had never seen so many smart men in all my life, never, and I don’t
22:35
think I’ll ever see that again.
22:38
I as far as the St. Philips, I served on the Oregon Episcopal Council; I
22:46
was a junior warden, and I also served on the Vestry and it has been very
22:55
rewarding for me to be at the Urban League and also St. Philips church.
23:00
And Myrtle how many years were you at the Urban League?
23:03
I was there for 36 years.
23:04
Okay, and so you described the first the position you held.
23:09
What other positions did you hold there?
23:11
Well, I was the office manager.
23:13
I was the assistant to the, I started out as a secretary trying to replace
23:19
the lady who left, I severed as office manager, assistant to the of the
23:26
employment director, and then I was a job development person when they had this
23:31
program, away from the downtown office.
23:36
And Myrtle, just to get back to back to Bill Berry, I know he was the very
23:41
famous Urban League director in Chicago.
23:44
But I imagine he probably came to St. Philips once in a
23:48
while, in the ‘40s, didn’t he?
23:50
Oh yeah, yes, we had regular meetings here; we used the parish hall so often for
23:57
meeting and for other…areas we wanted to.
24:06
And I know that Bill Berry also spoke with the Mayor of Portland about
24:12
the fact that a lot of these people that were African American were not
24:16
going to be going to the South, that they decided to live in Portland.
24:20
Is that true?
24:21
Yes, because that was the housing problem.
24:25
We had issues with that and we still have it sometimes.
24:28
Okay.
24:28
And Herb, when Myrtle talks about housing issues, could you talk just a little
24:36
about once Vanport flood occurred and then people became more able to buy homes.
24:43
I know we always heard that red lining actually happened but yet,
24:47
many of our leaders in Portland said that it didn’t happen, so can
24:50
you describe Urban League’s part in dealing with the housing discrimination
24:54
and insurance discrimination?
24:56
Well it was rough after the flood because they did red line certain areas that
25:03
blacks couldn’t live, and you couldn’t live there because the loan companies
25:07
wouldn’t give you any money to rent or buy a home a in that particular area.
25:18
That went on for years,
25:21
Yes it did because…
25:23
I don; know who long it was.
25:25
Well you know, yes when we
25:27
Go ahead
25:27
When we moved into Portland in 199- [laughter] and bought a house in 1967 and
25:38
the bank wasn’t going to loan us money, our address is 16th and Stanton,
25:44
because this neighborhood, according to the bank, was going to go downhill
25:49
because of a number of black people that were moving in so the bank
25:55
wasn’t going to loan us any money.
25:56
Fortunately there were many people who worked very hard, xxxxxxx,
26:03
Martha Leisure, to change the attitudes of the people to keep this neighborhood
26:10
safe and to allow people to live here and not red line it, but we were not
26:16
going to be allowed a loan because the neighborhood was going downhill, too
26:22
many black people were living here.
26:24
And we were appalled at the situation and we still wanted to live in
26:28
the neighborhood and as far as I’m concerned it’s a beautiful neighborhood.
26:32
When our children went to school at Irvington, our oldest daughter, who’s
26:36
now 45, about 70% of Irvington grade school was black which was fine with
26:42
my daughter and me and my husband.
26:44
And so it’s been a long battle because I’ve seen gross discrimination
26:50
because I’ve seen it in Portland.
26:53
Go ahead, Herb.
26:53
The percentage of black kids was
26:59
less than 30% because my kids went to Irvington too.
27:07
The discrimination at schools is the thing that caused me to organize
27:17
the Urban Community Association.
27:20
That’s right.
27:21
And it was horrible; it was just unbelievable.
27:26
We used to have music in the schools and when a few blacks
27:31
started they took the music out.
27:34
They took everything out of Irvington School.
27:37
But yet it was still in other schools that had majority white populations.
27:40
Oh yes,
27:45
[?] Go ahead, Myrtle.
27:46
I’d like to say regarding housing I can’t remember it exactly what period,
27:52
but at the time there were 62 census tracks in the city of Portland and
28:00
even though discrimination existed, blacks were living in all of those 62.
28:07
I remember Mr. Ferguson lived out in Lake Oswego years
28:13
and years ago.
28:15
And Geoffrey, the book that you brought refers to some of that red lining.
28:19
Can you talk about how some people got passed all of that?
28:23
Yeah…
28:23
The tracks that they lived, the tracks that they wanted to…
28:28
Geoffrey Brooks: Well, there are places that had covenants, that
28:31
were actually deeded documents, that stated that you couldn’t
28:35
sell to anybody who was “colored.”
28:39
Or Japanese or Indian.
28:41
Japanese or Indian, although if you were Chinese, white
28:46
folks considered you passable.
28:49
And I’ll just use the general term “white privilege.” Some people got around
28:54
that by working directly with owner of the house and buying it on a contract.
29:02
In my mom and dad’s case, when we moved from Second and Moscow, which is over
29:07
right behind Holy Rosary Church, that house was actually owned by another
29:13
family of this church, Chick and Helen Robbins, Terry, who Joe and I grew up
29:21
with, that was their home, and we were renting and on that block were, or in
29:30
that neighborhood, First and Cherry, Second and Moscow, Gerry Caldwell and
29:39
his sister Alcena Boozer, who’s the past director of this church; also,
29:45
coincidentally his sister was my wife’s first counselor at Grant High School
29:52
and her first black history teacher.
29:54
Okay, so we’re talking about late ‘60s, early 70s.
29:59
Then she became director of the church.
30:00
She also was my boss at Jefferson High School for 13 years, well not completely
30:04
13 years, but a number of years.
30:08
One of the things that several people used to get around that was
30:12
there were some Caucasians here in town, they would buy the house…
30:17
Right
30:17
And then allow the family to move in.
30:19
And some of the black families had to move in
30:24
undercover of darkness, so then by sun, the next day
30:27
people realize it was too late.
30:30
But yeah, there were several people that would allow, that would use their
30:35
wherewithal, their knowledge, “You know, I can buy you that house; you
30:40
can pay me.” They would do it that way.
30:43
Several…Bill Hillard was a publisher of The Oregonian, editor of The
30:50
Oregonian – his family moved into a house under similar circumstances.
30:55
There were a lot of people of color who lived out in southeast Portland
30:59
that got their houses that very way.
31:03
Geoffrey
31:03
Well, my parents, there were already black folks living on 11th street, in
31:10
between Knott and [?] ; just recently sold my mom’s house last July, and
31:15
it’s actually mentioned in the book, “the home of James Brooks – James
31:20
and [?] Brooks.” But next door was one of my lifelong friends, Michael Jones,
31:26
across the street were the Poes and the Raffers which was a really famous
31:30
family so f you look in the PDF document,
31:35
the history of blacks in the city of Portland from 1805 to the present,
31:41
you’ll find that story about the Poes and the Raffers who lived across
31:44
the street, they had twelve kids.
31:46
You had the Bozers who lived across the street who had nine kids, okay, and then
31:52
you had the Barnetts who lived--- So there are already had black people living on
31:55
that block but next door to my mom’s house was a white man by the name of Mr. Peters
32:03
and the day that my parents moved into the house on 11th my dad was pulling a
32:11
’55 or ’54 Oldsmobile up the driveway with a trailer and the driveways in Irvington
32:18
had this steep, and he had his hand on the outside of the door and the breaks gave
32:23
way, the car came down, hit the telephone pole, it was on the parking strip,
32:27
and lopped off three of his fingers.
32:29
And of course, I was probably eight years old when we moved into this
32:32
house, and I see Mrs. Duke sitting behind me, maybe she remembers that too.
32:39
That may have been before she moved into her house in the corner.
32:43
But the point is that there are already black people living there,
32:46
but in the end, my dad actually bought that house from Henry Lee.
32:51
Henry Lee was a Chinese man who was the grandfather of the person who owned Huh
32:57
Far Low restaurant which is another way that people kind of out of red lining.
33:01
Now I’m not saying that my parent’s house was a red lining issue because there
33:05
were already black people living there.
33:07
But when Mr. Peters discovered that these black people were living in the
33:11
house, he would not speak to my father.
33:16
He would not because he didn’t like it, he was a World War II vet, a
33:19
World War I vet, you know, he was old school white guy, he would not.
33:24
But the day that my father lost his fingers, I think he felt badly.
33:28
And my dad came home, and now you can lose fingers or amputees, and people are
33:32
up inside of a day or two or a week; my father had to walk around with this cage
33:37
on his fingers for almost six months because the medical technology and
33:41
treatment was very different then, but in the process of that, one of the things my
33:48
father wanted to do was to start a rose garden on the side of his house because
33:52
on the side of his house was a strip and it was adjacent to Mr. Peter’s driveway.
33:58
And one day my father was having a lot of trouble and he tried to get on in the
34:02
yard and work and Mr. Peters came out and grabbed a shovel and still wouldn’t speak
34:08
to my father [laughter] but he turned over the dirt that allowed him to plant the
34:17
vegetables and the roses.
34:20
My point about this is what we understand about the human condition is that once
34:26
we begin to know each other, we can still harbor our personal point of view, but
34:32
human to human, sometimes that changes.
34:35
One of the things that I heard my father say, and it has to do with the Urban
34:39
League, and even the NAACP, because when I was in college, of course I got into
34:47
being a black nationalist and you know, all of that, my father and I used to
34:52
have knocked down dragged out arguments, even to the point where my dad and I
34:55
got into a fight in the front yard and Mr. Peters called the police [laughter]
35:00
. And the police showed up and when they showed up they said “That’s James
35:04
Brooks, director of the Urban League.
35:06
You don’t want to take these guys to court, we’ll end in the newspaper”
35:09
[laughter] . So they sat across the street and watch my dad and I argue.
35:15
But even though Portland was noted as one of the most racist
35:21
places west of the Mississippi…
35:23
That’s right
35:24
…there was still the motivation for people to move here, to
35:30
migrate here from Chicago, from the South, because the jobs were here.
35:37
And then once you got here it was the community and the Urban League
35:41
that ensured that your children were going to be safe and that you
35:46
were able to raise your children.
35:48
It’s still one of the best places in the United States to raise
35:51
children even though Portland is known as what’s still one of the
35:56
whitest cities in the United States.
35:58
And it is the Urban League and coincidently the NAACP that really
36:04
allowed black folks to move here and survive and then of course you have
36:10
the role of all of the black church but in this case were talking about St.
36:14
Philips church and again, I just want to repeat that we grew up, you know we had
36:24
Mr. Deiz, who is now 90 years old a member of the church who was a Tuskegee
36:30
airman; his wife who graduated from Lewis and Clark law school I want to say…
36:35
um-hmmm
36:36
Okay, became one of the first black judges, we had…
36:40
first black woman
36:42
first black women judge, correct, thank you.
36:45
You had Dr. Brown and Dr. Lewis, black dentists, Dr. Reynolds, who’s still alive.
36:54
Dr. Unthank who brought me into this world and brought many black folks.
36:58
I mean when I was born, my parents, I was born in Providence Hospital
37:03
but I couldn’t go in the front door.
37:04
My mom had to go through the loading dock.
37:08
you missed one
37:08
did I miss one?
37:11
Dr. Hamilton
37:11
Dr. Hamilton, thank you very much
37:12
who went to Stanford
37:14
He was the first black to graduate from Stanford law school
37:18
That’s right, who came back to Portland as a lawyer and worked
37:21
for the state government, right?
37:22
Right
37:23
he came back to practice law in Portland…
37:26
Uh-huh
37:27
And he moved up on Grant Avenue, no, up on Union Avenue with three white lawyers…
37:35
Uh-huh
37:36
And Oregon didn’t like that so they gave him a job with the Labor Division.
37:44
Now the reason I know that is because I was a member of the Labor Division.
37:52
Okay
37:53
And you know, I don’t want to take up too much time but I think it‘s also
37:56
important you have [?] Duke who’s sitting back here with her daughter who
38:01
lived down the street from my mom who ran a beauty salon on her own from…’53
38:14
to…years and years and years.
38:15
But her husband was a policeman during those years and his brother?
38:23
Your brother in law?
38:24
2
38:27
brothers, yeah, all three of them were on the force
38:28
All three of them were on the police force at a time when you know we were
38:33
having trouble with police, so here again, whether we’re talking about St. Philips
38:38
church or in the case of Mrs. Duke, these were the individuals that we grew
38:44
up watching; we considered that normal.
38:48
You know, I don’t think that Joe, I can speak for myself, I didn’t recognize how
38:53
significant that was in my development because I went to St. Philips church, had
38:59
a relationship with Father Stone; you said your daughter thought that he was God.
39:07
Yes
39:07
I don’t know Joe and I thought, if we thought he was God, but we
39:11
knew that he was way up there.
39:13
And when he trained us as acolytes there are so many stories that we could tell
39:17
you, some of which are laughable, some of which when we were growing up being 12
39:23
or 13 years old, you know, I mean when it came to sex or drinking or doing anything
39:30
wrong or Father Stone found out, you knew, you were always, you almost in more
39:34
trouble than if your patents found out.
39:37
I mean that’s how we revered him.
39:38
He taught us how to be young men and women, you know, and that, the
39:44
significance of this church in that regard it has come an imprint on us for all of
39:52
our lives and what’s funny, you’ve heard it earlier, when we come in the room or
39:58
we come to church you know they’ll say “Those are the kids” - hell, were; 65!
40:04
[laughter]
40:06
. So anyway, I just wanted to talk about that.
40:08
I think one thing that’s come out of this is that we, the people who
40:14
are younger than the elders, we were raised by people that taught us
40:23
how to live and not to really worry about what was going on around us.
40:28
Right
40:29
We did, we were taught to live for ourselves and that, you know, we
40:32
weren’t aware that we were being discriminated against all the time.
40:36
Sometimes it showed up, but normally it was happy go lucky.
40:41
I mean when I was a kid, outside play, had to go to the restroom,
40:48
I just ran in an open door.
40:48
I just ran to the house, left it clean [?] . People,
40:53
the whole neighborhood raised us.
40:56
And the whole neighborhood also disciplined us, that’s
41:00
another story for another time.
41:02
There’s a few things that you got, oh, Myrtle go ahead…
41:04
I’d just like to add, regarding the policemen, Charles,
41:09
George, and the other one.
41:12
When Carl Robson the renowned opera singer appeared here in
41:17
Portland, Charles Duke was on guard.
41:21
I remember that and so there have been several notables
41:26
here in the city of Portland.
41:27
I remember he was also on guard when Duke Ellington would show up in Portland too.
41:32
I want to say one thing about the police.
41:34
We did have several burglaries at our house and the police would come
41:40
and they would say “What did the person look like that robbed you?”
41:44
and of course we didn’t know but then they would put out pictures of young
41:49
children and all of them were black.
41:52
They just assumed because where we lived the people that would break into
41:57
our house were black and I said “Well, I don’t think - how do you know that
42:01
were black?” and we did have a lot of trouble with that because we did have a
42:06
number of burglaries and it appalled me.
42:09
Now we said nice things about the police but I would like to say in
42:13
this instance when they accused the children, black who robbed the
42:19
Belcher home, that made me very angry.
42:23
I’d like to go back to, the there’s some of the things that everybody has
42:26
talked about really are a deeper story.
42:29
I’m just going to real quickly go over a couple of these.
42:32
Mr. Ford was my grandfather and he was the first black teacher in
42:36
Portland but there is a plaque down at Portland public schools that
42:40
honors Mr. Ford and Mrs. Stone as the first black teachers in Portland.
42:45
I know I have a letter that is in the archives from Bill Berry that described
42:52
the whole scenario how Mrs. Stone couldn’t continue after being interviewed but when
42:58
Herb mentioned the issue of the music programs being cut in the schools that
43:02
were predominately black, I know that for many years I thought my grandfather
43:10
was just part of a public school program that was producing musical shows,
43:15
talent shows, that were right across the street from us here, then Knott Street
43:19
Community Center, and it wasn’t until many, many years later that I found
43:23
out that all of that was volunteer.
43:26
That he spent his own money, he produced these programs for many of these
43:30
young people that went on to become professional people but in all of them
43:35
he taught them a certain amount of respect for themselves and to stand
43:39
for themselves and to stand tall.
43:42
Somebody else mentioned, oh Geoffrey mentioned the connection to the Hug Far
43:46
Low restaurant with Mr. Lee and when we were kids and Gerry was saying, we didn’t
43:52
always realize we were being discriminated against but as a child one of the first
43:57
things I ever read to my father was a sign that said, I said, “Dad, what does
44:01
“white trade only” mean?” And so at six years old he had described to me and
44:07
explained to me that I was different.
44:11
And that not only was I different and couldn’t be served in certain
44:14
places but so was my little Japanese friend and my little friend who
44:19
was Indian who went to my school.
44:22
And that kind of was why we ended up wondering why when we went downtown we
44:27
would usually eat at Hug Far Low or The Republic because those were the places
44:32
that accepted us and we just thought out parents just loved Chinese food and that’s
44:36
why they always went there every time.
44:39
Also, and though it’s not this unique to this church but I know, I know
44:43
Geoffrey would say the same thing, every black man we knew in this church had
44:48
at least two jobs and some had three.
44:52
And many of the men who built this church that worked on the railroad and
44:56
I know Geoffrey’s father worked on the railroad at one point, many of these
44:59
men that worked on the railroad were out of town for four days a week, the other
45:04
three days a week when they’d come back to Portland they worked another job.
45:08
And they were people that they may not have been professionals but the way they
45:13
handled themselves, we treated them like they were professional men because they
45:18
deserved respect for how hard they worked.
45:20
And Knott Street Center is now known as Matt Dishman Center and when the Duke
45:25
brothers were policemen in Portland, Matt Dishman was the first black
45:31
man, for many years the only, that was a sheriff in Multnomah County.
45:38
I used to think it was funny to me that Mr. Dishman, during times
45:43
when he was still off duty that and my neighborhood when I visited my
45:47
grandfather Mr. Ford, that we would see Mr. Dishman in his uniform.
45:53
And so when I would go to the local grocery store, Johnny and Lenny’s,
46:00
I would hear people walk by Mr. Dishman and say “Mr. Dishman, how
46:03
did you do that?” because black men were not even allowed to apply to
46:07
become a law enforcement officer.
46:10
And then we go around the corner and I was holding my grandfather’s
46:13
hand and they would say, “Mr.
46:15
Ford, how did you do that” because the black man wasn’t
46:18
supposed to become a teacher.
46:20
And the on by way he did become the first was because he purposely forgot
46:24
to send his picture with his resume and he had two college degrees and
46:29
he thought they would assume that Morgan States was not a black college.
46:33
So the things that these people did to survive and show us a certain amount
46:38
of respect without feeling anger and resent was I think was such a marvelous
46:44
job to raise us as the next generation.
46:46
Geoffrey.
46:46
Man, there are just so many stories.
46:50
I don’t think that when I went to high school that I ever thought that I
46:54
was anything other than middle class.
46:57
But Joe’s right.
46:59
My dad came from Wilbaforce University, had a degree in biology, couldn’t
47:03
get a job because he was colored.
47:06
I never, that never came across to me.
47:09
Okay, he worked two jobs; he worked a red cap at the station, he worked
47:16
in the post office as a janitor.
47:18
You know, Gerry and Mr. Amerson might say other jobs that my dad did.
47:23
I never knew that…
47:24
Sears and Roble
47:25
Sears and Roble, he worked at Monkey Wards, that’s what you
47:28
used to call Montgomery Wards.
47:30
Most all of these men who either were professional or laborers or
47:37
workers had this dignity about them in terms of raising their family
47:42
that their children never really knew what they had to put up with.
47:48
And until one day when I was in college at Oregon State University,
47:56
and you know I came home, I was chairman of the Black Student Union,
48:00
and I came home and my dad and I were having some kind of an argument…
48:08
Again
48:08
[laugher]
48:08
Again, she knows because she was dad’s executive assistant or secretary.
48:15
And sometimes I would go up to the Urban League offices and you know people would
48:18
look around and say, “Man, is he going to get into with James?” you know, and
48:23
one day my dad and I were having this argument in a tiny room and I just stopped
48:28
and took a deep breath and I looked, I get really emotional about this, I
48:32
looked at my dad and I said, “So when the hell is discrimination going to end?
48:37
When is this going to end?” And that’s the first time, it’s probably
48:42
one of the two times that I’d ever see my father cry in front of me.
48:45
He actually turned his back on me and he took a long, deep breath and
48:49
he said, “Son, I don’t know, but you got to keep living your life
48:54
the way that we’ve instructed you.
48:56
Even though you and I at this point disagree, you know, you have a life,
49:02
I’ve given you the foundation, you just need to keep going.” And at that point
49:07
I think I had the kind of respect for my father that I never had before as a man
49:13
because now I was an emerging young man.
49:17
I took that lesson back to Oregon State University – because I came
49:20
to Oregon State University after the Dee Andros incident everybody left.
49:26
I was in the military and I came back and Oregon State, they told me, they said,
49:30
“Well, you got to live in the dorm.” I told the people in the finance aid office,
49:34
“You know what, if I live I the dorm, I’m going to kill some of ya’ll white folk.
49:39
Because I’ve seen some stuff that ya’ll ain’t seen.
49:41
That ain’t happening.” My dad’s fraternity brother, here’s another
49:45
name, Lonnie B. Harris, okay, he and my dad were fraternity brothers.
49:52
I think my dad and Lonnie conspired to get me to go to Oregon State because
49:57
my dad didn’t think that I was ever going to go back to college, you know.
50:01
And thanks to those two, I graduated from Oregon State and then became a teacher.
50:05
But again, the point is that we grew up in a time where I don’t think that we really
50:12
understood what our parents went through.
50:15
We never really knew.
50:16
We thought we were “middle class.” I never had any experience with
50:23
discrimination until after I grew up, and you know, went away to the military.
50:29
I mean the buddies that I had in the South when I was in the army, they used to say,
50:35
“Well man, you can’t talk to these white people like that.” I said, “Why not?
50:38
I grew up with white people and they ain’t nothing but just white folk.” And
50:41
they used to say, “Oh man, don’t say that man, you going to get us in trouble.”
50:44
We actually got kicked out of a pool hall because I had that conversation
50:47
in public in a black pool hall and the owner of the pool hall, this was in
50:55
Richmond, Virginia, which is, because I was stationed in Fort Lee.
50:58
Even the black folks down there, they had all these military guys
51:01
who came from the North and we had a very different perspective about race
51:06
because we grew up with white people.
51:08
So we were never afraid; so when we went to the South, it was like oh man,
51:13
these guys are, they’re crazy, they’re trouble makers, they’re rebel rousers.
51:18
It’s because we grew up with white people.
51:19
Lastly, Joe and I and Mike Rice and a bunch of us, now can look back in
51:26
our 60s and say, “You know that was an advantage, because we weren’t afraid of
51:30
white people.” I mean I did some stuff in Georgia that you would think you
51:35
know during ’68, ’69, ’70, you know, some stuff that probably would have got
51:41
anybody black person or negro or colored person 10 years earlier than that probably
51:45
would have gotten them killed, hung, or in jail or whatever. But you know, we
51:50
came from a different perspective. It’s because we were born and raised here.
51:54
That’s right.
51:54
So let’s take a quick break and there’s one last question I want everybody to
51:59
talk about, and that’s I want you to think of an issue, we’ve talked about
52:04
red lining, we’ve talked about the “white trade only” signs, we’ve talked
52:08
about job discrimination, and Herb and Myrtle especially since you and
52:13
Geoffrey with your father and Allison being on the Board, I’d just like you
52:18
to describe one issue that you remember dealing with with the Urban League
52:23
and how they dealt with the problem and if there’s any part you know that
52:27
Father Stone played in that. Okay? So just think about that for a second
52:33
[pause] . We’re going to describe issues that we know that the Urban
52:38
League either helped us personally or helped the larger community deal with
52:43
issues of discrimination in Portland.
52:46
And I’m going to just start off down the row here and so Gerry you
52:51
were telling me about an issue with your first car you ever bought.
52:54
Yeah, when I was a young banker I went to buy a new car and I went to the
52:59
bank for a loan and they were hemming and hawing and looking all seriously.
53:05
And James Lee who I don’t know he was the director or the treasurer of the Urban
53:10
League, they had a little credit union and he said, “Well, Gerry we know who you are,
53:17
you bring your papers over to me.” So I said, “Okay” – I took the papers over to
53:23
him and I walked out there with a check.
53:28
It wasn’t a matter of you know you got to go through all the credit reports.
53:31
The point was we know you, we know your family, you know, so
53:36
you can get this car, you can get
53:40
it and it was a brand new mustang.
53:43
Oh boy!
53:44
Yeah.
53:44
I’m just going to quickly break in there because Gerry’s family
53:48
I known my whole my life.
53:50
My mom and dad used to tell stories that when black people were not allowed
53:54
into any restaurants or clubs in Portland that Mr. Caldwell, who was
53:59
one of the railroad’s top chefs, and he was a master chef, that he would
54:05
open up his home to people to come by on Saturdays and sometimes Friday
54:11
nights and just come by and have a drink, eat food, bring your own bottle
54:16
if you like and that became the place where a lot of people met in Portland.
54:22
But his dad was well known in the Union Pacific as a master chef and when my
54:26
father, after working two jobs, saved up enough money for us to finally go
54:31
visit family in the South, or course we traveled by the train, and Mr.
54:36
Caldwell had already told the people that worked on the train, “You take
54:40
care of the Nunn family because they’re going all the way back to Arkansas.”
54:43
It was a, railroading was a big family and my dad was a chef and for those
54:50
days made pretty good money, but he’d come in off the railroad in the evening
54:56
and in the morning one of us kids got up and drove him to the Congress Hotel
55:02
and they get through the Congress Hotel during the day where he cooked and
55:05
then that night we’d take him out to one of the country clubs to cook more.
55:10
He more worked more than - and we thought he was doing it because he liked it.
55:15
So that shows you how hidden and dark we were.
55:19
It also shows you the attitude that they had about work.
55:22
Yeah
55:24
Allison
55:25
Well…
55:26
they had to support the family
55:27
That’s right / Yes
55:32
I would just like to mention that not being black but having my parents who
55:39
lived with me down in Florida and Oklahoma when my father was stationed there
55:44
during the second World War, my parents would not let me go to school in Florida
55:50
because the schools were segregated.
55:53
And my parents, although they had never been around black people, thought this
55:57
was wrong so they kept me at home and my mother did the teaching and I’m not sure
56:03
that I really did very well in mathematics later, but I learned the Bible, Aesop’s
56:09
Fables, and a number of other things my mother thought were very important.
56:14
But the message they taught me back there, and this was in 1944, that black people
56:22
are – white people and Chinese, Japanese, or whatever nationality - are all created
56:29
by God and that we are all equal and it was amazing because it wasn’t what white
56:36
people did in that time but my parents who were, my mother was not educated, she only
56:44
went through high school, my father was a Ph.D in Chemistry, but they realized the
56:50
most important thing was that all people should have opportunities and they felt
56:56
very bad that what was happening, but we couldn’t move because Daddy was stationed
57:01
with the Navy, but that’s where I learned and I learned it in the 7th and 8th grade.
57:06
I wasn’t in school but then I learned it from my parents which I
57:10
am forever grateful to my parents.
57:13
And Allison, when you were on the Board of the Urban League, do you
57:15
remember any particular issues that the Urban League dealt with that you…
57:19
Yes, and it was something that I didn’t agree with particularly; it was somebody
57:24
coming from South Africa to address a group in Portland and this person
57:31
was for apartheid, and although I was opposed to apartheid, I also believed
57:37
that people should have the opportunity to speak whether you agree with them
57:40
or not and I certainly didn’t support apartheid but I felt that he shouldn’t
57:47
be, and I think that it was male - I can’t remember the name now, that he
57:50
should not be kept from speaking because he didn’t agree with what I agreed with
57:57
or what the Urban League agreed with.
57:59
So that was one thing I remember particularly.
58:02
Also much discussion about education in the schools.
58:07
Okay, Geoffrey.
58:08
Well, when my dad was director of the Urban League, I think before he was
58:15
director, and this is where I will differ to Mr. Amerson and Ms. Carr,
58:23
he was in charge of the name of the program to break down the building trades
58:32
Education Advancement Program
58:33
Right, well, and I remember he was trying to break that down and I remember over
58:38
on, off of Belmont, across the street from the Multnomah County building,
58:42
and I’m not exactly sure on like 29th or 28th, was either the carpenters
58:47
or the electricians union office, and I remember my dad was over there,
58:54
they were negotiating with them, they were trying to break it down so that
58:58
young folks could get into the trades.
59:01
To this day there are a number of people who are my age who say to me, “I wouldn’t
59:06
have made it if it wasn’t for your dad.” Okay, and I, and they said that from
59:13
that program to break down the trades but also, he was also one of the other jobs
59:18
was he was a counselor at night at JDH.
59:22
You know, so he saved a lot of juvenile delinquents, including his son who got
59:26
close to being in there a couple times.
59:28
But I just remember coming home from Oregon State, unexpectedly in the middle
59:33
of the week, and I came home and my mom who was one of the first black women to
59:38
be a manager at Techtronic’s said, “Your dad’s over on Belmont, I think they’re
59:45
gonna, I don’t know whether they’re gonna lynch him or not.” And I said, “What?!”so
59:48
I drove my little ’67 Volkswagen over there and I remember coming around the
59:52
corner and I remember I seen all these white dudes in the middle of the street
59:57
and they’re all yelling and screaming and here was my dad who is a man of physical
1:00:02
stature, wasn’t even bigger than me.
1:00:05
He’s five foot six, five foot seven, you know, light skin, but he had the
1:00:09
same voice that I had, and he, you could picture this image: all these
1:00:14
white boys standing out there, they’re all yelling a screaming and all looking
1:00:17
mean, you know, if they could have had guns, they probably would have had guns.
1:00:21
And here’s my dad standing on the sidewalk facing this building with all
1:00:26
these guys; the police are across the street just watching; and here’s my dad,
1:00:32
and all these guys are yelling and my dad, calmly with his deep voice having a
1:00:36
logical conversation with these guys as to why they should break this down and
1:00:41
let these young people become apprentices.
1:00:46
And it was at that point I realized, “Oh, this is what Daddy does.
1:00:51
Damn, that’s pretty heavy.” So it’s another one of those elevating moments for
1:00:57
me in watching my father do what he did.
1:01:02
And I finally realized, “Oh, he just doesn’t sit in the office at
1:01:07
the Urban League, he’s not just a desk jockey, if you will, this is
1:01:11
really what’s going on.” That had a tremendous impact on this city
1:01:15
because there are black electricians, black plumbers, etc, now, who came up
1:01:21
during that time, okay, who now have a trade and can make a livelihood.
1:01:26
That was one of the tenants of my actual teaching social studies
1:01:31
with kids, even though it wasn’t part of the scope and sequence or
1:01:34
it wasn’t past of the curriculum.
1:01:36
I used to tell young people, “You know what, you need to stop acting
1:01:39
crazy because you have to grow up and provide yourself a livelihood.
1:01:44
Do you know what that means?” So you’d just see these young kids, “Livelihood,
1:01:47
what the hell is that?” And then when you explain it’s a matter of making a living
1:01:52
and supporting yourself and your family, but I got that from watching my father.
1:01:57
Yes, and I must say that I know that we all had conversations in the ‘60s
1:02:04
at our high school classmates that just thought it was awful to see the police
1:02:09
dogs jumping on people during the Martin Luther King demonstrations in the South
1:02:13
and the bombing of the Alabama church.
1:02:16
But yet when we would talk to them about discrimination within our
1:02:19
own city, they didn’t believe it, they didn’t think it happened.
1:02:23
So that silent discrimination we had because by 1959 or so most of the
1:02:28
white trades set “white trade only” signs were gone, but we still had that
1:02:33
silent discrimination of red lining, of people ignoring you in restaurants
1:02:39
and other places, and that silent discrimination is what made some of
1:02:45
our colleagues of other races not realize what the discrimination was.
1:02:50
And it made some people of other ethnicities like Asian people realize
1:02:55
that, well maybe we should just be quiet and just try to blend in and things
1:03:00
will get better, but if it wasn’t for those people that actually spoke up
1:03:05
and stood up and confronted the racism head on like you father did, things
1:03:11
would not have changed nearly as much.
1:03:14
So with that, Herb, you being the director of the Urban League, I know you dealt
1:03:17
with some of these right, just head on.
1:03:19
The director of the Board.
1:03:21
Yeah, director of the Board, right.
1:03:25
I didn’t know if you are aware that the national Urban League has a chairman of
1:03:34
the board also, and years ago they used to have contact with Washington and they
1:03:42
would get a social program, they’d get money, and with that money they would
1:03:48
distribute it to the branch offices.
1:03:54
We had one of the, in Portland, was a, I don’t remember exactly now but we
1:04:03
could go in, get the boss to hire him, and pay them so much money and they
1:04:11
would put them, these kids to work.
1:04:14
Many kids come in and say, would come in, and you would offer them a
1:04:18
job, and they’d say I want your job.
1:04:21
They weren’t going to school, they, and so we really saved these kids.
1:04:26
And I can recall that there’s furniture place in northeast Portland,
1:04:33
I can’t remember where it was, but
1:04:36
Next to the now freeway?
1:04:37
Yeah, well
1:04:40
I remember going to that place, and I put five guys to work out there one day
1:04:45
but I had to pay this guys a hundred and some dollars to put these kids to work.
1:04:51
And you had to get the kids to promise you that they were going
1:04:56
to work at least four weeks.
1:04:59
You got to work four weeks, but I see kids today in some of the jobs that we
1:05:06
handled like the apprentice program and other monies that used to come in from
1:05:11
various places but a young man that was going to school I think was studying
1:05:18
accounting and I got him a job; and he is almost your age now and I see
1:05:27
him occasionally and he says, “Oh, Mr. Amerson, I’m getting retire soon” - still
1:05:32
speaks to me every time I see him.
1:05:35
So I did so some good for the community as a whole and those
1:05:41
kids that were not going to school.
1:05:43
It’s kind of lie the old saying “Every kid isn’t cut out for
1:05:48
college” and that’s what happened.
1:05:51
So Herb you remind me of the saying that I’ve heard before “The best way
1:05:55
to stop a bullet is to have a job”
1:06:02
That’s right.
1:06:02
Yes, Myrtle.
1:06:02
I’d like to go back just a little bit when you mention that
1:06:05
discrimination, about the existence of the Ku Klux Klan in this area.
1:06:13
It was so vivid and so alive here, even more so than some of the southern states
1:06:20
Yes / Terrible
1:06:21
And I remember, we think that no, it wasn’t here, but it was
1:06:24
here and moving, I mean strong.
1:06:30
I’d like to stay regarding the Urban League Public Accommodations Law.
1:06:36
When Bellefonte, another noted
1:06:42
singer, when he stayed at the Benson; he couldn’t come in the front door, he had
1:06:46
to come in on the elevator, I mean the back door, and take the back elevator.
1:06:53
Fair Employment Practices Law - Because of Bill Berry working with
1:06:57
the legislature, and working with people in the legislature, we were
1:07:02
able to have these laws passed.
1:07:04
I remember even if you were at the Urban League, it could be at 2 o’clock in the
1:07:09
morning and the telephone would ring, now I don’t know who was calling, but actually
1:07:15
he, like I said he was one of the greatest men that I ever met, and he worked
1:07:20
tirelessly to get things going, and I think that it was great that he was chosen
1:07:28
to take the Urban League of the time,
1:07:33
bringing it here to Portland.
1:07:36
Yes, Oregon had this the largest Klan population west of the Mississippi
1:07:41
and I believe that in the early
1:07:44
1900s and thanks to some white historians that have tracked all of
1:07:47
this, they had a convention in Astoria that drew something like 10,000
1:07:52
people who were all Klan members.
1:07:54
And the Rose Festival used to have a parade two weeks before the Rose
1:08:02
Festival where the Klan walked done Broadway with the police chief and the
1:08:07
mayor and that was not stopped until it seemed like it was disrespectful to
1:08:14
the Jewish population; so that was not stopped until Hitler invaded Poland and
1:08:19
it was partly stopped because German people of German ancestry in places
1:08:24
like New York still walked around with German uniforms on, from the armed
1:08:30
forces, and yet here we were in the west where the Klan was operating out
1:08:36
in the open with the government and the U.S. government realized we’ve gotta
1:08:41
clamp down on that and change that.
1:08:43
And at the same time we had people like Mr. Deiz who was being trained with
1:08:48
Tuskegee airman as black people were trying to do their part in the war.
1:08:54
And I know in your dad’s time in World War I, don’t forget that black men actually
1:09:00
took their savings, went overseas to France, joined the French Foreign Legion
1:09:06
under the American flag, and then died in our names to give the respect that
1:09:13
men should be able to fight in those wars as black men fought in every war
1:09:17
from the beginning of the Revolution.
1:09:19
All the way back to Crispus Attacks who was the first black man to
1:09:21
die in the Revolutionary War.
1:09:23
So, we’ve always been patriotic, always.
1:09:25
That’s right.
1:09:27
So any other issues we want to talk about in connection with the Urban League?
1:09:31
Not one, but I’d like to digress just a little bit and tell Geoffrey
1:09:35
how his father’s parents were real people with foresight because they
1:09:43
named his dad “James O’Neal Brooks” I figured out that means “Job”
1:09:51
[Laughter]
1:09:51
And James Brooks would get people the jobs.
1:09:55
Well, and I think just another side note, James’s
1:10:02
second great-grandson was born April 4th – he’s only a month old; his
1:10:07
name is DeShawn James O’Neal Bunch.
1:10:12
And I, and so, obviously I’m proud of that but in the conversation that I had
1:10:18
with Chelsea she said that she vividly remembers when my dad died and his
1:10:24
funeral was right in this church and she was sitting in the front row, she was
1:10:28
probably eight or nine years old, and she remembers her cousin, but we called
1:10:35
him Uncle Lemay, who gave the eulogy, and he talked about j-o-b as “Job” or
1:10:43
“Job” – and she said, “I wanted to honor my papa.” And so, you know, he nickname
1:10:52
is now D.J. but it’s James O’Neal Bunch.
1:10:55
So I just think that’s really cool.
1:10:57
It’s just really cool.
1:10:58
You know, just one last thing I want to describe: when Myrtle was talking
1:11:02
about the Public Accommodations Law as I recall I know Mr. Rutherford and Mrs.
1:11:10
Rutherford led a lot of this but didn’t, weren’t there groups that people that
1:11:15
came to St. Philips and then drove down to Salem to stand up for the bill and
1:11:24
lobby the legislature.
1:11:26
I know St. Philips was on the churches that I remember they met at.
1:11:29
That was one of the things that my father talked about, about Neil Goldschmidt
1:11:34
because he was the governor then and that’s when the Public, one of the Public
1:11:38
Accommodations Laws was actually signed.
1:11:41
Am I right about that?
1:11:42
Yeah.
1:11:43
And if you look at the PDF file on the CD “The history of black folks 1805 to
1:11:49
the present” you’d find a picture of that; you’ll also find a picture of one
1:11:54
of the first black owned corporations called the Albina Corporation.
1:11:57
What
1:12:00
was the name?
1:12:00
Albina Corporation.
1:12:01
Who was that?
1:12:04
Palmer?
1:12:05
No.
1:12:06
um…Nero,
1:12:10
David Nero
1:12:12
Nero
1:12:12
And my dad was on the board of directors, okay, so there’s a lot
1:12:16
of stuff that our parents or people, so you really gotta look at that.
1:12:21
And if you want more documentation like we talked about, about what black people
1:12:26
had to go through in the 1800s, which really sets the foundationally, legally,
1:12:32
what the constitutional laws were.
1:12:34
This conversation is enhanced by looking and at historical
1:12:40
background to some of that.
1:12:42
So if you want some of that, I’ll send it you.
1:12:45
Thank you, Myrtle
1:12:46
This is a little aside from
1:12:50
when Nelson Rockefeller was president of the National Urban League and
1:12:56
Whitney Young was the president of the Urban League, he received a
1:13:02
Christmas card from him, he didn’t realize; he just threw the card aside.
1:13:10
Later he opened the card at it was $10,000.
1:13:14
Oh my goodness!
1:13:15
And also at the National Urban League conference back New York,
1:13:22
Nelson Rockefeller flew his band in.
1:13:26
Wow
1:13:27
Flew his band in and had a suite and it was one of the most
1:13:33
lavish affairs I ever attended.
1:13:37
Wow
1:13:37
So he had people like that on the Board who had money and
1:13:41
were also giving their talent.
1:13:45
We’ve always been successful that way.
1:13:47
Wow, that’s fantastic.
1:13:48
Well, I want to thank you.
1:13:51
Gerry…
1:13:51
Just a few more on how great Father Stone was: back in the days when my folks
1:14:02
would have parties every now and then and they would sometimes furnish the liquor
1:14:07
refreshments for the parties but they would always invite Father Stone, and
1:14:14
Father Stone would sit at the bar, at the end of the bar, and you were surprised
1:14:21
at how the liquor consumption was not done so much because Father Stone was
1:14:26
sitting there watching those people.
1:14:29
That’s just the kind of man he was.
1:14:34
[laughter]
1:14:34
I want to thank…yes, Herb
1:14:34
I want to say one more thing about Father Stone.
1:14:36
Okay.
1:14:38
My son went to OES, Oregon Episcopal Schools; well he was the first
1:14:46
black kid to go to the school.
1:14:57
When Father Stone came to the house and said, “Here’s what I want you to
1:15:02
do” – they sent us five sheets of paper for Greg to fill out, that he had to have
1:15:11
all these tests, and they wanted to make sure that he wouldn’t grab a white girl
1:15:21
you know, running the room with her or something. But anyway, no other kids had
1:15:27
to fill out these forms, but Greg had to fill out a stack of forms like that and go
1:15:33
to a doctor and to a psychiatrist before they would let him in the school and then
1:15:40
Father Stone said, and at that time it was Bishop Dagwell, I don’t know exactly.
1:15:46
Un-hmm
1:15:47
Bishop Dagwell called Father Stone and told Father Stone, send Amerson
1:15:53
out and so that’s how he got in.
1:15:56
Wow.
1:15:57
Wow.
1:15:58
That’s a great story Herb, I didn’t; know that.
1:16:00
I want to thank you all very much.
1:16:02
I know some of you were worried about where your memories were going to be but I
1:16:05
don’t think we had any problem with that.
1:16:07
And I just want to thank you for sharing your history and your lives
1:16:11
with us because this is going to live on forever and there’s going to
1:16:14
be a new generation that’s going to learn from what you told us today.
1:16:20
Thank you
1:16:23
so much.
1:16:23
Thank you.
1:16:23
Natalia Fernández: And today’s date is May 8, 2013.
1:16:27
We are in Portland, Oregon, at St. Philip the Deacon.
