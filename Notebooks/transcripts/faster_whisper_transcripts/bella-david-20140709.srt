00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay Dr. Bell, if you would please introduce yourself to your name and today's date in our location.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Um, David Bell, and today is July 9th.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
July 9th.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, July 9th, 2014, and we're located at my place on the Portable and Cabin.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Terrific.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What's the start of the beginning?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You were born in Grinch, Connecticut.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Grinch, Connecticut.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Grinch, Connecticut in 1938.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And were you raised there?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was raised there pretty much, you know, for my whole life until I went to college.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can you tell us about sort of your experience of Grinch growing up?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, Grinch is an interesting place.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a powerful place.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A lot of millionaires, we weren't one of them.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My dad was principal at high school.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And I went to the same high school.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I think I really learned about leadership.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He was very good.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He said, if you spend more than 50% of your time in your office, you're not doing your job.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So as a student, he knew what was going on.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was amazed.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
None of the students ever gave me any hassle.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They said he was tough, but he's fair.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And he learned all sorts of things.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And he did this by getting down to the trenches.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I mean, he'd go down the border of the room and just talk with the maintenance people.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He'd talk with the people serving up floating in cafeteria.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And he wouldn't ask him for anything.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They would just tell him because they were part of the team.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I learned that kind of leadership from him.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Unfortunately, we don't see that kind very often.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What were your parents' backgrounds?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
My dad was a physicist, went to Yale.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And he became high school principal and physical physics teacher.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And my mother was a pianist.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The concert pianist she died when I was four.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I can still remember sitting under the piano while she practiced.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And we did quite a bit of camping.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My dad ran a summer camps for churches, Lutheran Church.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I learned a lot about nature then.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And the respect of nature from these big camps.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And they had a lot of these.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And their idea for helping kids was to get them into nature.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And that's what they did.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I had that background.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And my beginning of environmental concerns came out of the church background in these summer camps.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did you have any siblings?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I had three sisters and older sisters and two younger sisters.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How was the household managed after your mother passed?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, my father remarried several times.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And he...

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I just treated him as a normal household.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He was a very good mentor.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And he had male friends who ran these summer camps.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I had an anologa who was...

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She was quite a doer.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I never thought that women couldn't do anything men could do because my anologa, obviously, could.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So it just, you know, just never occurred to me.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And so, you know, that was the household.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We lived sort of in the country, not quite like this.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But spent a lot of time outdoors.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That was good.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What were your interests as a boy besides being outdoors, I suppose?

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Outdoors, building tree huts.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I guess that was it.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I wasn't into... I played sports, but not, you know, not really that much.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So just hanging around outdoors and doing stuff, I guess.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did you enjoy school?

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was not particularly in high school a great student.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like most kids at age, I enjoyed seeing my friends and seeing my friends.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's what I did.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What were your first inclinations towards science or engineering?

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, I don't know.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think I was always... I want to do something.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so I don't think I really...

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I mean, I was pretty good at science.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was interesting.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And engineering seemed more like you were going to do something.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I just sort of... it wasn't any big decision.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I did decide to go to the Virginia Military Institute,

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which anybody knows is a pretty tough place to go, particularly that first year you're rat.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, take me through the process of making that decision. Why VMI?

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, VMI, like I say, it's tough.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I looked around a lot. You know, when you're growing up,

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
kids, boys, at least.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's the matter? Can't you take it?

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They play sort of those games.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You think, well, when I get older, I don't have to play those games.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As I get older though, I saw a lot of men were playing those games.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Same thing. I mean, I see it all the time at Oregon State University.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
People getting co-opted and afraid to speak up.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I said, I'm just going to go there.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then, you know, it's tough.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And if anybody says, what's the matter? Can't you take it?

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll just laugh out of mine. You go through the rat line. It's pretty tough.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I think that was the way I thought of it.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And it generally worked that way.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was tough.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You just saw it as a challenge that you wanted to take on.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a challenge, that's right.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I saw it as a challenge to take on.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I wasn't planning career military.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I wasn't looking for a disciplined life.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It was a challenge.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I think VMI nurtured that.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You always had a maverick spirit, very rigid, tough discipline,

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but there was always a tension there, a creative tension.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And so I thought of the word challenge as a positive word.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And something's challenging.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
My eyes light up. Oh, okay.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What are we going to do about it?

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And it was a good education. Class sizes were about 2022.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I had some pretty remarkable people there.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Jonathan Daniels was a martyr in the Civil Rights Movement.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He was a seminary student when he left the M.I.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He became an episcopal priest and he got killed there.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That really jolted the South, unfortunately.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know, Jonathan had to give his life for it.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But he was quite a person.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He was a valedictorian of our class.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, what was the environment like at BMI, especially that first year?

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, that first year you were a rat.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That first year and you're on the go all the time.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's physically and mentally demanding, psychologically demanding.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But all your classmates are in the same boat.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So it's not like they're picking on you.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, you're all in it together.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And there are times of manuals and say,

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
well, they can't kill me.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And this isn't going to last forever.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Somehow that would get you through.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I thought of that years later in terms of racial prejudice

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
because people can't say that.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They couldn't say that.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And when I went back to one of my reunions,

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
one of the most impressive things that happened to me,

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
there was an older guy there that was a maintenance person.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And he was black.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And I told him what year I was there.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I think he says, oh, that's when he began.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And he comes in.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He gives me this big hug and we're celebrating together.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it felt really good.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It really did.

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And they've integrated down there because it was not integrated when I went there.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And they've done a really good job.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And there's men and women down there now.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And so not integrated as in it was whites only,

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
or there were white classes and white classes.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was almost all white.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think it probably was all white.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And just in a South that, you know,

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
people just didn't even think of it.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And Jonathan did.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He gave his life for it.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, when they decided, when they, at VMI,

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
they figured, man, this is a serious problem.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They really set out to correct it.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And they really did.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And we've had some remarkable graduates, white and black and the patient.

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So it was, it was really, you know,

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I would say turning point in my life,

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I mean, to see that change is wonderful.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What else was expected of students there besides the coursework?

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, you had physically demanding.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And of course, you're first year, you're harassed.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I mean, you're in the rat line, you're a rat.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And you're on the go all the time.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And so it's hard to describe.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean, the Marines respected it.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I've had several Marines say, yeah, it's tough.

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And for a Marine, that's probably about the best compliment you can get.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And it's mutual.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So a lot of physical training and military drilling, guys, didn't work?

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, there's not a particularly a lot of drilling.

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You had to raise that you did and you marched and you wore uniforms.

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But the academics were very good.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And classes were small.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And they were, you know, they were academically very good.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it's just tough schedule.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And physically demanding.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean, if you've got a chance to take a nap,

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you'd lay down for 15 minutes and go to sleep and wake up and start all over again.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But during the day, you didn't even have your beds down.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I mean, you rolled up the mattresses.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They were up against, you know, rolled up and they called it a hay rack.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That was leaned against the wall.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It was pretty rigid.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But, you know, he's had sort of a maverick spirit to it.

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
One night we tried it.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We put the evening gun.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
90 millimeter howitzer in the PX.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know, snuck out there.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, there'd be things you'd sort of do that way.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And things, things would happen.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So it was, you learn some things like pulling rink.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's really bad.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, if somebody does something, yeah, you got ranking.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Of course, a dean or president has to do things.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They have responsibility.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We all know that.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But if they do something, and it's only because I got the rink.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's pulling rink.

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And that's not looked on pretty well.

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
In fact, they'd have a parade.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And in the parade, there'd be a flanking movement.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The troops are companies.

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There'd be tons of going on the line.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And the officer was a kid at officer,

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but being in the front with a saber marching in the front.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And there would be tack officers grading the lines.

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, if he had pulled rink, those lines would just go like this.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then he'd get chewed out.

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So they, you know, if you pulled rink, we'd throw lines.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So I mean, it was, it was just pulling rink was not considered

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
a particularly good thing.

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I see more of it going on at Oregon State University.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And people sort of accepting it.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's the part that drives me nuts.

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, someone says something.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Does something that doesn't make sense.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
People like and courteous, but tell them.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A lot of times they, you know, they may get upset,

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but they really, the best ones know they need to hear that.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But I've seen just too many people with this blank face.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Just don't say anything.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't do it.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How your academic life sort of evolved while you're at DMI?

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, I actually got better grades in college than I did in high school.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I ended up with a civil engineering degree.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I don't know whether I had any career,

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
or aspirations of that.

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It was like you're entering a big open space,

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you know, you're entering the future.

237
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So I didn't have an agenda, what I wanted to do,

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
what I wanted to be.

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I wanted to do something, do something interesting.

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I was more scout, I sort of explore.

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I think at VMI they encouraged that.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You would ask questions in class.

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I thought it was a good education that way.

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I know we're bad teachers, yeah, but you always are.

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But you learn from them too.

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, you took that education and your first job was with the Division of Indian Health.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, US Public Health Service.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Indian Health and I went to New Mexico and loved it.

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And it was a sanitary engineer, they called them.

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And we put in water and sewer systems in Indian pueblos.

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And I bring in translators.

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And then I got transferred to state of Washington.

253
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And it was kind of funny, because they said, well, there's a project that has a little bit of a problem.

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Any time a government agency says we have a little bit of a problem,

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that means it's a disaster.

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So when I got up there, the project engineer wasn't even there.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And it turns out that some woman had punched them out.

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
After listening to the stories, I began to understand why.

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But, you know, we got the project lined up.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But even there, there were some things, you know, you had to do.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Like, they didn't have enough parts to keep the crews busy.

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, if you look at the government procedures, it takes months to get the parts.

263
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Your budget's going to be gone.

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Or you do that, or you have to lay off the crew.

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And so I just went out and told them, wrote a memo and said,

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm going to go and buy some parts wholesale.

267
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And if this is a problem, please call me.

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And then I stayed away from the phone.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I got the parts, you know, and they were upset because they probably could have saved $30

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
by going through the GAO or no GSA.

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But, you know, the loss of money for the crew.

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So I mean, you did things like that.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I love the crew. I love the construction.

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A lot of funny stories they tell me and had a good time.

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It was good.

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What sort of impact did the living in Indian country make on you?

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, I actually, in Albuquerque, I was living in Albuquerque and I go on the reservation.

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And in the state of Washington, I didn't, you know, I live off reservation.

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But it was more in the state of Washington, more like rural country.

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I love the culture, I love the dances.

281
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And it was a really good experience for me.

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So I, you know, sort of participated in.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I even broke my wrist riding rodeo.

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So I had a little bit of, you know, some good stories to tell.

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So that was good.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What did you think of the Pacific Northwest?

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I've seen that was your first exposure to it.

288
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah. And I only, I was up in the state of Washington.

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And I did drive through Oregon and then went over to the coast.

290
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the thing that impressed me in the coast was it was hard to get down to the beach.

291
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There were so many logs.

292
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean, there were just logs all over the place.

293
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And of course, now there aren't.

294
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I think there were a lot of wasteful timber practices back then.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And the logs were just drifted out.

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But so I really didn't, I didn't, you know, I was in Eastern Washington.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And so it's quite different than Corvallis.

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean, I liked it. I liked the beautiful country.

299
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, after a year or two, I think with that job, you went back to school.

300
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah. I spent a little over a year or two years in public health service.

301
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I went back to New York University, right in the middle of New York City.

302
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Would it change?

303
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I mean, holy mackerel, I'm out in the, you know, out in the sticks and my arms and the cast,

304
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
rodeo accident. I'm ending up ending up in New York, middle of New York City.

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But I did get a good education there at New York University.

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And I got into computer modeling.

307
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And this was back in the mid-60s.

308
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I got into that.

309
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Fortran was pretty new then.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I did sort of learn machine language, which was awful.

311
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Fortran, though, was great.

312
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I had a very good major professor.

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I got into computer simulation long before most people.

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There were no PCs back then.

315
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And there was no internet.

316
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I used to take cards down on the subway to the Greenwich Village.

317
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's where the Quran Institute of Mathematics was.

318
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And they had a big computer, then you'd give them the cards and they'd run it.

319
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then you'd plot by hand the results.

320
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But you got to understand what a model does.

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Because you plot them by hand.

322
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You did them yourself.

323
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You could actually see what was going on in the computer.

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And now a lot of people don't see that.

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They really don't understand that.

326
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And consequently, I think there's a lot of misuse of computer models now.

327
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's what the things were you modeling.

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Lakes and estuaries.

329
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And the thing about estuaries is they're part of the river that's influenced by the ocean.

330
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And the tides come in and out.

331
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They're very dynamic systems of waters changing.

332
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And so before the digital computer,

333
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
you had to make mathematical assumptions of steady state.

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And the sanitary engineers have been doing this since 1925 on rivers,

335
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
building mathematical models long before the scientists were doing it.

336
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And actually, the rivers got better.

337
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They did a lot.

338
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There was a lot of good.

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And that's sort of been airbrushed out of the history.

340
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We may come back to that later because there was a lot of environmental improvements on rivers, in particular, that occurred there.

341
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I was part of that history.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But the 60s, things were changing.

343
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We knew things were changing.

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We saw lakes were having problems.

345
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We saw all sorts of problems.

346
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And so that was a real era of transformation when I got here.

347
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And the computer and a pretty exciting time.

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Was this also your first experience of teaching?

349
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, my first experience in teaching formally,

350
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I used to do some help sessions for some of my classmates back in the M.I.

351
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And my family has a lot of teachers.

352
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And so, you know, I loved it.

353
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So I had, you know, I loved the students and the teaching.

354
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I liked the research.

355
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't like proposal writing.

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We'll come back to that later.

357
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Tell me about living in New York City in the 60s.

358
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, you know, I was mainly involved in graduate school.

359
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And there were some protests.

360
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I generally was not part of that.

361
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
My part of the protest, I was part of, in a sense,

362
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
of let's do something about the problems.

363
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And mainly pollution.

364
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And certainly Martin Luther King Jr. had a profound effect on me.

365
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is a huge transformation.

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And it was, that was a good time.

367
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think that what happened a little bit after that,

368
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the drug scene and other things, I just, I felt like that was very different,

369
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
very self-indulgent, and often destructive.

370
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And so I really, I had mixed feelings.

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I really identified, yes, let's make the world a better place.

372
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But there also seemed to be sort of self-centered naiveness

373
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that was associated with this.

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And maybe a tendency to blame other people rather than saying what can we do.

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So I had a mix, it was a mixed feeling, mixed bag.

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Was this, is it fair to say this was sort of the beginnings of your environmental consciousness that come before?

377
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Environmental consciousness came before, came largely through the churches.

378
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And again, that's been a whole history that they don't talk about.

379
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You probably have read that.

380
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You probably took the history of environmental from Bob McDermott.

381
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And that's just not included.

382
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Well, it was huge.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I mean, here my father would have 300 boys out in this cabins out there,

384
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and they had nature counselors.

385
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Across the river was a lake, was a girls camp,

386
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and then there was another teenage camp, a young adults camp there.

387
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And this was a big thing.

388
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And so I was always taught that respect.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And there was also sort of a technology.

390
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, it's got some good things, but it's got some limitations, too.

391
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we also had that.

392
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And when I got here at Oregon State University,

393
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
it was the campus ministries that were challenging higher education.

394
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There's a guy John Connor, you ought to just do a separate history on John Connor.

395
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And because he probably did more to change Oregon State University than any other person here.

396
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He was the campus minister at Westminster House.

397
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And we would have classes there on environmental problems,

398
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and appropriate technology was a big thing.

399
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And there were some economics theories, Kenneth Bolding and Herman Daley.

400
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Dick Clinton is, if you interview him, he'll tell you about Herman Daley.

401
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And academia just sort of closed that stuff off.

402
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But at the time in the late 60s and early 70s, it was pretty exciting.

403
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
There was a lot of interesting things that were happening.

404
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But that movement died out.

405
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And again, it's sort of been airbrushed out of the history.

406
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I think this is one of the things that's probably important for oral history.

407
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because a lot of historians, they study the archives.

408
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Well, the stuff that may be most important didn't make it into the archives.

409
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Because the big institutions basically don't fund that.

410
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And so it sort of disappears.

411
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So we need to have people take oral history and say, look, here's some good stuff.

412
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And it makes a lot of sense.

413
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Kenneth Bolding, Herman Daley.

414
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I mean, you go back, EF Schumacher, small as beautiful.

415
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I mean, these were books that came in books of writings and speeches that were amazing.

416
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I mean, Kenneth Bolding, he's one of the best speakers I heard on an economist.

417
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And he stuttered terribly.

418
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And you'd sit there and you'd first be nervous.

419
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And then you'd realize that it doesn't bother him, so it didn't bother you.

420
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It was amazing.

421
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And it came up with some really good stuff.

422
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I think if we weren't to know how to deal with some of the environmental problems we have now,

423
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
go back and look at them.

424
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And Kenneth Bolding, he was a quaker.

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Herman Daley, I think, was a Methodist, EF Schumacher, Catholic.

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This was a spiritual movement, but it was certain.

427
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It had nothing to do with intelligent design or evolution or anything like that.

428
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That was never an issue.

429
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And so that's a part of the history.

430
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If people want to understand where we're at now, I think we can go back and say there were some opportunities that were missed that happened.

431
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll come back to some of those.

432
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, tell me about the decision to come to OSU in 1967.

433
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You'd graduated from NYU and you came here.

434
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, I don't think I singled out OSU for any reason.

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
In fact, I had applied to EPA.

436
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And they were going to hire me.

437
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And Don Baumgartner was over EPA.

438
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And the hire me on beautification, study of lakes, and also estuaries.

439
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Don was estuaries, anyhow, aquatic ecosystems.

440
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And somehow that position fell through.

441
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So he sent my resume over to Fred Burgers, who was the Dean of Engineering.

442
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I got this notice, you know, would you like a position here?

443
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So I said, yeah, so I took it.

444
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What was your first impression of the University and of the town?

445
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, I liked it.

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's a beautiful campus, and it still is.

447
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I mean, it's a few ugly buildings.

448
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But generally, I think it's a fantastic campus.

449
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The people were good, friendly.

450
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So I enjoyed it.

451
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What was the department like?

452
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The department was a good department.

453
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was a traditional engineering department.

454
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But I did have some certain amount of freedom.

455
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I started a course on mathematical modeling, computer simulation.

456
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And you look back, and that was a pretty big jump for a lot of the people back then.

457
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Because the digital computer was fairly new, except the military, of course.

458
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And so I had a course there.

459
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I also had a course, a graduate course, got on the books that was something like a philosophy of technology.

460
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So they, you know, they were receptive to this.

461
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And I think my education at VMI helped a little bit because, you know,

462
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
if I felt strongly about something, I told them so.

463
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I think most people appreciated that.

464
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
At least they knew that I wasn't going to back off because I was afraid of raising something unusual.

465
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They didn't even occur to me.

466
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So I did get some courses taught then.

467
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And at that time, I had the mightest touch.

468
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I could get research grants.

469
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I mean, I was just, you know, I couldn't believe it.

470
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now they weren't big grants like you get now.

471
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But I had, on estuaries, I had one.

472
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And then I had eutrification as it lakes.

473
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What happens to lakes? It was a computer simulation.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And I got that.

475
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And I had another interesting one.

476
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And we'll talk a little more about that.

477
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And that was environmental strategies under indeterminancy.

478
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I think that's what the title was.

479
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And they even funded that one.

480
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It was a small grant.

481
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But then the strange things happened.

482
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
As my awareness started to expand, the funding agency started to go narrower.

483
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And by the end of the 70s, things have changed.

484
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Things have really changed.

485
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What do you think happened?

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Well, that's a good story.

487
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And that's the one the historians have to look at.

488
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Now there are some historians here.

489
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Army Mother Nature, Jacob Darwin, Hamlin, great name.

490
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Jacob Darwin, I love it.

491
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And he's written a very good book.

492
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And it's about how the environmental movement,

493
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
or the environmental science, more, environmental science.

494
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And particularly big computer models, came out of the military.

495
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And I didn't know that at that time.

496
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But my background was out of the sanitary engineering.

497
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So it was a whole different background.

498
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And what happened is their way of doing it took over.

499
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And the way we were doing it shrunk.

500
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so what they were saying is,

501
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
well, we'll build big computer models.

502
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm simplifying it.

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And that's how we'll approach the future.

504
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Well, I was in a computer model.

505
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And I said, you can't do...

506
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I mean, yeah, build computer models.

507
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But you cannot have environmental strategies

508
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
based on prediction and control.

509
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The world is too complex.

510
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And so what we did during this study,

511
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
what I did during this study,

512
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
environmental strategies under indeterminacy,

513
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I said, look, we have a strategy.

514
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's very simple.

515
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You don't need big models.

516
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You could build big models,

517
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
but you need a strategy.

518
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And the strategy is, we will make mistakes.

519
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Okay? That's called confession.

520
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay.

521
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And so what you have to do is learn how to make good mistakes.

522
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And a good mistake is, say, reversible.

523
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Good mistakes are, once you learn from,

524
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
good mistakes are ones where you don't get painted in a box.

525
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So we came up with a strategy like this.

526
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And it all made very good sense.

527
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And it does to this day.

528
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean, you take carbon dioxide, the greenhouse warm.

529
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
People still trying to predict their models

530
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
are all over the place if you go far out.

531
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But the CO2 impact is almost irreversible.

532
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And it's just shooting through the sky.

533
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So under that strategy, we would have said,

534
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
you got to stop.

535
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You can't wait till you find out what the impacts are.

536
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's too late.

537
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The world is changing faster than you can develop your predictions.

538
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I thought it all made sense.

539
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So they send, when I write my file report in 78,

540
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and I got a copy of it.

541
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
One in the file.

542
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
They send the guy out there to look over my shoulder

543
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and write it.

544
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And this is strange.

545
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That never happened before.

546
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And I thought maybe it was because

547
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
when Senator Proxmeyer's Golden Fleece awards,

548
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
he would ridicule scientific projects.

549
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But I realize now after some of the history books coming out,

550
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
the paradigms were changing.

551
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
They were saying we want big scale computer models.

552
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And I was in the modeling.

553
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So the guy looked over my shoulder and said,

554
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
OK.

555
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And I thought he was pleased with the report.

556
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
When he was.

557
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But when he left, he said,

558
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
we'll never fund anything like this again.

559
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I go, why?

560
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Our shot.

561
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We don't have a box to put it in.

562
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
This is the answer.

563
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Now, I didn't realize at that time that

564
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that's what the transformation was occurring.

565
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You're building big boxes.

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
They have all these little specialized areas to do certain tasks

567
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to fit them to the models.

568
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And we weren't looking at this.

569
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Now, one of the guys I work with on here is Scott Overton.

570
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Did you interview Scott?

571
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No.

572
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh, it's a shame.

573
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
He passed away.

574
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But there is a website.

575
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You really ought to take a look at it.

576
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Very impressive guy.

577
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And Scott and I, probably at Oregon State

578
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
between the two of us at the time.

579
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We published a paper in 72.

580
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And we probably had a more environmental computer modeling

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
than any other to it in the university.

582
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And we basically came up with a strategy that was not based on

583
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
prediction and control.

584
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And avoid large scale irreversible change.

585
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You have to do that because you don't know what the consequences

586
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
are to be.

587
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So when you make a mistake, you want to make a good mistake,

588
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
which means you can reverse it.

589
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
CO2 doesn't reverse.

590
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I mean, it's up there for centuries.

591
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's sad.

592
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Tell me about Overton.

593
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Overton, Scott Overton, statistics and forest management.

594
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And Scott, he was very disciplined.

595
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
In fact, there were people in statistics.

596
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I think they were afraid of him.

597
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And a good guy.

598
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Very thoughtful person.

599
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Very rigorous.

600
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Very rigorous.

601
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And he was a few years old in my...

602
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
He was a scouting or work too, I think.

603
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And how he can look up his background.

604
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Statistics and forest management.

605
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
He just was good.

606
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So we got together.

607
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And we started talking about this.

608
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And we said, let's write a paper on it.

609
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And it was published in the American Society Civil Engineers,

610
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
a sanitary engineering division.

611
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It really wasn't...

612
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Environmental science was just sort of...

613
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, was it really out there?

614
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Scott had a student, Larry Hunt.

615
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And I think, early 70s, he did his PhD.

616
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And he had to do it in forest management.

617
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There was no ecology.

618
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But it was in ecology, you know, PhD.

619
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
We had a graduate faculty of ecology.

620
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
We were sort of fighting the system.

621
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And during his...

622
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
One of his last meetings in March is a group of faculty

623
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
from forest management, complaining that he didn't take

624
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the road design courses and the cable design,

625
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
all the stuff about logging.

626
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And well, he had a powerful committee,

627
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and there was a dean of forestry.

628
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think his name was Stolenberg.

629
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I have to give the guy credit.

630
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
He picked up the body language of our committee

631
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
that we were going to fight for this guy.

632
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And so he was very diplomatic, but he says,

633
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
this time, we'll arrange this so we got him through.

634
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So Larry Hunt was probably one of the first ones

635
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to actually get a PhD in ecology.

636
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So there were other people who had done things in biology.

637
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But it was generally...

638
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's not, you know, like it is now.

639
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So that was interesting.

640
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about the climate

641
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
on campus in the late 60s.

642
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Obviously it was raging.

643
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
There was a lot of tumult nationwide.

644
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What was your sense of the environment on campus itself?

645
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
There wasn't...

646
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't think...

647
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think relative to other places, there was probably less.

648
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But I think some of the inquiry sort of maybe lasted a little longer.

649
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So it's like some other places burn out quicker.

650
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
My contact was largely through the campus ministries.

651
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And they were really...

652
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
They were really active all the way into the 70s.

653
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
In fact, even beyond that.

654
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I can remember having a course over in Westminster House.

655
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And so I knew the...

656
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Colonel of the...

657
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
ROTC Colonel, Kurt Rosler, I think, was his name.

658
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And he...

659
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I was probably late 70s, I'm guessing.

660
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And I may have the day off, but you can look him up.

661
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
His picture's up there.

662
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And he was a tank commander.

663
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And so this is the Cold War.

664
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And during Cold War, Soviet tanks were...

665
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I mean, armed divisions.

666
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They were powerful.

667
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
This was a major concern.

668
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So I brought him over to one of these classes.

669
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And there were a whole lot of what we call hippies.

670
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And in this class.

671
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And he just wore sweater casual, civilian clothes.

672
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And he started talking with them.

673
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And they didn't want to like him.

674
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But they did.

675
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He was a good guy.

676
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And I remember asking him the question.

677
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What is more danger to American society?

678
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The Soviet tank or the American gas-guzzling car.

679
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And he said, oh, that's easy.

680
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's the car.

681
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And so...

682
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I mean, we had those kinds of discussions that were going on.

683
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
They sort of ended late 80s.

684
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
We put on a conference on Eisenhower's farewell address.

685
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
He warns about the military industrial complex.

686
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But people don't realize he also warned about the university.

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The danger is that the pursuit of government grants and contracts

688
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
will be pursued so much that intellectual curiosity

689
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
will be given up.

690
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We must guard against scientific technological elite.

691
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And then later after that he says only an informed and knowledgeable citizenry

692
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
can prevent this from happening.

693
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, he has some powerful stuff.

694
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So we did a whole conference on that.

695
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And one of the things we did in that conference, Craig Walker.

696
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You can interview him.

697
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
He's the layer.

698
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
He gave you a copy of the book.

699
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We did on it.

700
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
He and I wrote a chapter at the end.

701
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And we said, suppose George Bush gave this con.

702
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Because George Bush...

703
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
The first George Bush was President then.

704
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And not George W.

705
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That was his father.

706
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And so what we did is we took portions of the speech.

707
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And we just said, suppose George Bush wrote this.

708
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And the only thing we'll change is his warning is not about the military

709
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
industrial complex.

710
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's the oil industrial complex.

711
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And so we changed.

712
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And it's really a radical.

713
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It comes across really radical.

714
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Well, you can take that and take it for his son.

715
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You can take it and give that speech now.

716
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And he was warning.

717
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I mean, is it remarkable with Eisenhower?

718
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
His whole life was in the military industrial complex.

719
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And his final warning is warning about it.

720
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I was very impressed with that.

721
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And your sense was always he was falling prey to these warnings?

722
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Oh, yeah.

723
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I think pursuit of research.

724
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's not just over-su, but I think higher education in general.

725
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I mean, pursuit of research.

726
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I mean, we're graded when I was there.

727
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Research.

728
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean, I don't know whether anybody read the papers.

729
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But you sure had to put a list on how much money you brought in.

730
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I think that's pretty, pretty common right now.

731
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And so you bring in more money.

732
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And I said, this is strange.

733
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You know, we're being rewarded for spending more money.

734
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Why don't we say, look, gee, I did all this interesting stuff.

735
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And I didn't spend very much of the taxpayers' money.

736
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I mean, it seemed to me that would make sense.

737
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But it didn't work that way.

738
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Was the paper with Overton in 72?

739
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is that sort of the beginning of the system's theory work?

740
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Well, the system's theory work.

741
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
First of all, in the computer modeling and ecosystems,

742
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I was doing ecosystems.

743
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So I was involved in systems.

744
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I was involved in some ecologist or limnologist,

745
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
G. Evelyn Hutchinson.

746
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And there were a number of people,

747
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
the ecology, the beginning of ecology.

748
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So I had used some of their work, met some of those people.

749
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And I was coming at it.

750
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But I began to realize that

751
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
the rivers aren't the problem.

752
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The trees aren't the problem.

753
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The fish aren't the problem.

754
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It's the human systems that are the problem.

755
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So I began to realize this in the 70s,

756
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
maybe even a little before that.

757
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And so what I started doing was studying human systems.

758
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Now, if you're going to study human systems,

759
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
kind of, you make a choice.

760
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm in a computer.

761
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So I can sit behind a computer, of course,

762
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
they didn't have the computer screens,

763
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
but now, of course, they do.

764
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Or I can actually get out in the organizational systems.

765
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And see what's happening.

766
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I chose that second route.

767
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And that was actually a conscious choice.

768
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm going to collect experiences.

769
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm not going to be sitting eventually once they got computer screens.

770
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm not going to be sitting behind a computer screen.

771
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So I never had email on campus.

772
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Never.

773
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Never.

774
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I have some at home now.

775
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Will Gamble, you can interview him.

776
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I don't know if he will, but he did either.

777
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So we were probably the last ones.

778
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But I'm working with these computer systems.

779
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Now, when you work with these computer systems,

780
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
there's a whole level of mathematics today

781
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
that you can do non-linear dynamics, emergence,

782
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
that you can't do with traditional mathematics.

783
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And I can explain it, take me about three for a minute,

784
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
explain it, because I'd have to explain differential equations.

785
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But basically, you couldn't solve the equations.

786
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And what you would do with differential equations,

787
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
you start out with initial condition,

788
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
you tell the rates of change, and then you can make a prediction.

789
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But with certain equations, non-linear,

790
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
particularly if they're, say, three-dimensional,

791
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
so you're going to see in space what the predictions are.

792
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You end up with the things going around like this.

793
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's called chaos.

794
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And you end up with essentially,

795
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the world is just not that predictable.

796
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And then you're throwing complexity.

797
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And so, over to the night, we're onto that, 72.

798
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If you look up the references,

799
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I think the title had one plus one does not equal two.

800
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
That is, the whole cannot be reduced to the sum of the parts.

801
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And the other one was a paper by Warren Weaver that basically said,

802
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
science does not know how to deal with problems of organized complexity.

803
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So I was into the math, because with the digital computer,

804
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
you can approximate the solution to equations that you cannot solve.

805
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So you don't solve them.

806
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You get finite difference numerical methods and approximations.

807
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That's what all computer simulations are doing now.

808
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
They don't solve equations like they do in differential equations.

809
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They can't even come close.

810
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
But the non-linear behave in weird ways.

811
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I mean, the non-linear world is bizarre.

812
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And it's only bizarre because for several hundred years,

813
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
we've been taught to think linearly.

814
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And when you're taught to think linearly,

815
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
then when something non-linear comes up, it's seen as bizarre.

816
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So I would meet with a guy, John Goman.

817
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
If you ever get a chance, he'd be a good one to interview.

818
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
He was a campus minister here.

819
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And the best description of John is he's a medieval monk transported by a time machine.

820
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So he never passed through the analytical age of, say, Newton and Galileo,

821
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the analysis breaking it down into parts.

822
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
He thought holistically, you know?

823
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And he didn't have any trouble with this.

824
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We had these discussions for years.

825
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
The students would just come and people would come and we'd have these discussions.

826
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And so the non-linear world is a strange world.

827
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's a world that requires you to think more with the right hemisphere of your brain.

828
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Ian McGillcrest has a great video, people should look that up, the divided brain.

829
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And he says the left hemisphere is sequential linear.

830
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And we have become a dominated by left brain thinking.

831
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I think that's true.

832
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And he describes, what would happen?

833
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
What kind of organization would you get if it was dominated by left hemisphere?

834
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And he describes, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a university.

835
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So the right hemisphere system, the world is so, you know, amazing.

836
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
There's things emerged.

837
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So anyhow, that's the stuff I got into.

838
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But I wanted to get into it from a human perspective, big organizations.

839
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I didn't want to stay in the mathematical modeling.

840
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I kept teaching, I had to make a living.

841
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I kept teaching the computer modeling.

842
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And I enjoyed it. I enjoyed teaching.

843
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But when I teach even engineering mechanics, I almost never brought in notes.

844
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The interact with the students.

845
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And the best classes occurred when the class went in the direction that I didn't even anticipate.

846
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And I just got to keep my life.

847
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And then the eyes light up when they get something that's great.

848
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It strikes me that you're placing an imperative on getting away from the computer screen

849
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and getting out and interacting with people.

850
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It falls the same model that your father took.

851
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah, I think that's probably true.

852
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Really, he really did.

853
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
He majored in physics, which at that time, physics.

854
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's tough.

855
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Because physics, that time was going through a huge change.

856
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And I brought him when he retired a pendulum.

857
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And it has several magnets.

858
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So it's non-linear.

859
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It doesn't just swing back and forth.

860
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It just goes in this.

861
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And when he looked at that his eyes lit up and he just laughed and he says,

862
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
that would have driven my professors crazy.

863
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, so I did that.

864
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It also sounds like there's a divergence between the curriculum that you're teaching

865
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
or being compelled to teach in your research interests.

866
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Oh, it's opposite directions.

867
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
If I take my career at Oregon State,

868
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I put all my accomplishments in two piles.

869
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
A, that got me promotion and tenure.

870
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It was full professor, tenure, all the rest of this.

871
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
A, right over here.

872
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Pile B over here didn't go anywhere within your organization.

873
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Not very, not very far.

874
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
The most important pile is B.

875
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You can throw out all the rest.

876
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Now I learned a lot by teaching engineering mechanics.

877
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And you learn a lot, for example, in mechanics courses.

878
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The way we teach the math isn't that important.

879
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You have to teach students how to sketch.

880
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Make a sketch.

881
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's called a free body diagram.

882
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Ask any student who's taking it.

883
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You have to draw it.

884
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So how do you make a sketch?

885
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
How do you think?

886
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
How do you do that?

887
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And you engage the students in that, you know, making the simple sketches.

888
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So when I went to study human systems, I'm going to make sketches.

889
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Because you see a sketch is two-dimensional, okay?

890
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You know, it goes two-dimensional sketch.

891
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Now you can make a three-dimensional.

892
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That's not too hard to go to three-dimensional.

893
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But going from one dimension, which is a written text,

894
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
to two dimensions is a huge difference.

895
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's just a huge difference.

896
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I mean, you can talk about something as perpendicular in two dimensions.

897
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And that means this dimension cannot be reduced to this dimension.

898
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
They're orthogonal.

899
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Well, in one-dimensional lines of reasoning, you can't do that.

900
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I mean, you can sort of say it, but you don't see it.

901
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So the average, typical book is what?

902
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
About a half mile long.

903
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's all one line. It's only arranged on pages for convenience.

904
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And so that shapes the way we think.

905
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We think in lines.

906
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And the world does not behave in lines.

907
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
The world is much more of this way.

908
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Now, if you go on a construction site, and I learned this my first job,

909
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
they give you a set of specs, all lines written, and a set of drawings.

910
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I almost never looked at the specs.

911
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I was all over those drawings.

912
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And if you go out on the construction site, watch construction on campus,

913
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and you'll see people using body language, you'll see them taking out diagrams.

914
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
They're not sitting around studying texts.

915
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Professors do that, but they could never build a building like that.

916
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Well, I'm wondering if the systems theory, I mean, my impression anyway,

917
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I could be wrong about this, but it was sort of kind of the spine of your work.

918
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And that went off in a lot of different kind of more topical directions,

919
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
or kind of current events, e-types, directions, is that true?

920
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Well, my work, I finally, a lot of the work in systems now is going highly sophisticated mathematics.

921
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And the study of emergence, for example,

922
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
the best people of biology is Stuart Kaufman.

923
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And he's done randomized Boolean networks.

924
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
He did some things that's mathematical.

925
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And it's pretty good.

926
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So, you know, I've done some of that.

927
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But I go, what's the point in all the math?

928
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I mean, if we're trying to understand the world that people are living in,

929
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
then we ought to be able to communicate to them,

930
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
because they know more about that world than we do.

931
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So, what I do is I make sketches.

932
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Okay?

933
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And you make sketches.

934
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And now I'll do, like, 10 statements on a sketch.

935
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And simple statements connected by arrows, so they loops.

936
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Okay?

937
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And I'll get people, if I can get them to read it,

938
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
the people who read it and I go,

939
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
you just describe my life.

940
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
This is what's going on.

941
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
So, one of them that I did was how information gets distorted in organizations.

942
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The classic example explanation we give is blame.

943
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Look at the Veterans Administration.

944
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Okay.

945
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Information was distorted.

946
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So, what do they do?

947
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They fire Eric Shinseki.

948
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I mean, he's got to be one of the most honest straightforward guys you can imagine.

949
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I mean, he's an honorable person.

950
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I mean that, in the best sense of the word.

951
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And you listen to Congress, and everybody's blaming everybody.

952
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So, what I did is I made a simple sketch

953
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and how organization is a system.

954
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And it provides a context within which everybody finds reasons to behave in their own particular way.

955
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But the system is a whole distorts information.

956
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Okay.

957
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That's what I do.

958
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And that everybody inside of it has a good reason.

959
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And they're ordinary people like us.

960
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So, I've done that.

961
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Regional one in late 70s.

962
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And first I didn't publish it, but the model sort of circulated.

963
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
People would send me.

964
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I got a Xerox of a Xerox.

965
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Can you send me a copy?

966
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So, then in 1986, I think it was the shuttle blew up.

967
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And I'm watching television, and I see Richard Feynman.

968
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And he's trying to explain what's going on.

969
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And I go, he's describing my model.

970
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I never studied NASA.

971
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So, I send them a copy of the diagram and this table.

972
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And I didn't know he was dying a stomach cancer.

973
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I think it was stomach cancer at the time.

974
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I wish I would have thanked him.

975
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So, if you want to thank someone, thank him quick.

976
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
When they die, he can't.

977
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'll do it now.

978
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Thanks, Richard.

979
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Okay.

980
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And he read it and he wrote me back this letter.

981
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And he says, I read this table and I'm amazed.

982
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Perfect prediction.

983
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
No, I don't use perfect prediction.

984
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But if you're Richard Feynman, you can use perfect prediction.

985
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And he says, I didn't realize that NASA was part of a general phenomena.

986
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Now, technically, if I said that, we say that's a grammatical error, a phenomena.

987
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
If Richard Feynman says it, it's brilliant.

988
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Okay.

989
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So, then I started publishing it.

990
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Now, next month, August, I'll be going to Quebec City for the American Fisheries Society to present this model.

991
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Okay.

992
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I had to figure out how to do it on a PowerPoint now because there's going to be 2,500 people.

993
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And I've got half an hour.

994
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So, that's a little, I like to interact, but you don't interact with 2,500 people.

995
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So, anyhow, I draw these models and when people can understand them and they see it,

996
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
then they can start telling you, because they know more about the experience in the world than I do,

997
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
they can start telling you.

998
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And to a large extent, what I'm doing is I'm providing an alternative to blame,

999
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
looking at these larger systems.

1000
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Now, it's consistent with a lot of the mathematics that's going on.

1001
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's just that you can experience it in life.

1002
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And if the world is nonlinear and emerging, we are experiencing it.

1003
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
We have to open up our eyes.

1004
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
When one looks at sort of an abstract of your veto, there are issues that are mostly in the past now.

1005
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I'm wondering if what you've just described as, if these are examples of it having been,

1006
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
that model having been applied in the past of things like space-based weaponry.

1007
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Yeah, I will see.

1008
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
That's an interesting.

1009
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
About the 1980s, somewhere in the 1980s,

1010
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I was really getting frustrated with the environmental.

1011
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Because, you know, that's about the time that they started the global warming.

1012
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
We will make predictive models.

1013
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And scientists may say, well, we really weren't, no, no.

1014
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That's the way the objectives were written.

1015
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I went back and looked at the original documents.

1016
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And we'll develop predictive models.

1017
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And I said, no, you won't.

1018
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So I got frustrated.

1019
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So I wanted to learn more about large-scale computer systems.

1020
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And that can I understand organizations by just observing.

1021
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So I went and I spent six years, Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program.

1022
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And I had no funding.

1023
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So I could go to the meetings and I didn't have to hustle any money.

1024
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And, oh, you go to these meetings and, you know, these consultants, they're always have to hustle money.

1025
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And so I could ask these questions.

1026
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And I said, I want to see if I can, as a citizen,

1027
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
if I can find something, make a contribution here to something that they don't see.

1028
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And I did finds I did.

1029
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I could.

1030
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And that's a whole other story.

1031
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And involves some interesting characters, including Richard Cheney,

1032
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
who was Secretary of Defense at the time.

1033
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So Richard Garwin, who designed the hydrogen bomb, interesting, really interesting guy.

1034
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So I met some interesting people and I did some interesting things.

1035
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But I was mainly interested in these human systems and how,

1036
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
and then large-scale technological ones and how we can lose control.

1037
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I mean, the control was sort of often in illusion.

1038
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You referenced earlier John Conner in Westminster House,

1039
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
in the local environmental movement.

1040
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You want to talk more about him in that period of time?

1041
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah, John Conner was a campus minister.

1042
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
He had been a minister in Mexico.

1043
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Turns out he, I found out years later that he, he knew my cousin in Raton.

1044
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I think it was Raton in Mexico.

1045
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And he had, John was, was very tall and I had this long beard.

1046
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And he just would raise all sorts of questions.

1047
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
He raised all sorts of questions.

1048
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
He'd just be bouncing around and he'd sort of stir up the pop.

1049
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And we, at that particular time, there was a whole national movement

1050
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:58,000
where theology or mainline churches were challenging higher education.

1051
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
There's a book on a Douglas Sloan in Columbia University.

1052
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's called Faith in Knowledge.

1053
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And probably out of print now.

1054
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But it's a very good book.

1055
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And they, they were challenging higher education.

1056
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And what Sloan writes about is that went on for about two decades.

1057
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And Eisenhower's warning is sort of right in the middle of that.

1058
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So there was a time in there where people are looking at the problems of technology.

1059
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yes, it has good things, but we have to recognize its limitations too.

1060
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And there was sort of this attitude there.

1061
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So John played a key role in that.

1062
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And he was mainly the facilitator of it.

1063
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,000
He was the moderator of the Presbyterian Church, which is, I guess, their highest position.

1064
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And he would, you know, he did a lot of interesting things.

1065
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:09,000
But for me, it was like he was sort of at the focal point of the center of the whirlwind,

1066
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
where all interesting things were happening.

1067
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So that was a very important time.

1068
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And there were concepts that came up then.

1069
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Very, very important.

1070
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I wrote a paper published in 2006 on evil.

1071
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
He said, ah, evil, I didn't talk about it.

1072
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Well, this was a secular term.

1073
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I mean, it's on emergency evils, the title of it.

1074
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And I used concepts from theology in there.

1075
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And no one raised any concern.

1076
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You know, they were helping us to understand this phenomena.

1077
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And basically, I was saying that evil, large patterns emerge.

1078
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And ordinary people like you and I get caught up within them.

1079
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And in biblical language, that would be bondage and blindness.

1080
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
You're caught up within it.

1081
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And you can't transcend it, transcend the context, the system that you're caught up within.

1082
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And horrible things could be done.

1083
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And the example I used was the Soviet biological warfare system.

1084
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And then horrible, horrible things.

1085
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And by some top scientists, so scientists can get caught up in it just like anybody else.

1086
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Anyhow, that, you know, that probably has goes back in some ways to John Connor.

1087
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It's interesting how often you've been working with church groups.

1088
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm under French.

1089
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It's French and church groups.

1090
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I don't go regularly to the services.

1091
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
There, see, part of it, I'm studying models.

1092
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Well, I learned models as a kid.

1093
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
They were called parables.

1094
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
A parable is a model.

1095
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
All models are simplifications.

1096
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And what they do is help to clarify some matters of importance, not all.

1097
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And they expose their limitations.

1098
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay?

1099
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So a parable is a story.

1100
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And what you do is you get engaged in the power you learn as a kid.

1101
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
You don't think much of it.

1102
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You engage in it.

1103
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And as you're going through life, you begin to see something.

1104
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And that's what the purpose of a good model really is.

1105
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That you play with it.

1106
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You engage in it.

1107
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And then it allows you to become aware of something.

1108
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And it's very different than having a big computer that no one knows what it's doing.

1109
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And it spits out data.

1110
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So in that sense, what I was involved in was had its roots there in parables.

1111
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But also in engineering, you know,

1112
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,000
scientists act like all the stuff that we build here and all the stuff that comes out of science.

1113
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Okay?

1114
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And well, I would say yes, but I taught engineering mechanics.

1115
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
This is Newtonian mechanics.

1116
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
When engineers build like the buildings on campus, just go watch them.

1117
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
They're amazing.

1118
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
They build them on campus.

1119
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Okay?

1120
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
We also use safety factors.

1121
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And we don't talk about students don't know about this.

1122
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And where do safety factors come from?

1123
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
They come from confession and repentance.

1124
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
You know, confession and repentance is an anile awful.

1125
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It's not self-blame.

1126
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It means you've done something and there's a failure.

1127
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
What are you going to do?

1128
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
You admit to the failure and you change your ways.

1129
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And that's how you learn.

1130
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That's how you learn how to ride a bike.

1131
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You don't study bicycle riding, the theory of bicycle riding,

1132
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and pass a quiz, a multiple grade, you know, a multiple choice quiz,

1133
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
and say, now I'm a bike rider, you can get on it and you fall down.

1134
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
That's how life is.

1135
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And so in engineering, simple engineering in particular, if you look at the history,

1136
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
you see all these pictures of bridges that fell down.

1137
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You begin to say, what's going on here?

1138
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
That's how we learn.

1139
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And there's a historian engineering.

1140
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And he has some statements.

1141
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
See, I read one the other day,

1142
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
behind almost every success is a history of failure, something like this.

1143
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well, that's probably pretty good theology, too.

1144
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So there's been a whole part.

1145
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It's not about belief systems.

1146
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And even churches get that wrong.

1147
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You know, the word belief is a modern word.

1148
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You know, the word religion, even.

1149
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I mean, it's a new word.

1150
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I mean, new in the last 700 years.

1151
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
As a system of belief, it just doesn't make sense.

1152
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So what you learned were stories and parables.

1153
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And you went out into the world and you made mistakes.

1154
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Guess what?

1155
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
So that's how you learn.

1156
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So when I come back to some stuff that I learned in church

1157
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and stuff that I learned in engineering

1158
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
and stuff that I learned in environment,

1159
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
there are some common themes.

1160
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Now, what's absent is some of this foolishness

1161
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
like intelligent design or things like this.

1162
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And this is just a big distraction.

1163
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I mean, John Conner had no problem with evolution.

1164
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
My father didn't.

1165
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Now, maybe his father maybe did, but a lot of people did.

1166
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Things changed.

1167
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So I've sort of been on the fringe of some,

1168
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I guess you can call theological insights.

1169
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
They're pretty cool.

1170
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
There's some interesting ones.

1171
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And they're not about belief systems.

1172
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
One of the things you find now, for example,

1173
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
is how Buddhism and Christianity have...

1174
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Parts of it just sort of come together

1175
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and rediscovered each other.

1176
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And you take a guy like Richard Roer,

1177
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
who's a Franciscan Catholic.

1178
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And he will talk about the Dalai Lama,

1179
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Techno Han.

1180
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I mean, it's just like the boxes we put people in,

1181
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
it just doesn't make sense.

1182
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So yeah.

1183
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Tell me about the Swallowed Camel Club.

1184
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Oh, the Swallowed Camel Club.

1185
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Okay.

1186
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Okay, the Swallowed Camel Club.

1187
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
We had a group that was spontaneously many years ago.

1188
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I don't know how many.

1189
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
The first of the library,

1190
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and we were making almost too much noise.

1191
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And so we started meeting over

1192
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
at St. Ansemps,

1193
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
this Episcopal Campus of History,

1194
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
because John Conner, our time, John Goldman,

1195
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
was John Goldman.

1196
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And he's the guy that's medieval monk.

1197
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And we were, people were,

1198
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
we raised certain questions and say,

1199
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I say, well, are you getting this in your classes?

1200
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I go, no.

1201
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So if you really want to find out what's being taught,

1202
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
you have to ask the students.

1203
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Ask the students.

1204
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So this stuff on complexity,

1205
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and all the rest of these big scale systems,

1206
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
those, you know,

1207
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
they're not addressing all things.

1208
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Not really.

1209
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Not in a way that registers with the students.

1210
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I mean, the student.

1211
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Okay.

1212
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
So we've had these discussions.

1213
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
So what are we going to call our group?

1214
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Well, there's an ancient criticism of university professors.

1215
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
You blind guides.

1216
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You strain out a mat and swallow a camel.

1217
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Okay?

1218
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It's Gospel St. Matthew.

1219
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Okay.

1220
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And it's right hemisphere.

1221
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It's got a metaphor.

1222
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Blind guide.

1223
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You strain out a mat.

1224
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Swallow a camel.

1225
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Three metaphors.

1226
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
That's the right.

1227
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And he puts them together in irony and humor.

1228
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And yet people go, yeah.

1229
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So obviously a camel is not the sum of a lot of little nets.

1230
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
So it's not linear.

1231
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
So anyhow, we would laugh in sort of a joke

1232
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
we call it the Swallow Camel Club.

1233
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And we're not meeting this summer.

1234
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's going on pretty strong.

1235
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
The last several months, though, we've sort of dropped off

1236
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
in part of it.

1237
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I've been working on some other stuff.

1238
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And part John Goldman has retired.

1239
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Physical church has gone through some changes.

1240
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So I'm not sure where it's going to go.

1241
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
But it has gone on for years.

1242
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And there's still, I got an email list of 30, 40 people who

1243
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
belong to it.

1244
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And I sent it out.

1245
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Did you have any contact with Catherine Jeffers-Sory?

1246
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah, a little bit of contact with Catherine Jeffers-Sory.

1247
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And Dick Shory, he was in mathematics or husband

1248
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and nonlinear dynamics.

1249
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
But not much on this.

1250
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Not much on this.

1251
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
She's done an outstanding job.

1252
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And certainly on not a physical panel,

1253
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
but making the physical church certainly more open.

1254
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
The Gays and Lesbians.

1255
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And she's really done that and had to fight some battles.

1256
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And she does it very, very graciously.

1257
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Very graciously.

1258
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I would say, I'd love to get.

1259
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
She also has a PhD in oceanography.

1260
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I would also be fun to have in conversation

1261
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
with the her and the Marcus Borg,

1262
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
or even Marcus Borg.

1263
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Because I would be a little more questioning of science

1264
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
than I think they are.

1265
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's not that science is back.

1266
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It's just that there's a lot of specialization

1267
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and a lot of claims.

1268
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It does wonderful things.

1269
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
But not everything.

1270
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And we could have an interesting discussion on that.

1271
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I want to ask you about a couple of kind of bullet points

1272
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
from your beat of past research interests

1273
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
that I think have particular book ability

1274
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
to people in this state.

1275
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
The first one is an issue that's been important to folks.

1276
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
My set of state needs an organ that's destruction

1277
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
of chemical weapons.

1278
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Oh, yeah.

1279
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
That was an interesting story.

1280
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So I got invited on this one.

1281
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I actually got paid for this one.

1282
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'm not a whole lot.

1283
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
But a lot of the work I did I didn't get paid for.

1284
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I just did it.

1285
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And I make my living teaching.

1286
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
The United States had millions of literally millions

1287
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
and millions of chemical munitions stored all over.

1288
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And I mean, they say their weapons,

1289
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
most of them are not usable.

1290
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And one of them, for example, the M-55 rocket.

1291
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
They made half a million of them.

1292
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
It's about a seven foot rocket.

1293
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And it's not guided.

1294
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And they don't even have launchers.

1295
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And the thing I think tends to go like this.

1296
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So they got all these rockets.

1297
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Well, what are you going to do with them?

1298
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And they have the warheads

1299
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
with the chemical agent inside of it.

1300
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
So you've got like a liquid and you've got a birch there,

1301
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
because it's an aerosol.

1302
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
So I'm not really a gas.

1303
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And then you've got solid booster rocket.

1304
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And they've riveted the warheads on.

1305
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So they can't just unscrew them.

1306
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
So they have to get rid of them.

1307
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So I was part of an independent team

1308
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
to review the risk analysis.

1309
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Because they want to know whether they should ship them off site

1310
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
or destroy them on site and incineration

1311
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
or all the rest of this.

1312
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Well, one of the things I looked at was the M-55 rocket.

1313
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And they had these big steel insulated containers

1314
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
to transport them in.

1315
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And they had on wood pallets.

1316
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So I don't know if they might have had 15 on a pallet.

1317
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
So they had 15 or 30 inside when it's big.

1318
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And they had tests so they could drop it from 20 feet.

1319
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And if there's a fire could insulate.

1320
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
They went through all these accident scenarios.

1321
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Well, the way they do risk analysis

1322
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
is they break it down into different little what's the probability of this.

1323
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
They assign somebody this job.

1324
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
What's the probability of this?

1325
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And they put them all together to find the probability of an accident occurring,

1326
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
which requires maybe three or four or five different things happening.

1327
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
So it's a low probability.

1328
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And they had a lot of this stuff to have to pull out in the air.

1329
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Like what's the probability of an airplane crashing into one of these igles

1330
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
or these storage bins?

1331
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Well, they have to figure out how many planes crashing and pulling out of the air.

1332
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So the one I came up with is

1333
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
OK, what happens to the rockets if there is a train wreck?

1334
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Well, don't worry.

1335
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
There's the warhead.

1336
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
You know, we've checked the warhead on this thing.

1337
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And the warhead won't go off.

1338
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I said, I'm not worried about that.

1339
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
What are you worried about?

1340
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm worried about the rocket igniting inside.

1341
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And it turns out that when they set up the system,

1342
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
they didn't put a box for that.

1343
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So it goes, oh, that won't happen.

1344
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That won't happen.

1345
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So you go into a meeting and when they say, oh, that won't happen,

1346
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
wait for the coffee break.

1347
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Wait for the coffee break because then somebody comes up,

1348
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
why don't you go check?

1349
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I've heard this.

1350
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
They say this.

1351
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So anyhow, I end up in Tweli, Utah.

1352
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And they're going to go in on a tour

1353
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
of the incineration.

1354
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
But you have to wear a cast mask.

1355
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And they wouldn't mean to shave my beard.

1356
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I said, I don't want to shave my beard.

1357
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So we'll leave you out here.

1358
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
We'll just leave you with this guy.

1359
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
That's good.

1360
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
They'll leave you with somebody.

1361
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
This guy tests these warheads.

1362
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Very ingenious design of the warhead, you know,

1363
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
the fuse, the fuse.

1364
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
But in the process, I learn that,

1365
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
but I was concerned is inside, if you have a crash,

1366
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and all these rockets start smashing around,

1367
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
then you take steel and you bend it.

1368
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It gives off heat.

1369
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So is it possible that in the twisting of the metal,

1370
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
you'll get enough heat to ignite the rocket?

1371
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Because all the rocket really is,

1372
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
all the booster inside a steel tube

1373
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
and is a slow explosion.

1374
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The gas goes out the bottom.

1375
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
So I had done some calculations, rough calculations.

1376
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
How much heat would be given off the puncture to steel casing,

1377
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and then how much temperature would rise in the steel

1378
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
right around it, and compared that to the ignition temperature

1379
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
of the rocket, and it was higher.

1380
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So people would say, oh, there's no data on that.

1381
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
When they say there's no data,

1382
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
that may mean we've never seen the data,

1383
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
or we've never collected the data.

1384
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be.

1385
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Anyhow, I find out that to this guy,

1386
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and I get the field notes,

1387
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
that they test these rockets by dropping 20 of them,

1388
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
and three of them ignited.

1389
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Three of them ignited.

1390
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And I heard some stories about them trying to test the warhead.

1391
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So they get a guy to shoot a rifle at the warhead,

1392
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and sometimes he misses and hits the rocket,

1393
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
and he shouts, the rocket takes off.

1394
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But they didn't have a box to put this in.

1395
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
So they get the number three out of 20.

1396
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So you get a probability three out of 20,

1397
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
three by 20.

1398
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And I said, I've seen that number before,

1399
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
because I go through all these calculations sheets.

1400
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And I come and I find that number,

1401
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
and they say, oh, that's the probability of a warhead going out,

1402
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
not a rocket, at least.

1403
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It gives a reference. I look up this reference.

1404
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And what happened is everybody started referencing everybody else,

1405
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
and what started out as a rocket ignition

1406
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
ended up as the warhead.

1407
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Going on.

1408
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And of course, if it's the rocket igniting,

1409
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
and there's 15 or 30 other rockets inside a steel container,

1410
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
you've got a bomb.

1411
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Because they can only hold like three rockets igniting.

1412
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
So we pointed out that to them,

1413
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
and so that was kind of interesting.

1414
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Because it illustrates that the science that gets done

1415
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
depends to a large extent on how the organization

1416
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
of it is structured and funded.

1417
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And if everybody says, gee, that's an interesting idea,

1418
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
but it's not my job.

1419
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
That means it's not being done.

1420
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Everybody has a good reason why they're not doing it.

1421
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But what happens is

1422
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:46,000
the organizational structure in a sense can direct us

1423
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
to ask certain questions and not do other questions.

1424
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And then when those questions come up occasionally,

1425
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
people can just dismiss it as not my job.

1426
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So we better change the organization.

1427
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
That's not my job. The organization is too big.

1428
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I can't change it.

1429
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
And so what happens is the problems continue.

1430
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Now, fortunately, they've managed to get rid of all of them.

1431
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
55 rockets. They did not transport them.

1432
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So we got the right decision.

1433
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
We brought that.

1434
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And how much of my response date?

1435
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
We wrote it up.

1436
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And how much of it survived through the bureaucratic process?

1437
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Some of it did. Some of it didn't.

1438
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
So I don't know.

1439
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But it was fascinating.

1440
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I learned a lot about risk analysis.

1441
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So that organizational structure.

1442
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So they're doing a good job.

1443
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I mean, they had to get incinerated because these rockets,

1444
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
they put a stabilizer in them.

1445
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
But if that stabilizer degrades and they think it does,

1446
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I mean, those rockets go off.

1447
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And they're all stored together.

1448
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
That's not good.

1449
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
They had literally millions of millions of emissions.

1450
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
So when you read in the paper of the Soviet Union

1451
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
and the United States arguing about who's, you know,

1452
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
have the weapons and so forth,

1453
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
what they should have been saying was,

1454
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
here, you take them.

1455
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
No, you take them.

1456
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
No, I don't want them.

1457
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
You take them.

1458
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I mean, they were billion-dollar problem.

1459
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Okay, potential disaster.

1460
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And, you know, that was interesting.

1461
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Yeah.

1462
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So what other bullet?

1463
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I want to ask about Sam and the idea of salmon parks.

1464
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Oh, yeah, salmon.

1465
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Well, I've worked a lot with fisheries biologists

1466
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
and largely because once I started studying these human systems,

1467
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I didn't get, I didn't get research grants.

1468
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So I don't have travel money.

1469
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So Sam is a local woman.

1470
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
We had some very fine people here in Sam.

1471
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
So the American Fisheries Society back in 2005.

1472
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
They published it in 2006, but somewhere before then.

1473
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:10,000
They basically said we've been trying to protect wild salmon

1474
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and we've spent billions of dollars

1475
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
and it's not working.

1476
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So we want to select 33 people from out the country

1477
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
and even maybe outside the country.

1478
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But mainly Canada and the United States and Northwest.

1479
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
What would you do?

1480
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So totally free to say what would you do?

1481
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Okay.

1482
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And so I was one of them.

1483
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Okay.

1484
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
So Bob Lackey, he's over there in political science and fisheries.

1485
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
He was the director and Denise Locke was on it.

1486
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So Bob, so they framed the problem.

1487
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
The problem is how do we have significant numbers of wild salmon

1488
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
by the year 2100.

1489
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And then he had four policy guides.

1490
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And one of them were four policy drivers.

1491
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Okay.

1492
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
That's something that I mean.

1493
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And one of them was

1494
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
people are going to have to change their preferences

1495
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
or their values or preferences.

1496
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So I went through the whole thing and I basically concluded that

1497
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
the way they framed the problem, you can't solve the problem.

1498
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Okay. We're not going to solve the problem.

1499
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
The problem numbers of wild salmon, that's not the real problem.

1500
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
The problem is what kind of world do we want to leave future generations?

1501
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And the whole business about preferences, I said no.

1502
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
We're going to get outcomes that no one prefers.

1503
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So what I did is I reframed the problem.

1504
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Now that's kind of like you're being given a test and you go in and you decide,

1505
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I can't answer this question so I'm going to change the question.

1506
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
You're not supposed to do that.

1507
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
But I did it and I got to give them credit.

1508
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
They kept the paper in there.

1509
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So basically what I had to do is I thought it would be real easy.

1510
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I'll just say wild salmon national park.

1511
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
That's what we need.

1512
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
But in order to do that, I had to challenge all the ways

1513
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
that we're thinking, which are linear ways of thinking.

1514
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
The international park is doable.

1515
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
We have all sorts of agencies doing all sorts of things,

1516
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
like the Corps of Engineers, its mitigation sites.

1517
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
We don't even know where they are.

1518
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,000
If you pull that money together and you could buy up

1519
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
particularly high flood prone areas, which are the best habitats,

1520
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
all the way throughout the whole northwest.

1521
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And you would have a distributed wild salmon national park.

1522
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Even through cities, people want their waterfronts.

1523
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So it wouldn't be total natural systems.

1524
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And there are a whole sorts of flood zones.

1525
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
You look at the land of river and you see all these different twists and turns.

1526
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
The farmers have trouble farming there because they flood.

1527
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
They plan all these weeds, but they call weeds, which are biologists,

1528
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
called the natural floor.

1529
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
It's really funny.

1530
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And if you look at the people who are studying floods,

1531
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
they map out high flood prone areas and we got to prevent development

1532
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
to something about that.

1533
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And then you go over to the wildlife biologist and take their maps

1534
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
of ideal habitat and they almost overlap.

1535
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So it's a no-brainer.

1536
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Why don't we just buy some of this land?

1537
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And pay the people not to build there rather than putting concrete

1538
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,000
or rock root wrap along the banks because it may erode.

1539
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So I went through a whole bunch of those things.

1540
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And I basically found that we could have a wild salmon national park.

1541
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And it would run right through different parts

1542
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
of the whole Pacific Northwest.

1543
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And try and let the salmon come back.

1544
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And let the salmon guys.

1545
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
The biggest resistance seemed to come from the science.

1546
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And it wasn't about the science.

1547
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Everybody agreed we have to protect habitat.

1548
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
But they would say nobody's going to support it.

1549
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
People don't prefer that.

1550
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Well, I took that and said, how do you know?

1551
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
First, it's not about preferences.

1552
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
The amount of money is pittance.

1553
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I took the whole national park budget for that year.

1554
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So I don't know.

1555
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I may get the numbers wrong, but five billion, let's just say.

1556
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And then I compared the bonuses given to Goldman Sachs.

1557
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
One bank is like 20 billion.

1558
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Here's the national park, the whole national park.

1559
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Here's the bonuses given to Goldman Sachs.

1560
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
The year before the whole system crashed.

1561
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I don't think the people even in Goldman Sachs think that that makes sense.

1562
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
But you say, oh, people want.

1563
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And then the same year that we finally published this,

1564
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:03,000
maybe it's the special national park's America's best idea.

1565
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
So basically, I conclude that the reason we don't have that

1566
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
is because the institutions have framed the problem in pieces.

1567
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So everybody can say, it's not my job.

1568
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And then everybody can blame everybody else.

1569
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And then everybody can focus on their little job.

1570
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Now, there is a guy who could be interesting to interview.

1571
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I don't know the David Lane.

1572
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Because he did his PhD dissertation on reframing.

1573
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And he used the same in 2100 as his test case.

1574
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And he's got brilliant idea.

1575
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
He basically said, if there are environmental problems

1576
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
that we have not been able to solve,

1577
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
we've probably framed the problem in the wrong way.

1578
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It's like if I give an exam question to my engineering students,

1579
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
and at the end of the exam period,

1580
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
all my smart students are still trying to solve the problem.

1581
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I'm in trouble because I framed the problem in a way they can't solve.

1582
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So what he wanted to do was to look back over the history and find reframings

1583
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
because we will lose them because the institutions framed the problem

1584
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
in a particular way.

1585
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So if someone comes along and reframes it,

1586
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
everybody may say it's a good idea,

1587
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
but it gets lost in the institution.

1588
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
So he developed software to get indicators of reframing.

1589
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And he could have a software search through with these indicators

1590
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
to try to find a radical reframed and identify it.

1591
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And he used same in 2100 as an example.

1592
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And his indicators go like this.

1593
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And then my paper came out like this.

1594
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
So that's how I got to know him.

1595
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:56,000
So he's working over there with international students with English teaching English.

1596
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I'm going to ask you a couple more questions about OSU.

1597
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Your research interests in your context, primary context,

1598
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
it seems we're pretty far afield from traditional civil engineering.

1599
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Did you ever feel isolated or like a man about a home on some level?

1600
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Yeah, you do sometimes.

1601
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:21,000
The hardest thing over the years,

1602
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
people act like, well, if you do this, you know,

1603
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
somebody's going to fire you then, that's not the problem.

1604
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I never had the problem.

1605
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:36,000
No, I was fortunate because, maybe because of my family,

1606
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
but I could teach.

1607
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
So I get real high course evaluations.

1608
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
So that sort of protected me.

1609
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And because if you're not bringing in research dollars,

1610
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
it's going to be pretty hard to survive.

1611
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
But I was able to do that.

1612
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
So there's some interesting stories on that.

1613
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Well, I'll tell you one story.

1614
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Some of the Columbia roots study, history study.

1615
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And Guy Daniel Hancock and I were subcontractors for that.

1616
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I said, this is a dangerous project.

1617
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I only want to be a subcontractor for the interactions,

1618
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
the biophysical interactions.

1619
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
How does all this stuff interact?

1620
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And so we're looking at the project and they made all these grants

1621
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
and they're out there.

1622
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And none of it's going to interact because people are doing their own thing.

1623
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,000
So we come up with a scheme where we develop hypothesis systems.

1624
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I said, well, we'll have an annual meeting.

1625
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And Dan and I put up these hypothesis systems about a problem.

1626
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And we'll present it to the whole group.

1627
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And I said, we'll follow the Bella cooking rule.

1628
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Anybody who doesn't like it gets to do it the next time.

1629
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Anybody who can play.

1630
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So you end up with these, everybody interacts with me,

1631
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
end up with these hypothesis systems.

1632
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And then you reallocate the funding based upon whether you're going to

1633
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
actually be able to address these hypotheses.

1634
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
So it's a learning process.

1635
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
So there's a story that's going to be a workshop there.

1636
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And so the manager of the project,

1637
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
he says, okay, you will meet for the first half of the day

1638
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and I'll do the second half of the day or vice versa.

1639
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You'll do half of the day.

1640
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
So we said, okay, so we prepared this for the citizens advisory group

1641
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
and there are people in there who are fishermen and local people there.

1642
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I mean, they know a lot about the history.

1643
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
They know a lot more than I do about it.

1644
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So we present this to them.

1645
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Oh, when we get down there, the manager says,

1646
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
you do the whole day, I'm not going to do anything.

1647
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So I think he was thinking he was going to drop something on us.

1648
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
But actually, he said great.

1649
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
So we do the workshop and they loved it because these fishermen had,

1650
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I mean, they had ideas on this and we're sketching them out

1651
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
and they said, now we can be involved in this and we can actually,

1652
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
you can come to these meetings.

1653
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So the meeting ends and we go out to eat and the managers there.

1654
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And I didn't realize, we didn't pick up on his,

1655
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
we're usually pretty good at picking up on body language.

1656
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
But Dan and I are still talking.

1657
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
We don't realize how angry he is because this means our approach,

1658
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
he has to reorganize the boxes and he's got them all lined up.

1659
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And I didn't realize how angry he was until we're eating

1660
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and all of a sudden he loses it, jumps up and throws his briefcase out.

1661
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Which I catch and throw it back at him and he storms out,

1662
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:18,000
well, needless to say, we didn't get funded, but the whole project crashed.

1663
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But the interesting part is apparently, if I remember right,

1664
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,000
my promotion committee was meeting like the week before.

1665
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So on the record, I had this grant.

1666
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,000
So I was able to squeak by, yes, I don't know, but I made it.

1667
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
But now you were getting by a lost track of the question,

1668
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
how do I feel at Oregon State?

1669
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,000
The hardest thing to deal with are the stone faces.

1670
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
You bring up an interesting idea, something that you think is important

1671
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
and you get a plank, plank.

1672
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And I noticed this when David Lane would go with me as you got the stone face.

1673
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
And I think what happens is, I'm not sure what's really going on here,

1674
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,000
but people become so focused on their little field

1675
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
that the grooves in their brain get so deep that it just doesn't register.

1676
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Or they may say, oh, you'll just have to read our literature.

1677
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
It's just not there.

1678
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
So it's been sort of a lack of exciting discourse.

1679
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I think that's probably been the hardest thing to deal with.

1680
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And that takes a toll.

1681
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
There is a story on this.

1682
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
David and Goliath.

1683
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
David and Big Goliath, a huge guy.

1684
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
No one wants to take him on, so David, the shepherd boy,

1685
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
comes up and says, I'll take him on.

1686
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,000
The first thing he puts on the King's armor, he can't move.

1687
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
We put on a lot of armor, we can't move either.

1688
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Academic citations and references in the academic language

1689
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
and mathematical equations, he can't move.

1690
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:28,000
So he takes off the armor, goes there, picks up and gets some stones.

1691
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And of course, the story goes, it's nice Goliath.

1692
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I said, yeah, but what about the other stones?

1693
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Let me tell you that.

1694
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
See, they lead parts for years, supposed to fill in.

1695
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So I'll tell you what happened to the other stones.

1696
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
This is the first stone.

1697
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
He missed.

1698
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That's what life is about.

1699
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You miss.

1700
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,000
So then, okay, second stone.

1701
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
This is well.

1702
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
He hit him.

1703
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
He hit him really mad.

1704
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Okay.

1705
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Third stone.

1706
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So this is the one that's most painful.

1707
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,000
What's worse than hitting him and getting really mad?

1708
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Get it?

1709
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Make a shot.

1710
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Hit him right between the eyes.

1711
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
He doesn't even notice.

1712
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That really wears on for a long time.

1713
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
So I'm at the end of my talk, you know.

1714
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Someone said, someone who knew the story better.

1715
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
There's another stone.

1716
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
What?

1717
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Yeah, there's a fourth one.

1718
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
What did that one do?

1719
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I said, I don't know.

1720
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I don't know.

1721
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So my wife is there.

1722
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And I just leave.

1723
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I come home.

1724
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
She goes back and she says, I know what the fourth stone was.

1725
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
It's the Holy Rolling Stone.

1726
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Like a what?

1727
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
She put on this music.

1728
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And it was from a TV show.

1729
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Joan of Arcadia or something.

1730
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
The word God appears to people.

1731
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Is the janitor or somebody like this.

1732
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And it's like a Holy Rolling Stone.

1733
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And so I still don't get it.

1734
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
He says, he dropped it.

1735
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And it became the Holy Rolling Stone for someone else to pick up.

1736
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And that's, whoa, that's cool.

1737
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So, but anyhow, the painful part is often this.

1738
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Being seen that there are some really big challenging problems.

1739
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And then just not being able to sustain the discourse.

1740
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
That's the hardest part.

1741
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Well, you've seen a lot of change at OSU.

1742
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And this is a season of change for the university as well.

1743
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I'm warning you to be interested in your perspective on kind of where the university has come from, where it's heading.

1744
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Yeah.

1745
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Well, they've done a very good job in the campus and landscaping.

1746
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I think the campus and the landscaping is really remarkable.

1747
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I think they've pretty much given up on the idea of educating an alert and knowledgeable citizenry.

1748
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
You have to have discourse in order to do this.

1749
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I think they're really very close ties with the industry.

1750
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I think Rod Adams, who was the dean of engineering, very close ties in the industry, he's now, I guess, a vice president or something now.

1751
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And it's not that that's bad, but it's sort of like it's unbalanced.

1752
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And there has to be some other role where the university does some unique things that no one else can do.

1753
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
And I think they've forgotten that.

1754
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
And I think they're good people.

1755
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:22,000
They raise good person, Steve Clark's good person.

1756
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But what I find in the systems is the systems of DAPS,

1757
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:35,000
so the people who are very successful in them in a sense become part of the system far more than they realize.

1758
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
They become not just in the system, but out of the system.

1759
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And it's just too easy to start believing your own hype.

1760
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And that's sort of a danger.

1761
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
And you need scouts.

1762
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:57,000
You need somebody, I used to tell a presence.

1763
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Custer's biggest mistake, it's a little big horn, as he didn't listen to his scouts.

1764
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
And the scouts, somebody who's not bucking for higher position.

1765
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And the only time you really need a scout is to tell you something you don't want to hear.

1766
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
That you're going in the wrong direction.

1767
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
You don't need someone applauding the direction you're going in.

1768
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:24,000
And so I think there's an absence of scouts that are out there that are willing to do that.

1769
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And I consider myself a scout.

1770
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I'm not a leader in the sense I don't have lots of people following me, and I'm not a follower.

1771
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I go out and explore.

1772
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And that's important.

1773
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So we are testing with, I'm always trying something, but with one idea.

1774
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:56,000
And I'm working with Charlie Vars, former mayor and economist and court smith and anthropologist.

1775
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And it has to do with global warming.

1776
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:10,000
And we have many, many, probably thousands over here as students from places, particularly China, coming here.

1777
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Very conscientious when going back. That's a good one.

1778
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
So the question is, where are they really learning when they come here?

1779
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I mean, this place blows their mind.

1780
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
This is totally different.

1781
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And first of all, they're wealthy.

1782
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:39,000
So it's not the peasants coming from China that I grew up with.

1783
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I mean, buy some pretty nice cars.

1784
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And they're living in a place that in any place else in the world would be called car heaven.

1785
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I mean, we talk about our parking problems.

1786
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I mean, compared to the rest of the world, this is nothing.

1787
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So they're learning something like being here.

1788
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And I think they're learning the wrong lessons.

1789
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Okay, they're learning.

1790
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
This is how things are done.

1791
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
And if they're in civil engineering, they're probably being taught how to do it.

1792
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So we came up with a proposal.

1793
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And basically that Oregon State University and the city of Gervales in the canary

1794
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
would develop some of no-car communities served by rail line.

1795
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
We have an existing rail line.

1796
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
That existing rail line goes north, goes right through the middle of town,

1797
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
goes through the southern end of the campus, and right through a piece of property bigger than the campus.

1798
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
The university owns most of it.

1799
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And then further.

1800
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You build a clustered no-car community.

1801
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I don't know the scale.

1802
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You want to get a scale that is viable neighborhood scale,

1803
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:02,000
so that if you were building a mega city that would be the sort of scale in the neighborhood.

1804
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So I don't know, 1,500 to 3,000 something.

1805
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:13,000
And what you do is you involve the students in the design of this.

1806
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And in doing it, we are telling them the way we have developed this has been a mistake.

1807
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Okay, this cannot continue.

1808
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And we are going to do it for ourselves.

1809
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
We're not lecturing you that you are to do something that we've done.

1810
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
You know, that you shouldn't do what we've done.

1811
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:41,000
What we're doing is we're asking for your help to help design a viable community here in Carvallis

1812
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
that would involve students, involve faculty, and some citizens from town.

1813
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
The rail line is all the way through there.

1814
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's already there.

1815
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
How could we use it?

1816
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
What could be the way to do it?

1817
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And what we would do is involve the students in lessons learned.

1818
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
They go look to all of the world.

1819
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
What were the successes and failures?

1820
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
There's a couple of cities in China that.

1821
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
One city that is pretty much a walkable city.

1822
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
But there's also some disasters in China.

1823
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So you learn from those.

1824
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Okay, lessons learned.

1825
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And then you get some of them to start building a virtual examples of this.

1826
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
They can take tours.

1827
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
There is a program where it's a construction program.

1828
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I don't know whether you're familiar.

1829
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I'm not in the video gaming.

1830
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
But Atlantic had a magazine.

1831
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
And of course, it's an imaginary world.

1832
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
You know, with monsters and all the rest of it.

1833
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
But they build stuff.

1834
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Why not make a real one?

1835
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
They have 100 million participants in this thing.

1836
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,000
That's more than all the university students in the United States.

1837
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Okay?

1838
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
So what you would do is you make this part of their effort.

1839
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And what they would do is say you want to understand the local culture.

1840
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
This is the university town.

1841
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
We have a campus.

1842
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
There's some good examples.

1843
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
How can you build on the architectural success on the campus?

1844
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So that when they went back, they'd say,

1845
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
what's the local culture?

1846
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
How do we build on the success of that local culture?

1847
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
How do we do this?

1848
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
No, we don't need to have automobiles.

1849
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
And you can serve it in different ways and have viable communities.

1850
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
So anyhow, we've written up a proposal.

1851
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It's one page, both sides.

1852
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
And then we've written a memo which we gave to Steve Clark.

1853
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Okay?

1854
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And I got with everything.

1855
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Went anywhere.

1856
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
But we're going to start spreading it out.

1857
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And we've been meeting on this for about a year now every week over the magic.

1858
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So we're just going to go, I don't know.

1859
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
But you know, it's doable.

1860
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
When you look at the satellite photographs,

1861
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
if they take Google or whatever,

1862
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
it's Earth, Google Earth.

1863
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
You look around and you can see this.

1864
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
It goes right by a parking garage.

1865
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I mean, how ironic.

1866
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Right by a parking garage.

1867
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And then right on through this piece of land,

1868
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
you can have open space, farm space, all around it.

1869
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And then there's another one just near,

1870
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
you look back at it.

1871
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
And then you look at the sight of you, the back of it is, you know,

1872
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
it's about a half-barging space.

1873
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
It's mostly empty now.

1874
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Anyhow, that's some of the stuff we're working on.

1875
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Well, my last question for you is as you think about the future,

1876
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
are you able to stay optimistic?

1877
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Okay, this is a good question.

1878
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
There's a big difference between optimism and hope.

1879
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Okay?

1880
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
And there's a Cornell West,

1881
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
he's a Theologian from the Hill,

1882
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
and he's black.

1883
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
And he says,

1884
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I cannot be optimistic but I am eternally hopeful.

1885
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Hope requires courage to act when doubt is warranted.

1886
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Okay?

1887
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Now David Lane found that when he did his thesis.

1888
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
And when I was in a class,

1889
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
his honest class, David Lane presented that to that class.

1890
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Their jaws dropped.

1891
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
And they said, why hasn't anybody told us that?

1892
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
So optimism,

1893
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:33,000
it's hard for me to be optimistic.

1894
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
But optimism involves what the Buddha's call attachment.

1895
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
You're attaching to the outcome.

1896
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
So you don't want to attach to the outcome.

1897
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And I realize an engineer, you know,

1898
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
he's supposed to attach to the outcome.

1899
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
But an engineer can deal with big problems

1900
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
and deal with a lot of little ones.

1901
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
The little ones don't add up.

1902
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
The little ones may be good,

1903
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
but they don't, that doesn't mean that the whole is good.

1904
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Okay?

1905
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
The world with linear, that would make sense.

1906
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
For the world with linear, I can be a great musician,

1907
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
because I can play great notes on a grand piano.

1908
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
But when I add up all the notes, it's terrible music.

1909
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
So the world is non-linear.

1910
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm hopeful.

1911
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
And I'm hopeful.

1912
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And what you do is you don't attach to the outcomes

1913
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
and you do something creative.

1914
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
You try to make a contribution in there.

1915
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
And you don't.

1916
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Of course sometimes it feels bad if it doesn't work.

1917
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
But I look back.

1918
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
And if I look at all the failures,

1919
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
if you wanted to say they didn't go anywhere,

1920
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
now someone did.

1921
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
And if I had to do it over again, I'd do it the same way.

1922
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
So there's no regret.

1923
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
So I guess if you approach, you know, I'm 75 now.

1924
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
You approach that age, and you don't have regrets.

1925
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And you say, no, I wouldn't trade what I've done with anybody else I know.

1926
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
That's pretty good.

1927
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:13,000
But if I ask me, OK, well, why don't you list all your accomplishments?

1928
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
No, I know.

1929
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I think that's the right question.

1930
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Now, again, that gets to be some theological that,

1931
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:30,000
in Cornell West, hope is a courage to act when doubt is warranted.

1932
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And then hope also comes as a gift,

1933
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
freely gift.

1934
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
That's what they call grace.

1935
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
So I don't know.

1936
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I was going to turn out.

1937
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
But I don't have to know.

1938
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
And the idea of prediction and control is just an illusion.

1939
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
It's just, yeah.

1940
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Yeah, if you're building a cabin, maybe that's OK.

1941
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But we're talking about the future of the Earth and societies.

1942
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
It's just something.

1943
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
So we need to tell that to the students.

1944
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Our generation used to tell that to them.

1945
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Well, thank you very much.

1946
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Thank you very much.

1947
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
This has been a lot of fun, and I appreciate you being so generous with your time

1948
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
and welcoming your home.

1949
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Well, I would again, anybody who looks at this,

1950
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
that the oral history is extremely important,

1951
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
because there are a lot of things that didn't make it

1952
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
into all the documents that they're studying.

1953
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And they may be the important things.

1954
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
It's kind of what Sherlock Holmes, a dog that didn't bark.

1955
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
OK, the stuff that you don't find.

1956
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Why didn't you find it?

1957
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Well, that can even learn a lot from that.

1958
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Yeah, learn a lot from that.

1959
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Yeah, we'll do what we can.

1960
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
OK, well, good.

1961
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I appreciate it.

1962
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Thanks.

1963
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Thank you.
