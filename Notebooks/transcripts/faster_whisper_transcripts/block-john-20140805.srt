1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Dr. Bock, if you could please introduce yourself with your name in today's state in our location.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My name is John Block, today's date is August 5th, 2014, and we are in the family room of my house.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And we're going to talk a bit about your career and pharmacy and your association with OSU.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We want to start off at the beginning. You were born in Yakima, Washington.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That is correct. Is that where you were raised?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, all the way through high school and then Washington State University for bachelor's degrees and master's and university Wisconsin and Madison for my doctorate.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What were your parents backgrounds?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You mean business-wise, education-wise, what does it give us a sense of view?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, my mother was born and raised in Yakima. It's a funny story. Her parents were in probably the last group of pioneers.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They're actually listed in the Yakima Valley Historical Museum on some wall plaque.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They actually came out in a pioneer train. They were on a wagon train.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She was raised there and born on a farm. I think my granddad was a foreman or something like that. It was not his farm.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And the interesting thing was her birth was never registered because she was a girl baby born out on a farm.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I was not pertinent later on after she was married to my dad who I mentioned just a moment. They got a court order.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But hers was a court order birth certificate which then paid off when Medicare came along because she could prove her age.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My dad was raised in Buffalo, New York.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And in those days, there was no State University in New York per se.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They were the State of New York supported different majors at private schools. So I think forestry was at Syracuse, engineering was at Cornell, things like that.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And he was a twin. And second born, he had an older brother and his dad being German.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Said the oldest son was the one who's going to get to go to college. So my dad took commercial courses.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And in the senior year in high school, his dad, my granddad, told him whether there was enough money for him to go to college.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, my dad sort of said he didn't take the college trip courses so he was not eligible for any New York school.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So he went to the University of Pennsylvania, graduated from the Wharton School of Business Administration.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As my dad said before Harvard stole the faculty, hired onto the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And Harvey Firestone with Junior was in his training class.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then as he looked for a position to be a Firestone Tire salesman, he found that the Eastern Washington, or actually the Central Washington District, had done very poorly.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And he had been advised, don't replace every tiring salesman who was real successful because you'll go down, go to one that is not successful as you can go up.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And he was, he was successful. And he, Basie, I think was headquarter in Yakima, but his territory taken all through the Eastern Washington.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And they small wheat towns, colitis, wash, techno. I guess over the coal facts, maybe up to Spokane that I'm not sure.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My mother, I guess they were going to a baseball game somewhere and got married.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Drove a Model A Ford for their Wharton trip back to Buffalo, which is where he was then going to work. He resigned from Firestone.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And as they've gone, I guess into Canada crossing Detroit, Windsor, then into Canada, then across the Peace Bridge, into Buffalo.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And the immigration customs guy on the U.S. side, of course, asked who they were, where they were born.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And my dad said he was born in Buffalo fine. My mother was very naive and said she was born in Yakima.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He asked her what part of Japan was that. And she didn't have a birth certificate as I indicated.

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well then, so he got in, obviously. Depression struck.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And what people didn't realize was that depression was roughest in the industrial parts of the United States,

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
because the manufacturing stopped, the people were all laid off.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And the rural areas, things weren't great, but people ate and they bartered.

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So my dad decided we're going to head back out to the state of Washington.

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And he had business contacts who could help him get established.

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And so that's how he got back west, left Buffalo, and got going in Yakima on.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Basically, Billupman and a fuel oil gasoline distribution business.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Fuel oil before natural gas had come in.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you have any siblings?

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I had my brother died a couple of years ago. He was eight years older than me.

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I said he died a couple of years ago.

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He graduated from Washington State also, ROTC, back in the days of the Korean War.

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And of course, remember there was a draft on.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And stayed in the military.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Got to be a bird kernel.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And so actually I attended and participated in his internment in Arlington with the full case on,

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
banned the whole ceremony.

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What were you just screwing up as a boy in Yakima?

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, that's interesting.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I guess I dabbled around in photography.

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I had a dark room.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
With shoot pictures.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I had a 30-fold Argus C-335 millimeter camera.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I graduated from a Brownie, Kodak Brownie.

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And with development pictures, I never did do color.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I did family photo Christmas cards.

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Took some of the pictures around the church I grew up in.

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And got on the, I was, got on the stage crew at Yakima.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Those days was Yakima Senior High School.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was the only high school in town in those days.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it was also the city auditorium.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It had a beautiful, a nice auditorium, full stage,

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
dressing rooms in the basement.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And we would be, those are the stage crew.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If we worked for a somebody putting a show on, we would get paid.

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I got finally a response position.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I even got a key to the stage area.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And learned how to get along with the janitors.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I was on the stage crew when the Air Force band came through.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And there was a stage circus with a little baby elephant in the basement.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That upset the janitor because he made a mess.

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And of course, there were the plays and things like that that were put on.

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How much of your early interest in science or in pharmacy?

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I guess it was just the science courses that we had to take curriculum in those days

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
when I was pretty regimented in high school.

82
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And well, even I come out of the era of junior high.

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So grade school went through sixth grade.

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Junior high was seventh through ninth.

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And high school was tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And had very good science teachers.

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They all had a master's degree.

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's pretty much in their science and their subject matter,

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
as opposed to a master's of teaching.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I guess that was how I got my interest.

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't pick pharmacy right away.

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I went as an undeclared major at Washington state and hunted around

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and went to the counseling center.

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And sort of looked bad.

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I thought, well, you kind of had the pre-farmacy curriculum

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
as what I was doing.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And it was one where I didn't think I'd be stuck in a lab.

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I would know the public well, I ended up in a lab anyway,

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
off to grad school and academia.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, tell me about your experience at Washington state

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
as an undergrad in the budding pharmacist.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, we lived in...

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There were two political parties in those days.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There were the Greeks and the independence.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And there was none of this that freshman lived in the dorms

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
their first year.

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you pledge, you went to your Greek house immediately.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The person who was in charge of the dorms believed in a strong dorm system

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and loyalty and so forth.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So if you went in Greek by golly, you went to your fraternity or sorority for the women.

111
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And of course, there was no such thing as co-ed dorms.

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The boys were on one side of the campus

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and the girls on the other side of the campus.

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And if you didn't get the girl in on certain times,

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you got a campus and you had to give her a dozen roses,

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
which happened to me once.

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And the dorm I was in was nice.

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They were sweets of rooms.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They had washbasins in the rooms.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There weren't the long hallways.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It was...

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I won't call it semi-private, but they were nice.

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And they were quiet.

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They had real thick walls between the rooms.

125
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So plaster on a lathe.

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So it was good.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And we had a good reputation.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We got one of the higher grade point averages.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There was this type of competition and intermural,

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
which I didn't participate in.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
My worst sport in school was PE.

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Just as an aside, you'll never guess who my high school...

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
One of my two high school physical education instructors

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
were Bobo Brayton before he went off to Washington State

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
to be the famous baseball coach.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He was a high school PE teacher.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What was the curriculum like for you in pharmacy as an undergrad?

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I have seen it was somewhat different from what students do.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It was...

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, we had compounding.

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It had a lot more lab involved.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And so I said,

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we'd compounded ointments and creams and suspensions

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and elixirs and all that type of stuff.

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Otherwise, medicinal chemistry was medicinal chemistry

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
based on what was known those days.

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Pharmacology was pharmacology.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Pharmacidics was pharmaceuticals.

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It just...

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There wasn't as much known.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The concept of a receptor was just that,

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
a receptor.

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It had never been one,

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it had never been isolated.

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Drug design was in its infancy.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was basically a group of compounds

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and the companies would screen them.

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And if they got a hit, they got a hit.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The key fobver amendments had not yet passed.

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So you had to tell it a might situation occurred.

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm trying to remember when the efficacy requirements went in

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and they screened all the over-the-counter drugs

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and reform laid a lot of them because the brands were popular

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but they had to take ingredients out

165
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
because they couldn't prove they were effective.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So I would say the science and the efficacy requirements

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
have greatly increased over the years.

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And now, there of course into all the re-evaluate

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and the type of statistics that are used

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and how much are the companies.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I don't mean as an anti-company thing at all

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
because I'm sure some of the same stuff went on the lab

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and the university labs too.

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll just look at the number of papers that are being retracted

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
nowadays coming out at university labs

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and institutes and so forth.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But when you throw out a bad study,

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
when we were out at the bad study,

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it was probably a very important study that said something

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you better be alert to.

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I would say there's a lot more in the stay-in-age

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
of electronic and communication and so forth.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Anyways, the public may be better protected.

184
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The time that you'd finished the Washington State,

185
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
it was pretty clear you were going to be a farmer

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
since it seems.

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What about it, appeal to you?

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What was your, sparked your interest, I suppose,

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in pursuing career in pharmacy?

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, I knew I could not do medicine

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
because you'll notice I'm holding my hands here

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and there's a slight tremor.

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have what's called familial or idiopathic tremor

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and hair different grandmother through mother through me.

195
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And at least in medical school in those days,

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
there was a required surgical rotation.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And you would not want me to be your surgeon.

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And in fact, in physiology,

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
we had to do surgeries on rabbits

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and we all had to take turns.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And I didn't do too well in my rabbit.

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Unfortunately, I had three other people on the team

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
that could bail me out.

204
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I was one of those kids in grade school

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
when testing the measurement came along first grade.

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I couldn't get my bow tied on my shoe.

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm real clueless with my hands.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So you didn't want me in medicine at all

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
or dentistry or anything like that.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But I can count or lick and stick.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I mean, which is, of course,

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and convey knowledge to the customer or the client.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But the follow-up later became Dean at Washington State

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
looked at my record and said,

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
basically, I think you ought to consider graduate school.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So that's just a faculty member took an interest.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So you had to put me off in that direction.

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You had to mentor a source of that.

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, definitely.

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Definitely.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well, you went to Wisconsin briefly after Washington State.

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, I was there for four years.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Right.

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But did you do some post-grad work at Wisconsin

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
right after you finished your bachelor's degree?

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Am I right about that?

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
After my bachelor's degree,

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and I stayed at Washington State to get my master's.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then went to Wisconsin.

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I was there for four years in a difficult period of time

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to get a doctorate,

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
at least in the chemical-like pharmacy sciences, came here.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So I graduated in, basically, 1966.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Tell me about your graduate training.

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Washington State was in Wisconsin.

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Washington State was a traditional,

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I mean, for the masters was a traditional medicinal chemistry

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
had a research problem,

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
make a series of compounds.

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I wasn't there for them to be tested.

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But that was basically it.

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And, of course, you take the appropriate chemistry courses

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
with, in fact, most of the courses were in chemistry,

244
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
except for an advanced course in drug design.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
At Wisconsin,

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
did you want me to jump to Wisconsin?

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, one of you ready?

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay.

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
At Wisconsin, again, they didn't have a course.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It was interesting.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was really going to work for a different chemist.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And he moved on to Kansas.

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I say, I ended up at Wisconsin.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And that's an interesting story.

255
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay.

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
God will be able to have a lot of inches on your,

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I guess it's no longer inches on the table.

258
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's a silicate chip.

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And there it is.

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Right.

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I applied to three different graduate school,

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
or I wrote to three different graduate schools

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and applied to two, if I remember right.

264
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I told you the person I was interested in at Wisconsin

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
had moved to Kansas University of Kansas at Lawrence.

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But they sent me old outdated catalogs.

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So I just shrugged it off.

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I had, there were a couple new faculty members

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
at Washington State who were both Wisconsin grads.

270
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I was sort of getting input from them at the same time.

271
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And they knew the personalities of Wisconsin.

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I applied to the University of California at San Francisco,

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
which is where the pharmacy, that's the medical center

274
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
of the University of California.

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The original medical center for the University of California

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
is system there more than one now.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And applied there and was accepted with a teaching assistantship.

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I got accepted at the University of Wisconsin

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
with a research assistantship.

280
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And they, these two fellow faculty assistant presses

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
has grabbed the research assistantship

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and you can start right out near research

283
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and speed things along.

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So I did.

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And it was very interesting.

286
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
In late spring, I got a letter from the University of California,

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
San Francisco.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
San, they would award me a Smith Klein and French fellowship.

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think probably I was a runner-up

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and whoever they originally gave it to turned it down

291
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and went somewhere else.

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But by that time I had made my choice

293
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and it didn't seem right to back down.

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Very few when I'd accepted.

295
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And it would have actually been unethical for California

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to accept it me then.

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think they would have cared.

298
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But it turned out well.

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I got my doctorate.

300
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I met my wife this December.

301
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It would be our 50th wedding anniversary.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So it worked out well at Wisconsin.

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Tell me about the environment there.

304
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How it was different from what Washington State?

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh.

306
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Wisconsin was definitely a research university.

307
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It was definitely publisher parish for the faculty.

308
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The undergrad, as the former dean told me on my exit interview,

309
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
he said, you want to understand the role of the undergraduate.

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They provide the tuition and support

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
so that you faculty can do your research.

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So treat them nicely.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, that was, I know there are fans and butts about it.

314
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You've got to keep in mind Wisconsin had a longer tradition

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that a lot of the big 10 schools,

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
because they had to Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So when you drink your glass of milk with vitamin D in it,

318
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the royalties from that patent that's gone to the University of Wisconsin.

319
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And if you are using warframe as an antiquite on her rat poison,

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the warface Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that was all discovered at Wisconsin.

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And on it goes.

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So they were in the business full-time,

324
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
a known mistake about it.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And a lot of us sort of had a reaction too,

326
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
like do we want to be a system of professors in this type of environment?

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So when the opportunity came to come to Oregon State,

328
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
it seemed nice attractive because there was more emphasis on the teaching.

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, before we get to see how I'm interested a little bit more

330
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
in your research as a graduate student, how I progressed.

331
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Well, it went well.

332
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I got publications.

333
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was a different type of problem.

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It was not a drug design problem.

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
My major professor was actually in the natural products.

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And he was very successful at it.

337
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But he had a, what was called a physical organic problem.

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He made his claim to fame by, actually, I think finding an error

339
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and a structure that the late RB Woodward developed that was just,

340
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
the only error was in the stereo chemistry.

341
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But anyway.

342
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So he wanted to follow up on that.

343
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And so basically that was my problem.

344
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I did not have to do natural products isolate

345
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and hope I got everything done with the 10 milligrams

346
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that could get out of the plant.

347
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I could just keep making my comp, my simple little compound

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and keep running tests on him so forth.

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So it was that type of problem.

350
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But otherwise it was a standard graduate,

351
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
university graduate, chemistry lab.

352
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Lab benches.

353
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Everybody in there working postdocs and graduate students.

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We came to OSU in 1966.

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's only a bit about the decision to move back to Oregon.

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It was mainly jobs were kind of tight academic jobs.

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I had a chance to interview at the chemical abstract service

358
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
at the American Chemical Society as the parent of it in Columbus, Ohio.

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I could tell that was all going to get computerized at some point.

360
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I thought that would be a good mix.

361
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I think I would have done well.

362
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But this other position came along.

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And I talked to a major professor and decided to take it.

364
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So it turned out that there was an opening also at the University of Nebraska,

365
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
which I guess I really wasn't that aware of.

366
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But a person I later knew and he and I became co-authors

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
on the first textbook I was involved with.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And he said, oh yeah, he knew about the, I don't know what you'll read, God is PhD.

369
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But he knew about the Oregon position.

370
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And later heard it was got filled.

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He didn't realize it was me until later we met with comparing notes.

372
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And I'm glad it took Oregon because things have not gone well for pharmacy in Nebraska.

373
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They were in Lincoln.

374
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And then they got moved to the medical center in Omaha.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And the provost of Moody was all very pro.

376
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Then Nebraska start half financial problems.

377
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There were two pharmacy schools in Omaha.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And the governor said, you know, I need one.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And why don't we let Creighton be it?

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know what he was still against having one of the state school.

381
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But anyway, so they had budgets cut.

382
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They had a school, but when budgets cuts like that happen

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and good faculty aren't going to go there and some leave,

384
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that would not have been a good situation.

385
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This has been a growth situation.

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And the pharmacy school here has grown professionally.

387
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And enrollment too, but professionally.

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What were your initial impressions of the university of Corralis?

389
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, Corralis was a nice beautiful college town even.

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I shouldn't say even in those days.

391
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I like the fact I could even bicycle.

392
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I had a bicycle from Wisconsin.

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The interview was weird.

394
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I have to say because my colleagues at Madison were going for their various interviews

395
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and talking about these research presentations they had to give and all this.

396
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And I come out here and there was no affirmative action.

397
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
None of that type of stuff.

398
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I was hiring the backseat of the Dean's car.

399
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
At the townhouse, Motel.

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
After 24 hours of interview.

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So anyway, things were...

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I thought, well, this is good. I like this.

403
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So I had a job.

404
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And my wife fortune's very flexible.

405
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And she had gone to school out of state and so forth as far as her bachelor's and traveled quite a bit.

406
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So she was fine.

407
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And she's enjoyed this town too very, very much so.

408
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Climate wise, it's superior to the winners of Wisconsin.

409
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then you have the hot muggy summers with the mosquitoes and Wisconsin.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So, no, this is a very pleasant place to live.

411
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
How would you characterize the department upon your arrival?

412
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Very heavy teach and orientate oriented and very, very structured.

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It was a small faculty. It was...

414
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No data, I believe it was a school of pharmacy.

415
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And then I think under President Wicker...

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It got to be Oregon State University.

417
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It was not Oregon State College.

418
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
A time I got here was Oregon State University.

419
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And some of the academic units were colleges and some were still schools.

420
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And he finally said, look, I guess he told the deans, I guess.

421
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I wasn't.

422
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That if you want to be a college, you can be a college.

423
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So I guess we changed our glider head.

424
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We became a college.

425
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And that meant we had departments.

426
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And the...

427
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But the word that, I mean, medicinal chemistry,

428
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
had a department head and two faculty.

429
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Pharmacidics had a department head and three faculty.

430
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Pharmacology had a department head and two faculty.

431
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It was crazy.

432
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I think there was a department of pharmacology,

433
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
which is the old term for natural products.

434
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I think they had two faculty.

435
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And so the deans didn't have faculty meetings.

436
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
This was Charlie Wilson.

437
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He had department head meetings.

438
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And so these four sort of senior guys sort of ran the school

439
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and the rest of it sort of picked up by osmosis.

440
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
What the heck was going on.

441
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I never had a faculty meeting once in a while.

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So...

443
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Was there any sense of the history of the program

444
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that had been around since 1898?

445
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
No.

446
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And in your research, you...

447
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Whatever you can find.

448
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And I don't mean this negatively, but...

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
There was a former dean named was Clausson.

450
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And he committed suicide.

451
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I actually had a graduate student who was an undergraduate here

452
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
at the time that occurred.

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't, to this day, know exactly what the situation.

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I obviously had depression of some type.

455
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And there was some story that he had run up gambling debts and so forth.

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But I honestly don't know the truth.

457
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
To his credit, he was a Minnesota grad, as I understand it.

458
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And he brought one of the first Rokai Rokai's

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
a National Pharmacy Honor Society.

460
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Toregan State, I remember what chapter we are.

461
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But we're one of the very early chapters.

462
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Is it a Phi Delta Phi?

463
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
No, no. Phi Delta Phi is a pharmacy fraternity, co-ed.

464
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There's no one called Kapasai, that I was a member of.

465
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
No, no. Rokai Rx.

466
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And there used to be a women's sorority.

467
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I think it's fallen by the wayside.

468
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, I know it has an Oregon state.

469
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And there were a faculty who were Phi Delta Chi who wanted...

470
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's why basically Phi Delta Chi.

471
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There used to be both Phi Delta Chi and Kapasai.

472
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Kapasai fell by the wayside and Phi Delta Chi has been the predominant.

473
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And I'm not sure how active it is anymore.

474
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But Rokai still initiates top students each year.

475
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
There is also a leadership group which is fairly new.

476
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And I don't know what it is.

477
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And I think it's Rokai to a joint induction ceremony,

478
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
to spring it.

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Los Alstoward or CH2M Hill, alumni center,

480
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
somewhere like that.

481
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So after Clawson died,

482
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
they brought in Charlie Wilson,

483
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
who had been at Minnesota,

484
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and was down at Texas.

485
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And he was co-author of a very famous well-established...

486
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
became very well-established medicinal chemistry textbook.

487
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It was Wilson and Gisffold.

488
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And Ole Gisffold was also at Minnesota.

489
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They started at Minnesota and it was the first.

490
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So when I had it as an undergraduate even,

491
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and the later got to be multi-authored,

492
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I ended up being a co-editor for a couple years of it,

493
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
an author of a chapter or two for one or two editions.

494
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Anyway, he came and his idea...

495
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He was told he was supposed to try to start increasing the research capability.

496
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So he was hiring young faculty out of grad school.

497
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
There was a new pharmaceutical person.

498
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He was a pharmacologist.

499
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Got a good grant fairly early.

500
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I never was able to get anything big.

501
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I would get smaller grants.

502
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And the pharmaceutical person went off to the industry.

503
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It was Diagnol Hauser.

504
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
There was an addition to the building maintenance.

505
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That was just going on.

506
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
When I interviewed, they were in the finishing state.

507
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I came in December for the...

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Well, it was the Christmas break.

509
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And in fact, you know how you usually pay

510
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
to bring a person out for an interview?

511
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
No.

512
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I took my wife to Yakima for the first time at Christmas time.

513
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
After Christmas, we drove down to...

514
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I took my...

515
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
My mother's car and drove down to Corvallis.

516
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Went through the interview.

517
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I think I might have got reimbursed for mileage later.

518
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He did pay for staying in a motel on the way back

519
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
because there have been quite a bit of snow.

520
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So got me cheap as far as...

521
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
There was no this hiring start-up money.

522
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Start-up your lab.

523
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But to answer your question, when I came,

524
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
the faculty had...

525
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
were scared around campus because of the addition.

526
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
When I arrived in September, they were all back in the new building.

527
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And the labs were set up.

528
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I see that was pretty impactful in these days.

529
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Potentially, yes.

530
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It did start some research going

531
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and they started to see some increase in graduate students.

532
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The...

533
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh, the USB Department of Pharmacy Administration with...

534
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
maybe one other faculty member in the department that I'm not sure made over to.

535
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
There's an interesting story that goes...

536
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Charlie Wilson worked very hard to get that addition put on.

537
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And the ledges...

538
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
he got approval and I guess eight...

539
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
but those days it definitely had to go through the legislature.

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And the new offices were all to be labs

541
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
with fume hoods

542
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and the faucets and the gas outlets and so on.

543
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
He...

544
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
went to NIH.

545
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Money was a lot more plentiful from the federal government those days.

546
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
He went to...

547
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and I think it was NIH, make sense.

548
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And got a grant to outfit these offices as labs.

549
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And unbelievable.

550
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The state said, we budgeted X amount of money.

551
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Since you got this federal money,

552
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
we're going to subtract the state money.

553
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so they had...

554
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
he sat down the plans and put X's through marking out which lab...

555
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
offices could have labs in which ones would not have fume hoods.

556
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Did you get one ahead of life?

557
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I had one ahead of hood, yeah.

558
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because I was a new young assistant professor.

559
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But, yeah, that's how strange things were in Oregon, for example.

560
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Which department were you in?

561
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Either we were called medicinal chemistry or pharmaceutical chemistry, I forgot which.

562
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
At the industrial level, the term pharmaceutical chemistry is what...

563
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it's an academic level we might call pharmaceutical, it's formulation.

564
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And the drug design is in medicinal chemistry.

565
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But in academia,

566
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
it's like pharmaceutical chemistry with the drug design area.

567
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So what were your responsibilities in this initial position?

568
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Well, I was very surprised.

569
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I was going to be teaching a lab in medicinal chemistry.

570
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I didn't think there was such a thing left.

571
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So I taught a lab in medicinal chemistry.

572
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Which took a lot of time.

573
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Was this... what do you mean by such a thing that was left as a sort of an older approach to...

574
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, yes, yes.

575
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh yeah, they did various...

576
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So, I build a...

577
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I honestly, gosh, cannot remember where these experiments came from and so forth.

578
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But, we slow...

579
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It took years to get rid of that lab.

580
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I did not teach in the farm.

581
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
We had a pharmaceutical analysis course.

582
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And there was a lab in that.

583
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And those labs slowly disappeared as more didactic material got into the course.

584
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I ended up starting the second year.

585
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I taught the biochemistry course.

586
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because that was my minor at Wisconsin.

587
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And the story on that is very, very interesting.

588
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I see a smile, so maybe you know part of the story.

589
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The dean and one of the other senior faculty had daughters, I think, both daughters,

590
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
who were in pharmacy and were really complaining about the quality of instruction

591
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
from the Department of Biochemistry.

592
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It used to be biochemistry and now it's biochemistry and bio physics.

593
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And one of the complaints was that each quarter they would keep changing instructors.

594
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And this would happen each year.

595
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So, over in the pharmacy school, you couldn't get a reading on what was being covered

596
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
when the students coming in who had had the biochemistry course because there was this rotation

597
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
of instructors going on.

598
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It was a service course.

599
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And the pharmacy students would start to complain when they were kind of a cohesive bunch.

600
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And that made the biochemistry faculty angry.

601
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And finally, the dean says, I'm going to yank the course.

602
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Start teaching a John and try to make it unique.

603
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Well, they had a rule in those days.

604
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
There was to be no duplication of course work on campus.

605
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And they really got a tight about it.

606
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But I did.

607
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And I started with a course towards a clinical approach and a nutrition approach.

608
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So, I started to change a lot of stuff.

609
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I mean, it was still basic biochemistry.

610
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It still went through intermeanory metabolism.

611
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We still went through protein chemistry.

612
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No labs though.

613
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Chemistry carbohydrates.

614
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And then what was known about DNA and RNA.

615
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And of course that is mushroomed.

616
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But I picked up and started to cover diabetes, biochemistry and diabetes.

617
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The biochemistry of hyperlipidemias.

618
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Before there was much known about hyperlipidemias.

619
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I think everything was cholesterol in those days.

620
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And so on.

621
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And then I wrote a paper for the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education on a clinical approach to teaching of biochemistry.

622
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Most successful paper ever wrote all my 100 reprints disappeared.

623
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They all got requested.

624
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I gave an oral presentation at the American Association College of Pharmacy.

625
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And it was packed.

626
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I was on a roll.

627
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It was not what you call a research paper.

628
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, the chair of biochemistry and another faculty member came over to have a meeting and said,

629
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
do we teach that?

630
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Well, they didn't teach that approach.

631
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And they find it up.

632
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And we just want you to know that we teach it too.

633
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But you can go ahead and teach your stuff.

634
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Okay.

635
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I got along actually with most of them over there.

636
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Fine.

637
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We got along.

638
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But every so often.

639
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It would come up.

640
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
One of the faculty members is over at Dixon in the dressing room.

641
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And it came up, you know, his faculty members in pharmacy.

642
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And this other, this fellow in biochemistry says,

643
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
so how come it is you keep teaching that biochemistry course?

644
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
There were the physical chemists in our living room.

645
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
My wife was very active with American field service AFS.

646
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And there was a group in our living room.

647
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And the physical organic chemist said,

648
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
hold the sun and blurt it out.

649
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know, you really have no business teaching biochemistry.

650
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It wasn't even his department.

651
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That's really, somewhere along the line.

652
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I had a different reputation, different parts of the campus, I guess.

653
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's kind of fun.

654
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Particularly once you get 10, you're what they're going to do, you know.

655
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But eventually when we went to the doctor of pharmacy program,

656
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
we met with Chris Matthews, a chair of biochemistry.

657
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And basically, they took the course back.

658
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And it was a higher level course that we had the students in,

659
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
rather than the service course.

660
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I told him what I was going to continue teaching,

661
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
which was the nutritional aspects in some of the diseases.

662
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And they said, fine, can anybody of our students come?

663
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I said, sure.

664
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But I don't think any day we did.

665
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So everything was fine.

666
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
My understanding now what they have done is they're only requiring

667
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the first two years, first two, some quarters of biochemistry,

668
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because we're still in the quarter system.

669
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I'm not sure how they're handling the molecular biology.

670
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It has changed so much.

671
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And with the heavy research emphasis, the faculty are extremely focused

672
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
doing their teaching.

673
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And you get such a turnover of faculty going on in the biochemistry.

674
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And that's our courses, too.

675
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
There's very rare where you'll see one faculty member.

676
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
She's a course from again, and there'll be a course coordinator,

677
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
who's basically the job is to make sure the grades get submitted on time

678
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
to the registrar.

679
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So there's a lot of this.

680
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You might say it's a medical school model that's going on.

681
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Did it seem that the pharmacy was resistant to change

682
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
in terms of the curriculum early on?

683
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No, in fact, just the opposite.

684
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
We always had curricular upheavals.

685
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And that was going on nationally, too.

686
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
There are all these trends.

687
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You got to change the clinical pharmacy.

688
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You got to do that.

689
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You got to do that.

690
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You got to put in communication skills.

691
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You got to put in cultural sensitivities.

692
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, no, no, no.

693
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
There's...

694
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It was always in state of flux.

695
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Always going through transitions.

696
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And what do you do about a student who was not right in sequence

697
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
in the curriculum changed that?

698
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What do you do for them?

699
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
No.

700
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Oh, no.

701
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That's just the opposite.

702
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We were very fluid.

703
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Tell me about setting up your research in OSU.

704
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That got off to a slow start.

705
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I basically had some undergraduates.

706
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And I really had trouble getting going.

707
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I did one based on my PhD and got the paper published.

708
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But I was always fascinated in what's called

709
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
my TAS structure activity relationships.

710
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And it's a statistical method of drug design.

711
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And I ended up with a graduate student named Doug Henry,

712
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
who was very good at statistics.

713
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And that's basically what Doug is where I got the bulk of my papers.

714
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I had a couple other graduate students who got papers.

715
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But overall, I basically got into the drug design area.

716
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And I was publishing in that area.

717
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I would go off to the Gordon Research Conference.

718
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I started to get a little bit of money from the Army.

719
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The Army.

720
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And it was not the chemical warfare bunch.

721
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That type.

722
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And go back to their research conferences and did certain things with them.

723
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I mean, published and nothing was classified.

724
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And I made a contact at a Gordon Conference.

725
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So let's say it was that.

726
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So that's the base what I did.

727
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I don't have that many papers.

728
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And I remember really got any real big grants.

729
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I think the biggest ever goes, 10 or 12,000.

730
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Was the model pharmacy, the model drug store still around?

731
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh, and I came.

732
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, there was a prescription lab.

733
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And they had cubicles.

734
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So the students learned to dispense.

735
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And there was phones.

736
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And some faculty member or grad student

737
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
would function as a doctorate point in prescriptions.

738
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So there was still that, yes.

739
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But that's disappeared.

740
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
What was your sense of the climate on campus when you arrived

741
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
in the 60s, proceeded in that sort of well?

742
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I won't arose.

743
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
When I bicycle onto the campus that late September,

744
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
first day of classes, there was a group of freshmen in green beanies.

745
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And I was dumbfounded.

746
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I could not believe this.

747
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Because I'd been to Washington State.

748
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It was not such a thing as green.

749
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It was just a regular university.

750
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I could not believe it.

751
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It was a cow college.

752
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It was an ag school.

753
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
When I saw the PhD curriculum,

754
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
it was loaded with coursework.

755
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And the story goes.

756
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I have one emphasized story because I never heard it face-to-face.

757
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But the dean of the graduate school in those days believed in lots of coursework.

758
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Because he knew that Oregon State PhD graduates were not going to go

759
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to the big research universities.

760
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
They were going to go to the smaller schools and be teachers.

761
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So they need to take a lot of coursework so they could teach a number of subjects.

762
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Oh, well that's interesting.

763
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
When, obviously I knew I wanted to get tenured.

764
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And in my third year, I got a letter from the president of the university,

765
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Dr. Jensen, saying,

766
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You have tenured.

767
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I like this.

768
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I like this place.

769
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay, I wasn't promoted yet, but I had tenured after three years.

770
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And you don't have to go through any sort of...

771
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh no, no.

772
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Okay, and then he retires

773
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and goes off with the Rockefeller Foundation somewhere.

774
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And they bring in President McVicar, Robert McVicar,

775
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
who was a one-man show.

776
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
There's no question about it.

777
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
A one-man show.

778
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Turned out he was a member of our church.

779
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And so at our annual church picnic, he was there with his wife,

780
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and there was a OSU faculty member who was taking him around introduced.

781
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And so I got introduced to him.

782
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well, it turned out that I had learned ahead of time that yes,

783
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
he was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, his PhDs in biochemistry.

784
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And a person who I actually taught my major professors course

785
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
to the undergraduate of Wisconsin.

786
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And there was an individual who was on sabbatical from industry.

787
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
A man named Dave Perlman, who was just a gentleman.

788
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And he gave the vitamin lectures in this course.

789
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And somewhere along the line Dave Perlman told me,

790
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
oh, Mac, as McVicar was called.

791
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And I were graduate students in the same lab in Madison.

792
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Say hello to him.

793
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And then Perlman later became dean of Wisconsin.

794
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So here I am at median president of Vicar.

795
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And I said, yeah, I know Dave Perlman.

796
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, and he's now keeping, he's both dean and maintain his research program.

797
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And Mac's comment was, well, it's only dean of a pharmacy school.

798
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I went back and told Dean Wilson, I said, you got a problem.

799
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
You got a big problem.

800
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
He did have a problem that turns out.

801
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Well, he went on business retirement and so forth.

802
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No matter everything he said, I've never heard of Mac firing anybody without due cause.

803
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But what happened getting on back to my own personal.

804
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I went up for promotion.

805
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And it was turned down.

806
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
This happened to all over campus because he wanted a standard dossier

807
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
where you use outside referees.

808
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well, it threw my department, he didn't know what to do.

809
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But to Wilson's credit, Dean Wilson's credit, who had been at Minnesota and at Texas.

810
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
He knew exactly where Mac was coming from and what had to be done.

811
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And he says, okay, here is what we are going to do.

812
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
We've got the outline.

813
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I need outside referees.

814
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And so I may have professors at school's function.

815
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And then I got, I did get promoted the next time around.

816
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And then made it to professor on the first time around on that.

817
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So, but that was happening all over campus.

818
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And not only were young faculty in Shell Shock,

819
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
but you had department heads who had never been turned down all they did.

820
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It was right, letters saying they wanted so-and-so promoted and tenured.

821
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And it was done.

822
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You had deans who had never been turned down.

823
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And it was, how do you look back on your laugh?

824
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But oh yeah, it was a traumatic time.

825
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
There was no question about it.

826
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But the result was Oregon State University today.

827
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And what I never have understood is why there's no building or anything like that named after him.

828
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
There are young faculty.

829
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I have no idea who he, who Mac was.

830
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And you gave him a lot of credit for propelling university for it.

831
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, I would say he, without him, we would still be second fiddle to the University of Oregon.

832
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And I mean, real second fiddle.

833
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I think Portland State could be ahead of us.

834
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
No, he knew what had to be done.

835
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And he pushed.

836
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And as I said, he is, as one person said, he was his own provost.

837
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We had a dean of faculty in those days.

838
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Dave Nicodemus, who was kind of the good cop.

839
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And Mac was the bad cop as the president of university.

840
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But I know, and he had quite a temper, boy, he could flare.

841
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But I don't know if anybody who was out fired, who locked horns with him.

842
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
He just let fly.

843
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
But I just, I don't know if anybody who was, and I'm not saying there wasn't.

844
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But he really followed protocol.

845
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,000
When we did not grant tenure to a faculty member, boy, he wanted to make sure everything was dotted.

846
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And he reviewed it carefully.

847
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I think one thing he didn't want to get lost, it was obviously.

848
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But I think he, I think basically, have you ever read about this fellow who was present for a long time at Boston?

849
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
He did a Boston College or Boston University, Silverman, John Silverman.

850
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And there's a review in the Wall Street Journal of a book he had written.

851
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Well, he's dead now, so much a minute, a couple of years ago.

852
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But he brought the school up into a major research university and hired top notch faculty.

853
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And he believed in academic freedom.

854
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But he also wanted to believe in excellence.

855
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And it caused a real transformation.

856
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And I kind of look at the two people.

857
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Mac never wrote a book, as far as I know.

858
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
As the two of the same type, they had this goal and they know it could be done.

859
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And if I get the right faculty, I know it can be done.

860
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And he basically did.

861
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
What does he remember about him as a person that sounds like you knew him a little bit?

862
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
A little kind of a personal level.

863
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He was very distant.

864
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And I say we were in the same church and he just never seemed to let his guard down till after he retired.

865
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
He just lived over here.

866
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
A couple blocks away.

867
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And one day after he retired.

868
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't know if he's here with a petition for us to sign or what, but he showed up to the house.

869
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Come on in.

870
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
He went down on the couch out there and just talked.

871
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
He even talked about being hired and things.

872
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He'd yes.

873
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Everything was fine.

874
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
He was retired now.

875
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
There was no barrier between us.

876
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
There was a neighborhood dessert from our church.

877
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And we got the thing mixed up on the counter.

878
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So my wife knocked.

879
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I pushed a doorbell and they said, well, we're here for the dessert.

880
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Well, that was last night or last week.

881
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh gosh.

882
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
He said, come on in.

883
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I think we have some pie.

884
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
We have some cake.

885
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And his life is always very gracious.

886
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And we sat down to visit for a while.

887
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Well, what other colleagues of yours were important to you in OSU within pharmacy or elsewhere?

888
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, there was that my department had Bob Dorby, who was very good.

889
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The one that we were basically parallel to each other was George Constantine.

890
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Who's here?

891
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I mean, he's over at Albany, but he's not the one you could always interview.

892
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Let's see.

893
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:21,000
As far as contemporaries, I would say those two for the most part.

894
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And doing some research on the pharmacy is sort of more recent here.

895
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Is that a couple of names that have stood out as people who have made an impact?

896
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

897
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm going to speak one more.

898
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
The dean who, the gentleman who replaced Charlie Wilson was Dick O'Call.

899
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Who was there for a long time?

900
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yes.

901
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And he once, he, he said, John, how would you like to be on the Board of Pharmacy?

902
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I thought, okay, that sounds like an intriguing deal because I wasn't setting the world on fire research-wise.

903
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And this is a State Board of Pharmacy.

904
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yes, a State Board of Pharmacy.

905
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So I think I put my name in and the old guard in the profession that I'm a faculty member on the Board of Pharmacy.

906
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's ridiculous.

907
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And the vacancy came up again.

908
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
He says, let's make another run at it.

909
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And I don't know what I have behind the scenes, but I got appointed at the Board of Pharmacy.

910
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Neil Goldschmidt.

911
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Now, he didn't know me from Adam.

912
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It's all done by the appointments office.

913
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And they, of course, checked politics.

914
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
The Board of Pharmacy, I'm sure, was not on the Goldschmidt's political radar screen.

915
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So I got on the Board.

916
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And there was an executive director on the Board, Ruth Vanderbier, at a real vision where pharmacy could go.

917
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
She had basically been the author of the Revise Pharmacy Practice Act, which gave pharmacists a lot more responsibility in the state.

918
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And I started to go to the National Association of the Board of Pharmacy and regional meetings.

919
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I ended up offering a couple of resolutions, got on to task force of the Board.

920
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I ended up being on one of the permanent committees of the National Association Board of Pharmacy on one of the exam committees for foreign pharmacy graduates.

921
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So that, that, I would say Dick had a real impact.

922
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I was on the Board for the mandatory eight years.

923
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
When I say mandatory, it can't exceed eight years.

924
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And most President of the Board, twice.

925
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I was going to ask you about a couple of fellows from the pharmacy department or the school of pharmacy.

926
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It sounded like it made an impact through their research.

927
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And one of them is James Ayers.

928
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Oh, yes, yes.

929
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
He was on sabbatical somewhere.

930
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And I got a call from Professor Sandin, a microbiology.

931
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And I want to say it's Bill Sandin, but I may have the first name wrong, but anyway, Sandin.

932
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And he wanted some way to develop some method of buffering bacterial cultures in the cheese making process.

933
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And I said, well, the formulation person is Jim Ayers.

934
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And so Jim comes back and they meet each other and they kept quite a collaboration going and had one of the most successful patents of that era.

935
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And Jim may still, and I don't know if the college is still getting some money.

936
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Of course, Jim getting some money.

937
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
This is the time release.

938
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Time release, yes, right.

939
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yeah, Jim had, he had, he developed industrial contacts.

940
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
He probably had one of the biggest graduate programs.

941
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
He believed he's completely retired on the coast now.

942
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And he no longer have a home here in Corvallis.

943
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
How about William Gerwig?

944
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, yes, yes.

945
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
He and I actually co-taught in the biochemistry course.

946
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But Bill developed a fabulous natural products and was eventually hired away by the University of California at San Diego.

947
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But he had a large program, a very large program.

948
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
He took a sabbatical in 1972, called Jurassic.

949
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes.

950
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Only about that.

951
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Well, I wouldn't take a sabbatical, you know, people do.

952
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So we arranged for the house to be rented by, I think, a couple that was on sabbatical from somewhere else.

953
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And went down, stayed rented a house by an interesting older Polish couple,

954
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
who had not been back to Poland since the Second World War.

955
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And I think family there.

956
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So I worked in Karl Terassi's lab.

957
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
He's quite an individual.

958
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And of course the father's birth control pill, so on.

959
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And got four papers out.

960
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It was a natural products lab.

961
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Because without we were going to get really Sea Grant going.

962
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And we had various ideas.

963
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And somehow we never could tap into that well into the Sea Grant money here.

964
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But we thought we'd get a marine natural products thing going.

965
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It never did work out.

966
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But yeah, it was a good year.

967
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Did you get to know him very well?

968
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
He's one of these people that has a fantastic memory.

969
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So he got to know you more than you got to know him.

970
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I mean, I was working on one of the papers.

971
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And I said, I bend the cam abstracts.

972
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm not finding this reference.

973
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
He got up and went over to his card file.

974
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Pulled out something from don't ask how all that paper was says here.

975
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And he didn't do it in a way that I felt like shrinking in the floor.

976
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I don't know how I missed this.

977
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Well, obviously I did.

978
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You didn't have computerized search in the cam abstracts in those days.

979
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It was all done manually with big thick volumes and fine print.

980
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But anyway, he came up here once he retired as a chemist

981
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and has written three or four novels and some plays.

982
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Sort of a Renaissance man, I'd have to say.

983
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And he came up, I can't remember who brought him up.

984
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But I went over during a break and reintroduced myself.

985
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
He seemed to remember who I was.

986
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
He was friends with Linus Pauling who was also in the Stanford area at the time.

987
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah, and I can't remember if I did go over here when Pauling's lectures were not.

988
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Pauling came back to campus a few times too.

989
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You know, it was you.

990
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yes, oh yeah.

991
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And the only time I heard him on campus that I'm aware of,

992
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I can't remember if I went to any of the peace lectures later on.

993
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The end after it made his wife.

994
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But there was that one time when the Afro-American football players walked off the campus

995
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
because of the beard incident with, er, and moustache incident with Deandreus, the football coach.

996
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And Pauling was to speak at Gil Colosseum.

997
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And the students came in and Jensen was president.

998
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It was a, it was an awkward situation.

999
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And I think Jensen felt very hurt by that because I think Bacy was a very fair man.

1000
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But you're dealing with a powerful football coach who had powerful alumni behind him.

1001
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So it was an awkward situation.

1002
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And I probably went ahead and gave his talk.

1003
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You mentioned Dean Oval.

1004
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
He was a Dean for 22 years, the longest serving Dean of his generation in pharmacy, apparently.

1005
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It sounds like there were at least a couple of changes that he invoked.

1006
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And one of them you mentioned a little bit was that emphasis on increased experience in patient care.

1007
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Well, that was going on during the, er, I would say that that was a trend in pharmacy education

1008
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
all across the United States.

1009
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I knew it was very, I mean, it was going to make sure we stayed current.

1010
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
As part of that, the curriculum added clinical components.

1011
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Can I ask you to turn that off?

1012
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And I'll tell you why.

1013
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Act two.

1014
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So we were talking about changes in the curriculum and the focus on clinical components, including communication skills.

1015
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yeah, the history of communication has been a very interesting one.

1016
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
For a long time, the pre-pharmacy curriculum had some type of speech requirement.

1017
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And the question was always, what is the appropriate type of speech requirement?

1018
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Is it it?

1019
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So I think the word expository speech, where you get up and give your three-minute speech, or your five-minute speech.

1020
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Which is not what pharmacists do.

1021
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They talk one and one like you and I are talking to each other.

1022
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And so what you want is, they're apparently, it was a speech course.

1023
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's supposed they was more how to interact one-on-one rather than with an audience.

1024
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm not sure if there's still a speech requirement in the pre-pharmacy curriculum or not.

1025
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It wasn't there when I was an undergraduate, I can tell you that.

1026
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I had it in high school.

1027
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But what happened was, was mandatory counseling.

1028
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
In fact, I was on the Board of Pharmacy when the mandatory counseling requirement went in.

1029
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And it was happening across the United States.

1030
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Part of it was patient, better patient care.

1031
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Part of it was, get the pharmacists out there talking with the patient,

1032
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
rather than hiding behind the counter and having some sales clerk down there at all.

1033
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So, one of our, well I guess you call them factoring,

1034
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
the fact that Mary's the director of student health service pharmacy, Bill Boyce,

1035
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
and actually pioneered the technique for how to consult a patient.

1036
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And there's a little card and there's three questions on it.

1037
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I can't remember how they went.

1038
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But basically it was, what did your physician tell you about this medicine?

1039
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So, your first of all rather than get through this lecture,

1040
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I mean you're trying to find out what the patient's understanding.

1041
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So, you're not talking down to them.

1042
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And that's also a good way to do an error check into the last minute.

1043
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Because if you're handing them an antibiotic and the patient says,

1044
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
it's for my high blood pressure, you know, just hang on a moment.

1045
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
We've got to check this out.

1046
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But okay, we'll assume it's the correct prescription.

1047
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Another question might be, what did the,

1048
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
and you could elaborate on the response or, yes, I see you have a good understanding.

1049
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
What did the physician explain to you on how to take it?

1050
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And you find out, do they realize they are to take it?

1051
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Four meals or two hours after a meal.

1052
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And I can't remember if the third one,

1053
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
whether you have any other question you want to ask me,

1054
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
or did the physician explain any of the pertinent side effects?

1055
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And there you're trying to, you're not trying to scare the patient,

1056
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
or they'll never take it.

1057
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
But you might also, or if you do get a certain type of sensation,

1058
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
you need to either call your physician or call us

1059
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
rather than simply go up and give them a spiel.

1060
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You're trying to teach that type of communication on a one-on-one basis.

1061
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Most of the pharmacies are not even set up for it,

1062
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
so you're trying to have some place in a corner where nobody else can hear the conversation.

1063
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
But depending on the noise of the story is,

1064
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Fred Meyer, they probably can't hear it because of all the noise.

1065
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Ryze, I think you can hear the conversation.

1066
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I have a silly question.

1067
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I probably wouldn't even ask before it.

1068
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The pharmacists interpret the handwriting of doctors and the scripts that they receive.

1069
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
A lot of it is practice.

1070
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
A lot of it is now electronic transmission.

1071
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And one of the most important things is phone and find out what it is that was written.

1072
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So there isn't any secret code?

1073
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
No, no.

1074
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And they're not supposed to write in a Latin anymore.

1075
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
In fact, they don't write in a Latin.

1076
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's kind of living through your career.

1077
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well, one of the resolutions, and we finally got through the National Association of Borders of Pharmacy,

1078
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
was the test of spoken English.

1079
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Not written English.

1080
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
They're supposed to do that also.

1081
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
spoken English was very interesting to see the opposition.

1082
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And of course, there was all this about a political correctness,

1083
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
but you had to explain that the communication media

1084
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:44,000
is you could have a resident at a medical center

1085
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
who is from one country in Asia,

1086
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
talking to a pharmacist who is from India.

1087
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And the only thing they've got in common is the English language.

1088
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Not saying the Asian one maybe that is good in English is the Indian one.

1089
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
The point is airline pilots and the control towers use English.

1090
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So now if a pharmacist is dual language,

1091
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
so they can talk in another language and explain the directions,

1092
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
or hand the person a information sheet in the patient's native language,

1093
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
some of the computer programs will do that.

1094
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Great, that's excellent.

1095
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But still got to be able to speak it.

1096
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I want to ask you about you served on a National Science Foundation panel

1097
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
for instructional scientific equipment.

1098
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I did, you're right.

1099
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I've gotten about that.

1100
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah, I was down in, I think Los Angeles,

1101
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I think we all went down there.

1102
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It was for undergraduate research,

1103
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and it was a very interesting panel.

1104
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And I'm not quite sure how my name got in there.

1105
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
God, I never got funded by it.

1106
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I'm not sure if I replied.

1107
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:14,000
But what was fascinating was you had good, solid liberal arts schools,

1108
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
the Louis and Clark, and this date the Louis and Clarks,

1109
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
the reads, the Williamins, for example, applying for,

1110
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
they wanted a new NMR, a new updated infrared spectrum,

1111
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
putometer for their lab.

1112
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
They would be used and they would outline the courses that would be used in,

1113
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and also how it would function for undergraduate research projects.

1114
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And they would also be able to show how they would be able to support the instrument

1115
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,000
that they had the technicians available to keep it going or experience faculty.

1116
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And you'd fund those.

1117
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Then you would get a little small liberal arts college

1118
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
that maybe had one chemist, two of they were lucky,

1119
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
who wanted this fancy piece of equipment.

1120
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And you say, how are they going to maintain it?

1121
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Do you understand how it works?

1122
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Where is the course that's going to be used in?

1123
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
We wouldn't fund it.

1124
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Or you got the application from the chemistry department at the University of California,

1125
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
or the University of Wisconsin and Madison,

1126
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
who just had to have a new hot shot NMR,

1127
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
and they were going to let the undergraduates walk by essentially.

1128
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
No, we didn't fund that either.

1129
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So we basically funded liberal arts program.

1130
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Well, it didn't have to be, I'm sorry, I don't want to imply it had to be a private liberal arts school.

1131
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
A school like Western probably would not have any problem either.

1132
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
They had to have a substantial, we were doing it in the chemistry area now please.

1133
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Keep that in mind, speaking of the discipline.

1134
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
They had to have a core of faculty.

1135
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
One thing that really helped them was,

1136
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
did they have a program that met the undergraduates of the American Chemical Society,

1137
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
which means they had to have, and that had basically faculty in each of the disciplines,

1138
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
organic, physical, analytical.

1139
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,000
The seemingly important point in the modern history of the College of Pharmacy came in 1988

1140
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
when the satellite campus was formed at OHSU.

1141
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That is still a dynamic situation.

1142
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:43,000
The Oregon State, like some of the other pharmacy schools of history,

1143
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
historical, are not out on a campus where there is a medical center.

1144
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And then the big debate is, does the school move to where the medical center is,

1145
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
or is the school stay where it is and try to do the satellite campus?

1146
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And of course, we did the latter.

1147
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Part of it is, how would you move our whole research emphasis and productivity?

1148
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
We are very productive.

1149
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
If you take a look at the amount of grant money,

1150
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
this pharmacy school is now bringing in.

1151
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Where would, how would it be situated?

1152
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Where would be the support infrastructure?

1153
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I mean, there's quite a dynamic support all across campus.

1154
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
There's the mass spec centers, there's the NMR centers, and so forth.

1155
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So there's a real good synergism on a campus like this.

1156
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And so how would that be handled in Portland area?

1157
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Because there's not a major, excuse me, Portland state,

1158
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
but there's not a major research university there.

1159
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Portland state has got some real strong areas, don't please don't misunderstand me.

1160
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And OHSU is a medical center.

1161
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:04,000
They're not teaching the basic science courses that would feed into a medical center.

1162
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The students all come in for somewhere else.

1163
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So that's one thing.

1164
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So initially was to get the clinical program established up there for the fourth year

1165
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and try to get rotations.

1166
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And that took a lot of missionary work, you might say,

1167
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
to get the medical center to accept it.

1168
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It seems to be working very well now.

1169
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It really is.

1170
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And of course, there's both the medical center, OHSU, and there is the VA.

1171
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And there's the other big hospitals,

1172
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:52,000
legacy, Providence, Kaiser.

1173
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
There is, I'm trying to think of basic pharmaceutical sciences.

1174
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And I have the impression that one of the sizes is only an impression

1175
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
that there is some pharmaceuticals now up in Portland,

1176
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
as opposed to just the clinical.

1177
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Well, another important moment came 11 years later,

1178
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
when OHSU decided no longer to offer the bachelor's degree in pharmacy

1179
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and focus solely on the farm D.

1180
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Oh, yes, that's got a very interesting history.

1181
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
The question was, was money for one thing to find answer,

1182
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
because you need an additional faculty, particularly in the clinical area.

1183
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And you had to pay going wages,

1184
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
because they could all work in the private sector.

1185
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So the question came up, and I remember Dick talking of a dickhole home,

1186
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
talking about it, was, do we start a small farm D program,

1187
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and just kind of shoehorn it in.

1188
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And there was some type of educational coordinating committee

1189
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
that was they had to approve new programs,

1190
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
that would eliminate duplication.

1191
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I think it's passed by the wayside now.

1192
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And the chair of that committee made the comment.

1193
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
He says, no, you wait until we can have a good program.

1194
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
We want excellent program.

1195
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The other thing they did at the state level was saying,

1196
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
you can't have a professional doctor program unless the students

1197
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
have a bachelor's degree.

1198
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And there are these pharmacy schools, unfortunately, in my opinion.

1199
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
A student can go through and get a doctor pharmacy degree

1200
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and not have any bachelor's degree.

1201
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Well, can you imagine a medical physician not having a bachelor's degree?

1202
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
As far as I know, as Dennis do, I think all the lawyers now have bachelor's degree

1203
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
before they get their doctor, jurisprudence.

1204
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And so, we worked out essentially a seven-year program.

1205
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Three-year pre-farmacy.

1206
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
We made arrangements with general science

1207
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
that they would accept courses in the first professional year,

1208
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
maybe some in the second, towards the general science degree.

1209
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So, if they don't have a bachelor's degree,

1210
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
they will by the end of their second professional year,

1211
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and they have to, before they take their last two years.

1212
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Now it turns out, I believe, over 90% are coming in with bachelor's degrees now.

1213
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But we were one of the first schools to require this bachelor's degree requirement.

1214
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I think Ohio State was coming to the other OSU, ironically,

1215
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
or coincidentally, or whatever.

1216
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I believe the University of California, San Francisco,

1217
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
is always, oh, I should say we're one of the first.

1218
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think they always, they're one of the pioneers for the FarmD program.

1219
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And I think they always require a bachelor's degree.

1220
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I think they always did.

1221
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And that may have been true of USC also.

1222
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
My understanding is a large number of the state pharmacy schools,

1223
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
the well-established state, you know, at the state universities,

1224
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
are now, have got so much in their pre-farmacy that,

1225
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
essentially, there's a bachelor's degree requirement.

1226
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I don't know about Pacific, for example,

1227
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
a person who didn't walk in office three to four years or a year later,

1228
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
actually, they have a year around curriculum, three and a half years,

1229
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
walk out with a farm degree without a bachelor's degree.

1230
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I don't know, frankly.

1231
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Well, it sounds like that this shift to the pharmacy

1232
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
led to an even closer entire of the way.

1233
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yes, you became a degree between the two universities.

1234
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Because it required more clinical faculty,

1235
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
it required more clerkships,

1236
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and more making more rounds than that.

1237
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yes, yes.

1238
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
There's no question about it.

1239
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I want to talk a little bit more about your career.

1240
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You mentioned your time on the Oregon Board of Pharmacy.

1241
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
One of the interesting things that you were involved with there was

1242
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
assisting with the interpreting and implementation of the plan

1243
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
for assisted suicide law.

1244
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I want to talk about that.

1245
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yes!

1246
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
That was a fascinating experience.

1247
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Here was a situation.

1248
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You had the potentiality of a pharmacist who was opposed to it,

1249
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
receiving a prescription

1250
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and not realizing why they were dispensing it.

1251
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And in fact, they, under the patient constant,

1252
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
they make a lot and give a bunch of goofy advice.

1253
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And may not even realize what was happening.

1254
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And then you had the situation where they had,

1255
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and I'm not going to dispense this and pull it back.

1256
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So, there were various scenarios.

1257
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
The sponsors of the Physician-Sister Suicide

1258
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
made no, if Hanson buts about it,

1259
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
there was to be nothing hidden from the pharmacist,

1260
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
nurses, anybody who could be an open process,

1261
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
anybody who did not want to participate,

1262
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
needing, and they actually had networks of physicians and pharmacists

1263
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
and nurses, so forth, who were positive.

1264
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
They could always put a family in touch,

1265
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
get them into the system.

1266
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So, we went back and forth with the Board of Medical Examiners.

1267
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
No, no, scratch that.

1268
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
We went back and forth with the Oregon Medical Association.

1269
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It turned out that we've seen pretty well have the support

1270
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
of the physicians, including the officers,

1271
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
but there was a lobbyist who has taken his cue

1272
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
from the American Medical Association

1273
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and if a physician doesn't want to tell the pharmacist

1274
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
anything, that's it.

1275
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
God has spoken.

1276
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And so, we finally wrote a rule that said physicians

1277
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
had to tell the pharmacists.

1278
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Well, all of a sudden you had the Board of Pharmacy

1279
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
write a rule covering the pharmacists.

1280
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
The Board of Medical Examiners were not upset

1281
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
because they couldn't get it.

1282
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
They were being shoved, not pushed, not to.

1283
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And we now had our rule.

1284
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And the physician, the Oregon Medical Association,

1285
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
they're lobbyists, didn't like it at all.

1286
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So, of course, by this time I believe Dr. Kitsopper

1287
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
was governor.

1288
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And so, we, in the meantime,

1289
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
we were trying to get through a collaborative drug treatment

1290
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
through which we had a trained general

1291
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
who says we had the authority to do,

1292
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
but the drug industry didn't like it.

1293
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And this is where pharmacists can be involved

1294
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
in working out the treatment modalities

1295
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and the dosage and so forth.

1296
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So, another Board member and I were called into

1297
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
the governor's health advisor office.

1298
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And basically what the governor did,

1299
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
he told the medical board,

1300
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
you take that Board of Pharmacy Rule

1301
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
and you rewrite it with your name on it,

1302
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
instead of their name,

1303
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
and you push it through which they did.

1304
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
If that there was a draft and we approved it,

1305
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that was fine.

1306
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We didn't care.

1307
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
All we wanted was the pharmacists

1308
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
to call that these prescriptions were coming through.

1309
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And so, we told the health advisor,

1310
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
that's fine with us.

1311
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And then he says,

1312
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
so what now is it you're trying to do?

1313
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And we mentioned collaborative drug therapy.

1314
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And this fellow head was a former EMT

1315
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
or something on the ambulance.

1316
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
That's how he knew Kitsopper.

1317
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
They were fishing buddies from Southern Oregon.

1318
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And he looked and says,

1319
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
well, is that like when I'm on the ambulance,

1320
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I start the IV.

1321
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And for a person in cardiac arrest,

1322
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
and said, yeah, he says,

1323
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
oh, okay, you got it.

1324
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I'll tell the lobbyist from the OMA

1325
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
that it's going to go through.

1326
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So we got what we wanted,

1327
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
and the physicians got,

1328
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
well, they know they got what they wanted,

1329
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
but at least they have face saving on it.

1330
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So yeah, that's the story.

1331
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
We're all happy campers now.

1332
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You mentioned, too,

1333
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
that you started on the foreign pharmacy graduate equivalency examination committee.

1334
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah, that's the exam committee

1335
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
with the National Association Board of Pharmacy.

1336
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
What did that entail?

1337
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Oh, you had a significant number

1338
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
of graduates of foreign pharmacy schools

1339
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
that wanted to immigrate

1340
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
to the United States in practice pharmacy.

1341
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And we had no,

1342
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
there's no equivalent of a basic pharmacy medical exam,

1343
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
basic medical science exam.

1344
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
There's something that medical schools have

1345
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
after a couple of years,

1346
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I guess everybody takes this test

1347
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
before they go out in the clinch.

1348
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I'm really not quite sure how it works,

1349
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
but there apparently is some type of standard test.

1350
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
There's nothing like that with pharmacy.

1351
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So this is the closest thing to it.

1352
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And there's other requirements for the graduate.

1353
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
They've had to have so many years

1354
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
in a pharmacy school

1355
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that has to meet certain curricular standards

1356
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
and so on.

1357
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And there is a test of spoken English,

1358
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
by the way, they have to pass.

1359
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And of course,

1360
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
the test of English

1361
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
or the foreign language,

1362
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
they have to pass that also.

1363
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
So basically,

1364
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
there's a bank of questions

1365
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
that we work on,

1366
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I have to be in the medicinal chemistry area.

1367
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
That's supposed to be equivalent

1368
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
to what,

1369
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
if they can pass it,

1370
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
then they have at least the minimum standards

1371
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
of graduating in the dike-dactic coursework

1372
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
in a pharmacy school.

1373
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Now, they still have to do their interning

1374
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
and that sort of thing.

1375
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So I was in the medicinal chemistry

1376
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
we meet twice a year.

1377
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
We would come up with questions

1378
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
just like SATs,

1379
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
any of these questions

1380
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
that are on there that are going to count

1381
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and there's questions that are being tested

1382
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
to see if they're discriminating

1383
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
or they're too difficult,

1384
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
or they're too easy.

1385
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And so we would be working on new questions

1386
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
plus trying to fix the questions

1387
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
that didn't test right.

1388
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And one of the things I did was

1389
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
in the pioneer,

1390
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
as they developed this exam,

1391
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
the chemistry portion,

1392
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
some of the chemical structures

1393
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
were pretty bad.

1394
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
They were bad.

1395
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So I said,

1396
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
well, I've got a ChemDraw program,

1397
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
which was sort of the standard.

1398
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And so I worked out a deal with them.

1399
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I didn't get paid,

1400
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
but I redrew hundreds and hundreds of structures

1401
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
using the same program.

1402
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Something else that you worked on

1403
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
that is interesting to me

1404
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and my background with Linus Pauli,

1405
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
he developed them all for General Amesthesia.

1406
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And I understand that that's something

1407
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
you studied to the controversy

1408
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
over General Amesthesia.

1409
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Well, that's one of the contracts

1410
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
with the Army.

1411
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
And we were trying to see

1412
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
if there was a receptor forward.

1413
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I think there is,

1414
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
because they've got optically active,

1415
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
stereotypical,

1416
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
sit left and right,

1417
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
and molecules,

1418
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
one is active,

1419
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
the other is not.

1420
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So there must be some type of receptor.

1421
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
But that never led to anything.

1422
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Do I understand correctly

1423
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
there is still no accepted theory

1424
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
of why General Amesthesia was?

1425
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I think there is some theories for it,

1426
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
but there's some about nerve conduction

1427
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
where it's going depolarization

1428
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
and neurons.

1429
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I think there is some of that now,

1430
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
because they can visualize the brain

1431
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
so much differently nowadays,

1432
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
with the various types of scans,

1433
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
the PET scanners,

1434
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and all that,

1435
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
but they can get some idea

1436
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
which neurons are firing,

1437
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
which part of the brain

1438
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
is reacting in certain ways.

1439
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
So I think they're closer.

1440
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
We retired in 2003 after 37 years

1441
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
in the College of Pharmacy,

1442
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and we saw a lot of change,

1443
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
and we reflected on the changes

1444
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
in the college over that,

1445
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
of course, at that time.

1446
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Well, I mean,

1447
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
we've been talking about them,

1448
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
but BC has started out to be a traditional five-year

1449
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
bachelor degree program,

1450
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
medicinal chemistry,

1451
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
pharmaceutical analysis,

1452
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
formulation,

1453
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
for basic pharmaceuticals,

1454
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
what they called physical pharmacy,

1455
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
dosing standard,

1456
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
classic pharmacology,

1457
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
and they were still teaching pharmacy management

1458
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
if you're going to have your own drug store.

1459
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
So I think there was some accounting in there,

1460
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and as it became more and more obvious

1461
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
that pharmacists were going to be employees,

1462
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
you saw the management evolved

1463
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
into pharmacy socioeconomic,

1464
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
so you started,

1465
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
they started to be the discussion

1466
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
of healthcare delivery,

1467
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
which population groups

1468
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
can get it,

1469
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and why,

1470
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
which ones cannot get it,

1471
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
and why not,

1472
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
various types of insurance models out there,

1473
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
then, as I said,

1474
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
the labs disappeared

1475
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
as far as the pharmaceutical sciences went.

1476
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
There is still...

1477
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I think they still do a little bit of compounding,

1478
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
some basic compounding,

1479
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
but I think that's about it,

1480
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and I'm not even sure it's a small lab

1481
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
and they got some sterile hoods,

1482
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
and I think that's about all they're doing.

1483
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I think,

1484
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I may be wrong on that,

1485
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
you'd have to ask somebody,

1486
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
like the associate dean or somebody to ask them.

1487
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Big emphasis on patient care,

1488
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
big emphasis on the clinical pharmacy aspect,

1489
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
which is person has a certain disease

1490
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
or a couple of diseases,

1491
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and this drug causes this side effect,

1492
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
and this drug,

1493
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and our person shows up,

1494
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and they're taking six or eight,

1495
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and I'm not exaggerating,

1496
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
six or eight different drugs,

1497
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and cannot be whittled down to three or four,

1498
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
because they take a drug,

1499
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
they get a side effect,

1500
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
they get a drug to treat the side effect,

1501
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and so on,

1502
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
gets messy.

1503
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Of course,

1504
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
with the area diabetes,

1505
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
just use as an example,

1506
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
not used to be basically insulin,

1507
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and a couple oral medications,

1508
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
well, there's several oral,

1509
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and there's a whole bunch of other drugs

1510
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
that have been discovered

1511
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
that affect the pancreas,

1512
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
that affect the alpha cells,

1513
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
or the beta cells,

1514
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
and then there's even looking at the auto-eminology aspect

1515
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:05,000
of it all on the clinical side.

1516
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I know that one of the pursuits

1517
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
that you've followed retirement

1518
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
is you're going to your Medicare resource.

1519
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Yeah, and this date is called

1520
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Shiba Senior Health Benefit Assistance Program,

1521
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
which that notebook is sitting over there

1522
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
and you're beside you there.

1523
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Nationally, it's SHIP,

1524
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program,

1525
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
which the A haven't been dropped.

1526
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Until very recently,

1527
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
we were part of Center

1528
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

1529
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'd have to go to the computer

1530
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
and find out who the new federal agency is we're on.

1531
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
We are moving under,

1532
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I don't guess the move is not complete yet.

1533
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And I'm not sure,

1534
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
politically, what the heck was going on

1535
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
and we got moved.

1536
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
But we go...

1537
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I started back in 2005

1538
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
when the Part D drug programs began.

1539
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
A person who was the coordinator

1540
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
was looking for volunteers desperately

1541
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
because they needed people to put the drugs

1542
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
into what was called Medicare.gov plan finder

1543
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and find out what Part D plan would work for them

1544
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
and as retired from pharmacy.

1545
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
So I've been better than ever since.

1546
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I was Shiba Lite for a couple of years

1547
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and then full.

1548
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I think I'm the Senior One in Ben County.

1549
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Now, I believe.

1550
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Anyway,

1551
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
we are, of course,

1552
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
go through training.

1553
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
We have to be recertified every year.

1554
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
We go through a background check,

1555
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
which includes fingerprinting.

1556
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Obviously, we've signed all the confidentiality agreements.

1557
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
We log every contact.

1558
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
It goes into a,

1559
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
obviously, a secure database

1560
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
and our password changes every two months.

1561
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I also am one of the instructors.

1562
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
We either call it new to Medicare

1563
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
or ABCDs of Medicare,

1564
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D.

1565
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
It's like a...

1566
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And that's a two-hour free course.

1567
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Most of them are taught over here at the Benton Center

1568
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
because they have the parking

1569
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
and they have the classroom

1570
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
with computer facilities.

1571
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And I'm currently on phone duty now.

1572
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Oh, I should explain.

1573
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
If you have a Medicare question

1574
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
or you want to talk to a counselor,

1575
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
there's two ways of doing it.

1576
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
One is to call the toll-free number

1577
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
and say them,

1578
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
which you can get off of the web,

1579
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
or to get Shiba in.

1580
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And we can take it right there.

1581
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
And you punch in your zip code

1582
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
and it automatically is referred then to Albany.

1583
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
We, our sponsor here is RSVP,

1584
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Retire Senior Volunteer Program.

1585
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And the sponsors for the different Shiba slash ships,

1586
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
very important,

1587
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
it's not known to County Department of Health,

1588
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I guess, is their sponsor.

1589
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And I can't tell you who the sponsors are

1590
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
and other counties.

1591
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Lynn and Benton and Lincoln are together.

1592
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But anyway,

1593
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
you'll go into the RSVP office

1594
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
at the Consulate Government's Office

1595
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
on Queens Avenue over there in Albany.

1596
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And then an email will go out to the appropriate county

1597
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
with referral.

1598
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And I'm on phone duty.

1599
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And the main reason for that is,

1600
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
as I can't verify,

1601
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
may have mentioned,

1602
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
when you came in.

1603
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
My wife is on foster home,

1604
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
and she's actually under hospice,

1605
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
so I go up three times a day

1606
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and feed her,

1607
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
excuse me,

1608
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
and I can't get up to the senior center.

1609
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So I get the referrals

1610
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
and so forth.

1611
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Which is kind of interesting.

1612
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I kind of like that.

1613
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I enjoy it.

1614
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Almost better than,

1615
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I don't mean anti-face to face,

1616
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
but you can,

1617
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
you can get quite a bit of information

1618
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
over the phone.

1619
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And we have,

1620
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
we have Google Calendar

1621
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
to make appointments I can even make an appointment for them.

1622
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It's just a seemingly complicated subject

1623
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
to be dealing with.

1624
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
One of the things we mentioned in our classes,

1625
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
and we'll tell clients

1626
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
when they almost are feeling sheepish.

1627
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
When you, we worked,

1628
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and you had employer health insurance,

1629
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
you took the employer plan.

1630
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
That was it.

1631
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I mean, you might have had a choice

1632
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
to do in a high deductible,

1633
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
but basically that was it, folks.

1634
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And they may or may not have had dependency coverage.

1635
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Okay, now you're reaching 65.

1636
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
What are you going to do?

1637
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Are you going to keep working?

1638
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Or as your company or your employer says,

1639
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
fine.

1640
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
If then are you going to draw social security or not?

1641
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
And a lot of people think,

1642
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
well, if I don't draw social security,

1643
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I don't go into Medicare.

1644
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And no, wrong.

1645
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
At age 65, you have got to enroll in Medicare,

1646
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
or you're going to get penalized.

1647
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And the penalties can be significant, by the way.

1648
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Unless you happen to be an employer group health plan

1649
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
of 20 or more employees.

1650
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,000
At which case, you can delay it.

1651
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
So Medicare has been described as yes,

1652
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
no, and with the following exceptions.

1653
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But it is universal health care single payer

1654
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:35,000
for the over 65 and over, and for disabled.

1655
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It interfaces with private insurance

1656
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
to pick up deductibles and co-insurance.

1657
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And this is where a lot of people then,

1658
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
should I go with a Medicare supplement,

1659
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
known as a Medicare, or should I go with an advantage plan?

1660
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And if I decide to go with an advantage plan,

1661
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
which one should I go with?

1662
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
If I decide to go with a Medicare, which one should I go with?

1663
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
So there are these various.

1664
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And then there's the fall open enrollment period,

1665
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
where people can change plans.

1666
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And now with the Affordable Care Act,

1667
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
the Medicare crowd also start making appointments

1668
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
because they see all this publicity on the Affordable Care Act.

1669
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
They want to know how this affects them.

1670
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
It doesn't.

1671
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Well, it does.

1672
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
But there's nothing they can do about it.

1673
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Well, the effect is basically beneficial.

1674
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The donut hole will slowly disappear in in the Part D.

1675
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So there's a clue I need for people like you.

1676
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So help people navigate.

1677
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, it keeps us mentally alert, orally straight.

1678
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Well, I'll just take a couple more questions for you.

1679
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
The new building in Portland just opened up.

1680
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I haven't seen it, but they say it's very nice.

1681
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
And I said, the other tower,

1682
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
then it's beautiful view of the river.

1683
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
They could even watch the barges being watched.

1684
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
You know that.

1685
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But I have not seen the new one,

1686
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
other than dry by it.

1687
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So it's going up.

1688
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
It strikes me as being another important chapter,

1689
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I guess, in the history of pharmacy.

1690
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I think they work very, they being the current Dean

1691
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
and the previous Dean.

1692
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Worked very hard to make sure we had the floor space

1693
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and the labs, and so forth,

1694
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
to be a fully not move us there,

1695
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
but to make sure that the faculty there had resources

1696
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
and are to advance.

1697
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
A number of them are hired as clinical assistant,

1698
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
clinical associate professors.

1699
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
That's a non-tenure track type of deal with revolving,

1700
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
fixed term type of thing.

1701
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But they're a tenure track faculty up there too.

1702
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
The last thing I want to ask you about

1703
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
is that the university has changed so much

1704
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
in the last few years,

1705
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and continues to change and grow.

1706
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
That's a good year.

1707
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Perspective on where I always see his heading right now.

1708
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Well,

1709
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I have the impression that we want to be

1710
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
the strongest university in the state,

1711
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
which I have no problem with.

1712
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
We are, of course, in every county.

1713
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I think our relationship with the state is quite good.

1714
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:19,000
The amount of extramural funding that we bring in is phenomenal.

1715
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It's not just NIH, I mean there's ag,

1716
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
there's sea grant, all that type of thing.

1717
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I think the question that OSU has to really wrestle with

1718
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
as do any research university

1719
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
is

1720
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
making sure that the undergraduate still has a good education experience,

1721
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
which at a good research university they can.

1722
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
You have good students

1723
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and you can get them involved in the searching out at new knowledge.

1724
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
It can be a fabulous, fabulous experience.

1725
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
But the faculty

1726
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
have to want to enjoy working with undergraduates.

1727
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Not just their graduate students and their postdocs.

1728
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And for that young assistant professor,

1729
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
that can be,

1730
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
that can be a time-telling, that can be a strain.

1731
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Because it's hard to get the funding.

1732
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I mean, back in the days when the funding was more plentiful,

1733
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
it probably wasn't, but I mean they are struggling to bring that money in.

1734
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And they're hired now with fairly generous start-up packages

1735
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
and they return the university wants them to produce.

1736
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It might almost pay it back.

1737
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So it's a rough go.

1738
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And I have to be very candid

1739
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
and say,

1740
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
would I today start out

1741
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
the same way?

1742
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I think pharmacy was fine.

1743
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
And with the clinical pharmacy and so forth,

1744
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I might find it

1745
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
more,

1746
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I'm more interesting.

1747
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Many more instincts, the wrong word.

1748
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:09,000
But I don't know if I would like to be under that constant gun of getting funded

1749
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and get it renewed.

1750
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I still think that's my temperament.

1751
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I felt very fortunate that Dick O'Bullock took me under his wing there

1752
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
and said, why didn't you?

1753
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I think he saw it was going to fill in big bucks.

1754
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Why, if you look at the regulatory.

1755
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And I think I was successful there.

1756
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Well, Dr. Bock, thank you very much.

1757
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This has been very educational for me.

1758
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And I appreciate you giving us this time to share your memories of pharmacy.

1759
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Well, thank you for coming.

1760
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
And whatever I said, I'll be dying.

1761
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
All right, thanks.
