1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right Ralph, if you would please introduce yourself with your name in today's date in our location.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Okay, Ralph Coleman, also Ralph Coleman, Jr. dates July 8th and we're in my long-time residence in East

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Northern neighborhood in Portland and we're going to discuss O H C E and 3 H State and so on.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes, talk about your father and your association with the University of Mac Corvals as well.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's start with your dad. Can you give us a little background on his upbringing, where he was born and where he was raised?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, he was born and raised in Canby which is a suburb of Portland, South and basically a farming community.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He had a small family, he had a younger brother, two year younger brother.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
His father, P L or Philip Coleman, had come west from Ohio and probably before the turn of the century.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it was an educator and it was the superintendent of the schools there in Canby.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's where my dad grew up when the Canby High School graduated and I think they're very first graduating class in 1914.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And it's not entirely clear what year he was born.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, I've pretty clear it's 1896. There's an affidavit from his aunt who raised him and stating the birth date and so on.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But back in 1896, there were no birth certificates. So the records were either kept in a family Bible or written down some plays.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But he turned up on the 1900 census somehow as having been born in 1895.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So he could use that. If he wanted to be a year older, he'd use the 1895 date.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If he wanted to be a year younger, he'd use 1896.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And his mother died when he was about four or five years old.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And there were the family that my grandfather had married him to sort of took the boys on and raised them.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And his primary character was his aunt Ella in Canby.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It sounds like athletics were important to him from early age.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, I would seem so.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In that era, I don't know if they played football or anything like that.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes, they had a baseball team. There's a picture in these archives of him in his uniform and with his team.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And played baseball for the local team. Herde's arm or shoulder or something.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And was not expected to ever play baseball again.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So he made the decision to go to Organizer Cultural College in 1914. Do you know why he made that decision?

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I mean, he never talked about it. He's probably closer than the U of O.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The decision to go to college period.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The decision to go. I don't know if that's interesting. His brother never went.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And his dad had been to college, but it wasn't a tradition.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You know, the family, none of his extended family in the Canby area, I don't think it ever meant to college.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I don't know what motivated him to do this, just the smart, you know, ambitious kid.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
People liked him when he took off.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He made it in dairy husbandry.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, he'd grown up in the farm community and on the farm.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So this was a natural thing for him.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And there's pictures of him on campus with his hat tied, judging a cow or something like that.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So he came out with a degree in dairy husbandry in 1918 and was immediately drafted into the army in the World War I.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And went to Fort Lewis, now Camp Lewis, the time for Lewis.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Infantry, basic, you know, the meat grinder route. The war was climaxing in 1918.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And the big offensive were going on, so he needed a lot of people.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And he was infantry basic, applied for OCS officers candidate school, accepted into that.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And that prolonged stay just long enough for the war to end before they left.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But he was commissioned a second lieutenant and the machine gun battalion or something like that.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And Matties do avoid the war at the major party.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did he ever talk about his academic experience as a student?

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, I don't remember any great, you know, long comments about that.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was primarily an agricultural school, had a technical component to it.

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The agriculture was the main thrust.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know. That's a good question. I don't know what it didn't hear that much about the coursework.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, we normally associate him with baseball, but it sounds like he perhaps his greater talent was in track and field.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's true, it was. He even talked about this. He went through it. He's never run it all.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He never competed, never been in a race, never did anything.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And somehow got acquainted with some people on the track team, the cross-country team.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And they said, come on, run with us. And he ran them into the ground basically.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It was a natural. And so they said, okay, you're a come out track, you know.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And he had developed into quite a respectable distance man.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
His best time in the mile was in about 420.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I think my son was looking up the world's record of the time was about 415 or 14 or something like that.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So this was a very respectable level of achievement.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And there would have been an Olympics in 1918 that he probably would have, you know, tried for the American team.

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And probably better, pretty good shot at it. Of course the water caused that to be canceled.

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So that was the end of that. But no track was his major athletic activity at Oregon State.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He was captain of the track team, competed in the long zone and all that sort of thing.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So yeah, that was his first athletic activity.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Did he ever express any regret that he couldn't have tried to be on the Olympic team?

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, maybe in passing. But, you know, that's the way it goes.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We all have good shoe to wood ifs, you know.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We only played baseball for one year at Oregon State, OEC.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, I think that's correct. He was playing. He told me he was playing intramural baseball.

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know, not the varsity of the intramural. And that arm felt good.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, his injured shoulder apparently had healed up in the intervening years.

73
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And the coach saw him play or heard about him said, you know, going out and pitch.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So he pitched some games for them in his senior year. And it was pretty effective.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't think they played more than 20 games, you know, a season.

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And then later on, he was good enough to play professionally for three or four summers after we got out of college

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
for the Portland beaters, which at the time was a triple A club.

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And good success, good enough to be looked at by majors.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
At that time, a team like Portland would own the players outright.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the major leagues would buy the players from the teams they wanted.

81
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They would buy them from the team. That's how the team made money. He was selling the players and the majors.

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So he was looked at by Detroit, I think.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And they wouldn't have been in Oregon State. He was on the staff by that time.

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think he turned away from that.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
More secure position at OEC and professional baseball at that time.

86
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
More secure position. More secure position. Yeah.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The baseball, those days, you paid nothing. Prears were short. You know, there were no pensions.

88
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You don't know anything. You just played for a while and then you were going on and that was it.

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So he figured he was pretty well positioned where he was and stayed on.

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He got married, getting by that time too.

91
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tell me about the Osolito club.

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, I don't know very much about it. Just heard the name.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think that was the closest I can think it might have been kind of a eating club.

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You know, they live there. What they call co-ops might have been a co-op.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And sort of a semi fraternity. And that morphed into the Gamma Talk Beta.

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, I think he was still an undergraduate when that came about.

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And then the Gamma Talk Beta, the next day of course, became Delby Upsalon in 1922.

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And that was a big part of his, you know, association with the regular state.

99
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, through his living situation, he encountered a couple of few pretty extraordinary people.

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He mentioned his best friends were Speck Keen and Douglas McKay.

101
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, they were close.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And Speck was from Salem.

103
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And he was a good athlete, a student buddy president.

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And they became good friends. He was the best man at my day as a wedding.

105
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And they were, their family and our family were lifelong friends.

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They saw a lot of each other. Speck was always around.

107
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And he became athletic directors, you know, at a regular state, very close ties.

108
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
In fact, his daughter lives in Krivala. She'd be a good person to contact sometime.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If she'd be willing to, you know, provide information for him.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Doug McKay, I think he might have been a little older than my dad maybe a year or so.

111
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Of course, he would often become governor and secretary of the interior and under eyes now.

112
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, any other recollections of Speck Keen and Douglas McKay?

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or stories about your father's association with them?

114
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, Speck was just a marvelous person.

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And loved fishing and hunting.

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And was just all around a good administrator and a good guy.

117
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And they did a lot of fishing and hunting together.

118
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Every summer, for a number of years, we all go to Nesquan.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you familiar with Nesquan? It doesn't look any different.

120
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know, today, I did that for a couple of weeks.

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And we, you know, eight or ten families from the Oregon State and from Salem and various places.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And that was our summer outing that was Nesquan.

123
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Some of the houses we stayed in in the mid-30s are still there looking just exactly like they did back then.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So, there was a lot of interaction, you know, a lot of closeness in the time.

125
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Maybe people still do that, I don't know.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How did Ralph meet his wife?

127
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't know. She was a student at Oregon State, a tri-delt.

128
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
She'd grown up in Colberg and went to the University of Oregon for a while.

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And then transferred to Oregon State, I'm not sure why.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
She was about three years younger than I did.

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And it was a very come-we young woman, a series of pictures of her after a while, as well.

132
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And so, you know, I don't know the details.

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They dated and got married in their, in her parents' house in Eugene, I think it was.

134
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Later on, they first lived with us in Corbalas, a little better part of their lives.

135
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And a very nice, extended family situation.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Did he talk any more about other social activities or more about fraternity life than his school years?

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, he'd tell the usual pacing stories and things like that.

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It didn't sound all that much different from my own experience, you know, 40 years later.

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But it was, I think Oregon State was a fun place, I don't think they took life all that seriously.

140
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But we see in those years, it was an ag school primarily with a big military complement.

141
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Engineering was certainly on the picture, but I think it was mostly a local people.

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Local kids went there.

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Did he mention his ROTC experience?

144
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, he thought that was great. He loved ROTC. He was good at it.

145
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He had a lot of kind of a command, presence, and just resonated with his mentality, I guess.

146
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And the ROTC, I think, was what got him in OCS.

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I may have saved his funds if they were at Fort Lewis campus.

148
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, I mentioned that the World War I experience kind of came and went.

149
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In 1919, he returned to Corvallis.

150
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Got out of the military in that fall.

151
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The war ended in November. I think he got out probably in maybe later on in the year.

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Anyway, he went to boot back to Corvallis and was hired by the Corvallis schools in their intramural,

153
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
or their PE athletic aspect of coaching and things like that.

154
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And, you know, it was no background, whatever, and education.

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I think he did that for a year then was hired put on the staff at Oregon State

156
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in the physical education department.

157
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And they kind of tasked with developing intramural programs and expanding that into those facilities

158
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and activities available to the whole student body.

159
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He did that pretty much the rest of his career.

160
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He was head of intermeds and numerals, head of meds, physical education.

161
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So he was in the PE department in 1919 and was there until 1966.

162
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So he found a home.

163
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, intramurals are pretty extensive these days at OSU.

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's kind of like, intramurals are very extensive at OSU these days.

165
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And apparently, we had a rough one to thank for.

166
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, he got them started. He didn't finish it.

167
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But that was what he, that was his original.

168
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
In fact, there's a little side for you.

169
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You know where the tennis courts are.

170
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And it would be west of, it would be just north of the football facilities and all that.

171
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That was the original Coleman field.

172
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Really?

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It was the inner mural field.

175
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That was the original.

176
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know if it was ever formally, you know, just called that.

177
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And then when he, you know, went to the coaching and then he was there forever,

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
then that became Coleman field.

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No, no.

180
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Interesting.

181
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
A little side there that's kind of fun.

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He lived at the Gamma Talbayda House during this time.

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

184
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I know a little about that.

185
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But like I say, during the while he came back after the war.

186
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And he re-associated with the fraternity.

187
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In fact, lived there.

188
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And he didn't, wasn't in college or anything, but he just moved in.

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And that's when they assigned him this promising, but kind of socially awkward depression,

190
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
minus calling.

191
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And my dad wasn't at school, but he was, you know, supposed to look out for a minus and socializing and, you know,

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
getting going in school.

193
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And that's when he reported that to the house that he didn't think this guy isn't going to make it every state.

194
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Never studies.

195
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
All he does is repulp Westerns and sleeps a lot.

196
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So he totally missed the mark on that one.

197
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The line was so easy for Pauling that he didn't have to exert himself at all.

198
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And as you know, he was coaching or teaching undergraduate chemistry, I think,

199
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
by the time he was a sophomore or junior.

200
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So he, and it was a good guy, I guess, you know, a popular guy.

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And one of the guys, and you know, think of two-time Nobel Prize winners as one of the guys normally.

202
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think he always cherished that relationship, you know, because he was shy and sort of, you know,

203
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
a misfit when you're that smart and that, you know, that level of achievement.

204
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I think it's, you do, I think, find yourself kind of on the outside.

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So to whatever extent is true, I think the Gamma taught me is socialized him.

206
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And would you like me to expand on that a little bit?

207
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Absolutely.

208
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

209
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I met Linus a few times.

210
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We weren't close friends or anything like that.

211
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But he never forgot to ring a state.

212
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And in the Gamma taught beta, it became Delta Upsilon in my team,

213
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
22 National Opportunity.

214
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And Linus Paul Lang and my dad and a number of other people were chartered members.

215
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And there's pictures somewhere in the cell of this group, you know.

216
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And his, in 1966, it would have been the, that was a 40-year, 60s, yeah.

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I was later in that.

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, it's in my documentation or somewhere.

219
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They had a reunion or an anniversary.

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It might have been the 50th, maybe the 60th, I don't know.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Anniversary of the founding of the fraternity.

222
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And, you know, all the alums in the Portland area and so on were there.

223
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And they rounded up as many of the chartered members as they could find.

224
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And there were about eight or ten of them, something like that.

225
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Linus is one, and my dad is one.

226
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And each one of them took their turn at the mic and told stories, you know,

227
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
about their experiences at the Bedouin State.

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Linus was particularly funny because when they were applying to the national fraternity,

229
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
they had to list the achievements and attributes and all the potential members.

230
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And they wanted to have, you know, some athletic experiences for everybody.

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You know, he played this and he did that.

232
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Linus had no athletic background, whatever.

233
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So my dad was assigned the chore of teaching him to run hurdles.

234
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So they could claim he was a track man.

235
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And Linus described, you know, in a very funny way, he and my dad,

236
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
bounding around the track, you know, or Dr. Alice jumping over, over hurdles.

237
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So they could claim to be a hurdle.

238
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So he had a, Linus had a good sense of humor.

239
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And he told some interesting stories.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He told about, he talked for about 45 minutes, just unscripted.

241
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And I just, I'd give anything you had a recording of that,

242
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
because he talked about his, his experiences with passports and beaches.

243
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And he was on his way to Stockholm to get one of his Nobel prizes.

244
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And they landed in Oslo.

245
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And nobody met him.

246
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Nobody from the embassy came to greet the plane or anything.

247
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He was, you know, not a good repute at the time.

248
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And so he went on to Stockholm on his own.

249
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And then he, he was also given the prize he got from, the award he got from Russia.

250
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The Lennon Peace Prize.

251
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Lennon Peace Prize.

252
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay.

253
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And so he had been awarded the Lennon Peace Prize and was, you know, requested to go to Russia

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and receiving, he couldn't get a visa.

255
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And he just couldn't get permission from Russia to enter Russia.

256
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And here he is going to get the Lennon Peace Prize.

257
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They wouldn't let him in the country.

258
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So he contacted one of his science colleagues in Russia and said, you know,

259
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
what the hell's going on here?

260
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll come, I can't, I can't, come.

261
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They won't let me come.

262
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So the guy said, I'll look into it and he got back to me.

263
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He said, well, I got two the Linus Pauling files.

264
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
One is Linus Pauling, you know, peace, loving, advocate, the world peace.

266
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And so on the other is Linus Pauling, capitalist running dog.

267
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This one, somehow the application got in the comments of the capitalist running dog file.

268
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So they wouldn't grant it.

269
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They got it straightened out.

270
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But I thought it was, you know, it's kind of a typical Cold War snafu.

271
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They weren't, they weren't on the same page anymore.

272
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The rest of us were.

273
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So anyway, he got there and got the Lennon Prize.

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And of course, this was a controversial event.

275
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You know, when was that the 60s?

276
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, 60s or 70s, maybe.

277
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

278
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And that didn't go down well.

279
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And because he was being criticized for, you know, his nuclear test band proposals and atmospheric testing and so on.

280
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So he was, he was controversial enough that it was.

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I was a student at the U of O as a grad student later.

282
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He came through on some kind of a speaking thing.

283
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And it was controversial, sort of, in the 60s, the 50s or the late 50s.

284
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
In fact, he was a little side story.

285
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's kind of interesting, you know, my fraternity.

286
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There was a picture of Linus hanging in the Dan.

287
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And, you know, for other dignitaries.

288
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And this would have been in the early 50s.

289
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And his picture was taken down by some of the members hidden away somewhere.

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It disappeared because of this, you know, this attack from the right.

291
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And I don't think it phased Linus at all.

292
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think he just plowed it on through, you know, I don't know.

293
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So he, you know, he knew he wanted to do and he did.

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He has, you know, everlasting credit.

295
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And he and your dad maintained a connection over the years.

296
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Right.

297
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He and your dad maintained a connection.

298
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Loose connection.

299
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't think it was ever, you know, there was a history there at early days, which, you know, you don't, you remember those things.

300
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But I don't think there was much, you know, correspondence or much contact.

301
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Because he was, you know, operating in a entirely different, different level.

302
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well, back to your dad in the early days in Corralis.

303
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He coached freshman track for four years, too.

304
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I think that's right.

305
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't have all of that in front of me.

306
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Some of those information I gave you.

307
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think that was probably his first coaching job was, was track.

308
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Did he maintain an interest in track over the years?

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yes, he did.

310
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah, he, he loved, he loved helping with track needs and helping put them on high school track needs.

311
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So he was, yeah, that was his first athletic well, I think.

312
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He's also an outstanding golfer.

313
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah.

314
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We became the head baseball coach in there in the 1920s, but it was a different situation back then that is now.

315
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
How do you mean?

316
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, he's essentially a volunteer job for one.

317
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh, right, right, right.

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm not sure it was a paid job.

319
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think he often, often said that it was not, he was paid, you know, to be an administrator, a teacher and the physical education department.

320
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And an academic appointment there.

321
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So baseball was just sort of an aside.

322
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It wasn't a very, I don't think high-powered program.

323
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
There's photos in this thing that show the baseball field in 1920.

324
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There isn't even a backstop.

325
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You know, Waldo Hall is there and you see the building and the heating plant with the chimney and all that.

326
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But nothing else is around there.

327
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So it was a very, you know, low-key operation.

328
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And he didn't want to be paid for it largely because he said that then there'd be an expectation.

329
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
He didn't want that.

330
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He wanted to be able to do this as a, as a hobby, you know, as a fun thing.

331
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And it was and got him a lot of notoriety, you know, made him a lot of friends and a lot of fun for him.

332
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But he didn't want the, they eventually didn't start paying him, you know, years later.

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But it was not a big, a big amount of money for him.

334
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That wasn't his job.

335
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That wasn't how he made his living.

336
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And I always thought that was kind of shrewd.

337
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You know, coaches get fired because they don't perform.

338
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And he didn't want that.

339
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You know, get, find somebody, if you get somebody for the price you're getting me for, go for it.

340
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But he didn't coach non-stop from 1922 on.

341
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He ever several periods there when he was head of other administrators.

342
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Do these in the 30s, Slats Guild coach, I think, for about six years.

343
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah, that was fascinating.

344
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Discovery Slats Guild, also baseball catch.

345
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

346
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But it was a very low key sport.

347
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Like I say, 20 games, maybe, if they were lucky.

348
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And they just played local teams.

349
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Was there any recruiting at all?

350
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Well, I don't know.

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Or my dad recruited.

352
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He would recruit locally and scout around high school kids in the summer and that sort of thing.

353
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So, nothing like, nothing like today.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's light years removed from, you know.

355
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Are there any scholarships offered back there?

356
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I think, by the time I got there in the 50s, I think there were some scholarships.

357
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
They'd have a handful.

358
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
They'd split it up into little pieces.

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Most, I think, you had to work for them in those days.

360
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
If you were getting a stipend ride, they'd call it a year.

361
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You had to put in a certain number of hours, you know, cutting grass or doing something.

362
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And, you know, they made us, we had to do that.

363
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Well, tell me about how his coaching career evolved over time.

364
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I mean, the baseball became more formal and he became more established and the program became more established.

365
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, it was just an evolution.

366
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't know if they were long-time rivalries or some great pictures of one.

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
There was a picture in there of Buck Bailey kicking the bucket, you know, and the water's spraying out.

368
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And so there were, or again, lots of good rivalries there.

369
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And people liked the game.

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But it just developed and got, you know, their vision was there.

371
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And then eventually in the 50s, late 40s, they formed a Southern division.

372
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The California schools rise there.

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We didn't play them.

374
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And then in that era, they started to play postseason games.

375
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And the college world series came along in 1946 or 1947, something like that.

376
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The George W. Bush was captain of the first Harvard team.

377
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I think they won the college world series.

378
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It was the first baseball.

379
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
George H. W. Bush.

380
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The first, first Bush.

381
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
H. W. Yeah, not W. H. W.

382
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Right.

383
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So, college baseball got a big shot in the arm when that national competition started.

384
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And they had good years and bad.

385
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And it was a lot of fun.

386
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
At any point did he feel like that he was baseball coach, was his job

387
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and the other job was less of his job?

388
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Well, yeah.

389
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't think so.

390
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You always pay attention to where you're, who signs the check.

391
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But baseball was what, you know, got his reputation and his social thing.

392
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You know, his players loved him.

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And everybody knew who he was.

394
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And he's a very personable guy.

395
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And people responded to him and liked him.

396
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And so that makes life easy.

397
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's only more about his personality.

398
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He was an intense competitor.

399
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He said, oh, yes.

400
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He just, on the bench, he was just a constant motion.

402
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You know, throwing grass in the air and stomping up and down.

403
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And attacking the young players and challenging calls.

404
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You don't see that anymore at all.

405
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But all the coaches used to do it back, you know, in the 40s and 50s and 60s.

406
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But after the game was over, no problem.

407
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Everything was fine.

408
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But I think that was, I always thought that was kind of a negative.

409
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I mean, your coach is just constantly, you know, spinning out of control practically.

410
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And your sports remain calm.

411
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You know, in any control.

412
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But you know, his intensity was infectious and a question about it.

413
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And what do you want to win, too?

414
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Well, obviously Corvallis is in a rainy place.

415
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And baseball is played during the spring when it's often rainy.

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But do you never, did he have a facilities component to his job, too?

417
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm sorry, taking care of the field, obviously.

418
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Well, the players did most of that.

419
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They were on a scholarship or a ride.

420
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then we did a lot of that.

421
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So you can imagine what kind of shape the baseball field was in.

422
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We used the armory for our spring workouts and things.

423
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The season didn't start.

424
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We didn't play any games until the start of spring quarter.

425
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Now they play 60 or 70 games a year now.

426
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And we were lucky if we played 25 or 30.

427
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It was fine with me.

428
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's good to get the season over.

429
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You want to do other things.

430
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
What was travel like back then?

431
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
No buses, cars.

432
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We took my senior here, I guess it was.

433
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
We took our first out of state trip.

434
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
A spring break.

435
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's a week in there.

436
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So my dad is scheduled to several games in California.

437
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So we piloted in these cars and took off for California

438
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and played Stanford, Cal and Sacramento and Fresno.

439
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And we didn't have any budget at all.

440
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This was the first out of state trip, you know,

441
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
except for the conference play.

442
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
First, you know, they do this routinely.

443
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Now they go all over the country playing in tournaments.

444
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And this was an interesting experience.

445
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I think it would have been 1953 probably.

446
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And we'd pull into some town like Berkeley,

447
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
where we would play Cal.

448
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And my dad would say, okay,

449
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
the game would be at the field tomorrow at noon.

450
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Games at 2.30 or something.

451
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Be there at noon.

452
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
See ya.

453
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We were on our own.

454
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We didn't have a hotel.

455
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We didn't have anything.

456
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I think we had some meal money.

457
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I think you might have given us some meal money.

458
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And we were supposed to fend for ourselves

459
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that we did by staying in fraternities.

460
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You know, you know, I fall in and call it the U House

461
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and say, you know, I'm down here with the Oregon State baseball team.

462
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And we come and camp there for a couple of days.

463
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Oh sure.

464
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And the guys have worn in fraternities.

465
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We just bring them along.

466
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Pretend like they were.

467
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So that's how we got by.

468
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
In Fresno, we finally stayed in the hotel

469
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
because I think he wanted to know where everybody was

470
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
when they came time to go home.

471
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But other than that, we were just,

472
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
just freelancing it.

473
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's funny.

474
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I can compare that to the day that everything,

475
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
but they're private jet, you know.

476
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
How did they, how did the colon feel itself?

477
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It wasn't called colon feel them.

478
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And how did it change over time?

479
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Well, I think you just got just fell into the usage, you know.

480
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Before it was dedicated, you know, formally dedicated.

481
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah.

482
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Just, did he have to raise some funds?

483
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Do you recall to have improvements made?

484
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Or I don't recall anything like that.

485
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I think it was just based on what the,

486
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what the athletic department would provide.

487
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Actually, they put a backstop up.

488
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They put a backstop up.

489
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We had seats, bleachers, and all that kind of thing.

490
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But it was, it was pretty primitive.

491
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There was no fence out in the outfield.

492
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh, really?

493
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
No.

494
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And the ground was hard.

495
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And while it got past the outfielders, it was all run.

496
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But you couldn't get one out of the park.

497
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They were all inside the park.

498
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

499
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So that was made an interesting, you know,

500
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
addition to the, to the challenges.

501
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So you wanted fast outfielders.

502
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah.

503
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You mentioned that training was pretty casual.

504
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah.

505
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, there really wasn't any.

506
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You know, we just started, we'd work out the gym or the armory

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and I'd have stress running because that was especially for pitchers

508
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
because that was, you know, good for you.

509
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But no, you know, half the team probably smoked, including my dad.

510
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And that was just, you know, we'd take smoke breaks during the game

511
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
under the stands.

512
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I love the buses and things like that.

513
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So a little more casual.

514
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah.

515
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And this is both teams would join for the smoke break, right?

516
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, yeah.

517
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I guess I hadn't thought of that.

518
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But we were on the first base side in those days.

519
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And now they're on the third base side.

520
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And down up the south end of the field,

521
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
they had the wooden football stadium stands that went around there.

522
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't know if you picked them up.

523
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
There was, we'd go down under there and the stands and, you know,

524
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
be out of the other side.

525
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Was this, was this scheduled before the game,

526
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
or was there some signal when I thought it was time for a smoke break?

527
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I thought it was just, let's go.

528
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
In between getting, you know.

529
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, his most successful team was probably in 1952.

530
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The team won the PCC championship in the State of Western Regional

531
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and went to the Colossal World Series in Omaha.

532
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You were a member of the squad anyway.

533
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Right.

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I was a member of the squad.

535
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It was actually, I was JVing at that year.

536
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Didn't play, you know, a play against the varsity

537
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and with them and practice, practice and things like that.

538
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
No, I didn't actually play with the team.

539
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And the numbers that they took back to Omaha,

540
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think they were restricted.

541
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So again, it was a fairly small squad.

542
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
There were players that played, you know,

543
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
the longest part of the season that didn't go back.

544
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They got hammered.

545
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
They lost the first two games.

546
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It was hot and so on.

547
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
They got there, that was amazing.

548
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They didn't make it back for another, like, 30 years or 35 years

549
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
or something like that.

550
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well, do you remember much about that season?

551
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I mean, it sounds like it was sort of a magical season.

552
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
They just came together and some really good athletes.

553
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Those days, it was very common for guys

554
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to play more than one sport.

555
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And let me see.

556
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Our catcher was a starting-end football team.

557
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
First baseman was a starting forward.

558
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Second baseman was a starting guard, the basketball team.

559
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The third baseman was a linebacker, football linebacker.

560
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Left fielder was another tight-end.

561
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And so I think out of, if you take away the pitchers,

562
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I think there were three starters on that team

563
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
that didn't start for some other team.

564
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So without those guys, we would be helpless, you know.

565
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So yeah, you could play and they loved baseball

566
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
because I got them out of spring football and that sort of thing.

567
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So they all wanted to play baseball.

568
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And it was a fun sport.

569
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
What do you remember hearing about the Omaha trip?

570
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Obviously didn't go all the field, but it was...

571
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Well, I think they went by train.

572
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Well, I'm training the very hot while they were there.

573
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Omaha, you know, at the time of year, it could be pretty bad.

574
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And I don't think their accommodations were very good.

575
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I think it was only about the 50 or 60-year of the college

576
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
middle series.

577
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So I don't think they'd really gotten their rhythm down yet.

578
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And I remember them talking about the heat.

579
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
They couldn't sleep.

580
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We had these heavy wool uniforms.

581
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Just one uniform.

582
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You want something warm as you played out here.

583
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But back there, it was totally inappropriate.

584
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I think that hurt them.

585
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you remember being a big deal with that?

586
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Made the World Series on campus?

587
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Oh, yeah.

588
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We played the U.S.C.

589
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Southern Cal, we were the perennial champions.

590
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And we played them in Crivales.

591
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We played them in Los Angeles the year before.

592
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They beat us down there.

593
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And we got them again in Crivales in 52.

594
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I think we had 5,000 people there.

595
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
They put the stands up, you know,

596
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
dragged them in from all over.

597
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And huge crowd.

598
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It was a big deal.

599
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah.

600
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That must have meant something else.

601
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It was.

602
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It was.

603
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It was a great fight.

604
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
A couple of no-worldly players that I came across.

605
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Maybe you can comment on.

606
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Do you know much about Wes Schoenrich?

607
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah.

608
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I knew Wes.

609
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
He was lived over in the coast.

610
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I think over on the Ness Tucka.

611
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And it was a fishing guide and an outdoor type of guy.

612
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And he'd come to all the games.

613
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Big burly.

614
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You know, oysters.

615
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Guy.

616
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And it was also a great football player.

617
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't know if he played in the pros or not.

618
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But he was.

619
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
He did play pro baseball.

620
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
He did play major league baseball.

621
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
For the Philly sand.

622
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Another name I came across was Ed Coleman.

623
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Ed Coleman, right?

624
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah.

625
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
His half brother.

626
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
He was several years younger.

627
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And played for the Oregon State.

628
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And really good career in the majors.

629
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He played about five or six years.

630
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And he played for the Portland Beavers after that.

631
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He had a good career.

632
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
He was in the record books for a while.

633
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
He was a great pinch hitter.

634
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
He was a American league pinch hit.

635
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
He was a single season pinch hit record for about 30 years or something.

636
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So he had good success.

637
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Athletic family.

638
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

639
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Did you have a particular style as a coach?

640
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And any sort of philosophy of baseball?

641
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I mean, would Pat Casey his favorite sort of a small ball approach?

642
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Was there anything like that?

643
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Just beat the other guys up.

644
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You know, that 52 team was a good example.

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
He was the guy for huge.

646
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You know, the starting four were just six five.

647
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And the football players were six three, six four.

648
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
For the day, these guys were huge.

649
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It was big pitchers and everything.

650
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Physically.

651
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And we would make sure that when we'd take batting practice before a game,

652
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
that was always pretty game rituals since each team would take batting practice.

653
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You'd watch the other team.

654
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You know, yeah.

655
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And we'd make sure that the bigger the bigger the guys were,

656
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the earlier they got out.

657
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And yeah, so we've dropped these great big guys out, you know.

658
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And they'd be in the ball all over the place.

659
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And it was intimidating, you know.

660
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So yeah, he liked that kind of team.

661
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So he didn't, we didn't play much small ball.

662
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I think the idea was just to, you know, overpower him.

663
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah.

664
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Who were some of your dad's best friends in Corralis?

665
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, he was there for a very long time.

666
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And as you said, he's a popular guy.

667
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The only belong to all the clubs, the Youngst club and the Rotary Club.

668
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And, you know, if there was a club, he'd join it.

669
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And most of the close friends we had.

670
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
There were a lot of them in the department, the Lantons, Dixon's,

671
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
other coaches, Slasvio, you know, we just,

672
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Lonnie, Steiner, the role of close friends, the coaches.

673
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And he had close friends just among the townspeople.

674
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
He was a small town boy and liked a small town association.

675
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What was your impression of Slasvio?

676
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Terrific guy, I like Slas a lot.

677
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I used to caddy for him.

678
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And he'd always give me two bucks.

679
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I think that was it.

680
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So, and he had two kids who were a little younger than me.

681
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But of course, I knew them and everything.

682
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Slas was a really good guy.

683
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
He just, you know, found his niche and stayed in it.

684
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Just, you know, did great.

685
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And they'd be on, they'd be, you know, standard participants in the annual beach trips

686
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and the parties and hunting and fishing.

687
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And they did all this stuff, you know, all the coaches

688
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and people did all these things together.

689
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Now, Slas was a really, really good guy.

690
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I kind of think there was something I was going to say about him,

691
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
but it was, oh, maybe a little anecdote you may not know.

692
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
UCLA was looking for a basketball coach.

693
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And they ended up hiring John Wooden.

694
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But Slas turned it down.

695
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
These teams had beaten them.

696
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
UCLA, two years in a row over the championship.

697
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So, he'd be decided to incrementalist.

698
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't think they'd get offered any kind of money

699
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
but he just decided to stay out and he grew up in Salem.

700
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So, he was a, you know, very much a local boy.

701
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So, Wooden went on to become, you know, a legend.

702
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But Slas preferred the smaller arena.

703
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
How about Lonstiner?

704
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Did you know him at all?

705
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, yeah.

706
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, Lonstiner was just a really nice guy.

707
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
He was lots of fun and we'd go hunting and fishing, you know.

708
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
My dad and Lonnie.

709
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And he just, he liked, he was, you know, when you're a kid,

710
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
you know, when there's people growing up so like you

711
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and others that are just kind of going through the motions, you know.

712
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And Lonnie really liked people, liked kids.

713
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Just the terrific guy.

714
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Well, it sounds like outdoors were important to this group of men.

715
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Were there other hangouts that they frequented besides the lodges?

716
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, Elves Club, primarily that was the place where everybody gathered.

717
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It was right in the center of town at the time.

718
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
They didn't know if the building was still there, but it was right, you know,

719
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
on third street or fourth street.

720
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And so, this was just the focus for all social activities in town.

721
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Get moose and others, but the Elves Club was the one that most people frequented.

722
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
My sense of the athletic department during your dad's time

723
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
is a pretty tight-knit group.

724
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Is that accurate?

725
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You think?

726
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

727
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Paul Blondie, of course, he came in in late thirties, played basketball,

728
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and Navy, and then came back and never left.

729
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He still went, I think, isn't he?

730
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
He's in the ball, still alive.

731
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He was the J.B. baseball coach, was he not?

732
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
He was. He was the freshman.

733
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
He was the only assistant.

734
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
My dad had, and I don't think he got paid,

735
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
but he was the tennis coach, assistant basketball coach,

736
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and assistant baseball coach.

737
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So he was your coach, isn't he?

738
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Right.

739
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
What was he like as a coach?

740
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
A good guy.

741
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You know, baseball hadn't been his game, but it didn't matter.

742
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You know, he could manage it.

743
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I remember we played a game against the...

744
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
as a freshman, they had freshman teams in those days.

745
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You'd only play three years of RC,

746
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
so you played your first year as a freshman.

747
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
We went over and played in the penitentiary.

748
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You know, in Salem.

749
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
They played a whole...

750
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The Zang was that they played a strictly home schedule.

751
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So we were in there, and it was fun.

752
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You know, let us...

753
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'd never been in the penitentiary, and you know,

754
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
the field was out in the corner, it was huge wall.

755
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And the umpire was...

756
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I was pitching the game, actually.

757
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And the umpire was, you know, the convict, and so on.

758
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And they just...

759
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
on each other totally, they'd bother us, you know.

760
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But they were just razzing each other.

761
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Everybody had a nickname.

762
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And so it was a...

763
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it was a fun experience.

764
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I don't know the baseball...

765
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I don't know if the prison grades, I don't know if they still have a baseball team or not.

766
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Your dad was also an official.

767
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
He officiated football and basketball.

768
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yes.

769
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And that was his...

770
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
it was a hobby.

771
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I mean, he made money at it.

772
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And yeah, quite a good reputation.

773
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:57,000
He was a football official with several rose bowls.

774
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And yes, that's why he finally got out of that on the late 30s.

775
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It was two more to physically demand me, you know, the football home of the basketball.

776
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No, he did a lot of money.

777
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
He was a commissioner for referees, for a while, for the conference.

778
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And he would evaluate officials and rate them.

779
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And that was some things that are overseer.

780
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Well, he retired in 1966.

781
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And he mentioned he was a good golfer at...

782
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
he seems to have turned his attention to golf at that time.

783
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Well, he always played golf.

784
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Like, I'll take that back.

785
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
He's...

786
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't know when he started playing golf.

787
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
He helped lay out the Dallas Country Club.

788
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Really?

789
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And it was really good.

790
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And coached your taught golf.

791
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You never coached golf.

792
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You taught golf for years in physical education department or in state.

793
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And played it a lot.

794
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And it was good.

795
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Anything like that came easy to it.

796
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You know, when your athletic attempts to generalize, you know, all the areas.

797
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And do you play golf?

798
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
A little bit.

799
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But you know what a shank is.

800
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, he developed the shanks.

801
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Terminal decays with the shanks.

802
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And he didn't play for about 15 years.

803
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Just walked away from the game totally.

804
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
He was a regular golfer, you know, a couple times a week kind of thing.

805
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And took lessons and tried everything.

806
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And this couldn't get over it.

807
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And then when he retired, he kind of got him back into golf a little bit.

808
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
When he retired, they left Corvalis, my mother, and sold their house and moved to Woodburn,

809
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a senior state.

810
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And he was hired there as the golf to take over the golf program.

811
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So yeah, that was his retirement venue.

812
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah, golf is important to him.

813
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
He liked that game.

814
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The beginning was so competitive that it kind of, you know, you can't be overly good.

815
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You can't try too hard, you know, and go off as a game.

816
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You have to play below your, you know,

817
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
your maximum effort.

818
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah.

819
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And so I think that was kind of made it harder.

820
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Do you know anything more about the laying out the Country Club?

821
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I mean, just didn't that story.

822
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Only that they planted the all those, they planted fur trees.

823
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Layout, of course.

824
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know if it was with them.

825
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The members and the volunteers, the volunteers, they planted all those fur trees in the rough.

826
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And it was only nine holes, you know, begin with.

827
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And very yellowy and clay.

828
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And it's just like concrete, you know, to play it.

829
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So, you know, that was laid out in, probably mid-twenties.

830
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So he was a charter member then.

831
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I think it probably was, yeah, probably pretty close.

832
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Well, Colin Field was dedicated as such in April 1981.

833
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm sure that meant something to him.

834
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Do you have any reason of that particular moment that it had been?

835
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, my son and I went down.

836
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And we're there.

837
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
There's pictures and documentation, you know, in the material that is there.

838
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And Robert McVicker was the president.

839
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And Jack Riley was the coach.

840
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And it was during, I think it was secondary to a game.

841
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I can't remember exactly.

842
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I think it was.

843
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Very nice event.

844
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
The speech, he was a very good presenter.

845
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And could tell jokes.

846
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I think, I don't think there's any record of what he said at that event.

847
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
But there's some other information.

848
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
There's some, he would write it out ahead of time.

849
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So there's some things in there.

850
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
He could, he was good.

851
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Good on his feet.

852
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Do you think I meant the lot to him that the field had been named after him officially?

853
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Oh, I think so.

854
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, we wouldn't.

855
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You know, that was a source of pride, I'm sure.

856
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Nice honor for him.

857
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And after that, it sounds like he got another job in baseball.

858
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
The Portland Mavericks.

859
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Are you familiar with the history of the Portland Mavericks?

860
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
No, okay.

861
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Well, he, being Russell, who was an actor, Western actor,

862
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the Portland Beaver franchise had been kind of left vacant.

863
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
He picked us up for practically nothing.

864
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I think it was partly to provide a venue for Kurt, his son Kurt Russell to play,

865
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
who was quite an active baseball player.

866
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And the Mavericks were independent, the own team.

867
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
They weren't owned by any other major league team or anything like that.

868
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And these were just free agents, some pros, some amateurs,

869
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and being Russell hired somebody to manage the team.

870
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And he would be around and these players up.

871
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And they played and they, it wasn't AAA, it was, I mean,

872
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
a AA level down at the moment, we'll see.

873
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And I think there's a movie being made about, you know,

874
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
books, things like that.

875
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And they were a very flamboyant, you know, bunch.

876
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And when, at one point, Frank Peters didn't need anything.

877
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Okay, he was an Oregon State baseball player,

878
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
basketball player played on that final four basketball team.

879
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And had played professional baseball and he was hired as the manager.

880
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And he hired my dad to be his third base coach,

881
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
because he played for my dad.

882
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And so there's a Mavericks hat around the house somewhere.

883
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So he spent two or three seasons, you know,

884
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
helping manage the four Mavericks.

885
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That was later on, pretty late in his life.

886
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Right, yeah.

887
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Okay, so let's turn the attention to you now.

888
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You were born and raised in Corvallas,

889
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and I just didn't know the Corvallas that you knew growing up as a boy.

890
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Small town, all the way.

891
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Everything just revolved around the campus.

892
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Summer time, everything just quit.

893
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Everybody just handed their yards and laid around.

894
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They didn't have much in the way of summer school.

895
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
They did have a summer school and one of my dad's assignments was to work

896
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
with the summer students and setting up field trips.

897
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
They'd go to, you know, a bodybuild dam in Timberline Mods,

898
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
and over the coast, and he'd organize.

899
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
He just loved this kind of thing, you know.

900
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And so, but it was a nice place to be in the summer,

901
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
or whatever was going on.

902
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And the Corvallas calendar was Oregon State's calendar.

903
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
New Year's Day was when school started in the fall.

904
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It wasn't in January because everything just focused on the activities on campus.

905
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And most everybody worked for the camp college.

906
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
One, you know, directly or indirectly.

907
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It wasn't any excuse for Corvallas being there, but for Oregon State.

908
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And it was a very nice place to grow up.

909
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
The campus was our playground.

910
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
The kids, you know, we just knew how to get into every building.

911
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And we said, you know, we needed to get into.

912
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Our parents didn't know what we were doing.

913
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I don't think they wanted to know what we were doing.

914
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So it was a playground.

915
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
As you got a little bit older and to say,

916
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the high school age, where were the places that the kids congregated?

917
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You mean in Corvallas?

918
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Well, there were some, there were some, there were some drive-ins.

919
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And there was a drive-in theater up between Albany and Corvallas.

920
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It was a fun place to be.

921
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
There were places downtown, restaurants, I don't remember having any particular.

922
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It was kind of like American graffiti.

923
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It was a lot like Corvallas.

924
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It was a lot like the American graffiti, you know, ambiance.

925
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It was a very nice place to go up.

926
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Everybody kind of had their activities, you know,

927
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
everybody's garden, their mothers all collected antiques,

928
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and played bridge, and most of the mothers didn't work.

929
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Faculty wives, there weren't jobs.

930
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
First of all, it wasn't, I don't think it was considered quite

931
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
socially acceptable for mothers to be working.

932
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It was kind of an admission that you needed the money, you know what I mean?

933
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So, there everybody had lots of time.

934
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
There wasn't much, there weren't very many organized activities.

935
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You know, we kids, we just did what we wanted to do,

936
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and say, well, be home for dinner, you know, when that was it.

937
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
What sort of impact do you remember the depression having on the town?

938
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It sounds like the faculty referred a little on some of the economic impact.

939
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, that was my impression.

940
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You know, I didn't, I wasn't hardly aware of the depression.

941
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It was just the way things were.

942
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I was born in 1931, of course, that's just when it was in its worst.

943
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And it didn't affect the university college that met much.

944
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Everybody, I don't think they had much of the way of cutbacks,

945
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I think, although I couldn't document it,

946
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
there were times when they did not get paid at all by the state.

947
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
They were given IOUs, and I think they were honored later on.

948
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
But that was, it was, it kept breathing.

949
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And of course, there were migrants in Crabalus,

950
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and they show up at our back door and want food and that sort of thing.

951
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It was, it was there.

952
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And of course, World War II came along and ended that and I heard...

953
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Well, that's my next question.

954
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
How did this, how did the town respond to World War II?

955
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
What was it like during that period of time?

956
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Well, of course, there were no men around.

957
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And they had a ASTP program.

958
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That didn't need to.

959
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It was an Army-sponsored program for soldiers to go to college,

960
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
and I think they became officers at the end of it.

961
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So there's an ASTP program.

962
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But these are soldiers essentially assigned to that role.

963
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And as far as men went on campus, that was about yet.

964
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:04,719
The women lived in the fraternity houses, and the school kept going, but the war was

965
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:07,840
having a big impact on it.

966
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,000
Was it there in the midst of its growing noise?

967
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:22,679
Yes, the Campadero was had a huge impact on Crabalus and Albany, and it was a basic

968
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:32,760
infantry basic, I think they put four divisions, infantry divisions through there, three or

969
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:39,680
four years, it was right, and that's a lot of soldiers, and we had one living in our

970
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,160
house, we always had one living in our house with us, not what they get back, we didn't

971
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:51,680
have the soldier living there, we had his wife living there in our spare bedroom, and

972
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,400
this was pretty typical, the wives would follow the soldiers out to be around during their

973
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:04,000
basic training, and these guys would get released from Campadero for a weekend or something,

974
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,440
and hear them clump up the stairs at night, GI boots and down the next morning, and so

975
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,080
that was pretty standard too, so the city was supporting that effort.

976
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:24,000
My mother was a great lady, that's kind of a nurse's auxiliary volunteer at a hospital

977
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,679
at Campadero, and they were at uniforms, they were in the military or anything, but they

978
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:40,719
would write letters for soldiers and keep them company in the hospital, so she did that

979
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:45,360
during the whole war, this is a volunteer.

980
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,079
Were you able to go out there at all, or was that off limits?

981
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,480
I don't remember going on the base during the war, afterwards I did, once the war was

982
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
over.

983
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,120
I'll take that back, we didn't go out there, because we were in the gym doing something,

984
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:08,760
oh I know, yeah, my dad had, during the construction of it, they had a baseball league, or softball

985
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:16,920
one or two, and my dad coached one of those teams, one of the construction teams, and so

986
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:23,400
I was on the Campadero a couple of times, and one time we were in the gym, I guess it would

987
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:32,240
be, and there was a whole slug of POWs in there, we were storing POWs at Campadero to the war,

988
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:41,480
and these were African Corps guys, Germans, and by the way they were a tough looking bunch,

989
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:47,320
and then there were also Italians around, and they were more open than friendly and stuff,

990
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:54,080
so they were being housed there, and I don't know if they were escaped or not, but like

991
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:59,680
the security was very tight, they had a pretty well, pretty good as it was, that's interesting,

992
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,720
I hadn't known about that.

993
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:06,880
They expansive it there, it's amazing when you see it now, but the expansive it there, it was

994
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,600
amazing when you see it now, it's quite, and there's not a lot there, it was supposed to be

995
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,440
the second biggest town in Oregon.

996
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:19,320
It was huge, covered maps, they had an artillery range, the Campadero, a lot of it

997
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:25,800
acreage for an artillery range, and we could get you're blooming away over there in the war.

998
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,200
You mentioned in your memoir that the family traveled to San Francisco for the world's fair

999
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,680
in 1939, oh yeah, do you remember that at all?

1000
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:40,520
Oh yeah, that was a great outing, and we stayed with my great aunt, Liv and San Francisco,

1001
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,760
and yeah, that was a nice event.

1002
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,360
You taste your own, a lot of artifacts from that, I am.

1003
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,920
Well, tell me about high school, in Corvall's high school, you were the senior class president,

1004
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:01,560
I worked indeed, and had a lot of fun in high school, you know, I did not, a lot of

1005
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,920
people don't have good experiences in high school, but I had good experiences, you know,

1006
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,159
everything wasn't a hundred percent, but, you know, I was on the baseball team and the golf

1007
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:18,000
team, and, you know, had good friends and had a nice time.

1008
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,960
We won the State High School Basketball Championship, I was in junior, I wasn't on the team, but

1009
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:28,000
that doesn't get any better than that when you're in high school, you know, to win the

1010
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,719
State Basketball Championship.

1011
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:36,159
We made the decision to go to Oregon State College, it sounds like there was, there wasn't

1012
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,679
much of a decision to be made, there was no one that was kind of ditched.

1013
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:46,400
That was, you know, I can't think of anybody in my class, high school graduate class that

1014
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:55,679
did go anywhere else, you know, initially, and there were a lot of faculty kids in Corvall

1015
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:01,320
as obviously, so they were going to go to college, but that was the closest one and the

1016
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,920
most affordable, so that's kind of what we all ended up with.

1017
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,520
What was it like playing in your dad's baseball program?

1018
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:17,880
Fine, had a great time, had a great time, and it was, you know, no stress, everybody

1019
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,680
accepted it, and had a good time with it.

1020
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:30,920
That seemed to be the real honor for me.

1021
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,120
You played Summer Baseball?

1022
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:39,980
Yeah, that's what everybody did in those days, it was on the baseball team because, you

1023
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:46,400
know, my dad, we want to be playing, and he want, you know, his players to be playing

1024
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,960
too, and we'd be hired, we'd be sent out to these small towns, every town had a baseball

1025
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:59,440
team, a semi-pro baseball team, which means the semi-pro means professionals, ex-professionals

1026
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:06,760
could play on the team back in those days that it was a no-no in terms of amateur status,

1027
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,960
where it's supposed to play with pros, but they made an exception for baseball, so these

1028
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:20,760
town teams would have some ex-pros and some college guys and some locals, and it was

1029
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,920
a big deal for the town, and they'd get us jobs, you know, we're going to the woods

1030
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,699
or pulling on the green chain or something like that, and it was about what was out

1031
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:36,599
there, and the mill pond job, that was not a, I was living in Corvallis as Summer, I

1032
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:46,199
know, as Summer, we went to Air Force, basically or not, anyway, that was a mill south of

1033
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:56,079
Monroe, it was a big mill pond, and yeah, that was a, that was a dangerous job, and a tough

1034
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,079
one.

1035
01:04:57,079 --> 01:04:59,639
Well, tell us more about what that job entails.

1036
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:10,679
Well, every sawmill had a mill pond where they would store logs, and then the logs would

1037
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:18,319
be brought up to the, where there was a conveyor belt, and then would be then lifted and conveyed

1038
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:23,960
into the sawmill and cutting the boards, and the people that moved the logs around were

1039
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,079
called pond muckies, and you're out there in your court boots, and you're big pole and

1040
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:35,519
all with, and trying to corral these logs, and you know, push it across the pond, and

1041
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:42,000
get them over to the, where they could be picked up, and they were about five of us, I think,

1042
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,559
the pond muckies, and none of us knew what we were doing, and they dumped the logs in a

1043
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:53,639
one end of the pond of log trucks, and then we gathered up five or six of these, or

1044
01:05:53,639 --> 01:06:03,400
we had wrapped and propelled across the pond, and then they were a couple of professional

1045
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,400
pond muckies there.

1046
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,440
They would just split around, you know, and fly across the logs, and we were in the water

1047
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,279
half the time.

1048
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:18,440
Interesting experience, and this terrible water, you know, like I said, my mother wouldn't

1049
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,920
have been in the house, you know, and come over, because you smell so bad.

1050
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,920
So that's what we did.

1051
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,840
Those are the jobs that were available, minimum wage, no unions, you know, so you're just

1052
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:37,960
totally the mercy of the, you know, owner, but there you guys, that was, you know, that was

1053
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,800
a career for a lot of people, you know, for us at least, it was just a summer experience,

1054
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:50,600
so it was a great incentive to believe me, you know, to stay in college and find something

1055
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,400
better, because that's where a lot of these guys are going to spend their lives, you know,

1056
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,280
going on the green chain, and this sort of thing.

1057
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:03,640
Probably that's some interesting characters, I'm sure, you know, and then that was, spent

1058
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:10,400
summers in coquillo and Brookings doing that, those sorts of jobs, playing for their town

1059
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
team.

1060
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:13,400
Some rough and tumble towns.

1061
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:23,400
They were, they were indeed cowboys and Indians and fishermen and loggers and you know,

1062
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,160
he spent a summer in primal too, is that right?

1063
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:30,200
Primal, that's yeah, coquillo, Brookings and primal, those are my three stocks, yeah.

1064
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,160
Well, you lived at Del Toup's lot too.

1065
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:41,280
I was, yeah, I was a legacy and looked at other houses, but, uh,

1066
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:48,240
they had a nice combination, I thought, the athletes and scholars and waste rules, you

1067
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,480
know, didn't take themselves too seriously, that were, you know, a good bunch of guys,

1068
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:59,440
and so I never had regrets about that, that worked out pretty well, a nice group.

1069
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,480
You mentioned that, a particular fraternity, I don't know if Prank is the right word for

1070
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,760
it, but there's a story involving Skimmer's Mutant and Oregon, yeah, you see Oregon.

1071
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:17,560
You know, they had a, we had a genius for coming up with stuff like that, no, that's a true

1072
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:24,560
story, and when I was a freshman, my freshman class, I didn't have to go on that, but they

1073
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,320
went down and blew a piece of it off, they didn't get the whole thing, but they didn't

1074
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:36,560
die in my, some of it off, you know, Skimmer's new, never got caught and made it back, and

1075
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,640
two years later, went back and really, you know, got the whole thing this time, and it was,

1076
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:48,640
they also got the way with that, you know, the FBI was interviewing everybody on campus,

1077
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:56,240
and I was trying to get a handle on who, because Dynamite was considered a, you know, a

1078
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,520
dangerous substance, and they'd steal it from the stump, the last in class, during the

1079
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:06,080
state, you know, the egg school and some of that stuff, so these guys would steal Dynamite

1080
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:14,960
and the cabs, nutty, you know, just nutty, but they never caught out, they did it, and this

1081
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:24,440
was the big O, it was the big O and, and then the, the guys that didn't went back later,

1082
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:29,320
and they'd gather up pieces, chunks of it, and everybody had it in the house and a chunk

1083
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:34,000
of this, oh, when they're on their desk, the paint, I don't know, it was about that thick,

1084
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,399
you know, I mean, the paint, you were back in the calmer days, you know, Oregon State would

1085
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,479
be down in a painted orange, and then, Oregon would get up the next day and paint it yellow,

1086
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:49,719
so that it would happen a lot, but I think that was the last time I ever got, you ever got

1087
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:56,359
blown up? The last time. I don't know, no interesting sights, or I was

1088
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:03,839
down at that game in Watson one time, years and years later, and, and I was relating this

1089
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:09,839
story, you know, about my fraternity being the, I mean, Dynamite of the O, the skater

1090
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:15,039
of the O guy behind me, he says, came around, he says, is that a true story? Did you, you

1091
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,319
know, you read the guys that did that, and I said, yeah, and he said, I wrote my master's

1092
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:27,519
thesis on that, on the Dynamite of the O. So, it was a story that, you know, had legs, at

1093
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:36,939
least. What was social life like for you in school? Rich? No, very good, Oregon State

1094
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:42,639
was a nice, friendly place, and there were too many men, not enough women, you know, student

1095
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,619
body, it was mostly, you know, egg school, the engineering school, and all that, so men

1096
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:52,660
out there were the women, but it was good, you had a lot of fun, it was, if you lived

1097
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:57,420
on campus, which most of us did, we lived in our fraternities, you were not like at different

1098
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,780
universe, you know, your parents were glad to have you out of the house, and you were

1099
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,500
glad to be out of the house, and you might as well be in Chicago, you know, the amount of

1100
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:11,020
interaction at this place just wasn't any. What sorts of events were important on the

1101
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:16,980
social calendar? All house dances, you know, I said, one major, every house, then one

1102
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:26,300
major house dance every quarter, and those were big events, and, you know, if you were

1103
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,780
dating somebody, you'd get invited to her house dance, and she invited you to invite

1104
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:36,100
her yours, and so on, so there's a lot of that, and a lot of beer drinking at Murphy's

1105
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:41,420
Beach, you know, Murphy's Beach is, you know, South of town, there's a tabern, we've

1106
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:45,500
got about two or three miles out of town on the right-hand side, and I call it Murphy's.

1107
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:51,380
Yes, go Murphy's, okay. We'll just pass that half a mile, there's a road that goes

1108
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:57,300
off to the east, the highway, down to the river, and I think there's, I don't know what's

1109
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,900
down there now, but back then it was a gravel operation, and this is where all the

1110
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:06,099
people are, you know, took place, this is called a birth speech and nothing to do with

1111
01:12:06,099 --> 01:12:12,299
the tabern, but that was where everybody gathered. It's a new one to me. That's a new one

1112
01:12:12,299 --> 01:12:21,059
for me. Oh, yeah, that was the place, and you know, if anybody wanted to do a rest of

1113
01:12:21,059 --> 01:12:26,179
this or has this right, everybody knew where we were, and it wasn't just my fraternity,

1114
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:31,460
everybody was out there, you know, the football team, the basketball team, everybody, you

1115
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:35,420
know, so there's a lot of party going on, I don't think, nothing has changed, I don't

1116
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:41,380
think. We played baseball in the springs and the summer, did you do anything in the fall

1117
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:45,820
or winter to get ready for the season, or is it just being in all student? I think once

1118
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:55,300
the season was over, we were done. I don't remember any particular, each season, you know,

1119
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,699
footballs, football season, basketball season, baseball season, they had to start to stop

1120
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:07,180
time, and you know, we had guys that played three sports, and throwing a state, three major

1121
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:13,860
sports, and started each year, every team. So you can do that then, and I don't think

1122
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:20,820
that's, can they do that now? I don't think so, can. I think very few do if they could.

1123
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:30,299
How about school? What was your academic experience like? I was a moderate success, modest

1124
01:13:30,299 --> 01:13:38,099
success, I was in business administration, and that wasn't a very stimulating major for

1125
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:45,539
me, but, you know, I made my grades, and I was only on probation once, so that's not

1126
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:55,340
too bad for four and a half years. But I graduated. Any teachers about that made an impact

1127
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:09,220
on you? Any teachers? You know, Gordon Gilkey. He was a good teacher. This is a long

1128
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,659
time ago. Can you tell me more about him? I'm interested in Gilkey. Well, Gordon, you

1129
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:22,059
know, he'd been in Europe during the Second World War, and one of those people that participated

1130
01:14:22,059 --> 01:14:31,779
in saving the uncovering the German stashes of art and so on, and really made a major contribution

1131
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:38,899
there, and then he was also a woodblock print collector, and huge Japanese woodblock print

1132
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:46,100
collection, and taught the course codes, surveyed visual arts or something. Anyway, it was

1133
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:52,340
a review of, you know, art and history, and so on. Fastening course, and he taught that

1134
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:58,780
every year, and then, later on, he became dean, I think, of liberal arts to me. I think

1135
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:05,660
so. And he lived right around the corner every entire, or even state. He was a good guy.

1136
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:10,659
Every summer was there. Summer was a photographer. Yeah. Yeah. I can't think of his name now.

1137
01:15:10,659 --> 01:15:17,260
I'm going to ask you a little bit about the climate on campus during the time you were there.

1138
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:23,979
You were there towards the end, I think, of the large influx of GI Bill students. You're

1139
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:30,019
mentioned in your memoir, they were somewhat aloof. Oh, yeah. And I'm guessing that you have

1140
01:15:30,019 --> 01:15:35,099
a sense of why, from your own military experience. But can you talk a little bit about the GI

1141
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:40,060
influence on campus way right there? Well, it was huge. You know, first there was a huge

1142
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:46,100
number of them. And then, a lot of them are married. They're older. These guys, you know,

1143
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,100
they weren't interested in the morning look, lids, or any of that stuff that just went by the

1144
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,539
boards. You know, they weren't having any of it. You know, these wanted to get in there and

1145
01:15:54,539 --> 01:15:58,820
get their education and get on with their lives. And so that changed the whole campus

1146
01:15:58,819 --> 01:16:04,899
tenor, you know, totally. And then here, it went to my group, you know, went to the

1147
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:10,899
high school graduates and never, you know, didn't want to do anything. And they all, the

1148
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:18,259
upper two classes in the fraternity house were all over two guys. And they ran these fraternities

1149
01:16:18,259 --> 01:16:26,699
like boot camps. The guy down the hall for me, one of the seniors, I think it's a senior

1150
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:33,699
there by that time in Bob Kyle. He then wound in the battle of the bulge. He didn't mess

1151
01:16:33,699 --> 01:16:40,139
around with those guys, you know. And they didn't take any, you know, very serious and very

1152
01:16:40,139 --> 01:16:44,899
business-like and they were good role models, you know. We learned from those guys. So,

1153
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:51,300
yeah, they changed the whole campus philosophy and turned it upside down. And then they were,

1154
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,739
I started in 1949. So they were kind of a tail end of it. And the ones that came

1155
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:02,460
along after me, none of us had ever been in the military. So occasionally where the Korean

1156
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:09,260
war came along and that changed a lot of things. We had a lot of Korean war veterans around.

1157
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:14,180
So did the workloads tradition die out at that point? I mean, that was very strong before

1158
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,900
then. What's that? The workloads and things like that that just ceased to exist.

1159
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:22,500
Yeah, that just sort of, I think people tried to get it back in place. But if I don't think

1160
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:29,580
it everybody, it wasn't the same as it had been. And things were changing anyway. It wasn't

1161
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:34,460
just the World War II events. The whole world had changed. The Second World War just changed

1162
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:40,180
everything. The whole majors didn't matter anymore, you know. New technology was coming

1163
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:46,579
on. And so the very revolutionary, in retrospect, you know, very revolutionary period.

1164
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:56,300
Yeah, well, and you mentioned some, I'm trying to ask about the subject of race. And especially

1165
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:02,780
the example of Dave Mann, who you write about in your book. It was not a revolution on campus

1166
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:07,940
by any stretch, but it's an inkling of a very gradual change that was going to come later

1167
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:15,380
in terms of the topic of race at OSU. Well, Oregon State was a pretty, pretty one race

1168
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:22,780
institution at the time. We had black students from Africa, exchange students, and Asians,

1169
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:28,500
of course, have been around for a long time. So it wasn't totally quite, but it was predominantly.

1170
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:36,820
And there were no black athletes. Oregon had had black athletes in the 30s, football players,

1171
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:49,859
Jackie Robinson's, or brother. Mac was a track man at Oregon. And so Oregon State was, you

1172
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:56,699
know, late to the game. And Dave Mann was recruited out of California to come and be Oregon State's

1173
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:05,019
first black athlete, which he was. And it was very successful. And I didn't know him very well

1174
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:16,660
personally, but he was he stood out on question about it. And he was he was not a he was not

1175
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:23,340
a self-refacing person that a good way to put it. But not a bad person. I mean, he didn't

1176
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:29,820
cause any problems or anything. He just he was new to, you know, this was a new thing

1177
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:38,420
in Oregon State and Corvallis. Confident day. Yeah, very confident. Good athlete. Didn't take any

1178
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:44,139
stuff, you know. You want a campus boxing tournament? This isn't fascinating. There was a campus

1179
01:19:44,139 --> 01:19:50,739
boxing tournament. Yeah, Intermural. Intermural. Well, it was, yeah, Intermural. And yeah, they just

1180
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:59,059
three, three about, three roundabouts. Yeah, he won that. Was this a period of time where

1181
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:05,060
there were many concerts on campus? Still were. And what was that like? Did you have, did you have

1182
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:09,660
classes in them? You know, I don't remember having. I think they're mostly used for office space

1183
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:17,500
and meeting rooms and things like that. They weren't big enough for you for a classroom. So just

1184
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:24,700
reflective of a period of expansion on campus. And they have influx of new students. Yeah. I want to ask you about

1185
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:34,099
a couple of things that happened at OSC during your time, a 1950 gilcal seam open. Do you remember, do you

1186
01:20:34,099 --> 01:20:41,300
remember that? Well, I don't remember having any major event that, you know, it had been coming for a

1187
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:46,739
long time. It just didn't magically appear, you know, everybody knew it was coming. It was, yeah, it was a

1188
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:52,739
big event. It was the state of the art at the time. You know, that was the Oregon State's athletic

1189
01:20:52,739 --> 01:21:00,260
facilities were first class. Parker Field was new. Oregon had riggedy wooden stands still.

1190
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:05,380
California schools have big stadiums but, you know, Oregon State's facilities were pretty good.

1191
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:13,260
The spec key was responsible for most of that. Really? Yeah. Do you have recollections of attending basketball games in

1192
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:22,159
the old men's gym? Yes, I do. So, Slant's fields, teams, knock over, UCLA, twice in a row. Yeah, you get

1193
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:27,220
pulled. It's a hell of 2,000 people. Yeah. There was about anything around all the way around the

1194
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:35,420
men's gym. And, you know, the two. Yeah. So, yeah, you know, I started going there when I was

1195
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:42,820
probably four or five years old. And what's been quite an environment? It was. Just athletics,

1196
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:54,019
so, you know, how about football at Bell Field? Well, it was a mud bowl, so it was, you know. And, you're close to

1197
01:21:54,019 --> 01:22:03,340
the field. But the student section was on the west side. And in those days, if you can believe it, the

1198
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:15,980
COVIDs all wore heels and stockings and pants just for the game. Do you imagine that? Yeah, it's amazing. Well,

1199
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,180
we sort of wind up here a little bit. I'm interested in knowing about your continued

1200
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:28,300
association with OSU after you graduated. Obviously, we had a career in the military. We went on to other

1201
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:36,020
things and graduate studies in the career. And, well, when I came, I left where you stayed in

1202
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:44,619
1954, spring of 1954, I came back in 1966 or 1967 on something like that. And I lived in Chicago

1203
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:51,980
in Evanston and Lincoln, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, other places, you know, the kind of stops you make. And I was

1204
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:57,300
hired by Oregon Health Sciences University, recruited by them to fill a certain role they were

1205
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:06,300
looking for and came back. And my dad had just retired for your stay so there wasn't any of that

1206
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:12,539
overlap anymore. But he was, of course, very closely involved. And, you know, he had

1207
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:19,539
seasoned tickets, so I just picked up going to the football games and, you know, that sort of thing. But that, I

1208
01:23:19,539 --> 01:23:29,019
wasn't associated with Oregon State in any direct professional capacity. But it was still part of

1209
01:23:29,019 --> 01:23:37,180
our lives. And then, you know, I was a lifetime member of the life member of the alumni association. The

1210
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:44,779
varsity always kind of kicking in a little bit, they were getting things going. And then the baseball field

1211
01:23:44,779 --> 01:23:52,779
project came along. Pat Casey put that together and asked me if I would be on their committee and did

1212
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:59,779
what's, you know, the fundraising committee. And we were successful largely because of the $1

1213
01:23:59,779 --> 01:24:08,779
million grant from Goss, John Goss, who sold a piece of property and was going to be a huge tax bill. So we decided

1214
01:24:08,779 --> 01:24:17,779
to do something with it. And that got Kit Pat started. And he'd probably been there. This wasn't a, you

1215
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:22,779
know, he, I don't know how many years he'd been coaching. But I'll bet it was close to 10

1216
01:24:22,779 --> 01:24:29,779
by the time a stadium project came along. So, you know, you think of the baseball project. And I think of the

1217
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:36,779
whole program as a project, you know, so different from what it was, you know, back in the day. It's patting

1218
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:41,779
me. And overnight success, you know, just came in and waved the magic wand. But that's not the case at all.

1219
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:48,779
He started right from the ground zero. And they didn't even charge for baseball games when Jack

1220
01:24:48,779 --> 01:24:56,779
Wright was there. And even in Pat's early days, he could just walk in anytime, you know, free. And, but he is a,

1221
01:24:56,779 --> 01:25:01,779
I think a remarkable person, a remarkable developer. I think he would have done well in whatever he was.

1222
01:25:02,779 --> 01:25:08,779
He, you know, elected Oregon State that he chose baseball, but he had, he's a talented person, you know,

1223
01:25:08,779 --> 01:25:15,779
not your normal, just your regular everyday coach. And he spearheaded this and we meet up here in Portland.

1224
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:24,779
And we, you know, tap people we knew. And, and there were some major donors that stepped up and that

1225
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:33,779
built. So that was a huge, that was a real sea change, you know, the baseball program. They have that facility.

1226
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:38,779
It was interesting because prior to that time, I mean, Jack Riley and Tencelli and others might have

1227
01:25:38,779 --> 01:25:48,779
done something similar. But until, I wish one of the presidents who was, who was after Montgomery

1228
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:53,779
earlier, probably burned, could have been. No, no, it wasn't. It was after him, even.

1229
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:58,779
Yes, sir. Oh, yes, sir. I think it was Paul Rissert, right.

1230
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:08,779
Said it would be okay to build a permanent facility on that location. But the university's policy prior

1231
01:26:08,779 --> 01:26:14,779
at that time had always been that this was too valuable, a piece of property. You know, it is right, not the center campus,

1232
01:26:14,779 --> 01:26:19,779
but it's right on campus. And they wanted to put dorms there and things like that.

1233
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:29,779
Well, so they wouldn't permit any kind of improvement in the facilities. Nothing until Rissert said, okay, you

1234
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:36,779
can do this. And then that opened the door for Pat to go out and begin to, and then John Goss coming

1235
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:42,779
along. But those two things came together and made it possible to put a permanent facility on that site.

1236
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:46,779
You know, it's the oldest baseball field in college baseball.

1237
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:51,779
Well, it is the oldest or the second oldest, I think there might be some dispute about that.

1238
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:57,779
But it's one of the two. And somebody wandered out there one day in 1907 and drove a stake in the ground.

1239
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:05,779
And this will be home played. But it's never moved. You know, it's been a big success.

1240
01:27:05,779 --> 01:27:10,779
I think that was good for Pat, good for the program. I think it made it possible to recruit.

1241
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:16,779
And that's everything in baseball. And Pat, now with his reputation, he just recruits nationally.

1242
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:22,779
I mean, he doesn't recruit. He just answers phone calls, basically.

1243
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:27,779
Stounding success. You know, somebody said, everything went to their one of their first college world series.

1244
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:31,779
I said, what was your dad? What would your dad feel about that? Yeah, but he'd be proud and nice.

1245
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:39,779
And he'd be dumbfounded this way, wouldn't it? He just, you know, considering the facilities and the attitudes and so on.

1246
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:44,779
So he's, he's out of remarkable, remarkable job. Yeah.

1247
01:27:44,779 --> 01:27:48,779
Well, the last thing I want to ask you about is just your thoughts on the current direction of the university.

1248
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:53,779
Things have changed mightily in the last few years. And there's a lot of momentum heading in different directions.

1249
01:27:53,779 --> 01:27:57,779
What do you think of all this? Well, I think Oregon State's got really a lot to be proud of.

1250
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:04,779
I think, you know, the current administration has really been in place long enough.

1251
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:12,779
I think it's been, there's continuity there. There was some, you know, most of the president's in state more than four or five years.

1252
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:16,779
It's that, you know, they move on to other things.

1253
01:28:16,779 --> 01:28:24,779
So I think that continuity has been important. And I think they played the funding game very well.

1254
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:33,779
The technology grants and all this stuff. I don't follow up with the microscope, but I don't think they have

1255
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:43,779
the reputation that they deserve. I think it's not, not really their fault. Every, every institution has areas of excellence.

1256
01:28:43,779 --> 01:28:53,779
And Oregon State is certainly no exception. But it's not the kind of thing that gets the headlines.

1257
01:28:53,779 --> 01:29:03,779
So, but no, I think it's a really fine institution. I know when my older son went there and had a great time.

1258
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:11,779
And so, they just completed a big fundraising campaign.

1259
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:19,779
Yeah, just about a billion dollars. Billion? Yeah. One of the better campaigns around the country, I guess.

1260
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:27,779
Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. So they do a good job, I think.

1261
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:35,779
I think Oregon State, Oregon State can be proud of Oregon State. And I think it's possible to get a good education there.

1262
01:29:35,779 --> 01:29:41,779
I think one of the things that was kind of a negative, when I was there, they had virtually nothing in the way of liberal arts.

1263
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:51,779
And you can only take two years, they only offered liberal arts on the undergrad or the lower division level.

1264
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:59,779
And that that closed out a lot of, you know, it's an age when you really ought to be looking around at, you know, other things.

1265
01:29:59,779 --> 01:30:07,779
And the opportunities weren't there. You had to challenge yourself into one of these technical oriented majors. And it wasn't always a good fit for everybody.

1266
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:14,779
So I think the fact that they expanded that, you know, that option is, I think, adds a lot to it.

1267
01:30:14,779 --> 01:30:18,779
I think they really made that return the corner for them as far as I was concerned.

1268
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:23,779
When they developed liberal arts college and the good major and so on.

1269
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:28,779
Well, Ralph, I want to thank you for this. It's been very interesting and fun and enlightening for me.

1270
01:30:28,779 --> 01:30:31,779
Well, it's been a real pleasure. Yeah, terrific. Thank you very much.

1271
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:38,779
Thank you very much.
