1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now you can edit out any extraneous sounds like I have to clear my throat and that kind

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of stuff.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Alright, so let's start if you would just introduce yourself, say your name and today's

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
date and our location.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My name is Kenneth Hedberg.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The date is September 9th, 2011.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, Ken, where were you born and where did you grow?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was born in Portland, Oregon on February 2nd, 1920.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And did you grow up in Portland?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, I actually know.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I spent my first six years of life there and then my father had a job that took him to Southern

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,159
Oregon, the Kusbe region, which is that time where we lived as called Marshfield.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:09,000
And after that, we moved to Oklahoma, Washington, where I spent my years from age about 12 to

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
16.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We were probably moved to Medford and I went to school, graduated from high school in Medford.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What were your parents' occupations?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, well, my mother was a housewife.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
During the war, she worked at the Naval Station in that story.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
My father was called a wholesale grocery salesman.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In those days, groceries were delivered by a truck from a large warehouse to the retailers.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And my father would travel to these small retail stores, some of them in outlying rural areas,

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and take their orders for groceries, which he would then write up on a form in the late evening,

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
early in the morning, take it to the warehouse and the orders would be filled.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the trucks would then take these groceries out to the various stores that had ordered them.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That, of course, passed pretty quickly in the time of better communications.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So that business is faded now.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So that was disappeared, actually.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That was a job that would require some moving around the family?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, well, my father had a, actually, know that he changed jobs.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He worked for a company called Mason Urban, which is now out of business,

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and they had several stores, warehouses, and southern Oregon and Medford and Kusbe,

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and in Astoria.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And he worked in all of these places.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For that company, as they move things around.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, these rural stores were, of course, separated wide intervals,

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and they were grouped together into what my father called a route.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, I'm given the other week.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He would go on a certain route, take him all day long.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And the next day, he would go on a different one in the third day and so on,

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
for five, six days a week.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it was a lot of driving, and some of it over quite significant distances.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's about as much as I accompanied around a few of these drives,

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
just to keep him company, he seemed to like that.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But it was, from my point of view, pretty boring.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'd sit in the car or go into the store while he took orders.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Of course, he'd have to stand around when the proprietor was waiting on customers,

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
because the customers were served first.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So there's a lot of waiting and watching.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm glad I wasn't in that business.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you have any siblings?

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, I had a sister. She died about three or four years ago.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Her child, of course, removed as a family.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know, nearly as much as she moved in a different group than an idea.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She was two and a half years younger.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So her high school group of friends were well behind mine.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we didn't have much of a social interaction as kids.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We just said different groups we were with all the time.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She went to Oregon State for a couple of years,

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and then the war came along,

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and she was a very good secretary.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So she dropped out of school and served as a secretary to a naval officer

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
at the Naval Air Station in Astoria during the war.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And afterward, he set up a Ritter State business,

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and so she went to California and served as the office manager for him.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And she married a young man from the area.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And so she lived most of her life in San Francisco,

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
in the San Francisco area.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Actually, she retired over the,

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and then the, I forgot what is called,

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the tunnel from the day area across into the valley.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Pleasanton.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What were your hobbies as a boy?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, in those days,

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we didn't have anything of the sort of thing they have now.

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I did quite a lot of family interaction in the evening.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I remember when my father was home early enough,

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and on weekends, we played family cards like Rummy and Pinocchio

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and things like that.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The only source of entertainment apart from the movies was the radio.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I can still remember my father and mother eagerly listening

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to certain programs in the radio among which were Amos and Andy.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you know that?

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, Amos and Andy, and a few of the other things.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And as for activity,

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I took up tennis when I was in Hokeham,

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and I played tennis all my life,

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
including on the Medford High School team and on the OSU team,

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I came here later.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So that was a hobby.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And the other one was we had a lot of group of pretty closely knit kids

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
in the neighborhood,

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and we played a lot of football,

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
touch football in the streets.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And that's mostly,

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
oh, I collected stamps,

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but that was, you know, everybody collected stamps on those days.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that's about,

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I guess that kind of summarizes what it was.

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No cell phones, nothing, no TV, nothing like that.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you recall being interested in science as a boy?

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was always good in school,

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
although I never really realized that I skipped a couple of grades

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and during the,

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
my real interesting science developed,

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
well, I was always interested in it,

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but it wasn't clear to me that I was going to be a scientist as a professional.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And through high school,

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and so on, science was always easy for me,

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
both physics and chemistry.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And when I lived in Hokeham,

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
there were a number of people who always came to me for questions about science.

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Excuse me.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I didn't,

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we didn't have homework in the same way then,

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
but it seemed to come so easily to me that I didn't have much trouble answering the questions.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then when I graduated from high school in Medford,

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it was in the height of the depression and my father had just lost his job.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And we were, I graduated in 1937 from Medford High School.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And there was no employment at all for young people.

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There was summer employment, which I availed myself for several years.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I worked in the orchards picking pears and southern Oregon.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You did all this by hand.

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And that's about the only income that I had.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There was nothing that a young high school guy with no specific skills could earn money at.

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I went along here and there for 25 or 50 cents.

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Not the going right then.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I made good money in the orchards when I worked there.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It was very hard, back-breaking, hot, dusty work.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But when your young man doesn't matter very much.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So back to your question.

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After I graduated, I began to wonder what I was going to do.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I know I wanted to go to college and my parents, neither of whom had gone to college.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
In fact, my father finished the eighth grade and my mother graduated from high school.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That was the limit of their education.

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I always told me they wanted me to go to college and said that they would match every dollar I could earn.

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, they pushed and put an end to that, of course.

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So one day I went to the Medford Public Library.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can still remember.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I walked in and that checked out a book in physics, elementary physics, and another one in chemistry.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And I took them home to read them.

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And the physics that was exposed in those textbooks of the day was pretty elementary stuff, mechanics, levers, and that sort of thing.

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The Manhattan Project had not a radio activity.

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That sort of thing was something that didn't penetrate to the high school level or in the textbooks of the time.

148
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I finally decided I liked chemistry better.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that started me on my career.

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I managed to, in 1939, in the winter of 39,

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
we were, as my father, as I said, lost his job.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And he was important living with his brother, trying to land another job.

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We had almost nothing in Medford, my mother and my sister and I.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And I was able occasionally to provide a little bit of money for groceries.

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
My father tried to send money, but at one point we were enough destitute so that the power company turned off all the electricity.

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And we cooked with a stove with some wood.

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And we had a camping lantern, a cold and lantern that we used in the evening in the house.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And we managed to avoid getting thrown out of the house, which is a rental in Medford, but just barely.

159
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So for some reason, I'm not able to, at this state, remember how or why enough money was gotten together to allow me to register

160
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
what was then called Southern Oregon Normal. No, Southern Oregon University.

161
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Southern Oregon State University, I guess. I don't know.

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And for ten cents a day, I had a friend with a car I could pay him and I rode back and forth with him, stayed at home.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I registered for chemistry and a few other things and took a number of courses in music.

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And that continued, I got all A's the first term.

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:41,000
My father told me somebody in Portland had said, you know, there was a guy, Kenneth Hedberg, I noticed that got all A's at Southern Oregon College.

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is that your son? My father knew nothing about this.

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I guess my mom didn't want to tell him that we had found money to send me to college, but the tuition was a bag of tell.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You know, it was something like $20 or $25 a term at that point.

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So he said, no, that can't be my son. When it turned out it was, he was not angry. He was delighted, actually.

170
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I stayed the second term and I got all A's except for one which is a B in piano I had taken a number of courses in music and harmony and composition and things which interested me.

171
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And at the end of that time, excuse me, this is going to show up on your, you're going to have to edit out these throat clearings.

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, at the end of that time, in the spring of 1939, my father actually got a job in Astoria and he and my mother decided that rather than she going to Astoria to join him, she would move to Corvallas and allow my sister and me to matriculate at Oregon State.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And she would set up a rooming house there. That rooming house would, we'd have three or four people staying with us and she would do the cooking and so on.

174
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And the rent and things that she collected would enable us to maintain a house so my sister and I could go to school. That was done.

175
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:49,000
At the time, I didn't realize what a sacrifice that was, but as time has gone on, I can see that was a monumental contribution on their part because I wouldn't have been able to go to Oregon State at all.

176
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Excuse me. Well, that was followed through and I had one scholarship, tuition scholarship, dualist use, so I didn't have any tuition to pay.

177
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And then the National Youth Administration was set up by Franklin Roosevelt and this enabled students who qualified to earn 25 cents an hour.

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I got a job in the chemistry department here at Oregon State handing out supplies to people who were in the laboratories.

179
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I continued for 1941, and then late 1940, my mother decided that we were now able to do this on our own.

180
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And so she moved, we closed the house and she moved to Astoria and I had pledged a fraternity and so I had a place to live and my sister moved into a co-op at Oregon State.

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And so I lived in my fraternity house for the rest of my career at OSU. I finished in December of 1942.

182
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which fraternity were you in?

183
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Theta Chi. It's still the same house and in fact fraternity road there has not changed much at all. I guess the houses have been renovated, but my social connections of the fraternity are essentially zero.

184
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I have a lot of professional connections that have spent my energy with.

185
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What was your social experience like in college?

186
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, the social experience was tremendous.

187
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
My son was just mature and just enrolled at...

188
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll think of him in a minute, but anyway, he wrote back, he's a very studious guy, and it's superb, he wrote back to my daughter that I was funny was having.

189
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He was really concerned that he wasn't studying, he just landed on the campus, well I told her that was my experience at OSU.

190
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't know how much is known about those days, but there was a lot of social life and the community was more strictly defined as...

191
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The independence, as they were called, and the Greeks, which concluded all of fraternities and sorities.

192
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And there were lots of social functions associated with the university on the students' behalf that I don't see now, but that may be because I'm a retired faculty member.

193
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But every Friday, I think it was, they had on the campus when I was a student something called the Nickel Hops.

194
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And this meant that all the sororities, in particular, I'm not sure about the independence, but all the sororities,

195
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:09,000
clearly the stuff in the living room, and they had music that played, and men would move from one house to another, and you paid a nickel to enter and dance with the girls that were there,

196
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and so you'd go from one place to another. So that was one way, an easy way of getting acquainted with girls.

197
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The other important social affairs, or series of social affairs in the campus, were a bunch of formal dances.

198
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There was something called the sophomore cotidian, the junior prom, the senior ball, and then something called the military ball that was put on by the ROTC group here on the campus.

199
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And these were formal dances. The women were long dresses, and the men were on some occasions even tuxedos.

200
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But no less than a dark suit at any rate, these ties everywhere.

201
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And they were events planned pretty much long in advance.

202
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So you got yourself, it was called a dance card, and you went around to your friends, and the fraternity, you exchanged dances. You came with your girlfriend of course, but you exchanged dances, you didn't dance with her the whole evening.

203
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So you generally saved the last dance, and the first dancer yourself, and a couple in between, and then you would be trading off with friends.

204
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't know what happens these days, but I look back on that with a good deal of phone. That was lots of fun.

205
00:21:45,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The campus was highly regulated in the sense that, well the put it in blunt terms, it seems to me that the university regarded itself and was looked at as a

206
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:15,000
as a de facto parent in the absence of a family, you see, so there were real restrictions, particularly on the women.

207
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If I remember this correctly, closing hours in all women's groups, there were very few married students, very few on the campus.

208
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I only knew one, one couple, in chemistry.

209
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So the students generally lived in living groups, a few of them had apartments, but not very many.

210
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And so these living groups, the women's living groups, had strict closing hours, the women had to be in by 930 on a school night.

211
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That meant they were going to the library, they were out of their living group at 7 o'clock and over in the library.

212
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And of course they could meet boyfriends and so on there, and you could arrange with your girlfriend to meet her at one of the Monroe Street places that served coax, you'd have a coax or something like that.

213
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But they had to be in by 930.

214
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And if they weren't, if they were late, they could be penalized by having their...

215
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well I'm forgotten, the penalties varied quite a lot, but they could be campused, which meant that they had to stay in their living group.

216
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They weren't allowed to do certain things that they otherwise would have been allowed to do.

217
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The men had no restrictions at all.

218
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
In my house there was a real strongly enforced study hours from 7 to 9.

219
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The house was supposed to be very quiet then and it was.

220
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So academia flourished at those times that his study did.

221
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The other thing I can comment on, there was no alcohol available anywhere, not in town.

222
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I think there was something like a two mile rule, there would be no retail outlet for alcohol within two miles of the campus.

223
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And that prevailed until rather late in the history of the institution.

224
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What you see along on road street now is a lot of places where you can get beer and other things and the students are clearly enjoying their Fridays like today at the Brew Station, for example.

225
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But on those days you couldn't get it.

226
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:19,000
In fact, Oregon, I forgot what the date of the overturn of prohibition was, but alcohol was slow to come to Oregon in the sense that, first of all, you could only buy it in the green front.

227
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You couldn't buy it in a restaurant, but you could bring your bottle in a restaurant and they would charge you a corkage fee and serve you.

228
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But a long time for that to be overturned.

229
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There's one incident that I can tell you about that I mentioned it before, but it was really quite remarkable.

230
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think it was in the winter of 1941.

231
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I think it was before Pearl Harbor when we had a tremendous ice storm.

232
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't know whether you've heard about this ice storm, but what happened was we had a freezing rain.

233
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And this was on the night of one of the old school dances, which were held by the way in the Memorial Union ballroom.

234
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The size of the institution when I first, in the fall, maximum size was, I remember 4,200 students.

235
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So the MU ballroom could generally contain all the people that wanted to go to a formal dance.

236
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
A lot of people couldn't afford going so they didn't.

237
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Well anyway, in the MU on this particular occasion there was an ice storm that began early in the evening and people began to show up.

238
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And as the evening drew on, the rain which had continued began to develop into a freezing rain.

239
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And the trees began to be branches, began covered with ice, all the power lines were covered with ice.

240
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And as the dance went on, all of a sudden the maybe 8,39 o'clock the lights went out.

241
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And what had happened of course is that the power lines were down because of the weight of the ice and so on.

242
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, this was an all school dance and it was dark. You see, no lights in the MU ballroom.

243
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So some of the scrounged up the candles and put them around the edge or some other form of light.

244
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But the MU lounge, which is very much the same as it is now, is a place where in these dances, couples would repair to rest a while and sit, smooch with each other.

245
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
When the lights went out, you could imagine the glee that that was greeted with.

246
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, then after a show, I happened to be up in the lounge at the time with my girlfriend at the time.

247
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And the lights went out and due course there came one of the shopperons, usually a wife of a faculty member.

248
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
She came in with a large candelabra with lighted candles and she put it on a big table in the middle of the room.

249
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And then she turned around and she walked and she walked back to the stairway down into the ballroom.

250
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
She got to the head of the stairs and disappeared.

251
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
One of the students there got up, walked over to the candle, brought all the candles out to the great chairs.

252
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And a few minutes, the same woman came back and she lit the candles again.

253
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And she turned her on and walked away but she didn't get to the head of the stairs this time before the student, maybe the same one, went up and blew them out again, again to great chairs.

254
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
This time she never returned.

255
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It turned out the lights were out as a consequence of that storm for the best part of a week.

256
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And that was devastating, well, devastating, it was extremely hard for my mother because we cooked on an electric stove.

257
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And we had all these students there, four of them plus my sister and myself.

258
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So she prepared the meals as best she could using pots and pans and so on in the fireplace.

259
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We had a fireplace fortunately and she could build a fire and do that.

260
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So essentially we camped for a week, remarkable experience.

261
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Well, as far as the campus was concerned, the consequences of that ice storm were devastating.

262
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The campus in front of the MU at the time was covered in a large number of trees, beautiful trees.

263
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Perhaps many of them Elm trees, I don't know.

264
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The ice storm actually broke the branches off of these trees to the point where it looked like a tornado and hit that section of the campus.

265
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You could walk through it in the daytime, it was still freezing.

266
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You could still see the ice branches lying everywhere on their trees effectively denuded of their branches.

267
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Well, I led to the removal of most of the trees in front of the Memorial Union.

268
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I suppose it was true if some other places on the campus also.

269
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't remember that, but I certainly remember the MU before and after.

270
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It was a remarkable thing.

271
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So that's more or less the way social life was said, well, football, of course.

272
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, there were a couple of other things.

273
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Football was mostly for the students and a lot of them went.

274
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But you weren't allowed to come with a girlfriend.

275
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The men and women sat apart.

276
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And if you walked in with a girlfriend, there would be a raucous cheer from the men's section.

277
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And they would shout the word fusser, which was a...

278
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And that term was sort of an epithet.

279
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There used to be a directory called the fusser's guide here.

280
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
People who look up the addresses and phone numbers and other students.

281
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And there were...

282
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Some of the townspeople went to, but the stadium would only hold a couple of thousand, I think.

283
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Maybe three thousand people and just one grandstand along one side.

284
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And maybe some instant bleachers. I don't remember that.

285
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But there were also organized on the campus four times a year.

286
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It may have been six, but certainly four.

287
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What were called Lysia, Lysia in the singular.

288
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And these were events that comprised visiting artists of one kind or another,

289
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
who often music.

290
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And the...

291
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I have heard Hartter Rubenstein play the piano here for Oregon State at one of these.

292
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I've heard Paul Robeson sing.

293
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And a number of other people, like a really famous artist, would come.

294
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And that was paid for, I don't know how, but out of university resources

295
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
because your student card admitted you to these.

296
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And they were held in the Old Men's Gymnasium, if I remember this correctly.

297
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And with a small student body, you always had enough space.

298
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The...

299
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I was going to...

300
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I lost the throttle when I was thinking about these Lysia, but they were looked forward to

301
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
a lot of people in the Oregon State students who are largely rural students.

302
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Agriculture was the biggest college on the campus or school it was called.

303
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And I guess this is regarded as an opportunity to expose them at least to a kind of a cultural side of life.

304
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But they were quite remarkable events.

305
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And I was enthralled.

306
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I didn't...

307
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
There's no history of music in my family, but I thought these were marvelous events.

308
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So that was essentially the way the campus was set up.

309
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It was the...

310
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh, I was going to say the basketball games were also played in the men's gym.

311
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And the basketball schedule was different than what it is now.

312
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
We have those called the Northern Division and the Southern Division and the Champions of these two

313
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
would meet for the Champion Coast Championship.

314
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's the athletic side of the things there.

315
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So what else can I tell you about the times?

316
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, I'm interested also in what your academic experience was as an undergraduate.

317
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, well...

318
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
After Southern Oregon Normal School, it was quite a change.

319
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Now, the normal schools were coaches, you know, were teachers' colleges.

320
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And so there was no major in science at all.

321
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And I just had elementary chemistry taught by a well-meaning lady that really didn't know very much.

322
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
A couple of years later, one of my friends told me that his brother was there in the same class as I was.

323
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And this brother told my friend that I knew more of the chemistry than the teacher did.

324
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't know whether that's true or not, but at any rate, that gives you kind of a level of instruction there.

325
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, when I came to OSU, that was a different matter entirely.

326
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And the first thing I took care was a course in analytical chemistry.

327
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And I was dismayed at my first grade in an exam in that course because by my Southern Oregon Normal standards,

328
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
it was a very difficult exam.

329
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And I didn't do very well on that.

330
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think I got to see or something like that, but I wasn't used to that.

331
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So I learned what I had to do to work hard.

332
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And I ended up with a B in that first term for which I was very grateful.

333
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And generally speaking, I did very well here after that.

334
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
After that initial shock.

335
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And there was a lot of interaction between faculty and students because the classes were much smaller.

336
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It was a good experience.

337
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And I enjoyed it a lot.

338
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Of course, the war broke out, and as I say, I spent a year here.

339
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Since I was in science, I was deferred until I graduated.

340
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And the campus was pervaded by a sense of what was going to be happening to almost everybody.

341
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The men on the campus.

342
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So a lot of the students chose paths that would take them into the military offices training, that sort of thing.

343
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
ROTC was required at that point.

344
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm sorry, I have to cough.

345
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I have this just allergy that comes this time of the year.

346
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That just about finishes my recollection of my undergraduate days here.

347
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Well, as I say, I played tennis.

348
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And we played Oregon, Washington State, Washington, Idaho.

349
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And to get to these places, we traveled by car.

350
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And usually that was the car of our tennis coach.

351
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He was the guy named Bill McCallop, who also played football here.

352
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And some of the faculty is a football coach of some category or another.

353
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So we drove.

354
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yet the Idaho, we drive a car, you see.

355
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then, of course, we'd arranged to play Washington State at the same time.

356
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So that was a long trip in and by present standards, a kind of uncomfortable car.

357
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But we were young and it was lots of fun.

358
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Were all of your chemistry classes in Gilbert Hall or did you ever have classes in the Ohio Kimstack?

359
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
All the chemistry classes at that time were in Gilbert Hall.

360
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:22,000
There was a building down on Jefferson and what is now 15th Street.

361
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That used to be called the Kimstack.

362
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Lenna's Pauling, of course, met his wife in the Kimstack.

363
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And I've often walked him around the campus.

364
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And one time, when we were walking down there, he wanted to go into the building and we went up.

365
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And we went on to the floor and he went into one of the rooms there.

366
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I can't remember whether the configuration was different from what he remembered, of course.

367
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,000
He was able, with reasonable certainty to identify the room in which he was teaching when he met Eva Helen.

368
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And he told me a couple of amusing incidents about the Kimstack in those days.

369
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What did he say about the Kimstack?

370
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Well, there was one famous incident.

371
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And you see, I guess he didn't have natural gas as we did later on as when I was there.

372
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And so when you had a burner in the laboratory, this was generally burning gas, perhaps subtly.

373
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I think it was in a steel tank.

374
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And that was mixed with oxygen in another Jason's tank.

375
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And these were admitted into the laboratory by Hoses.

376
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And there was a guy there, an assistant of some kind, and Pauling told me his name.

377
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But it was a foreign name, an Indian name, or something like that.

378
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
A student who was working there and being paid to do certain things.

379
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And he managed to get these lines connected up in the wrong order.

380
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:44,000
In such a way that when he turned on the tap, the higher pressure in the oxygen tank forced its way through the tube into the acetylene tank outside.

381
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, the consequence of this ultimately, for reasons that I want to explain, was an enormous explosion.

382
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And fire that destroyed the stock room in much of the section of what was called a chem shack.

383
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And Pauling said he never knew what happened to this student he wasn't hurt.

384
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Nobody was hurt, it turns out.

385
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But Pauling didn't know whether he had managed to get his degree or not.

386
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That much he was able to tell me about.

387
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
When I'd read the chem shack, I had a reputation for catching on fire.

388
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Did what?

389
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I had a reputation for catching on fire.

390
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Did it? I don't know.

391
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, this was certainly one.

392
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And you can see why I thought it was the method of firing up burners.

393
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The chemistry nowadays is done in much more batches, usually, in the undergraduate lab than it was then.

394
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I mean, if you made a preparation then, you made a pound of it and exaggerating.

395
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But I mean, you had a lot of stuff there.

396
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Nowadays, it's all green chemistry, very small amounts of things.

397
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And the summertime, I worked once on the...

398
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I don't remember whether I worked two summers or just one summer in another vacation period.

399
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:33,000
On the campus is a part of the surveying crew.

400
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And one of the guys who stayed with us, and my mother's upgraded rooming house,

401
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:49,000
was a guy who was a civil engineer and had a standing summer job.

402
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And he ran this line of levels.

403
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And so he taught me how to hold across things and so on.

404
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
He taught me what the signals were and so on.

405
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And that was better than working in the hot orchards in Southern Oregon,

406
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
but I didn't earn a lot more money out of it, and I can say that.

407
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
How about your stock room done?

408
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Oh, the stock room job.

409
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You signed up, there were a number that was all student-operated.

410
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, there was a head of the stock room.

411
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
My man named Stoney Wells, I remember that still.

412
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
One of the reasons I remember it, because I mentioned that name to my father,

413
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and he said, Stoney Wells, I know him, so I brought him around one time,

414
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and they shook hands and reminisce for a while.

415
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I don't remember what the connection was.

416
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But the students were the ones that actually did the legwork,

417
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and taking in glassware, handing it out.

418
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And those days you checked it out, you had a pad,

419
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and you filled out what it was you wanted,

420
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and handed that to a guy behind a window,

421
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
just like at a shelf someplace, and he would go get the items and give them to you,

422
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and then there was a return sheet, and when he returned it,

423
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the items had to be clean and dry.

424
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You put them back, looked at the sheet, made sure everything was there,

425
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
put them back, and then matched it up with the checkout sheet,

426
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
through the two away.

427
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So things were borrowed and returned from the stock room,

428
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and we who did this work behind the window,

429
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
were what we were being paid for by NRA, N-Y-A,

430
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
National Youth Administration.

431
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The first year, I got 25 cents an hour, and the second year,

432
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I got a raise to 30 cents an hour,

433
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
but that was big money in those days.

434
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You could buy a Coca-Cola for a nickel,

435
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and you could go to a movie for something like 25 cents.

436
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And a full plate lunch would cost you 35 or 40 cents,

437
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
something like that.

438
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I remember my childhood in Hoquim.

439
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
My father and my mother was away,

440
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and my father and I went out to a local rooming house,

441
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
it was called the Finnish boarding house in Hoquim,

442
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and they would serve meals to people who came in.

443
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It was family style, a big, long table,

444
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
a bunch of silent guys sitting there and spooning it in.

445
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And the cost of that, for the two of us,

446
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
for each of us, something like 20 cents a piece.

447
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's just a bag of tell by today's standards, unbelievable.

448
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Were there any classes or teachers that made a big impact on you

449
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
in the undergrad?

450
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh yes, there were.

451
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:19,000
The JP Mayleg was a very long-term faculty member here.

452
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
He was an analytical chemist,

453
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the first man that I really met on the faculty,

454
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
because that's the first course I had to enroll in here.

455
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
He lived to be over 100 years old,

456
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
and he was a man of incredible precision

457
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
in everything he did.

458
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
His analytical chemist seems to fit his personality,

459
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
because he did everything by the clock and by rules.

460
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
People used to say,

461
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
a JP Mayleg always walked to work,

462
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and he lived down on eight streets or something like that,

463
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and he would walk up Jefferson to the chem shack.

464
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And I was told,

465
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I don't think the story is apocryphal,

466
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
maybe the, I mean,

467
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
people used to stand and wait for Mayleg to walk through the gates,

468
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and they said,

469
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
you can almost literally such a watch by his coming in.

470
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Well, I had a little,

471
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
he got his degree at Purdue,

472
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and he never ceased to be very interested in what Purdue was doing.

473
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He was driving all his life to the student daily newspaper of Purdue.

474
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
He used to go back there for the summers to do research,

475
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
and he drove his car.

476
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And every year he changed,

477
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
he bought two new tires,

478
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
either for the front or the back and older, not yours.

479
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
These tires didn't land nearly as,

480
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
didn't last nearly as long.

481
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And then the war came along,

482
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
he couldn't get tires,

483
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and he was terribly upset that

484
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
it turned his life around

485
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
in an uncomfortable way,

486
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
because he was so used to buying these tires.

487
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
There was another man later,

488
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
made a great impression on me,

489
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and that was a man named James W. Ferguson.

490
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
He was an organic chemist,

491
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and as the war broke out,

492
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
of course, he left,

493
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and he went back and worked for the Midwest for Eli Lilly Company.

494
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But anyway,

495
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I learned an enormous amount of organic chemistry from him.

496
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He didn't do a lot of research,

497
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
but he was certainly a superb teacher

498
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
from my point of view.

499
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Another person, of course,

500
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
was Bert Christensen,

501
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
who became department chairman after I returned to the faculty.

502
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
He was remarkable in a way

503
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
because as a faculty member,

504
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
because it was very hard to do research here at the time.

505
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Federal grants didn't exist then.

506
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The kind of structure we have now,

507
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
like National Science Foundation, didn't exist.

508
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So you had to do everything more or less on your own,

509
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and you got very little contribution,

510
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
if any, from the state.

511
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But he managed to involve himself in research,

512
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
both with graduate students and undergraduates,

513
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and I worked for him for a year or so,

514
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and a very interesting project that we finally published.

515
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And that was my first publication with Bert Christensen.

516
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
There was another guy named Bill Caldwell.

517
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I never had as a teacher,

518
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
but he was a very popular instructor

519
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
of freshman chemistry,

520
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and very fancy demonstrations that the kids liked a lot.

521
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And then, of course, there was EC Gilbert,

522
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
who was a physical chemist.

523
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I grew to know all these people as a student,

524
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
but, of course, when I came back in the faculty,

525
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
all along the ones that I mentioned except Ferguson,

526
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
who were still here,

527
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Ferguson, after he went back to Eli Lilly,

528
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
he returned to Oregon,

529
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and he went to Portland State,

530
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
where he finished his career there.

531
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And after I came back on the faculty here,

532
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I saw him a few times in Portland.

533
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
He looked just the same.

534
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So those, of course, I knew other faculty members too,

535
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,000
but I didn't have them in any of the coursework that I took.

536
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So there's a project that you did with Bert Christensen,

537
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and that was your first experience of scientific research?

538
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Well, it was called...

539
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Are you asking what kind of work it was?

540
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yes, and that was your first research project.

541
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, well, it was called a micro-determination

542
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
of hydroxyl group.

543
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And it was an analytical technique,

544
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
where we worked with very small amounts of sample

545
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
using microbalances,

546
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
sealed them up,

547
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and then a reaction took place,

548
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and then we could analyze the mixture

549
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and we could determine one aspect

550
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,000
of the composition of a molecule.

551
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Later on, when I worked at Shell Development Company,

552
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I learned that our analytical method was being used

553
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
in that commercial analytical lab.

554
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So that was really pleasing to me.

555
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
They were big time down there.

556
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So by the time you were done with it,

557
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
at OSU, did you decide that you wanted to be an academic?

558
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
No, the war was on then.

559
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And I was faced with a decision

560
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
about what I was going to do.

561
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And I had two opportunities.

562
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The war work was going on in the chemical industry,

563
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and in particular, there were people

564
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
from Shell Development Company

565
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
who came around and they were looking for people,

566
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
recommended by the faculty to do war work on some of their projects.

567
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
The other opportunity,

568
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and I was interviewed by them on offer the job.

569
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
The other opportunity was to go into the Air Force

570
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
in a program that would have been, for me,

571
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in meteorology or in armaments, not in flying,

572
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,000
because at the time my visual security wasn't very good.

573
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And so I had been registered with the draft board,

574
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and I went to see Gilbert.

575
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He was a nice guy.

576
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I liked him a lot.

577
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
But he kind of grumbled.

578
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
He would talk in a little voice.

579
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
He said, I think it's ridiculous for you

580
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
to go into the Air Force and not use your chemical training

581
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
when you could do that in war work,

582
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
where they need skilled people.

583
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And so then I went down to my draft board,

584
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and I talked to the chairman of the draft board.

585
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And I think his name was Cindy McCollum,

586
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
or something like that.

587
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And at any rate, he was clearly a scot.

588
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And he ran a gas station downtown.

589
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And I explained this situation to him.

590
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And he said, young man, you better go in the Air Force

591
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
or we're going to draft you.

592
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Well, this caused me to think a little bit about this.

593
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
At that point, I knew I wanted to go to graduate school.

594
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You see, to make a long story short,

595
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I finally decided that I would take the job

596
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
at Shell Development Company,

597
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
which was a professionally extraordinarily valuable experience.

598
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But in terms of emotional contentment,

599
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
it certainly wasn't very relaxing.

600
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
First of all, I spent most of the war on 1A,

601
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
which is the draft status,

602
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
eligible for the draft.

603
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And you never know whether you're going to be drafted.

604
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And, well, I guess I shouldn't have said it that way.

605
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
When you're in 1A, you're eligible to be drafted

606
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and will be drafted.

607
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So I was always classified 1A by the draft board.

608
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
The company appealed to the appeal board in Oregon

609
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
on grounds that I was doing war work

610
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and supplied the paper verification of this.

611
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And because of the secretive and important nature

612
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
of this war work, I was always reclassified

613
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and deferred status of 2B.

614
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Now, this deferred status lasted for only six months,

615
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
dated from the time that you were first classified 1A.

616
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Well, it took about three months for this process

617
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to go on and for you to be reclassified to be.

618
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But by that time, you only had three months left.

619
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So I spent literally half of the entire war years in 1A

620
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
while the process of keeping me deferred

621
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
to do this war work went on.

622
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And it's more than just paper work

623
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
because before you're classified 1A,

624
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
you get a notice on the draft board that says greetings.

625
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And then you have to appear for a physical.

626
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Well, they would tell you, first of all,

627
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I had to appear at 5th and Monroe for a physical.

628
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I said, I can't do that.

629
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm in war, gauging war work down here.

630
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
We'll transfer your physical down there.

631
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
All this took time, you see.

632
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So then I would take the physical or I would go down.

633
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'd be transported to San Francisco after the procedure.

634
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And there, a whole bunch of potential draftees were lined up

635
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and we went through a physical that took at least.

636
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, it took all morning and the most of the afternoon.

637
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
At which time?

638
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You either classified as physically capable

639
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
or classified for aft, which means incapable of military service.

640
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So at the end of this, I was classified 1A.

641
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
My draft board was notified and they told me I was 1A.

642
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Then the company would get the papers and they would appeal this

643
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and we would go through the whole thing again.

644
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I did that about five times, I think, during the war.

645
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And on one occasion, just before the war was ending,

646
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
both in the Pacific, both in the Europe theater,

647
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
was in 1945 and I had an emergency appendectomy.

648
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
In those days an emergency appendectomy was a big deal.

649
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I was in the hospital in Oakland for over a week, bed ridden.

650
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
They didn't allow you to get up or anything.

651
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I had a huge scar like this along there.

652
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So anyway, in the middle of all this,

653
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
they were for a physical affair.

654
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But I knew that if you had a recent serious operation

655
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and that was serious in those days,

656
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
you were automatically deferred for six months.

657
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
So I tried to tell them that I had a recent appendectomy

658
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
so take your physical.

659
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So I lined up down in Oakland and we knew

660
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
course of transport across the bay with a hundred other guys

661
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
who seemed told a strip there and I said to the courseman.

662
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And the first courseman, I said, I've had a recent appendectomy

663
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and I said, I'm supposed to be deferred for six months.

664
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
He says, get in line.

665
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I got in line.

666
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I came to the next course and I said the same thing to him.

667
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
He said, get in line.

668
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Went through all the tests and saw them and passed them all

669
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and came to the last guy who was in the office of there

670
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and there's a guy who's supposed to test with your mentally fit.

671
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
He says, I called just and he looked me up and down and said,

672
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
you had a recent appendectomy.

673
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And I said, yes, I've been trying to tell him that all day long.

674
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
He grabs my papers and he writes deferred.

675
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Lastly, the war ended.

676
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
There was still going to be occupation forces.

677
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And the war ended, of course, in the Pacific in August of 1945.

678
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And a lot of the military were being decommissioned and sent home

679
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
and so on.

680
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And then the year were rolled around and the question was,

681
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
who are they going to have in the occupation forces?

682
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And at this point, of course, there was no further need of my services

683
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
in this war work and so I was eligible for this.

684
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But on the 2nd of February in 1946, I turned 26

685
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and they didn't take anybody over 25.

686
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So then I was automatically out of the occupation draft group.

687
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And then I entered KELTECH in the spring of that year,

688
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
left Schild Development Company.

689
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
What was the work you did yourself?

690
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Oh, well, there were several things.

691
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The Japanese, of course, had succeeded in overrunning all of the plantations

692
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
that provided latex for natural rubber, which is, of course,

693
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
really needed during the war.

694
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And so synthetic rubber had been discovered

695
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
and there were all sorts of ways of making synthetic rubber.

696
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So I worked a lot on the problem of synthetic rubber.

697
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Another thing that developed about this time during the war

698
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:02,000
was the discovery of the efficacy of penicillin, which is being produced

699
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
in a traditional way.

700
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
In our area, by cutter laboratories, it existed in either in Emoryville,

701
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
or in Berkeley, or Oakland, right down there, close to the Bay.

702
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
They had huge vats and they cultivated this and separated the penicillin,

703
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:27,000
which has distributed the arm forces, was not available to civilians at all at this time.

704
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And I worked on the extraction, the methods for extracting penicillin from this.

705
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The third thing that I did was, and that was probably the most interesting,

706
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:45,000
in many ways, was an aviation gasoline inhibitor.

707
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
No.

708
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Aviation gasoline at that time was 100 octane fuel

709
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
because all the aircraft were propeller driven,

710
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and there was a high performance engines that required that level of anana quality.

711
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
This was particularly during the North African campaign.

712
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So tanks of 100 octane fuel were shipped across,

713
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and then they had to stand on the desert.

714
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Now, one thing that happens to gasoline is that, over time,

715
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
they tend to form some gum which settles out to the bottom.

716
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Now, that gum, if it gets into the engines, of course, can be a very serious matter.

717
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So they apply what are called inhibitors to delay or greatly slow down the formation of this gum.

718
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And the stockpiles of fuel there in North Africa had in them a dye, a red dye.

719
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It turned out that when the gum was formed, this red dye would be occluded and takedown the fuel would change color.

720
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So the sergeants running the dump would realize what was going on,

721
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and they would then use this deteriorated fuel and jeeps

722
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and then motor vehicles of various kinds.

723
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, of course, it's obvious that what you want to do is to prevent this from happening as long as possible

724
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
because that's expensive fuel to be using in jeeps.

725
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And it turns out that a lot of the time that the stuff was gone, the dye was disappearing,

726
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
the fuel was still good.

727
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Well, we had a special inhibitor that was better than anything in use

728
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
that we were developing and testing in the desert with a drum that we have mounted

729
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
on the Mojave Desert at an army base with a bunch of thermocouples all through it

730
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:14,000
because we needed to figure out how quickly the gum formed in accordance with weather conditions.

731
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I mean, if you store these drums I mentioned in North Africa in the winter, there's no problem.

732
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's cold. And in the summer, it goes to pot very quickly.

733
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Well, how do you know that because you don't know what the temperature inside the fuel is

734
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
because in the summer a barrel at the bottom might be relatively cool and one at the top would be totally gone.

735
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Well, we put these thermocouples all through this test drum

736
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:47,000
and then we could measure the rate of formation of gum as a function of...

737
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Well, we took these temperature data from the thermocouples all through the drum

738
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and worked that up into something that we could call an effective temperature for the whole drum.

739
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And we could predict from a thermocouple in any place what the effective temperature was in the whole drum.

740
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And that would tell us how long that fuel could be expected to last.

741
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And so we did that in addition to developing and testing our inhibitor,

742
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
which turned out to be very good. Well, the war ended before the inhibitor could actually be used.

743
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And then of course the fuel now is not under octane anymore.

744
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So that never got into production, but if the war had gone on much longer it would have been.

745
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So that's the kind of thing that I did.

746
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And all of this laboratory work was a tremendous aid to me when I entered graduate school

747
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
because I know how to use my hands. I've been doing it for three years in the laboratory.

748
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And this job was in Southern California?

749
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah, at Caltech.

750
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, was that Caltech?

751
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I went to Caltech.

752
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But the shell job?

753
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Oh, the shell was it. It was an Emoryville.

754
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It was called Shell Development.

755
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And Emoryville was a small enclave between Berkeley and Oakland on the bay.

756
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So we're at about an hour and ten minutes. Do you want to keep going or do you want to?

757
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I can go longer. I probably should leave here about quarter to twelve.

758
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And if you want to.

759
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Okay.

760
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We can do whatever you like.

761
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
If you're, if you're, you'll have to definitely keep going.

762
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So you finished up at Shell and then you went to Caltech.

763
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
What was the process for which that happened? How did you mind if you held back?

764
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well, the laboratory worked in at Shell.

765
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I should say just a little bit more about that.

766
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It was a small laboratory, you know,

767
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
at Shell Development there were all sorts of projects distributed all over.

768
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
There was a motor lab out and back in which gasoline were tested.

769
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I was in the research end and there were the head of my small laboratory

770
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and another guy who had been working there for a long time.

771
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And I was brought in as a third guy to help these people.

772
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:34,000
We became all three of us very close friends in a social as well as in a professional sense.

773
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:45,000
The man who, who headed is named Daniel B. Luton, Jr.

774
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And he was a remarkable person.

775
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
He was a very good scientist.

776
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And at the same time, when the war was over, during the war,

777
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:06,000
he was very interested partly because of this North African stuff in climate

778
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and thereby associated himself with geography.

779
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So he knew a great deal about geography all over the world

780
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and especially about climate changes and temperature and so on.

781
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And he used to amuse us by coming up with some facts that you didn't know.

782
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:38,000
He said, where do you think the rainiest July in the world is?

783
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Where is the place where the rainiest July takes place?

784
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well, right away you think monsoon or something.

785
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It turns out there is some village called Chara Pungi India in India

786
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and he said in the monsoon season, he announced to us that it had something like 240 inches of rain in the month of July.

787
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
These are the kind of facts that he would come up with.

788
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Well, the reason I mention all this is that after the war was over, he retired from Shell as a chemist

789
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:26,000
but became so knowledgeable in this other area that he was appointed an adjunct professor of geography at Cal.

790
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And as time went on, he built quite a reputation in that field.

791
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
He came to Oregon State, gave lectures here, was invited up on the geography department.

792
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
He was a very, very interesting guy.

793
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:50,000
The other fellow was just as interesting. His name was Aldo de Benedictus and he was an Italian, obviously.

794
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He came from an Italian family who was engaged. They had a business in making pasta.

795
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And one time he told me, he says, don't let him kid you. He says the dough is all the same.

796
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's just a die that makes the difference between pasta.

797
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So the texture is different depending on the die but not the dough.

798
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Well, Benny graduated from Cal. He was an excellent student but he had a family of several children and he had to go to work.

799
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But not having a doctor's degree, he was not running the lab, you see. But Dan Luton treated him in every way as an equal.

800
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
He had his own projects and everything.

801
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Well, he spoke Italian fluently and Shell had occasion to want somebody that knew Italian very well to serve as a translator and so on.

802
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And after the war, he moved out of chemistry into marketing for Shell for his language skills could be useful and he moved to New York.

803
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Well, he did very well in the company. He moved up the ranks. Finally, when he retired officially from that aspect of Shell, they moved back to Berkeley, he and his wife and family.

804
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I guess his kids were growing and they lived there at the time. And then he told me he became very wealthy after he retired.

805
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And he told me how this happened. There is a company knowing as...

806
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm thinking advanced micro devices. It's not that one. It's another one that makes chips. It's the biggest chip maker in the world now.

807
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Chips for computers and so on.

808
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Pardon?

809
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
No, no, no.

810
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:15,000
No, they make... Well, I'm sorry, I'm a spoke. I think they make the devices for making chips.

811
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:31,000
But he told me, Benny told me, we called him Benny, that he was approached by some people about this project and he said about five or six of them sat down around the kitchen table in his house

812
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
in Berkeley.

813
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And he decided he would... they all put up $10,000.

814
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And that company just grew like wildfire and he ended a multimillionaire just by investing that money.

815
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And so he endowed a chair at Berkeley in chemistry called the Aldo de Benedictus Chair of Chemistry.

816
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:10,000
His wife went to UCLA and was a nutritionist. And he set up a similar thing in her name at UCLA with another million dollars.

817
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh, this was done years ago. It must be worth a lot more than that now.

818
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So I thought that was quite a remarkable story for a guy who spent his youth making pasta and working in a chemistry laboratory to end up like that.

819
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Okay, so Caltech, what decided me to go there? Well, I was thinking about going there and I wrote the EC Gilbert and he said, well, you asked.

820
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,000
He says, you know, there's a very good university right there where you're working. That's University of California.

821
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
For some reason, I wasn't interested in going to Cal. I don't know why.

822
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But it's a tremendous institution, of course, and great people there. But maybe I had enough of that area for the while.

823
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And so I applied to Harvard and to Caltech.

824
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And in due course, I was admitted to both of these as a student and then I had to make a decision.

825
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And so I talked to Dan Luton about all of this and he said, well, I said, Caltech has got Linus Pauling.

826
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Who else do they have on the staff? And I knew a lot of people at Harvard, you know, very famous people, but the only one I knew at Caltech was Linus Pauling.

827
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And Luton with his customary brusque and sense of humor manner, he says, look, he says, with Linus Pauling, they don't need anybody else.

828
01:17:49,000 --> 01:18:03,000
That was his famous line to me and I've never forgotten that well, that wasn't enough to decide me, but what did decide me was that it was only a short distance away.

829
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It was on the west coast in a place which at that time was reputed to be beautiful as indeed it was, I arrived.

830
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And I had a small beat-up car that I knew wouldn't make it across the United States.

831
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And so I packed this thing up with my dogs, my wife and myself, and we started out for Caltech.

832
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And I'll tell you this too, this is more a personal history than it is a professional history, I guess maybe. That's all right.

833
01:18:42,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Well, this was a 1933 Chevrolet Coop and it had been repaired once and I started out, we hadn't loaded my wife and myself and we started up a steep hill out in the valley just before you get into Southern California.

834
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And the car began to falter and it wouldn't go anymore.

835
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:22,000
But then if I stopped it, fired up the engine, it would catch and I could go a short distance, it would stop just as if it were tired, you see.

836
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So then I turned the thing around and managed to get over in the other lane, it wasn't a freeway on those days.

837
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And I went down at the bottom of the hill, the car ran just fine, pulled it up into a gas station which was closed for the evening and it had a mechanic associated with it.

838
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And so I pulled into this gas station, there was a light on in the house and back and I asked about mechanic, I came to the door and said, well, I'm a mechanic.

839
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I said, well, I hate to bother you, I guess you're closed, this is yeah, this is what's your problem, I explained this to him.

840
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And he put down his knife and fork, you're literally having dinner and he went out and he listened to this and looked, he says, you need a new fuel pump.

841
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
He says, I don't have one here but I think I know where I can get one.

842
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And so I said, gee, that's very kind of you and he said, no, no, that's okay and he gets in his car and he goes away in 10 or 15 minutes, he appears and he's got the fuel pump.

843
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And then he gets to work on my car, it puts a new fuel pump in on those days, it was a fairly simple job, you know, puts a new fuel pump in.

844
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
We fired it up and he says, there, that ought to do it.

845
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And I said, how much do I owe you?

846
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
He says, well, he says, you pay me for the fuel pump.

847
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I said, I got to give you more than that.

848
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And he says, nah, nah, sometimes you just have to help a guy out.

849
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:02,000
That was a lesson, you know, that happened when I was 26 years old, I had never forgotten that.

850
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And to my lasting regret, I never learned the guy's name or the location of this but I have never forgotten that.

851
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Absolutely remarkable, you know, he spent a lot of time and he wanted nothing for his time.

852
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So I didn't know that you were married at this point?

853
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Yeah.

854
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:30,000
But that was my first wife, we divorced some years later.

855
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:38,000
My second wife was, I met a Norway and we've been married for 55, 56 years or something.

856
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Anyway, they get back to Caltech, so I know where the hill got down, found a place my then wife had a relative there who offered to put us up for the night.

857
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Her husband was a postman in Pasadena.

858
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And he on his rounds happened, knew quite a bit about vacancies and so on which were very, very few.

859
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And in that time, in that area there were a lot of houses that had garden colleges and back of them.

860
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And he knew about one of these and I went up to my wife and I went up, interview these people.

861
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,000
There were old people, 80 years older, so nobody was in the house and they had fixed it all up.

862
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
They were very particular about their tenants.

863
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And after I guess we turned on the charm but they agreed for me to rent it to us and we were then able to wheel up our fuel belongings and put them in the house which was furnished.

864
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And we lived there for quite a long time.

865
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
When I went to Caltech, I presented myself at the main office.

866
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I said, I'm an appointment Mrs. Wolf, Beatrice Wolf, who's his secretary.

867
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,000
She said, well, Dr. Pauling likes to talk to all the new graduate students, so I'll set up an appointment for you.

868
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And she did.

869
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I can't remember whether I got an office right away or not, but at any rate I do remember the interview with Pauling.

870
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:46,000
He knew that I was from Oregon and from Oregon State and of course there was a kind of a bomb there because he had gone to them.

871
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Not a bomb, but at least there was something in common.

872
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And so he asked me when I was interested in and I told him I was interested in chemical kinetics and mechanisms and so on.

873
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And he said, well, he said it's too bad because the right person for you to work with would have been Roscoe Dickinson.

874
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But he died last year of cancer and we haven't anyone to take his place yet.

875
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But he said, we do have a young postdoctoral fellow here from back east.

876
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And he's interested in this kind of work and doing a project and it would be fine for you to work with him if you would like to and he would like to have you.

877
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And to this day my mind is boggled at that because you can't imagine our department chairman here suggesting that any of the incoming graduate students work with a postdoc and not with a faculty member.

878
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,000
His hands are very hard to come by and your research program.

879
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So I went to see this man whose name was C. Gardner Swain who later went on to a distinguished career at MIT as an organic chemist.

880
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And I worked a full year for him until his period was over.

881
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And we did a project, a project of his that turned out just fine and we published a paper on it together.

882
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:50,000
It was a oxidation of a local malachite green to malachite green carbonyl was an organic compound which then decomposed or, yes, to form a dye called malachite green.

883
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And we could study the reaction by watching the color formation of this stuff.

884
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:14,000
So it was a fine project and it was good for me because I was good for Gardner because I had had all this laboratory experience during the war, probably had more than he had at that time in the actual laboratory work.

885
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But he was a very clever guy and if we wanted to do a reaction at Shell Development Company, we had all the equipment on the shelf there.

886
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I could bring down what was called a thermostat, a constant temperature bath. I could put up the control mechanism and put in the controlling thermometer and the heaters and so on.

887
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I could have it all set up in 15 or 20 minutes at Caltech. They didn't have any such thing.

888
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So Gardner sat down, he was good at electronics and he drew out some components that we would need.

889
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And I went up to the avenue to an electronic store and bought these things, came back and spent, you know, a couple of weeks or three, maybe even more than that to the taking courses.

890
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Building this relay that would work, building it, putting it together, soldering wires and so on.

891
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And then I spent another week locating and getting transported a big tank which I could fill with water that would hold our samples.

892
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I set up the heater and put everything in it and got it going. It took me the best part of six months versus that 20 minutes I mentioned to you.

893
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Once it was set up, reactions, experiments went rather nicely and conveniently fast.

894
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
That got done in Gardner's year there. That was a good experience.

895
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:54,000
So at the end of that time I had to decide I was looking ahead, what else I was going to do.

896
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:08,000
And there was a young guy there, he was only about six years older than I was, that had a very, very good scientist.

897
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
He'd done his work with Pauling and the Nana to the faculty.

898
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And he had a group of young people that were kind of eager and I went to talk to him.

899
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And the episode of that conversation I decided to work with him and we had a project that we settled on right there.

900
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So Gardner left, I began to work with this man whose name was Werner Schumacher.

901
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So maybe we should talk about some of this at a later time.

902
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So I can do that.

903
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:59,000
What I can do is send you, well, why don't you send me an email and suggest some times?

904
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Because I think I can fit more easily than you.

905
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Now next week I'm going to be in Ashland doing Tuesday and won't be back to the weekend.

906
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Is that okay? The week following that we can do.

907
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Let's see.

908
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
We're looking into October now, Chris.

909
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
No, we're not.

910
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:39,000
After the Ashland week I'm free every day except Thursday when the president is hosting the Emeritus faculty.

911
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
That a luncheon.

912
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday are all available.

913
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Okay.

914
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And the next week is entirely free.

915
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That's the week beginning the 26th.

916
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Okay.

917
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Thanks again.

918
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Okay.
