1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, so we are recording now, and it was like last time, real briefly, just state

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
your name and date.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, my name is Kenneth Hadberg, and what else you want?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Date, date.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Date, today?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, and this is September 20th, 2011.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we left off last time, you had just made the switch over to there and she made here,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and that you were starting your research with him.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wanted to tell us about how that happened, how you met she made here.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I started out on that subject.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This was at Caltech.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can't remember whether I mentioned it.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I spent a year working with gardener Swain.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think I did that.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, at the end of that time, I interviewed Werder Schimmaker, who might pass them

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
him all several times, and he had a group of people.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He was young, not far from my age.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I went to see him.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We hit it off well, and I decided I would do my future work with him.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I began almost immediately, and we decided we would look at

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the number of boron compounds that we were able to...

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We didn't make them ourselves.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We got them from a guy at USC, whose name I can't remember now.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A distinguished inorganic endless today, right?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we began with DiBorane, which we measured, and were able to show conclusively that

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it was a non-ethane-like structure.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It had two hydrogens up above and below the boron, boron, boron bond,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and the well-known bridge structure.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:13,000
After that, we took up a number of other boron compounds, including B4H10, B5H9, B5H11,

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and some substituted diBorane with chlorine and bromine atoms on them,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and also amino groups, amino diBorane, we studied all of these took place in the next few years.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think some of them overlapped.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was still working when some of them after I got my degree when I continued.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So that was an exciting time.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And excuse me, I finished my degree in June of 1948, and I was offered a post-doctoral position

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and that came about in an interesting way.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Pauline came around one time in spring of 1947.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That was only, or maybe it was a fall of 1947.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'd only been there for at most 18 months, and he said,

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I think you should write up your work for a degree.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And I said, well, I was hoping I would be able to take another year and work that year with Professor Badger,

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
who was a distinguished spectroscopist.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Pauline said to me, well, he says, you write up your thesis and get a degree,

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and see that you get a fellowship so you can spend an extra year working with Dick Badger.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then he said, you know, you'll make a lot more money after you get your degree than you would before you get your degree.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So why not? Your studying doesn't stop at the time you get your degree.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So the logic of this was impeccable, and I said about writing up my work for my thesis.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I'm sorry about this thought. I had the same problem last time.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I finished writing up my thesis.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now the troublesome aspect of this is that my supervisor, Werner Schumacher, was off on the Guggenheim Fellowship in Denmark.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so the person that nominally oversaw my research was Robert Cory.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Robert Cory, of course, he and Pauline published a series of seven papers that ultimately led to Pauline's winning an Nobel Prize for his Alpha Helix.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And other things as well.

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Anyway, Bob Cory didn't know anything about electron diffraction, but he was a very nice, friendly man.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And he helped me over some crucial points.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I said, I'm having a lot of trouble writing this thesis, getting it all right.

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He says, well, he says, tell me what it is you're struggling with.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And so I told him, he says, well, why don't you write it down?

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So I wrote down what I had been telling him, and then edited a little bit, and that took me over home.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Anyway, I finally finished my thesis, and took my examination.

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Pauline was not present in Werner. He was not present either.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He was still being a Denmark.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So, excuse me.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,000
After I got my degree, I continued to work for a while on the projects that I had been working until Werner returned to Denmark.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then I was sure enough I've got my degree polling returned.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I received notice that I had been awarded an A.A. Noise Fellowship, which enabled me to spend a year working with Richard Badger, which I did.

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I learned some spectroscopy in that year.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But on the side, I continued my work in electron diffraction as well.

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, that was a very nice year. At the end of my fellowship year, I was appointed a research fellow at Caltech.

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I worked on a grant that Werner Schumacher had with the Office of Naval Research.

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
At that time, the Office of Naval Research was sponsoring basic research.

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I didn't have to have much to do with the Navy as far as I could make up.

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So, I worked on that for a couple of years. And then in 1951, I think it was Pauline said to me,

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
oh, maybe I should go back a step.

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:56,000
During this year, a number of people showed up at Caltech from abroad, mostly post-doctoral people who were anxious to work,

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
either with Pauline or some other dignitary and Werner Schumacher.

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I became quite friendly with a number of these people, including a guy from Norway named Ultibus Johnson.

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm getting just a little ahead of the story there, but because I decided after I'd had a couple of years that I should have a post-doctoral fellowship,

81
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
maybe abroad or something like that.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So, I decided that I would continue my work in spectroscopy.

83
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And so, I filled out an application for a full-bright fellowship to Belgium.

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There was a man there with whom I wanted to work.

85
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And so, I filled this thing out, sent it all off and got back on notice and due course a few months later, something unfortunately.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My application had been received too late to be considered in that year's batch of full-bright fellows,

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but they urged me to apply again for the following year.

88
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, in the following year, my friend Ultibus Johnson, later friend,

89
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ultibus Johnson showed up from Norway and he was a specialist in electro-indifraction,

90
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and I had known him not personally, but through publications.

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And we hit it off.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We became very friendly with my wife and myself, and him and his wife, and he had two small daughters.

93
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And so, we worked together at Caltech for a while.

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then, as the year drew to a close, he said,

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
why don't you apply again for a full-bright and apply this time to go to Norway instead of to Belgium?

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I said, well, that sounds to me like it might be worthwhile.

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Maybe I'll do that.

98
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
About the same time Pauline walked into my office one day and said to me,

99
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think you should apply for a Guggenheim fellowship.

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is how he didn't say, would you like to?

101
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He said, I think you should do this.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, Pauline carried such an oral with him that when he made a suggestion,

103
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you almost always followed through and decided that was a prestigious fellowship.

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And so I thought, gulped and said, OK, well, I'll do that.

105
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So I wrote out an application form, which was essentially the same proposal for research

106
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that I had written to the full-bright program.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I sent this off.

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And I waited around a while, working away with Werner, not knowing what was going to happen.

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, Tom Bustjansson went back to Norway.

110
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And in due course, I got a letter from the full-bright people saying that I had been awarded

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
a full-bright research fellowship to go to Norway.

112
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And this paid all my living expenses and paid my transportation back and forth.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And then about that same time, maybe a little later, Pauline walked into my office

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and said to me, well, are you getting ready to go to Norway?

115
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And he didn't know anything about my having received the full-bright fellowship.

116
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I said, well, I didn't know I was going.

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I think I may have the chronology inverted here a little bit.

118
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think maybe he came in before I received notice of the full-bright fellowship.

119
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That makes a little more sense in retrospect.

120
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I said, I didn't know I was going.

121
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He said, well, the selection committee generally follows my recommendations

122
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and he turned and walked out.

123
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That was a total conversation we had on the issue.

124
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And a bit later, I got a letter from the good and high people saying I had been awarded a good and high fellowship to go to Norway.

125
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And it was $3,500, well, now.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then the full-bright notice occurred and there I had gone from where I had no support,

127
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
where I had two rather well-endowed fellowships for the same period.

128
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I thought, well, you know, I have to let them know.

129
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So I rolled off to the good and high people, said I'd also been awarded a full-bright fellowship research fellowship.

130
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They said, the good and high money was given to me irrespective of whatever other awards or monies I had.

131
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, I felt pretty good about that.

132
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So, well, of course, I set the same letter to the full-bright people.

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And they wrote back after a while and said, we normally subtract money from additional grants, from the full-bright grant.

134
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But that, the amount of money that you have from the other source should be enough to support you for the full period of your time before we will take any action on this.

135
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And they said, we have determined that the $3,500, this is in 1942, that went a long way then.

136
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That $3,500 is not enough to support you in Norway for a full 12 months.

137
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So we will not subtract it from the amount that we give you for the full-bright grant.

138
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, the full-bright grant was the equivalent of a little more money than that actually.

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't remember what it was in Croner.

140
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think it was 4,200 Croner a month, and there was $7 Croner to the dollar then.

141
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So that was about $600 a month.

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So that went in $75,000.

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And almost 10,000 bucks in those days were big bucks.

144
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well, at this time, my first wife decided that she met somebody she preferred to me, and so she left me, and I had all this money.

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was going to go to Norway with as a single person.

146
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I booked passage on Mauritania, and I traveled across the country, visited a couple of laboratories.

147
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I went to Oak Ridge and visited some friends there, went on to New York, sent my luggage on ahead,

148
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and due course, I embarked on the Mauritania, which took me to Southampton.

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I spent a few days in England, and then I set sail again on another ship to Norway.

150
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And when I arrived there, this was an origin ship liner.

151
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was met at the pier by my friend, Ultima Stilinson, and the number of other people that I had met there.

152
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I didn't mention that I had been to Norway once before, after I had met Boston, so I went to an international meeting in Stockholm.

153
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And on the way back, I stopped, so I'll buy and shadowed it in a little bit about what we were going to do.

154
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And we had a big party. That was a fine party. I can still remember it.

155
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know whether I should go into the details there, but anyway, that was a great party.

156
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So he and his friends and collaborators in the laboratory met me at the boat.

157
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And they had been looking for a place for me to live.

158
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This was in Norway in 1950, the October of 1952, first of October.

159
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And it was after the war, and Norway hadn't really begun to recover very much then.

160
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So they told me that they had found an apartment, and they were ashamed to say it was terribly expensive.

161
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But they thought it might suit me pretty well, because it was very close to shopping.

162
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I had a...

163
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, let me call it a district, anyway. I called my use to it.

164
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And I had a fine apartment there, and it was owned by an English woman who had been separated or divorced from her husband.

165
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And she'd gotten this apartment. She was going back to England, where she came from originally, and was going to run it out for a year.

166
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And it cost, my friends told me, the sum of much over price was 150 crore a month. That's $20.

167
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Now 150 crore, remember, my first check was 4,200 crore, and that paid my rent for the entire month.

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And so anyway, I moved into this place, which was furnished.

169
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It had a kind of a couch or a bed, but it was perfectly satisfactory and had a kitchen, a bath, and all of that.

170
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Kind of a studio arrangement, within walking, the easy walking distance of the university, up on the hill.

171
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So I lived there, and I had determined before I left that I was going to learn the language.

172
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And my friends, Boss Johnson, had been talking to the cultural attaché at the embassy, and to the people in charge of the full-by program.

173
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And they had managed to find me a set of records, called, and those that are no longer existent, I think,

174
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
extent to, called, lingual phone records, and they got me, they were 78s, and they got me an old record player.

175
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
A friend had one of those, and so I could play these records on them, and they could hear the sound.

176
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Along with these records came a book, and this book had a picture on it, and it had the text that was spoken.

177
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So the idea was that you put the record on, and the first lesson, of course, was almost obvious.

178
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The words were ones that you could transliterate from English, you know.

179
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So very slowly the words were spoken on this page, and you could see the picture of what it was describing on the facing page.

180
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And so I would look at this, and the spoken word would come to you, and then there would be a pause, and you were supposed to repeat after this, mimicking the accent, but tonality as closely as you could.

181
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And so this, I later came to admire these records very much, because at the same time you saw the written language, you heard it spoken, and you had to speak it.

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And there was no translation except in the picture.

183
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And believe it or not, this happened in 52, I can still recite lesson 1, 2, 3, almost by heart, because after you had gone through this thing,

184
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:06,000
there was another section where they were asked, you were asked the question relating to this, and you had to respond to that.

185
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You see, it was quite remarkable, and an example of this, the first sentence was describing the picture is,

186
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
now you can almost say what that, no origin is a language which has almost the same word order as English.

187
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And that the odd means this is, and this is the family handsome in this picture.

188
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then there's a bestifier, sit there, e in, li in a stool, grandfather is sitting in a walking chair.

189
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And you could see that, if you know, at the bottom it says bestifier, it says grandfather is here, look in the picture, and there's an old man, you know, the beard.

190
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And he's sitting, sit there, you know, that right away, in e in, and li in a stool, you already learn that stool is chair, and li in, it means rocker.

191
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Anyway, that's just an example. And I went through, every day I came back from the university, I would sit down, I would study, it's amazing.

192
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
These things only played for three minutes if you played them through. It took me an hour to an hour and a half to get through a single lesson doing everything they wanted me to do.

193
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And in the morning I would go up to the university and I would, my friends saw, you know, they knew I was doing this, and I could recite the whole lesson to them, which caused proxisms of laughter.

194
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:52,000
One of my friends said, the guy, there were several voices, as the lessons went on, the first was a man who had a, he was an Norwegian, but he was a rector of the university at that time.

195
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And my friends swore they could hear his voice speaking when I spoke to them, having mimicked his accent.

196
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Well anyhow, when I first went up to the laboratory to meet Paul Stehonson in the work environment, and we talked, we knew what we were going to do here.

197
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He introduced me to his laboratory assistant, whose name was Lisa Smith-Ick, and he said, she's only been working with the three months, but I think you two should work together because I am an administrative duties I'm occupied with also.

198
00:22:31,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So we engaged in this project, and Lisa and I worked on it together. Well, when I was introduced to her, I was ever so impressed because, of course, I was introduced in English on the first day or two, and she spoke to me in English, and we had a conversation and I later asked, well, have you spent any time in, what did you learn your English? She said, well, I learned it in school, I said, haven't you been to England or the States? Oh no, no, she says, I've never been in an English-speaking country.

199
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It impressed me so much, and this is true all these people, you know, you'd walk in, they've never been out of the country they can talk to you in your language.

200
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Which of us can do that here? It's almost impossible.

201
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Anyway, we worked together for two or three days, and then I, very interested in music, and the also Philharmonic, played downtown, and I got on the tram one time, went down to the town.

202
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, I think, oh, in the first few days I was there, I decided I needed to have my own car.

203
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There were very few cars, and also at that time, my use to it today is one of the busiest places in town.

204
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean, it's bumper to bumper getting through there. When I lived there, it was rarely a car, and they were all pre-war things.

205
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The country was so destitute, of so devoid of money that cars were very, very hard to come by.

206
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But anyway, I could buy a car, there were agencies there, but I had to pay for it in the foreign currency, and I had to agree to sell it.

207
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I mean, I had to agree to export the car.

208
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It had a special license plate on it, indicated it had a Q number on it, which means owned by a foreigner, and means you didn't buy tax.

209
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So the upside of all this was that if I sold the car in the country at the end, tax would have to be paid on it at that stage.

210
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I bought this car. So I drove the downtown to go to the symphony here a few weeks later.

211
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And as I walked in, they're still picking up her ticket as I was picking up mine.

212
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So we sat together, enjoyed the symphony, and afterward I asked her if she'd like to have a after concert snack.

213
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And so we went to a restaurant of famous place called Blooms that is still there, and we had a big cheese spread and had a good time together.

214
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And we again date regularly.

215
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And the upside of all that was that after my year there, I went back to the States.

216
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And there was a decent eye we're thinking of getting married.

217
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And I wasn't quite ready to commit because I hadn't quite recovered from my first marriage.

218
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But at any rate, I got back to the States, and then I proposed to her, and I came back the following summer, which is 54, and we were married in Oslo.

219
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And that, say, 54, I guess we've now been married 57 years.

220
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Anyhow, that was a romantic outcome.

221
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I got, I've often speculated about this later.

222
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Suppose that full-bright application that I had applied for to Holland to Belgium had been successful.

223
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
My life would have been quite different from what it is now.

224
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Such things, fate turns on.

225
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Were there any problems with your family?

226
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
How do you mean marrying a fair foreigner?

227
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Her mother had died a couple of years before I arrived.

228
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
She had a sister and a father.

229
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
A father worked in a bank, a personal manager of a bank.

230
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And she had an aunt, the sister of her mother, that lived upstairs in the apartment building.

231
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
My wife's family is going back to generations as a distinguished one.

232
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:27,000
They came from Denmark, and my wife's great-great-grandfather was the foreign minister of Denmark.

233
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And he and his, one of his siblings, founded essentially the New York Times of Denmark,

234
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
called Poulotique.

235
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And so the family had an interest in that newspaper.

236
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:52,000
One of the other brothers was a distinguished newspaper, my name is Critique.

237
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The name is well-known.

238
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's called Brandes.

239
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can find books written about the Brandes family in Denmark.

240
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's a great-great-grandfather and great-great-great uncle.

241
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So anyway, Elisa's mother stemmed from this group,

242
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
as did her aunt upstairs, who became kind of a surrogate mother to her,

243
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
after her own mother died.

244
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So we came back, Elisa's father.

245
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I enjoyed him a lot.

246
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He was very taciturn.

247
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Some Norwegians don't say very much, but I think he was pleased that I could speak to him in his language.

248
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
He didn't know.

249
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
He could speak a few words in some words of English, but he wasn't as comfortable in it.

250
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So we hit it off very well.

251
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And Elisa's aunt too, she was a nutrition type person.

252
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
She had beautiful furniture and paintings and so on.

253
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And her husband was a distinguished Norwegian scholar and so on.

254
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Very wealthy.

255
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And this family, Elisa's aunt, uncle, and her cousin, to whom she is still very close.

256
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We see them quite often.

257
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They have a lot of fancy stuff.

258
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They have paintings by Toulouse with track.

259
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And they have munk originals, Edward munk, watercolors and lithographs and so on in their house.

260
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That was just something on the wall.

261
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I was pretty impressed by all that.

262
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So after we were married, I...

263
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Do you have a Norwegian lady?

264
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
No, we married in the city hall in Norway.

265
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You haven't been in Norway, have you?

266
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
No, well, they have an absolutely beautiful city hall.

267
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And it's got marvelous paintings around that huge murals on the wall that depict the development and evolution of the Norwegian nation.

268
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And outside they have some carved, huge carved wooden figures from North mythology.

269
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Wooden is there on his eight-legged horse with two ravens ahead, all in wood you can see up there.

270
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So no, we were married.

271
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
These had a reinstall license before I arrived and we were married in this office.

272
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It was a civil wedding.

273
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm not sure, but I think, as far as I know, a lot of the Norwegian weddings are done in that fashion, at least of the generation that Lisa stems from.

274
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So after we were married, we fussed around a while because we had to get a visa for her.

275
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And that's a story which irritates me still.

276
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So we applied for a visa down at the embassy.

277
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And the embassy is very worried that there are foreigners that want to marry American citizens simply to get into the country.

278
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And you have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops.

279
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And time went on, one wait, turned it two, turned into three, and so on.

280
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And no word, no word at all.

281
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And so I finally wrote to a friend of mine that I had met at Caltech and then was working as a scientist working in Washington.

282
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And I explained the situation to him.

283
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And he pulled some strings and discovered that the application was sitting on the desk someplace in a pile of papers and they were working through and they would get to it.

284
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So I virtually blew my top at this because here I am sitting in Oslo and not getting paid because I'm not working waiting for some secretary to clear my application for the visa.

285
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So I wrote to my congressman in Pasadena.

286
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And he wrote back on the other dismissal, dismissive letters saying we have to make absolutely certain that these marriages are not marriages of convenience.

287
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And you can imagine how I felt about it.

288
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He was a conservative Republican.

289
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I probably turned him into a Democrat forever, but anyhow, eventually we got the visa.

290
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We got on the plane, flew to Washington, spent a night there, then went on the Pasadena.

291
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And my wife was very tired at this time and discouraged.

292
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And when Norway had beautiful atmospheric conditions, you could breathe deeply and the sky was clear.

293
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And we landed in a heavy smog time in LA and she later says she felt like getting right back on the next plane and going home without experience.

294
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So we stayed there and I went back to work at Caltech as a senior research fellow now and continued until I learned about the job at Oregon State.

295
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Now, shall I go on to that?

296
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
No, I have more questions about Caltech.

297
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll take a little bit more in this.

298
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So it sounds to me like the first experience you have that trust was with Schumaker?

299
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
No, it was Dick Badger.

300
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I did a lecture on the fraction with Schumaker, which is a different technique.

301
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Some people call it an electron spectroscopy, but it is not.

302
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm sorry?

303
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Can it be bundled under the heading of crystallography or is that a separate discipline?

304
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's a separate discipline, but it's similar to the crystallography in the sense that you measure a diffraction pattern.

305
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The diffraction patterns are very, very different because I'm looking at molecules on the gas and x-ray diffraction looks at molecules and is in a crystal or at least in a condensed phase.

306
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So how would you classify your discipline in the view?

307
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Well, how do you mean classify it?

308
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's a technique for studying the sizes and shapes of individual molecules.

309
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So would you call yourself a physical chemistry with infrastructure or chemistry?

310
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So I guess I'm wondering at what point did you decide this is something you want to pursue?

311
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, I see.

312
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, when I was at Caltech, as I say, I started doing organic reaction mechanisms for a year, then I did electron diffraction.

313
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And in the course of this, I did some crystal structure with two other people.

314
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And then I did spectroscopy with Dick Badger, so I had four different experiences there.

315
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Now, this is a little unusual because at this institution, it's rare that a student works for more than one person in the course of getting his or her degree.

316
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Usually you pick a supervisor and you work on his projects and write up a thesis and you're out of here.

317
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But I worked and in my thesis, the Badger work, of course, I was a post-cultural fellow at that time.

318
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But in the course of getting my degree, I did three things and all of these things were written up in my thesis in different sections.

319
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That's a little unusual. Probably a little unusual for Caltech, too, in that people often do two different things, but three with three different people is quite different.

320
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I don't know whether I mentioned that crystal structure was very interesting. It had to do with a compound arsenal benzene, which has a formula

321
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that I can describe verbally as two benzene rings and two arsenic atoms.

322
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It was generally thought that the benzene rings are hooked to the arsenic atoms and two arsenic atoms are joined together by a double bond, as we say in the language.

323
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But it was pretty well understood at that time that arsenic doesn't like to form double bonds very readily, and particularly with a compound like this,

324
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
there's no opportunity, for example, no oxygen, so round to form double bonds.

325
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So it was widely thought to be a dimer the one I described, just two units hooked together.

326
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But we suspected that wasn't true, and so when we looked at it, we found that there actually was a six-member ring of arsenic atoms with these benzene rings flopping off, one off of each arsenic atom.

327
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So it was a hexamer, really, and a very nice molecule.

328
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The interesting thing about this is, many years later, I got a photocopy and a large photocopy, which I still have.

329
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This is before Euro became the official currency of Europe.

330
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I have a 200-mark German banknote.

331
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Now 200 marks was a big bucks in those days.

332
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And on it is a picture, a man who is responsible for discovering the first arsenicles in use for treating syphilis in particular.

333
00:38:44,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Well, one of the arsenicles used was I gather was our senomenzine, because on this banknote our paper is actually cited with the three authors and the date, which happens to be wrong, but at any rate it's on the face of this banknote.

334
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I thought that was lots of fun.

335
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So, anyway, that's what I did at Caltech.

336
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And I call myself a structure chemist.

337
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So the thing that led me into electron diffraction was, you have to realize, this was 50 odd years ago now, it was kind of a cutting-edge technology.

338
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It was the best way, everything considered, of determining the sizes and shapes and motions of individual molecules that are unaffected by the presence of others.

339
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This was a crystal structure, of course, of molecules that are all packed together.

340
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And the other technique that works also on the same phase is microinspectroscopy.

341
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But in order for microinspectroscopy to succeed, molecule has to have a dipole moment and a lot of them don't.

342
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Our senomenzine, for example, would not have, so you can't study a lot of things, but we can study anything we can get into the gas phase, select on the fraction.

343
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So, I decided I would continue with that work, because I like what I was doing with Schumaker at Caltech, and that's what got me started.

344
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So you've been seeing Schumaker and Cori, I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about what they were like, because their personalities were like a few centimeters socially.

345
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, I can tell you, well Schumaker, in my way of thinking he was a brilliant scientist, but not aggressive in the sense that he pushed like a lot of people.

346
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You know, in science, it isn't always enough to have talent.

347
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You have to be a salesman as well, and people like Linus Pauling, he is a tremendous salesman because he had a personality that took in the whole room.

348
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So his, and yet a sense of humor in his lectures were very, very heavily attended.

349
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:52,000
People had come from miles around to hear him, and I've heard him lecture to packed halls in several foreign countries.

350
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
For other people, who are distinguished also, but have a very tiring personality.

351
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And some of these are one noble prizes, you know, but they don't have a public acclaim that a person like Pauling does

352
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:21,000
or Ahmed Surwel knows from contact. And these guys sell themselves, you know, and there are other people too.

353
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So Schumaker was a brilliant scientist and a very critical thinker.

354
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
He was amazing in that respect.

355
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:42,000
He was so highly regarded that Pauling used to come down and bounce his ideas off of Schumaker.

356
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
He would come into the office, you know, and talk to Schumaker and say,

357
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Werner, what do you think of this? And he would describe something.

358
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And other people, the organic chemists from the Third Floor of Caltech,

359
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:11,000
names are getting harder for me to come by quickly, would come down, talk to him about various problems they had.

360
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And he was like a bulldog. He couldn't let go of a problem. He would analyze it, turn it around upside down,

361
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and if this, that, et cetera, et cetera. These people would sit and listen very carefully to him.

362
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So that's the kind of guy he was. He also, we went hiking in the Sierra backpacking together.

363
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
We became close personal friends, as well as my, me being his student.

364
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So we did hikes in the high Sierra's on a couple of occasions.

365
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I used to go every summer for, anyway, one to two weeks backpacking in the high Sierra.

366
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So we would do that. And he was eager and interested in that.

367
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There are a host of interesting events, but you see, I'm not quite sure how much of this I should go into,

368
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
but let me talk about Cori. Cori was a, he was a very nice man.

369
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And he helped me a great deal when Schumacher wasn't there in that last year when I was writing up my thesis.

370
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And he was a crystallographer.

371
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And I don't remember the details, so I won't try to recite them, but I've read them.

372
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You can get them. The Caltech archives tell all about polling, encountering Cori and inviting him to come to Caltech.

373
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So at any rate, he suffered from some kind of a nervous disorder.

374
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It was not Parkinson's in that he had some ticks that would cause his whole arm to move a little bit.

375
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And when he walked, he walked sometimes with a little bit of motion.

376
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And I'm not quite sure what it was, but that was not evident in the speech when you talked to him.

377
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And when he was sitting down, you didn't see any Parkinson's like motion at all for me.

378
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But he would come to see me, and I could see him in a time I wanted.

379
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He was responsible for a very large, excuse me, laboratory.

380
00:45:49,000 --> 00:46:04,000
He was headed up by a guy who was making compounds of the sort that polling was interested in that played a role ultimately in his formulation of the Alpha helix.

381
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So I don't know much more about him than just that.

382
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,000
To this day, I'm very grateful for what he did for me in the time of Schimmick's absence.

383
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Do you know Dan Campbell?

384
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yes. Dan was a very nice guy too and he had a very nice wife.

385
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I knew Dan Campbell quite well because there was a very free social order at Caltech.

386
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
All kinds of parties with the students, postdocs and the faculty.

387
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You have a student party, you know, and everybody would be invited and Dick Badger would show up with his wife and Dan and his wife would show up.

388
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And others as well.

389
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Polling didn't come to these parties as far as I know.

390
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I don't remember ever seeing him there, but I do remember a number of them in which people from physics can Dick Feynman showed up in a number of these.

391
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I heard Feynman play his bongo drums at these parties.

392
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So Campbell was a nice guy.

393
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
He had a medical problem which was solved.

394
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
He had colon cancer and they removed a large tumor from his colon.

395
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But I don't think he ever suffered a recurrence of that.

396
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
He was what was called an immunochemus and that was something that Polling was interested in at the time and immunochemus straight.

397
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So does that answer your question about what I knew about Campbell?

398
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Did you ever buy any chance to eat Roger Hayward?

399
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yes.

400
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
No.

401
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
But only in passing.

402
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Roger Hayward of course was illustrating Polling books for him.

403
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And he had a number of beautiful figures in various books.

404
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But only in passing.

405
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I just met him.

406
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I had never had a chance to talk with him.

407
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
We have Hayward's papers.

408
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
We also have the papers of Jack Demitz.

409
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Well do you?

410
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yes.

411
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah, I guess you told me that last time.

412
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about Jack with it.

413
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And then the person and also why is he important among scientists?

414
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh.

415
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Well, I didn't talk about Jack before.

416
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Did I?

417
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
No.

418
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Jack became a very honest to this day, a very good friend of mine.

419
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:51,000
He showed up after getting his degree in Scotland with Jim Robertson.

420
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And he came to Caltech.

421
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And in the British system, you know, when you study for a PhD,

422
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
you do your undergraduate work.

423
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You study for a PhD.

424
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But my understanding is you don't do much coursework from that point on.

425
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So Jack attended lectures at Caltech.

426
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
You see, on subjects that he had an interest in that he had not been exposed to before.

427
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But we worked together a little bit.

428
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We published a paper together.

429
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And Jack has an absolutely incredible sense of humor.

430
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And he could do, I don't know.

431
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
He's not a pushy guy.

432
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's kind of a laid back life sense of humor, you know.

433
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But he's not a retiring individual at all.

434
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,000
He's a very social guy. He's just not a pushy social guy.

435
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So he came to Caltech and he was working on crystallography,

436
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
on an electron diffraction.

437
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And then he was joined by, I won't say he was joined,

438
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
but another guy came named Leslie Orgel.

439
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And Jack and Leslie became very good friends.

440
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Leslie, he died recently, but he was a distinguished scientist.

441
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:26,000
He was a theoretical chemist to begin with, but begin turned to molecular biology later on.

442
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And went to the Salk Institute and had a distinguished career there.

443
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Jack, when Pauline won his Nobel Prize for chemistry in 54,

444
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
we had a huge big, and then we put together,

445
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
let's call it a review in the Valleville sort of thing,

446
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
where there are lots of skits and songs.

447
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And there was a talented fellow named Ted Herald, also from Britain,

448
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
who could write music and play the piano.

449
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And he composed a lot of stuff.

450
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And among other things that were composed were little acts for a participant

451
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
who would do a kind of monologue.

452
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And Jack was involved in one of these.

453
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
That's the famous one.

454
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The whole thing has been recorded.

455
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You probably have a copy of it here.

456
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's called the Road to Stockholm.

457
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
In there, there's something where one of the individuals

458
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
who's sitting in his laboratory looking out the window

459
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
at the young girls going by in front of a cold Bunsen, as Jack puts it.

460
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
If you haven't heard that record, it should be put on tape or a disc

461
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:02,000
because it's on shellac and homemade and it tends to deteriorate.

462
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So Jack participated in things like that.

463
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Then a young lady came

464
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and they began to go together.

465
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Her name was Daphne.

466
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I don't remember her last name.

467
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But at any rate, they became very close and became engaged to be married.

468
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
She was a post-doctoral person working in biology.

469
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And they had met at one of these social occasions, I guess,

470
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and they were together a lot in groups,

471
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and big parties, all of this were.

472
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And then Jack's period, Daphne went home

473
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and Jack's period at Celtic ended, and he went home.

474
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And then it turned out that she had decided against the marriage

475
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and broke the engagement.

476
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Well, Jack at this time was working with Dorothy Hunchkin and Oxford.

477
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And I was on a trip to Europe for some meeting or another.

478
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And I stopped by and visited with Jack and he told me that it was really a hard thing for him.

479
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But it turned out Daphne never married after that.

480
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We're not quite sure.

481
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And the reason that they broke up,

482
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:39,000
it's a little obscure, but I can say this at least as a rumor.

483
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:46,000
She decided that Jack was Jewish, his Jewish, and she was not.

484
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And this conflict, religious conflict, apparently,

485
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
was something she decided she couldn't live with.

486
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
At any rate, a year or two later,

487
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Jack met another young woman,

488
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
his present life, his name is Barbara.

489
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And he met her in Blackwells at Hunchford.

490
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
She was where she was...

491
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't know what her background is,

492
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
but she was working in the store there in Blackwells.

493
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And they hit it off immediately.

494
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
She's a beautiful girl.

495
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And they were married and they have...

496
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I think they have two children.

497
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So Jack, at the end of this period in Britain,

498
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
you may have almost unrecorded,

499
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
but you want me to tell you what I know about it.

500
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
His future career was...

501
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Dorothy Hodgkin, of course,

502
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
worked in the structure of Vitamin B12

503
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and had determined its structure

504
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and had presented this as a plenary lecture at a meeting

505
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
from what happened to be there.

506
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And she got a standing ovation for this.

507
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And she later won the Nobel Prize for her work.

508
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Well, this lecture or other work that she had been doing

509
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
with Arcanic molecules,

510
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
impressed the people in the organic...

511
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't know whether it's a college or a school

512
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
or whatever division,

513
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
in Zurich,

514
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
and they asked her to recommend somebody

515
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
who could be in organic chemistry

516
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
who could determine structures

517
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and she recommended Jack.

518
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Well, he went there,

519
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
table lecture, showed what he was doing,

520
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and the hope shot along this was

521
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
they hired him as a faculty member.

522
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Well, he's had a distinguished career there.

523
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
He just widened his horizons

524
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
immensely, became a professor,

525
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
which in the Old German system

526
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
is about the equivalent

527
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
of the well-regarded senator in this country.

528
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And he spent his entire career at Zurich.

529
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
He's now retired,

530
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
but I think he still has an office

531
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
although I'm not sure what he's doing.

532
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Occasionally, I run across him

533
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
in this country,

534
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and I write to him occasionally also.

535
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So,

536
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
he is a...

537
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
his reputation grew by leaps and bounds.

538
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
He's a foreign associate

539
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
of the National Academy of Sciences,

540
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and he gave the Baker lectures

541
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
at Cornell.

542
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's the same lecture series

543
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
that Pauline gave

544
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
that resulted in this book,

545
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
The Nature, the Chemical Pond.

546
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So, Jack's had a wonderful career.

547
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
He's a very, very nice man.

548
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Did he...

549
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
does he have any major discoveries

550
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
that you've known for?

551
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Well, it's a little hard to tell.

552
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Major discoveries in a scientific sense.

553
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
He has a lot of distinguished...

554
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
he has a distinguished publication record,

555
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
not in the mouth,

556
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
but the sorts of things that he took up

557
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and studied thoroughly.

558
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Basic science is very helpful to others.

559
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But I don't follow crystallography very closely,

560
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
so I can't tell you much about what he has done.

561
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I do know that he worked very hard

562
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
on the confirmations of rings

563
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
of various members in the rings.

564
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
There is elements of the rings,

565
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
five, six, seven, eight,

566
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and more rings and so on.

567
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
He's well known for that.

568
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'd like to talk about calling it for a little bit.

569
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It doesn't sound like he...

570
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It sounds like he was certainly a person

571
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
who spent time with others,

572
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
but it often sounds like it's not

573
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
a sort of social way.

574
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yes, well,

575
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
he wasn't anti-social at all.

576
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It's just that...

577
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
the kinds of parties of undescribing

578
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
that many, but not all,

579
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
the faculty attended.

580
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Like...

581
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Oh...

582
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm trying to think, for example,

583
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
you mentioned Dan Campbell,

584
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and Dick Badger, and Werner,

585
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and a number of other faculty members,

586
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
as well as postdocs and graduates.

587
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
We all have a big party, you know.

588
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Everybody was on a first-name basis.

589
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I never called Badger by anything other than his first name,

590
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
even as a student.

591
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
That's how he was known.

592
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Almost everybody was on a first-name basis

593
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
except with Pauling.

594
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
He was always Dr. Pauling.

595
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
He sort of carried an oral with him,

596
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
and although he was friendly enough,

597
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
you know, you didn't...

598
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
he only came so far.

599
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
He always called me by my first name.

600
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Even on visits around here,

601
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I never really called him by his first name

602
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
with any comfort at all,

603
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
because he never invited it.

604
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Now,

605
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I should tell you something.

606
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
This is kind of going back to my stay in Norway.

607
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The person who headed up the laboratory

608
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
when I first went there was a man named Old Hussle.

609
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
He later won the Nobel Prize.

610
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Hussle was...

611
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
is it alright if I tell a little bit about Hussle?

612
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
He was an interesting man,

613
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and the Norwegian system then

614
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
they had professorships just like the German system.

615
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
He was a professor of physical chemistry,

616
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
and there was a professor of organic chemistry.

617
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
His name was Banner,

618
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and a professor of organic chemistry,

619
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
these three groups.

620
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But Hussle was unique.

621
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
He was virtually...

622
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't know that I could call him an old vinyl,

623
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
but he had very light features,

624
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
very light hair,

625
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and he was very...

626
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and he had trouble reading.

627
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
He never married,

628
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
and he had a lot of money that he inherited.

629
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
He was a very good scientist.

630
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
During the war,

631
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
he was very aggressive,

632
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and he was imprisoned

633
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
along with a couple of other people,

634
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and they were kept in a camp in Oslo.

635
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
They were not allowed to teach.

636
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
They were closed.

637
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But against all regulations in this camp,

638
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Hussle organized a series of lectures and studies,

639
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
so the imprisoned people

640
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
who actually learned a lot

641
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
while they were incarcerated

642
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
from people who had lecture on topics,

643
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
you see, they had been put in the camp with them.

644
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So Hussle didn't knuckle under at all to the Germans.

645
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Well, in the war ended,

646
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and he went back and resumed his position in Oslo.

647
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
All the people who had been in the camp with him,

648
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
he used the familiar form of the dress.

649
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
At that time, in Norway,

650
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
there were two words for you,

651
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,000
which is do and z,

652
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
or d, rather, I'm thinking of German.

653
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So he was d with,

654
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
of the old school,

655
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
he was d with almost everybody

656
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
that he didn't know older people,

657
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
especially they always referred to one of his d and d.

658
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Anyway,

659
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Hussle,

660
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
after I had been there for a year and come back,

661
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I would always make a point to go in to see Hussle,

662
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
because he was the professor.

663
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
He was, in effect,

664
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I think, a kind of a lonely man,

665
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
because he had no family,

666
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
he had a, a live-in,

667
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
a huskieper who served him his meals

668
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and did everything around.

669
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I had a beautiful house.

670
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And one time when I came in,

671
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
you know, I was always going to see him,

672
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and we would shake hands,

673
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and he would go to the board

674
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and show me what he was working on.

675
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And then one time,

676
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
when he was working at the board,

677
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
and I had said d and so on,

678
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
he was saying d,

679
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
he turned to me and he said,

680
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
this is traditional in Norway.

681
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
He said, we have known one another for a long time.

682
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I think it is time that we say do to each other.

683
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Now,

684
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
a younger man could never propose that.

685
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It had to be the older man.

686
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And of course, I was knowing Hussle was ideal.

687
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I was quite honored by this,

688
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
because here I was a foreigner.

689
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I was saying, do to him,

690
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
where people that have been in his laboratory for years

691
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
that had not been in the campground thing were still d.

692
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And these guys had been around for 20 years.

693
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
He still said, d, you know.

694
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So,

695
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
but anyway, I guess

696
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I probably hit it off with him because,

697
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
of course, I always spoke no region to him.

698
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And he was so pleased that an American would come

699
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and learn Norwegian, say.

700
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Anyhow, he invited Lisa and me to dinner at his house

701
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
on time.

702
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
We went back to Norway after we were married.

703
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I've been there a couple of times on sabbatical leaves afterward.

704
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And one of these cases, he invited us to dinner.

705
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
We had a magnificent dinner at his house.

706
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It was all catered.

707
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
He had ordered it in from the catering outfit.

708
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I think I say yes, actually.

709
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
We're running a catering outfit.

710
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And we had a very pleasant evening at Hussle's house.

711
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So...

712
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
The people didn't get to that TV level were calling very often.

713
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Pardon?

714
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
The people didn't get to the TV level were calling very often.

715
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Not very often.

716
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It's a little hard to tell.

717
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I was kind of one way, as I said, you know.

718
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
He always shook hands and said,

719
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
said, how's Lisa doing?

720
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And he would ask me about her all sorts of things.

721
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
He would call me Ken, but I...

722
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I never felt that he relished me calling him Linus.

723
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And everybody had that feeling.

724
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I know...

725
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
He visited here when Earl Gilbert was chairman in the live.

726
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And Gilbert referred to him as Linus.

727
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
They talked to one another on that basis.

728
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But I don't think Gilbert had really met him before.

729
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I just don't know him.

730
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
The point is that apparently he had a swing ball that was playing popular that day.

731
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yes.

732
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I haven't talked about that, have I?

733
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Well, no, well.

734
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Here is a couple of incidents surrounding this woman, cool.

735
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I was asked by the Paulings with my then first wife

736
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
to babysit the children while they were off on a trip.

737
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
The children were Peter, Linda, and Krillin.

738
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And they were early, early teens.

739
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And Linus had finished and gone off to medical training

740
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
was off in Linus, Jr., in Hawaii.

741
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And so we weren't required to do anything that kids ought to go

742
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
to school and so on.

743
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
We were supposed to be there in the evenings,

744
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
make sure that they were all there and so on.

745
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And so we did that.

746
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And they had this swimming pool.

747
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Paulings' house had two wings that came together like this.

748
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And people were fond of saying, I'm not sure whether it's true or not,

749
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
but the angle between the wings was 109 degrees in 28 minutes,

750
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
which is, of course, the angle, the tetrahedral bond angle.

751
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't know whether that story is true or not,

752
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
but it certainly was very close to it.

753
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Well, down in the, a little below,

754
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
the house was built slightly up and down below.

755
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
They had this swimming pool.

756
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And the Pauling kids, when their parents were away,

757
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
were on the habit of going around the chemistry department,

758
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
inviting everybody up to a big party in this swimming pool.

759
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And I remember this happening one time.

760
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
The pool was full of people and the Paulings showed up.

761
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And in a short while,

762
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Ava Hillin came out and said, Linda,

763
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
your father and I would like to take a swim.

764
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Can you get these people out of here?

765
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
There was a hush that fell over the group,

766
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and we vacated the premises very quickly.

767
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
One of the occasions when I was babysitting the kids,

768
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I heard a splash.

769
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
This is late at night.

770
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It was 11 o'clock and I'd actually gone to bed,

771
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
and the bedroom faced downhill.

772
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But I couldn't really see this swimming pool clearly.

773
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I think I saw some ripples in it.

774
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And I heard this splash.

775
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And I wondered what the hell that was.

776
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But anyway, I didn't bother to go out and check and so on.

777
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And the next day, there was no sign of anything awry.

778
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And on the second day,

779
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I also heard this splash in the pool.

780
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And again, I did nothing about it.

781
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
But in the morning, I got up and I went into the kitchen

782
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
and made my breakfast,

783
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
and there was a strange man standing there in the kitchen,

784
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
making breakfast.

785
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And this was a guy.

786
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Again, the name is hard for me to come by,

787
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
but a long standing friend of the Paulings and Paulings

788
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
has mentioned it by name from the University of Texas.

789
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And I guess they'd asked him if he'd like to stay there.

790
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Well, pardon me.

791
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah, that's right, Jeffress.

792
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So we introduced ourselves to each other.

793
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It turned out we'd been living in this house,

794
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
both of us for three days.

795
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And this was the first time our paths had crossed.

796
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I usually got up early and so did my then wife.

797
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
She went to work and I went to Caltech,

798
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
and he apparently was on vacation, came up later.

799
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So we've been living for three days.

800
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It's almost the third day that I met this guy in the same house.

801
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Lloyd Jeffress, that's right.

802
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So that was the swimming pool.

803
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
What do you recall about the children's personality?

804
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, Peter.

805
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Very, very vivacious.

806
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And Linda also.

807
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Unless so he was younger, quite a bit younger.

808
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Well, I don't know how much younger,

809
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
but at any rate,

810
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
the two older ones,

811
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
they were almost

812
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
unfettered.

813
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I mean, they were just

814
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
into everything in a good, humored way.

815
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Very vocal both of them.

816
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Many years later,

817
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I went to Lisa and I went to Europe.

818
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And Peter at that time had gotten the position

819
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
at the University of London, I guess it was.

820
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And I called him and he met us in a sports car.

821
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
By this time he had been pretty heavily in the alcohols

822
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
and big problems.

823
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
But at any rate,

824
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
he was enthralled with my wife, Lisa, you know,

825
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
and boy, he couldn't.

826
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
He was sidelining up to her all the time

827
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
and giving her all sorts of compliments.

828
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
She was laughing at him most of the time.

829
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Peter had trouble with,

830
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I think he had been divorced once,

831
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and I don't remember any details

832
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
of his life, I only knew at the end

833
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
that he was totally

834
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
incompetent and he had gone to Wales

835
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and was living in a small house

836
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
that I got a phone call from in a couple of times

837
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and Yale asking me about

838
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
certain events in his father's life

839
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
as a fellow named Herman Branson

840
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
had given pulling some problems

841
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
regarding priority and discovery or ideas

842
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
and so on.

843
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Peter had called me,

844
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I knew Herman Branson,

845
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
well, I knew anything about this

846
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and I didn't.

847
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Well, Linda,

848
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I don't know a great deal about her life

849
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
how she went to college,

850
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
what she did, I know.

851
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
She met Barclay when Barclay was a student at Caltech.

852
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Pulling was very impressed by Barclay.

853
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I remember one occasion on a party when I was up there.

854
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
He was asking Barclay some questions

855
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and Barclay was answering them

856
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I guess he was he decided that he was

857
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,000
the guy for his daughter.

858
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Again, that's just my

859
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
my reaction about it.

860
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Barclay was a nice guy

861
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
of course he lived in Pasadena

862
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
and after we came to Corralis we didn't see them very much

863
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
but Barclay used to make an annual

864
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
trip up to his glacier in Alaska

865
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
he was doing measurements on glacial flow

866
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and so on.

867
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And one time they stopped by

868
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
and they stayed overnight with us

869
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
at a very pleasant evening

870
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and Barclay could play the piano quite well

871
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
and so he enjoyed sitting at our piano

872
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
and playing it during the evenings.

873
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And afterwards Linda asked her

874
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
a father for something that

875
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
she could give to these and me

876
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
as a token of appreciation

877
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and I have a picture

878
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
of pulling together

879
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
with

880
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
the whole of the famous South African doctor

881
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Dr.

882
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yeah, Albert's fight set.

883
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
We're both of them in the picture

884
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
and that was sent to me by Linda.

885
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Well, we'd like back on this period

886
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
of Caltech it's called the Golden Age of Caltech

887
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
and I guess just been kind of closing

888
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
to what does that mean to you

889
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
that this period of the Golden Age of Caltech?

890
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Well, I guess it's

891
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
probably termed because it was

892
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
you know I was asked to give a lecture

893
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
a banquet talk one time at a meeting

894
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
symposium in Texas

895
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and the topic suggested to me

896
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
was the Golden Age at Caltech.

897
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
That was a title of the talk

898
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
so I dredged through all the archives

899
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and found out quite a lot

900
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
of various people and things.

901
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
But the Golden Age was the age

902
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
of all this marvelous stuff

903
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
that Pauling was doing in chemistry

904
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
and people like Feynman

905
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and others were doing in physics

906
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and it was an environment

907
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
that couldn't be more exciting

908
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
to a young student

909
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
because you could almost literally

910
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
hear a lecture each week

911
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
by a Nobel Prize winner

912
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and some subject or another visitors.

913
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I mean I've heard lectures

914
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
from people like Fermi

915
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
who came from Argonne.

916
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I've attended lectures

917
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
by Feynman, Carl Anderson

918
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
was there, I've heard lectures by him

919
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and I've heard lectures

920
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
by people in chemistry

921
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
who came through.

922
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So all this appeared

923
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
when I was a student

924
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and at the same time we knew

925
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
there was a very active program

926
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
and X-ray crystallography

927
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
going on devoted to providing Pauling

928
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I'm quite sure with the

929
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
fundamentals of structure

930
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
that would enable him,

931
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
finally, to formulate the alpha helix.

932
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
They published seven papers, you know,

933
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
that's one of them's alpha helix

934
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
that's the famous one

935
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and there's a pleated sheet

936
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and a number of other things

937
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that they published at that time.

938
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So all of this was going on

939
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and we knew it

940
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
and when Pauling finally unveiled

941
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
his alpha helix,

942
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I remember that was a lecture

943
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:55,000
of some showmanship

944
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
and I told you about that,

945
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
no doubt.

946
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Celtic built these space-filling models.

947
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
You have some of them here

948
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
in a special collection

949
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
of the alpha helix, actually I think.

950
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And I think it was that same model

951
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
which was about this high

952
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
and it's got red, white

953
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
and black atoms

954
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
all distributed through it,

955
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
representing the various elements.

956
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
You started to give a lecture on this

957
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and this thing was in the middle of the room

958
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
but it was covered with a tall paper bag.

959
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So he was going to describe the structure, you know

960
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
and as he went on people's curiosity

961
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
they were getting more and more in the edge of his sheets.

962
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And he walked over and he pulled this thing up

963
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
just a little about that far

964
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and he put it down and he says,

965
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
oh he said I forgot to

966
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
and then people sort of twittered.

967
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
He did that once more, you know,

968
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
when people laughed

969
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and the third time

970
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
he took it off and showed it was

971
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
everybody applauded, you see.

972
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
He was a great showman in that respect.

973
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I remember, by the way,

974
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
a lecture he gave

975
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
in quantum mechanics.

976
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I took of course in quantum mechanics from him.

977
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
The room was quite full of students.

978
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
He walked in one time,

979
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
he carried a big book

980
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
which was

981
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
the nature, I'm sorry,

982
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
an introduction to quantum mechanics

983
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
by him and Brian Wilson.

984
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And the normal copy is about that thick

985
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
but this is about that thick

986
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
and it turns out that

987
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
every facing page was blank

988
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
so he could write notes in it

989
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and he would lecture from this.

990
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
He would come in.

991
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Well one day he walked in

992
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and as he got inside there was a

993
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
the room was very wide

994
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
and had blackboards.

995
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
They were blackboards in those days

996
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
from one end to the other.

997
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
He walked in and he

998
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
picked up a piece of chalk

999
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
and there were three panels here.

1000
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
He wrote on the upper left end corner

1001
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
N-O-2,

1002
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
nitrogen dioxide.

1003
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Without saying a word,

1004
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
he went across, he began to lecture

1005
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
and he filled up the board

1006
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
over here

1007
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and continues lecture,

1008
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
filled up the board over here

1009
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and as he got to the bottom

1010
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
he had reached the point where he says,

1011
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
now you take an N-O-2 molecule

1012
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and he pointed to what he had already put on the chair.

1013
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
People the whole hour were wondering

1014
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
what was going to happen

1015
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
but he had it at the precise location

1016
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
where he needed an illustration

1017
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
for what he had been talking about

1018
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
and they had it already written up there.

1019
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That's the kind of subtle humor

1020
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,000
that he used to impress the students.

1021
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
He gave lectures to the undergraduates too

1022
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
and a lot of the undergraduates

1023
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
were a little bit unhappy with this.

1024
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
The better ones were not.

1025
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
The graduate teaching assistants

1026
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
of which I was one

1027
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
when I first came there

1028
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
were delighted with these lectures

1029
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
because they were what they were looking for.

1030
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But the students,

1031
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
he wouldn't pick out topics in the book

1032
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
and talk about them,

1033
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
the book's book for itself.

1034
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But he would talk about things

1035
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
associated with them

1036
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and that were involved at perhaps

1037
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
at the cutting level of research

1038
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
and he would talk about this

1039
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
and that kind of disappointed a lot of the students

1040
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
who wanted more explanation

1041
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
of what they were reading in the textbook.

1042
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Anyway, as TAs,

1043
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
we all like the lectures very much.

1044
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Well, is there anything else

1045
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
about the Caltech years that we should talk about?

1046
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't know.

1047
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
We've talked about a lot of the personalities there.

1048
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
There were a lot of people

1049
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I haven't mentioned that figured prominently.

1050
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
For example, Jerry Donahue

1051
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
is a distinguished crystallographer

1052
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
and he happened to be

1053
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:28,000
in England in the same laboratory

1054
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
where Watson and Crick were.

1055
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And he is said to have

1056
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
made a key observation to them

1057
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
about the configuration

1058
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
that played a big role

1059
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and they're eventually

1060
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
coming to the right structure for DNA.

1061
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There were other personalities

1062
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I haven't mentioned in chemistry.

1063
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
There were all sorts of names

1064
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
that run by,

1065
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
but I don't have anything particular to say about them.

1066
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I did some work with a guy named Werner Navaki

1067
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
from Switzerland.

1068
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
He was a very, very impressive man

1069
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
named Edgar Halbrenner.

1070
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You know that name?

1071
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Edgar came to Caltech also.

1072
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
He was Swiss.

1073
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I think he was a Jew

1074
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
that left Germany and had gone to Switzerland

1075
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
just ahead of the Nazis

1076
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
and he was a superb scientist.

1077
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
He had a wonderful sense of humor

1078
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
and he taught me

1079
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
in my life how to make cheese fondue

1080
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
and he became very,

1081
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
went back to Switzerland,

1082
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
rose to the ranks,

1083
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
became a distinguished professor

1084
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and went to Basel.

1085
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
He and Jack Dunnets were very close

1086
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
as families,

1087
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
so they had apartments

1088
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
just a couple of doors away from each other.

1089
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Edgar died a few years ago

1090
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and I had written to him

1091
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
when I knew that he was ill

1092
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and I got a very nice letter back from him.

1093
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And a year and a half later

1094
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I was going to write a game

1095
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and then a fellow named

1096
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Ishin Moser showed up

1097
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
to give a lecture in chemistry

1098
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and I knew Ishin Moser.

1099
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I'd given a lecture in Zurich

1100
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and Halbrenner always spoke

1101
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
very highly of Ishin Moser.

1102
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
So I said,

1103
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
how was Edgar?

1104
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
He said, oh he died.

1105
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I was shocked.

1106
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I'm absolutely shocked.

1107
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And so I talked to Jack Dunnets

1108
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
about this running letter

1109
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
so I hadn't heard at all.

1110
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
He said, he apologized objectively

1111
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
for not having let me know.

1112
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But then he said at the end,

1113
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Edgar became very discouraged

1114
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
about something he had

1115
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
lost a leg in an accident.

1116
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
You probably know all about that.

1117
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh.

1118
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Well, I'll tell you that in a minute.

1119
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But he came very discouraged

1120
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
and he was in the hospital

1121
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and out and finally,

1122
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
according to Jack,

1123
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
it appears as if he just

1124
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
gave up and he died

1125
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
in the hospital.

1126
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And in spite of him being

1127
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
very, very close to families,

1128
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I said, well, how is Ruth doing?

1129
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
That said, to her life.

1130
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
He says, I don't know.

1131
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
He says it's amazing

1132
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
because she retreated

1133
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
into herself and has occupied herself

1134
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
solely with her children

1135
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
and grandchildren.

1136
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
We haven't ever heard a word from her.

1137
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And he was terribly surprised

1138
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
because they were very close

1139
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
and she was an open,

1140
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
friendly woman with a great sense of humor.

1141
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And maybe it just struck her so hard

1142
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
that she didn't want to have any connection

1143
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
with the past at all.

1144
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I wrote her a letter

1145
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and I never had a response

1146
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
offering my condolences

1147
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
that Edgar

1148
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:22,000
was a very athletic guy,

1149
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
particularly in a rowing.

1150
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
He was a single-score guy.

1151
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
He wrote on the lake in Zurich

1152
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
but he was a budding scientist

1153
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and he told me all this.

1154
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
He had been out on the town

1155
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
of these girlfriend

1156
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and they had come by the house

1157
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
where he lived.

1158
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It was an apartment up here

1159
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
on this hill

1160
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
when the tram came down like this.

1161
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
One of these brand new Swiss trams,

1162
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
you know,

1163
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
that have all sorts of safety features on it.

1164
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
He was standing waiting for the tram

1165
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
after having run upstairs

1166
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
to see whether the article he had been

1167
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
had been accepted had been published

1168
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
and he was looking at a journal, you see.

1169
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It had not been

1170
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
and he came back down

1171
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and he was standing on the platform

1172
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
with his then girlfriend.

1173
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And this tram came down the hill

1174
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
of the high rate of speed out of control

1175
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and tipped over like this.

1176
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I don't know whether his companion survived that

1177
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
and Ruth was not she.

1178
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I think that's true.

1179
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I think she was killed.

1180
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But at any rate,

1181
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
his body went through a window of the tram

1182
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
but one leg was trapped underneath

1183
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
and they had to amputate it.

1184
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
So when I met him,

1185
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
he was using a cane

1186
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
in the antipocytic device.

1187
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
He didn't use crutches.

1188
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
But he was brilliant

1189
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
at all sorts of alerts in Switzerland

1190
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
for his science later on.

1191
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It's hard for me to think about these people

1192
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
and knowing them as I did

1193
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
and then thinking about

1194
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
what would have happened to them

1195
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
bad.

1196
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
So that's about all I can tell you

1197
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
there are many, many minor details

1198
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
but those are the highlights.

1199
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Not at all.

1200
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Okay.

1201
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Well, we will go ahead for today.

1202
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Okay, you want to do more of this?

1203
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Yes.

1204
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Okay.
