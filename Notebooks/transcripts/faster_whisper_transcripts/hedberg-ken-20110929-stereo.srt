1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So there's still questions you want to ask me.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are, yes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Just like last time, go ahead and introduce this off.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The name is Dave.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, yes.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Kenneth Hedberg.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the 29th of September of 2011.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So last time we pretty much finished up with Caltech.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But one thing I realized I forgot to ask you about.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Was any memories you have of baby Helen from that time, too?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, baby Helen?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Only peripherally because I saw her together with her husband fairly frequently.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Excuse me.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And she, of course, was always present at the open houses that they held occasionally.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
These open houses, some of the faculty and so on were invited not very many of the students.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I saw her there.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I saw her a lot, of course, later on when she and Linus came to Oregon State.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But at the time that I was at Caltech, I saw her with Linus a great deal.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And that's about all.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When did you make the move to OSU and what made you decide to make that move?

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When did I come to OSU or what?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, I don't know.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Have I mentioned it all the circumstances under which I experienced the opening here at Oregon State?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, no, no.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, well, I had been working at Caltech for many years after my doctorate.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And, well, many, five or six.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I was actively engaged in research and I was stopped in the hole one day by Carl Neiman,

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
who was a distinguished organic chemist and whom I knew quite well.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He said, can I receive the letter from a former colleague of mine?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A man I went to graduate school with with Wisconsin, who was now at Oregon State.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And he said, they have an opening there.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And he wondered whether I had anybody who would be interested or we here at Caltech,

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
if anybody who might be interested.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I just thought I'd mention it to you in passing because I remember you were in Oregon State undergrad.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, at this time, my wife was pretty unhappy in California and Macedonia because of the air pollution.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Our first son was about to be born and she wanted to raise him in that environment.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I said, yes, I'd better explore this.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And so I wrote them to E.C. Gilbert, who wrote back, indeed, they did have an opening.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And one thing followed another and it turned out that my wife and I were going to drive North to Oregon to visit my parents,

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
who lived at that time in Astoria.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I said to Gilbert that I would stop on route and talk with him and members of the faculty and discuss the opening.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Then I got another letter from a guy named Bill Colville, William E. Colville,

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
who let me know in no uncertain terms that the reason this was a job was because he had managed to get the president of the University of A.L. Strand

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to commit to two new faculty hires in chemistry.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And it turns out that at that time, well, let me put it this way, Earl Gilbert and Bill Colville were not on the best of terms.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Gilbert was a department chairman and Colville was a professor who did almost, did no research on sight,

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but had some mining claims and other things.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And it was kind of an open, free-handed, back-slopping type, a member of the country club and a new E.L. Strand fairly well.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And he complained that the freshman at Oregon State and incoming students were not being given proper instruction because there weren't enough professional staff involved in this, just graduate teaching assistants and so on.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And he managed to convince Strand that perhaps there should be some positions set up.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And these would people, of course, would be nominally responsible to Colville since he was running the whole program.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the main purpose of the main task of these people were going to be that they would sort of ride herd on all the teaching assistants.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So they would patrol the laboratories, make sure that the teaching assistants were doing their job.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They would, of course, have some responsibilities themselves, bought in the freshman program.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They would hold recitations and they would be in this way and be responsible for laboratories and then, as I mentioned, patrol the laboratories regularly.

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I immediately sensed that there was something, there was a bit of an adversarial relationship between Gilbert and Colville.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And Gilbert, of course, was interested in hiring somebody who could also increase the research potential of the faculty.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Colville wasn't in the least interested in whether these guys could do any research or not.

61
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He just wanted them as sort of major domos.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And so I learned all of this in more detail when I came and talked with Gilbert and talked with Colville.

63
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I also had numerous conversations with other members of the faculty, people who have passed on now, Tom Nauros, Wendell Slavell, everybody that was on the faculty that I had known before.

64
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And after concluding all these interviews, we drove on down to my terrace, came back to California.

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I had told Gilbert it was still a guy who was officially in charge of the hiring that I would think it over and I'd let him know.

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So after I got back to Pasadena, I felt for a long time about this, and decided that the conditions of this job were such that I found it unlikely to be able to get my research program going at Oregon State in a reasonable length of time, so I declined the offer, which was $5,500 for nine months.

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, no, nine months, but spread over 10 months.

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, my wife was very unhappy about this because she liked Oregon more like Oslo, where she grew up in Norway.

69
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:32,000
As she put it, there was so water in the rivers of Pinarigan and trees in the forest where she couldn't see that in LA.

70
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We drove across a bridge, one place, and I pointed out that this was the San Gabriel River. She looked down, there was no water, it was just a dry wash.

71
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And we went through the San Gabriel forest on the outskirts, so that there's nothing but sagebrush, that's the source of her comments.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
At any rate, she was very unhappy about this. And a few days later, I got a call from Gilbert saying he was very sorry to receive my letter.

73
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He had very much hoped that I would accept the job. And he said he wondered if they were able to increase the starting, so I'll read a little bit what I reconsider.

74
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And I said at this time, the home life was a little frosty because at least it was so disappointed. So I said, okay, I'll do that.

75
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Have I told you any of this at all? No, okay.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So the offer came back and he said we can pay you two or three hundred dollars more per year. That's maybe five percent or six percent increase.

77
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And so I asked Paul what he thought about all this. And he invited me to come up to his home one evening after hours, five o'clock or so.

78
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can't remember exactly, so I went up to 4,500 per point, whatever the street number is, or yeah, he's Allison, he's out on the Miranda and discussed the job.

79
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've been very active in research at Caltech, and had a number of published papers, lots of things going, and I expressed to him my fear that I was not going to be able to get my research program going at Oregon State because it involved the construction of apparatus.

80
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You saw that apparatus. I had to build that by hand. There were extremely limited machine shop facilities, nothing in the chemistry department at all.

81
00:10:44,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I didn't see how I could get that instrument built at Oregon State. So I expressed all this to him and then told him that the actual number of hours that I was expected to be in contact with students

82
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:20,000
was something like 15 or 16 hours a week, just in the hands-on contact. That's about 30 percent, or a little bit more than that, 35 percent of the total time, not counting preparation or anything.

83
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Anne Pauling, sort of lean back in his chair, we were sitting side by side looking out over the valley and the swimming pool.

84
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He said, well, he said, I don't know. He says 15 hours. He said, when I was at Oregon State, I was teaching 40 hours a week.

85
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That was the year that he was a sophomore and had been asked to handle a course for young women in home economics.

86
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think at those who were taking chemistry as a requirement, that's where he met his wife A. The Helen. But anyway, that's the story, you know.

87
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So anyhow, he said 40 hours. He said, I don't know. He said, I think that Oregon State will not be a first-class institution for research in my time. And probably not on yours. These are his words.

88
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He said, on the other hand, that's not really important in a bigger sense. He said, if you didn't get your program going, these will be very happy there. Oregon is a wonderful place to live, as you and I know.

89
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He said, I don't know. I think it might be worthwhile giving a chance. I think you could make it go on. You'd be very happy there.

90
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So with that encouragement, I told Gilbert up and said, yes, I would accept the offer. And my wife, of course, was delighted at this because at this time our son had just been born.

91
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And we lived in Pasadena, down below, not far from Caltech. And the smog would roll in the morning, about 11 o'clock. And she'd take the baby in, close all the doors and windows.

92
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Keep them closed till about four in the afternoon when the winds reverse their direction and swept all the smog back out to sea again. And she could open things up.

93
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was pretty hot, too. So I had a hose in this garden cottage that I put on the root and turned on the water to keep it cool during the time that she was so to speak incarcerated.

94
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Anyway, that fall, I told Gilbert that I wouldn't be able to come in the fall by the fall term, but I could come January 1st.

95
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This was January 1st, was 1956. So this was all in 1955. This conversation went on.

96
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I had come January, we drove north after Christmas in times of a huge storm that actually led to flooding. This was a fine way for my wife to be introduced to the worst vertical of Alice.

97
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You don't know anything today about how it was then, but we drove up to Eugene, got the junction city, and it turned out that the 99 West was closed because of water and the roads.

98
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But there was a bus going up 99 East to Albany and I, with our car, the baby in the back, and we followed this bus very carefully up sometimes.

99
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The water almost up to the hubcaps of the car got to Albany. And then it turned out that the road from Albany to Corvallas was okay.

100
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It wasn't underwater yet, but the road from Corvallas South on 99 West was underwater. So by that we managed to get to Corvallas, and by three arrangements we had run out of the house of a faculty member that was going to be away for three months.

101
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So we had a place to move into immediately, all furnished, very nice house on Chintimini, over there against the hill and south. Well, you know where it is.

102
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It was very nice. And it turned out that everything was flooded the following day or two in Corvallas. You could hardly get around at all. And then it turned cold later on, snow came and so on.

103
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So that was my introduction to Corvallas. I showed up to work on one of the early days and Gilbert told me, oh, they had a kind of a bonus to give me.

104
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And that was that I was going to be assigned to teach a graduate course and physical chemistry to organically and others.

105
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, this sounded like a bonus to him, but for somebody just coming there, I mean this was a lecture thrill or as a week and I had never done this course before. So I had all those lectures to prepare as well as stuff I was expected to do under Bill Coldwell's regime.

106
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So I had a very, very busy time and with a newborn in the house of my wife, you know, trying hard to the customer's self to life in a new place with a new baby in a husband who was up to his ears and work wasn't very easy.

107
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was pretty discouraged at the end of that term. And as the term drew on, I took care to write down on a piece of paper divided into days and hours of the day for a week each week.

108
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How much time I was actually spending in duties connected with teaching by connected with that man in the in with students one on one preparation, including evening hours and everything else.

109
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I was averaging that first term, 56 hours a week, only in teaching related duties. And so my fear is about getting my program started on the research side. Well, well born out by that first experience.

110
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And of course, I was expected not only to have a program going, getting my research going, but I had to build this apparatus, which meant that I had to design it, sit down with, I think I showed you just briefly, folders with those drawings in there.

111
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I had a drawing table in my office. And so I spent a lot of time with drawing these things. And then Professor Youngter and Physics had a fine physics shop. And I went across to see him and he agreed, you see my life actually, to allow one of the people in physics.

112
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Physics, I think they had three or four machinists who would be assigned to my job. And he would do everything and he and I would be in one to one contact all the time.

113
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He reserved the right to retake this man off for any projects that physics needed, of course, since he was employed by physics and using the physics facilities.

114
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And that worked out just beautifully. Took a long time to get the apparatus built three or four years, but it was finally done and put together and we managed to make it go.

115
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So Ed Youngter's facilities and his kindness really are responsible for getting me off the ground at Oregon State.

116
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So would describe the apparatus a little bit for me.

117
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Sorry. Describe the apparatus for me.

118
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, well, the apparatus is what is called an electron diffraction unit.

119
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It consists of a, the essential feature of it is an electron gun that will produce a well-colonated beam of electrons at the potential of about 60 kiloboles.

120
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a very energetic beam on the scale of the way chemistry operates.

121
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That beam is admitted into a large vacuum chamber.

122
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
In my apparatus, the whole thing is mounted vertically, so the beam comes down into this vacuum chamber.

123
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And at the bottom of the beam, let's say, is a detecting beam, which is in my case, photographic film.

124
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
In those days, there's a photographic plate, but it's no photographic film.

125
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And this photographic film is eight by ten inches square and is perpendicular to the beam and is moved into position by mechanism that I built into the apparatus.

126
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And the apparatus is designed to study the structures of molecules in the gas phase by diffracting this beam of electrons from them.

127
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So we have a long nozzle that protrudes into the apparatus with a tip that passes that stops just about a millimeter short of where there's very fine high-powered electron beam is coming down.

128
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Now, if in this nozzle, which is a two with a fine tip on it, you admit a gas into the chamber, the gas shoots out the nozzle tip, intersects the electron beam at right angles and produces what is called a diffraction pattern.

129
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This diffraction pattern consists of what happens is, of course, it's recorded on this photographic film at the underneath the nozzle.

130
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And perpendicular to the beam.

131
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So the diffraction pattern is recorded on this in a set of diffuse rings of varying intensity.

132
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And the spacing of these rings and their shapes of the pattern contain all the structural information about the length of the interatomic distances in the molecule.

133
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And so we take these patterns and we analyze them and out of that we can deduce the intimate details of the structures of these molecules in the gas phase.

134
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That is essentially, it's a structure of a single molecule because so far apart, they don't interact with one another as they shoot into the apparatus.

135
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And so that's what I was charged with or what I wanted to build and which I finally got going for all those years.

136
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's still running and running.

137
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah, and it is running and right now and running beautifully, we just did an experiment last week, beautiful patterns we got for a new molecule or interested in.

138
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It doesn't take long for the experiment as quite interesting. The technique is developed enormously since the days when I first entered the field at Caltech as a graduate student.

139
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And now the experiment that lasts is diffraction pattern. You expose the photographic film to the diffraction pattern for only two or three minutes and you might want to make five different films or ten different films.

140
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So all tools you can do the entire experiment in a day if you push it, everything.

141
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And that's all the data you need for what might be for a graduate student a year and a half of work analyzing it.

142
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So the apparatus mostly sits unused because we can quickly gather all the data we knew.

143
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I've had a lot of visitors who have come, used the apparatus.

144
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And if I had a technician I could supply all the diffraction data for every group in the world.

145
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This technician did nothing but take diffraction pictures of substances involved.

146
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Now it may be a little more complicated because these are gas phase molecules. We admit them in the chamber as a gas.

147
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But that doesn't mean that they have to be a gas as you look at them. You can put them on the table.

148
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The factors you've got to get them into the gas phase in order to make this experiment work.

149
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Well, we have a set of ovens and heated nozzles so we can heat these things up and get the vapor.

150
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
C60 that we have worked on, of course, is very intractable, has no vapor pressure at all to speak of.

151
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So we had to heat this substance in an oven to 800 and some odd degrees Celsius in order to get the tiniest bit of vapor from it.

152
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But that was sufficient to give us the diffraction pattern and we were able to determine the structure of this material which is a carbon-like powder on the table.

153
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So we have all sorts of auxiliary apparatus which allows us to produce gas molecules from lots of different circumstances.

154
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So it works very nicely. I'm very happy with it.

155
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I should add as a post-cryptolist that this technique was very powerful through the 40s and 50s and 60s even in the 70s.

156
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But there are other techniques that have developed in the meantime too and so there are fewer laboratories in the world doing this work.

157
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:17,000
When I came to Oregon State and got mine going, there were about, there were only two laboratories in the United States.

158
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Did this kind of work? Mine and a laboratory at Michigan.

159
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
There were other people who, well there was another apparatus built.

160
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It didn't, it worked for a while but not very long.

161
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And there was one of Texas that was built similar to look.

162
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But it was built in the physics department and the interest there was not the same as the interest that chemists had.

163
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And so it worked for a while and then it stopped.

164
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And later on there were apparatuses in Britain.

165
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:14,000
There was one at Edinburgh. And later on, and still extant, is one in Reading, England.

166
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There was one in Germany, they were very active in Germany.

167
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And when I first started there was one in Belgium and one in Holland and several in at that time the Soviet Union.

168
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And two or three laboratories in Japan, all of them had apparatus and could do experiments.

169
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
All those were gone except the apparatus in Reading.

170
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The apparatus in Germany by the way, the man who was the professor who was in charge of that laboratory retired.

171
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
His name was Heinz Oberhummer.

172
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And his apparatus has been transferred to an inorganic chemist who is using it as kind of an exaggerate to his main work which is the preparation and interesting inorganic compounds.

173
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And as a part of that he wants to know what those structures are.

174
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The apparatus in Reading is still extant but the man who was in charge of it before has now retired.

175
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And a woman that was working with him has a permanent position at the university but she's heavily involved with teaching and has very little time to work with it.

176
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There were two important laboratories in Norway, I didn't mention them earlier.

177
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Both of them are now gone as far as apparatus is concerned.

178
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:11,000
There isn't any further support for it in that in science decisions are always made about where you're going to put a limit to the amount of phones.

179
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And in Norway it's now determined that this particular area of research will not be supported anymore by the university in the sense that they will hire technicians and professorial-ranked people to do this kind of work.

180
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I fear that will probably be the case here at Oregon State too.

181
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So we don't know.

182
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's a plain fact is it's not judged by what's going on in the world of chemistry today cutting-edge stuff.

183
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:04,000
A lot of the things that's going on today is shifted more into larger molecule biological things, synthetic organic chemistry, new materials, things of that sort and not the kind of basic science that I was involved with for all those years.

184
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So anyway I came to Oregon State, got a built and I've been here ever since doing this kind of research. That's what it's all about.

185
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's been great fun.

186
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So what were the techniques that you used to analyze the detection patterns initially?

187
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, yes that's a good question. I don't know how much of the technology I ought to go into.

188
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But essentially you're faced with this photographic film. If you hold it up to the light you see the beautiful pattern of circular rings of varying intensity, very diffuse, easily recognized going out from a central point.

189
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And all the information about the structure of the molecules contained as I said earlier in the spacings and the shapes of these rings.

190
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The question then you're really asking is how do you go from that to determine how molecules put together?

191
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, it turns out that these rings are related to the structure of the molecule by some, according to theory, by in a rather simple way.

192
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll keep it as simple as I possibly can.

193
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Every interatomic distance in the molecule creates an effect on this film, a pattern that consists of nothing more than a sine wave going from the middle out.

194
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Now a sine wave just goes up and down, up and down, up and down all the way out to the end of the photographic plate.

195
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So if you have a diagramic molecule, all the rings in their intensity would look like a sine wave.

196
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Just from the beginning, up, down, up, down, up, down, the spacing would be identical between them aside from some geometric factors that I don't have to go into.

197
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:16,000
All you have to do is to measure the frequency, oh, I should say that the farther apart the two atoms are that are giving rise to this sine wave, the greater the frequency of the sine wave.

198
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The two atoms that are far apart like this give a sine wave that goes up and down very rapidly, two atoms that are very close together will give a sine wave that has a very long wavelength.

199
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So you'll see very few rings.

200
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So all you'd have to do is to measure the spacing between these rings and that is related by theory to how far apart the atoms are.

201
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Well that's for a diatomic, let's say that's the case for a diatomic molecule. You only have one sine wave.

202
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The diatomic molecule vibrates and so the atoms are not rigid, they're moving back and forth away from one another like two balls on a spring.

203
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And of course that means that the distance isn't constant. Well it turns out according to theory to a good approximation, this sine wave instead of having constant amplitude all the way up dies off due to this vibration.

204
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So you measure the dying off of the sine wave and that tells you how big the amplitude of this vibration is.

205
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So we learn about two things, the distances between the atoms on the average and we learn about how much they're moving with respect to one another by measuring the damping off of the sine wave.

206
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Well of course there aren't many diatomic molecules left to study but every that problem or rather the theory that I mentioned applies to just the pairs of atoms.

207
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So if you have a molecule that has more than just two atoms in it you're going to have more than two distances, more than one distance.

208
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Every pair of atoms in the molecule gives rise to one of these sine waves. So carbon dioxide as a linear molecule is a carbon oxygen bond and that gives rise to a single sine wave that goes out.

209
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
There are two of them but they have exactly the same distance so there are two sine waves that are right on top of one another.

210
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Then you have the distance between the oxygen atoms and that's twice as big. So it generates a sine wave also which has a frequency twice as great to first approximation as the frequency of the carbon oxygen because the distance is twice as long.

211
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And that gives a sine wave that oscillates with twice the frequency and the first one and they're on top of one another.

212
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So the pattern is no longer a simple sine wave but a collection of two sine waves. If you know how to separate out these sine waves and measure their frequencies then you know exactly what the structure of this molecule is.

213
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So CO2 were bent like NO2 is, NO2 would be entirely similar but there you would find the distances between the oxygen atoms, the distance between the oxygen atoms is not twice the distance between the nitrogen and oxygen because it's a triangular molecule like this.

214
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So oxygen-oxygen distance would not be moving twice the frequency of the NO but less than that.

215
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So you can immediately determine that distance and determine the nitrogen-oxygen distance and by comparing them you know what the bond angle is in the molecule.

216
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This simple account can be applied to molecules that are very, very complicated. The entire problem man is just to separate out what these different sine waves are, construct yourself a model that will account for all of the distances and then you have the structure of the molecule.

217
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It is in practice considerably more complicated than I'm telling you but that's essentially the features of the whole thing.

218
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Now you ask how we do this. Well we have to measure the frequencies and to do that we have a scanner, what is called a microdensitometer.

219
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The film is placed on the bed of this microdensitometer and the film in the apparatus that I have, we have a mechanism that rotates the film around its center.

220
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:13,000
The purpose of this is that you are averaging the information around the entire circle that is if the densitometer consists of a beam that passes through the film and a detector that measures how intense the light beam is as it comes through the film.

221
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So when the ring is intense the light beam that comes through is much reduced and when the film is very more transparent the beam that comes through there is more intense.

222
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So you get a recording of the blackness of the film. So this thing translates and we have electronic data accumulation system that measures the intensity of the blackness of the film as a function from the center outward.

223
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And that gives us digital data and that's what we actually work with to analyze. So that's essentially it and without having you in the laboratory for a week I can't tell you much more that when I get clear here I don't think.

224
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So any other questions about that?

225
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This largely comes from your own interest or in my case my own interest let's say or the principal investigator's interest.

226
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Now if we take C60 for example that was big news at the time it was discovered and I had a former student named Bob Johnson who was working at IBM.

227
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:03,000
In San Jose and they had managed to create or had a sample of this stuff. Now in the beginning it was very rare.

228
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I mean a few well you could get it in in milligram quantities.

229
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I the sample that I actually worked with I think had 300 milligrams in it and it was a little bit of black powder in a vial.

230
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And at going market prices that was $5,000 worth of sample. Well Bob wrote to me and he asked me how could we do this could you do this work.

231
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know what very exciting we should try. And so they supplied the sample. Several people in IBM and were involved in this project and leasing me up here.

232
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And so we got the sample and we managed to it was very exciting because I didn't know whether we were going to be able to get a pattern from this stuff at all because it was so refractory.

233
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You know we had to heat it so hot and the oven that we had it was so hot it was going red in the apparatus.

234
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Now fortunately the film that we use is not very sensitive to red light. Secondly I was able to build a shield around the novel that protected the film from almost all of the glow.

235
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:51,000
As I heated it up I could see it glowing bright red in there and then I would close up the window to the apparatus and turn off the beam, lecture on beam and quickly move the plate in position.

236
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Open up the beam and expose this. I could not see evidence of any we have a fluorescent screen in there that we can see patterns on for most molecules.

237
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:17,000
At the time we did the experiment I couldn't see anything on this fluorescent screen other than a very faint glow from the screen so I didn't know whether we were getting anything or not.

238
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And so we made two or three of these exposures and I took the film into the dark room and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how beautiful a pattern was.

239
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You couldn't have predicted it would be like that or that you would even get one from seeing there was no evidence. Normally when I run stuff on the apparatus I put the main beam through a slot on a fluorescent screen so I can see the scattering all around it.

240
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And I can see it you know just it'll look like this on a black thing somewhat reduced. I can see we're getting scattering couldn't see that with C60 and yet there it was and absolutely beautiful pattern.

241
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It was very exciting.

242
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Was it what? Well it turns out Bucky balls if you pick up a soccer ball and you look to see how the things are put together there are hexagons in it and pentagons in it.

243
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And they are put together in a completely symmetric way and it turns out that in Bucky balls or on a soccer thing the length of the stitching in a soccer ball.

244
00:42:45,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's a little hard to describe but there are bonds that link two six member patches together and stitches that link a six member to a five member and those two bond links are different in C60 itself.

245
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Those are the only two parameters that are necessary to determine the structure of C60 assuming that it is a soccer ball. That's the assumption that you make and that was well characterized by NMR spectra and other things.

246
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So we knew it was a soccer ball type but we didn't know what the length of these bonds were.

247
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So if you then have the only thing that changes it doesn't change the shape it only changes the size of the six member and the five member ring as you change the length of these bonds.

248
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, we had to put together a model that is to say that would you see what you actually do in analysis you have the experimental pattern and then you have to generate a model

249
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and compare the pattern that this model gives with the one that you experience experimentally.

250
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So you are fitting a model for which you have calculated a pattern.

251
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And you adjust that pattern to fit the experiment by changing the parameters of the model.

252
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So to make this applying this to C60 the pattern depends only on the relative lengths of those two distances that I mentioned.

253
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,000
The one between six member rings and the one between a six and a five member ring.

254
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And so my wife then put together the model and you can imagine it's not easy.

255
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You have to remember generate every distance in the molecule from just these two parameters.

256
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:29,000
There are 720 distances in the molecule and she constructed a program that would calculate this model for us.

257
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And that was the one we used and tested and that led finally to the fitting and the structure of the thing.

258
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And we published that in science a couple of decades ago now I guess.

259
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Very little lots of fun.

260
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I wanted to ask also about xenon hexafloid.

261
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Which one?

262
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, xenon hexafloid.

263
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,000
We never actually finished the structure of that thing because a friend of mine at the University of Michigan had done a very good job

264
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and he was in the head of us.

265
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We worked on other xenon compounds.

266
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We did xenon tetroxide which is four oxygen atoms arranged in the form of a tetrahedron around a xenon atom.

267
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And that was quite an experience because a very explosive compound.

268
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We had several minor explosions with it.

269
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We had to generate the compound on the apparatus by adding acid to a perzenate as it's called.

270
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
A compound which contains xenon but it's a salt.

271
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And we had to build an apparatus where we could tip this up slightly and add acid to this where upon the xenon tetroxide would be formed and could flow into our apparatus through our nozzle.

272
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But we several times the stuff in the gas phase is very unstable.

273
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:34,000
We had several times very minor explosions and minor in the sense that there was no danger to anybody involved here but it blew holes in our conducting line right away.

274
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So we had that happen several times.

275
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That's the only xenon compound that we actually finished the structure on xenon tetroxide.

276
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Were there other compounds there particularly memorable or rewind?

277
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Well, the ones that we've talked about are one sort of in the public eye.

278
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I think in terms of public interest of something very novel probably not so much.

279
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:19,000
The work that we do I've always tended to characterize in the term used in the old days which is basic research.

280
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I had no really discernible practical applications but it was fundamental stuff and there are a lot of fundamental problems in chemistry.

281
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:48,000
For example, chemistry as it is practiced at some level or another makes continuous and intimate use of the concept of the structure of the things you're dealing with.

282
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I mean we talk about the structural proteins for example.

283
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We talk about the structure of almost everything in organic chemistry all structures when he lectures on the board.

284
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So we were involved in determining structures but what we were doing is actually measuring these structures to very high precision.

285
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
We're not just making a ball and stick drawing.

286
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We're looking at the distances between the atoms and trying to deduce from this.

287
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
How these distances might be related to the reactivity of the molecule and things of that sort.

288
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Now how the intimate details of the structure, distances, well let's me put it this way, size and shape of the molecule are related to its reactivity.

289
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I can give you one example of this that most people don't know about but a very common chemical compound in nature is nitrogen dioxide that comes from combustion of internal engines under high temperatures and so on.

290
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Nitrogen dioxide is a triangular molecule with a nitrogen at the apex and two of these nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide molecules come together and they form a dimer that has, it's called dionitrogen tetraxide then.

291
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Now a remarkable thing of this is that these two molecules come together and fall apart, come together and fall apart just so easily.

292
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:41,000
If you have N02 and the gas phase, you have N204 and the gas phase also as you change the temperature and pressure the amount of one of these with respect to the other changes.

293
00:50:41,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Well N204 is very hard to, it falls apart so easily, it's very hard to measure, the structure on it but we undertook that job.

294
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The way it was done is that we got a sample of N02 and the reaction for the decomposition or our dimerization or dimerization is extremely rapid, it just flows apart immediately or comes together immediately.

295
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We cool it down, the stream down, what happens is you get more and more of N204 as you heat it up, all of this is decomposed right away because of the thermal effects.

296
00:51:45,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So what we did was cool the oven, sorry the nozzle way, way down, well way down below zero Celsius, run the stuff through it and we got beautiful pictures of N204.

297
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Then we heated it up a little bit and we could see all the characteristic distances for that molecule beginning to disappear as if the higher we heated it, the less of those we had, we got it to 100 in some odd degrees, there's nothing but N02 present.

298
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Well the structure of N204 turned out to be very interesting, it turns out that there is an extraordinarily long N bond.

299
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:51,000
The bonds between atoms in typical compounds tend to be more or less the same, for example saturated hydrocarbons have carbon carbon bonds and I can tell you right away they will be 1.54 or 1.535 angstroms to within 100th of an angstrom and no matter what compound you look at.

300
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Well there's a characteristic N N bond, two N N O bonds and it turned out that this N N bond was very, very long.

301
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So much so that by a simple criterion that Linus Pauling had produced one time, it's only the order of a tenth as strong as a normal single bond.

302
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So that accounts for what follows the power very easily. But one thing that's characteristic of single bonds is that the two N's on the molecule can rotate around like this you see, they're not fixed like this because the bond is a weak to our intense surprise that's not the case of N204.

303
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's a flat planar molecule no matter how long this bond is.

304
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So what is it that holds the flat you see? Well that's not a single bond, don't hold things flat. Why is this flat? Well that was the interesting question of the time.

305
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And it turns out that the structure of the N O2 part of the N204 molecule is almost identically that of the separated N O2.

306
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That is bringing the two together to make the dime or doesn't change the structure of the ends at all.

307
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Normally if you bring them together, if you take two monomers and you bring them together, these will change somewhat in angles and distances, not within the N204.

308
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But these are puzzles that are just lots of fun to think about, that's all.

309
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And so this kind of research is the thing that's characterized what Lisa and I have done most of our career here.

310
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We have all sorts of different systems that pose different basic chemical questions.

311
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And we look at molecules to try to find out what we can learn about these basic chemical questions, answers to them from studying the structures of maybe even a series of several molecules that have other, some things in common, some things different to see how the differences and so on affect the properties of the molecules.

312
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So that's what we do.

313
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So you got your apparatus constructed, do I presume that your piece of wood decreased some?

314
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Well, in due course, and those days the chemistry department consisted of four divisions.

315
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
There was organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical. They were pretty clearly defined.

316
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
People were in these divisions in accordance with the kind of research they did.

317
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Well, they came in opening in physical chemistry.

318
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And Gilbert as chairman told me immediately that when that opening occurred, he was going to move me into that division.

319
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Well, this was two or three years later. The other, oh, but the two jobs were filled that this monitoring of the laboratories that brought me here.

320
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Caldwell's efforts.

321
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The other person was Tom Parsons. Tom Parsons was in chemistry for a while, but moved into administration and finished his career here as an administrator.

322
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Well, that I moved into physical chemistry, Gilbert, and I became a physical chemist of my teaching responsibility has changed a lot.

323
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I no longer rode herd on the TAs, but I still taught general chemistry, but I also began to teach courses regularly in physical chemistry.

324
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So, my contact hours went down, but the amount of time I spent working certainly didn't because now I had the contact hours before.

325
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I knew the experiments and freshmen chemistry the kids were doing, and I could walk through and make sure that they were getting a proper attention and so on.

326
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:20,000
But now I had to prepare lectures and in courses that I hadn't lectured in before.

327
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But the contact hours went down, but the amount of time spent teaching didn't diminish for quite a while.

328
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But nevertheless, my apparatus was coming along, and I was very lucky when I came here because I had all the money I needed to build this.

329
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I got some money from the research corporation before I arrived. I applied for that at Celtic, and I came with a Sloan Foundation grant, which was five years of money that I used for summer support, and I wasn't teaching, and then I could do fully to

330
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:11,000
drawing up parts from apparatus and so on. And then I got NSF support too, so I've never lacked for funding.

331
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The main thing that I've had trouble with is the time in the early days, not in the later days.

332
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So things have turned out later days that teaching loads gradually began to fall into a, oh, I don't want to put it, a race that was consistent with what we're being taught at other institutions with which we competed the time.

333
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:55,000
So there was still a lot of teaching, but it was a kind that there was really lots of fun.

334
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
What was the environment like in the department back then?

335
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, it was very collegial. Collegial was at the word. We were all very friendly with one another.

336
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I mean, socially, I had friends in physical chemistry and organic chemistry, and we saw one another at analytical chemistry at dinner parties, we did lots of things together.

337
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:39,000
New Year's Eve parties and so on. So it was, in my opinion, a lot more cohesive than it is at the moment.

338
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And at the time, a lot more cohesive at Oregon State than in many institutions. In many institutions, there is a kind of a very wary attitude or outlook

339
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,000
from one divisional type to another, and sometimes even within the members of the division,

340
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:21,000
you have to realize that university teaching, university careers can be very competitive, especially those that depend a good deal on research that you do as well as on your teaching.

341
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And so you read about this all the time of the press of people that are competing for even publicly sometimes for priority and some major discovery.

342
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But we never had any of that in chemistry. We just had a very good time. That's been a fine place.

343
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
At what point did Lisa start working at OSU?

344
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I'm sorry?

345
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
At what point did Lisa start working at OSU?

346
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh, that was a history that was very interesting.

347
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Lisa decided, did I mention how we met? Yeah, well, when we came to the stage, she was a scientist, and we worked together at Caltech.

348
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:24,000
She was actually paid at Caltech, and we worked in electron diffraction. They are both of us together in the same project.

349
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Did several things happen?

350
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Then when we came to Oregon, she was very busy, of course, with our son, who was only three months old when we arrived.

351
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So she didn't work at all at that point, except, well, that's not quite true, because we did manage to find some babysitting for a few hours a day now and then when she could come to the university.

352
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But she was never away from home, more than two or three hours at a time then.

353
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And that, a couple of years later, our daughter was born, so then we had two kids at home.

354
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And so by and large, she worked only sporadically until the kids got into nursery school when she could then drive them up.

355
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
They were on orchard street here in the university nursery school, which has changed its location, I think, somewhat.

356
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But the kids would go there, and she would come to the laboratory, and then when their sessions over, she'd take them up to go home.

357
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And we live very close to the Jefferson School, so until both of them got into school, she was home most of the time.

358
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But managed to put in several hours per week, working on our projects at that time.

359
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Then when the kids went to Jefferson School, she could in the morning, and the kids would get to rest, I'd go off to work.

360
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The kids would get to our school and start, they would run out the front door, go over to the school, and we'd let the teachers know what phone to call.

361
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Then Lisa would get into her car and drive over to the university and we would work until about two or three years so, when she would get in the car and go home, park the car and get in the house.

362
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:46,000
The kids would run out of the school and come back. They never knew she actually worked, because of course they were concerned she was there when they left and there when it came home.

363
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But she was able to work about half time then. She was paid by a line on them, a line on them in the budget for grants, as I had succeeded in getting.

364
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And then we also had joint grants. And then she's very good at mathematics and she was hired by the computer center to be working on, she was very good at programming and so on.

365
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And she was kind of a liaison with chemistry and programming in the computer center. That was when we still had centralized computing.

366
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Then we had one rhubarb. I might have told you this, but I haven't before, but it went something like this.

367
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Gilbert had retired and Bert Christensen had become chairman.

368
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And Lisa had been working on my grant for the line item and the budget for her salary.

369
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And the proposal that had been department chairman had to sign the proposal and Bert did that. And so it was funded.

370
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And then he decided one time that she could no longer work on the grant after her, after the present year was over academic year.

371
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And so she wrote him a letter and pointed out that she had item for a salary, was never explained what the reason was.

372
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And he responded and she wrote again and he didn't respond.

373
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It turned out in retrospect that he was greatly afraid that there would be some negative feeling about a man and wife working together

374
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:50,000
in the chemistry department, because at that time there was no one heard of, but it was a little unusual.

375
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The thing was, she was not being paid on state funds at all. And she was an expert in the field in which there were no other west of the Mississippi.

376
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Well, he persisted in this, so we finally went over to together to the dean who was Vern Scholoam at that time.

377
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And said, I knew him very well from years. I said, Vern, look, this is a situation.

378
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:33,000
He said, well, why didn't you tell me this before? I said, well, this Lisa said this too. Well, we were going through channels. Our issue was not with you with with Christensen.

379
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So he looked at this and he says, well, he says she can certainly work on the grant.

380
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:50,000
The proposal by the way had been signed by Bert and now he was refusing to continue on funding, even though he has signed the agreement.

381
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So he overturned this. But then he said, if Lisa wants to work in the future, she'll have to have her name on the grant, not just worked on your grant.

382
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Well, I can't remember much of the details following that, but it turned out that Christensen was about to retire.

383
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:27,000
There are circumstances here that I don't need to go into. But anyway, he was going to retire and a new one man was going to come.

384
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And I was on a national committee at the time and I was a former friend of mine at Caltech, named Dave Schumacher, was on the same committee.

385
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Dave and I mentioned to him. He was from Idaho, of course, and gone to Reed College and we'd gone to Caltech together.

386
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
He finished a little earlier than I did. I said, Dave, would you, we need a new department chairman.

387
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
He was chairman of the committee. I was on. I saw how good he was at a ministering thing.

388
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Would you, by any criteria, even consider coming back, maybe being considered as our department chairman.

389
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:17,000
There was a lot of talk about this that he decided that, yes, he might like that. He was at MIT at the time. So we invited him out.

390
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And he was off of the job and he liked Oregon. You know, it was very, very similar to a group and went to school employment.

391
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But one of the criteria for him coming was that his wife would be able to work.

392
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Here was another man on the wife team. She was a crystallographer as he was.

393
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:50,000
And McVicar was the chairman of this time. And one of the conditions for him coming was that his wife be allowed to work.

394
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And then he said, oh, by the way, he says, you know, Ken and Lisa have the same problem.

395
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And so, of McVicar came around today, he says, that's no problem. He says, I've looked this all up.

396
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:23,000
He says, two members of the same family cannot work, not only in the same department or same institution, but in the same entire system of higher education, except under unusual circumstances.

397
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And he said, this is McVicar's words. Dave relayed them to me. He said, I regard a man and wife's scientific team as an unusual circumstance.

398
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So Dave came. His wife was allowed to work with him. And at the same time, Lisa was allowed to work with me.

399
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The really remarkable and most interesting thing about this, there was one small attempt to cover the tracks here.

400
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And that was that Clara Schumacher was responsible to me. And Lisa was responsible to Dave for monitoring purposes.

401
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But of course, Dave came around and he said, well, he said, how's Lisa doing fine?

402
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I said, then he says, how's Clara doing? I said, oh, fine. So, that was that. That was the monitoring.

403
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And of course, that all disappeared in the end. But in retrospect, it's pretty funny. So that's how we were able to continue.

404
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
So Lisa did a lot of computer work.

405
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Pardon?

406
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Lisa did a lot of computer work?

407
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Well, yeah. But not just computer work. She's a special expert in programming.

408
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That has evolved during the ages that we've been here. But she is responsible for all the basic materials that we use in our research even today.

409
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Some of these programs have been modified by others and even added to by others.

410
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:25,000
But the basic thing, she is responsible for.

411
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That's very funny.

412
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Can you reflect on the early days of your computers and your work?

413
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Computers and work?

414
01:11:34,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah, well, yes. When I left Caltech, we had some IBM office machines. And we were able to operate them using IBM punched cards.

415
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:12,000
We had a very, for the time, very efficient system for doing the calculations and necessary for our work and electron diffraction.

416
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:20,000
When I came to Oregon State, we didn't have this IBM setup here at all.

417
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:35,000
But the mathematics department had managed to, the applied aspect of mathematics here was very interested in computers.

418
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And the central computer by IBM had been developed a few years earlier.

419
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And there was a computer that they managed to buy in mathematics. It was called an All-Act 3E.

420
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,000
They sold a few of these things. And we had one here. It was set up and running in mathematics and the basement.

421
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It was a tube machine. I mean, it was a huge thing with tapes and vacuum tubes.

422
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Transistors hadn't been invented yet. At least were not available and a device like this.

423
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And so we wrote together. I did programming when I first came here. There was no compiler for this machine. So we had to write things in machine language.

424
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And I learned enough to do that and wrote the very earliest programs in machine language that were run on the All-Act 3E.

425
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Well, the All-Act 3E, as our analytical scheme improved, the programs got more and more lengthy as far as that machine was concerned.

426
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And the machine by this time was beginning to teeter a bit.

427
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And there were some graduate students over there on mathematics that managed to know what tubes to interchange and exchange for the keep this thing running.

428
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:26,000
But we had to write our early programs in such a way we couldn't rely on the machine because it would make errors due to faulty hardware.

429
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And so we wrote our programs in such a way that we could run them twice and if we got the same answer, we could continue to the next stage.

430
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And Lisa and I wrote those programs. Then, by the way, I had some money and to use the machine, you had to pay.

431
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So I, at one stage, gave them a few hundred dollars from one of my grants against future computing so they could buy vacuum tubes to put into this machine.

432
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Believe it or not.

433
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Harvard Lonseth was the chairman of mathematics at that time. Very nice guy.

434
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So, a couple of years later, it turned out that statistics had gotten hold of an IBM machine.

435
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It was running on punch cards but it had a compiler and so on. And so we moved to that. That was a central computer. They charged also.

436
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But it was a much better machine than the 1410, I think it was called.

437
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And then things progressed around here. We were still doing central computing. There was a central computing center that was set up and they bought a CDC machine.

438
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And that CDC machine was better still, faster. And by this time, we had altered our programming so that we could access the machine remotely through a telephone line.

439
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And we had a teletype terminal in the laboratory. So on data from our experiments could be put out on punched paper tape.

440
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And that punched paper tape could be fed into our terminal and carried over to the computer. We thought this was boy, we were really ahead of things there. It was great.

441
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Then it turned out that was heavy demand for that machine. And the amount of storage we needed for some of our programs was huge. And they didn't have enough of it, see?

442
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So we were limited into how much storage we could use in any of our programs.

443
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:13,000
So Lisa very, very cleverly took our biggest, most demanding programs and created it to operate with overlays and so on.

444
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:22,000
That instead of saving something, she determined what would be needed and wrote the program. So succeeding stages could write right over this stuff.

445
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And so this occurred. And in that way, the program became very efficient as far as space was concerned. And then we still needed space. So I talked to them over there and they said, oh, well, you can have more space after the hours of such and such.

446
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So we would set up stuff to run on this machine at a later time.

447
01:17:44,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Then of course, that was the time that Lisa, one of the times when Lisa was hired to be working over there. Then the central computing, of course, began to gradually disappear as PCs came in.

448
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And right away, well, before that happened in chemistry, we determined that we needed a computer locally. And we managed to get a grant. Several of us pooled our knowledge and resources and made a proposal.

449
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And we were able to buy a Vax. And Lisa then converted all our programs to run on the Vax. And that was tremendous.

450
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And we have lots of programs, including plotting ones. We had a plotter also. That would work just fine.

451
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And then of course, the Vax began to be phased out. And we had a PDP 11 in our laboratory, finally, leads in me.

452
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And so some of our stuff was ran on that. But this is all very closely stuff. And the PDP 11 used large disks like this, floppy disks that were 8 inches or 10 inches in diameter.

453
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Then PCs began to appear on the scene. And so, at one stage or another, I could see that there was going to be no expertise around at all or do anything about PDP 11's.

454
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Everything was going to be going to PCs. So if we wanted to keep current and not be high and dry, that if something happened to the PD 11, nobody would know what to do.

455
01:19:47,000 --> 01:20:03,000
So we converted all of our stuff to run on PCs. And all of our data all through the years had been stored on these disks on the PDP 11.

456
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Well, we hired a guy to convert all of the stuff on the PD 11 onto disks that could in a format that can be used on smaller, well smaller, but faster PCs.

457
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And these were all on floppy disks like this. Well, pretty soon those disappeared. And we had to convert them to some other medium. And so we took all of this stuff and copied them all over on the CDs that are now like this. And I have a host of things on CDs.

458
01:20:49,000 --> 01:21:09,000
But also a whole pile of stuff on these floppies, all catalogued. And I've maintained on a couple of the PCs in my laboratory, a floppy disk drive that will still accept these old ones.

459
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:29,000
There's no reason to change it to anything else. But now we've gone to extremely fast computers. A calculation on the all WAC 3E would take us two days we can now do in about 10 seconds, something like that.

460
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:45,000
They're so fast now. And the storage is so enormous enough. I can get a program going in a hit return. I can't get my hands on my lap before all the information is on the screen again. It's been a total revolution.

461
01:21:45,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Well, in the midst of all this, some place back we had a special tectronics scope, which could feed data inward plump things for us. We can see it on the screen there. And my son later went on to a electric engineering degree and Stanford. And as a software engineer at Microsoft, now when he was in high school, he loved these computers.

462
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And he could program also. And so he played it, believe it or not, a big role in some of the very early developing, because when he was at Stanford, he would come home and say, well, what do you need now, Dad? Still interested in that.

463
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I should say one other thing. Our kids were kind of interested in science. And so Eric and Lisa and I published a paper together on work that he had actually worked on the laboratory. And this is a paper by Hadbrook, Hadbrook and Hadbrook.

464
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And it was published in the Journal of Chemical Physics. And a few years later, my daughter was interested. We published a paper, another one by Hadbrook, Hadbrook and Hadbrook. And I never managed to get the two kids to the laboratory at the same time so we could have four Hadbrooks on it.

465
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:46,000
One time I called up the Journal Editor of Chemical Physics, a man named Willard Stout, way back when I said, this is Ken Hadbrook. And he said, oh, of Hadbrook, Hadbrook and Hadbrook. Apparently he had noticed this. So anyway, that's more or less the story of computing.

466
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Okay, well, the last question for today, when we were at your office, we've seen the final folders. And can you explain what the final folders are and still we have that in record?

467
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But the final folders are. There are several stages in the analysis of a structure. And they begin with the raw data that we get from using this microdensity

468
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:28,000
data, which is the data that we get from the raw data. And these raw data are the first things that go into the folder.

469
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Now, a lot of things have to be done to that raw data because after all, you're taking what is a continuous curve and you're sampling it at very small intervals along it.

470
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And we have points that correspond to this. Now, when the plate or film moves across the dense automator, it goes across the middle and back out on the other side.

471
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So we scan the film from one side to the other. But all the time it's rotating, which means that half of the film should be identical to the other.

472
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And half of the trace should be identical to the other half. But since you're sampling by points, you can't make sure that these points are identical.

473
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:30,000
So you have to do something as we call, find the center. So we have a program that compares the two sides of this and determines where the center is.

474
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And then it takes the data on one side and that on the other, interpolates if necessary between the points, adds them all together to give you a scan.

475
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:50,000
That's all in there, finding the center. So we have the curve and counts. We have the curve curves that find the center.

476
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And then we have the data, which are just numbers. We want to convert them to something which has a common basis.

477
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And because of the properties of the dense automator, a very black film can give you the same range of numbers that a very light film can.

478
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But there's obviously a lot more scattering and one than in the other. So we have a way of converting this information to let us call it absolute densities.

479
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's not really that, but it really puts the two curves on the same scale in terms of darkness and so on.

480
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Then we have a number of programs that are designed to convert this. There is a difference between the blackness of the film and the intensity of the scattering.

481
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Now, you can get a sense of this where, for example, if you take a film and expose it for a second, you get a certain darkness.

482
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Suppose that for two seconds, you get another darkness. And of course, if in the right range, the blackness of the second would be, if you expose twice as long under identical condition, the blackness would be twice as great.

483
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Well, clearly, the longer you expose, the less the photographic film is going to respond. So pretty soon it gets black and it doesn't matter how long you expose, not going to get any blacker.

484
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So the curve that relates blackness to intensity is not linear. We have to find out how non-linear it is in terms of how dark the film is.

485
01:27:50,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So we have corrections for that. We have a whole host of corrections that are built into this that is designed to take the data from the film and put it into a form which compares with mathematically with a theoretical function that we can calculate.

486
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And there are many steps in this process. Each one of these steps builds up to this point.

487
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And then, when we've got all of that, we then have, we do a number of calculations.

488
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:56,000
The most important of which is the final fitting procedure. And it's called a least squares adjustment. And so this is a program that fits the final model to the experimental data.

489
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And the result of that is an output in the folder that shows the fitting quality of this.

490
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And then there are often plots of the curves at various stages of this procedure. So it all goes into the line printer output which those days we call the final folder.

491
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:25,000
It might be anywhere from two inches thick, well anywhere from an inch thick to three inches thick, say.

492
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And that's what you saw in those line printer folders. Now we have almost the same thing nowadays. But it is all done.

493
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Eight and a half by 11 stuff, you see.

494
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:53,000
When we're doing a hard copy that we want to look at. But now we actually put all this stuff on a disk on a CD.

495
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And it's all, we have folders on the computer for molecules that contain all the information we want. And then some folders and some folders.

496
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And I take these, the major folder and I'll just copy the whole thing over onto a CD.

497
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And I'll give it a name for the molecule and everything we want. Now we can put on this CD. Look in there. We can find it right away.

498
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:34,000
So it's a hard copy stuff that you saw in the laboratory. Really is stuff that we stopped generating maybe 20 years ago.

499
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And the later stuff is all in either in folders or on hard copy or on devices like CDs.

500
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I read recently, somebody was saying CDs are going to disappear also. So maybe it'll all be on a thumb drive now, who knows.

501
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Okay, well, we've been gone for an hour and a half. All right. Good. All right.
