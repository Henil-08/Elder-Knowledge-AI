1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay, so we are doing so, as in the past, we've learned to introduce the self-purgant

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
day's name.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:17,839
My name is Kenneth Hedberg, and this is the 20th of October 19th, 2011.

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:24,519
Okay, so today, I would like to start with you telling us about the role that you played

5
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,080
in the following papers, telling you what it is today.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,480
Yeah, well, we talked about that last time, I guess.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,480
Did we or did we not?

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:47,960
Well, I had a uncomfortable feeling I'm repeating myself here, but maybe not.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:57,640
The effort to bring the papers here began when I sat at the head table with the Helen

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Pauline during a meeting, short, in celebration of the awardee of the Pauline award, which

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,879
had been newly set up by three sections of the American Chemical Society, and she told

12
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:22,040
me at that time that people, several universities and other institutions were after Linus'

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,120
papers, but she said he didn't want them to go to these

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
institutions.

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:35,200
She said they didn't want all of his papers, and the University of Pennsylvania, I've seen

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,760
you remember, it was one of them, as well as Caltech and Stanford.

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,400
They only wanted slick proportions, but they wanted them all together, and so she said

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,600
to me that she had felt for a long time that the papers ought to come to Oregon State.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Now this was before Pauline's relations with Oregon State had been repaired, and she

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,000
went on to remark that she'd been talking to him, and she was trying to persuade him

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that he should let bygones be bygones.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that was Linus' late year?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh, gosh, that was the early 60s.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm sorry, my memory was hazy on these exact dates, but anyway, sometime now.

25
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:31,400
So I conveyed this information when I got back to the institution to President of the University

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:43,959
who at that time was Professor Johnson, and he called me and asked me if I thought that

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:53,120
Pauline would accept an invitation to come to the University and speak.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,480
And I said, well, it could well be the case, it doesn't do any harm to try.

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,719
Now have I outlined the reasons before that Pauline did not want to come to the institution?

30
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,240
I don't know, I thought we talked about that.

31
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:24,040
It's odd because, well, never mind, in the late 40s, there was a faculty member at Oregon

32
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,840
State named Ralph Spitzer, who was denied tenure in the Department of Chemistry.

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,640
He was an excellent physical chemist, and he raised the issue that he was being fired

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:47,640
for his political beliefs, found that partly on the, on a letter that he had written,

35
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,240
that was published in Chemical and Engineering News, not supporting, but at least saying

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,080
that people ought to at least think about what this fellow, the sinko, and at that time

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:09,680
the Soviet Union was saying about the effect of environment on inheritance, and of course

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,639
this flew in the face of conventional wisdom of the time that everything was inherited.

39
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:31,199
So at any rate, the faculty at the chemistry department decided that they would not offer

40
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,319
him permanent tenure, which meant, of course, that he had to leave.

41
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,199
Now I knew all the members of the chemistry department having been an undergraduate here,

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,199
a consequence of this was that Ralph Spitzer asked the American Chemical Society for a hearing

43
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:57,800
on the issue of, I forgot what the ACS committee was, but anyway, the idea is that you're not

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,800
supposed to be discharged from a teaching position on grounds of your political beliefs.

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,800
And at the 1948 meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco, which I attended,

46
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Ralph made his case, and he was strongly supported by Linus Pauling.

47
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,800
The upside of all this was that I don't think the ACS committee wanted to get its hands

48
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,800
too deeply involved in this thing and not much ever came of it, but Pauling was rather

49
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,800
actively pursuing an ocean that Spitzer was a fine scientist and there could be no reason

50
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,800
that he shouldn't be kept on for professional reasons.

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Well, AL Strand was president of Oregon State at that time and the news media or somebody

52
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,800
had made it brought up his knowledge of what Pauling had said and Strand got properly angry

53
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,800
and said, well, Oregon State can get along without Linus Pauling.

54
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,800
And Linus Pauling then said to the media, when this was reported to him, if they can get along

55
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
without Linus Pauling, they will.

56
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,800
So, from 1948 to all through the 50s, and of course, he won his Nobel Prize in 1954

57
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,800
and he spies later on, he had nothing to do with Oregon State.

58
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,800
But after Mrs. Pauling's comment to me and my relay of this information to Johnson, he

59
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,800
called me and said, as I said before, I would Pauling accept an invitation.

60
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,800
And Duke Orssis was tendered to him and he agreed, but he was going to come here

61
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,800
and he was not going to speak to the university as a whole, not going to speak

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,800
to the chemistry department on scientific subject.

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,800
So, there was a huge meeting held in the present, Gilt Orssian.

64
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:26,800
And there was a podium set up on one side of the floor and Stands were filled on the opposite side

65
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
as his kind of a stage.

66
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:38,800
And the head of time, Johnson, excuse me, asked me if I would introduce Pauling.

67
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, as you think about that, here is a distinguished scientist coming to speak to the university

68
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,800
and the present university is not introducing him.

69
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
An ordinary faculty member like me was asked to do so.

70
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:05,800
But in my presence, Pauling and I, and Johnson and maybe some other people were there,

71
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Johnson and Barney, that I was going to introduce him and he turned to me and said,

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
you're going to introduce me, Ken, and I said, yes, he's asked me to do that.

73
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Pauling didn't say a word, but it was perfectly clear that he felt that it was appropriate

74
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,800
for the university president to do the introduction.

75
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:32,799
Well, so anyway, all of Mrs. Johnson and President Johnson and either Helen Pauling and Linus and Lisa

76
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,799
and I got in the limo and we were chauffeur over to the hall of Sam.

77
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,799
And everybody was sitting there waiting.

78
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,799
We filed in and went up on the stage and a few things were said.

79
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,799
And then I was supposed to give my introduction, which I did in a few minutes.

80
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:55,799
And about this time, Mrs. Pauling was about to speak and filed a group of students.

81
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:03,799
They were all black and many prominent among them were many members of the football team.

82
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:10,799
And this was at the time when the great punk and the decree that football players were not going to be able to wear beers.

83
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,800
And at that point, all hell broke loose and there were meetings on the campus regarding free speech

84
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,800
and the ability of the students to football team to have a personal appearance as they wished.

85
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
And the great punk and insisted that he finally resulted.

86
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I think to saying that the beers didn't fit very well with the helmets and so on.

87
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:48,800
At any rate, in due course, these people, they said a few words and then they turned and abruptly filed out.

88
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:58,800
And very well behaved and so Pauling gave his speech, which was on peace and very well received and so on.

89
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,800
And then at the dinner of that evening, Helen Pauling said to me, she said,

90
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:18,800
oh, I was so surprised. She said, I thought all these flocks that had filed in were there were going to sing.

91
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Well, that was the beginning of several overtures of Pauling.

92
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,800
He came back succeeding occasions but in the middle of all this.

93
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Well, none in the middle, but I think at the beginning of all this, I had reported to Jensen that Pauling,

94
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,800
that Mrs. Pauling thought that Melinas' papers should come to Oregon State.

95
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
And of course, that would have been a great coup.

96
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,800
And so he gingerly broached the subject to Pauling.

97
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I wrote him a letter about this, actually.

98
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:10,800
And Pauling in due course responded and saying that he would give it some thought that he was not yet prepared to give up his papers because he was still actively using the materials that were in.

99
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:20,800
And after Jensen retired, he was succeeded by the victor.

100
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:29,800
And I didn't think a great deal about this. Pauling was now coming and doing occasions.

101
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,800
And it suddenly occurred to me that I should forward the information that I had given to Jensen to him as well.

102
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,800
So I dug out the correspondence letter that I had written.

103
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,800
And President Jensen's response to it and typed another letter and sent it off to Dr. McPickery.

104
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Jensen Ariel was repeated, and he again, queried Pauling on his papers.

105
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,800
This was now some several years later after the first overture, but he got the same response back.

106
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Pauling wasn't yet ready to park through these papers.

107
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,800
And time went on, and John Byrne became president.

108
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,800
And once again, I hold out these papers. Now I've had two sets of correspondence and wrote to John, sent it off to him.

109
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:33,800
And his response was a little bit different. He immediately set up a committee on which I served.

110
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,800
And he made a concrete offer to Linus Pauling at the others' hand.

111
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,800
He said, we are very unparaphrasing him. Now you could talk to John and find out exactly how this went.

112
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:55,800
But the gist of it was that he said that they would create a, or they would not just set up a room or something.

113
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,800
They would create a special collections in which you could, you know, all of these papers could be housed.

114
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,800
They would build this for him, for him.

115
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I think you see, I only see these facts from what I remember of our contacts.

116
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,800
But I should be checked with John.

117
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,800
The member of the committee was Rob Phillips, and some others who I can't remember now.

118
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,800
But anyway, this went on. And this time Pauling agreed. This is what would transpire.

119
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,800
But he wanted also the home papers to come as well.

120
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:48,800
He strongly felt all his life that after he had won the Peace Prize that she should have shared in it, because she was the one that actually stimulated his activity in that area.

121
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Well, there was a huge, and he agreed to do this.

122
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,800
The first thing that he did was supply to the University, and you'll know all this in the records of the special collections.

123
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:16,800
You sent copies of the signatories to the proposal for the way of holding the petition for banning,

124
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,800
exploding explosion of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, atmospheric test bands.

125
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,800
And that was the first thing I'd believed that came to Oregon State.

126
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,800
And only gradually did the other materials appear still because, of course,

127
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,800
when I was Pauling was acting until shortly before it was just a short time before it was done.

128
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:53,800
And I remember, excuse me, people here were not clear about how big this collection of Pauling was.

129
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:04,800
And so the Duke course, the University suggested that Pauling suggested that they come down and take a look at what he had.

130
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:13,800
And Krishnamurthy was sent down.

131
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,800
And he came back and told me I'd kind of crosses where his eyes should be.

132
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,800
He says there were over 90 filing cases down at Big Sur, where Pauling had his ranch.

133
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
You see, all the stuff had been moved down there.

134
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,800
And he said, Krishnamurthy was, of Lamesh, was just totally blown away by all of this.

135
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Well, in Duke course, oh, after Pauling had agreed to give his papers,

136
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:55,800
there was a very, very elegant reception in Portland with several speakers and lavish dinner.

137
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I was really a very, very nice affair and Pauling spoke.

138
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:13,800
And at that stage, somehow the question came up about all of his materials coming here.

139
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:20,800
And there had been some feelings.

140
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Some of the family members, particularly Linda, I think, who felt that the family should have held control over some of these.

141
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Pauling was asked, well, what does your family think about all of this?

142
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
And he says, well, Linda's here, why don't you ask her?

143
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I don't remember what a response was, but I do remember Pauling's statement very clearly.

144
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Well, as time went on, these things began to arrive.

145
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,800
So to arrive, these filing cases, now remember, well, I'm just describing to me a truck and pull up

146
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
and discourage a few of these filing cases and so on.

147
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,800
And that was a start, and that saw the project through to completion.

148
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I don't know when the last of these materials actually arrived here at special collections,

149
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
but that's kind of the history of how they came here.

150
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:28,799
At least of the role that I played in it, doing nothing but reminding one president after another of what Pauling had,

151
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,799
what Mrs. Pauling had urged him to do in the fact that the relations had been repaired,

152
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:42,799
seemed between the university and Linus Pauling, seemed to suggest that things might go smoothly forward from there.

153
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,799
I do know that he was actually very fond of the university,

154
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,799
but he came on visits which he did not in frequently.

155
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:01,799
I usually was somehow involved in escorting him around,

156
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,799
walking the campus with him in a number of occasions.

157
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,799
We walked around the campus for one time.

158
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,799
We walked up in the old, who was in those days known as a chem-shack,

159
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,799
and didn't quite seriously remodel from Pauling's time,

160
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,799
but he seemed to be able to pick out the room in which he had been lecturing

161
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,799
when they either held on Pauling and appeared in his life.

162
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:35,799
And we walked down 15th Street and he showed me a house there that he had lived in as a student.

163
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,799
And I said to him, it's rather surprising,

164
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,799
because there's a certain parallelism in our experience here,

165
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,799
because I lived on 15th Street also, on the other side of the street,

166
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,799
just to have a block down, and I was an undergraduate student.

167
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,799
So I took a picture of him in Linda on the steps of the house.

168
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,799
I have it somewhere in my materials at home.

169
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:11,799
So the other thing I would say is that,

170
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:22,799
when Pauling began to come back to Oregon State on occasions,

171
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,799
we saw him and his wife as long as she was living quite frequently at home,

172
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,799
for dinner and places and things like that.

173
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,799
So we got to know them pretty well, better than when I was a student.

174
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,799
Of course, when I was a Kel Tech as a student, I was a student.

175
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:48,799
So it's been, for me, a wonderful, exhilarating experience.

176
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,799
So does that answer your query?

177
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,799
I've spent 20 minutes describing it.

178
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,799
Well, I'm interested in getting the memories of the times

179
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,799
that even on the minus can come up frequently in your house.

180
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,799
Oh, yeah, sure.

181
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,799
I have, I keep thinking that I have said some of this to you before,

182
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,799
but it may have been to somebody else.

183
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:34,799
But let me think just a moment.

184
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
One time, this was in the music anecdote,

185
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,799
and I don't know whether it involved well,

186
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,799
but I don't remember the whole clause for a dinner party

187
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,799
that the Paulings and we were invited to along with Dave Shoemaker,

188
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,799
who was chairman of our department,

189
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,799
who, by the way, knew Pauling very well.

190
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,799
He was a student at Kel Tech when I was.

191
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,799
And we all knew that Pauling,

192
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,799
he didn't shy away from alcohol.

193
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
He liked the vodka.

194
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,799
And on the evening of the dinner party,

195
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,799
just before about four o'clock,

196
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,799
I got a call from the host.

197
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,799
Sorry about my throat.

198
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,799
Asking me, I know that Dr. Pauling likes vodka,

199
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,799
says, I looked at my cupboard and I don't have any,

200
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
and I don't have any way of getting it.

201
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,799
Do you happen to have any vodka?

202
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,799
And I said, well, as a matter of fact, I do.

203
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,799
Am I told this story?

204
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,799
No.

205
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,799
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

206
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,799
When I went into my cupboard,

207
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,799
I had maybe two thirds of a bottle there.

208
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,799
And so I got a brown paper bag,

209
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,799
and put the bottle in it.

210
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,799
And then we were picked up,

211
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,799
and the Paulings were picked up.

212
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,799
And we were driven up to the whole house,

213
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,799
running a doorbell, and he appeared.

214
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,799
And everybody shook hands,

215
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,799
and it is why I greeted everyone,

216
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,799
most pleasantly, and as I walked in,

217
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,799
I handed him my paper bag with a bottle in it.

218
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
And then every minute settled down for a bit,

219
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,799
and the living room before dinner was served.

220
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,799
The host said, well, would anybody like a drink?

221
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
And Dr. Pauling said, well,

222
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,799
you don't happen to have any vodka to you.

223
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:41,799
And the host said, well, as a matter of fact, I do.

224
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,799
So I thought that story, I think,

225
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,799
is very funny on retrospect,

226
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,799
but at any rate,

227
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,799
I never told Pauling this history at all.

228
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,799
So,

229
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,799
after either Helen died,

230
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,799
he continued to come to Oregon State,

231
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,799
often with Linda,

232
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,799
who accompanied him.

233
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,799
And they would come.

234
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,799
There were lots of things set up at the University of Receptions here.

235
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,799
There was a big library reception one time,

236
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,799
and there were seminars and chemistry,

237
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,799
and even in physics.

238
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,799
And then, usually, after these affairs,

239
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,799
and before dinner,

240
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,799
well, I say usually that,

241
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,799
often at any rate,

242
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,799
he and Linda would come to the house.

243
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,799
And on one occasion,

244
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,799
I'm referring still now

245
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,799
to his enjoyment of a drink before dinner.

246
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
We were on the campus walking around.

247
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,799
I said, what would you like to do now before the next reception,

248
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,799
which was an hour and a half?

249
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,799
I said, well, can we go to your house for a drink?

250
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,799
Yes, we could.

251
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,799
So, he went over to my house,

252
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,799
and he said, you don't have any vodka.

253
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,799
And he said, yeah, I thought, I know you like that.

254
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
And so, I got a glass,

255
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,799
a small tumbler,

256
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,799
like it puts a nice in it.

257
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,799
And he drank straight vodka.

258
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,799
It's essentially pure alcohol.

259
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,799
He told me at one other occasion.

260
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,799
Before dinner, he always had one of these cocktails,

261
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,799
but that was about it.

262
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,799
I started to pour, and I said, say, when?

263
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,799
He didn't say when.

264
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,799
When the thing was full, I stopped,

265
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,799
and he looked out and he looked at me with a smile.

266
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
There was a lot of ice in it,

267
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,799
so it really wasn't an awful lot of vodka, I think.

268
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,799
Anyway, we chatted a while,

269
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,799
and then he said to me, can I have another?

270
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,799
And Linda was sitting there,

271
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,799
and they had to go, this is the time we had to go to reception

272
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,799
over here in the library,

273
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,799
some place or another.

274
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,799
It was a library reception,

275
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,799
but it was held in the M.U.

276
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,799
and one of the rooms at the M.U.

277
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,799
And anyway, he says, can I have another vodka?

278
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,799
I put some more ice in it and pour it again.

279
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,799
And once again, I stopped when it was full,

280
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,799
and Linda was over there,

281
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,799
and said, daddy, daddy, you shouldn't do that.

282
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,799
You've got to go to a reception today.

283
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,799
Well, he just smiled at her,

284
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
and then we got up and walked out,

285
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,799
and he walked straight as a rod.

286
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,799
He didn't waiver at all.

287
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,799
We got in a car, went over there,

288
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,799
and he walked in,

289
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,799
and he shook hands with people.

290
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,799
You couldn't tell.

291
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,799
And, you know, he didn't weigh an awful lot.

292
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,799
He probably weighed 165 pounds, or 60 pounds,

293
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,799
or something.

294
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
A tall man and loose-jointed,

295
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
if everybody knows it.

296
00:25:52,799 --> 00:26:00,799
And the reception went off just fine.

297
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
At one dinner party,

298
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,799
when this appalling was still alive,

299
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,799
we had tried to set it up in a nice fashion.

300
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,799
We had another pair of the Paulings,

301
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,799
and Lisa and me, and another couple of them,

302
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,799
and I'd been two more, maybe eight people.

303
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,799
But we had a first course with some white wine,

304
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,799
and I brought out the bottle,

305
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,799
and poured the white wine,

306
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,799
and the wine was picked up the bottle,

307
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,799
and it says, aw, he says, yeah,

308
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,799
this is my camp pronounces,

309
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,799
well, to eat, we say.

310
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,799
And he says, that's the same wine you served us last year.

311
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:48,799
Which, why he would remember,

312
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,799
of all of the dinner parties,

313
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,799
it'd been to what wine we had saved him

314
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,799
at the dinner party a year before,

315
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,799
it beats me.

316
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
But anyway, that was his remark.

317
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,799
It's been great fun knowing,

318
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,799
and so does that answer your question

319
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,799
about the papers and so on?

320
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,799
I want to ask you about the shoemakers.

321
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,799
We have their questions.

322
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,799
Yes.

323
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,799
That's a question.

324
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,799
You've ever seen in a vlog,

325
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,799
what do you call it on what they're like?

326
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,799
Is there people in there saying that?

327
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,799
Oh, well.

328
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,799
Dave's shoemaker and I were close friends,

329
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,799
and when they,

330
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,799
we served on a national committee together,

331
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,799
the United States,

332
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,799
the American Crystalographic Association,

333
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,799
has a committee on which, well,

334
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,799
at any rate, we had a meeting

335
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,799
to which I traveled in Washington, D.C.,

336
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,799
and Dave's shoemaker was the chairman of this committee.

337
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,799
Well, he and I had been students at Caltech,

338
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,799
and I knew him very well.

339
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,799
And at the end,

340
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,799
before I left,

341
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,799
we were looking for a replacement

342
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,799
for Bert Christensen, who was retiring.

343
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,799
And there was some talk,

344
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,799
given about bringing in, in fact,

345
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,799
it was preferred to bring in an outside person.

346
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,799
And I was impressed with how Dave,

347
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,799
who was then at MIT,

348
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,799
as professor of chemistry,

349
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,799
and a crystallographer,

350
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:24,799
ran this meeting,

351
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,799
he was very efficient.

352
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
I thought, gee, he'd be a good chairman.

353
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,799
And so, the meeting was,

354
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,799
one under a very, very tight schedule we had.

355
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,799
We worked furiously for several hours,

356
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,799
and then people had to disband,

357
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,799
and they were not having a dinner.

358
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,799
They were going to go home.

359
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,799
So I had almost, I said, Dave, I want to talk to you.

360
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,799
And he said, well, he says, you know,

361
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:48,799
I've got to catch a train.

362
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,799
I saw some such a time,

363
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,799
but he says, I'm on the way to the restroom.

364
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,799
Let's go to the restroom.

365
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,799
Well, this may sound indelicate,

366
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,799
and when you play it back again,

367
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,799
but there we were on a pair of urinals,

368
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,799
which were at an angle to each other.

369
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,799
So we were somewhere facing each other,

370
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,799
and I outlined this situation to him,

371
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,799
and asked him if he would consider,

372
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,799
think about being considered as department chairman.

373
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,799
Of course, Dave grew up in Idaho,

374
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,799
went to recall it, so he loved the West.

375
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,799
And although MIT was a very prestigious institution,

376
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,799
and they had a summer house,

377
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,799
he and Clara up in the mountains.

378
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,799
He said, yes, he would think about it.

379
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,799
So he came out,

380
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,799
and people liked him,

381
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,799
and he was off of the job.

382
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,799
Well, one of the conditions for the job

383
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:49,799
from his point of view was that his wife, Clara Brink,

384
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,799
was also a distinguished crystallographer,

385
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,799
and she wanted to be able to work

386
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
and to have an appointment.

387
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,799
At that time, there was a law.

388
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,799
In fact, it may still exist,

389
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,799
that came into being during the Depression.

390
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,799
It was an anti-nepotism law,

391
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,799
and it decreed that no members of the same family,

392
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,799
I don't remember how that was defined,

393
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,799
could work in the same department

394
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,799
or in fact in the same institution,

395
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,799
but even further in the state system of higher education,

396
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:29,799
except under unusual circumstances.

397
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,799
Well, about this time,

398
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,799
my wife was also a scientist.

399
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,799
We've been working together for years,

400
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,799
and we had a joint grant together,

401
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,799
and previous to that,

402
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,799
she had had appointments in the computer center

403
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,799
as an associate professor,

404
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,799
and so on.

405
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,799
So she was a professional,

406
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,799
but then it was determined,

407
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,799
that by a Bert Christensen,

408
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,799
that he wasn't going to allow her to work any longer

409
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,799
and be paid.

410
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,799
And so I went to him and said,

411
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
look, we've got this grant here,

412
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,799
and then you've signed it on the bottom,

413
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,799
the line item on the budget,

414
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,799
and Lisa has to be able to work.

415
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,799
She says, I'm not going to approve it.

416
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,799
So we took it over to Vern Shell,

417
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,799
a woman who was being a science at that time,

418
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,799
and brought it in, I showed him this,

419
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,799
and he says, well,

420
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,799
what didn't she tell me this sooner?

421
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,799
And I said, well, Bert Christensen,

422
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,799
and he were very close friends,

423
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,799
and I thought we should be talking to the chain of command here,

424
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,799
and he says, well,

425
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,799
here is a document that's legal.

426
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,799
He says she's going to be able to work on this grant

427
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,799
until it expires,

428
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,799
but after that,

429
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,799
if she wants to continue to be paid,

430
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,799
she'll have to be,

431
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,799
get a grant of her own.

432
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,799
Well, all this, a privilege,

433
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,799
a day of coming,

434
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,799
and one of his conditions,

435
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,799
as I say,

436
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,799
was his wife be allowed to work.

437
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,799
And Lisa's heart,

438
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,799
Mick Victor, came around,

439
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,799
and he looked at this,

440
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,799
and he says, okay.

441
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,799
He says, it says that you cannot have members

442
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,799
of the same family working in this institution

443
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,799
at the same time,

444
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,799
and being paid except under unusual circumstances.

445
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,799
He says, it's clear that a husband and wife's scientific

446
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,799
team is an unusual circumstance.

447
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,799
So he says, I am going to approve this.

448
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,799
And then Dave said, yeah,

449
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,799
but Ken Hedberg and his wife are exactly the same situation,

450
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,799
and Mick Victor says the same rule of applied on them.

451
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,799
Then Mick Victor said,

452
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,799
and this is very funny,

453
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,799
or Dave and I are close friends,

454
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,799
and our wives are friends.

455
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,799
And Mick Victor says,

456
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,799
the only thing I'm going to ask is that

457
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,799
you be responsible for Lisa, my wife,

458
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,799
and Ken would be responsible for Clara.

459
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,799
So once a term,

460
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,799
Dave would call me in these offices,

461
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,799
okay, Ken, how is Clara doing?

462
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,799
And we would have a big laugh,

463
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,799
but when I said, fine,

464
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,799
I said, how's Lucy doing fine?

465
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,799
He says, that's it.

466
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,799
So that's the history of,

467
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,799
with that condition,

468
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,799
Dave accepted the job,

469
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,799
and was here,

470
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:20,799
certain at capacity for several years,

471
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,799
until he retired,

472
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,799
and then he and Clara had an office in chemistry.

473
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,799
But he became ill with kidney disease.

474
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,799
Funny was on dialysis,

475
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,799
and died of a heart attack on time

476
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,799
during dialysis over an Albany.

477
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,799
Clara lived for several years after that,

478
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,799
and they set up a fund,

479
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,799
anchored with $100,000 to begin with

480
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,799
for the support of students in chemistry.

481
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,799
So that's Dave Shoemaker.

482
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,799
Dave and I shared an office at Caltech.

483
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,799
It's another interesting thing about him.

484
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,799
I have never been a smoker,

485
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,799
but he was.

486
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,800
And I told this story at meetings

487
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
when people will ask me about Dave.

488
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
I said, well, you know,

489
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
he didn't have an astray

490
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
because that wouldn't have lasted long.

491
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
He had a,

492
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,800
a French 75,

493
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
how it's so showcasing,

494
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
which is a brass thing,

495
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
with a rim on the bottom,

496
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
and still about two and a half feet high,

497
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
and I had a notch cut on the top

498
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
and he'd stick his cigarette in that,

499
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
flip it and the ashes would come down.

500
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
When he left,

501
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
that thing was folded a rim with ashes

502
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
in my office.

503
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I threw it out, of course.

504
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,800
But he gave up smoking right after that

505
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
when he went to MIT.

506
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
And Clara never smoked,

507
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,800
and she had some respiratory problems

508
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
asthma and so on in her late years.

509
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
So that might have been part of the cause.

510
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
They have a distinguished son,

511
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
a Bobby Schumacher,

512
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,800
who went off to Britain,

513
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,800
and he's an historian.

514
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,800
And he's at one of the

515
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Southwestern British universities,

516
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
and he, believe it or not,

517
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
has a position

518
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,800
as a professor of English history.

519
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
This is an American.

520
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
He's still an American citizen.

521
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
And he's written,

522
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
his thesis was a penetrating book,

523
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
a penetrating document,

524
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
which was published in book form,

525
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
and got very, very good reviews.

526
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,800
So I think that's an interesting sideline

527
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
to the Schumacher's.

528
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Both scientists,

529
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
the son of historian,

530
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,800
lecturing on any English history to Brits,

531
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,800
and being academically rewarded for it.

532
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
We talked a little bit about your early trips

533
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
to Norway and your associations

534
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
with Norwegians,

535
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
and I wanted to talk a little bit more

536
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
about how that has continued

537
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,800
every time you mentioned Norway and Norwegians.

538
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Oh, well.

539
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Let's see.

540
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I want to make sure that,

541
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm talking about the things you would want me to.

542
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
How I went to Norway,

543
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
and how my relationship

544
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
with Norway and Norwegians

545
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
continued professionally through the years, is that?

546
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
We talked about the initial trip.

547
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
How about what?

548
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
We talked about your initial trip to Norway

549
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
and meeting you once, of course,

550
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
and then your early associations

551
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
with other baskets,

552
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
and then you know how to hassle

553
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
and you think that's true.

554
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Yes, well.

555
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,800
And my professional associations

556
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,800
with Norway developed

557
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
as a consequence of knowing

558
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Professor Oltowolstjonsen.

559
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
The later became richer of the university.

560
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't remember whether I've mentioned that or not.

561
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,800
But when I was there,

562
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I spent,

563
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
oh, I've lived in Norway probably

564
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
about five years or so old,

565
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
mostly on one year's stance.

566
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
And by the way,

567
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Pauling has often come when I've been there,

568
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
and we've escorted him around

569
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Bosjonsen and I,

570
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,800
the various places in Norway

571
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
and gone to meetings and talks

572
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
that he's held,

573
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
that he held.

574
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
At any rate,

575
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
at least his family connections

576
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
still, you know,

577
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
early years of our marriage

578
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
were pretty strong

579
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
and she liked to go back to Norway.

580
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,800
So, on my first sabbatical leave,

581
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,800
at Oregon State,

582
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I decided I would go back to Norway.

583
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,800
We had some big projects going on

584
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,800
that we could share Norway

585
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
with our Norwegian colleagues.

586
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,800
So, I spent a year at the University of Oslo,

587
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
then again, in sabbatical,

588
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
and Lisa worked also as she came in.

589
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
And we had a nice house

590
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,800
arranged for us by the university.

591
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Actually, it's an,

592
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
you know, an apartment.

593
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
They don't have houses there

594
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,800
by and large for younger people.

595
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
So,

596
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
during this time,

597
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
I met a number of people

598
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
that were essentially two laboratories

599
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
doing my kind of work.

600
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
One at the University of Oslo

601
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,800
and the other at the University of Trondheim,

602
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,800
which didn't have that name at the time.

603
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,800
And one of the,

604
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Lisa got her training

605
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,800
in Boston's laboratory

606
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
in a number of other people

607
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
did.

608
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Also, one of whom was a lady named

609
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Maudet,

610
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
who went to Trondheim,

611
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
became professor there.

612
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
And I was invited up there

613
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
and gave a lecture,

614
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
and she introduced me to a student of hers

615
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
named Koldjörn Hagen.

616
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
And Koldjörn Hagen,

617
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
the question was,

618
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
he was just finishing his degree

619
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
and I was looking for a postdoctoral associate.

620
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
So, I said to Maudet,

621
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I said,

622
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
well, is he pretty good?

623
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
And she said, yes, he's very good.

624
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
So, Koldjörn came to the United States.

625
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
That was the beginning

626
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,800
of a professional relationship.

627
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I think that,

628
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,800
probably my strongest professional relationship,

629
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
apart from that,

630
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
of course,

631
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
is my wife and the work

632
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
that she does in the laboratory

633
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
of anyone.

634
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
And he has spent a total of six years

635
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
in Koldjörn Hagen,

636
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
coming at various times

637
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
for years,

638
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
and once, twice,

639
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
two-year leave,

640
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
and so on.

641
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
And...

642
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Sorry, man.

643
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
How did he spell his name?

644
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Just to make sure he...

645
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Hagen,

646
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
H-H-A-G-E-M,

647
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
and the first name is Koldjörn.

648
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Koldjörn is,

649
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
it's K-O-L,

650
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
and then B-J,

651
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Umblaut-O-R-M.

652
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,800
That means bear in the origin.

653
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
So, anyway,

654
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
this relationship

655
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
went on through the years,

656
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
and then one time,

657
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I received an invitation,

658
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
oh, I was asked several times

659
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,800
to serve on doctoral committees.

660
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
And one of them was

661
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Maudet's committee,

662
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
when she obtained her doctorate,

663
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
that was quite early in my career,

664
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
and that was lots of fun,

665
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
because it was all done very formally, you know,

666
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
there's a first opponent,

667
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
a second opponent,

668
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
and then a third one

669
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
was kind of a humorous opponent.

670
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
So, I was the first opponent.

671
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
And in these formal things,

672
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
you're dressed very formally

673
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
on the old days,

674
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
you used to wear tuxedos.

675
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
The candidate was a man,

676
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
a tuxedo.

677
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
But we had a podium,

678
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
and the candidate was over here,

679
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Maudet,

680
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
and I was here,

681
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
and there was an auditorium for people,

682
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
and I had been given her thesis,

683
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
and I would ask her questions,

684
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
and she would answer,

685
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
and so on.

686
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
And at the end,

687
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
by the way,

688
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I was paid a substantial amount of money for this,

689
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
and that was a norm for the time.

690
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
So, we had a tremendous,

691
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
the tradition is that

692
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
a successful candidate throws a party,

693
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
and we had a wonderful,

694
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
absolutely wonderful dinner party

695
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
at her house,

696
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
that's not formed in association,

697
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,800
that continued until her death years later,

698
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
but she's spent time in Cornalos also.

699
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
At any rate,

700
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
so after in my mid-career,

701
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,800
when Collegor and Gropian informed me

702
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,800
that the university had elected

703
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
to give me an honorary degree,

704
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
so I could come up there,

705
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,800
and that was a tremendous fun also.

706
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
There were three of us

707
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,800
who were awarded an honorary degree,

708
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
and one of the guys was a fellow

709
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
from Germany,

710
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
who had just won the Nobel Prize,

711
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,800
so I felt myself in distinguished companies.

712
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
And there was a big party,

713
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I still think of that great funness.

714
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,800
And then, I think sometime before this,

715
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
I was elected to membership

716
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,800
in the Origin Academy of Sciences,

717
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
and a bit later,

718
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
on another occasion,

719
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
a few years later,

720
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,800
these are the American Equivalents.

721
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,800
The actual Norwegian name is,

722
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
well, I don't have to describe it,

723
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
but anyway,

724
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,800
let's say one of them is an origin counter-part

725
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,800
of the National Academy of Sciences here,

726
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
and the other one is an origin counter-part

727
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,800
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,

728
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
and I've been asked,

729
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I've been awarded a membership in each one of these.

730
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
So all of this is a consequence

731
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
of this long stretch of professional affiliation

732
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,800
I've had with people in Norway.

733
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I think the laboratory

734
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,800
that does my kind of work in Oslo is now extinct,

735
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,800
and the one in the Trondheim is also,

736
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,800
everybody who is involved in my day,

737
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
just as I am, is retired.

738
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
And so, the University

739
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,800
efforts have gone off in different directions,

740
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,800
but everyone that belongs to this laboratory,

741
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
almost every single person in Oslo,

742
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I think barring one,

743
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,800
has been sometime in my laboratory,

744
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,800
and almost everyone in Trondheim

745
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
spent time in my laboratory.

746
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
So there's a,

747
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
and that number is,

748
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
oh, maybe

749
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,800
10 or 15 people all together

750
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,800
who spent as long as two years

751
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
in my laboratory.

752
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I have a book in my office,

753
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
in which I formed the early habit

754
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,800
of taking a photo and picture

755
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
and pasting the book

756
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
and asking them to sign the name to it,

757
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
and all of these people are there.

758
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
And on one occasion,

759
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,800
when I was going to go to Norway,

760
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,800
I was asked if I would give a talk in Trondheim.

761
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
And I said, yes,

762
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
and I got to thinking about this.

763
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
So, cold and hot,

764
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
and by this time,

765
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
I'd become a professor in Trondheim.

766
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
So I fished out all the pictures

767
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
that I had

768
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
and arranged them in sequence

769
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
from the time he first came,

770
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
the time he last came,

771
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
and there were about eight of them.

772
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,800
And I had a series of slides

773
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
made of these.

774
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
When I came to talk,

775
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
I said, I want to show you the history of one

776
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
of our good friends.

777
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
And so,

778
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
I put these up there

779
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
and to the immense hilarity

780
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,800
of the audience

781
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
because they'd never seen Hogan

782
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
as a young man.

783
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,800
They'd only seen it

784
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
and I could show his development

785
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
with dates underneath it.

786
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Well, that made quite a hit

787
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
in that talk.

788
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
He's never let me forget about that,

789
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
even.

790
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
So, it's been a great

791
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,800
boon and fun for me.

792
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,800
So, I have also formed

793
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,800
professional attachments

794
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
and friends with people

795
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
at the University of Trondheim,

796
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
which is in the Northern Norway,

797
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
and at the University of Oregon,

798
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,800
in the West Coast.

799
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
So, it's been a very fine thing

800
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
for me.

801
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
I have a list of names

802
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
of people from the

803
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
OSU Chemistry Department

804
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
over the years.

805
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
I'm going to share any

806
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
recollections that you have

807
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
about some of these folks.

808
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
John Fulton.

809
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
John Fulton was the only

810
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
one that I never met

811
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,800
in person.

812
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
When I came to Oregon State

813
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,800
in 1939, Gilbert

814
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
was chair.

815
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
And I don't know how long

816
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
he had been chairman at that point.

817
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,800
But he certainly was still

818
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,800
chairman in 1956,

819
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
when I returned.

820
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
And I think he actually

821
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,800
retired from the

822
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
chairmanship in 1957,

823
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
wanting to spend the last

824
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
two years of his life

825
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
doing teaching and research

826
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,800
again.

827
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
That's when Christensen succeeded

828
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,800
in.

829
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,800
So, every, I don't know

830
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
the Christmas, whether you've

831
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
seen all the pictures

832
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
in chemistry, have you?

833
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
If you go into the main

834
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
hall, Gilbert Hall,

835
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
on the end, nearest

836
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,800
here, the library,

837
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
and walk down on the left-hand

838
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,800
side, high up is a chronological

839
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
arrangement of all professors

840
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,800
that have been present at this

841
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,800
in that department and retired.

842
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
John Fulton was the first

843
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
one in the list.

844
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Every single person I have known

845
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
of a succeeding 20 or 30

846
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,800
that belonged down the hall.

847
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Of course, the last,

848
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
I've been retired long enough,

849
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
so I'm quite a long ways

850
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
from the end now.

851
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
But everybody on to the

852
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
present I've known them all,

853
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,800
except Fulton.

854
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
That's what kind of we

855
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,800
got that.

856
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,800
How about thanks for

857
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
going through it?

858
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Sorry.

859
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Thanks for going through it.

860
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Go through it?

861
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
Go through it.

862
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Oh yes.

863
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,800
Yeah.

864
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,800
He didn't have an active

865
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
role in the chemistry department.

866
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
He was Dean of the College of

867
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Science, and during the war,

868
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,800
for a short time, he was

869
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
acting president of the

870
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
University, if I remember this

871
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
correctly.

872
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,800
But he was a very

873
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,800
erudite man,

874
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
and a wonderful personality.

875
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
I didn't know him well.

876
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
I met him on a number of

877
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
occasions, and he was still

878
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
alive when I returned to

879
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,800
the University.

880
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,800
But he suffered from,

881
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
I don't remember whether it was

882
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Parkinson's or all.

883
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
I think it was all

884
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,800
some of the species that he

885
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
finally succumbed to.

886
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,800
But he was just a wonderful

887
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
guy.

888
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,800
His family has set up a

889
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
researcher ward in his name,

890
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
called a girlfriend,

891
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,800
and that's given every

892
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,800
year to a faculty member.

893
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Errol Gilbert.

894
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,800
Errol Gilbert.

895
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,800
The hall was not named

896
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Gilbert Hall until after he

897
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,800
died, because there was at

898
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,800
that time a rule against

899
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,800
naming buildings after

900
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
living people.

901
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Gilbert was a big guy.

902
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,800
He walked with a kind of

903
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
shuffle.

904
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,800
He was a physical chemist.

905
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,800
He had two sons, Henry

906
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,800
and Allen.

907
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,800
Henry was a classmate of

908
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
mine as an undergraduate,

909
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,800
and in the war broke out he

910
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
was involved in war work or

911
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,800
over in Albany at the,

912
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,800
I don't know, there was a

913
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,800
bureau of mines in there,

914
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
whether he was working with

915
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
watching or whatever on

916
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
war work.

917
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,800
But he died of a,

918
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,800
of a malignancy.

919
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,800
People think it was related

920
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
to ingestion or inhalation

921
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
of burilia, which was

922
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
extremely toxic.

923
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
His son, Allen Gilbert,

924
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
I mean his brother,

925
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Allen Gilbert, Errol Gilbert

926
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
was a surgeon at the

927
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
Kolaula's clinic for many

928
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
years.

929
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,800
He retired as I understand

930
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,800
it because he developed

931
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,800
severe arthritis in his hands.

932
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,800
He was a very nice guy.

933
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Well, Gilbert, I had only one

934
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
course from him when I was an

935
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
undergraduate.

936
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
The department chairman

937
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,800
actually taught them.

938
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
And he taught physical

939
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,800
chemistry.

940
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,800
I recall one kind of

941
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,800
plungent experience with

942
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,800
Errol Gilbert when I was an

943
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
undergraduate.

944
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
There was a chemistry

945
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
honor society called

946
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,800
Philanboopsalon.

947
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,800
And I was elected

948
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,800
membership in this.

949
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,800
And Henry Gilbert, who was a

950
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,800
chemistry major, was not.

951
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,800
Now, Henry Gilbert was a,

952
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,800
I want to say, a very

953
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,800
outspoken, outgoing guy.

954
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,800
And he was not elected

955
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,800
to, when you're elected to

956
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
membership of voters taken.

957
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
And if there is any, I don't

958
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,800
recall what the circumstances of

959
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,800
the election, what the rules

960
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,800
are, or were at that time.

961
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
But he was not elected.

962
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
And Errol Gilbert, his father

963
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,800
was very upset at this.

964
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,800
And he called me into his

965
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
office.

966
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,800
And he says, I cannot ask you

967
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,800
who he, in a very

968
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
different way, let me know he was

969
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
very disappointed that Henry had

970
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
not been elected.

971
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,800
At that time, the chemistry,

972
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
the Philanboopsalon had members

973
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,800
comprising majors in chemistry

974
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,800
and chemical engineers largely.

975
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
And he says, I can't ask you,

976
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,800
of course, about the vote.

977
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,800
But he said, can you tell me this?

978
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
I suspect, was it mostly the

979
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
engineers that were involved in

980
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,800
this negative vote.

981
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,800
And I hesitated a long time

982
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,800
and I said, well, you know, I

983
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,800
felt I had to answer it.

984
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,800
And I said, yes, it was.

985
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,800
And he just shrugged his shoulders.

986
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,800
I know he deplored it.

987
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,800
There was a strong Greek

988
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
community on the campus at the

989
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,800
time that I was here.

990
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
And there was a kind of a social

991
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
division between the independence

992
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
and the Greeks.

993
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,800
And that division seemed to

994
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,800
extend into honor societies as

995
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
well.

996
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
People were voted for membership.

997
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,800
And you know, in retrospect,

998
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
it's utterly ridiculous to think

999
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
that somebody who is academically

1000
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,800
well qualified would be

1001
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,800
not voted into an organization for

1002
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,800
personality reasons.

1003
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,800
I like Henry Gilbert.

1004
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,800
We got along just fine.

1005
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,800
And he didn't have the shy,

1006
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,800
respectful attitude that maybe

1007
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,800
these people expected he should have.

1008
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
But that was very upsetting to

1009
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
Earl Gilbert.

1010
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Another thing about the

1011
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Gilberts, once a year,

1012
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
they invited the chemistry department

1013
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
to dinner at their house.

1014
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,800
But there's the faculty and

1015
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,800
there's spouses.

1016
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
And there was always a very nice

1017
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
dinner.

1018
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Now, the Gilberts were tea

1019
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,800
totalers.

1020
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,800
No alcohol was served.

1021
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,800
Tomatoes were served instead.

1022
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,800
And that was all well and good.

1023
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Everybody understood this.

1024
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Then the Gilberts went off.

1025
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,800
I think that may have been one

1026
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
summer.

1027
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,800
They took a trip to France.

1028
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
And they came back.

1029
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,800
And Wendell's label,

1030
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
a good friend of mine,

1031
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
was hosting a dinner party.

1032
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,800
And he asked, Elise and I were

1033
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,800
invited as were the Gilberts and

1034
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
some other people in physical chemistry.

1035
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,800
And it was a very nice dinner.

1036
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
And Wendell asked me ahead of time.

1037
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,800
He says, do you think I should

1038
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,800
offer people a

1039
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,800
cherry or a drink or a wine

1040
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,800
with dinner?

1041
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
And I said, well,

1042
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,800
it's your party.

1043
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Why not?

1044
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,800
And the Gilberts, as I say,

1045
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
just come back from this trip in France.

1046
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
So Wendell and Duke,

1047
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
of course, asked everybody what they

1048
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
did for her and Earl Gilbert said,

1049
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,800
well, I'll have a glass of

1050
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
tomato juice.

1051
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,800
And his wife,

1052
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
said, I think I'd like some

1053
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
cherry.

1054
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,800
I thought, Gilbert wins.

1055
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,800
And she had a glass of

1056
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,800
cherry on the conversation and

1057
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,800
she said, my that was nice,

1058
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,800
cherry.

1059
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
I liked that very much.

1060
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
And Gilbert modeled,

1061
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,800
and I liked my tomato juice too.

1062
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,800
I understood that I don't

1063
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
know where I got this information,

1064
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
but I understood that as they

1065
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
traveled through France,

1066
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
they did drink wine,

1067
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
because that's about the only

1068
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
thing that you would be

1069
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
served at a meal.

1070
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,800
And maybe that's how Mrs.

1071
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
Gilbert, just for the moment,

1072
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
I can't remember her name,

1073
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,800
but it'll come to me.

1074
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
They were nice people.

1075
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,800
I liked them.

1076
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,800
Well, the next person on my

1077
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
list is Linda Slavo.

1078
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
Oh.

1079
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Linda was a remarkable person.

1080
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I held him in the highest regard,

1081
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
not when I first came,

1082
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,800
but later on.

1083
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,800
When I first came,

1084
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,800
did I mention that there was

1085
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Christensen became chairman after

1086
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Gilbert, but that was not

1087
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
without a hitch in the

1088
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
proceedings.

1089
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
Have I ever mentioned that?

1090
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,800
Well, for some gone for

1091
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
sake and reason,

1092
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,800
it was determined that the

1093
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,800
department should not only

1094
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
elect, which was reasonable

1095
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,800
enough that should vote for who

1096
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,800
they would propose the department

1097
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
chairman.

1098
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Of course, that was non-binding

1099
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
because the dean is the one

1100
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,800
who makes a decision.

1101
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,800
But one of the things for some

1102
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
reason, nobody seems to remember

1103
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
this, but me, I'll have to dig

1104
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,800
out my records.

1105
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,800
The department decided it was

1106
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
going to have a constitution.

1107
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,800
Democracy was going to rule.

1108
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
Now, if you think about that,

1109
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,800
how ridiculous can you imagine

1110
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,800
you can't run a department

1111
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
as a democracy with a

1112
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,800
legislation that determines things.

1113
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
You've got to have a department

1114
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
chairman that makes things happen.

1115
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
You know, that was at me.

1116
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,800
Slayball ran for he came

1117
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
around, and I was new at this

1118
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,800
time, a longer Tom Parsons,

1119
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,800
and I knew that he was a

1120
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
candidate. He came around,

1121
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,800
and very subtle way was

1122
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,800
discussing this.

1123
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,800
And Christensen was the

1124
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,800
heir apparent.

1125
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,800
As I explained, Berncello

1126
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,800
then was the dean, and they

1127
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,800
were good friends.

1128
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,800
And everybody expected that

1129
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Christensen, as the oldest

1130
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
and most experienced and

1131
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
longest serving department

1132
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
member, would become chairman.

1133
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
He was a good scientist.

1134
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
He did hard work, and he's one

1135
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
of the few people who were

1136
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
regularly publishing at Oregon

1137
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,800
state at that time.

1138
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
Well, Slayball was running

1139
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,800
also, and it was determined that

1140
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,800
the person who won the elections

1141
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,800
name would go forward.

1142
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,800
Now, I don't remember whether

1143
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
Slayball won this election.

1144
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
I don't know how many votes were

1145
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,800
cast, maybe 20, all told, or

1146
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,800
30, won the election by one vote.

1147
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,800
And all hell broke loose.

1148
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
You know, Christensen was

1149
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
terribly upset.

1150
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,800
And as Slayball told me

1151
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,800
later, he was invited over

1152
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,800
to a dean's office.

1153
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
I don't know whether it was

1154
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
Shullam and there's someone else.

1155
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
And sat down and talked to

1156
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
in a friendly manner by this

1157
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,800
official to point it out that

1158
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,800
he was a young man and that

1159
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,800
the department would undoubtedly

1160
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,800
run better if somebody

1161
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
with long experience was

1162
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,800
chairman.

1163
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
And as a young man, he would have

1164
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
plenty of chances to rise through

1165
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,800
the hierarchy into administrative

1166
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,800
position.

1167
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,800
And Slayball, reading the handwriting

1168
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,800
on the wall, just then announced

1169
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,800
that he was withdrawing his name

1170
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
from consideration.

1171
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
That was his public statement,

1172
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
but his private feelings I

1173
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,800
have relayed to you.

1174
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,800
So, Christensen became chairman.

1175
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,800
And I think he always had that

1176
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,800
what do I want to call it,

1177
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,800
feeling of having been rejected

1178
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,800
hanging over him for a long time

1179
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,800
so he stole very hard to be

1180
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
what he thought would be a good

1181
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,800
chairman.

1182
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,800
And I could tell you about that

1183
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,800
also.

1184
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,800
But Slayball was a distinguished

1185
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
teacher.

1186
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,800
His lectures were very popular.

1187
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,800
And he had a most original mind.

1188
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,800
He did unusual things.

1189
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,800
He built himself a,

1190
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,800
it was rare at that time.

1191
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
A three-wheeled bicycle

1192
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,800
with enclosed and

1193
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,800
a canopy over the top,

1194
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,800
which had plastic windows

1195
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,800
in front, so he was shielded

1196
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,800
from the wind.

1197
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,800
And he would pedal this thing

1198
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,800
to work and add a little flag

1199
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,800
up the back,

1200
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
just as if you see some

1201
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,800
of the handicapped people

1202
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,800
using these today.

1203
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,800
Not him.

1204
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,800
He had this.

1205
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,800
Later on, he built something

1206
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
similar.

1207
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,800
And he put a motor on it.

1208
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,800
It was an electric motor

1209
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,800
and operated by a battery.

1210
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,800
He billed all himself.

1211
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,800
He lived on,

1212
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,800
on Grant's street,

1213
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,800
up about

1214
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,800
thirty-fourth street

1215
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,800
on the right-hand side.

1216
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
And he had hedges there.

1217
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,800
And he trimmed these hedges.

1218
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,800
So what is the

1219
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,800
art form known when you cut

1220
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,800
these in the form of shapes

1221
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
and animals?

1222
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,800
He meticulously groomed

1223
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
these plants and he had one

1224
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,800
sitting there that had wheels

1225
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
on it and a canopy

1226
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,800
and a steering wheel.

1227
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
Just one bush that had been

1228
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,800
sculpted into that shape.

1229
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
Others he sculpted

1230
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,800
into animal shapes.

1231
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,800
And then in his driveway

1232
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,800
which slipped down to the street,

1233
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
he painted one

1234
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,800
of the very famous

1235
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,800
what's the guy's name

1236
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,800
who does these peculiar

1237
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,800
drawings

1238
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,800
they're famous now.

1239
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,800
He's a famous artist.

1240
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,800
The water that runs up

1241
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,800
pill without seeming to do

1242
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,800
some.

1243
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Yes, sir.

1244
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,800
Yes, sir.

1245
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,800
He painted the black

1246
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,800
and white doves

1247
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,800
that meshed together

1248
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,800
and are going down to the sidewalk.

1249
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,800
He billed outside a bench

1250
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
into the wall.

1251
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,800
His yard sloped down

1252
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,800
to a concrete area there.

1253
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,800
And he billed a bench

1254
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,800
in there, a wood.

1255
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
And it says,

1256
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,800
I don't remember the Italian

1257
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
words exactly

1258
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
or the pronunciation,

1259
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,800
but it's in a sense

1260
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,800
that something

1261
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,800
came out of their public

1262
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,800
or for the convenience

1263
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,800
of the public.

1264
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,800
We got to know him

1265
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
and his wife

1266
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,800
very well.

1267
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Later on,

1268
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
we saw them socially

1269
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,800
a good deal.

1270
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,800
And Louis,

1271
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,800
his wife, was a very

1272
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
nice lady.

1273
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,800
Wendell,

1274
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,800
he had this nice house.

1275
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,800
He had an idea.

1276
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
He went down to the GT

1277
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,800
one time.

1278
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,800
And he bought

1279
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
or brought.

1280
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,800
I think he was

1281
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,800
they were given

1282
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
to him a number

1283
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,800
of plates

1284
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,800
which were used

1285
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,800
in printing,

1286
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
which were all black

1287
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,800
on the top.

1288
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Perhaps a glass

1289
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,800
or something.

1290
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
I don't know.

1291
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,800
But he bought a whole bunch

1292
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,800
of these

1293
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,800
and he billed himself a box

1294
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,800
on his roof.

1295
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,800
And he bought

1296
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,800
of these things

1297
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,800
so the sun would hit it.

1298
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
And he slowly circulated

1299
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
air through this,

1300
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
which he then arranged

1301
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,800
to be pumped down

1302
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,800
into his house.

1303
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,800
And he still had

1304
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,800
to have a furnace,

1305
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,800
of course.

1306
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,800
But he said,

1307
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,800
this noticeably

1308
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,800
reduced his heating costs.

1309
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,800
Then in later years,

1310
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,800
he would quit early

1311
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,800
and he said,

1312
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,800
I need some exercise

1313
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
and we'd go home.

1314
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,800
And I discovered

1315
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,800
he was digging a huge

1316
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,800
sister in his yard.

1317
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,800
And I saw this thing

1318
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
being constructed

1319
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
and he had great lines

1320
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,800
and back too.

1321
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,800
It wasn't a big yard,

1322
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
but he had great lines as well.

1323
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,800
And when this was completed,

1324
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
you know,

1325
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,800
we were up there a dinner

1326
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,800
one time.

1327
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
She says, come and see my sister

1328
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
and it was just completed.

1329
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,800
And I looked down

1330
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,800
and this down thing.

1331
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,800
It was about eight feet

1332
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,800
across and it was

1333
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,800
at least eight feet tall.

1334
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
It was a huge thing

1335
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
and he dug it all

1336
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,800
by hand,

1337
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
made the lining

1338
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,800
and everything in it.

1339
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,800
Concrete it

1340
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,800
all up

1341
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,800
and so on.

1342
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,800
And he said, there it is.

1343
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
He says, he's going

1344
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,800
to start filling it.

1345
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
He says, let's go down

1346
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,800
and he had a ladder

1347
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
built on the side.

1348
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
So we went down.

1349
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
We sat down

1350
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
and a couple chairs

1351
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
in the bottom,

1352
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
while he described this sister

1353
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
into me.

1354
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
So then we went upstairs

1355
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
and he covered it

1356
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,800
and he piped all the water

1357
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,800
that fell on his roof.

1358
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
All of that went

1359
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
into the sister

1360
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
and which he then

1361
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
pumped out to water

1362
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
his garden.

1363
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
The front lawn

1364
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,800
and the vines

1365
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,800
and back, everything.

1366
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,800
And then the city then

1367
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,800
had an assessment

1368
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,800
for storm for drainage.

1369
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
So he went down to the city

1370
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,800
and said he wanted to have

1371
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,800
his drainage reduced

1372
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
because the property

1373
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
was not as big

1374
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
as they said it was

1375
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
and he gave him an estimate

1376
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,800
of the square footage

1377
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,800
of the roof on his house

1378
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,800
and he wanted

1379
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
his proportional reduction

1380
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
in his drainage sheet.

1381
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,800
The city would have no

1382
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,800
nothing to do with this.

1383
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
At which point he realized

1384
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
that this drainage

1385
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,800
was really a tax

1386
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,800
on the amount of land

1387
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,800
that you had,

1388
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,800
not really on.

1389
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,800
It disguised the way he

1390
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,800
put it to me.

1391
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,800
So that was Wendell.

1392
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,800
He died of a heart attack

1393
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,800
in his sleep.

1394
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,800
And it was a tragic thing.

1395
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,800
Lois was very upset

1396
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,800
and she continued

1397
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,800
to live in the house

1398
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
for quite a while.

1399
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
And she would come

1400
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,800
to our house regularly

1401
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,800
and we would go

1402
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
up there to dinner

1403
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,800
and she came to us

1404
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
for dinner.

1405
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,800
And I did some work

1406
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,800
a little work

1407
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,800
in our house

1408
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,800
for her.

1409
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,800
I repaired the toilet

1410
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
that was leaking

1411
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,800
around the seam at the bottom.

1412
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,800
I put a new boot in it

1413
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
and I drilled a hole in the door

1414
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,800
and put one of these viewports

1415
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
in it for a few things

1416
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,800
like that.

1417
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,800
And she developed an infection

1418
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
that by the time it was diagnosed,

1419
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,800
her condition was so poor

1420
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
that she even had to treatment

1421
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
that she couldn't recover

1422
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
and she eventually died

1423
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
from it.

1424
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,800
Not the infection,

1425
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
but the fact that she had no

1426
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,800
reserves left.

1427
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,800
So I was,

1428
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,800
that's the story

1429
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
of the labels that I know.

1430
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,800
They had one son

1431
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
who is in California still.

1432
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
He has no children

1433
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
and he is an orthopedic surgeon.

1434
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
He had a daughter named Jane

1435
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,800
who babysits our kids

1436
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,800
when they were small.

1437
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
And she became for reasons

1438
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
that were never entirely

1439
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,800
clear to me as strange

1440
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,800
from her mother.

1441
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,800
And she lives in Seattle.

1442
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,800
She was married

1443
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,800
and then divorced.

1444
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,800
And I think I've seen her once

1445
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
up there, but I don't know

1446
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,800
what's become of her since then.

1447
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,800
That's about what I know

1448
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,800
of the labels.

1449
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Oh yes.

1450
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Well,

1451
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Bert very much wanted people

1452
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,800
to realize that

1453
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
convinced people he was

1454
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,800
a very good department chairman

1455
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
and we have in the chemistry department

1456
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
at that time we have a

1457
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,800
source of chemicals.

1458
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,800
Let's call it a storeroom.

1459
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
There's a lot of chemicals used

1460
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,800
and that time an organic chemistry

1461
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
and so on was a big supply

1462
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
and he would buy these

1463
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,800
milk and they would be

1464
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,800
repackaged in jars

1465
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,800
and labeled with a number

1466
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,800
and so on on them.

1467
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,800
And other departments

1468
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,800
that couldn't afford a

1469
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,800
storeroom like this,

1470
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
this would be sold to them.

1471
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,800
At the price

1472
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,800
that was listed or maybe

1473
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,800
just a trifle less of the price

1474
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
listed for the same

1475
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,800
size container

1476
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,800
of the same material

1477
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,800
and chemicals catalog.

1478
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,800
And by buying it both

1479
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,800
and repackaging it,

1480
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,800
we saved money.

1481
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,800
He made money.

1482
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,800
And that money was used

1483
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
to support various things

1484
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,800
to realize on those days

1485
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,800
there was almost no money

1486
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
for anything.

1487
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,800
If you wanted to replace

1488
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
the equipment,

1489
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
you know, it was like pulling

1490
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,800
teats to get any money

1491
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
from the university for that.

1492
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,800
He would proceed

1493
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,800
in the department

1494
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,800
and to keep us just

1495
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,800
at least hanging on.

1496
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,800
The trouble with this was

1497
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,800
that this money which

1498
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,800
went into a car

1499
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,800
had to be spent

1500
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
by the 30th of June.

1501
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,800
And sometimes

1502
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,800
Christmas was very frugal.

1503
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,800
He would get all this stuff

1504
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,800
piled up there and then

1505
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,800
he didn't have a way

1506
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,800
of spending it before the end.

1507
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,800
So all sorts of peculiar

1508
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,800
things happened.

1509
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,800
He came down to me one time

1510
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
and says, can how do you like

1511
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,800
to have your office painted?

1512
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
I said, my office painted.

1513
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
I don't need my office painted.

1514
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,800
And he said, well, you know,

1515
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,800
it looks a little dingy in here.

1516
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,800
We should paint a few of these offices

1517
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,800
and just shrugged

1518
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,800
and so my office was painted.

1519
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,800
And that used up some of the money.

1520
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
He says, you know, I don't like to look

1521
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,800
at all these pipes overhead.

1522
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,800
In the basement, everything was open.

1523
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
All sorts of vents and pipes

1524
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
that looked terrible.

1525
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
He says, I think, well, how would you

1526
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
react to the idea

1527
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
that we put a false ceiling

1528
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,800
in a masculine stuff?

1529
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,800
I said, well, can do it if you want.

1530
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
I don't see the need for it.

1531
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
In fact, it improves

1532
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,800
the appearance of things,

1533
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
but it also makes it

1534
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
more difficult to locate the source of problems.

1535
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,800
So a new course,

1536
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
we have that false ceiling,

1537
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
which if you go into the basement of Gilbert,

1538
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
you can see it's still there.

1539
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,800
It's got holes punched in it.

1540
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,800
It's white panels suspended

1541
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
from the ceiling.

1542
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,800
So,

1543
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
Burke was very,

1544
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,800
very conscious of

1545
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,800
how I want to say.

1546
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,800
He was recovering his tracks all the time.

1547
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
And one of the reasons

1548
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
that he refused to renew,

1549
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,800
my wife's appointment,

1550
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,800
had nothing at all to do with science,

1551
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,800
anything like that.

1552
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,800
She was paid very modestly

1553
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
on any event.

1554
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,800
But, for the first time in history,

1555
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,800
just before he took this action,

1556
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,800
the city of Corvallis

1557
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,800
defeated a bond measure

1558
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,800
designed to support schools.

1559
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
And he thought,

1560
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,800
boy,

1561
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,800
people are looking at what

1562
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,800
the education system is doing

1563
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,800
and here they're going to see

1564
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
if there's a faculty member's wife

1565
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
who's being paid on a faculty member,

1566
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
being paid through the system.

1567
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
Of course, my grants were

1568
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
to the university and they were paid.

1569
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
And he decided he couldn't tolerate

1570
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,800
the possibility

1571
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,800
of somebody objecting to this.

1572
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
And that was the reason

1573
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
that he advanced

1574
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,800
to me. He says,

1575
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
we have to be very careful

1576
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
of our image.

1577
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
He advanced to Lisa.

1578
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
I didn't have anything to do with it.

1579
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
She wrote him a letter,

1580
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
went to see him, wrote him another letter,

1581
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
and nothing happened.

1582
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Finally, he refused to answer her letters

1583
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
and that's when we went

1584
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
over to the dean.

1585
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
But I remember a remark,

1586
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
he was a gruffle guy

1587
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
and he spoke

1588
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,800
down like this. He says,

1589
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,800
he says, bird is sort of

1590
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,800
like a country horse.

1591
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
He shies it a paper

1592
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
in the road.

1593
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,800
So that's bird.

1594
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,800
He contributed

1595
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
after he retired.

1596
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
He sent up a fund

1597
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
designed to help graduate students

1598
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
meetings

1599
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,800
when they were working in research

1600
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
with research groups for which

1601
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
there was no money.

1602
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,800
And that was used quite a lot

1603
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
and I

1604
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
thanked him a couple of times

1605
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,800
when I saw him on the streets

1606
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
and he says, oh, well,

1607
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,800
please, he says, if he need

1608
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
more money, let me know.

1609
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
And I don't know whether he put

1610
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
more money up or not.

1611
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,800
I was not the department gentleman.

1612
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,800
So that's a brilliant gentleman.

1613
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,800
I don't

1614
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,800
remember much about

1615
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
WERN

1616
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,800
on the same

1617
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
personal or intimate basis

1618
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
that I mentioned to these other people

1619
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
because he was sitting in the dean's office

1620
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,800
at the time.

1621
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,800
Well, when I first came here,

1622
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,800
he was said of something

1623
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
like the research institute.

1624
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,800
And it turned out

1625
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,800
in the early days

1626
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
there was a group of biochemists

1627
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
associated with chemistry

1628
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
among who

1629
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,800
was

1630
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
Sheldon.

1631
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
And he decided

1632
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
that he would like to

1633
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,800
set up this independent entity.

1634
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,800
There are lots of reasons for it

1635
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,800
because overhead that was returned

1636
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,800
to these

1637
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,800
agencies.

1638
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,800
At that time, the university returned

1639
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,800
part of the overhead to the departments.

1640
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
And the departments then could

1641
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
determine how they were going to use this

1642
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,800
returned overhead.

1643
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,800
Well, I think WERN had some

1644
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,800
conditions.

1645
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,800
Clearly, he did.

1646
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
He was a nice guy, by the way.

1647
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,800
He arranged,

1648
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
I'm sure, with the support of

1649
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
Chris and Sun,

1650
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,800
to take these biochemists

1651
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,800
and to set up what they call

1652
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
the Science Research Institute,

1653
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,800
which was largely biochemistry.

1654
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,800
And then later on,

1655
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,800
that became,

1656
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
I think,

1657
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,800
kind of morphed

1658
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,800
into,

1659
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,800
along with perhaps

1660
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,800
other departments.

1661
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,800
I'm not quite sure

1662
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
about chemistry and bio physics.

1663
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,800
And then WERN became

1664
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,800
department chef,

1665
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,800
and became D.

1666
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,800
Pardon me.

1667
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,800
He suffered from health problems,

1668
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,800
serious ones.

1669
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
He had very high blood pressure

1670
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,800
at one stage,

1671
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
and he died really rather young.

1672
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
His life was

1673
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
very well known,

1674
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
also,

1675
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,800
because I range, her name was

1676
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
I range,

1677
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,800
but I think she served

1678
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,800
she was certainly involved

1679
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
in local politics.

1680
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,800
And I don't know whether

1681
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,800
she'll in the middle school

1682
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,800
is, they were philanthropic,

1683
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,800
also.

1684
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,800
Whether that followed

1685
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,800
mostly from her work,

1686
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,800
or from them jointly as

1687
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,800
they were.

1688
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,800
So that's about as much as I

1689
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,800
know, WERN.

1690
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,800
I'd see him on the street

1691
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,800
when she had cans

1692
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
and chat a bit,

1693
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
and then I had this,

1694
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,800
at least, and I had this

1695
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,800
contact with him in occasion

1696
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,800
of her appointment.

1697
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
And that's about all I had to do

1698
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,800
with him.

1699
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,800
Well, Carol is

1700
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,800
a wonderful guy.

1701
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
And I think he's

1702
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,800
very proud of him as one of the,

1703
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,800
certainly one of the better

1704
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,800
chairman's that I have

1705
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,800
experienced here.

1706
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Carol had a research program

1707
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
in inorganic chemistry

1708
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,800
when I first came.

1709
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,800
And he decided he would

1710
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,800
whatever reason.

1711
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,800
I think his research was

1712
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,800
slowing down that he would

1713
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,800
run for department chairman.

1714
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,800
And I think that there were

1715
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,800
two choices.

1716
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,800
One of them was

1717
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
Dara Thomas.

1718
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,800
And the other was

1719
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,800
Carol.

1720
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,800
And I think the ultimate decision

1721
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,800
was made by the dean

1722
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,800
that it would be Dara Thomas.

1723
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,800
And after he served for

1724
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,800
a term, Carol became

1725
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,800
department chairman.

1726
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
Now,

1727
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,800
Carol,

1728
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,800
he really ran the department

1729
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,800
the way that a lot of us

1730
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,800
would like to see it done.

1731
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
He once professed to me,

1732
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,800
he says, look, he says, my research

1733
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
days are over. I view

1734
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
my role in this department

1735
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
as to expedite the research

1736
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
and teaching potential

1737
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
of the department to the

1738
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,800
maximum possible.

1739
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,800
And so he was

1740
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,800
the difference between him

1741
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
and Christensen's

1742
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,800
and say to choose an example.

1743
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,800
Christensen, you couldn't

1744
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,800
pry a dime out of it.

1745
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,800
Until the end,

1746
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
when you saw this

1747
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
flamboyant expenditures being

1748
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
made, I'd go to Carol

1749
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
and I'd say, look, I need some

1750
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
money from my returned overhead

1751
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,800
by the way.

1752
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,800
In those days, the department

1753
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
received returned overhead

1754
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,800
but the department

1755
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
to determine what they did

1756
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
with the overhead. And our department had a practice

1757
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
of returning about

1758
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
80% of the overhead

1759
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
that was derived from

1760
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,800
the research grant of an individual

1761
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
to that individual.

1762
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
So if you had a big research

1763
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
grant of which a

1764
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
lot of overhead was

1765
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
extracted, returned to the department,

1766
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
then you would have a chunk of money

1767
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
to deal with because I think

1768
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,800
they returned 80% or so

1769
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
and you could use that any way you

1770
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,800
want. Now,

1771
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
what happened was that

1772
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
a notice would be sent about

1773
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,800
that returned overhead was now

1774
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
available and you should

1775
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
write down what your needs are.

1776
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,800
Now, it wasn't that

1777
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
the overhead was

1778
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,800
directed specifically to the

1779
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
individual who had earned it.

1780
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,800
But that would

1781
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
receive some priority.

1782
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
But a lot of us didn't need

1783
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
all of our overhead and so we

1784
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,800
build up formally speaking

1785
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,800
an account.

1786
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
Other people who needed

1787
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,800
equipment that exceeded the

1788
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
returned overhead could use the

1789
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,800
returned overhead and then

1790
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,800
you would have a credit so to speak.

1791
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,800
Well, of course, it's not a

1792
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
business and

1793
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,800
looking back, a

1794
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,800
perspicacious individual would have

1795
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,800
seen that this can't

1796
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,800
persist and the guys who

1797
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
have the credits are probably

1798
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
never going to realize there

1799
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,800
are money back again.

1800
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
Whereas those guys who are in

1801
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,800
debt, you know, the department is

1802
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,800
going to decide they're not going to

1803
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,800
distribute overhead anymore.

1804
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
And so they come out and

1805
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,800
swim like a rose.

1806
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
Well, I didn't need all of my money

1807
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
because I had equipment budgets

1808
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
and I could buy an

1809
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,800
account.

1810
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,800
Well, I went to him on a couple

1811
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
of occasions saying, I need

1812
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
this or I need that carol and I

1813
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
don't have the money and my budget

1814
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
for it. He says, how much is

1815
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
it? I'd tell him.

1816
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
He'd look at this and he'd say,

1817
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,800
okay, go ahead, buy it.

1818
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,800
And he was very effective in

1819
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
this way and I think people

1820
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,800
respected him for that because

1821
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,800
people didn't go to him to try

1822
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
things they really didn't need.

1823
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
And this isn't keeping with his

1824
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,800
professed remark to me.

1825
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
It's remarked to me that he

1826
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,800
was going to do what he could to

1827
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,800
expedite the teaching and

1828
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
research activities of the

1829
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,800
department. If you needed money for

1830
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,800
your research and you didn't have it,

1831
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,800
he tried to get it for you.

1832
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,800
He was very good.

1833
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
You know, he's still around.

1834
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
We have an old man's lunch

1835
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
once a month.

1836
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,800
Did you know that?

1837
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,800
The old man's lunch started

1838
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,800
way, way back

1839
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,800
in 1986.

1840
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,800
And it started

1841
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,800
with bus marvel,

1842
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
Elliott Marvel, a professor of

1843
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,800
organic chemistry who retired

1844
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,800
and

1845
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,800
he was very ambitious.

1846
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
And it may have been Harry

1847
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,800
Frand also decided they would

1848
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,800
meet for lunch.

1849
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
And then there were probably

1850
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
four of them all told.

1851
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,800
And then when I retired,

1852
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
they decided that I would be

1853
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,800
invited to this and then

1854
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,800
it became a kind of a monthly

1855
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
affair.

1856
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
And as people have retired,

1857
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
that has kept going.

1858
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
So every retiree in

1859
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,800
chemistry,

1860
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
and two or three in biochemistry

1861
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,800
in bio physics,

1862
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,800
Chris Matthews comes,

1863
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,800
Ken Van Holt is a part of it.

1864
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,800
Bob Becker comes,

1865
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
then several chemists come.

1866
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,800
Several chemists who could

1867
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,800
come don't because their active

1868
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
tennis player is still,

1869
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
and they have matches Wednesday

1870
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,800
at noon when we have our meetings

1871
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,800
once a month.

1872
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
And he's a very

1873
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
lively guy.

1874
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,800
He's been very active.

1875
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,800
He bought a house

1876
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,800
on the area road.

1877
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,800
He's been an active

1878
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
kayaker for years.

1879
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
And finally, he decided

1880
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
that the commute

1881
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
for him and his wife was

1882
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,800
just too much.

1883
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
So they sold that property

1884
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,800
to him.

1885
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,800
At least in the process of selling it

1886
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,800
and bought some last year here

1887
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,800
in town where he's now living.

1888
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
But he's still kayaks.

1889
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
In fact, they went down the

1890
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,800
road recently.

1891
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
And he's been on the Grand Canyon

1892
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,800
more than once in his own

1893
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
kayak.

1894
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,800
So he's very active,

1895
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
physically.

1896
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
Wonderful guy.

1897
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,800
What are some of the

1898
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,800
more critical or memorable

1899
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
things that you think

1900
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
about in 10 years?

1901
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,800
What were the status

1902
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,800
teams?

1903
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
A memorable experience is

1904
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,800
working with graduate students.

1905
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,800
Well,

1906
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,800
I'm thinking here as

1907
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,800
I'm sitting.

1908
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,800
I've had

1909
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
some very good graduate students

1910
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,800
and some that were

1911
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
not so good.

1912
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,800
Almost all of whom

1913
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,800
have finished and gotten

1914
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,800
a degree.

1915
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
Let me name one

1916
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,800
who came along fairly late.

1917
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,800
His name was

1918
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
Chin-Fan Huang.

1919
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,800
And he was a Chinese

1920
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
national.

1921
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,800
And he came here

1922
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,800
when, oh,

1923
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
I'd have to look to see,

1924
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,800
he's been almost 20 years

1925
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,800
now.

1926
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
Well, perhaps even more

1927
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,800
than that.

1928
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
From China,

1929
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
when it was still a highly

1930
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,800
restricted place.

1931
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
And he grew up in time

1932
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,800
of the cultural revolution.

1933
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
And by his own

1934
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,800
bootstrapped,

1935
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,800
lifted himself up.

1936
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,800
And he

1937
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,800
became aware of a position

1938
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,800
I had.

1939
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,800
And I don't remember

1940
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,800
the details, but I decided he

1941
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,800
would be a good addition.

1942
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,800
And I think he was coming

1943
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
at the beginning with his own

1944
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,800
money.

1945
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,800
So he arrived.

1946
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,800
And I had several students

1947
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,800
working with me

1948
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,800
at that time.

1949
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,800
And one of these

1950
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,800
was a

1951
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,800
young woman that

1952
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,800
was working away when he showed

1953
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,800
up. And I happened to be

1954
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
away the day he arrived.

1955
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,800
He came into the laboratory.

1956
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,800
This young woman was trying to

1957
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,800
do some work on her

1958
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
computer.

1959
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,800
And he spoke

1960
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
rather poor English

1961
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
language.

1962
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,800
But he was

1963
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,800
as gong-hole as

1964
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,800
they could come.

1965
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,800
And after a while,

1966
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
I think a day or two later

1967
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
this girl came to me

1968
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
and said, I can't stand this

1969
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
guy. She says, over my shoulder

1970
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
all the time. That's me.

1971
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
Also, it's a question.

1972
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
He was so eager.

1973
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,800
Well,

1974
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
by this time I was taking him

1975
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
to enrollment courses.

1976
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,800
And he was a very

1977
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
anxious to start research.

1978
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
And he was dynamic.

1979
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
He was a tremendous

1980
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,800
researcher.

1981
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,800
And he was an older man.

1982
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
And he had had a lot of work

1983
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
in chemistry,

1984
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
even at the theoretical

1985
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
that was very knowledgeable.

1986
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
But he was required

1987
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,800
to fulfill our department

1988
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,800
requirements, of course, for course

1989
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,800
work. And he enrolled

1990
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,800
in theoretical chemistry.

1991
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,800
And he got

1992
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,800
straight-age, no question about it.

1993
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,800
At the end of his

1994
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,800
first year, he was

1995
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,800
hold of the outstanding

1996
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,800
incoming graduate student.

1997
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,800
And then a year later he was

1998
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
hold of the outstanding

1999
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,800
graduate student. And each of

2000
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,800
these carried financial

2001
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,800
stipends, not a great deal, but some.

2002
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,800
And one day he came to me

2003
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,800
and said, you know,

2004
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,800
the Chinese are very

2005
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,800
cognizant of,

2006
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,800
let's say,

2007
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,800
the social hierarchy

2008
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
and the

2009
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
deference which should be

2010
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,800
paid to people who occupy a

2011
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,800
status a little

2012
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,800
more elevated than yours.

2013
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,800
And so he came to me

2014
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,800
having just attended lecture

2015
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
and quantum mechanics

2016
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,800
by one of our faculty members.

2017
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,800
And he said to me,

2018
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,800
very quietly, he said,

2019
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,800
is it all right

2020
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,800
to correct a professor when he's

2021
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,800
wrong?

2022
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,800
And I said,

2023
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,800
yes it is.

2024
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,800
You should tell him

2025
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,800
or raise the issue

2026
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,800
and tell him about it and say

2027
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,800
that you think this is

2028
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,800
the right answer.

2029
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,800
But I'm not quite sure

2030
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,800
he ever followed through on that.

2031
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
Well, he did a

2032
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,800
lot of work. And then

2033
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,800
at the end of his

2034
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,800
graduation he got his degree.

2035
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,800
He worked for a while with

2036
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,800
Doug Kessler in chemistry.

2037
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,800
And then

2038
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,800
a colleague of mine that

2039
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,800
Michigan named Larry Bartel

2040
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
was looking for somebody and I

2041
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,800
recommended him

2042
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,800
and of course he shows up

2043
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,800
and Larry isn't doing quite the same

2044
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,800
kind of work that I am.

2045
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,800
And Larry has a very

2046
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,800
abrasive, uh,

2047
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,800
no nonsense personality.

2048
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
But I think he met his

2049
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,800
match in Geneva and

2050
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
Juan.

2051
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
Because he would tell Juan to

2052
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
do something and Juan would do it.

2053
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
But then he would point out he could

2054
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,800
do it better this way.

2055
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,800
And he would do it that way.

2056
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
So it turns out that

2057
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
now Juan was married

2058
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
and he could hardly wait

2059
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,800
to come to this country.

2060
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,800
And finally he arranged

2061
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,800
so that she could come.

2062
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
And they had two children,

2063
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,800
two boys,

2064
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
which is, of course,

2065
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,800
out of the line there.

2066
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,800
At any rate, the first thing

2067
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
that the woman came, he wanted

2068
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,800
her here so she could cook

2069
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800
and he could spend more time

2070
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
doing research.

2071
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,800
And he enrolled his son

2072
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,800
I guess both kids,

2073
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,800
but I don't remember

2074
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,800
so much about the younger.

2075
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
Anyway, he was very distressed

2076
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,800
because after a while the

2077
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,800
younger son was not

2078
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,800
washing home after school

2079
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,800
and spending the rest of the

2080
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
afternoon studying, the son

2081
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
became quite used to American

2082
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
manners. And he liked the

2083
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,800
social life and so on.

2084
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
And this distressed his father

2085
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,800
immensely, who expected

2086
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,800
a problem. And I said,

2087
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
Jim Phan, I said,

2088
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
how's your son doing?

2089
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,800
Well, he could do better.

2090
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,800
He could come home and he could

2091
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,800
be studying advanced things.

2092
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,800
And I said, well, how are his

2093
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,800
grades? He said, what grades?

2094
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,800
I said, well, what are the

2095
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
marks? He gets the courses.

2096
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,800
He says, well, he gets all

2097
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
A's. So it wasn't an

2098
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,800
upper Jim Phan that his kid was

2099
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,800
excelling by American standards.

2100
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,800
He went on. His wife had to

2101
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,800
go home or be sex barred.

2102
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,800
And then he learned

2103
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
after she'd been home a long

2104
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,800
time that she was pregnant.

2105
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,800
At which time he immediately

2106
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,800
divorced her.

2107
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,800
That's unknown all there you

2108
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,800
see. And I think I don't

2109
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,800
know whether his sons had gone

2110
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
back or whether they stayed with

2111
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
him here or not. I just don't

2112
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:13,800
know that. But then you

2113
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,800
began to look for a new wife.

2114
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,800
And this is kind of a male

2115
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,800
order of proposition. And so I

2116
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,800
don't know how the Chinese do

2117
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,800
it traditionally. But at any

2118
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,800
rate, he found some woman

2119
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,800
in Shanghai and he went to

2120
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,800
visit her. And I think they

2121
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,800
eventually married.

2122
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,800
And she's a little more modern

2123
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,800
life than he was. And she

2124
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,800
joined even Minnesota. And I

2125
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,800
think they're still there.

2126
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,800
I don't know whether they

2127
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,800
have any children together or

2128
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,800
not. But he found a job in

2129
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,800
an industry and an

2130
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,800
arbor. But he still works

2131
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,800
weekends in Larry Bartel's

2132
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:57,800
laboratory. So he's the most

2133
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:01,800
notable graduate student from

2134
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,800
several points of view that I've

2135
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,800
had postdocs that are even

2136
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,800
just as remarkable, one from

2137
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,800
Japan in particular. We're

2138
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,800
getting on here. How long do you

2139
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,800
want to go? I can go a

2140
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,800
lot longer if you'd like.

2141
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,800
Well, let me talk about one of

2142
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,800
my postdocs. I mean, I have a

2143
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,800
host of graduate students and each

2144
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,800
one of those has got his own

2145
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,800
personalities. And some have been

2146
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,800
very productive, some less

2147
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,800
productive. But I want to

2148
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,800
mention something that I think

2149
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,800
is a remarkable

2150
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,800
life or parallel lives.

2151
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,800
There was a distinguished

2152
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,800
professor named Yoneso Morino

2153
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,800
in Japan at the

2154
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,800
University of Tokyo. And in

2155
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,800
1960, I think it was

2156
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,800
1962. But at any

2157
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,800
rate, I had a

2158
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,800
role letter. I was looking

2159
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,800
for a postdoc role

2160
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,800
appointee. Yone

2161
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,800
as he was called Morino. We

2162
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,800
became friends and I've seen

2163
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,800
him all over the world at

2164
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,800
meetings in Norway and other

2165
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,800
places. He wrote to me about

2166
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,800
his student named Machio

2167
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,800
Iwasaki, who would like to

2168
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,800
study. And he could

2169
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,800
recommend him. Well, now

2170
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,800
Machio came to the United

2171
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,800
States, having gotten his

2172
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,800
doctorate in Japan. And he

2173
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,800
was phenomenal. He was a

2174
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:55,800
superb mathematician, an

2175
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,800
excellent experimentalist. He

2176
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,800
had only rudimentary

2177
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,800
English. But I spoke slowly

2178
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,800
and he could understand me, and

2179
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,800
I could understand him. Well, it

2180
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,800
turned out that when he knew

2181
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,800
he would be coming to the United

2182
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,800
States in three months, he had

2183
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,800
had no English experience at

2184
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,800
all. And of course, he had

2185
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,800
essentially no money. They

2186
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,800
don't have money at his

2187
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,800
time. And so he went

2188
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:33,800
in Hawk and enrolled

2189
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,800
in a crash course in

2190
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,800
English language. And he

2191
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,800
managed to get enough English

2192
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,800
so that he could speak to me in

2193
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,800
English in three months'

2194
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,800
time. Now that's very

2195
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
it's not so hard for a

2196
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,800
Western speaking person to do

2197
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,800
this. The company uses so

2198
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,800
different that it's a tour

2199
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,800
to force. He became much

2200
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,800
better as time went along. So

2201
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,800
he asked me to help him

2202
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,800
find a place to live, which I

2203
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,800
did. And it was very

2204
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,800
satisfactory. It was very

2205
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,800
low level. But I mean, after

2206
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,800
all, he was here to do research. He

2207
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,800
had his wife with him. He had

2208
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:17,800
no children. And a few weeks

2209
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
later, he came to me, he said,

2210
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:23,800
did I know a doctor? He said, well,

2211
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,800
it's probably says my wife has terrible

2212
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,800
pains in her legs and so on.

2213
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,800
And we'd better see a doctor.

2214
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,800
And so I gave him the name of a

2215
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,800
doctor that we had used for our kids.

2216
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:41,800
And he came to me the next day and

2217
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,800
he said, oh, I didn't need the doctor.

2218
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,800
We solved the problem. The problem was

2219
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,800
that never in Japan had this woman

2220
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,800
been sitting in chairs. She had

2221
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,800
always been in the Japanese

2222
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,800
traditional position on her

2223
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,800
knees and legs with her feet back

2224
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,800
like this. The minute she started

2225
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,800
to do that, all her pains

2226
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,800
disappeared. So she could sit on

2227
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,800
the chairs intermittently and sooner

2228
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,800
later, the problem vanished.

2229
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,800
Another time it came to me and

2230
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,800
says, I need to have vitamins,

2231
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
do you know where I can get vitamins?

2232
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,800
I said, oh, yeah, you can find them in any

2233
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,800
store. And he then told me, well,

2234
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,800
he didn't mean that kind. I said, well,

2235
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,800
what kind of vitamins do you mean?

2236
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,800
He says, I want the, he says, I take

2237
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,800
vitamins, but I inject them.

2238
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,800
And I said, well, people don't inject

2239
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,800
vitamins here. You can take them orally.

2240
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,800
And on another

2241
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,800
time he came to me and said that, well,

2242
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,800
he spent a year, then he asked me if

2243
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,800
he could continue another year and I said,

2244
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,800
yes, of course you can't.

2245
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,800
So he worked very hard and then he came

2246
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,800
to me at that year and he said,

2247
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,800
I've been thinking about another

2248
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,800
apartment.

2249
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,800
I said, and he said, I would like to have

2250
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,800
you join me and look at it.

2251
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,800
So it was over

2252
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:03,800
on Western Avenue

2253
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,800
where he had been living on 11th

2254
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,800
Street in an old brick building there

2255
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,800
with the apartment building.

2256
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,800
And so this place was lighter and more

2257
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,800
airy and it seemed to me like a nice

2258
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,800
place and it was cheaper.

2259
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,800
And he seemed very hesitant about it

2260
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,800
and he kept looking at me.

2261
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,800
And then sometime later he said,

2262
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,800
you wouldn't lose face if I move

2263
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,800
here.

2264
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,800
Apparently on his mind because it was

2265
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,800
cheaper, it was a downgrade and

2266
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,800
quiet place.

2267
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,800
And he said, you wouldn't lose face if I

2268
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,800
moved here.

2269
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,800
Apparently on his mind because it was

2270
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,800
cheaper, it was a downgrade and

2271
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,800
quality.

2272
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,800
As a matter of fact, it was an upgrade

2273
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,800
and quality.

2274
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,800
But what is remarkable about this is

2275
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,800
his having been raised in the time

2276
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,800
maybe it still was where face is

2277
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,800
everything.

2278
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Well, the story was incomplete

2279
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,800
without my telling you a little

2280
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,800
bit about his wife who was

2281
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,800
even more remarkable.

2282
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,800
She couldn't take English.

2283
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,800
She knew no English and she came

2284
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,800
here.

2285
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,800
She came from a fairly well

2286
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,800
off Japanese family.

2287
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,800
Very Western whereas

2288
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,800
Macho's family was very

2289
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,800
traditional. His father was an

2290
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,800
old-sea captain.

2291
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,800
And the daughter in law was

2292
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,800
expected to do everything in the house.

2293
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,800
They lived.

2294
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,800
Anyway,

2295
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,800
she did housework

2296
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,800
for no pay with the

2297
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,800
stipulation that the person

2298
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,800
for whom she worked would

2299
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,800
speak only English to her

2300
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,800
and try to help her understand

2301
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,800
the English language.

2302
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,800
And that went on for months

2303
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,800
and she became

2304
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,800
conversational and

2305
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,800
English in a halting way.

2306
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,800
Then, Macho said after his

2307
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,800
first year he says,

2308
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,800
now I want to buy a car,

2309
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,800
I want a car.

2310
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,800
So, he passed the driver's

2311
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,800
license.

2312
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,800
I think he failed it once,

2313
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,800
then passed it.

2314
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,800
Both the written and so on.

2315
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,800
Many's wife said she wanted one.

2316
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,800
But she couldn't read English.

2317
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,800
She could only speak it.

2318
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,800
And of course they give you this

2319
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,800
manual with all the written

2320
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,800
instruction. What the science

2321
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,800
made everything.

2322
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,800
She looked at the manual

2323
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,800
and she went and took the

2324
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,800
written exam and got

2325
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,800
100 percent on it.

2326
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,800
Without being able to read

2327
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,800
any words other than stop

2328
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,800
and slow and knowing what the

2329
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,800
science meant.

2330
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,800
The other thing she did

2331
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,800
earned money,

2332
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,800
they wanted extra money.

2333
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,800
So, she heard herself out

2334
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,800
when the strawberry season came

2335
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,800
around to pick strawberries.

2336
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,800
That was a big thing on

2337
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,800
the big strawberry,

2338
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,800
about twice as fast as anyone

2339
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,800
else because she knew how to

2340
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,800
sit on her horses.

2341
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,800
She could go along like a rabbit

2342
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,800
according to my understanding.

2343
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,800
She could pick these strawberries

2344
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,800
and they were paid

2345
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,800
peaceways for it.

2346
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,800
She made more money than anyone

2347
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,800
else picking strawberries.

2348
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,800
Well, they went back to Japan.

2349
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,800
I visited them there on a

2350
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,800
most remarkable experience one

2351
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,800
time.

2352
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:33,800
What happened to her?

2353
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,800
They moved in with his

2354
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,800
parents and she had to play

2355
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,800
the subservient daughter.

2356
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
When I was there with a friend

2357
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,800
and revisited them we were

2358
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,800
invited to the old people's

2359
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,800
house.

2360
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,800
They wore kimonos.

2361
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,800
As we came in the door we

2362
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,800
were professors, my friend

2363
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,800
and I.

2364
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,800
We had finished the travel.

2365
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,800
That's another story.

2366
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,800
They were on their knees with

2367
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,800
their heads down like this

2368
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,800
because we were professors

2369
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,800
and we were assured

2370
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,800
in.

2371
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,800
But, medical, the wife of

2372
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,800
macho did not eat dinner

2373
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,800
with us. She served us.

2374
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,800
She was in the kitchen all

2375
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,800
the time.

2376
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,800
After the parents died and

2377
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,800
they took over the house

2378
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,800
and they were hungry.

2379
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,800
And as time went on her

2380
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,800
watercolors became very

2381
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,800
well known and then

2382
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,800
finally she became

2383
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,800
famous.

2384
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:39,800
When she died some years

2385
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,800
ago now, not many,

2386
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,800
maybe five.

2387
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,800
She was the most

2388
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,800
talked about watercolors

2389
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,800
in all of Japan.

2390
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,800
There are paintings

2391
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,800
and she made lots of money

2392
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,800
from her painting.

2393
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,800
Just an utterly

2394
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,800
remarkable couple.

2395
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,800
I feel very fortunate to have

2396
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:05,800
known them.

2397
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,800
So he's the most

2398
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,800
remarkable postdoctoral

2399
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:11,800
person I've had

2400
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,800
from these.

2401
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,800
I'm how they're

2402
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,800
people of scientifically

2403
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,800
excellent. Of course, that's

2404
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:20,800
not really what I'm talking about.

2405
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
But in addition to the

2406
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,800
scientific excellence that

2407
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,800
macho had, he had all

2408
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,800
of the other things.

2409
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
They saved money while I

2410
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,800
were here so they could buy

2411
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,800
an American hot water heater

2412
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,800
and send it home

2413
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,800
and install in these

2414
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,800
parents' house so they

2415
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,800
would have hot water.

2416
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,800
And when I came to visit

2417
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,800
them they were very worried

2418
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,800
about the toilet facilities

2419
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,800
because they only had the

2420
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,800
parents on a hole in the floor

2421
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,800
and you had the squat, you see.

2422
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:57,800
So a

2423
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,800
remarkable insight into Japanese

2424
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,800
living.

2425
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,800
The occasion of this,

2426
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,800
I can tell you this visit to Japan

2427
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,800
with macho,

2428
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,800
Autobots Johnson, whom I mentioned

2429
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,800
before, and I were in Japan

2430
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,800
for a meeting.

2431
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,800
And preliminary to that meeting

2432
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,800
we were asked by a macho

2433
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,800
or by some other

2434
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,800
the principal sir.

2435
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,800
Would you like to do something

2436
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,800
ahead of time? And I wrote

2437
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,800
and said, yes, we would like to

2438
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,800
look around Japan a bit

2439
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,800
a week ahead of time. There was a range

2440
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,800
that macho had a car now.

2441
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,800
It was employed by an

2442
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,800
institute and becoming a very

2443
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,800
well-known scientist.

2444
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,800
We took this around in this car.

2445
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,800
And the one thing I said to

2446
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,800
a macho live in any American,

2447
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,800
excuse me,

2448
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,800
or English style

2449
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,800
accommodations. I wanted to see

2450
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,800
what Japan and

2451
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,800
particularly rural Japan was like.

2452
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,800
So as we traveled around for seven days

2453
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,800
he had booked ahead of time

2454
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,800
accommodations and Japanese

2455
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,800
ends. And all the time

2456
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,800
we were traveling on this trip,

2457
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,800
I never saw another

2458
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,800
Caucasian in these ends

2459
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,800
in which we stayed.

2460
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,800
We would come in. There would be a doorstep.

2461
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,800
We would be met with the hostess

2462
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,800
who would bow

2463
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,800
and give us a kimono

2464
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,800
you know.

2465
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,800
And take off our shoes.

2466
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,800
We would be ushered to our room

2467
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,800
and some

2468
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,800
old snack bits

2469
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,800
after our travel would come.

2470
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,800
And then a few minutes later

2471
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,800
the person would come in and say,

2472
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,800
your bath is ready.

2473
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,800
The bath was not a

2474
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,800
shower.

2475
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,800
It was a huge place.

2476
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,800
This is more or less the norm.

2477
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,800
And there was a huge tub

2478
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,800
was about four feet deep

2479
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:55,800
and it would hold four or five people.

2480
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,800
And it was full of

2481
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,800
scalding water.

2482
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,800
Then there,

2483
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,800
away from this tub

2484
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,800
is a tiled area

2485
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,800
with soap along the wall.

2486
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,800
And there is where you

2487
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,800
get yourself. Then you got into the tub

2488
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,800
to soak.

2489
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,800
Then after a while you'd get out again

2490
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,800
and repeat the process.

2491
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,800
That's what a Japanese

2492
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,800
that's what we were treated to.

2493
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,800
Well, then we got out

2494
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,800
and we were sort of

2495
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,800
how do you want to call

2496
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,800
totally relaxed with all of this.

2497
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,800
We had a kimono we came back in.

2498
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,800
This was a Japanese room.

2499
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,800
No beds. Nothing.

2500
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,800
You know, tatami on the floor.

2501
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,800
A rice door.

2502
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,800
And then there would be

2503
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,800
a discreet knock.

2504
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,800
And the horses would come in.

2505
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
Or one of the serving girls

2506
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,800
would come in and her kimono bowing

2507
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,800
like this.

2508
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,800
Set up a little table,

2509
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,800
put the stuff on it,

2510
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,800
and sit there.

2511
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,800
And serve us.

2512
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,800
Pour the sake for us.

2513
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,800
And my Japanese, we didn't begin

2514
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,800
in Japanese, of course.

2515
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,800
But my Japanese friend,

2516
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
who is a Japanese service,

2517
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
we are,

2518
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
it is a part of the process

2519
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,800
to offer her a drink of sake.

2520
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,800
And so we did that,

2521
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,800
and she bowed gracefully

2522
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,800
and drank sake very nicely.

2523
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,800
And then at the end,

2524
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,800
they would plurle us away

2525
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
and then they would haul out the tatami

2526
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,800
that you were going to sleep on,

2527
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,800
bed, so to speak, the roll.

2528
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,800
And that would be put out on the

2529
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
mat on the floor.

2530
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,800
And then we would sleep.

2531
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,800
And every one of these rooms

2532
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,800
was a glass partition

2533
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,800
that opened on to a private,

2534
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,800
very small,

2535
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,800
not bigger than this room.

2536
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,800
Japanese garden beautifully planted

2537
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,800
with plants.

2538
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,800
We went around to a number of these places,

2539
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,800
and on one occasion

2540
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,800
on a Saturday night,

2541
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,800
you know, the Japanese,

2542
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,800
they're way out on the countryside.

2543
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,800
The men leave their family.

2544
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,800
They go out there and they have drunken orgies.

2545
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,800
And one of these places,

2546
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,800
we were on the second floor

2547
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,800
and I looked out the window in the morning.

2548
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,800
And on this beautiful green lawn,

2549
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,800
where a number of recumbent

2550
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,800
forms sound asleep,

2551
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,800
you know, where they had collapsed

2552
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,800
after a night of drinking inside.

2553
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:21,800
The Japanese don't look

2554
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,800
at drunkenness

2555
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,800
in the same way that we do.

2556
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,800
I've walked through Kyoto.

2557
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,800
And there will be a guy lying on the sidewalk.

2558
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,800
The cops come along and very carefully

2559
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,800
picking him up by the armpits,

2560
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,800
dragging up to the wall

2561
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,800
and propping him up right there

2562
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,800
and then walk on.

2563
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:43,800
Well, that's about as much as

2564
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,800
I can tell you on that.

2565
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,800
But that trip

2566
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,800
is something few Americans

2567
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,800
have ever experienced.

2568
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,800
And when I came back to Tokyo,

2569
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,800
Macho said, you know,

2570
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,800
if Lisa had come with you,

2571
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,800
we would have had none of this service.

2572
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,800
Because she would have been expected

2573
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,800
to perform it.

2574
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,800
I told my wife that.

2575
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,800
She said, it's good she didn't come along.

2576
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,800
Yeah.

2577
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:15,800
Well, as you look back

2578
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,800
on your career in science,

2579
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,800
what are some of the things

2580
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,800
that you're most proud of?

2581
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,800
Well, I think the thing

2582
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,800
that I'm most proud

2583
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,800
of Chris is that I've had

2584
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,800
what I think is a very happy life

2585
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,800
and what I've done.

2586
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,800
My childhood was,

2587
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,800
I won't say actually

2588
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,800
impoverished, but we lived

2589
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,800
through the depression

2590
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:45,800
portion of which my father was out of work.

2591
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,800
And the notion that I would have been able

2592
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,800
to do the things

2593
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,800
that I have been able to do

2594
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,800
would have been

2595
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,800
almost unthinkable.

2596
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,800
For example, I've traveled

2597
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,800
all over the world.

2598
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,800
I've made much more money

2599
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:03,800
than my father ever did.

2600
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,800
And I have kids

2601
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,800
that are successful.

2602
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,800
And I've had wonderful colleagues.

2603
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,800
And I've had a research career

2604
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,800
that has kept me occupied

2605
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,800
even to date.

2606
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,800
I don't think I could

2607
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,800
have

2608
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,800
planned it any better, actually,

2609
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,800
if I had had to

2610
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,800
set out ahead of time.

2611
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,800
On the other hand,

2612
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,800
when you look back on a long life,

2613
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,800
you see that there are certain points

2614
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,800
where you've made decisions.

2615
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,800
In retrospect,

2616
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,800
you're very happy with.

2617
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,800
But at the time,

2618
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,800
it was almost a flip of the coin.

2619
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,800
For example,

2620
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,800
I very nearly married somebody

2621
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,800
else before I met Lisa

2622
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,800
and decided not to.

2623
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,800
It was touch and go.

2624
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,800
All life would have been different.

2625
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,800
I wouldn't have had any of the same connections.

2626
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:01,800
And Lisa is a gifted scientist.

2627
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,800
I wouldn't have had anywhere near

2628
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,800
the career I've had

2629
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:07,800
were it

2630
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,800
not for the many contributions

2631
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,800
that she's made to it.

2632
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,800
We sat down last night

2633
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,800
and had a conversation

2634
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,800
about a problem I'm having

2635
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,800
and we came to a conclusion about it.

2636
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,800
So, you know how it is.

2637
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,800
And

2638
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,800
if I'd

2639
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,800
one of my

2640
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,800
I don't know the way I mentioned this,

2641
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,800
maybe I did when I got my

2642
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,800
full bride and

2643
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:35,800
cooking on fellowships to Norway.

2644
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,800
The previous year I had

2645
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,800
applied for a full bride fellowship.

2646
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,800
The application received,

2647
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,800
was received too late.

2648
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,800
If I'd gotten it,

2649
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,800
which I was led to believe I would have,

2650
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,800
if it had been received in time,

2651
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,800
I would have gone to Belgium.

2652
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,800
I would never have had

2653
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,800
any of this Norwegian connection.

2654
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:59,800
My life would have been totally different.

2655
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:03,800
Except for that week or so delay

2656
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,800
and getting the application in.

2657
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:09,800
So, when you're an old man like me,

2658
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,800
you can think back on these

2659
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:15,800
career changing decisions that you made.

2660
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,800
So, all in all,

2661
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,800
I would say that

2662
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,800
I just had a very happy life.

2663
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,800
And it's still happy, except I see

2664
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,800
my friends falling one by one

2665
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,800
and that's a depressing experience.

2666
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,800
But,

2667
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,800
comes to us all.

2668
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,800
Well, thanks very much

2669
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,800
if you've been to a pilot.

2670
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:43,800
Yeah, well, I've enjoyed it.

2671
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,800
Thank you.
