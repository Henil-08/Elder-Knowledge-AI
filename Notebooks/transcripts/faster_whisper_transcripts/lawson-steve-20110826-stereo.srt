1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Okay. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. So if you would just we'll start by having you state your name

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:19,679
and state and location. My name is Steve Lawson. Today is August 26th 2011 and we're in a

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,240
conference room at the Valley Library. Okay. Today we'll be talking primarily about your

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,040
interactions with one is falling and specifically trying to get a better sense of

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,520
falling sort of personal characteristics. But before we get into that, too deeply I'd like you

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,520
to talk a little bit about your life starting out with sort of a thumbnail sketch of your

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,760
biography before you into the LPI in 1977. I was born in Pennsylvania in 1951 and lived there

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
for the first few years of life. I remember collecting donations for the Little League

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,760
World Championship is typically held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. And Little League is big

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,320
activity in that area of North Central, Pennsylvania. We moved to Massachusetts along the coast north

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,040
of Boston in the mid to late 1950s. I'm not exactly sure of the date. But I went through elementary

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,120
school and high school in Totsfield, Massachusetts, which is a town in Essex County very close to

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,439
the Seacost. We lived in Ipswich originally, which is a coastal town in Essex County.

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,400
After graduation from high school, I went to Stanford University and I was there in Palo Alto

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:43,280
from 1969 to 1973. I started work at the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in 1977

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,480
and took a full-time job there in February of 1978 and had a number of different job titles there

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,320
through the years. Eventually becoming Chief Executive Officer in 1993, about a year before

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,719
the Linus Pauling died and have worked at the Institute for most of my career.

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,480
What led you to develop your interest in science or your university member in the career?

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,879
Well, that's an interesting question. I was a little rudderless, I would say, in college.

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,000
It was very difficult for me to focus on a career. Some of my friends were very career-oriented

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,599
and became physicians and lawyers, went on to business school and so forth and that's pretty typical for

23
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,960
an environment of academic excellence like Stanford University. There were a lot of high

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,560
achievers there and I myself was a high achiever of course in high school. California was a big

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,479
adventure for me coming from the relatively state and conventional East Coast and it was very

26
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,000
wild time to be in California in 1969 through 1973 both culturally and politically.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,959
There was a lot of anti-war activity and sentiments and of course the counter culture was really

28
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,120
thriving in California at that time. In high school I was very interested in science and took

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,079
advanced calculus and physics and chemistry and biology. With the idea of perhaps becoming an

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,640
architect which led me to apply to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as one of my college choices

31
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,880
because they had a very strong department of architecture. Stanford at the time had a department

32
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,680
of architecture as well and I decided ultimately to go to Stanford and after I got there within a

33
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,160
year they had completely dismantled the department of architecture so that pretty much pulled the

34
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,960
rug out from under me with respect to that initial potential career choice. I like science very

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,359
much I've always liked science very much I've always been very curious about nature and how things

36
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:51,199
work and I think with respect to a career in the Linus Poly Institute although I was relatively naive

37
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:58,639
about Linus Poly in high school and even in my early years in college I had been taking vitamin

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,960
supplements beginning in high school actually my mom gave me one a day multivitamin supplements

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,520
beginning probably when I was just a kid but then in the high school years my friends and I got

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,960
very interested in supplements and we're taking vitamin E and vitamin C and things like that so

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:28,240
the whole mission of the Linus Poly Institute really resonated with me and that led me to a position

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,519
there in 1977 that really was not science oriented at that time it was more related to analysis of

43
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,879
the direct male program which had been implemented within a few years before I joined the institute

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,280
and it provided a relatively steady income for a lot of the non-grant supported research

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,439
that was going on at the institute which of course in those days was most of the institute's research.

46
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:08,560
So between my graduation from Stanford and the time I joined the institute it was a fairly

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,439
carefree and adventurous some time I spent a year after graduation traveling around the country

48
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,519
visiting family and friends in Florida and Georgia and Maine and New England. I wanted to see

49
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,000
the country I'd been very impressed with John Steinbeck's books travels with Charlie and others

50
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:31,680
and also Jack Kerawak who grew up and is now buried in the same area in which I grew up in Massachusetts

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,000
so both of those writers had a very strong influence I think on me and my desires for

52
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,199
experience and adventure in the United States. When I returned to California

53
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,240
after traveling around for a year or so I took a series of jobs that really were not technical

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,400
in nature at all. Cost of living in those days was very low I think for $100 a month I could cover

55
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,680
my living expenses quite easily and I was not as I said career oriented at the time so I did not

56
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,000
feel compelled to go to graduate school or begin a career in earnest at that time and I didn't.

57
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,040
It wasn't until I joined the institute that I really started to focus more specifically on science

58
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,120
which at that time really thrilled me. Were there any you mentioned your interest in supplements

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,040
when you were in college and I assumed that pollen was probably something you were aware of

60
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,600
at least by the time you had graduated? Was that true and were there any other signs of your

61
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,879
role models or mentors you had during that time period that you come to mind? Well I began taking

62
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:41,280
vitamins probably in an irregular way when I was in high school probably you've seen you're in

63
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,200
high school and that continued on into my early years in college. Of course pollen had written

64
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:52,320
vitamins in the common cold in 1970 and friends in mine had open health food stores and had supplement

65
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,240
products as part of their the merchandise for sale so I was aware of this whole field early on

66
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
without really knowing specifically much about Linus pollen. As a matter of fact I knew very

67
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,960
little of Linus pollen even when I went to Stanford as a freshman it wasn't until

68
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,360
probably about 1972 that I became more aware of him and it didn't have anything to do with science.

69
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,080
At the time I don't believe he was teaching undergraduate courses in chemistry at Stanford

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,840
which would have been my possible exposure to him. I don't think he was teaching graduate level

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,920
courses at Stanford either but he was very politically active and of course this was during a lot

72
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,280
of pretty vehement anti-war protests around the country and Stanford was no exception to that

73
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,400
kind of activity and in particular there was a tenured professor of English H. Bruce Franklin who

74
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,439
was a Melville scholar one of the world's foremost authorities on Melville and has subsequently

75
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:58,240
done a lot of work in recognizing science fiction as an appropriate academic discipline for study

76
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,160
and he had joined the Revolutionary Union and also Vence Aramos which was an organization I

77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,840
believe based in Redwood City California. They were very politically active. They were kind of

78
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,240
Maoist organizations and they really wanted not only an end to the Vietnam War but I think more

79
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,000
dramatic upheaval in the federal government at that time and Stanford eventually had had

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,600
enough of H. Bruce Franklin and considered I think some of his activities borderline legal

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,039
and Franklin was getting in a lot of trouble and they decided to fire him and of course he was

82
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,000
a tenured professor so that was a big ordeal and protocol that they had to work through in order

83
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,480
to fire him. Stanford trustees at the time were quite conservative and I remember walking to class

84
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:55,279
down at the quadrangle at Stanford and I saw a protest outside the president's office

85
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,080
and there were a group of undergraduates and other people assembled around a couple of people

86
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,960
waving protest signs and the signs had something to do with the university had no right to fire

87
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,920
a tenured professor for his political activity and I saw these two fellows holding these signs and

88
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,479
they look grandfatherly to me at the time and one was Linus Pauling and the other one I believe

89
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:24,159
was Hal Holman who was chairman of the Department of Medicine at Stanford University Medical Center

90
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,079
who was a liberal and a good friend of Linus Pauling's at the time and I remember being very

91
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:36,959
impressed with the fact that these two elderly gentlemen were taking the time out from their

92
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,039
busy schedules to go and actually protesting in front of the president's office. I thought that

93
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,799
was quite remarkable because at that time most of the political activity was concentrated among

94
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,679
very young people sometimes it was very random and chaotic and encoded as well but I thought it

95
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,799
was quite remarkable that there were older people who were also interested in demonstrating for

96
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:06,159
the rights of people to express their political opinions. So that was my first that was really my first

97
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,480
awareness of Linus Pauling was from the political perspective and not really from the scientific

98
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,399
angle. It wasn't until I joined the Linus Pauling Institute that I really became much more

99
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:26,399
familiar with Linus Pauling's work in chemistry and in biology. What were your areas that you think?

100
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,159
Well when I joined when I went to Stanford as I mentioned I was very interested in architecture as

101
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,480
a potential career so I was taking engineering and architecture while that department lasted

102
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:44,639
and I also had kind of a renaissance concept of undergraduate education at the time. I thought it

103
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,839
was very important to take as many courses and different subjects as possible so I was taking

104
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,559
calculus and biology and art history and literature and poetry and just everything that I thought

105
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,040
I should be exposed to as an undergraduate. I graduated with degree in anthropology in 1973 but I

106
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,360
probably had almost enough credits in biology for a degree in biology or at least a minor in biology

107
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,440
and at the time there were a couple of pretty notorious professors at Stanford who made a big

108
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,080
impression on me. One was Colin Pittendrig in the biology department. He I believe also was director

109
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,040
of the Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey, taught a terrific course in biology and also

110
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,600
Cachadorian. William DeMent taught a very popular course in Sleeping Dreams that was very popular among

111
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:47,520
undergraduates. Phil Pzenbardo of course was teaching very popular psychology course at the time

112
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,720
and he went on to some famous the leader of the Stanford Prison Experiment which was quite

113
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,320
influential at the time. How did you come to know about the land falling institutes and the job

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,720
we were doing in five points? Well I had lived in Memel Park or Palo Alto for many years. The

115
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,840
institute was founded in 1973 on Sandhill Road opposite the Stanford linear accelerator and at that

116
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:26,000
time that part of Sandhill Road primarily the northern side of Sandhill Road headed west

117
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,960
was a series of relatively new buildings on Tom Ford property he was a trustee of Stanford

118
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,840
University and there were publishing companies and real estate companies and insurance companies.

119
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,639
Now that area is a high of venture capitalist activity but the institute in those days I believe

120
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,920
the 2700 Sandhill Road shared relatively modern office building with Kemper Insurance Company

121
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,000
and I was aware of the sign out on the street so I driven by there many times on my way to the

122
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:12,559
coastal range or to the beach and I think that if I remember correctly I saw an advertisement in the

123
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:18,639
paper specifically for a job without a lot of detailed description about the nature of the job

124
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,840
and I went to interview at the Linus Plain Institute of Science and Medicine and interviewed with

125
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,800
Art Robinson who was then the president and director of the institute and he hired me.

126
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,840
Do you recall the first time the event was falling?

127
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Well the first time I saw him of course was as I said back in about probably 1972 when he was

128
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:51,200
demonstrating against the firing of H. Bruce Franklin. I met him in 1977 because my office was

129
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,280
just off the hallway that Pauline took to get to his office which was adjacent to Art Robinson's

130
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,920
office and also the the accountant and controller were down at the end of that office as well

131
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,120
and he was very aware of who was working at the institute and what all the activities were and he

132
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,480
stopped in to introduce himself to me when I was sitting in my office one day and of course I was

133
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,440
I had remembered him from Stanford and I had become more aware of his scientific legend

134
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,560
the course by then by working at the Linus Plain Institute and I was also aware of the fact

135
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,200
that this was his institute and it was named after him so of course I had I had high regard for him

136
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,040
as being the founder of this organization that I was now working for but he impressed me as a very

137
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,840
warm charming very friendly person who was not cerebral or distant at all not a luke who was very

138
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:50,160
very welcoming. What's he frequently around the institute? I mean I know he traveled a lot but

139
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,480
we recall him being the regular presence on the early days. He did travel quite a lot but I do

140
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,680
remember him being a regular presence certainly when he was in town he would come by the institute

141
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,560
that was his office and his main base of operations and if he had to do interviews or see guests it

142
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,640
was typically at the Linus Plain Institute in his office and I remember meeting many of his friends

143
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,360
at that time including an emissary from St. George's lab at Woods Hole I believe his name was

144
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,520
I can't think of his name right now it started with a P he was very interested in

145
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,520
telling us about St. George's new theories regarding vitamin C and the electronic basis of life

146
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,799
vitamin C as an electron donor being very essential to life far above its role in preventing scurvy or

147
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:51,759
as antioxidant. Dorothy Hodgkin also came through the institute at that time and it was fairly soon

148
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,519
after I arrived at the institute that I also met you in Cameron who of course was a Scottish

149
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,159
surgeon who was collaborating intensively with Linus Pauling on vitamin C and cancer work.

150
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,439
I did I met Dorothy Hodgkin at that time I believe I was working the laboratory.

151
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I had begun a friendship with a biochemist named Alan Sheetz at the institute as well as Dick

152
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,319
Willoughby who was a biologist working on the skin cancer and vitamin C experiments that Pauling

153
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:31,199
had designed and were being carried out by Art Robinson at the time and as arts influence in the

154
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,240
institute started to wane people responsible for a lot of the biological biochemical work were

155
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,000
encouraging me to get more involved in that work. I seem to have the aptitude for it I was

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,840
quite interested in it so I moved out of the role that I was originally hired to perform at the

157
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,080
institute which was this direct male solicitation work and analysis into kind of a research assistant

158
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,520
position in the labs and that led me to come in contact with people that Pauling would bring

159
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,160
through the laboratory to to show them the work that we were doing. Bill Abarth at the time was

160
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,440
running a volcano source filled ionization mass spectrometer which was used for metabolite

161
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,000
profiling which was a big chunk of the institute's research at the time so people were always

162
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,799
interested in coming down to the first floor and seeing that rubbed gold bird contraption which

163
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,799
was always undergoing tinkering never seemed to be quite ready for routine biological experimentation

164
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,839
and since I was working the laboratory at that time I would meet people that Pauling would bring

165
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:44,799
through the laboratory and one of them with Dorothy Hodgkin. So Pauling you were hired in 1977

166
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:52,480
and LPI and have filled the career there Pauling lived until 1994 so that's a 17-year period

167
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,440
and one evening you can just generally characterize your relationship with Pauling how he evolved over

168
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:07,279
those 17 years. Sure well originally I saw little of him because my work did really not overlap

169
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,799
with his research interests I mean of course he was heavily involved in the financial status

170
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,079
in the institute and Art Robinson was the main force behind the direct male solicitation program

171
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:26,879
but Pauling was certainly aware of that and once I started working in the laboratory more

172
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:36,879
we had more to talk about and I became heavily involved in the skin cancer and hairless mice program

173
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:42,319
which was testing the effect of different levels of vitamin C in a mouse chow diet

174
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,879
on the development of skin cancer in hairless mice exposed to ultraviolet light

175
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:54,000
and other arms of those experiments and there were a number of experiments that took place over

176
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,279
a number of years some of the other arms of that project involved feeding raw food and nuts

177
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:08,399
to mice to see whether that also inhibited the development of skin cancer when the mice were exposed

178
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,320
to ultraviolet light so the mice were given things like carrots and pears and sunflower seeds

179
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,560
tomatoes and other raw food to find out what effect that would have and when Art Robinson left

180
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,200
Pauling of course was interested in finding out how this work was going and he asked me to

181
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,440
I believe the first project that he asked me specifically to get involved in was to calculate

182
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,720
the amount of certain micronutrients in the food that these mice were fed

183
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,759
because as scientists we tend to be a little reductionist we want to find out if there is an

184
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,920
effect with the whole food then what is it in the food that might be protective

185
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:00,960
so that was a very challenging project that Pauling gave to me and I was a bit frustrated because

186
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,680
the way that the food had been provided to the mice made it very difficult to determine

187
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,240
how much an individual mouse consumed of any particular food stuff the mice were also caged

188
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,240
five to a cage and there were social patterns that developed of hierarchy that developed within

189
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,720
the cage so there were dominant mice who would eat the preferred food and then the less dominant

190
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,960
mice would get what was left so there was some competition for the best food the most flavorful

191
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,680
food for the mice the way the food was provided to them was sometimes as a mush ground up or blended

192
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,000
food and sometimes as chunks of carrots and pears and so forth the sunflower seeds were given to

193
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,079
them and small glass containers with metal lids that had a hole in them and the mice would spray

194
00:20:54,079 --> 00:21:00,559
the sunflower seeds out all over the place and it was really impossible to determine the intake

195
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,319
of any of these foods for specific animal and even for a cage of animals divided by five was really

196
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,879
not appropriate calculation there was a lot of waste so a lot of the food would fall through the

197
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:21,359
mesh to the floor to the to the cage rack and sometimes they would defecate and urinate in the

198
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,080
sunflower seed container as well and then wouldn't continue to eat once they'd already defecated

199
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:36,640
or urinated in that container there were other issues as well for instance the vitamin A content

200
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,640
of carrots can differ appreciably depending upon how long the carrots are stored after they've been

201
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,440
picked and that was something that was not measured at the time so there was no analysis

202
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,960
biochemical analysis of the food that was provided to the animals and depending upon the variety

203
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,160
ripeness length of time something had been stored whether it was refrigerated or stored at room

204
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,279
temperature the micronutrient content of the foodstuffs provided to the mice could very

205
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:15,440
appreciably so I made the calculations and I sat down with Linus Pauling and told him that in my

206
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,840
estimation it was really impossible to glean any really useful detailed information about the

207
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,559
micronutrient intake of these animals and that the best we could do was say that the raw food

208
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,559
diet seemed to be protective but it was it was just too difficult to determine what constituents

209
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,480
in the raw food diet conferred that protection so it was a little bit I was a little bit ambivalent

210
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,640
about that I think I did a very thorough and and good job in making these determinations but

211
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:53,040
ultimately what I had to say was a little bit disappointing I think oh he didn't react with

212
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,680
disappointment he he reacted as you know I was presenting him with facts and calculations and he

213
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,560
was very seemed very pleased to get the information was not long after that that you and Cameron

214
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,920
began spending quite a lot more time at the institute and I believe they've taken an apartment

215
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:18,000
nearby maybe redwood city and Cameron of course was very interested in high dose vitamin C

216
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,800
as a junk to therapy and cancer as was Pauling and they had done some clinical work together

217
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,519
over the years beginning probably in 1971-1972 so it even preceded the founding

218
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:36,320
of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine and Cameron was concerned with some of the

219
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:43,519
practical issues about the administration of high dose vitamin C to cancer patients

220
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,359
who might also be taking chemotherapy drugs and we know that vitamin C has some general detox

221
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:58,319
detoxification properties and Cameron specifically was concerned that if people were taking

222
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:04,399
chemotherapy drugs then should they take high dose vitamin C at the same time which might have

223
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,640
an effect on the efficacy of the chemotherapy drugs so he didn't want to recommend to people that

224
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:18,080
they take high dose vitamin C while taking chemotherapy if the vitamin C was going to somehow adversely

225
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:26,240
affect these drugs so he wanted to find a way to study this and in association with Linus Pauling

226
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,840
and Alan Sheetz we came up with the idea of using fish toxicology experiments which is a pretty

227
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:40,319
well-established model for studying pollution in streams and lakes and bodies of water and things

228
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:48,559
like that so we read a lot about fish toxicology Alan and I figured out how to reconstitute water

229
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:57,119
from distilled water by adding back certain salts to provide the proper habitat for fingering trout

230
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,360
and the idea was that we would have fingering trout that would be exposed to vitamin C and

231
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,720
chemotherapy of drugs dissolved in their water that they were living in and we would monitor any

232
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,360
observable effects in the fish and we hypothesized that they would be detected by abnormal

233
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,560
behavior in the fish which would have to do with the way they swim the distance that they cover

234
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,440
in a certain period of time and so forth so there was some technology that was also developed to

235
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,279
make these kinds of measurements so that was another project that I worked with you and Cameron

236
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:43,359
and Linus Pauling unfortunately we had to vacate the building at 2700 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park

237
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:52,559
ostensibly because there had been cracks in the building due to small earthquakes over time it wasn't

238
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,679
a building that was set on bedrock it was on loose soil and the landlord wanted to get the tenants

239
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,919
out make some structural corrections in the building and I don't think the landlord was overly excited

240
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,319
by a laboratory in the building anyway we were sharing the building with Kemper insurance company

241
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:16,079
and I think he was more happy with having nice dry insurance company and having wet labs there

242
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:24,319
with animal experiments and physics experiments and so forth so those experiments had to be wrapped

243
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:30,319
up before we really brought them to fruition before we moved to the facility at 440 page mill road

244
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:37,119
in Palo Alto. Were there other scientific collaborations with Pauling and over the course of your

245
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:44,079
relationship? There were he would come into my office from time to time and we would talk about

246
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,799
ideas he had different projects that he was interested in occasionally he would ask me if I would

247
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,599
be interested in doing something like writing a book review which was a little surprising but

248
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,039
when Evelyn Richards book Vitamin C in Cancer Medicine or Politics was published I believe in 1991

249
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,639
or 1992 Linus Pauling came into my office with a copy of the book and asked me if I would be

250
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
interested in writing a book review to be submitted to a nutrition journal and I've of course

251
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,480
said yes and wrote the review which was subsequently published in a nutrition journal. Later

252
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,680
and of course I would go into his office from time to time and talk with him about different

253
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,680
things the quantum chemist by the name of Zele Cymon who was collaborating with Pauling and problems

254
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:38,320
in theoretical chemistry and physics over the whole period in the late 1970s through Pauling's

255
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,399
death. Zele Cymon and I were both rock hounds we had collected rocks and minerals when we were

256
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,519
kids and we knew that Pauling was was a great mineralologist and understood a lot about the

257
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,960
silicate minerals which are quite interesting so the three of us would amuse ourselves occasionally

258
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,799
by Zele Cymon and I would bring in some of our mineral specimens and we would sit in Pauling's

259
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,119
office and try to stump the expert essentially sometimes Zele Cymon and I would have forgotten the

260
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,000
identifications of some of the minerals we had so they would be presented to Dr. Pauling to see

261
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,840
if he could identify them and it was astonishing because even though he had probably not thought

262
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,240
about some of these things in many many years or even decades he infallibly was able to identify

263
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,480
the mineral and make a fairly quick identification so that was fun it didn't have anything to do with

264
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,039
any of the research going on at the institute but it was very fun to sit and talk with him in

265
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:47,599
that way. Later in the late 1980s and I'm going to say probably around 1988 Pauling came into my

266
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:55,039
office with an idea for a new technique to fabricate superconductive material and this was during kind

267
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:02,879
of a heyday of resurgence of interest in ceramic superconductors but Pauling had a vastly different idea

268
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:09,119
which had to do with the way a material could be fabricated and perhaps that would raise the

269
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,480
temperature which would be superconductive and it had to do with, excuse me, phonon dampening

270
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:23,839
and his idea was that if you could have a conductive metal like tin drawn to an incredibly

271
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,880
fine fibral as he called it maybe 10 or 20 angstroms in diameter surrounded by

272
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,480
insulating material like glass then the superconductive temperature of the tin would be increased the

273
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,560
TC of the tin would be raised and he talked with me about some ideas that he had and how to make

274
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,240
this material which he believed would be important in supporting a patent application that he wanted

275
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,640
to file and his goal I think in filing this patent application as he described it to me and

276
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:04,880
others was to generate a stable revenue source for the institute so he wasn't interested in an

277
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,440
acquiring wealth on his own but he was interested in looking for revenue sources for the institute

278
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,480
which had lurched from one financial crisis to another throughout my whole tenure at the

279
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,599
Linus Bond Institute of Science and Medicine and he thought that this might be something that

280
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:28,160
could be licensed and would generate lots of income so Zele Kerman and I set up a laboratory

281
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,079
at Stanford Industrial Park at a least facility that the institute had on Porter Drive

282
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:42,559
which also has the Sasakawa aging research facility and some storage area and we set up a laboratory

283
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:53,599
bought an oven some torches blow torches compress gas borosilicate glass tin and Zeke had developed

284
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,639
a very interesting way to collect the material that we were going to produce which was a bicycle

285
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,359
inverted on a block of wood and we had taken the rubber tire off the bike rim and we wanted to

286
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,040
collect this glass clad fibrill of tin that we would generate with torches above the furnace

287
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,760
and then connect it to the bicycle wheel and then use the pedals or a crank to turn the bicycle

288
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:28,080
rim and then we would collect in a circular fashion this long piece of glass that was filled with tin.

289
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,960
So there was a lot of trial and error involved in that and you and Kerman was aware of what we were

290
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,840
doing as well and he developed kind of a special interest in this as well so you and Kerman and

291
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,120
Zele Kerman and I spent quite a lot of time in this laboratory at Porter Drive trying to produce

292
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,680
this material and it was interesting in another way as well in that Pauline was very interested in

293
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:00,160
seeing the laboratory notebooks and wanted to be sure that we were taking copious and meticulous

294
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,279
notes on what we were doing and the laboratory notebook page for instance had to be signed and

295
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,800
dated and then periodically I believe once a week or once every two weeks someone who was not

296
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,920
associated with the project was asked to read what had been put in the laboratory notebook and

297
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,600
countersign it so typically we asked Emil Zucacamba who was the president of the institute at that time

298
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,800
to read what we'd written in the lab notebook and then he would countersign it and dated as well

299
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:33,440
which was when I was working as a scientist at the institute I think I was aware of

300
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,839
how important it is to maintain good protocol in filling out data and laboratory notebooks you

301
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:46,799
don't erase things you cross them out glue or tape things in use pen date and so forth so that in

302
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,159
the future people who are unfamiliar with your work could theoretically be able to go back and

303
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,400
repeat what you've done based only on the information provided in the lab notebook and that

304
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,920
was that concept was really driven home through this work for Linus Pauline because he was very

305
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,080
interested in us maintaining very meticulous laboratory notebook which we did he was quite happy

306
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,600
with it and after many months of trial and error and kind of a sophisticated development of this

307
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,040
technique an examination of the product through high power magnification we were able to come up

308
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,640
with material that we thought would be suitable needed to be tested of course to see whether or not

309
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,280
the superconductive temperature had changed but Pauline was just ecstatic at that time he was in

310
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:45,040
an apartment in Stanford and we Zeke and I were very excited and we brought a sample of this

311
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:53,599
down to his apartment and he himself was very excited it was it was I can imagine that he exhibited

312
00:33:53,599 --> 00:34:00,079
this kind of emotion many times throughout his life whenever he made an important scientific

313
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,440
discovery or became aware of an important discovery that influenced his own work but he just

314
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:13,840
looked joyful and he immediately went over to the mantle the fireplace and got a big cubic

315
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,320
pyrite crystal and gave one to me and gave something to Zeke and then said be sure to bring your

316
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,280
copies of General Chemistry in and unscribe them on the occasion of this happy happy discovery

317
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,400
invention that we've made and that work formed the basis for his patent application and I believe

318
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:41,039
his patent for novel technique for fabricating superconductive material was awarded in perhaps 1991

319
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:47,519
I think there were initial applications submitted as early as 1988-1989 but I think that the final

320
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:54,480
application was granted the final patent was granted in 1991. Was that technique ever employed on

321
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,360
any of them? Well it would turn out to be very difficult to measure changes in superconductivity

322
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:08,880
in this material because if you can imagine getting an appropriate contact between the end of

323
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,440
this tin fibrill that was maybe 10 to 20 angstroms in diameter was extremely difficult. We sent

324
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,880
the material off to General Electric and connected he Pauling had contacted a number of his friends

325
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,920
in industry to find out if they had equipment that might be capable of measuring making these

326
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,920
measurements for us. So there were problems in actually making the measurements but the Vice

327
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,559
President of the Institute Rick Hicks at the time felt that since we had the patent in hand

328
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:44,799
we should try to license it. So he embarked on a process of trying to identify companies in the

329
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:50,400
United States that might be interested in licensing this technology and he wasn't having much success

330
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,840
in this country he went to Japan I believe in probably about 1991 or 1992 and tried to shop it

331
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,799
around there also without I'm sure there was interest expressed but there was nothing that was

332
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:12,720
really consummated at the time and it led to kind of an interesting exchange some time later

333
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:22,720
when Rick had returned from Asia some months had gone by Emil Zucacondle called me on the intercom

334
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,960
if I would come down to his office because we had a visitor and I went down to his office and we

335
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,119
had someone there from the Central Intelligence Agency who was very interested in this particular

336
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,800
invention and wanted to know why we were shopping this around in Japan and other countries rather

337
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,320
than the United States and I explained to him that well the reason was we hadn't been able to find

338
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,840
anyone in the United States who was was interested I thought it was quite interesting that the CIA seemed

339
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:02,960
to know about this that was pretty much the end of that I think there was a miscue later

340
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,200
that had to do with the turmoil surrounding Pauling's death and

341
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,720
succession of people in charge of the institute and files being shifted around and so forth and

342
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
somehow the application to continue the maintenance fee on that particular patent fell through

343
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,280
the cracks so I think that I think the reason that it died effectively was because the maintenance

344
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:35,760
fee was not paid unfortunately or any other side of the collaborations of no point.

345
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,840
Not really I think that the vitamin C and skin cancer experiments of course I was co-author of

346
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:51,600
one of the papers that resulted from that work and in the superconductive material were the two major

347
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:58,640
collaborations. How do you describe Pauling's style of the scientists and what do you observe

348
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,680
where I think the greatest strengths of the scientists? Well he as many people have remarked had an

349
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:15,279
encyclopedic knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, perhaps medicine, mathematics, statistics

350
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:22,239
had an incredibly good grasp of statistics and that served him very well I think as a scientist

351
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:29,279
because he was as I like to say perhaps the best embodiment of the multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary

352
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,280
attack on scientific problems and of course that's a buzz word in science today and that's

353
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,440
what the NIH and funding agencies encourage is kind of team activity but it was remarkable that

354
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,519
this kind of knowledge expansive and encyclopedic knowledge was exhibited in one particular person

355
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,280
in Linus Pauling which I think was quite remarkable so his memory as well his ability to extract

356
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,320
references and facts and material from other papers and so forth that span most of his life was

357
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,920
quite remarkable so I think those two things served him incredibly well as a scientist and I saw

358
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,960
that in action many times when he could cite other literature and talk about what other people had

359
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:23,600
found and so forth so I was very impressed by his grasp of science and his memory and he also

360
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,239
struck me as being very courageous as I said earlier my first exposure to him in the political arena

361
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,679
I thought he was quite courageous at that time later I became aware of just how courageous he was

362
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:42,000
when he was facing the US Senate with respect to allegations of his lack of patriotism or something

363
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,319
like that and he basically stood them down which I thought was incredibly courageous and in another

364
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,480
sense he was a very courageous scientist when Zalik and I were working with this furnace in the late

365
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,039
1980s at Porter Drive Pauling would come up from time to time and one time in particular he put

366
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:11,039
on a lab coat and put on gloves and goggles and was wielding the torch above the 800 degree furnace

367
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,920
as well so he was actively engaged in this experimental project which I thought was quite extraordinary

368
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,119
so he didn't really prefer to just sit at his desk and think about things he also wanted to get

369
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,720
hands on when something really intrigued him or interested him and during the mouse skin cancer

370
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,440
experiments as well he would often come through the laboratory just to check on things see how things

371
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,480
were going ask people questions about the work that was underway and so forth so he was not

372
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,639
removed from the experimental side of things although clearly he was involved in a lot of other

373
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,519
things and didn't actually participate physically in a lot of the experimental work in those days he

374
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,359
he didn't he wasn't a stranger in the laboratory and I witnessed that first hand with the work

375
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,279
on superconductivity where he actually was engaged experimentally and I think that was probably

376
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:06,480
the last experimental work that he was engaged in because at that time he probably would have been

377
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,280
in his late 1980s this was the late 1980s so he was in his late 80s as well

378
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:21,280
over time you your role days to change from that of scientific researcher to more of the

379
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,840
administrator and I'm wondering if you engage in other different kinds of work with Pauling in

380
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:36,159
that context of the administrator. Very much so I had asked I had been asked to become a

381
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:41,279
assistant to the president when he meals with the president of the institute at the time I was

382
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:45,679
co-director with a meal of the laboratory for research and gene regulation and we had a small

383
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:51,839
research group we were looking at problems and cancer metastasis using protein profiling techniques

384
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,960
which had just recently been developed and we were developing instrumentation that would allow us

385
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,759
to increase reproducibility and reduce noise in the experimental procedure and we were very

386
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,440
interested in discovering genes and proteins that might correlate with the metastatic the

387
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,360
development of the metastatic phenotype in both marine and human cancer cells excuse me

388
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,320
so I was also working a bit administratively with a meal zucacondle at that time and then when

389
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,360
a meal retired from the institute on the occasion of his birthday there was quite a lot of

390
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:41,200
turmoil at the institute because there are a number of problems one problem was the institute as

391
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,000
I mentioned earlier had a history of financial instability and over the years under a meal's direction

392
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,360
the institute expanded quite significantly to include some projects that probably would not be

393
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,400
considered strictly in the realm of orthomolecular medicine of course which was Pauling's

394
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,920
most I think the reason he set up the institute to begin with and something that he felt strongest

395
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:15,280
about so I think a meal may have had a desire for the institute to become a more comprehensive

396
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,280
institute of molecular biological and chemical and biological sciences similar to the

397
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,360
Salk Institute down in southern California which is a fine template but there weren't

398
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:36,880
enough grants won by institute staff to support all the varied activities that were going on

399
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,640
so concomitant with a meal's retirement and the retirement of Rick Hicks from the institute

400
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,200
there was a shift in focus in the institute and the board of trustees decided that

401
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,000
there really weren't enough funds to sustain all the varied programs underway at the institute so

402
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,320
the idea was to pair back some of the strictly molecular biological work that wasn't funded

403
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:08,560
extramarially by government grants from DOE or NIH or NCI or whatever and refocus specifically on

404
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,960
orthomolecular medicine and at about that time Linus Pauling had begun a friendship and scientific

405
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,880
collaboration with a German cardiologist Matthias Rat who together with Pauling had developed some

406
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,720
interesting hypotheses about the relationship of lipoprotein A which is a risk factor for

407
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,440
orthosis and a major constituator at the risk of erotic plaque and vitamin C and they published

408
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:43,360
a number of hypothesis papers a very famous one being in PNAS and developed decided to set up a

409
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:50,000
laboratory for cardiovascular disease research that was directed by Dr. Rat and Pauling was very

410
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:59,120
excited about this work when and at some point and I don't remember the exact time but it was

411
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,240
after a meal had retired and Pauling became for short time the president and director of the

412
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:13,280
institute after a meal he asked me to become his assistant and I wasn't quite sure what that

413
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:21,519
meant so I had written him a note or memo asking him what he wanted me to do and I had some ideas

414
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:30,320
mainly of administrative nature as to things that I thought could result in big improvements in

415
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:37,440
the way the institute was was run and our financial status and other issues but he disappeared

416
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,280
to Big Sur to his ranch down in the coast of California for some time and I felt a little adrift

417
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,960
and by this time I had gotten to know Linus Plain Jr fairly well because he was I think in the

418
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,960
process of getting more actively involved in the administration of the institute because he

419
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,159
recognized his father was ill and there were a lot of problems at the institute and he felt he

420
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:09,359
should step in to help his father which I thought was very commendable and eventually I became

421
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:15,199
the executive officer at the institute which was similar in function to being president of the

422
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:21,199
institute and then later the board appointed me chief executive officer I think in about 1993

423
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,719
technically I became chief executive officer so throughout this period where I functioned in

424
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:34,160
different administrative roles I worked very closely with Linus Plain Jr the board of trustees

425
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,360
and of course by that time Linus Plain had become chairman of the board of trustees and

426
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,240
director of research at the institute but didn't really have an administrative role any longer

427
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,360
in the Linus Plain Institute of Science and Medicine because I think everyone felt that it would

428
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:56,559
be best if he were spared the problems that we had to resolve and there were problems concerning

429
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,840
relocation it was a zoning issue where the least property on which our building was situated at

430
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:11,120
440 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto was scheduled to change from commercial to residential zoning

431
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,640
quite quickly and no one range plans had really been developed to deal with that zoning change

432
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:23,759
and we didn't have an endowment had very little money so the prospect of moving the institute

433
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:29,119
trying to keep it intact in the mid peninsula but paying maybe ten or twenty times more in rent

434
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:37,279
was not very encouraging and Linus Plain himself of course had been diagnosed with prostate

435
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:43,359
cancer and although he was undergoing a number of different experimental therapies it was not

436
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,279
believed that he would survive his illness and we were very concerned about what would happen to

437
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,120
the institute after his death would we be able to continue to raise money to support the institute

438
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,320
as a viable research organization and then of course there were lawsuits and there was quite a

439
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,440
lot of litigation at that time Matthias Rat had left the institute and it sued the institute for

440
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,040
infringement in his business activities and also sued Linus Pauling so I had to manage a lot

441
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:18,559
of our litigation at that time as well so my role at the time the big challenges were finding a

442
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,039
future home or at least the disposition of the Linus Plain is to do the science and medicine

443
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:32,159
keeping it intact and reputable and also managing our litigation which was very burdensome

444
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:40,079
and took absorbed a lot of my time and a lot of the boards time as well but Pauling was largely

445
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,960
spared from that I mean he was deposed of course a number of times but I managed a lot of our

446
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,319
legal affairs at that time in close association with Linus Plain Jr was the chairman of the board

447
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,519
and at that time we had very regular board meetings as well so the board of trustees was kept

448
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:03,039
well apprised of all the activities and their opinions were solicited in many of these activities as

449
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:10,480
well so it was a very challenging time for me I was surprised to be honest when the board asked me

450
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,880
to become chief executive officer because it kind of came out of the blue the work that I was doing

451
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,079
with a musica condo was not really related to orthomolecular medicine wasn't related to vitamin C

452
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,199
at the time as I said we were looking at metastatic cancer which really had nothing to do with

453
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,760
orthomolecular medicine so I was concerned that my group and my job were in jeopardy as well

454
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,400
because there were rumors circulating that the board wanted to refocus on orthomolecular medicine

455
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,160
and since my work wasn't involved in orthomolecular medicine I thought perhaps I might be laid

456
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:54,400
off from the institute as well at about the same time a musica condo wanted to collect some of the

457
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,320
people who were doing molecular biological work in a new institute called the institute of molecular

458
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:08,480
medical sciences which he hoped to rent space from the Linus-Plying Institute of Science and Medicine

459
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,079
in the same building so I spent quite a lot of time as executive officer with Zele Kerman

460
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,760
analyzing that proposition trying to figure out whether it was practical and if so

461
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,400
how building expenses should be shared between the two groups and so forth so I spent quite a lot

462
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,840
of time in those kinds of deliberations at that time too and eventually we came up with the

463
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:41,840
recommendation to Linus-Plying and the board. One of Pauline's some calling cards of Caltech

464
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,480
anyway then the goal was here at the Caltech was his ability to collect and marshal and oversee

465
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:56,240
tremendous talent of scientific researches or the graduate students or postdocs and I'm

466
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,320
wondering if you adhered to some sort of dynamic going on over the course of your time at LCI

467
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:08,000
which is the ability to collect talent and make it efficient productive.

468
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,719
Well I think our Robinson is a terrific scientist and art of course was working very close

469
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,440
with Linus-Plying at the University of California San Diego and then came up to run his lab and

470
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,280
and collaborate with research at Stanford and there's no question that Dr. Robinson was an

471
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,320
extraordinarily capable scientist and with Pauline developed lots of very interesting ideas

472
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,599
so that was one person that he worked with over that period of time that I had a lot of

473
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,920
respect for and I think Pauline had a lot of respect for at least until there was a big

474
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,599
schism that developed between them which was very painful to watch especially at that time I was

475
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:53,119
not really privy to a lot of the major administrative decisions at the institute so it was a little

476
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:59,440
unclear as to why this conflict had developed but it was very difficult an uncomfortable time

477
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:09,840
for everyone I think at the institute. Excuse me. Bill Aberg, I'm Bill Aberg, a physicist was

478
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:17,840
also a very extraordinarily talented individual who was developing the mass spectrometer for

479
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:25,119
metabolite profiling. Emil Zucacondle who had developed the idea of chemical paleogenetics

480
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,639
or molecular evolution with Pauline earlier in the 1960s was an extraordinarily bright capable

481
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:38,559
scientist. He was also the founding editor of the journal of molecular evolution and was

482
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:46,400
one of those rare individuals who's capable of sustaining simultaneously many complex thoughts

483
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,319
and I saw this in action many times I have tremendous respect and admiration for Emil Zucacondle.

484
00:52:52,320 --> 00:53:00,160
He was really an extraordinary scientist and theorist so yes there were people of extraordinarily

485
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,240
high caliber that were involved with the institute and of course there were collaborations as well

486
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,400
and some of Pauline's collaborators would visit the institute from time to time.

487
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,160
There were a few problems in that since the institute did not have

488
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:28,480
stable financial resources or an endowment it was difficult to attract high caliber scientists.

489
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,519
There were high caliber scientists who were employed at the institute John Levitt,

490
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:40,000
Jim Fleming, Greg Spicer, there were a number of people that were very very good

491
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:46,880
at viewing camera and as a medical director but it was difficult because not much could be offered

492
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:55,920
to people other than at will contract which was the way that most contract most employment is

493
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,719
handled in California unless you have an employment contract and it was imprudent to offer employment

494
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:10,400
contracts to people so initially it was kind of an implied at will employment arrangement

495
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,080
with people and then later in the early 1990s it became very explicit at will employment

496
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,920
relationship with employees but nevertheless there were people who were attracted to the

497
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,280
institute because of Linus Pong because of his interest in vitamin C Dr. Connie Chow and others

498
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:33,280
who did a lot of really terrific work at willcott.com just to mention a few but there were a number of

499
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,640
really excellent people there of physicians and scientists who did a lot of very good work over the

500
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:47,360
years and in those days it was also very difficult to get expect and get funding from the

501
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,560
National Institutes of Health or the National Cancer Institute for the kind of work that Pauline

502
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,199
was especially interested in which had to do with vitamin C in cancer so I'm sure you're aware

503
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:08,079
of his difficulty in getting grants to carry out this kind of research with the very promising

504
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,639
clinical work that Cameron had been doing in Scotland Pauline and Cameron went to the NCI with

505
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,159
that work repeatedly and they suggested that he applied for funds to do animal work and soul

506
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:23,519
culture work and he applied for those funds and was turned down repeatedly over seminary

507
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:30,399
consecutive years so the money that was supported that kind of work at the institute was sought from

508
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:36,239
the public through this direct mail solicitation campaign and that was the money that was available

509
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:51,200
to pay the researchers who were doing that work. Pauline is remembering that also famously

510
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,000
being a terrific lecture and I wonder if you could comment on that your experience in seeing him

511
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:05,680
the lecture and his facility in that regard. Yes I didn't see him lecture very often I saw him

512
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,880
lectures at Stanford University and of course he would give the famous vitamin C lecture where he

513
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,280
would stand on stage and pull from his he typically wore a three-piece suit when he was giving a lecture

514
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,400
a dark suit sometimes he would wear his beret and he would invariably begin his lectures on

515
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:34,720
vitamin C by pulling out a vial a test tube and holding it up with his fingers with a very small

516
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,800
amount of a white powder at the bottom that was barely detectable from the audience perspective

517
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,840
and you would say this is this represents the RDA for vitamin C this is the amount of vitamin C

518
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:51,600
that the food nutrition board believes that people should should get every day and he would follow

519
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:58,640
that by pulling by pulling out a large test tube with 13 grams of vitamin C in it and you could

520
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,960
obviously see all this white powder and the vial from across the auditorium and he would say this

521
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,440
is the amount of vitamin C that a goat synthesizes on average every day I think goats know more about

522
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,039
nutrition than the food nutrition board and of course that always got got a big round of applause

523
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,599
and chuckles from the audience one lecture I saw him give which really stood out in my mind

524
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,839
was a lecture departmental lecture to biostatistics at Stanford and that department

525
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:37,199
was chaired by Byron Brown who was a leading biostatistician and the Stanford Department of

526
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,719
Biostatistics is world renowned they've been world renowned for many decades and Byron Brown

527
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:50,319
was the father of a classmate of mine from Stanford so I knew him and he had become aware of

528
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:58,240
Pauling's work with Abram Hauffer on a regimen provided adjunctively to cancer patients which

529
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,559
included not only vitamin C but also B vitamins vitamin E zinc and some other things and Pauling

530
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,559
and Hauffer had published two papers on this regimen and Pauling believed that it was even more effective

531
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:17,680
than the sole use of vitamin C which was given either intravenously or orally sometimes both

532
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:24,560
by Ewing Cameron and Scotland and they had and Pauling had developed a statistical analysis of

533
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:30,080
this data based on work done by an old friend of his from UC Berkeley by the name of Harden Jones

534
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:37,360
and Pauling believed that this statistical analysis was better than the standard Kaplan Meyer

535
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,400
mortality analysis because by using Harden Jones analysis you could actually resolve sub cohorts

536
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:53,920
that had similar death rates and you might be able to learn more about these sub cohorts with

537
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:01,440
with similar death rates so he thought that this was was a better way to analyze mortality data

538
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:08,240
from from clinical studies and he published also I think was Ella Kerman and perhaps it was

539
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:14,639
PNAS on this Harden Jones analysis of mortality data and he was invited by Byron Brown to give a

540
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:20,639
lecture to the biostatisticians at Stanford on this Harden Jones mortality data and of course

541
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:27,279
at the time everybody was using Kaplan Meyer which is the standard step staircase type curve that

542
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:34,400
you see published in papers and I went with Pauling and Herman to that lecture which was in a large

543
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:42,559
conference room over at Stanford and it was astonishing how little criticism he got from this

544
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:48,799
analysis I think he was prepared to be well he was never really defensive about anything because

545
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:55,599
he was very sure of his own intelligence and his own analysis but no one had any serious criticisms

546
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,279
of his analysis and people were saying that well perhaps we should we should look at this more

547
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:08,079
carefully and perhaps this does offer a better alternative to Kaplan Meyer analysis in some circumstances

548
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,279
it was quite extraordinarily quite extraordinary to see some of the world's leading biostatisticians

549
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:19,519
react that way to something that was fairly novel and and something that was certainly not

550
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:26,480
standardly employed in in this kind of analysis and it was quite interesting to see him present

551
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:33,679
present that analysis I'm wondering if you could speak a little bit more about Pauling

552
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:43,840
as a mentor as well as yourself or others as well he was very encouraging and as I said he was

553
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:51,760
not a Louvre so it was very easy person to speak with I think at the time that I got to know

554
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:59,840
him of course he was in his 80s and at that time he was considered kind of an icon in science and

555
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,559
everyone was extraordinarily respectful to Linus Pauling no one at the institute called him by his

556
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,280
first name for instance it was always Professor Pauling or Dr. Pauling even Dorothy Monroe the

557
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:18,240
secretary and assistant called him Dr. Pauling and typically Zele Curman would call him Professor Pauling

558
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:24,720
Emilio Zucacondo typically called him Dr. Pauling as did Rick Hicks and so I think that was

559
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:35,440
a measure of respect that all the people at the institute had for him he was also very

560
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:45,440
interested in in people on a personal basis as well and I remember when he had decided not to

561
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,680
drive so much himself anymore from his apartment on Stanford campus to the institute which was

562
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:58,480
just a mile or two away people would volunteer to drive him from his apartment to the institute

563
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,000
and then take him back to his apartment at the end of the day and I did that quite often because

564
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,600
I enjoyed talking with him and I also enjoyed to have an uninterrupted period with him where he was

565
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:12,800
free from telephone calls and appointments and other distractions because there were a lot of demands

566
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:19,360
on his time throughout his career I imagine and at the institute there were always people calling

567
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,519
wanting to interview him wanting him to give lectures and so forth and wanting to visit him

568
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,640
so it was rare to have an occasion to actually talk with him one-on-one with no distractions and

569
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:37,440
he would occasionally ask me about my long-term aspirations and make suggestions and he would

570
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,440
often tell me stories he loved to tell stories about things that had happened to him

571
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,920
that were based on work that we were doing at the institute or that might have been stimulated

572
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,519
by a comment I would make to him and I remember one time this is a little off topic because it

573
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,119
doesn't have anything to do with mentorship but I think it gives you some insight into

574
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:04,240
his sense of humor during one of these trips where I was taking him to the institute

575
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:10,800
he told me that he had been over at the Stanford Library to look at an old issue of nature

576
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:17,360
or science from close to the early part of the 20th century close to the turn of the century

577
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,039
and this was when David Starr Jordan was president of Stanford University,

578
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:28,480
Leland Stanford who was chairman of the board, David Starr Jordan was an ornithologist, excuse me

579
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:35,599
Iqtheologist who had written books on academic books on fish and he was president of the

580
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,400
university at that time as well as being a scholar and Pauling had been looking through an old issue

581
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:46,639
of nature and for a specific article but this other story caught his eye and it had to do with

582
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:51,599
a controversy that had developed at Stanford between David Starr Jordan and Leland Stanford

583
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:58,400
and Leland Stanford apparently had become unhappy with David Starr Jordan because during

584
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,719
trustees meetings Jordan did not refer the trustees by name and Stanford thought that this was

585
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:12,879
not civil and perhaps even borderline rude not to refer to them by name and he had implored

586
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,559
Jordan to learn the names of the trustees and in subsequent meetings to refer to them by name

587
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,280
and Jordan's retort apparently to Stanford was well I'm afraid if I enforce to memorize the name

588
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,840
of a trustee I'll forget the name of a fish and Pauling thought that was hilarious

589
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,519
and it gives you an idea of what he valued because I think he was definitely on the side of

590
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:43,440
Jordan in that argument. Do you recall any other stories from a drive time?

591
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,880
Oh there were lots of other stories one time it wasn't during a drive but it was when

592
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:56,559
I was negotiating in contract with Unilever and Elizabeth Arden who had

593
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,960
decided to develop a line of cosmetics that included some antioxidants and wanted to

594
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,079
get the institute involved in this not in a research and development capacity but they wanted to

595
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,840
support some research at the institute and provide us with a lot of money and I've been talking

596
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,199
many times with Linus Pauling about this prospect and went in to talk with him in his office

597
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:24,639
about it and he said oh he remembered one time that he and Abe Helen had gone to visit Lord

598
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:32,639
Leaver in England and had brought along a bottle of scotch whiskey as a present and it was in

599
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:40,639
their bag and they got to Lord Leaver's castle or home and they were met by servants who immediately

600
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:46,319
took their bags and they were ushered in to see Lord Leaver and Pauling and his wife were chatting

601
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:51,359
with him and Pauling remembered that he had a gift so he wanted to excuse himself and go to his

602
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:56,400
room and get the gift for Lord Leaver and he went up to his room and the servants had already

603
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:03,760
unpacked their bags put clothes in the drawers or hanging in the closet and they'd also taken out

604
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,360
the bottle of whiskey and uncapped it and had two jiggers there ready for Pauling and his wife

605
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,079
because they believed that Pauling had brought this along to serve himself so he thought it was

606
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,920
very funny that he had to present Lord Leaver were the body of bottle of whiskey that had already

607
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:28,559
been opened but he explained to him why it had been open and one other story that I thought was

608
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:35,840
quite indicative of Pauling's character was told to me by you and Cameron and Cameron of course

609
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:42,960
had been collaborating very closely with Pauling and Pauling had decided to visit Cameron at his

610
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:51,599
home in Wachlum inside on a trip that he was making to England and Cameron told me that he was

611
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,960
a little bit ambivalent about this visit by the great man of science to his humble home in Scotland

612
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,639
and he was worried that it wouldn't be presentable enough so he and his wife made elaborate preparations

613
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:10,320
to welcome Linus Pauling and his wife to their humble home in Scotland and the day that Pauling arrived

614
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:17,280
Pauling arrived and within half an hour before Pauling had arrived the toilet stopped up and

615
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,880
Cameron hadn't had time to do anything about it before the arrival of Linus Pauling and his wife

616
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:29,440
so Pauling and his wife arrived and they came in and pleasantries were exchanged and Cameron showed

617
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,440
them around the home in the view and so forth and Pauling asked to use the bathroom and Cameron

618
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,119
said which I'm very very sorry it's characteristic way but there seems to be a problem with the

619
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,519
toilet and Pauling so what's the problem and Cameron explained to him the toilet had just gotten

620
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:49,360
stopped up and he hadn't had time to do anything and Pauling said well let's go in and fix it

621
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:56,639
so Cameron was a bit of gasp but said okay so the two of them went into the bathroom and Pauling

622
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,320
cut down with a wrench and Cameron had the plumbers helper and Pauling had a wrench and he was lying

623
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:09,920
on the floor with working on the plumbing fixing Cameron's toilet so Cameron realized that he

624
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,720
didn't really need to be too careful about what he said or how Pauling was treated after that because

625
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:20,880
he recognized that Pauling was was not an aloof cerebral sort of person he didn't get his hand

626
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:33,039
sturdy so to speak so he mentioned one year maybe the first experience upon you had was of him

627
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:40,000
doing it to operate the piece of politics and I'm wondering if you could put a little bit more on

628
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,079
what you saw it and then in terms of his piece activism and the political thought of it of course

629
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:49,440
the end of the video well of course I myself was very much opposed to the Vietnam war my brother

630
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,800
was killed there as a fighter pilot in 1970 which really almost interfered with me resuming my

631
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,640
studies at Stanford because it was emotionally very difficult time and I had never understood the

632
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,360
logic of the war I didn't buy that domino theory that the administration time was promoting

633
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:13,920
with respect to we need stock communism Vietnam because then all all the countries in Southeast Asia

634
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,520
will become communist in Indonesia and Japan might be attacked and so forth I didn't buy that

635
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,720
explanation and it seemed to me that the war had been going on for a very long time and was

636
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,159
resulting in a lot of misery and I couldn't see how it was constructive I couldn't see a good

637
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:37,920
outcome so I I think had sentiments that were very similar to those espoused by Linus Pauling

638
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:45,199
at the time and Pauling of course as I learned had been an old hand in political activism originally

639
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:51,760
stimulated by his concern about proliferation of nuclear weapons and medical concerns about

640
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:57,119
the effect of widespread fallout from atomic bomb testing in the atmosphere so that that really

641
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:03,359
resonated very strongly with me there were some people at the institute who were even further left

642
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,960
and I would consider myself in some ways conservative in many ways liberal as well but there

643
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:15,039
were some people at the institute who were I would say probably extreme leftist and I remember

644
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:21,599
in particular after one of Pauling's talks at Stanford that was peace related there was quite a

645
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:28,639
lot of unhappiness among some people because Pauling had made the statement during this talk that

646
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,200
he believed that the retention of some nuclear weapons by both the Soviet Union and the

647
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:44,160
United States and the so-called mutually assured destruction principle had actually resulted

648
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:53,760
perhaps in deterrent from having a nuclear war conflagration so they were they were surprised

649
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,280
to hear him say that because I think some people had hoped that he would espouse the opinion that

650
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,520
we should destroy all weapons you know laterally and so forth but that's not what he said

651
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,440
in his lecture he said that he believed that having some of these weapons by opposing forces

652
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,079
would have probably resulted in a satisfactory stalemate because either side was

653
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:20,079
inhibited from using them knowing what would result from that first use of an atomic weapon

654
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:30,640
that was an atomic weapon he developed pretty early on in the 60s like he did in the 60s and in Paul.

655
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:36,159
Yeah and I heard him say that several times so he definitely was not

656
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,239
I would say he wasn't a pacifist because he said many times the World War II was well justified

657
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,159
and he as you know worked closely with the military to develop armaments and instruments that

658
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:57,680
helped the allied effort during World War II and he was certainly opposed to Hitler and Nazism

659
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:05,039
and I always saw him as a great patriot and it never occurred to me that great patriotism

660
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:12,000
and opposition to the Vietnam War or opposition to atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was somehow

661
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,000
couldn't be reconciled and some people they didn't seem to be the mutual exclusive characteristics.

662
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,800
Were Paul and things something that came up around this could we often do we talk about that

663
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:31,039
with people in casual conversation with his colleagues or was it primarily more business oriented?

664
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:39,279
Pauling was not someone who engaged often in small talk so even in the many discussions that I had

665
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:47,680
with him he wasn't someone who liked to talk about pop culture or movies or music or literature or

666
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,760
anything of that nature he loved to talk about science and especially about things that he was

667
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,960
interested in and he loved to tell stories and most of the stories were related to things that

668
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:10,480
interested him from a scientific basis so I don't recall ever talking with him specifically about

669
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:17,360
any political activities and unfortunately I never thought to ask him more closely about some

670
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,319
of his political activities because there were always other things to talk about and I didn't

671
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,639
really query him much about his personal history when I knew him we were always talking about

672
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:32,159
current things or things that we were going to be doing in the future and not so much retrospective

673
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:37,439
issues except when he would tell me stories based on a current stimulating conversation that we

674
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:44,239
might be having but no he didn't generally talk about political issues with staff it was mainly

675
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:51,840
related to administrative issues and scientific issues well what was he like in the larger social

676
01:13:51,840 --> 01:14:01,439
settings? Well in larger social settings he was often the the person that people gravitated to

677
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:09,119
he had a real charismatic personality kind of a magnetic personality he always had a big smile

678
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:17,119
he was very engaging very warmly greeted people in a social setting was physical shook hands

679
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:24,079
put his arm around people so he was he was very engaging and people responded to that and that's why

680
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:31,599
so many people loved him over the years and when he died in 1994 the institute collected hundreds

681
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:37,680
and hundreds of cards from people that didn't know Linus playing personally but had been deeply

682
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:43,280
affected by his death and were grieving and sharing their grief with us at the time

683
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,800
and everyone at the institute felt the same way as well I mean it was a really when he died in 1994

684
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:55,520
it was a very emotional moment for all of us because he just he had a way of generating a lot

685
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,360
of positive emotion about him and a lot of people loved him and respected him for different reasons

686
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:09,920
but he was a very jovial person he as I said he treated everyone fairly and equally I remember one

687
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:20,799
time when I was in the back parking lot of the institute Pauling was leaving the back door

688
01:15:20,799 --> 01:15:25,839
and the janitor was arriving so it was after hours it was maybe five thirty or six in the afternoon

689
01:15:25,839 --> 01:15:30,399
and the janitor was quite a way it's from the door I'd say maybe a hundred feet from the door

690
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:36,320
because janitor tended to park at the far end of the parking lot and Pauling stood there holding

691
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:42,560
the door open for probably three or four minutes while the janitor navigated this distance and came

692
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,360
into the building and then Pauling greeted him and then left the door and he was also holding a

693
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:53,200
box because he often used a box to ferry books and papers back and forth from the institute to his

694
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:58,160
apartment or ranch so he had something that in his arm as well and stood there holding the door

695
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:06,319
from the janitor and I think that was kind of symbolic in a way of the way he treated people he

696
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:17,519
was just very fair to everyone sometimes I think his excitement about scientific ideas that he

697
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:25,359
would generate in association with particular people caused him perhaps to overlook what might

698
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:32,239
some other people might consider problematic issues and personalities and I think that this

699
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:37,920
happened to him at least twice in his later years at the institute and both times it resulted in

700
01:16:38,799 --> 01:16:47,279
personal clashes very unamicable departures of personnel from the institute and litigation which

701
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:53,920
was very difficult expensive and painful for everyone involved but I think he was so excited by

702
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,960
scientific talent that he tended to overlook some personality characteristics from time to time

703
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:07,520
but as I said he was a very warm engaging person I would go to birthday celebrations which occurred

704
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:15,119
I think every five years typically at hotel in San Francisco and there were other occasions at which

705
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:23,119
visitors were honored or the humanitarian award was given out or other awards were given out or

706
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:31,920
Pauling was an attendance for an award and he was always very very charming and people were

707
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,159
very happy to see him and he always had a big smile and greeting for everyone.

708
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,319
Any specific memories about those birthday celebrations?

709
01:17:41,519 --> 01:17:47,039
Well the birthday celebrations were terrific the last one I remember was at Stanford

710
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:53,920
Court Hotel in San Francisco the mistress of ceremonies was Rita Moreno and I believe she

711
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:03,359
was approached by Rick Hicks to host that party because she had gotten an Emmy an OB atoni

712
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:09,119
and an Academy Award so Rick thought it was appropriate that someone who had been so honored

713
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:14,159
in so many of the performing fields was hosting an event for somebody who had been so honored

714
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:19,279
in so many medical and scientific and social fields like Linus Pauling and she was a real

715
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:25,119
firecracker and I think Linus Pauling really enjoyed listening to her talk and he had a lot of

716
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:32,960
his old friends there and it was it was always he always really enjoyed interacting with old colleagues

717
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:40,000
we also had a 20th anniversary celebration of the Linus Pauling Institute in 1993 at the

718
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,279
Ringsdorf House which was a Victorian House that had been renovated in the salt marsh area of

719
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:51,680
Mountain View California adjacent to Palo Alto and that was an opportunity to put on display a

720
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:58,399
lot of Pauling's awards medals honorary degrees and also invite supporters of the institute

721
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:04,159
institute staff and friends and some of Pauling's colleagues and friends who were still in the

722
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:09,039
Bay Area to come and see him and as it turned out it was probably the last time that some of these

723
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:14,319
people had an opportunity to meet him to see him again Owen Chamberlin was there a hard

724
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,640
McConnell from Stanford chemistry department had been a long friend of Pauling's and I think

725
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:25,119
instrumental in bringing Pauling to Stanford back in 1969 was there Byron Brown from Biosatistics

726
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:30,560
was there there were a number of people that Pauling had liked and associated with over the years

727
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,119
that were there and it provided him an opportunity to see them and greet them he always had a lot of

728
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:45,359
energy to meet people as well and in a very interesting way of speaking it was very characteristic and

729
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:51,680
a very characteristic way of moving as well both of which were captured quite realistically by John

730
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:58,720
Aston when he performed the part of Linus Pauling in the nature of the Marital Bond which was a play

731
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:03,360
put on in association when the Linus Pauling exhibition years ago

732
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:26,159
well he spent quite a lot of time of course with Rick Hicks and Emilzo Cacondole and I think

733
01:20:26,559 --> 01:20:33,920
Rick was Rick really went out of his way to try to take care of Linus Pauling as well especially after

734
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:41,119
Avalon died really looked after his welfare and was interested in his personal health as well and I

735
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:45,920
think even tried to get Linus Pauling to exercise which is something that Pauling refused to do

736
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:54,399
and he talked quite often with Emilzo Cacondole mainly about administrative issues so with Rick Hicks

737
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:01,760
and Emilzo Cacondole there was a lot of talk about administrative issues and these kinds of

738
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:09,280
conversations went on for a decade or longer he saw quite a lot of hardened McConnell who was someone

739
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:16,160
he could talk about chemistry with and Henry Talby as well at Stanford and Zellik Herman was

740
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:22,160
another person that was a colleague and an employee of the institute but someone that Pauling could talk

741
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:28,880
in a very meaningful detailed way in depth about theoretical chemistry and structural chemistry

742
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:36,639
and physics so Herman and Pauling co-authored quite a few papers during this period in the 1970s to

743
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:44,319
the 1980s and up to the 1990s and I think Pauling relied on him to do a lot of the sort of the

744
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,599
heavy work in many of those papers so we spent a lot of time with Zellik Herman as well

745
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:57,279
and there were a lot of people that visited him who he'd known throughout his life

746
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:06,399
but he didn't really seem to have what I would call a strong social life of course

747
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:12,960
if he was entertaining people at his home in Porto Avali or at his apartment in Stanford I wouldn't

748
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,960
necessarily have known about that I mean I went to his home in Porto Avali a number of times he

749
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:25,279
and his wife used to host Christmas parties there and one of the last Christmas parties I went

750
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:35,920
to there I think was probably 1979 Avali and died in 1980 or 1981 81 so I believe that this was

751
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:42,640
probably about 1979 and I remember thinking about the egg nod that Pauling made which was really

752
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:51,920
extraordinarily good he wasn't a chef but having a Nobel prize winning chemist Nobel prize winning

753
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:58,480
chemist make the egg nod and spike it with with Avali it was pretty extraordinary it was a really

754
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:06,480
terrific treat and he when he was with his wife was also very affectionate and I think people picked

755
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:14,720
up on that affection and responded to that as well after his wife died of course there was no one

756
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:20,880
for him to be that affectionate with so he was a bit different in in social situations because

757
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,280
he didn't really have someone to to be affectionate with in those circumstances

758
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:38,319
She was a really diminutive person she was short she was very well spoken very articulate

759
01:23:39,759 --> 01:23:45,679
and I enjoyed speaking with her when I talked to her several times she and I did not talk about

760
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:52,639
science so much as we talked about other issues and she as I found out later was particularly

761
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:59,520
fond of their association with some of the celebrities in in Los Angeles and Hollywood during the

762
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:06,240
era in which Pauling was trying to educate them about radioactive isotopes and nuclear weapons

763
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:13,760
and so forth and engaged in peace activities as well and we talked I think Avali and I talked

764
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:19,200
about those things sometimes but typically she was very close to her husband physically whenever

765
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:23,840
they were in a social environment and he always liked to steer the conversation to science so

766
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:30,079
the conversation typically would would end up being about science and not so much about some

767
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:40,479
of the other activities one of the thing about Pauling that I enjoyed was when I found out that he

768
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:48,559
enjoyed reading mystery novels I also was a big fan of Sherlock Holmes and not so much Agatha

769
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,680
Christie but particularly Rexed out and I asked him if he had read all of Sherlock Holmes and

770
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,039
Rexed out and of course he had so there wasn't anything I could loan him but there were other books

771
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:04,480
that I was reading he was not familiar with one was called The Red Right Hand by Joel Townsley Rodgers

772
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:12,000
which I think was written in 1939 or 1940 and it's a real hard boiled great detective story

773
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,280
and I loaned that to him and he really he loved that book very much and he consequently

774
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,079
loaned me books I would loan him books and he would he would loan me mystery books as well that

775
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:29,039
that he'd finished reading it was very interesting in and one time he he broke from that orthodoxy

776
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:34,479
and loaning me mystery novels and loaned me a book called Good Night Ava by Richard Bissell

777
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:42,000
and this was a 1950s pulp paperback with a painted cover and he said I think you'll enjoy this

778
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,719
and I got the book and I read it and it reminded me a little bit of Verscan Caldwell

779
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:55,600
even Mark Twain maybe and the cover of the book showed kind of a the sultry group

780
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:02,400
sitting on a on a porch of a kind of a ram shackle cabin probably in the banks of the Mississippi

781
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,360
River and there were a couple of guys lounging around looked like near-do wells and there was a

782
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:15,280
woman's trimming a guitar in not much on and she had her foot up on a pickle barrel or something

783
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:21,600
and I thought it was amusing that he'd loaned me this book and it was actually an amusing

784
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:26,560
entertaining read as well and I gave it back to him and when he when I gave it back to him his

785
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,600
eyes kind of sparkled a bit and he said did you notice anything particularly funny about the book

786
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:38,000
and I said yes and both of us burst out laughing he had taken a photograph of his wife

787
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:45,600
and cut out her face and pasted it over the face of the woman playing guitar and the

788
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:52,160
cover of the book and I thought that was very funny very appropriate since the the book had Ava

789
01:26:52,160 --> 01:27:00,880
in the title as well you have that book I'm sure you do yeah and he had he had a terrific sense of

790
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:07,440
humor Zella Kerman likes to tell the story of the time that he was standing at the urinal

791
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:13,039
in the men's room at the Linus Pine Institute Science Medicine and Linus Pine came in and stood

792
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,319
next to him and looked over and said ah we meet his peers

793
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,399
so he was not prudish and of course Ken Hedberg has a very famous story of

794
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,079
when Ken was a graduate student at Caltech and was looking through one of those little plastic

795
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:41,519
viewfinders of the woman O'Natural in a stream standing on a rock or a boulder he was holding

796
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,720
this viewfinder up to the light and he heard Pauline's footsteps outside his office and thought oh

797
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,280
and Pauline came in and of course wanted to see what the viewfinder picture was and he held the

798
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:59,920
viewfinder up to the light and said ah the salt he'd identified the rock that she was standing on so

799
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,760
he had a great sense of humor and it was definitely was not prudish

800
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:11,280
um just backtracking briefly you mentioned me that Helen is talking about the connections that

801
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:17,199
they have with some of the Hollywood types do you call any individual which is particularly

802
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:22,239
fun about the women and stuff that no I don't but I remember there were a number of people who

803
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:26,800
came to the institute and also to some of Pauline's birthday events and other events

804
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:35,760
uh such as Eddie Albert I remember giving a tour to Eddie Albert and his son Eddie Albert Jr one

805
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:47,279
time at the institute and Carl Sagan came by one time for an event and there were a number of

806
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,199
other number of other people who escaped me right now who came through the institute and one

807
01:28:51,199 --> 01:29:01,119
reason or another but those were I believe after a valentine died so those were people who had

808
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:06,800
continued to have some tidaline as Pauline or the one as Pauline's institute but I don't recollect

809
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:12,960
talking with her about specific people. Pauline by all accounts had a very difficult time feeling

810
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,480
and wondering if you have memories of that time period and how that fit in itself?

811
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:26,800
Well as Eric all he was gone quite a lot after her death uh I think he took a trip to Oregon

812
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:34,079
and visited some of his old boyhood haunts his home uh maybe the semi-family cemetery maybe

813
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:42,720
went to condon came here to Oregon State University he was perhaps didn't exhibit the same sort of

814
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:47,680
levity that that I was accustomed to seeing in him and in other words he was spontaneously happy

815
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:55,360
in the late 1970s when I saw him he always seemed to be very happy and uh very carefree

816
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:02,560
I think there was a more somber demeanor um that he exhibited after her death

817
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:10,960
and a lot of the sort of levity seemed to evaporate from his countenance at that time.

818
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,000
Now that's slowly returned over the course of the 1980s and I'd say by the

819
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:23,520
mid to late 1980s he seemed to be pretty much his old self in terms of a good sense of humor but

820
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,560
there was a period there when he didn't seem to be very happy.

821
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,039
Yeah that's fine.
