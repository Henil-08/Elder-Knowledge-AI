1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,799
that are replaceable okay we're done so we will have you check the volume level

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:19,839
level and we're okay good my name is Stephen Lawson it's September 19th

3
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,440
2011 and we are in a room in the Valley Library on the campus of Oregon State

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,200
University so this is the second of our interviews that is basically doing when

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,400
it's falling in his personal characteristics and there's a lot of different things

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I'll ask when I want to start to say by talking about the Pauline family and the

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,560
interaction that you have with Pauline's children. Peter Pauline I believe I met

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,359
Peter probably in the late 1970s or early 1980s for the first time when he

9
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:04,079
was visiting his father or his parents in California from England. Very

10
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,800
interesting fellow he was in a way the black sheep of the family in terms of his

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,120
personal habits he seemed to drink quite a lot and was a smoker so I think

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,719
that that some of those habits had some health consequences for him late in

13
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,159
life but he was a very personable very direct person with a good sense of

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:34,079
humor I really enjoyed my interactions with him. In the early 1990s I received a

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,120
box addressed to me at the Linus Pauline Institute of Science and Medicine in

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:45,159
Palo Alto California with no return address and no letter inside but the box

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,799
held what appeared to be Linus Pauline's chemistry Nobel Prize medal and I was

18
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,719
very perplexed by this I didn't know why it would be sent to me who sent it

19
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,920
except that the postmark was Europe from Europe so I knew that it originated in

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,159
Europe but I had no understanding of who sent it or why and whether or not the

21
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,359
medal was authentic I called up Henry Talbe who's a Nobel Prize winner in

22
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,479
chemistry at Stanford who was a good friend of Linus Pauline's and you know I

23
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,399
compared the medals and the the medal that I had got in the mail seemed to be

24
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:21,120
authentic except for the fact that it seemed to be an alloy rather than solid gold

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,439
or gold plated whatever the actual medal is I put it aside in my office and

26
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,759
about a week and a half or two weeks later I received the second package from

27
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,579
Europe again no return address no correspondence this time there was the

28
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,740
Nobel Peace Prize medal inside the box so now I was really stumped and very

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,500
curious as to why these were being sent to me and who had sent them and about a

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,939
week or two after that second box had arrived I received a phone call from

31
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,860
Peter who was in England at the time and he asked me early on in the

32
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,380
conversation if I'd received anything unusual in the mail recently and I

33
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,500
said well yes Peter I have I received two replicas of your father's Nobel

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,340
prizes and he said oh good I'm glad you got those he very graciously had gone

35
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,219
to the academies and had duplicate medals struck in an alloy for family members

36
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,860
and for the Linus Pauline Institute of Science and Medicine which I thought was

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:28,379
very nice of him and I think he had that done well it was around the time of

38
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,379
his father's death I don't recall if it was before or after but it was right

39
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:43,180
around that era when he did that I never really had a chance to talk to Peter

40
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,180
about a scientific work or his work in on chemical structure we did talk

41
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,620
occasionally about the vitamin C in cancer work that Pauline was doing in

42
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,780
collaboration with you and Cameron and Scott one and Peter was very

43
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,060
interested in that work of course although I don't know that he actually

44
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,420
communicated much with you and Cameron even though they wasn't the same island

45
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,060
there off Europe

46
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,459
Linda Pauline I've known for quite a long time I think I met her either a party

47
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,340
at her parents house in Portola Valley or perhaps at the Linus Pauline Institute

48
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,540
of Science and Medicine in Memo Park she's a very nice person like I said

49
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,260
I've known her for a very long time and I knew her husband I think perhaps

50
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,140
before I met her because her husband would visit the Linus Pauline Institute

51
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,220
in Palo Alto occasionally to talk with his father in law Linus Pauline because

52
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,420
they had jointly authored papers in theoretical physics and chemistry and

53
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,180
Barkley was a very interesting person and I remember asking him to explain one of

54
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,139
the papers to me that he co-authored with Linus Pauline and he said he was

55
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,819
stumped by it which is a very amusing I got to know Linda a little bit better

56
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,939
when the Linus Pauline exhibition was being planned because we both served on

57
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:15,340
the advisory committee so we were meeting together with family members and other

58
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,220
people from the scientific community and Soka Gakai quite often to both plan

59
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,019
the Linus Pauline exhibition and at the different venues at which you can

60
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:31,379
be so I did get to know her her pretty well and I remember when we moved

61
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,379
files from the Linus Pauline Institute of Science and Medicine here to Oregon

62
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,259
State University many of the files from Pauline's office were moved to

63
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,459
Winnegaard Hall before they were transferred to special collections and I was

64
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,819
looking through some of those files for one reason or another and I came

65
00:05:49,819 --> 00:06:01,779
across a letter from Richard Feynman Nobel Prize winner at Caltech to Linus

66
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,860
Pauline apparently in response to a letter that Pauline had sent to him earlier

67
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,740
because the earlier letter was referenced in the response from Feynman to

68
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,420
Pauline and Feynman at that time had been diagnosed with an often fatal disease

69
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,420
and I think Linus Pauline had written to him suggesting that high dose

70
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,180
vitamin C may have some value and apparently in the earlier letter that Pauline

71
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,540
sent to Feynman he had enclosed some reprints of papers that he and Cameron had

72
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,540
written on vitamin C in cancer explaining host resistance and stimulation of

73
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,180
immune system and so forth so Feynman had written back to Pauline thanking him

74
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,379
for providing all this information to him and mentioning that he was going to

75
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:49,180
share this with his physician and then I think in a separate paragraph he he

76
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,899
started an impair phrasing that he was been thinking about Pauline's long

77
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,659
career very productive career and all the major contributions that he had made

78
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:03,860
to science and humanity and he closed by saying something quite clever and

79
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
funny he said no Linus I've been thinking about all your achievements and

80
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,779
the wonderful things you've done for society but I think your greatest

81
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
achievement your greatest contribution has been your daughter Linda I thought

82
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:27,780
that was quite funny

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:40,900
not really I think when I was engaged with Carolyn Linda or Peter particularly we

84
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,340
were either in social settings in which there were a lot of people involved so

85
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,660
it wasn't easy to have a protracted conversation or they were meetings in

86
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,020
which we had specific strategic goals and we talked about various businesses or

87
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:04,180
relationships or so forth but I never asked any questions about family history of

88
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,260
any of the children actually even though I had many opportunities it just never

89
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,539
occurred to me to delve into their personal relationships with their parents

90
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:18,939
maybe I felt it was a little improper for me to do so

91
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:25,420
Carolyn I had known Carolyn for quite a long time he came by the Institute as did

92
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,899
all the children from time to time so I would see them although I didn't

93
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:37,860
communicate much with him Carolyn became more active with the Institute as his

94
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,500
father's illness progressed and as we were struggling with future options for

95
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,379
the Institute and he was also the executor I believe of his father's will and

96
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,919
some of the elements of that will affected the Linus Pond Institute of

97
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,100
Science and Medicine so one thing that I discussed with Carolyn in great

98
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,340
detail and we communicated about many times both Orlean and writing concern

99
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,019
royalties to some of Linus Pond's books because Pauling had written for

100
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,860
instance how to live longer and feel better as an employee of the Linus Pond

101
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,300
Institute of Science and Medicine and he had directed that out all royalties and

102
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,740
revenue from that book be given to the Linus Pond Institute and when it came

103
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,740
time to tie up some loose ends concerning the Linus Pond Institute of Science

104
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,419
and Medicine I was interested in whether that same principle would apply to

105
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:38,700
some of Pauling's other books in particular vitamin C in the common cold or

106
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,620
vitamin C in cancer which of course again was written as an employee of the

107
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,980
Linus Pond Institute of Science and Medicine so Carolyn I discussed those issues

108
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,220
several times and he seemed to be very amenable to reason which I thought was

109
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:01,220
great.

110
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,340
Linus Pond Jr. I enjoy Linus Pond Jr very much and of all the children I've worked

111
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,580
most closely with him and I think I probably know him best of of all the

112
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,180
children. I had seen him from time to time when he came to California to

113
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,300
participate in trustees meetings because I believe he's been on the board of

114
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,460
trustees of the Linus Pond Institute of Science and Medicine excuse me

115
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,300
probably since its inception and periodic board meetings were held over the

116
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,420
years and I would see him but I never really met him until the Institute was

117
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:40,340
reorganized in the early 1990s and there was a desire I think on the part of the

118
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,540
board and on the part of Linus Pond Jr. to spare his father from some of the

119
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,819
administrative responsibilities and tasks associated with running the

120
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,779
Institute on a day-to-day basis and let him concentrate on research which

121
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,659
really is what he wanted to do and since time was becoming more precious

122
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,459
everyone felt that that's what he should do what he wanted to do which was to

123
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:10,139
focus on science. So I talked to Linus Pond Jr. after I was asked by the board to

124
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,980
become executive officer and then later chief executive officer of the Linus

125
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,180
Pond Institute of Science and Medicine and Linus Jr. became chairman of the

126
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,460
board of trustees he and I worked very closely together for several years and

127
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,659
communicated very often about financial, personnel, management issues at the

128
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:37,620
Institute. In particular there was the possibility that the former president

129
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,980
director of the Institute, Emil Zuckerkondel, would start a new institute called

130
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,180
the Institute of Medical Molecular Sciences and that we would subtly space in

131
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,420
the building at 440 Page Mill Road to IMMS and that was a very complicated and

132
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,420
somewhat controversial and divisive issue and Linus Pond Jr. and Linus Pond had

133
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,259
asked me along with a couple of the people at the Linus Pond Institute of

134
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,180
Science and Medicine to analyze this possibility and report as to whether or

135
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,380
not it would work practically and if so how we would manage that that sublease

136
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,280
and sharing of the physical space in the building. So I worked very closely with

137
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,500
Linus Pond Jr. during that period and then of course in trying to stabilize the

138
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,260
finances in the Institute which were always teetering in those days and worked with

139
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,220
him closely on public relations and kind of marketing in the Institute and

140
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,379
later very closely on trying to identify options for the future of the

141
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:46,300
Institute because with Linus Pond's demise and the problems that confronted us

142
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,340
in Palo Alto it was not certain that the Linus Pond could carry on as a viable

143
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:58,580
research organization or even if that was the ideal option for the future so we

144
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:05,700
spent many hours and days analyzing and debating what the right future for

145
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,820
the Institute might be and eventually decided that keeping the orthomolecular

146
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:18,940
medical mission as a lasting legacy to Linus Pond's work in orthomolecular

147
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,580
medicine which is why the Institute was founded in the first place would be the

148
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,420
most appropriate future for the Institute so Linus Pond Jr. and I set about

149
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,300
trying to identify as I said options for relocation.

150
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,420
You mentioned Barclay Camber when they had their other people with other

151
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,620
extended family or any other college out there that you had contact with. Yes.

152
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,260
Barclay Cam's son, Barclay Cam Jr. I believe, I call him Barkey, is a partner at

153
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:57,500
Cooley Godworth in Palo Alto and his wife was asked to become a trustee of

154
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,019
the Linus Pond Institute of Science and Medicine back after the reorganization in

155
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:09,740
the early 1990s and we had quite a few onerous legal issues to deal with at

156
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,059
the time and Barclay being part of that law firm that we hired to provide

157
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:20,779
legal counsel and advice was very helpful to the Institute and I talked with him

158
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:27,439
many times at that time and of course I saw him socially as well. I don't

159
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:32,319
believe that I had much interaction with the other extended members of the

160
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:37,539
family. At about the time of Pauling's death before he died and after he died

161
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:41,579
there were of course many visits from extended families, Linus Pond Jr.'s

162
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:48,120
family, Linda's family and others and I met many of the grandchildren and

163
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,120
so forth but I can't say that I really had very meaningful conversations with

164
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
any of them. You brought something up that I hadn't thought to ask about but it

165
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,360
makes perfect sense to you and I guess you had a pretty

166
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,600
perspective on the transfer of Pond's favorites from the App Museum a lot of work at the

167
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,399
OB offices. Yes, it was very interesting. I've always been in favor of

168
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,159
transparency and access and I thought that I've always thought that access to

169
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,919
Pauling's papers and memorabilia should be encouraged for scholarship because

170
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,480
there's a lot to learn there and I think the more people look into Pauling's

171
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,559
career and activities the more interesting and astonishing it becomes. It's

172
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,600
really a multifaceted project although it didn't have some concerns initially

173
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,679
about when I learned that the intent of special collections which I think is a

174
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,960
good one was to make Pauling's papers available online. It struck me as a

175
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,900
really terrific project especially the scientific papers, the research and

176
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,800
outputs and so forth but I was concerned about the correspondence being scanned

177
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:05,080
and made available online for a couple of reasons. One, many people would write

178
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,840
to Pauling with asking for advice on medical issues. They had cancer, they

179
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,360
had various disease, they had a friend or relative or a colleague with disease

180
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,800
and they wanted to know how much vitamin C to take or what other therapies might

181
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,519
be appropriate to treat this particular disease and sometimes they would

182
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,960
include a donation and typically the way these donations were processed the

183
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,700
photocopy of the check might be made and then stapled some of the

184
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,980
correspondence. So I was concerned that there needed to be some judicious

185
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,340
oversight in the way material was scanned and made available online because

186
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,940
medical conditions, confidential medical and financial information related to

187
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,900
some of Pauling's correspondence I didn't feel should be released to the

188
00:16:53,899 --> 00:17:05,299
public. So I was a little hesitant in making that material available to

189
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,259
Oregon State University until special collections had come up with some sort of

190
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:15,099
strategy to screen that material to protect those confidential issues of

191
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,859
people that had written to Pauling over the years and never suspected that

192
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,500
their letters or information would be publicly available on the internet.

193
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,299
Partly because the internet hadn't existed when they wrote and and for other

194
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:34,940
reasons. Many of Pauling's files, his manuscripts, a lot of the scientific work

195
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,539
his correspondence were maintained by Dorothy and Monroe at the line as Pauling

196
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:43,180
Institute of Science and Medicine. So of course those files were under our

197
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,180
control for many years and then I worked with you and with Cliff Mead as well

198
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,980
who was Director of Special Collections at that time to ensure that that this

199
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,779
material got transferred to special collections. Although in many cases everything

200
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:07,180
was moved in one project by a moving company from the 440 page mill road

201
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,080
address in Palo Alto to the campus of Oregon State University and to

202
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,220
simplify things almost everything in that move went to our area and went at her

203
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,620
hall and was stored in various rooms and then from time to time those files and

204
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,180
file and cabinets and materials were then transferred to special collections.

205
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,339
I do have some memories of that the the green board that was in his office he

206
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:45,299
seldom erased from it. Sometimes he inadvertently erased things because he

207
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,500
would move too closely or a guest in the office would move too closely to the

208
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,339
board and their their code or shirt would inadvertently erase some of the

209
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:59,940
writing on the board. I once asked Dorothy Monroe maybe out of vanity why my name

210
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,500
wasn't on the board because I noticed that the names of some of the

211
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,740
institute employees were on the board and I was curious as to why my name wasn't

212
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,379
and he said well that's because he knows you so well he doesn't need to have your

213
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,660
name on the board as a monomic device because sometimes for people that he

214
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,580
didn't interact with regularly to associate the name on the board with the

215
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,540
person when they came into his office was very useful to him and the entrance to

216
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,100
his office was adjacent to that green board so it could very easily look from the

217
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,460
person to the board and back and and attach the name to the to the person that

218
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,020
was standing in front of him if he was unclear as to who that person might be I

219
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:45,180
think Cliff need the former director of special collections manage the

220
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,859
technical aspects of moving the chalk board I know that there were issues about

221
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:56,819
electrostatic disilligment of the chalk particles from the board if different

222
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,139
types of acrylic were used and there was discussion about spraying the board

223
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:09,139
with some sort of sealant that would forever fix the the chalk to the board but

224
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,420
whatever technique was used I believe a box was built around the board and

225
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,860
moved very carefully they didn't have standing job because as far as I can tell

226
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,320
there was no loss of information and when the board was moved from

227
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,820
Pong's office to special collections something else getting away from

228
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:29,139
calling a little bit here but something else the reference that I asked about is

229
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:42,299
the traveling exhibit to New York with Linda on the SGI exhibit yeah well I think

230
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:50,500
that the origin for that exhibit probably goes back to I know Diasaka Akeda

231
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,779
the head of SGI and Linus Pong had met in conversed prior to the to the

232
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:03,420
establishment of the Linus Pong exhibition so they were acquaintances and I think

233
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,019
SGI or Akeda had expressed a desire to do something for Linus Pong or the

234
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,420
Linus Pong Institute of Science and Medicine and I think although I'm not

235
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,740
exactly clear on this my recollection I hadn't thought about this in a while

236
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,420
and I haven't consulted any files but I think that the I think that desire was

237
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,340
transformed into the exhibition partly due to conversations perhaps with

238
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:35,620
Linus Pong junior in the early 1990s and then of course we thought it would be

239
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,460
a way of educating the public about this extraordinary man and introducing

240
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,539
school children to Linus Pong as a role model perhaps because Linus Pong

241
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:51,140
worked in chemistry and chemistry is not that sexy as subject to many

242
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,740
citizens in the United States cosmology theoretical physics things like that

243
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,440
things that Einstein was involved in or Carl Sagan was involved and seemed to

244
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,820
resonate with people but chemistry is a little bit difficult a little bit

245
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,480
oblique to many people so we thought that having an exhibition devoted to

246
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,020
Linus Pong and all facets of his career as a humanitarian as an activist as

247
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,940
a scientist as a medical researcher would be a way of honoring Linus Pong his

248
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,460
legacy and also introducing his incredible work to school children and

249
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,539
people around the world it was hugely successful millions of people saw it

250
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:37,180
in locations in Europe and Japan and many locations in the United States was

251
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:43,740
terrifically well executed and designed very very diligent and creative

252
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,340
design people working with Soka Gakai transform the exhibit or design the

253
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:54,299
exhibit to fit into the available spaces in DC and San Francisco and Boston and

254
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,339
everyone who who saw the exhibit really thought it was very very impressive

255
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:05,339
and actually Soka Gakai when the exhibit had finished touring gave all the

256
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:18,179
elements of the Linus Pong exhibition to Oregon State University I did I

257
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:25,220
went down to dear flat ranch they had a little guesthouse that was built I think

258
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,100
at the south end of the beach adjacent to the main house and I went down fairly

259
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,700
late in Pauling's life I think it must have been around 1993 perhaps even

260
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:43,259
1994 when I went there and my visit was associated with a deposition that our

261
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,640
attorneys were doing of Linus Pong related to litigation with health now in

262
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,120
T.S. Rat and I remember driving down and taking him the Sunday paper because I

263
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,280
know that he always liked to read the Sunday San Francisco Chronicle on the

264
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,259
funny so I took him that large paper and visited him at dear flat ranch and got

265
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,480
to see the house and wandered around the beach and it was very very enjoyable it

266
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,600
was a little sad too because it was difficult to see him somewhat incapacitated

267
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,280
but it was really a terrific experience to be there so I'm trying to get a

268
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:24,400
sense of the space here is a very important place to find and it was easy to see

269
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,400
why it was so important to him because it was very remote and secluded there

270
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,440
were no distractions a terrific natural environment in a house perched on a

271
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,580
bluff overlooking the ocean very tranquil space and I think it's easy to see

272
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,019
how we got a lot done there without any internet connection or fax might

273
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:50,119
believe it might have installed a fax machine later on but I was an ideal

274
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,839
place for him to work and think without distractions because when he was in

275
00:24:53,839 --> 00:25:00,079
Palo Alto he was a very famous man and his time was sought by many people for many

276
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:06,559
different reasons old friends colleagues the public media and I think it was

277
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,679
difficult for him to concentrate at his office at the line is playing us to

278
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,639
science and medicine at least on page mill road because there were so many

279
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:20,000
demands on his time when he retreated to dear flat ranch he removed himself

280
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
from that contact that connection so he was I think he really loved that time

281
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,399
alone down there I believe the property is still owned by the family but I'm

282
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,600
not exactly sure what they intend to do with it

283
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:52,880
well I know that he'd like to watch some some programs on TV some serialized

284
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,519
programs he read quite a lot he'd love to read mystery books and I think we

285
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,960
may have talked about that in earlier conversation I would loan him mystery

286
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,799
books and he would loan me books and actually a lot of his books before he died

287
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,480
ended up at a bookstore in California Avenue in Palo Alto because he would stop

288
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,799
in that bookstore and trade books it was a bookstore where you could trade or sell

289
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,680
your use books for books that they had in stock so I remember looking through

290
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,799
the bookstore and finding Linus Pong's name and many of the books in the mystery

291
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,440
and science fiction area that he had brought in to trade for other books

292
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:37,600
he was interested in reading he didn't seem to have much interest in cinema in

293
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:48,720
plays in show business arts fine art music I didn't seem to be anything that came

294
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,039
up very often in conversation so he did not really seek out those kinds of

295
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,600
experiences I think he was happiest just doing his own work thinking about

296
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,880
scientific problems the few times that I had cocktails with him in his apartment

297
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,760
at Stanford he was happy to sit and talk about a wide range of things and he

298
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,600
liked to drink vodka and we would typically have vodka and tonic sometimes he

299
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,360
would just drink straight up vodka or maybe with water and talk about a wide

300
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:33,040
range of subjects but popular culture the arts were really not I don't think of

301
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,720
great interest in him so he was a rare individual in that there was really no

302
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,080
division between in my mind what he did recreationally and what he did

303
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,040
professionally I mean he was a scientist through and through and derived

304
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:53,399
pleasure from working on scientific problems and that pleasure I don't think

305
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:59,039
was to be substituted for pleasure in other activities I'm sure that he did a

306
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,720
lot of things on his own or with his wife traveling and so forth and visiting

307
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,159
different places with his wife that were enjoyable to him but when I knew

308
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,200
him best late in life after his wife had died it didn't seem that that he was

309
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,840
that engaged in activities other than than science

310
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:36,019
okay okay oh he was very industrious very industrious he worked all the

311
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:40,000
time as a matter of fact I remember going to parties at his house in Portola

312
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
Valley and using the restroom the bathroom and oftentimes if you go into

313
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,160
someone's bathroom you'll find a prevention magazine a reader's

314
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,799
digest or entertainment weekly or time or the newspaper or something and

315
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,039
Pauling's bathroom was stack of journals scientific journals

316
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,720
well I think it goes without saying that he was extraordinarily creative and had

317
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,759
an interesting way of visualizing and thinking about scientific problems and

318
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,079
issues so I think in terms of creativity I can't think that at least in the

319
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,680
scientific realm that he's surpassed by by anyone really when you think about

320
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,539
the nature of his stunning contributions to molecular medicine molecular biology

321
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:35,000
chemical bond I don't think it gets much more creative than that is memory was

322
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,039
prodigious it's rare that you encounter someone who has such a clear memory of

323
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:49,240
so many details and Pauling was very frequently able to recite the

324
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,319
co-authors of papers that have been published not just his own papers but

325
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,720
other papers that have been published 30 40 years earlier the date and the

326
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,839
journal and basically could give you an abstract of that particular

327
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,600
paper so he had an incredible memory and I think that is one of the reasons he

328
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:14,040
was able to make so much progress in science he was able to conjure facts from

329
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,760
deep in his memory about perhaps unrelated topics and fit them together in a

330
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,000
real synergistic way and and make new discoveries but I have felt my father

331
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,560
also had a stunning memory I won't say it was photographic but it was close to

332
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,119
being photographed he was able late in life to remember things that he had

333
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,720
learned as an undergraduate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology that I

334
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,879
found very surprising I would try to stump him with calculus problems when he

335
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:48,919
was a businessman and he was not stop not stumpable and Pauling was very

336
00:30:48,919 --> 00:31:00,440
similar perhaps even better than my father in the on the memory score well I

337
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,680
think Linus playing at a healthy ego I think he was well aware of his

338
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,160
abilities some people I think misinterpret that confidence in his own

339
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,880
abilities as arrogance and I never really interpreted that way it seemed to me

340
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,360
that he knew what he was talking about he was able to justify his opinion or

341
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:28,000
his statements about various issues which he was talking and I think he had a

342
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:47,480
very healthy ego I'm not sure that I ever saw him angry I saw him when he was

343
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:55,000
less than happy but I'm not sure that that would qualify as angry I've seen him

344
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
concerned and maybe sad but not really angry although I'm sure for instance

345
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,200
during the Mayo Clinic in Brolio in the late 1970s and mid 1980s he had every

346
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,559
right to be very angry and perhaps he expressed his anger to some of the

347
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:25,359
participants in that controversy but I never saw him angry he tended to move

348
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,919
somewhat slowly sometimes that was because he was carrying a heavy box with

349
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:38,000
him with correspondence and books and papers so he never really seemed to be

350
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,519
fatigued he wasn't physically vigorous at the time I knew him at the

351
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,559
Linus playing a suicide medicine but he certainly didn't seem fatigued but he

352
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:56,359
was not a physically dynamic person how did he handle disappointment I know there

353
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,240
were a lot of great applications between them one day and this time he was in the

354
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:09,319
front of the advocacy and yeah I think he was disappointed clearly and all the

355
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:14,160
emotions that go along would be disappointed but he never felt dejected

356
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,960
because I think he felt that that he knew better than many of the people who

357
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,160
were denying him the grant funds and knew what was required to participate in the

358
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,160
grant funding game and was playing it and he was disappointed that he wasn't

359
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,920
rewarded by playing the game appropriately and the way he'd been told to play

360
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:40,920
it by the funding agencies so he was somewhat chagrin that he couldn't get

361
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,440
the money from federal agencies to do the kind of research that he felt was

362
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,759
very important I didn't see him angry at particular people but he was

363
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,600
unhappy that he couldn't get financial support to do work that he felt would

364
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,160
be very important in public health for instance the vitamin C in cancer work

365
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,080
is a case in point when Cameron had started treating terminal cancer patients

366
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,000
hospitalized waiting to die with high dose intravenous and oral vitamin C and

367
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,639
reported to Pauline that some of these people were having very dramatic

368
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,720
responses Pauline and Cameron collected a lot of the data pathology,

369
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,039
histology, x-rays, so forth and Pauline felt that that data was probably

370
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,920
persuasive enough to get the National Cancer Institute to set up a

371
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,719
randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial to test the

372
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,559
efficacy of vitamin C in cancer learn more about it and the reception he got

373
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,400
by the NCI was very negative and they always found a reason that maybe vitamin

374
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,920
C wasn't responsible for this response maybe it was coincident with

375
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,159
something else and Pauline said well that's exactly why I want these

376
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,879
clinical trials to be carried out to find out whether this has value and

377
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,839
it totally we have evidence that has value now we need to find out whether whether

378
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,920
it does truly have value and NCI had sort of an odd perspective on the problem

379
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,119
they wanted Pauline to apply for funds to study this in cell cultures and

380
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,239
animals animal models like mice or rats so Cameron already had some clinical

381
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,320
evidence but they wanted to turn the wheelbarrow upside down and start with

382
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,200
cell cultures and animals so typically the trajectory the normal scientific

383
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,280
trajectory would be to establish biological plausibility and see effects in

384
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,240
cell culture models and then move on into animal models to find out if you can

385
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,160
replicate the in vitro results in an in vivo model and then if that's all

386
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,400
promising then you move eventually into a clinical translation of this

387
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,840
of this modality and Pauline and Cameron were actually starting at the end of

388
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,599
that tripartate paradigm and he wasn't anxious to go back and start with

389
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,680
cell cultures and animals so it was I think excuse me a bit frustrating to him

390
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,200
and to one to you and Cameron that they were being forced to to start at the

391
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,119
beginning when they already had results in people that seemed to be very

392
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,880
promising and they believe would be sufficient to set up a randomized clinical

393
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:30,639
trial to test this in people. Were you at all privy to or involved or

394
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:39,819
observed to Robert Perrydowke's collaboration with Pauline? Well Robert

395
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:43,559
Perrydowke of course visited the institute many times because he was

396
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,239
Pauline's official biographer so he came to talk with Pauline, talk with

397
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,000
Dorothy Monroe, talk with people, call it Pauline's colleagues at the

398
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,920
institute and elsewhere many many times over the years and I got to know him

399
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,400
reasonably well. I never had much input there. I believe I may have spoken to

400
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:10,159
him in the 1990s about some of the litigation and Robinson and Rath issues.

401
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,420
I really don't know the status of the biography. I have no idea. I wish

402
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,519
a grin to learn at one point that he had no book contract and it seems to me

403
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:27,599
that if you have a book contract and that implies a deadline and you've got

404
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,880
to you've got to have a product by a certain date that the publisher is

405
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,159
interested in producing and I was surprised to find that apparently Robert

406
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,000
Perrydowke never had a book contract and was doing this presumably in hopes of

407
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,559
shopping and around to different publishers at some later date but I think a

408
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,900
book contract would have really been a terrific catalyst to getting that project

409
00:37:51,900 --> 00:38:00,159
completed. Tom Hager I talked with him and I like his book very much actually. I

410
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,599
think it's probably the best biography of Linus Pauline and Tom of course had

411
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,920
some access to Pauline late in his career and visited the institute several

412
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:16,240
times and I was interested in I thought that the the last chapter in the end of

413
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,480
the book to coincide with the end of Pauline's life was perhaps a little bit

414
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,000
abrupt and it was interested in working with Tom to develop that a little bit

415
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,079
more thoroughly especially with respect to the Rath litigation but I think the

416
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,880
publisher was interested in getting the book on the shelves. Excuse me not

417
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,440
long after Linus Pauline's death in August of 1994 and I think the book

418
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,579
appeared in the fall of 1994 so I think that they were interested in wrapping it

419
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:50,720
up and getting it out there to sell while Pauline was still in recent

420
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,119
memory in the news because that would have been a good marketing opportunity for

421
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,440
them and I have since talked with Tom although I don't know if he has any desire

422
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,720
to do this or as publisher as any desire to do this in perhaps a new

423
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,280
edition of this book which would wrap up some of the loose ends that that

424
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:19,640
were left angling in the original book. No I didn't know that. Not very interesting.

425
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:29,440
No I never had any contact as far as I can remember with Seraphini or the

426
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,960
Gertzels. I read their books. I thought they were interesting. I mean I think

427
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,159
no book is perfect and all have some failures or defects and I think those

428
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:54,200
two books have their share of failures and defects but well I think

429
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,720
Pauline as a result of his campaign to end atmospheric testing on nuclear

430
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,120
weapons and his political activities in the 1950s learn pretty well how to

431
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:14,160
use the media and I was struck by his facility with the media. I mean he gave

432
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,720
hundreds or thousands of interviews to journalists and media representatives

433
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:26,160
throughout his life and he knew what the audience was and he knew what part of

434
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,320
the story to give to the particular interviewer for that particular audience

435
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,880
and he was extremely good at describing pretty complex scientific phenomena in

436
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,840
ways that perhaps the average intelligent person can understand and grasp

437
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,280
them. So he was a terrific speaker and was able to distill pretty complicated

438
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:55,280
ideas down to easily digestible communications.

439
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:16,240
Yeah that's interesting. Well of course during the male clinic in

440
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,220
Brolio there was quite a lot of communication between the public and the

441
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:26,320
institute and Linus Pauling because at that time although Cameron Pauling pointed

442
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,520
out that Craig and Mortel who organized and carried out that male clinic

443
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,520
those male clinic studies two of which were published had not really read Cameron

444
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,120
or Pauling's papers and were not prepared to reproduce Cameron's work

445
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,800
technically. So they never gave any vitamin C intravenous land there were other

446
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,760
problems with male clinic studies that have been dealt with at length by

447
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:57,200
other people. So when people heard that the famous male clinic had

448
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,440
apparently objectively evaluated high dose vitamin C in cancer and came up

449
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,680
with negative findings there was kind of a flood of questions about this

450
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,760
and Pauling and Cameron had prepared criticisms of the male clinic studies and

451
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:19,360
those were provided to people who were interested. I think that the only I can't

452
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,880
remember exactly big windfalls financial windfalls to the institute from the

453
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,280
direct male program as a result of public statements by Linus Pauling or

454
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,040
other people at the Linus Plains Institute of Science and Medicine but I do

455
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,760
remember that there were negative consequences from both the male clinic

456
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,920
studies and somewhat later when people discovered that the institute was doing

457
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,600
work on HIV not AIDS but HIV infection cell culture work and the effect of

458
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,480
vitamin C in inhibiting replication of the virus responsible for AIDS there were

459
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,680
people that had moral problems with that work for whatever reason and some

460
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:08,679
donations dropped off as a result of that.

461
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:15,519
What do you hear a sense of Pauling's attitude towards the money especially in this

462
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:25,000
middle of life? Well, you can assume that he was a pretty wealthy guy by the later use of his money.

463
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,599
Yeah I don't think money was an issue for him at least during the time I knew him on the latter

464
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,759
or third of his life. I feel fairly confident in saying that he didn't have any

465
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:42,360
personal money problems. He loaned money to the institute many times, directed

466
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,839
royalties from books to come to the institute so if he had needed money

467
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,319
personally I don't think he would have done that for instance. So to me he seemed

468
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,199
like a very generous person financially he was he was giving money to the

469
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,319
institute he was trying to find money for the institute to carry out research that

470
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,840
he felt was important. So he seemed to be very generous and altruistic. He never

471
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,240
seemed to be interested in doing anything that would raise money for him for

472
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,840
instance the patents that he was involved in acquiring weight in life, one in

473
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,120
superconductivity and then patents related to lipo protein A and vitamin C. I

474
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,440
think the goal there was not to enrich himself but to find more revenue streams

475
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,800
for the institute so that it could do research that he felt was important. So I

476
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,639
would say that's very philanthropic attitude, very altruistic.

477
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:54,440
Did you have a travel inform? Let's see. No I guess I didn't. I traveled with him

478
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,720
to city hall in Palo Alto from his apartment and I would often chauffeur him

479
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,039
from his apartment at Stanford campus to the Linus Poly Institute and take him

480
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:08,400
home in the evening mainly because although his driver's license was still

481
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,740
valid he had decided not to drive so much anymore and it gave me an

482
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,800
opportunity to talk with him about scientific issues and administrative issues

483
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,820
and he could regale me with stories from his past in kind of a distraction free

484
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,860
environment namely in the car while I was driving so but that's the extent of

485
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:35,620
my travel with him, local travel. Well in the early 90s he developed the illness

486
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:41,420
it would eventually take a while to try to treat that with an experimental treatment.

487
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:50,180
Well when he went public with a diagnosis of prostate cancer of course many

488
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:54,539
people were shocked especially as critics they weren't shocked I think they

489
00:45:54,539 --> 00:46:01,299
were well I don't want to be too critical of them but many people said we've

490
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:04,819
been advocating vitamin C for all these years and taking vitamin C for all

491
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:08,299
these years and now you've got cancer how do you explain that and probably had a

492
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:15,019
very rational non-defensive response which was most elderly men develop

493
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:21,340
hyperplastic or hyperplasia in their prostate most elderly men at autopsy are

494
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:27,500
found to have cancerous cells in their prostate and it's just not uncommon it

495
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,500
happens to many many elderly men and he said it's quite likely although not

496
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,940
provable and I'm paraphrasing that his high intake of vitamin C delayed the

497
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,699
inevitable by 20 years and more because he died at the age of 93 and a half and

498
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,860
of course many men start to develop prostate problems 20 years earlier than

499
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,260
that so it's not a provable assertion but I think it's just as reasonable as

500
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:57,300
any other assertion about the relationship of vitamin C to his cancer he

501
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,580
treated himself both with high dose vitamin C although I believe he did not

502
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,820
take intravenous vitamin C perhaps just oral vitamin C which is a little

503
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,660
surprising but on the other hand the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C

504
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:16,839
had not been really clearly worked out and this was before the vitamin C

505
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:22,099
transporters had been discovered so no one really knew exactly how vitamin C

506
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,579
got from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream and to cells and

507
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:29,619
tissues it's clear that not all of it got into the bloodstream from a large

508
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:35,139
ingested dose some was excreted some that got absorbed was excreted and some

509
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:40,219
just passed through the intestinal tract so the pharmacokinetics were not

510
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,940
well understood and it wasn't until after pouring died that that people started

511
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,820
to to look into that more carefully and we now know for instance that there are

512
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,980
active transport molecules on cells in the intestine that limit the amount of

513
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,900
vitamin C that gets taken up by cells and move from the intestine into the blood

514
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,620
stream so when you take large oral doses you cannot get the same blood

515
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,780
concentration of vitamin C that you can get when you get it intravenously

516
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,900
because then you bypass these transporters on cells and get the vitamin C

517
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:15,220
directly into the bloodstream and some work actually a lot of work

518
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,180
suggests that one of the major anti-cancer mechanisms of high dose vitamin C is

519
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:25,660
the generation of hydrogen peroxide as a result of either auto-oxidation of

520
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:31,320
vitamin C or reactions of vitamin C with metals and this seems to be selective

521
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,500
to tumor cells and hydrogen peroxide diffuses into the tumor cells and

522
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,780
disrupts their cellular machinery by different mechanisms that wasn't

523
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,019
really well known when Pauline was self-medicating with vitamin C for his

524
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:49,860
prostate cancer so he didn't prefer intravenous vitamin C at that point because

525
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,780
it wasn't any perhaps clear rationale for it. I know that he had surgery he

526
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,740
underwent a bilateral orkiectomy and also was taken flutamide which is a

527
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:05,260
standard chemotherapy drug for prostate cancer and I know that he was also

528
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,580
working with friends and colleagues at Stanford Medical School to raise

529
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:14,980
monoclonal antibodies against his prostate cancer cells and I don't really

530
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,340
know how those things work sequentially or whether he was combining some of

531
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,539
those modalities I'm not clear about that but I know that all those avenues were

532
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:31,099
were tried by him and he was actually quite public about his treatment and

533
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:44,420
about his illness. I believe the last time I saw him was when he was

534
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:50,360
deposed by our lawyers in 1994 I think it was early summer late spring or

535
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,720
summer of 1994 at his home in Deer Flat Ranch.

536
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:10,840
Well it's tough to have clear memories such an emotional event.

537
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,480
Linus Pauline was an unusual public figure in that many people who didn't even

538
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,160
know him felt very strongly about him either positively or in some cases

539
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:25,119
negatively perhaps and people who knew him really tended to love him because

540
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,519
he was such a charming magnanimous and wonderful person to be around and when

541
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,480
he died I think everybody that knew him was grief-stricken myself included and it

542
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,440
was very difficult I was asked to speak at that funeral as was the president of

543
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,639
Stanford University Gehrhard Kasper and a number of other people and it was very

544
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:52,239
difficult to maintain composure and talk about Linus Pauline at that event.

545
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:58,559
What was the fallout of the death sentence? Well the immediate fallout was

546
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:06,039
probably a rise in memorial contributions in honor of Linus Pauline. We were of

547
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,960
course very concerned about the long-term success of the Linus Pauline

548
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,039
Institute because many people who had contributed money believed rightly so in

549
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,579
many cases that Linus Pauline was at the helm of the ship and he was directing

550
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:22,880
the research and he was director of research at the end of his life and we were

551
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,199
concerned that absent Linus Pauline people might start to lose interest in

552
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:32,400
the Linus Pauline Institute and stop supporting it financially and we had no

553
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,639
endowment at the time and we had some zoning problems with the building in

554
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:41,880
Palo Alto we weren't in a least building on a commercially-zoned site

555
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:48,800
440 page mail road which was scheduled to change to residential zoning so we

556
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,680
knew we had to move and absent Linus Pauline no endowment and moving was quite

557
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,599
a challenge for the Institute and I alluded to this earlier the Board of

558
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,160
Trustees Linus Pauline Jr. myself really grappled for a long time with these

559
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,119
these issues thinking about different opportunities and options for

560
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:15,519
relocation and ultimately decided to come to an academic institution because

561
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:22,239
academic institutions except for a few tend to be permanent and we started to

562
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:26,599
look at academic institutions that were doing work that was compatible with

563
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,900
Linus Pauline Institute of Science and Medicine's mission where this work in

564
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:37,260
orthomolecular medicine would find a good home and be able to be carried out as a

565
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:43,579
working tribute to Linus Pauline's ideas in orthomolecular medicine.

566
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:50,260
Very lucky for us during those deliberations we were the happy recipients of a

567
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,940
number of large bequest and those bequest allowed us to establish at least a

568
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,260
small endowment I shouldn't say endowment but to have enough money to fund an

569
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,620
endowment for the director's chair here at the Linus Pauline Institute at

570
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:08,020
Oregon State University which at that time was matched by the state so it was

571
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:13,380
a functional $3 million endowment which allowed us to attract very high

572
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,720
caliber director and subsequently with the help of the research office at

573
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,860
Oregon State University we were able to attract high caliber faculty as well

574
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:29,220
so well that's the end of my set of questions on point I guess I'll just ask you

575
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,059
if there's anything else about falling to personality or personal characteristics

576
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:38,220
or the relationship that you share that you're interested in anything that is needed.

577
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,740
Well I think I've said before I found them to be very funny he was he was very

578
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:51,180
charming very witty of course seemed to know everyone know everything he was just

579
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,220
a joy to be around and maybe I mentioned in our last interview that when

580
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,100
Zella Kerman and I had finally succeeded in producing some material in a

581
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:05,200
superconductivity project that we all thought would exhibit a higher super

582
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,540
conductive temperature to see the expression of delight on Pauline's face when

583
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,360
we showed him the material that we produce was extremely memorable I have

584
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,880
vivid memories of that because he was just as gleeful as a teenager on a

585
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,440
first date to show him that material and he just had a real joy for scientific

586
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,680
discovery and I think that was the the thing that most motivated him in life.
