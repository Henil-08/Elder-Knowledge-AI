1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,679
All right, Steve Lawson, we're here in a room at the Valley Library.

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,839
It's the 14th day of November 2011.

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,120
Okay, so today we will principally be talking about the Institute at OSE, but there's a couple

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:26,519
of things I wanted to touch on sort of the past chronology of our talks that we didn't

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,519
actually get to.

6
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,620
And the first is an important question.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,619
I think that's that you can just sort of trace how you advance into the ranks of executive

8
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,060
officer to make sure that you've got the officer in the role of that.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,019
Sure, that was quite a surprise.

10
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,519
I think in our last conversation, I'd outlined some of the financial problems that the

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:52,519
Institute had been chronically experiencing and these go way back to the 1970s, where staff

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,240
was asked to take pay cuts and the contribution to the retirement plan was decreased periodically

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,200
for a set period of time.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,500
So employees in the Institute were no strangers to financial hardship.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,159
Salaries were not very competitive, fairly low, probably when compared salaries to roughly

16
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,000
equivalent positions in academia or in the private sector in that time.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
But I think people had a great passion for the Linus Point Institute, which is why I worked

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,299
there, certainly, because I really felt strongly about the mission and I really liked Linus

19
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:27,299
Pauling.

20
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,519
The more I found out about him, the more I liked him, and I was very pleased and kind

21
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,799
of honored to be part of the Linus Point Institute of Science and Medicine.

22
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,320
And as my skills developed in science, and I started to get involved in more and more

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,079
projects, I found it very challenging and lots of fun.

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,840
And I think I demonstrated some aptitude, or I don't think I would have been asked

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,359
by Pauling and others to participate at the level I was asked.

26
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,359
Then in the mid-1980s, Emil Zucco-Condo, who succeeded Art Robinson as President Director

27
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:11,120
of the Institute, was getting very interested in using a relatively new technique called

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:19,039
two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to profile proteins that might distinguish tumor

29
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,280
cells from primary tissue, from metastatic tumor tissue.

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,400
And we set up a laboratory together and started on a fairly productive collaboration.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,040
And as a result of that, I became co-director of the lab for research and gene regulation,

32
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,560
and reported directly to Emil Zucco-Condo.

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,359
And Emil and I got along very, very well.

34
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:47,199
I really respected him, an extraordinarily intelligent person.

35
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:54,799
I can see why his collaboration with Pauling was so successful in the early 1960s.

36
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:03,439
And as the institute moved to the point of inflection of the decades, Emil's tenure was

37
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,439
coming to an end.

38
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,560
And as I mentioned last time, Emil and Rick Hicks departed from the institute because I think

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,960
Emil was unwilling to make some of the changes that the board felt were necessary to align

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
income with outgoing.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,800
So the institute had expanded pretty dramatically under Emil's direction and had become kind

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,960
of a broad molecular biological biomedical research organization.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,120
So it had some areas of orthomolecular medicine, but it also had areas that were really not

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,879
germane to orthomolecular medicine that were of interest to Emil, specifically, and to

45
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,200
others, of course, who were carrying out the specific research project at the institute.

46
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,520
So when Emil left, and Linus Pauling, of course, had become sick and was not interested in

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:00,080
carrying out many administrative responsibilities, Linus Pauling, Jr. stepped in to fill an

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
obvious void there.

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,640
And that began kind of my long association with Linus Pauling, Jr.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,680
I got to know him very well, and I think we worked together very well as well.

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,600
I took care of the day-to-day management of the institute and Linus Pauling, Jr. as a

52
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,480
result of his experience and wisdom, provided some direction to me as well.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,320
I think I mentioned last time that when the institute was going through this reorganization

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,600
a fate of different research projects and researchers within the organization was really

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,600
up in the air and people weren't sure whether they would be asked to remain with the

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,480
institute or whether they would be laid off.

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:52,980
So researchers whose work was pretty carefully aligned, excuse me, with the newly refocused

58
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,840
orthomolecular medical mission felt fairly confident about remaining with the institute

59
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,360
and others were really anxious, of course.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,560
At some point there was a board meeting, and there were board meetings more often during

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
this period.

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Board meetings had been relatively rare during my tenure at the institute.

63
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
I was never sure exactly when a board meeting was being held.

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,560
I think that they were held probably as often as required by law, but not very often.

65
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,800
But during this period of change in turmoil board meetings were quite regular, and of course

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,319
I was unsure about my fate within the institute as well, because the work I was doing was really

67
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,839
not related specifically to orthomolecular medicine, so I was concerned that I might

68
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,360
be losing my job.

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,800
And I was aware of a meal's imminent departure, so I obviously was concerned about my future

70
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,279
then too.

71
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,279
And it came as a great surprise during a board meeting when I was summoned to the To Linus

72
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,600
Planck's office where the board was meeting by Dorothy Monroe, and I had no idea why they

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,920
wanted to talk to me or what I could offer to the board, but nevertheless I went down

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:19,240
it, met with the board, and at that time they introduced some changes that they had

75
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,160
been thinking about, and they asked me for my opinion of these changes.

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,680
And on the board and the office there, somebody had written out kind of an organizational

77
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,800
chart for the institute.

78
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:40,960
And I looked at it and made a few comments and generally thought that I opined and I thought

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
it was a good opinion.

80
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:49,600
I mean it was a good idea that they had decided to really make clear the responsibilities

81
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,879
within the institute, because it was something that was of great concern to people, because

82
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,639
the institute had operated, managed early as a bit of a black box, and decisions were

83
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,120
not always clear, and the rationale for decisions were not always obvious.

84
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,360
And I think that's true in any organization, but in a small organization it can be, it can

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,120
cause a lot of problems.

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:18,240
So during the board meeting they asked me also, I believe, if I was interested in participating

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,560
in the reorganized institute, and without giving it much thought at the time, I said yes.

88
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,339
I was a bit surprised and also I think a bit flattered by this invitation to assume

89
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,480
more responsibility within the institute, and I thought it was likely to be quite a challenge.

90
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,040
At that time I had no idea just how dramatic a challenge it would be, but I knew that it

91
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,319
would be stimulating, and like I said earlier, I liked to solve problems, and I saw quite

92
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,639
a few problems, and I thought that I might be helpful in tackling them.

93
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,800
So your panel changed at some point, Bill, from the executive office of the chief executive

94
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
office?

95
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Right.

96
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
It went through metamorphosis.

97
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,959
Initially Linus Pauling had asked me to be, I think the title was Assistant to the

98
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:19,399
President, when he assumed very temporarily the role of President, and I took that job

99
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,399
seriously.

100
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,399
I didn't really know what it entailed, but I took it seriously.

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,840
And I started thinking about things that needed to be acted upon at the institute, and I

102
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,960
think I produced a list of some things that needed to be done, and my rationale for

103
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,800
doing them, and gave that to Linus Pauling, and he left for a few months to go down to

104
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,120
Big Sur.

105
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,480
So there was really a bit of a vacuum, and I think Linus Pauling Jr. recognized that

106
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,879
his father at that time, recognized that his father really had no interest in managing

107
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,639
the institute, and I was left without much direction at that point.

108
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,980
I'd been given a new title, but I didn't really have a firm grasp of what I was expected

109
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,159
to do, and I didn't really feel that I had the authority to do what I thought was in

110
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,720
the best interest in the institute, because I was not the chief administrator of the institute.

111
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,460
So my job title changed when the board reorganized the institute and asked me to become

112
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:25,620
involved in management from that to executive officer.

113
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,100
And I think executive officer has come an old terminology from the military, and maybe

114
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,300
after a year or so as executive officer, I was named chief executive officer.

115
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,259
Was there any significant difference in the power you had, or your response to the

116
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,379
goal, is there a title change?

117
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,019
I think it was just a title change.

118
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:52,179
I think it was just recognizing the actual duties that I was performing at the institute.

119
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,819
Because Linus Pauling Jr. of course was still living in Hawaii, and he would come to

120
00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:01,740
the institute periodically, sometimes as often as once a month for a day or two, excuse

121
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,539
me, but I was handling all the day-to-day administrative tasks at the institute, and also we had

122
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:14,659
litigation at that time and trying to, we were trying to chart a course for the future,

123
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:20,539
and all those things I was acting on on a daily basis and thinking about and discussing

124
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:26,059
with my colleagues at the institute and elsewhere.

125
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:32,059
I believe he became chairman of the board of trustees, and Linus Pauling Sr. at some

126
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:37,459
point became director of research, which was a little odd because technically Linus Pauling

127
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,620
on the board, the board was responsible.

128
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,100
I reported to the board, so I reported to Linus Pauling, but as director of research he

129
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,379
also technically reported to me as chief executive officer, so it was kind of an odd situation

130
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,940
but it didn't interfere with our relationship or any of our activities because I don't think

131
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,019
we let titles get in the way.

132
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:07,019
Another thing that we touched on in our last meeting that I wanted to follow up on the real

133
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,019
question here was the Linus Pauling Foundation, so I mentioned that in the context of something

134
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,019
that the TS rat was involved, and I wondered what became of that.

135
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,019
Right.

136
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:25,019
As I mentioned, some of the TS rat's activities were unknown to employees of the institute.

137
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,620
We became vaguely aware at some point that other organizations, with kind of a parallel

138
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,659
mission to the institute, were being set up by Pauling and Raff, and that caused a little

139
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:40,779
consternation because we weren't sure if, and I wasn't in management at that time, but

140
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:47,019
we, the employees at the institute weren't sure if these other organizations were going

141
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:52,299
to be competitive with the institute, were they going to compete for funds for the same

142
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,460
donors, for instance, or the same organizations?

143
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,260
And at some point, it became clear to me that it really wasn't strictly competitive but

144
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,700
I didn't really see the rationale for having independent organizations to carry out this

145
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
work.

146
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,140
So I believe that Raff and Pauling set up the Linus Pauling Heart Foundation because they

147
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:18,620
were anxious to sort of get around the management of the institute and raise money and carry

148
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,500
out clinical trials in vitamin C and heart disease, specifically atherosclerosis, and do

149
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:32,080
more investigative work, maybe mechanistic work on lysine, proline, vitamin C and lipoprotein

150
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,360
A, which was the main focus of Pauling's research interests at that time in North and

151
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,860
Milwaukee, the medicine.

152
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,940
But Raff had, as he and Pauling were starting to grow apart because Pauling, I think, was

153
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:56,980
expressing some decrease in confidence in Raff's behavior and abilities.

154
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,740
Pauling decided to wrap up the Linus Pauling Heart Foundation and I believe this was probably

155
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,740
after Raff had left the institute but here was this organization that had an independent

156
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,900
life, had headquarters in a small office building in California, and just a few blocks from

157
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,419
the institute and Raff had apparently hired several people to do work there.

158
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:23,860
So they were on the payroll and some of the activities of the foundation apparently

159
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,699
were surprised Pauling because when he was informed about these things he was not pleased

160
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,419
about some of the activities the foundation was under taken.

161
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:40,620
So he asked me if I would wind up the Linus Pauling Heart Foundation and transfer the assets

162
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,060
to the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine to carry out work and heart disease.

163
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,820
So I told him I'd be happy to do that and set about legally dissolving the Linus Pauling

164
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:59,019
Heart Foundation and taking the physical assets back to the 440 page mill road facility

165
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,419
and also transferring the financial assets to a restricted account at the Linus Pauling

166
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,259
Institute of Science and Medicine.

167
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:14,100
Okay, so the last, at the end of our interview last time we were at the point where Pauling

168
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,259
Shide, which is 1994, he received a couple of pieces of substantial gifts that had kept

169
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,019
the institute more or less alive but you also know you need to leave it off because of

170
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,019
the return to it.

171
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,500
And in 1996 the institute moved to OSU so I'm interested in knowing how that process

172
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
carried out.

173
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,019
Let me back up briefly in 1994, it was a very pivotal year in many respects not just

174
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,860
because of Pauling's death but it was also the year that we celebrated the 20th anniversary

175
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,220
of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine.

176
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,340
And we started early, let's see, I think it must have been late spring or early summer.

177
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Maybe it was late spring.

178
00:14:53,340 --> 00:15:00,139
Let me see now, I'm confused about the year, was it 1993 or 1994?

179
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,659
Also it was 1993 when we celebrated the 20th anniversary, that would have been the

180
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:08,580
appropriate year at Rangstorf House in Mountain View, California.

181
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,259
And that was an opportunity for Pauling to see some of his old friends and colleagues.

182
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:19,259
We invited quite a few of his colleagues from academic institutions and local donors and

183
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,259
friends of the institute.

184
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,500
And of course the staff, faculty and staff of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine

185
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
and their guests.

186
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,019
It was a really terrific event at a beautiful renovated Victorian house that was on the

187
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,299
mud flats in Mountain View and special collections came representatives of special collections

188
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,299
here at OSU.

189
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:42,820
Came down with some of Pauling's medals and awards that he'd already given to the university.

190
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,700
So they were on display and we had posters, scientific posters and it was really a great time

191
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,179
for Pauling to meet and greet perhaps for the last time some of his associates.

192
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,740
And then in 1994, also to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Linus Pauling Institute

193
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,100
of Science and Medicine, we decided to convene a large scientific conference.

194
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,340
In the institute had historically convened a number of conferences.

195
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,660
One was to honor Bjorn Nordinstrom from the Carolinsky Institute.

196
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:23,580
Pauling became quite interested in his bioelectric theory of cancer therapy, which is quite interesting.

197
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,780
So there was a symposium to honor him and then some years earlier there had been another

198
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,420
symposium called Nutrition Health and Peace convened by the institute with presentations

199
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:41,379
by a whole raft of people doing work in orthomolecular medicine, molecular biology and chemistry.

200
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,620
Again, a little bit to honor Linus Pauling's work in orthomolecular medicine science and

201
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
peace.

202
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,680
And of course there had been birthday parties for Linus Pauling and the Linus Pauling and

203
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
the work for humanitarianism.

204
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,960
So there had been a lot of events throughout the history of the Linus Pauling Institute,

205
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,880
some were the fundraising focus and some of the scientific focus.

206
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,759
But of course, Linus Pauling was always at the midst of these occasions.

207
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:13,519
So we decided that an appropriate 20th anniversary event would be a conference, a scientific conference,

208
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,080
organized around the theme of orthomolecular medicine.

209
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,960
Linus Pauling was pleased to hear about this and we decided to call it the therapeutic

210
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,679
potential of biological antioxidants.

211
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,039
And we had a scientific committee and organizing committee set up at the institute that reviewed

212
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,119
poster abstracts and invited people to speak at the conference.

213
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,960
I remember going into Pauling's office to ask him what he thought of our provisional title

214
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,039
of the therapeutic potential of biological antioxidants and in his very characteristic

215
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,440
way, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes and thought for a minute and without

216
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,759
even opening his eyes, he said to me, well, I think it's fine but we shouldn't forget that

217
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,920
molecules like vitamin C serve many functions in the body.

218
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,440
They're not strictly committed to being only antioxidants.

219
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,920
They also have very other important properties and we shouldn't forget that and I agreed

220
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,880
with them completely but he gave his blessing to our provisional title for the conference.

221
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,640
So he also agreed to be the keynote speaker at the conference and this was scheduled for

222
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,520
the fall of 1994, September and people like Bruce Ames and Balthes Frye, Maret Traiber,

223
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,200
Lester Packer, Enrique Cadenas, a lot of people in the free radical field were there.

224
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,120
And I hadn't met some of these people before, I'd met Bruce Ames and Balthes Frye as early

225
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,080
as 1989 when they came to the institute to give a seminar on vitamin C because Ames

226
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:49,399
had published with Frye a paper in PNAS that year showing that a score bay is the outstanding

227
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:54,679
antioxidant in human blood and a pecking order at number one and Pauline of course was

228
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,319
very excited by that paper and they were invited to come and give seminars during the

229
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,960
day of the earthquake actually as it turned out.

230
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,240
So there were a lot of interesting people invited to speak at our conference and then of

231
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,039
course Pauline died at the end of August.

232
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,159
So I asked Henry Taube who was one of Pauline's friends and had done work in free radical

233
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,759
chemistry as well.

234
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,759
If he would step in as a substitute for Pauline and give the keynote address at our conference

235
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,240
and he was happy to do so, that was very gracious of him to consent to do that at the last

236
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,279
minute because he was very active at Stanford and I'm sure there were many demands on his

237
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,920
time and I thought it was terrific that he really rose to the occasion and agreed to give

238
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,519
that talk which went very well.

239
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,160
I drove him up to Tiburon, picked him up at Stanford and drove him to Tiburon that day

240
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,400
to give the talk and he did a outstanding job really, really thrilled to group there.

241
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:01,240
So after Pauline had died of course and before his death we were engaged in analyzing options

242
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,920
for the future of the institute and I discussed some ideas with some of the people that had

243
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:15,000
attended the therapeutic potential biological antioxidants in September and then was

244
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,320
approached in 1994, 1993, 1994, I was also working with a fellow named Bill Kemp who

245
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,560
was introducing me to people in different universities around the country and we had

246
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,120
been talking as I mentioned last time with people all over the place.

247
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,560
Bill had arranged for me to meet the governor of Oklahoma at the Jonathan Club in Los Angeles

248
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,960
because the governor of Oklahoma was on a trip as many governors do to try to get businesses

249
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,920
to relocate or move some of their operations to the state of Oklahoma because that's the

250
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,240
economic engine that drives the state.

251
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:06,759
So I met with the governor at the Jonathan Club, it was kind of a funny meeting that

252
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:13,680
was in a really luxurious room at the Jonathan Club and the governor was there with his chief

253
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,279
of staff and maybe a dozen or 14 other people, they were all paying wrapped attention to everything

254
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,880
that he said and did and they were all aligned on one side of a long, long conference table

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,680
and it was me on the other side of the conference table.

256
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:36,240
I had no people, I had no retinue, I had no advisers, just me and I had a great conversation

257
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,960
with him and he invited me and Linus Pond Jr to go to Oklahoma City to make a presentation

258
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,920
to the president of the university, the president of the foundation there which operates in

259
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,560
a similar way to the Oregon State University Foundation here with their relationship to the

260
00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:00,480
local university, or the state school I should say, but anyway getting back to more

261
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:10,679
specifically your question, other people came and made presentations to our board about

262
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,759
their ideas for relocation and one of the people who came was John Byrne who brought

263
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,200
with him, I believe he brought with him Dick Scanlan who was dean of research at that

264
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,440
time and Oregon State University in many ways, I mean just superficially seemed to be

265
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,080
a good fit because Linus Pond was his alma mater, he had already agreed to give his and his

266
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,400
wife's personal and professional memorabilia to Oregon State University to be housed in

267
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,480
a new special collections, forms are the nucleus of special collections, so it seemed like

268
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:50,440
a good fit but we weren't really sure about the specifically how the institute would work

269
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,240
into the program here and so John Byrne and Dick Scanlan talked about the centers and

270
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,599
institutes there were already extant at Oregon State University and how they were organized

271
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,799
and how they reported to and how they were staffed and so forth and they talked a bit about

272
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,960
the nutrition department and the work that was going on there, exercise and sports physiology

273
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,440
here in medicine, pharmacy, biochemistry and bio physics, environmental and molecular

274
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:24,720
toxicology, strong programs that seem to have some relevance to the institute's mission.

275
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,960
And that led to of course many discussions and meetings between staff at Oregon State

276
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,559
University and our staff at the Linus Pond Institute of Science and Medicine including hosting

277
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:45,359
a meeting between a committee that John Byrne had put together to seriously analyze

278
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,799
this prospect of the institute relocating to Oregon State University to find out whether

279
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:58,639
it was really a good thing to do or not, Joanne Leon, George Bailey, a number of other

280
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:03,679
people were on that committee and they came down to Palo Alto and I hosted them for

281
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:10,060
day and talked about the mission of the institute and how we had been funded historically, talked

282
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,400
a lot about the scientific work, a lot about the fundraising work.

283
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,560
They weren't really familiar with the term orthomolecular so we spent quite a lot of time thinking

284
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,120
about that and discussing it and I think they came to realize that some of the work that

285
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,480
Dave themselves were doing could be considered orthomolecular but they hadn't really applied

286
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,680
that term to their own work.

287
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,880
And I think as a result of those many meetings it became clear that there was a good fit between

288
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,880
the Linus Pond Institute and Oregon State University although it wasn't tenable to bring

289
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,920
the whole institute with all its employees up to Corvallis because there was just too

290
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,599
many people.

291
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,599
We had I can't remember what the specific number of employees was at that time but back

292
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,960
before the reorganization there were maybe 70, 75 people at the institute and then after

293
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,480
the reorganization that was dropped down to maybe 50 or so.

294
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,120
And of course with the institute moving to Oregon State University a lot of the administrator

295
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,440
functions that we had to assume ourselves in Palo Alto, we would no longer have to assume

296
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,600
so we had no need for a controller or bookkeeper or we still had need for a fundraiser but

297
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,920
of course the fundraising activities were going to be taken over by the OSU Foundation

298
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:35,440
so we didn't really need to have a fundraising staff to come with us to Oregon State University.

299
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,940
So we had broad and deep discussions about all those issues and the researchers at the

300
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:49,080
Linus Pond Institute of Science and Medicine who the dean of research and the ad hoc committee

301
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,799
formed by John Bern believed had the best chance of succeeding here at Oregon State

302
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,799
University.

303
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:01,000
We're asked to come up and meet the faculty and staff that they might interact with here

304
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
on campus in the different departments and so there were a number of visits back and

305
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,279
forth between OSU and LPISM.

306
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,559
And as a result of that Dick Scanlon was pretty frank with me about who might really succeed

307
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,879
at Oregon State University and what might be the most important part of the Linus Pond

308
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:31,159
Institute to bring up to Oregon State University and that led to the decision to bring a relatively

309
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,159
small nucleus of people about half a dozen to Oregon State University.

310
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,960
Now there were some people that I think could have made the transition had they wanted to

311
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,359
but they had for instance there was one fellow doing work that was supported by a department

312
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,820
of energy grant at the Institute in Palo Alto and his wife was a physician and they had

313
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,200
a comfortable life in the Bay Area and they really didn't want to leave and there were

314
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,040
other people who also were approaching retirement age and decided that it might just be best

315
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
to retire rather than move to Oregon.

316
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:12,480
So there were a lot of factors that came into play in determining who actually moved to

317
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:21,720
Corvallis but at the time we had a very, and I mentioned this the last time, a really

318
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,740
good contractual relationship with Unilever and Elizabeth Arden, it was continuing so the

319
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:35,660
people involved with that particular project were given offered jobs at Oregon State University

320
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:42,259
and a number of other people were as well.

321
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:48,100
I think they were about half a dozen, six or seven people total.

322
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:54,980
It was Karna McEvally who was an Irish biochemist working on the Arden supported project Vadim

323
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:01,740
Ivanov who was working in cardiovascular disease research and his wife Stetlana Ivanova.

324
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,660
She was a heat roomie who was doing some really good work in cytotoxic, trying to determine

325
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:19,740
the cytotoxic moiety of the vitamin C molecule and some of its derivatives myself, and it

326
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:29,140
could have been it, I'm the only one left, that's right, Connor McEvally left after the

327
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:36,220
contract supported work expired and that contract had a finite start and stop time.

328
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:44,259
Then Vadim Ivanov and his wife Stetlana decided to return to the Bay Area because they felt

329
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:48,460
more comfortable in the Bay Area, they really liked California quite a lot.

330
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:54,940
Vadim and Stetlana had come from the Moscow Cardiological Institute in Russia and found

331
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,700
California just paradise compared to what they left in Russia, and I think they just

332
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,059
had a terrific fondness for California, so they were unwilling to become permanent residents

333
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:12,180
here in Oregon, and what heat roomie left after some time.

334
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:19,620
We had an interim director at the Institute, Don Reed who I believe at that time was director

335
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,900
of the Environmental Health Science Center as well, and a member of the Biochemistry and

336
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Biophysics faculty.

337
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:33,940
Yeah, so he was providing some leadership, one of the first things that we did together

338
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:40,300
was to hire an office manager, we hired Barbara McVicar, I believe she was the first employee.

339
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,340
Actually the first employee was Obertais who was selected by the Oregon State University

340
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,380
Foundation to become our fundraiser, so I worked quite closely with Oberta in the

341
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,380
very early days in a prize in him of some of our fundraising history, telling him a little

342
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,820
bit about some of the contractual relationships we had that generated income from the Institute

343
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:08,500
and also some of the charitable foundations and philanthropies who have been very kind

344
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,340
to the Institute over the years and talked to him about some of our big donors and be

345
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,220
quests and so forth.

346
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I worked pretty closely.

347
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,380
Oberta had been coming down to Palo Alto to go through some of our fundraising files as

348
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,140
well to help him identify what was important to bring up to Oregon State.

349
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:32,059
And of course, one of the most precious resources that was transferred was our donor database

350
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:39,259
because Oregon State University, I think, recognized that absent large government grants,

351
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:44,539
it was going to be tough to keep the Institute going without reliance on the contract we

352
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:51,819
had with Arden and Unilever and also sustained giving by our donors.

353
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:58,539
So that was very important to keep that safe and to cultivate the donors and that began

354
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,059
even before we moved here.

355
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:05,700
So what sort of commitment did OSU make to the Institute and I guess by a person?

356
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,640
Well, the commitment was really spelled out in a document that we wrote jointly called

357
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:20,420
a Memorandum of Understanding which was signed in 1995 by Linus Pond Jr. myself, Paul

358
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,660
Risser who was the incoming president of Oregon State University.

359
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:31,259
It really spelled out how in the Institute's assets, including financial assets, fundraising

360
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:37,579
assets, physical assets, and personnel would be transferred here to the campus of Oregon

361
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:42,460
State University and the Oregon State University Foundation and how the Institute would go through

362
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:48,619
legal dissolution and also the expectations for what the University would provide from

363
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:55,539
the Institute in the future including, I think, a really key phrase about launching a capital

364
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:01,019
campaign to secure a building from the Institute as soon as that was feasible.

365
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,500
So right from the get go there was always the promise of a building for the Institute

366
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:14,579
because on any university campus spaces that are premium and I'm not sure who had been

367
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,579
in the departments.

368
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:19,119
I think Bob chemistry and bio physics may have been in the initial space that the Institute

369
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:25,220
occupied in Wendell-Gerahal but in 1995 after the Memorandum of Understanding had been executed

370
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,379
and renovation of this space on the fifth floor in Wendell-Gerahal was undertaken.

371
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:36,980
I would come up periodically to work hard with Dick Scanlon and others on the details and

372
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:45,780
logistics of the move from Palo Alto to Corvallis including an analysis of the laboratory

373
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
requirements.

374
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:52,660
So these laboratories were renovated, they were painted, the wood was spiffed up and polished

375
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,460
and sanded and new countertops were installed, air conditioning was installed because these

376
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,660
old leaps in the middle of the building didn't have air conditioning, building wide air

377
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,819
conditioning.

378
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:15,059
And there was an area that was the south part of the fifth floor of Wendell-Gerah which

379
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,700
was renovated for LPI.

380
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,340
There were still offices and laboratories there for other departments, oceanography

381
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,860
and atmospheric sciences to name one and some other people were still scattered throughout

382
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
that space.

383
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,460
It wasn't a contiguous LPI space from the west end around to the east end but it was

384
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,020
certainly satisfactory for the Institute's initial efforts here at Oregon State.

385
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:44,500
So the furniture, the laboratory equipment, centrifuges, laboratory supplies, chemicals,

386
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,700
paper, journals, a lot of the material from Pauling's office in Palo Alto, was all transferred

387
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,059
up, moved up in August of, excuse me, July of 1996.

388
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:05,299
And that was a very, very difficult process because we had, we managed to move ourselves,

389
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,860
we had professional movers of course, we hired to make this move but we had to make lots

390
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,340
of decisions in Palo Alto but what should be moved and what shouldn't be moved and what

391
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,340
could be recycled and what could be thrown away and so on and so forth.

392
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:25,900
So we filled up two dumpsters a week for well over a month with just junk that we had

393
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:30,300
no use for in the future and then of course everything was packed securely and brought up

394
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:38,539
here at Oregon State University and a lot of the journals and laboratory equipment that

395
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:44,180
wasn't in use immediately was stored in the sixth floor of Wannager and with some storage

396
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,500
on the fifth floor as well.

397
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,860
And then over time, especially after Boltz-Fry was recruited as the director of the Linus

398
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:58,340
Buying Institute here at Oregon State and following that because I think I mentioned

399
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:06,820
once before that when the candidates for director that in dad position came to interview on campus

400
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:11,219
I think they all asked the university administration the same question which is what are you going

401
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:16,219
to do to provide for growth for the institute, how will the institute grow.

402
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:22,220
And I think the university to its credit responded satisfactorily to those questions by offering

403
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:28,140
to set up a couple of faculty lines and startup packages in order to recruit new faculty.

404
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,740
So that was also something that I think it was an incentive in recruiting a good director

405
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:39,060
that we would have the ability to grow the institute built into the initial program.

406
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:47,460
So as Wann Boltz-Fry assumed that position and we said about recruiting new faculty,

407
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,259
the material that had been stored in the fifth floor had to be moved and at that time

408
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:56,900
a lot of the filing cabinets that stored Polling's files and manuscripts and so forth were

409
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:04,500
moved over here to special collections and a lot of the other stuff that we perceive

410
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,340
no need to keep old journals for instance that the library couldn't use and we really had

411
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,940
no need for or storage capacity physically and when it or were recycled.

412
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,940
So the university did mention some ongoing funding then it wasn't just an issue providing space

413
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,260
and saying that we'll have a foundation represents that I hope you raise money for all of through all

414
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,900
and give you some ongoing funding as well.

415
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,380
Well in the Memorandum of Understanding that ongoing funding to provide startup packages

416
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,380
and salary lines for additional faculty that was not part of the Memorandum of Understanding.

417
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:47,139
That was something that developed as a result of feedback from interviews for the director

418
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:52,900
among the director candidates and to be honest with you because I had not had professional

419
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,099
experience within a university environment nor had line as Polling Junior nor had the other

420
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:04,339
members of our Board of Trustees with the exception of a couple it wasn't something that we

421
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:11,619
anticipated so had we anticipated that we really needed to secure a mechanism at that time to

422
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:15,860
grow the institute we probably would have incorporated that in the Memorandum of Understanding but I

423
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:23,219
think that was an issue that escaped the analysis at that time it was only later that that was really

424
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,420
addressed but the idea for a building from the institute was there right from the beginning

425
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,380
because we recognized that the renovated part of Wintergar was not going to be sufficient.

426
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,100
Should the institute be successful that wasn't going to be big enough to hold the institute and

427
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,660
we thought that having our own building would be really a fitting tribute to Linus Polling

428
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,260
and I think John Byrne and people at Oregon State University agreed that that was important.

429
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,580
It sounds like President Byrne was crucial to this process having in the first place within

430
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,580
the Paul Risser around and working with his perspective as role was.

431
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:06,980
Well Paul Risser didn't have much to do with it mechanistically because he signed the

432
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,700
Memorandum of Understanding because by the time that document was generated John Byrne was

433
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,500
was leaving his president so Paul Risser was the incoming president and I think there were a lot

434
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,019
of press releases that about that time as well so Paul Risser had to respond as the new face of

435
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:26,980
Oregon State University about this move of the Linus Polling Institute and so forth but his

436
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:34,179
scientific training I believe was as a botanist so he probably had less appreciation for Pauling

437
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:40,340
scientific work than maybe people in the other biological sciences or in the physical sciences

438
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:46,019
like physics and chemistry he certainly was aware of Linus Polling but I think this was basically

439
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:53,219
John Byrne's baby and Dick Scanlon at that time assumed a really pivotal role, a very important

440
00:38:53,219 --> 00:39:00,579
role in helping the institute to integrate into Oregon State University so Paul Risser was

441
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:07,539
certainly aware of everything and very supportive of everything but did not play a really pivotal

442
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:12,099
role early on it was really Dick Scanlon who was working very hard in this area.

443
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:16,179
What were your initial impressions with the university and for Dallas?

444
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:28,179
Well I'll be frank my initial impressions were not great I had spent my life in the East Coast

445
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:35,699
near Boston and at Stanford near San Francisco which was a hive of activity intellectual cultural

446
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,700
activity academic activity Silicon Valley here burgeoned during my time there so it was a very

447
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,500
dynamic and kind of thrilling and overstimulating type of environment that I'd grown to love.

448
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:58,660
So coming up here to Corvallis Corvallis struck me as a very sleepy tab in those days didn't seem to

449
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:06,099
have a big bookstore in town didn't seem to have many movie theaters didn't seem to have a lot of

450
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:13,940
good restaurants and to be honest it surprised me because here's a college town with tens of

451
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,219
thousands of students and a lot of faculty who are very bright and energetic and I was surprised

452
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:26,500
that that kind of energy and intellectual dynamism which I'm sure existed here on campus didn't

453
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:34,980
translate into more that I could perceive in town so nevertheless I felt that this was the best

454
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,699
option for the institute and I felt compelled from a professional standpoint to work very hard

455
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:45,460
to ensure that the institute was a success because like Linus Paul in junior we didn't really want

456
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:52,420
to see this fail and see what could become a really successful working tribute to Linus Paul

457
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,860
and turn into a disaster so I felt personally and professionally committed to making this work and

458
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,860
I realized that it was probably imperative for me to become part of this process in moving from

459
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:09,059
California to Oregon at least initially to get the institute up and running and make sure that

460
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:15,059
everything was was happening appropriately and that we didn't really lose sight of the reason

461
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,059
that the institute existed in the first place namely the study of orthomolecular medicine.

462
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,619
I was a little surprised at kind of the parochial and kind of provincial

463
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:38,019
attitude of some of the faculty here at Oregon State nutrition and so forth seemed to be a

464
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:44,340
little old-fashioned to me but I thought there was I thought the institute would probably settle

465
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:49,940
in and do quite well and there were a number of faculty who were extraordinarily bright and excited

466
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,500
about the institute being here and they were the ones that we were going to be working with so I

467
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:01,139
felt that I felt very good about that but I was concerned really about my my own personal

468
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:05,780
satisfaction here in Corvallis. I mean I know that the ocean is an hour and a half away and

469
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:10,579
the mountains are an hour and a half away and Portland is an hour away and but everything's at

470
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:17,940
least an hour away and in Palo Alto I was very right in the midst of things San Francisco is a short

471
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:26,579
train ride half-hour by car at that so I was concerned about that but Corvallis has changed quite

472
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:43,220
a lot over the years as well I think George Bailey was very important as well he was in environmental

473
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,940
and molecular tax college and director of the Marine Freshwater Biomedical Sciences Center at the

474
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,060
time using trout as a model to study Carson and Genesis and he'd been part of this committee that

475
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,540
had been set up by Dick Skinner and John Burns to sort of investigate the association at the

476
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:05,460
institute with OSU also Chris Matthews who is the chairman of the department about chemistry and

477
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:12,820
about physics I think played a very important role and part of the reason these people are

478
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:19,220
important was that new faculty coming into the institute which was essential we're going to

479
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:25,059
have their academic homes in different departments across campus and maybe even in different colleges

480
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:31,780
across campus so it's very important for the institute to be well integrated and be close to

481
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:38,660
these departmental chairs and deans as well. Joanne Leong played a very important role early on

482
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:48,340
and Tim White I think was involved as well. I can't remember all the people who constituted

483
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:54,340
search committee for the director but a number of those people were also on the search committee

484
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:01,940
and we took that job extremely seriously and reviewed numerous applications and whittled the

485
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:08,019
field down to a number of really outstanding candidates and then set about presenting each member

486
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:16,900
of the search committee presented two candidates and the choice was overwhelming for Balsray which

487
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,340
was terrific. Also Phil Wanger who was I believe an environmental molecular tax college who

488
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,140
worked on Selenium at that time was also someone who was closely associated with institute.

489
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:35,220
The higher Balsray extracts the original watershed moment. It really was a hiring Balsray

490
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:42,820
who was working of course on vitamin C was very strategic he's a terrific scientist he had

491
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:48,019
terrific recommendations from Bruce Ames the National Academy of Science member and winner of the

492
00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:02,180
award. What is the award that Paul and got from Gerald Ford? National Mental Science winner as well.

493
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:16,100
So Bruce Ames recommended him extremely strongly and Balsad had we knew him as well or at least

494
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:22,099
I had known him for a few years since his parents to give a seminar at the institute back in

495
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:29,619
California and he had after leaving Bruce Ames lab as a postdoc at Berkeley he'd gone to Harvard

496
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:35,059
had a position there and was currently at Boston University School of Medicine to work on vitamin C

497
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:44,420
and atherosclerosis. So we felt that it would be terrific for the institute to get him because we

498
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:51,220
would ensure central importance of worth of molecular medicine and coincidentally one of Paul's

499
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,340
favorite molecules vitamin C would have a very prominent place in the institute's research and

500
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:05,220
Balsray would be a really terrific director and then with the faculty lines and startup packages

501
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:12,579
created by OSU the research office I think that really was an exciting time and that really showed

502
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:17,699
that you know we now had a mechanism for moving forward we weren't going to be we weren't going to

503
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:22,579
have to be completely dependent on fundraising from our donors in order to make the institute a

504
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:28,819
success. Now we're going to be able to be able to bring in high caliber faculty because of these

505
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:35,539
faculty lines and when those people were recruited things really started to of course progress pretty

506
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:41,139
dramatically. So a year later you hired Tori Hagan, Merrick Trayvert and Rod Dash. That's right. So the

507
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:46,900
backbone research back on the green institute all three are endowed with now. That's right. That's

508
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,019
right. That was very those were all very good decisions. Tori now is director of our healthy

509
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:57,460
aging program. Rod Dashwood is director of the cancer chemo protection program. Rod had been here

510
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:05,940
previously to work with George Bailey many many years ago and is one of the leading researchers in

511
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:13,860
phytochemicals and cancer in the world so that was a very important part of our research program

512
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,019
and Merrick Trayvert coming up from UC Berkeley from Lester Packers Lab. One of the world's authorities

513
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:27,139
on vitamin E so we thought that the combination of Tori Hagan working on agi-central micronutrients,

514
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:34,819
Rod working in phytochemical protection against carcinogenesis and Merrett working in

515
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:40,900
molecular mechanisms of vitamin E another very important physiologically antioxidant and

516
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:48,659
bolts fry working on vitamin C would really constitute a great attack in some of these problems

517
00:47:48,659 --> 00:48:00,259
that had interest in my spine. I think it's probably safe to say that. I think bolts

518
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:05,859
impressed all of them. Of course Merrett Trayvert new bolts already from their prior association

519
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:15,059
at UC Berkeley but I think I think his acumen and abilities and energy and reputation as a scientist

520
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:19,619
were really critical in attracting these other candidates who were hired.

521
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:33,380
That's right. That's right. It's always been a consideration a major consideration for

522
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:40,179
becoming a principal investigator in the institute and being selected from the enormously

523
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:47,299
large pool of qualified candidates the ability to support a research program through NIH or NCI

524
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:54,179
funding or independent funding is can't be understated and it's absolutely critical to be

525
00:48:54,179 --> 00:49:02,419
considered for a position like that and to achieve success in that kind of funding on a regular basis.

526
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:08,099
I think it speaks very well with a caliber of any candidate who's selected for that position.

527
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:15,860
David Williams was hired shortly. David Williams was doing very good work here in environmental

528
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:21,059
and molecular toxicology and also had assumed directorship of the Marine Freshwater Biomedical

529
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:28,179
Sciences Center so he also was very interested in phytochemical protection against Carson

530
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:32,900
and Genesis which fit right into the institute's mission and he's been a principal investigator

531
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:41,860
all this time as well. He was not recruited extremely. He was at OSU. George Bailey of course

532
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,460
continued to remain as a professor at OSU just retired a few years ago and I think we've been very

533
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:55,700
fortunate that none of the faculty we've recruited has left for a better job than he plays out so

534
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,220
I think it shows that the institute has become a collegial and productive home for people where

535
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:06,580
they feel good about their ability to carry out their research programs and like their colleagues.

536
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,820
At some point the institute changed its name from the Linus Polynesian to the Science Medicine

537
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,860
to just the Linus Polynesian to the reason why. Yeah well that's kind of the two organizations

538
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:28,420
overlapped so the institute as a 501c3 incorporated in the state of California was known from 1973

539
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:35,139
or 4 on as the Linus Polynesian Institute of Science and Medicine. The institute as it exists

540
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:40,019
here at Oregon State University has always been known as the Linus Polynesian Institute and is

541
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:46,740
was independent from the Linus Polynesian Institute of Science and Medicine. When the institute moved

542
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:52,980
here we transferred our as I said our financial assets physical assets and some personnel

543
00:50:53,860 --> 00:51:00,900
to establish the Linus Polynesian Institute at Oregon State University but the Shell Organization

544
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,579
continued to be viable in the state of California for actually quite a few years after that

545
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:12,579
and there were a number of reasons for that. One reason was we wanted to continue to be the recipient

546
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:17,860
of be quests that named specifically the Linus Polynesian Institute of Science and Medicine

547
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:26,260
and there were a couple of be quests in the offing in which the executors and attorneys handling

548
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:33,300
the estate weren't sure that they could recognize Oregon State University of the Oregon State

549
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,539
University Foundation as the successor to the Linus Polynesian Institute of Science and Medicine.

550
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:44,740
So we thought rather than imperil any of these large be quests and there were several that

551
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,620
were quite large that it would just be best to continue that Shell Organization that could be

552
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:54,580
the recipient of some of these funds and be quests. There were also legal issues that needed to be

553
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:02,020
tied up. There was litigation with Rex E. Gerowalla about wrongful termination that needed to be

554
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:07,860
resolved. There was litigation continuing and litigation with the TSRAF that needed to be resolved

555
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:18,740
and there were, see, mainly financial and legal issues that were still dangling.

556
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,380
I didn't know that about Gerowalla.

557
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:31,940
Yeah, everybody in California as I might have mentioned was at will that was employment status

558
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,579
and it's very popular employment status in the state of California where you don't offer people

559
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:41,940
contracts. It would have been nice to offer people long-term contracts but it really was not

560
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:50,179
economically feasible to do that. We're prudent because the institute had no reliably safe source

561
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:57,539
of chronic funding. We didn't have an endowment and as you know as you're well aware the

562
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:02,819
income was up and down over the years. So in California there's what's known as at will employment

563
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:10,660
which means that you can be fired virtually anytime for no cause or you could leave at any time

564
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:17,780
with no notice. But it mainly benefits the employer, not the employee. And I feel terrible about

565
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:24,100
continuing that policy but it really there was really no way to move to any other kind of policy

566
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:31,380
at that time in Palo Alto. And of course the Linus Planning Institute of Science and Medicine really

567
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:39,380
had no absolute influence on which employees from that organization would be offered jobs

568
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,019
by Oregon State University. So the Linus Planning Institute of Science and Medicine was not making

569
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:50,019
job offers to its own employees to come to Corvallis to take a position. Oregon State University

570
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:59,619
was making those offers. So when it became clear which staff members in Palo Alto would be offered

571
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:04,259
jobs and which weren't offered jobs, then the people who were not going to be offered jobs.

572
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:09,219
Some retired, some had made a decision, some resigned made a decision that they didn't want to go

573
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:18,179
to Oregon anyway. And some were laid off. And Rex C. Jerawalla in turn sued the institute for

574
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:25,299
wrongful termination. And that was another one of these outstanding, excuse me, litigations that was

575
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:33,140
a reason why the institute could not go out of business right away. So there was a period of

576
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,100
overlap. There was the Linus Planning Institute here at Oregon State University and there was a

577
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,260
continuing shell organization in California, the Linus Planning Institute of Science and Medicine.

578
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:50,019
Another reason was that we had entered into a contract with Arden and Unilever and that contract

579
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:55,139
with the Linus Planning Institute of Science and Medicine. So there were lots of complicated legal

580
00:54:55,139 --> 00:55:01,219
and financial issues that all of us agreed seem to be resolved by just keeping the institute,

581
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:06,900
a shell organization until all these loose ends could be tied up. And then that finally was achieved

582
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:17,380
about 2005. 2003-2005, I can't remember the exact year but that's finally when the institute

583
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:22,980
went through legal dissolution and transferred remaining assets to Oregon State University Foundation.

584
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:29,300
So I served kind of two roles. I served continuing to serve as the chief executive officer

585
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:36,260
of LPSM and then also the administrative officer for LPI here at Oregon State University.

586
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:46,580
In 2000, one of your more interesting and successful sort of public outreach efforts to

587
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,980
micro-metry of information center came online. I wanted to talk about that a little bit.

588
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,380
One thing that's interesting and looking at it is that by that point, the institute is definitely

589
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,820
back the way from the negative claims about Lyons State. It's getting 40 kilograms as far

590
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,660
as Dr. Moore calling us. He's talking about and who is active. I'm wondering if you got

591
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:12,260
left sort of the conversation behind that. Sure. Well, there's never been a litmus test for

592
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,500
employment at the Linus Planning Institute even in California. And people have different

593
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,700
behavior as far as supplementation goes. There were people in California at the institute who took

594
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,940
large doses of vitamin C and vitamin E and multivitamins. There were people who didn't take supplemental

595
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:33,940
vitamins. So it's never been a litmus test and nobody has ever been forced to tow the party line

596
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,500
about vitamin supplements. Everybody's free to make up their own mind about what to do and what

597
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:47,139
to recommend and so forth. I think the scientists associated with the Linus Planning Institute that

598
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:54,340
came on board here in Oregon all had without fail, tremendous respect for Linus Polling.

599
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:01,300
But probably as good scientists were a little skeptical of the enormous mega doses that

600
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:08,340
Polling advocated and therefore weren't comfortable in recommending these kinds of doses

601
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:14,579
themselves because they either hadn't done the research to convince them that the magnitude of

602
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:22,100
these doses was warranted in each and every case or you know that's my guess is they just weren't

603
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:27,940
familiar with a lot of Polling's arguments about this. So the Micronutrient Information Center

604
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:36,819
came about in the year 2000. I think partly as a result of conversations at early retreats

605
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:43,219
and also feedback from the scientific advisory board about the institute being a resource for

606
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:50,339
peer-reviewed scientifically accurate and updated information on the role of micronutrients

607
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:56,260
including vitamins and minerals and phytochemicals and dietary constituents in preventing disease,

608
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:03,140
treating disease when applicable and also in attaining optimum health. We had an idea somewhat

609
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:09,059
similar to this on a more limited scale back in California where we had talked about becoming a

610
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:15,940
resource for a worldwide resource for vitamin C information specifically because we had some

611
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:23,940
expertise in vitamin C obviously through Linus Polling and other staff members and we had talked

612
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,220
about that if there was some way to to become a resource for that kind of information and again

613
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:35,700
this was before the the internet had really taken off so it would have required hiring people with

614
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:40,900
more knowledge about nutrition and molecular biology and the intersection between nutrition and

615
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:47,780
molecular biology and medicine and we just didn't have the funds to do that at that time and it

616
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:53,300
was also probably not prudent because there was a lot of uncertainty about the future of the

617
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:59,300
institute so it would have been foolhardy to set up a new program only to lose it with the move

618
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,700
of the institute to a new location or the liquidation of the institute or something like that so we

619
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:10,820
never acted on that dream at that time but then this kind of resurfaced in a broader sense

620
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,420
before the year 2000 and the idea then of course the internet had really taken off to make

621
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:25,380
this an electronic electronically accessible database and we started thinking about who would be

622
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,660
appropriate to set up and manage such a database and we felt somebody with a PhD in nutrition

623
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:37,620
or in molecular biology related to nutrition and somebody with some computer skills would be

624
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:43,699
required to do this so at that time Jane Higden had just gotten a PhD in nutrition from

625
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:50,659
Oregon State University and was not interested in pursuing a career in experimental science

626
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:57,059
wasn't really interested in securing a tenure track position in academia but was interested in

627
00:59:57,059 --> 01:00:02,739
staying in the scientific realm so she applied for that position and she was perfectly suited for it

628
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:07,139
she had had experience as a nurse in New York City I think she got a nursing degree from

629
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:12,099
PACE University and had gotten an undergraduate degree in biology from Stanford so she was

630
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:18,900
quite smart and had great experience and was willing to take on this task of setting up our

631
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:24,339
Migrant Community Information Center and we also hired somebody to work with her who could do the

632
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,539
initial computer work and software that was required to get this up and running

633
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:39,059
excuse me so the two of them collaborated on this and over the years it's developed into quite

634
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:42,259
an astonishing resource and to the extent that

635
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:51,539
when we thought about updating Pauling's book Had a Live Longer and Feel Better and this is

636
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:56,739
something that Paulie himself had pursued back in the 80s and he'd signed a contract with Brian

637
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,820
Lieberwitz as a matter of fact to work on an update of how to live longer feel better but

638
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,940
I think they had a disagreement about the strategy there in the scope of the work and that

639
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:12,260
really came to not but Linus Point Jr. and I were very interested in getting a new addition

640
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,660
of how to live longer and feel better published and we talked to a number of people that we thought

641
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:23,460
would be good candidates including Gladys Block we wanted somebody who was sympathetic to Pauling's

642
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,980
ideas and orthomolecular medicine but also extremely knowledgeable and kept up with the literature

643
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:36,420
and so forth to find someone to do that who already has a productive research career is really

644
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:43,300
difficult and we weren't able to locate anyone to carry out that work and then with the advent of

645
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:50,579
our Migrant Community Information Center it occurred to me that that was really an electronic update

646
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:55,299
of Pauling's book because now we were continuing to stay abreast of all the research information

647
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:04,659
in orthomolecular medicine and instead of compiling it into a book it was online so we decided

648
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:10,019
when the prospect of publishing an anniversary edition of How to Live Long and Feel Better came up

649
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:14,099
and I approached Oregon State University Press about that

650
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:24,500
we decided to keep the book intact add back some illustrations and other work that had been

651
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:29,699
deleted because when the book went from trade paper back sides on nice paper to

652
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:36,579
mass market paper back sides on coarse paper some of the resolution of the type was lost and

653
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:40,900
some of the illustrations just weren't appropriate so they were deleted from that mass market paper

654
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:48,740
we wanted to bring those back and decided that the best way of doing this new edition of the book

655
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:54,500
which would be the 20th anniversary edition would be to have a new forward written and afterward

656
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,300
kind of put the work in context with on the basis of new research that had been done since the book

657
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:08,420
was first published in 1986 and also makes some judicious annotations where people at Pauling

658
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:13,460
refers to for instance in the present tense who have died maybe indicate that the people have died

659
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:20,180
or if the RDAs changed maybe indicate why the RDAs changed or the UL and things like that so

660
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,780
we really limited to tinkering with the text to annotations and then providing some more text at

661
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:31,619
the beginning and end of the book and then directing people in the afterward to visit the

662
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:35,860
Micronutrient Information Center because that really provides an update of how to live longer and

663
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:45,780
feel better and over the years as the number of chapters grew in that Micronutrient Information Center

664
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:53,460
and it became and was always widely accessible through search engines it's becoming enormously

665
01:03:53,460 --> 01:04:00,900
popular so recently it's been getting on on the order of 20 to 25 million hits per year

666
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,980
and most of those of course are not local they're all over the country all over the world

667
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:15,139
and it's been a terrific resource for people to use in consulting with their physicians about

668
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:20,820
health problems or to find out more about the biochemical or physiological action of some of these

669
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:26,099
important Micronutrients the emphasis in the Micronutrient Information Center has always been on

670
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:32,980
human health so we will revert to discussing cell culture or animal studies when there

671
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:38,179
doesn't seem to be much human data available but the focus is really on humans because humans are

672
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:42,019
the ones that are reading this they're the ones that are interested in applying this information to

673
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:48,819
their own health and that's been the focus and the information that has been written by Jane Higdon

674
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:55,380
and she was succeeded by Dr. Victoria Drake and now we have another person working with Victoria

675
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:02,980
Drake on the Micronutrient Information Center on Johnna Angelo all the articles that they

676
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:08,900
write are sent out to leading experts in the field for peer review and then they're periodically

677
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:15,460
updated as well to take into account new information new studies that might cause the institute to

678
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:20,340
modify its recommendations so the end of each of these chapters ends with a line is applying

679
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:27,700
recommendation and in many cases it's very similar to or the same as the DRIs that the food

680
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:32,820
nutrition board publishes in some cases it's different and in the case of vitamin C for instance

681
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:38,900
it's different we don't recommend the enormous quantities that line is applying recommended

682
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:46,820
in part because pharmacokinetic studies and molecular studies have revealed that the amount of

683
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:54,100
vitamin C absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream is limited by the sodium vitamin C transporters

684
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,340
which are relatively newly discovered they hadn't been discovered by the time Pauline died

685
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:06,660
but they are known now and it explains why only a fraction of a very small dose of vitamin C gets

686
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:11,380
from the gut into the bloodstream it's limited it's controlled by these vitamin C transporters so

687
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:17,140
it just doesn't diffuse you know against a gradient or something it really is limited

688
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:24,660
so practically speaking and biochemically it doesn't make sense to take a huge dose of vitamin C

689
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:32,820
because only a small fraction of that will be absorbed so we decided on the basis of meta-analyses

690
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:39,460
on basis of biochemical epidemiological studies that it's important to keep blood levels of

691
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:47,139
vitamin C very high that produce not really saturation but very high concentrations in circulating

692
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:52,260
cells in the blood and also cells in different tissues because vitamin C is very important and non-toxic

693
01:06:53,059 --> 01:07:01,539
so we recommend now to get at least 400 milligrams a day so by saying at least 400 milligrams a day

694
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:07,139
we recognize that it's important to get much more than what the RDA is for instance

695
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:10,980
and we also recognize implicitly the safety of high dose vitamin C

696
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:18,420
so we don't specifically recommend many grams a day but we recognize also that high dose

697
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:24,500
vitamin C is very safe as a matter of fact the UL which is the upper tolerable upper level of intake

698
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:33,779
for vitamin C was established in 2000 at 2000 milligrams per day based solely on the transient

699
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:39,380
laxative effect of higher doses in some people which is really not a serious side effect

700
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,540
it's not really pathological or toxic

701
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:52,740
is the argument in favor of intravenous vitamin C in the possible therapeutic procedure that

702
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:58,980
does that still have a question? Well actually that's been greatly reinvigorated by some of these

703
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:04,740
pharmacokinetic studies after the Mayo Clinic studies as we discussed there was kind of a dismissal

704
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:09,780
of vitamin C the utility of vitamin C as a therapeutic agent in cancer and a lot of oncologists and

705
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:16,420
physicians became very uninterested in vitamin C this pedestrian molecule it's already been studied

706
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:22,819
by the Mayo Clinic it's failed so therefore it's time to move on however pharmacokinetic studies

707
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:29,380
that really demonstrated very clearly in these transport studies in molecular biology

708
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:35,699
something might throw

709
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:44,420
showed that when you give vitamin C intravenously you get much higher concentrations in the blood

710
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:50,579
than you do when you take it orally in depending upon the dose given intravenously you can end up

711
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:55,859
with millimolar concentrations in the blood when you take vitamin C orally it's tough to get

712
01:08:55,859 --> 01:09:02,180
above about 200 micromole per liter in the blood concentration so millimolar you're talking about

713
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:08,899
70 or 100 times greater concentration of vitamin C when given intravenously and that led people

714
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:16,260
conducting these pharmacokinetic studies to think more carefully about why Cameron's work with

715
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:21,780
Pauline was so successful in Scotland and why the Mayo Clinic's work in Minnesota failed

716
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:29,539
and it's pretty clear that these these high levels of vitamin C exhibit cytotoxicity selective

717
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:35,380
cytotoxicity against tumor cells and this has been shown in cell culture experiments for many many

718
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:40,820
many years and even in the early 1980s Pauline himself published with Japanese colleagues

719
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:48,979
a paper showing that vitamin C had cytotoxicity against tumor cells in culture

720
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:55,699
and that this was completely nullified by the addition of catalysts to the culture medium

721
01:09:55,699 --> 01:10:00,979
and catalysts of course quenches hydrogen peroxide so they surmise that the cytotoxicity was due

722
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:06,739
to vitamin C acting as a prooxenant and generating hydrogen peroxide which was then killing tumor cells

723
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:13,779
so this very mechanism was then rediscovered many years later and shown to occur when you get

724
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:18,659
these pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C in the blood when given intravenously

725
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:23,699
it starts generating hydrogen peroxide which attacks tumor cells and it seems to be very selective

726
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:28,340
either normal cells are protected by endogenous antioxidants or some other protective mechanism

727
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:35,219
as it play and that led to renewed interest in the prospect of using high dose IV vitamin C

728
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:42,100
as a junk of therapy and cancer and there have been many many anecdotal studies published case

729
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:49,140
histories published and a couple of phase one clinical trials published as well so I think there's

730
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:54,180
quite a lot of interest now but there are also quite a lot of issues that need to be much more

731
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:00,579
fully characterized for instance which types of human cancer are most sensitive to these high

732
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:07,380
concentrations of vitamin C which patients are the best candidates for high dose vitamin C at what

733
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:17,220
stage of cancer can vitamin C be given with chemotherapy drugs in a synergistic manner would

734
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:23,300
vitamin C negate the effect of some types of chemotherapy drugs should it be used in connection with

735
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:30,420
radiotherapy and what would be the optimum protocol for administration of vitamin C

736
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:38,500
for instance Cameron with his terminally old patient population these people were hospitalized

737
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,980
waiting to die so he could give continuous slow drip intravenous vitamin C high dose vitamin C

738
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:52,900
hour after hour day after day so retrospectively you're thinking about this and thinking that

739
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:58,739
hydrogen peroxide must have been rather continuously generated and rather continuously

740
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:06,180
attacking these tumor cells in vivo for many patients now who get high dose IV vitamin C it's given

741
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:13,140
in a periodic fashion two or three times a week very high doses so hydrogen peroxide is being

742
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:20,180
generated transiently and then after four to six hours the level of vitamin C in the blood is

743
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:26,980
right back at baseline no more hydrogen peroxide generation presumably so those kinds of issues whether

744
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:33,860
it's okay to have periodic generation of hydrogen peroxide through what kind of intermittent IV

745
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:39,060
vitamin C use or whether this continuous generation of hydrogen peroxide is more effective all these

746
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:45,860
issues are very nuanced and difficult and I think have to be really thoroughly characterized before

747
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:53,539
we'll really understand the merits of vitamin C against cancer but there are people that are

748
01:12:53,539 --> 01:13:01,299
actively working in that area and they recognize all these issues. In 2001 the institute hosts its

749
01:13:01,299 --> 01:13:06,339
first diet and not coming to the health conference and that also came with the first LPI advice for

750
01:13:06,339 --> 01:13:11,779
the health research which is a $50,000 prize pretty remarkable time around for an organization that

751
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:17,460
is continuing on the treatment going out of business in 15 years before. Really amazing turnaround and

752
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:24,099
part of that has to do with I think Rick Hicks cultivation of donors over the years by always

753
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:29,859
putting information about bequest and playing gifts in the periodic newsletter that went out to

754
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:37,619
our constituents so people were aware from the mid-70s on and named the institute in their wills

755
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:45,220
and those bequest that came in very irregularly and unpredictably to the institute allowed us to

756
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:50,659
do really wonderful things including a doubt endowing new faculty positions within the institute

757
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:56,180
convening things like the diet and optimum health conference and giving that prize for health

758
01:13:56,180 --> 01:14:03,220
research and also the fact that the cost of doing business here at Oregon State was much less

759
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:08,820
because we weren't having to pay rent any longer we weren't having to pay people to

760
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:15,619
participate in a large fundraising program or pay a controller bookkeeper and so forth so

761
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:21,460
a lot of the activities that had to be supported as an independent organization did not have to be

762
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:28,659
supported in this context of Oregon State University so costs were down and therefore the bequest

763
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:33,220
and the money that was coming in could be could be applied towards growth of the institute

764
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:40,819
instead of just merely sustaining the institute. Also in 2001 Jill Beckman arrived at the institute

765
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:47,139
talking a little bit about the background behind that and the fact that he is working ALS into

766
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:51,779
sort of open up a different angle of research for the institute. That's right there always been

767
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,260
interest of course in neurodegenerative diseases at the institute and

768
01:14:56,739 --> 01:15:02,820
we were looking for a candidate who could open up that new area of research and

769
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:08,980
Jill Beckman was one who applied and he'd done some really outstanding work on molecular work on

770
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:13,940
ALS in Birmingham Alabama at the University of Alabama

771
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:20,500
showing that Paroxy nitrite is a very interesting destructive molecule that is generated

772
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:29,460
through the evolution of nitric oxide in the body very damaging molecule so his work really appealed

773
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:35,619
to us reactive nitrogen species was kind of a new avenue of research reactive oxygen species work

774
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:41,060
of course have been undertaken by many people all around the world for many years including some

775
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:47,699
at LPI but reactive nitrogen species was kind of a new a new facet of this that would be very

776
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:57,139
interesting pursue and he was given the Aether Helen Pauline in dad position because we thought it

777
01:15:57,139 --> 01:16:02,739
would be would be nice to honor Linus Pauline's wife with another with the second in dad position

778
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:10,420
and at that time we had the money thanks to Bequest in order to do that and also some of the money

779
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:16,979
that came into the institute at that time was not just from Bequest but also from legal actions

780
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:21,699
as an example when the insurance companies refused to

781
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,139
reimburse us for legal expenses during the raffle litigation

782
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:34,739
I decided to sue the insurance companies because they weren't honoring our claims

783
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:41,619
and they made up reasons why you know they couldn't honor the claims but nevertheless are

784
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:47,300
commercial liability and directors and officers insurance I thought would apply

785
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:51,380
and I was shocked that they refused to honor these claims so we decided to sue them

786
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:56,820
and that was settled before going to trial and that resulted in quite a large amount of money

787
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:02,420
coming to the institute as well so we had money coming in from a number of different avenues that

788
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:10,500
allowed us to adopt these positions. Just a couple more questions we talked about the principal

789
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:15,539
investigators and balls and when it did any of the folks that have been made their figures in the last

790
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:24,899
10 years or so we're trying to have the institute. Well I think clearly the people who were

791
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:31,779
operating the research office were have been very important because balls probably reports

792
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:37,939
to the head of the research office and the money that are available through returned overhead

793
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:43,699
and through the research office have been very important to the institute over the years

794
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:52,420
the deans and departmental chairs have also been extraordinarily important because when candidates

795
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,579
are being interviewed and reviewed for a faculty position within the institute as a principal

796
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:03,300
investigator at the institute they have to have an academic home as well which means that the

797
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:11,859
chairperson of the appropriate academic unit and his or her colleagues and faculty members have

798
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:16,259
to vote on whether or not this candidate will fit into their department so it's a very

799
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:23,139
convoluted and entwined process of selecting someone for the institute and for

800
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:28,099
an academic department so all the departmental heads have been quite important as well.

801
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:37,299
That was your job change over time. Well my job has changed in so far as I obviously am no

802
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:42,100
longer the chief executive officer of the Linus Pong Institute of Science and Medicine which was

803
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:47,460
kind of a parallel track for me and once that was finally legally dissolved and I didn't have to

804
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:55,220
think about that any longer and basically could focus on my responsibilities as administrative

805
01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:01,779
officer for the institute and from the when we first moved here I took over editor ship of the

806
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:06,900
newsletter because we recognized that the newsletter continued to be an important educational

807
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:14,420
tool and fundraising tool for the institute and I thought I could do it and Don read thought I

808
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:22,100
could do it so I just started to do that unilaterally and that's been a lot of fun. We have historically

809
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:30,260
given out pilot project grants to fund initial research by people doing work related to the

810
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:36,420
institute of the mission in order to allow them to obtain enough data to apply for larger

811
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:42,739
more sustaining grants from say NCI or NIH and the work that they've done has always been reported

812
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:49,140
in the newsletter so talking to those people getting asking them for articles for the newsletter

813
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:54,579
editing those articles trying to translate that information from a very technical

814
01:19:56,659 --> 01:20:01,460
language to language that's a little more friendly to the casual reader has been a lot of my

815
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:09,619
responsibility and then of course pursuing this option of a new building for the institute

816
01:20:09,619 --> 01:20:14,980
it's been something that balls Ryan I've been working on right from the beginning very diligently

817
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:20,420
and then when the funding finally came together for that even before the funding came together

818
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:25,220
we spent quite a lot of time talking to architects and visiting buildings and so forth trying to

819
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:32,180
get a clearer idea of what it was we wanted and also to provide us with material that could be

820
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:38,579
shown to prospective donors so we wanted to have a good idea of what the institute could look like

821
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:46,020
what the new building could look like and have something that we could show to people a visual

822
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:50,900
representation of this model or something like that so he and I worked very closely on

823
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:58,580
on all that work and I became a member of the steering committee for the Linus Pong Science Center

824
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:03,460
so I'd say for the last couple of years two or three years I've been working very intensively

825
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:10,020
with user groups trying to identify issues that needed to be incorporated into the design and

826
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:17,620
given to the architects to design our building and also there's always been a bit of a fundraising

827
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:23,059
component to my position as well because I have such a long history with the institute and I know

828
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:30,180
about a lot of our past activities and I knew Linus Pong pretty well I'm often asked by our fundraiser

829
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:36,019
or other groups the Rudry Club, Blinds Club, different groups here at Oregon State University

830
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:42,260
and elsewhere to give talks on Pong and Orthomolecular Medicine or to provide

831
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:50,180
overviews of the research that's going on at the institute now and I rather often in two or

832
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:56,579
three times a year travel to scientific or medical conferences to make presentations on Pong and

833
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:02,980
Orthomolecular Medicine and to give those kinds of updates. My last set of questions is about the

834
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:11,460
building and opened this last September more or less and you obviously involved in that process

835
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:20,740
well it's just such a terrific change from the institute. One of her as I said was completely

836
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:27,300
satisfactory in the early days for the institute but as the institute grew we became very fragmented

837
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:32,740
because we had faculty in different buildings all over campus and it became less and less

838
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:39,859
likely to interact with fellow faculty who were part of the institute and of course I think that

839
01:22:39,859 --> 01:22:48,579
decreases the collegiality and also diminishes the prospect for good meaningful scientific interactions

840
01:22:48,579 --> 01:22:53,619
on a frequent basis that could generate new ideas and make progress in research projects.

841
01:22:54,819 --> 01:23:01,460
So the new building has allowed almost all the institute principal investigators to be housed

842
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:07,300
together now. Joe Beckman is still in ALS but it's just a stone's throw from the Linus Pong

843
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:12,739
Science Center which is next to Nash which is the building that sits between ALS and the Linus Pong

844
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:17,699
Science Center so he's still physically very close to the institute although not part of the building

845
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:29,619
itself and being in a very spacious well lit modern building with open lab space and modular space

846
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:36,579
that's quite flexible is just such a such a wonderful inspiration for everyone and the interaction

847
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:42,019
with your colleagues now is dramatically increased as well because all the offices are aligned along

848
01:23:42,019 --> 01:23:48,819
the north wall on the third floor and the fourth floor and there's an open atrium kind of a cathedral

849
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:55,300
less environment between the third and fourth floor a staircase in the middle there allows people

850
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:00,659
to get from one floor to the other so there's just this feeling of openness and integration that

851
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:14,579
is really wonderful. Well the next set of priorities I think are to expand and develop our

852
01:24:14,579 --> 01:24:20,500
Micronutrient Information Center and also work on a new program in our outreach which is called

853
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:28,659
the Healthy Youth Program which is trying to introduce the concepts of good nutrition and lifestyle

854
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:35,699
among elementary school children and middle school children so that kids can get good ideas about

855
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:42,819
how to stay healthy when they're young in terms of exercise and eating well and also we still have

856
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:50,180
the ability to recruit more faculty for a healthy aging program. Once we recruit more faculty

857
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:57,300
for a healthy aging program I think we'll be saturated with respect to four principal investigators

858
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:06,420
per area having labs in the Linus Pong Institute. Well that's the end of my questions are there any

859
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:10,180
things that we didn't cover that come to mine off hand that we should talk about as far as

860
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:21,140
we can. Probably but I can't think of anything off hand so let me think about that.
