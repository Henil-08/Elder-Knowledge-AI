1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
my throat these days. Okay, so now we are going. All right, so, as with all the others, please introduce yourself.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,720
Steve Lawson, today's date is December 15th, 2011, we're in a conference room at the Valley Library.

3
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,440
Okay, Steve, so today we're going to do something a little different from past

4
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,879
sessions. What we're going to do is essentially, this goes through a list of names of people that

5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,079
either worked at the Institute or were affiliated with some way of asking you to sort of give your

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,640
recollections as to rules they played an institute and any sorts of memorable interactions you had with them.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
Okay, and a lot of these folks, if you've always touched on over the course of our talk,

8
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,759
are you ready? So the first one is Zelda Herman. Zelda Herman joined the Institute. I believe in the

9
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,799
late 1970s he had had an academic position at Stanford University and had come up

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,640
from New York City prior to that and worked very closely with Linus Pawn on theoretical problems

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,760
in structural chemistry to the best of my recollection early on. He also had a strong background

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,480
in statistics so he helped people at the Institute with biostatistical analyses and I believe

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
participated in the analysis of some of the data that you and Cameron was generating

14
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,400
cancer mortality data with vitamin C and cancer studies in Scotland.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:36,320
In the mid to late 1980s Linus Pawn came up with an idea for a novel fabrication technique

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000
for superconductive material that was different from the prevailing ceramic

17
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,960
work that many people were doing and Pawn approached Zellik and myself to set up a laboratory

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,720
in Stanford Industrial Park to carry out some experiments to confirm his ideas about the

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,400
way that this material could be fabricated that would be in support of his patent application.

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,159
So Zellik and I sat about buying a furnace and blowtorch and we had a facility already at

21
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,960
Porter Drive and we were just using a few rooms in this facility and Zellik came up with an

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,879
ingenious way to collect this material which essentially consisted of very thin

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,920
tin fibrils that were clad in borosilicate glass and the glass surrounded the tin

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,240
at the point of maximum temperature over a furnace helped a course by a blowtorch so we needed

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:43,600
to collect these long strands of tin encased in glass and Zellik came up with a terrific idea which

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,639
was kind of a bicycle frame upside down mounted on a wood platform and then we could there weren't

27
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,199
tires on the rims there were just bare rims and the idea was that we could make this a continuous

28
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,439
operation one person would be at the furnace wielding blowtorch melting the glass at a very

29
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:13,280
steady rate very controlled very steady very exact precise operation and then as that glass

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,199
was melted and the tin was melted it would be collected onto the back tire of this bicycle frame

31
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,639
and then somebody the other person Zellik or myself would be there threading the glass onto the

32
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:32,000
wire rim of the bicycle and then engaging the pedal mechanism to collect the glass on the

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,680
bicycle wire rim and it worked quite well and Zellik and I maintained a notebook according to

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,879
Linus Plunk standards that was countersigned by a music a Milser Krakhandel either at the end

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,360
of every day or at the end of every week so that a third party uninvolved with the experimental work

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,960
could testify that they had read it and understood it and I got to know Zellik pretty well through

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,120
that whole process and of course he'd been at the institute a very long time his tenure there

38
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,360
almost exactly coincided with mine I can't recall if I got there a little before him or

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,680
will after him but I know that he arrived in the late 1970s mid to late 1970s and I got to know

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
him very well over the years and really respected and admired and liked him as a person I think he had

41
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:26,400
the desire to devote his career to this relationship scientific relationship with Linus Pauling

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,120
and I think that Linus Pauling dependent on him very greatly for this work that he himself might

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,959
have not had time to do and Zellik was able to talk with Linus Pauling about some of these

44
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,480
more abstract problems and theoretical chemistry that the rest of us at the institute probably

45
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:57,360
were not able to converse easily with Linus Pauling about Zellik when the institute was wrapping

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,480
up its activities in Palo Alto and I have to say that Zellik was very important in that whole

47
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,080
operation he had become the institute's safety officer over time so he worked very carefully

48
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,319
and closely with Palo Alto fire department with our hazardous materials plan which we didn't really

49
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:21,439
have prior to Zellik taking that position and he also helped me a lot by kind of serving as my

50
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,439
sorry get when I was away from the institute at that time I was chief executive officer and when I

51
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:34,399
was gone Zellik very kindly and effectively offered to stand in for me and solve problems as

52
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,480
they arose at the institute in my absence which was he did a terrific job of that as well

53
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:47,439
and Zellik also participated very closely in the analysis of the closure of the institute

54
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,959
hiring the moving firm disposal furniture laboratory equipment chemicals and so forth so

55
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,639
he was he was involved in that whole process very very thoroughly on a day-to-day basis in

56
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,479
the last years of the institute the institute was not in a position to secure employment

57
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:17,279
of LPISM employees at Oregon State University so there have been a number of visits by Oregon State

58
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,000
University faculty and administrators to the Palo Alto facility to talk with our scientists there

59
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,959
about whether or not they were interested in coming to to Corvallis to become part of Oregon State

60
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,800
University and the Linus Plines Institute and whether it would be a good fit for those candidates

61
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:45,199
and Oregon State University academic units so Oregon State University ended up not offering

62
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,480
a position to Zellik to the best of my recollection and after that he did some work I believe for

63
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:01,439
Stanford and some other faculty in the Bay area and also did some teaching in the Palo Alto

64
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:17,280
public school system I believe and maybe elsewhere I was I was not involved in compiling or editing

65
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,640
or managing that project but they did an outstanding job Zellik is very very meticulous he has a

66
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:30,640
very keen eye for detail he'd make a good editor and he was he was driven to make sure that this

67
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,920
collected papers to Linus Paul in the inventory of these papers was as thorough and complete as

68
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,520
possible so he worked very closely with Dorothy on that project and of course Linus Pauling as

69
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:50,799
well because Pauling himself had to provide some reprints of some papers that were quite old and

70
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:57,680
and weren't part of the Linus Plines Institute of Science and Medicine inventory or library so that

71
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,000
was a really terrific project that Zellik and Dorothy did jointly and then of course that was sort

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
of the nucleus for a project that was then taken up by special collections here at Oregon State

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
University and then expanded to this five volume set that was recently published.

74
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,839
Dorothy was a terrific person she had been at the institute I believe nearly from its inception

75
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:34,000
and she worked ostensibly as Linus Pauling secretary but that term doesn't really do justice to

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,399
the comprehensive nature for duties and responsibilities she assisted Linus Pauling and all his

77
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,759
travel arrangements managed his calendar for appearances prepared his manuscripts to be submitted

78
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:57,200
for publication of different journals managed his correspondence and also transcribed his numerous

79
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,360
dictaphone dictation belts so she played a very very important role in Linus Pauling's life keeping

80
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,400
everything straight and organized and really providing personal and secretary on managerial

81
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,600
assistance to him and I think that she was invaluable I don't think he could have managed without

82
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:33,680
Dorothy Monroe Dorothy was an interesting person she was not very extroverted maybe a little skeptical

83
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,639
but I really I really enjoyed her we had some good laughs and mainly our humor was based on

84
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,279
sort of cynical takes on institute affairs but she when she found something funny she was

85
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:59,040
really prone to some hilarity but it took a bit to get over that threshold sometimes Richard Hicks

86
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,960
Richard Hicks had been at the institute when I joined he was a former stockbroker or

87
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:16,000
administrator with I believe Merrill Lynch so correct I have to check on that it was big stock

88
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:23,600
brokerage and they had a big office in San Francisco and Richard Hicks first wife had died of cancer

89
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
and that had stimulated his interest in what Pauling called orthomolecular medicine the prevention

90
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,759
and treatment of disease with micronutrients in particular vitamin C and Rick joined the institute

91
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:43,039
probably in the mid 1970s when art Robinson and Linus Pauling and the board probably became convinced

92
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:52,240
that we needed some managerial experience and direction at the helm of our fundraising efforts

93
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,799
which at that time included contact with foundations philanthropists large donors people interested

94
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:07,039
in Linus Pauling's work as well as a mailing list that provided a base for solicitation for

95
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:14,240
the institute so Rick kind of organized and managed all that and also was very engaged in certain

96
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,679
travels with Linus Pauling that had a fundraising aspect so he he traveled with Linus Pauling quite

97
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:36,399
often on the 70s and 80s he did you know there have been a couple of conflicts at the institute

98
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:45,759
one involved Pauling Hicks and art Robinson which led to art Robinson's departure and art I believe

99
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,959
at some point wanted to fire or tried to fire Rick Hicks and he was prohibited from doing that

100
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,240
expressly by the board and Linus Pauling which led of course to this administrative conflict that

101
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,000
led to arts departure there are other reasons for that of course but that was one element of that

102
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,720
conflict that arose in the late 1970s and then when Emile Zucacondo became president director of

103
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,919
the institute after Robinson's departure Rick Hicks worked very very closely with Emile over the

104
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:23,840
years to try to find financial funding for the institute's research activities and our educational

105
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,720
activities as well so the two of them worked extremely closely and then of course with Linus Pauling

106
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:38,080
as his schedule permitted to seek out cultivate and find to find and cultivate donors who could

107
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,960
support some of our projects at the institute and then when the institute was reorganized

108
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:51,600
after Emile's retirement Rick decided since I think partly I don't want to put words in his

109
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,519
mouth but I think he decided partly because of his long close association with Emile

110
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,000
that the time had come for him to to resign as well and as he resigned from the Linus Pauling

111
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,480
Institute of Science and Medicine he was offered a position on the board so we became a board member

112
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,879
of the board of trustees of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine and then also had

113
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:17,360
a position with Emile's embryonic institute institute for molecular medical sciences which was as

114
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,600
I discussed previously sub leasing space from us in the same facility at 440 page mail road

115
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,079
as did he retire after that job? Do you know where you should supply something else?

116
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,679
Well institute and molecular medical sciences to the best of my knowledge never really

117
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,720
reach critical mass. They had a few employees early on and then when the zoning change finally

118
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,120
kicked in and that building that they were located on a schedule for demolition I think that was

119
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:55,439
the effective end of the of that organization so I don't know whether Rick continued any

120
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:04,800
active role with IMMS after it was lost its physical existence there at 440 page mail road

121
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,560
but Rick has remained a big advocate and friend of the Linus Pauling Institute over all these

122
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,360
years and I talk with him reasonably often on the phone and he comes to visit us in Corvallis

123
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,920
during big events like the 10th anniversary party and so forth. He couldn't make it to the grand

124
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
opening of the Linus Pauling Science Center but he sent flowers and he's always been a good friend

125
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:39,040
of the Linus Pauling Institute. Well Emile is quite elderly now and I think he had

126
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:47,040
some kind of adjunct position at Stanford in one of their academic departments that probably

127
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:55,599
overlapped the existence of IMMS but I don't know if he retains any courtesy or adjunct appointment

128
00:14:55,599 --> 00:15:02,959
at Stanford any longer. I think so he's the founding editor of course of the Journal of Molecular

129
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,839
Evolution which is one of the leading journals in that field and I think he has retired as editor

130
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,199
of that journal he probably remains on the editorial board but I know his duties with respect to

131
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,480
that journal have diminished quite a lot as well so he may have an emeritus position with the journal

132
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:30,240
at this point. Rexie Jerry Walla joined the institute I believe from Johns Hopkins

133
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:41,840
in the early 1980s I believe to head the laboratory of viral carcinogenesis and at that time

134
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,320
Emile's plan for the institute was to expand along the lines of the Salk Institute in

135
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Mojolla kind of important projects in orthomolecular medicine and molecular biology

136
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,080
and Rexie's work was an example of the work in molecular biology in particular. He was

137
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:10,240
interested in Herpes virus type 2 and fragments of Herpes virus type 2 DNA that could transform

138
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:18,960
normal cells and make them tumorogenic. So he had a big program that was involved in that research

139
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,560
and I collaborated with him on several projects there was a donor named Robert Saven

140
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,639
in Long Island who developed some very interesting ideas about phytoc acid and cancer. Phytoc acid

141
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:38,320
is an antioxidant that you find in grains and seeds and it protects the germplasm material

142
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:46,000
in seeds from oxidative damage before germination and he had approached

143
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,840
either Linus Polymer and Emile Zucaconda with some of these ideas and then I started talking

144
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,680
with him about his ideas and we set up kind of a small experimental research program

145
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,559
to carry out some cell culture experiments and Rexie and I started directly collaborating at that

146
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:17,839
time and also we worked together on using 2D gel technology to profile proteins in rat cells that

147
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:26,399
had been transfected with these Herpes virus DNA fragments. So my developed quite a lot of experience

148
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:32,399
and skill at producing these protein profiles and Rexie was very interested in that to find out

149
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,519
how gene activity and protein expression changed as a result of neoplastic transformation in these

150
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,040
rat cells. So I collaborated with Rexie on a number of different projects over time and then of

151
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:54,880
course mid to late 1980s as AIDS was becoming kind of a public health crisis in the San Francisco

152
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,160
Bay area in New York and some other places. There was interest in finding out once HIV had been

153
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,560
identified as the causal factor there, the etiologic agent in developing arcane AIDS,

154
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,680
there was interest in finding out whether or not vitamin C might have any effect on protecting

155
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,560
people from dysvirus or have any beneficial effect in people that were already infected with a virus.

156
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,919
So in collaboration with Linus Pauling and Steve Herike who had been recruited to work in

157
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,480
Rexie's group they published a paper on PNAS in the late 1980s showing that in cell cultures

158
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,279
to human T lymphocytes infected with HIV did not develop certain pathological characteristics

159
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:50,559
when they were grown in physiologically relevant concentrations of vitamin C and vitamin C also

160
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,720
inhibited replication of the virus which could be assayed with a number of different techniques.

161
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:04,639
So the conclusion in that paper that I remember correctly was that there may be a combinatorial

162
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:12,559
approach to treating AIDS that would involve AZT which protects uninfected cells from getting infected

163
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,440
by HIV combined with vitamin C which would inhibit viral replication. So you're inhibiting viral

164
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,559
replication and protecting uninfected cells and maybe this would be a good therapeutic strategy

165
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,680
for AIDS patients. And that resulted in not any so far as I can remember direct collaboration with

166
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,519
physicians at San Francisco General which of course had ward 86 which was a major AIDS treatment

167
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,279
facility in the United States but people from ward 86 Paul Bulberding and Don Abrams came to the

168
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:49,519
institute to give seminars on some of their experience in treating AIDS patients and of course a

169
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,039
lot of AIDS patients in San Francisco were self-medicating with high dose vitamin C as well and the

170
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,480
physicians at San Francisco General had some anecdotal evidence that seemed to support some value

171
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:15,599
of vitamin C in this role. Rex seat was not offered a job by Oregon State University and I

172
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:24,799
believe he took a job with it's a research organization. He had some grants from Pacific Medical

173
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Center I believe in San Francisco that were sustaining his research activities and they think

174
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:37,839
they were transferred to California Pacific. I'd have to think about the name of the facility but

175
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:44,559
it's a medical research facility in San Jose and he took a job with them and then most recently I

176
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:52,319
believe he has joined Dr. Rath's research activity which is located in Santa Clara County or

177
00:20:52,319 --> 00:21:00,079
Santa Clara, California. So I think that's where he works currently. I'd love to have Constance

178
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,519
Chau. Constance Chau had been at the institute for a very long time she again I believe was there

179
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:12,720
when I joined in 1977. She was a chemist who had been hired to do a lot of work with vitamin C

180
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,319
and of course Linus Pond was very interested in biochemical attributes of vitamin C in the body and

181
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,759
there had been a lot of red flags about high dose vitamin C whether it could destroy vitamin B12

182
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:33,679
whether it would cause kidney stones excuse me kidney stones whether it would leach minerals or

183
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,559
amino acids from the body or interfere with amino acid metabolism. So there have been a number of

184
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:46,240
concerns about vitamin C for a long time and Connie Chau in collaboration with Linus Pond and she

185
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:54,240
had a small staff to help her as well was addressing a lot of these concerns about high dose vitamin C

186
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,240
and she was also doing a lot of she was directing a lot of work that was geared towards understanding

187
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,440
at some level some of the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C in other words if people take a certain

188
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,720
oral dose of vitamin C how much shows up in the urine and what is the result in blood concentration.

189
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:19,360
So she was doing studies like that and also trying to get at the role of vitamin C as an anti-cancer

190
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:29,120
agent. So in the 1980s as Linus Pond's ideas about the anti-cancer role of vitamin C developed I

191
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:37,200
mean initially it was post-resistance to vitamin C was the main anti-cancer theme for vitamin C

192
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,840
as hypothesized by you and Cameron and Linus Pond and then over time they started to develop some

193
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,880
new ideas which was to involve direct cytotoxicity of vitamin C or metabolites of vitamin C or degradation

194
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,559
products of vitamin C. So vitamin C would get when it gets ingested in the body can transform into

195
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:06,080
other chemical moieties that have different attributes and part of Connie Chau's research program was

196
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,839
to identify some of these breakdown products and metabolites of vitamin C and to find out whether

197
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,759
they had any anti-cancer effect in cell culture studies and in small animal studies and she was

198
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,319
quite successful in this and published a number of papers showing that degradation products of

199
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:29,039
vitamin C seemed to possess strong anti-cancer activity and she also did some work I believe

200
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:37,440
that was stimulated by reports from Japanese researchers Morshiga and Marata that

201
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,279
vitamin C combined with a copper tripeptide had very interesting anti-cancer effects and of course

202
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,680
the basis for that involves free radical chemistry so that's something that bit Connie Chau was

203
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,399
pursuing as well. She was at the institute until we closed our doors

204
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:06,240
in Palo Alto and then she effectively retired. I want to ask about if you're at Marata and if you can

205
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,920
once you get involved. They were non-resident fellows of the institute there had been a number

206
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:21,920
of non-resident fellows appointed over the years so far as I can recall they never carried out

207
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,279
any experimental work at the institute's facilities either in the mental park of Palo Alto

208
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,080
but they had longstanding and far-ranging discussions with Linus Pauling about the effect of

209
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,240
vitamin C in viral infection and cancer and in particular I think their earliest work had to do with

210
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:54,079
preventing transfusion associated viral hepatitis in hospital patients at their hospital in Japan

211
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,400
and they showed that by giving vitamin C to transfuse patients they were able to decrease the

212
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,400
incidence of transfusion associated hepatitis to almost negligible levels and of course that

213
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,440
intrigue Linus Pauling greatly and then they also developed an interest in vitamin C in cancer

214
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,799
which involved this copper tripeptide and carried out animal experiments, soul culture experiments

215
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:28,480
and even some surprisingly clinical work with copper tripeptide and high dose vitamin C typically

216
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,759
given intravenously and they published a number of papers and monographs.

217
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:44,799
Yeah, Morishega and Morata has remained close to the institute. He's been a supporter of the

218
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,480
institute for many years even since we moved here to Corvallis. Morishega, I'm not sure what's

219
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,359
become of him. I don't know what his current status is. I don't know if he's retired. If he has

220
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,599
a job someplace or if he's still writing and carrying out any work in that area but I know

221
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,960
in the late 80s and early 90s perhaps he did become increasingly interested in the beta-glucan

222
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,320
fraction of Mataki mushroom in particular but that glucan fraction is also present in other

223
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,160
mushroom varieties and I think he had done some work in soul culture and maybe animal experiments

224
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,360
to show that not only did it have immunostimulatory properties but seemed to have anti-cancer

225
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,640
properties as well and there's quite a big literature on that mushroom extracts and their

226
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,240
anti-cancer effect but as far as I can recall none of that took place at the Linus Pong Institute

227
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:52,160
it was solely focused on vitamin C at that time. They did they did they did yeah yeah and I think

228
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,040
that one or more of them maybe Morishega also spent some time with colleagues at Stanford University

229
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,279
at that time too but I can't really recall the details of those associations.

230
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:13,279
How about William A. Berth? William A. Berth had come to the institute from SRI which at that time

231
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:20,960
was known as Stanford Research. Stanford Research SRI industrial let me think.

232
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,000
Well anyway it had been originally affiliated with Stanford University and then I think

233
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,359
became an independent entity which is interestingly where I learned to do cell culture in the 1980s when

234
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,599
I set up our first cell culture facility at the facility in Memel Park. A. Berth was a physicist or

235
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:47,279
is a physicist who developed the Volcano Source Field Identization Mass Spectrometer that was used

236
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:56,000
in Pauling and Robinson's Metabolite Profiling Program so he was constantly developing that trying

237
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,359
to improve its parameters and improve the technology and that was his primary role at the institute.

238
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,200
He was also a really great ping pong player. We played ping pong quite often at noon and he invariably

239
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,680
beat me. So he designed instruments then? He did he designed instruments and worked on their

240
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,799
technical evolution and it was always a bit of a I won't say conflict but there's always some stress

241
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,720
there between instrument design and development and the biologists or biochemists who actually want

242
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,440
to use the instrumentation to gain data and then analyze data. And part of the problem with that

243
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:46,000
with that relationship is that the physicists always want to improve the technology. The biologists

244
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,039
want the technology to get to a certain acceptable level and then keep it constant and then run

245
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:00,720
lots of samples because if you keep changing the technology over time then the sample analysis

246
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,680
changes over time too and it makes it very difficult from a biological perspective to understand

247
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,639
what's going on with some of these things so it was interesting.

248
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:31,200
Well metabolic profiling I think what Robinson and Pauling and I can't claim to be an expert in this

249
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,639
area but I think what they were doing and what they had proposed at that time was really cutting

250
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:43,519
edge technology and cutting edge science and I believe that there's a lot of interest in that now

251
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:50,000
that may use slightly different technologies but nevertheless has the same goal of understanding

252
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,160
preventative medicine because the idea there was to try to detect very subtle biochemical changes

253
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,680
that would be reflected in body fluids such as saliva or typically urine was used because it's

254
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:12,000
easy to to use experimentally that might correlate with a predisposition to particular

255
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,960
pathological states like cancer and also to use it as a diagnostic tool so that you would for instance

256
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,480
take samples from hundreds of people diagnosed with a specific disease like muscular dystrophy

257
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,119
or multiple sclerosis or a particular type of cancer or even old people versus young people

258
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:41,839
or gender or something like that and then look for clues in the metabolic profile run through

259
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,720
this mass spectrometer that might correlate with that particular condition and for instance if you

260
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,320
found in a population of people with this particular type of cancer a representative or a set of

261
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,720
representative peaks on a mass spectrogram that correlated with that condition and you did not find

262
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,400
those peaks in normal healthy people then ostensibly you could use this to check someone's health

263
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:17,280
over time to see whether or not those substances represented by those peaks in the disease state

264
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,280
are starting to amplify in the healthy person's profile over time and if they are then you could

265
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,280
suppose that there are biochemical events taking place in that person that are leading to cancer

266
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,840
and if you had that knowledge very very early in the disease process the idea would be that you could

267
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,720
implement therapy much sooner and probably have a better therapeutic outcome so that kind of

268
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,160
thinking I think was was extraordinarily prescient and way way ahead of its time yeah memory series

269
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:57,200
it started with the specific brain work yeah yeah but the metabolic profile I mean they had at one

270
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,880
point I think under art Robinson's direction the idea was to build up a repository of urine samples

271
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,680
or blood samples from the inates collected through the VA hospital and other hospitals around

272
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:17,040
California and then these samples would be held at minus 80 degrees centigrade for decades and

273
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,000
then you would check on these people much later in life to find out what had happened to them

274
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,560
if they developed certain diseases and then go back and look at these samples to find out if

275
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,200
nor any clues or how these samples or how subsequent samples might have changed to give clues to

276
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,360
the progression of these particular diseases so I think it was a very very interesting program

277
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,319
that would eventually stop because of funding issues and there were some technical issues as well

278
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,640
for example the volcano source which is where the ionization of these volatile components took place

279
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:01,600
tended to erode and also material would would accumulate on this that could contaminate subsequent

280
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,880
sample analysis so there were some practical problems with how do you clean this cone between

281
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,560
samples and the life span of the cone and and other issues as well and some of those things are

282
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:20,400
what Bill Abarth and his people that took over that project after he left work on for years

283
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,520
how about Alan Sheets? Alan Sheets was at the institute when I arrived he was working in

284
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,639
biochemistry he was operating and developing gas chromatography and instrumentation

285
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:44,879
to do this kind of work the metabolite profiling work using not just human samples but with a focus

286
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:52,000
I think in the early days on rodent samples so analyzing rodent urine mouse urine typically using

287
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,400
gas chromatography so he was an expert in gas chromatography and worked very closely with

288
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:11,680
Bill Abarth as well as Art Robinson and then we developed a friendship and he I think we like

289
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,240
each other and he wanted me to get more involved in some of the work that he was doing in the laboratory

290
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,800
so Alan and I set up some experiments for you and Cameron to check and maybe I talked about this

291
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,920
before Cameron was very concerned about high dose vitamin C in people who are undergoing chemotherapy

292
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,440
because vitamin C can have general detoxifying capabilities and Cameron was concerned that

293
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,800
if chemotherapy is expected to be therapeutic for cancer patients then you don't want to

294
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,560
do anything to interfere with it and if high dose vitamin C interferes with specific chemotherapy

295
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,440
drug activity then you don't want to recommend it to people who are undergoing chemotherapy or perhaps

296
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
you want to alternate it with chemotherapy because chemotherapy is typically given in cycles

297
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:08,799
so to get at this question Alan and I set up a fishtoxicology experiment using fingering trout

298
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,719
and we reconstituted distilled water with there's a lot of literature in fishtoxicology and how to

299
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,200
make experimental aquariums per fish and so we followed that literature and we set up some

300
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,360
experiments to look at the combination of methotrexate and other chemotherapy drugs alone and

301
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:38,080
in combination with vitamin C on swimming behavior in the fish because when fish aren't feeling good

302
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,320
they stop swimming so there were ways to actually monitor the movement of the fish in the tanks

303
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,920
and that was one of the last experiments I did with Alan and then Alan was also very

304
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,120
he was very closely involved in the move because I think his father had worked as a mover,

305
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,480
had a moving company in Idaho so Alan was had experience in moving and we handled the move

306
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,519
ourselves from the mental park facility to the Page Mill Avenue facility in Palo Alto back in the winter

307
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:20,559
1980-1981 and Alan really took a major responsibility for that and coordinated that move and also

308
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,920
I think worked pretty closely with Emilio Zucicondo in design and setup of the new laboratory facility

309
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,280
at 440 Page Mill Road because we were moving into what had been essentially a battery factory

310
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,440
I believe and it needed to be reconfigured for for our work and I think Alan played an important role

311
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,559
in that as well and then eventually he retired he became I think less interested in biochemistry and

312
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:59,119
more interested in what would it be called physical therapy because his daughter had been born with

313
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,800
a genetic defect that caused muscle problems so she didn't have very graceful gate and Alan

314
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:15,120
became very interested in physical therapy that might help his daughter become sort of have a more

315
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,280
normal gate and more normal body actions so he eventually adopted that as a new career

316
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:32,800
what got done him was a retired physician who I think had spent most of his career in Tennessee

317
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,440
at the VA hospital memory service me and then had worked at Jackson Laboratory in Maine for quite a

318
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,360
long time I can't remember exactly why he came to the institute but this was in the I believe

319
00:37:47,360 --> 00:38:00,000
the early 1980s he came and set up a program to look at the effect of afflatoxin toxicity on

320
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,440
guinea pigs and whether that could they could be protected or rescued from afflatoxin toxicity

321
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:16,239
with vitamin C oh excuse me initially it was not afflatoxin it was beta amenopopryonitrile which

322
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:22,639
is a compound that exists in the grass pee which is a lagoon that people in India and other places

323
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:31,279
consume and it has the unfortunate characteristic of causing leg paralysis so when you consume

324
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:38,400
the grass pee products made from the grass pee over a long period of time you become very vulnerable

325
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,279
to irreversible leg paralysis so it affects the central nervous system and nervous tissue

326
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:51,679
so when you see a lot of the you know long long ago when you see these kind of archetypal photos

327
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,440
of beggars and calcutta and so forth and sometimes they'd be pulling themselves along on little

328
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,759
platforms with wheels with sticks and a lot of those people had succumbed to neural atherism and

329
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:10,239
of course when somebody develops neural atherism they can't work any longer and at least in India

330
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,679
in those days they were reduced to begging in the street for for money to to sustain themselves

331
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:19,599
so it was a big public health problem in some regions of the world because

332
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:28,079
the grass pee provided nutrition it's a lagoon so it had some nutritional value and it grows

333
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,440
like a weed so it doesn't really require any special agricultural practices it can grow and

334
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,440
drought or you know lots of water so it's something that's very available to people and they don't

335
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,039
know about the the downside of consuming this over a long period of time so what got done in

336
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:50,079
particular get very interested in whether or not vitamin C might inhibit the development of

337
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,119
neural atherism in people that are unavoidably exposed die terribly to this lagoon that contains

338
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,759
the neurotoxin so he set up a research program that involved guinea pigs because guinea pigs do not

339
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:09,279
synthesize vitamin C so you can control the amount of vitamin C in their bodies very carefully and

340
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,400
very easily and he would give these guinea pigs the toxin responsible for neural atherism and

341
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,920
they would develop hind leg paralysis very similar to what happens in people and men for some

342
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,000
reasons seem to be especially vulnerable to this and I don't know if that was checked in guinea pigs

343
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,040
because I think typically in those kinds of experiments you go for single gender you don't want

344
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,000
to house male and female guinea pigs together unless you're trying to breed guinea pigs so I don't

345
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,920
remember whether these were male guinea pigs or female guinea pigs but nevertheless they developed

346
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,920
hind leg paralysis when given this toxin however if you gave them the toxin and coadministered vitamin C

347
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:55,199
you could completely prevent paralysis or if there was paralysis it was transient so that that was

348
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:01,519
quite encouraging and also there are histopathological changes that can occur in the liver that did not

349
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,639
occur when the toxin was coadministered with vitamin C so vitamin C seemed to be protecting

350
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:12,079
their nervous system and liver is from pathological damage caused by exposure to this toxin

351
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,840
and I think what I've done him was very interested in taking this to the World Health Organization

352
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,639
and trying to get them to do human studies and find out whether this might be a low cost

353
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,559
remedy for this public health problem in regions of the world where people eat the grass

354
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:36,079
pee if you could allow them to continue eating the grass pee and give them low cost vitamin C supplements

355
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:40,960
with the advice that you know go ahead and eat this but be sure you take your vitamin C

356
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,239
then perhaps that would be less of a serious problem for those people

357
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,639
and then I think a little bit later he got interested in aflatoxin

358
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,400
and aflatoxin toxicity and guinea pigs and how that could be attenuated by coadministered

359
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,280
with vitamin C and he's back around the Institute. He did he stayed at the Institute for a very

360
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:11,680
long time retired in his wife we're very charming very very nice people and he retired probably in

361
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,840
I can't remember exactly when but towards the end of our 10 year there in palilato

362
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,680
John Levitt. John Levitt had been recruited from Johns Hopkins and may have known Rexie

363
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:32,559
Jarawal actually at Johns Hopkins. Levitt was recruited to direct our laboratory molecular

364
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:39,199
carcinogenesis which again was established by a meal with the idea of expanding the institute's

365
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:46,319
research into more molecular biological areas rather than strictly worth the molecular medicine

366
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:53,119
and John was very interested in again using this two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein profiling

367
00:42:53,199 --> 00:43:01,279
technology to understand fundamental differences between normal cells and cancer cells

368
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:09,599
in people and he discovered the mutant beta actin protein which seemed to be present in most

369
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,159
tumor cells that he looked at and maybe teen lymphocytes as well but never present in normal cells

370
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,679
so a lot of his work was geared toward understanding this mutant beta actin and also

371
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,920
he did some transgenic work and secured a patent with a colleague at Stanford that was commercialized

372
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,559
one of our rare successful commercializations of patents. I think Stanford actually led the

373
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,000
the commercialization effort there but nevertheless the institute benefited from royalties

374
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,480
from Levitt's invention there with a promoter of the mutant beta actin protein.

375
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:56,159
How about Jeffrey Bland? Jeffrey Bland was recruited to the institute back in the late 70s

376
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,920
from the University of Puget Sound where I think he had been a chemistry professor

377
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:08,559
and he joined the institute I think to work both on the Metabolite Profiling project but more

378
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:17,440
specifically to develop a new project which was called the Nutritional Supplement Analysis Laboratory

379
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:26,159
so the idea was to analyze nutritional supplements for their dissolution in the gastrointestinal

380
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:33,039
environment and also analyze them for purity and to find out if the label represented what

381
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:40,000
the actual ingredients were in nutritional supplements and the goal there was to

382
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:50,000
award some sort of certificate or seal kind of like the UL underwriters label or something

383
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,679
like that good housekeeping seal of approval two products that passed the stringent

384
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:06,960
qualifications and I think it was it was an interesting program and again way ahead of its time

385
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,159
I think it was so far ahead of its time that they had a very difficult time finding companies

386
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,879
that wanted to participate at that time they were selling their nutritional supplements very

387
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:22,159
happening and I guess didn't see the need for any kind of competitive advantage that might be

388
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,599
gained from this Linus Point Institute nutritional supplement analysis seal of approval

389
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,639
so eventually that program was disbanded

390
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:41,279
he moved on from there he also had a developing career as a public speaker and I think was very

391
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,560
interested in writing lecturing and set up some businesses in Washington as well

392
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,760
years of yorka years of yorka

393
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:04,560
did work there was primarily related to a meals interest in molecular evolution

394
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,000
I don't know specifically what year's these training was as a biologist or biochemist

395
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,199
I don't believe he was trained as a chemist but I don't know what his degree was in

396
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,679
but he had a very a very robust grant from the Department of Energy to analyze

397
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:29,119
allu sequences and the conservation of allu sequences in DNA and junk DNA over time

398
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,480
and he became after the institute's reorganization I think the assistant director of research

399
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,000
with the role ostensibly of helping Linus Point when Linus Point was absent or

400
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:51,519
providing input to Linus Point to make decisions about strategic decisions about research programs

401
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:58,559
at the institute and he was offered a job at Oregon State University but declined to come

402
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:05,279
north because I think his wife is a physician and had a very good practice in the San Jose area

403
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:13,119
they like living there and didn't want to come to Oregon I don't know if he was specifically

404
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,159
offered a position but clearly OSU was interested in recruiting him

405
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,920
Greg Spicer also was someone who was recruited by a meal to work in this area of molecular

406
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,119
evolution and Greg was working on

407
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,840
divergence of different invertebrate species using PCR which at that time was a fairly new technology

408
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,400
so Greg and I I would help him with some of this work go off in the Santa Cruz Mountains with

409
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:55,280
butterfly nets and collect different dragonflies and damselflies and other insects and then he

410
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,840
would run the DNA through the PCR and try to date the divergence of these different species

411
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:10,960
when the institute reorganized Greg was one of the new employees at IMMS so he continued to maintain

412
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,240
his lab and office in the building at 440 page mill road but then reported to a meal as part of IMMS

413
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:28,000
and after IMMS ended Greg took a position at San Francisco State in the department of biology

414
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
as a biology professor and I think he's still there I don't know if his time overlapped with

415
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,760
Krallin Krallin may have left may have retired before Greg got there but I'm sure they had friends

416
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,080
in common colleagues in common how would you do?

417
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,520
Kingdomic I did not know personally I saw him at various events and fundraisers and dinners

418
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,240
and so forth but I know that he was one of the three founders of the institute institute from

419
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,320
molecular medicine before it became known as the Linus Pauling Institute Science and Medicine

420
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,680
and dimic I believe was the the person who actually provided some of the funds to get the

421
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,079
institute off the ground in the early days there were grants transferred from Stanford but

422
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,679
there were also operational funds that were provided by Kingdomic and he had been instrumental

423
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:29,440
in a company that later I think was sold to variant maybe a gas chromatic chromatography

424
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,679
company or something like that I don't

425
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:41,599
this person named and I'm going to have another time announcing how he guessed it might be or

426
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,519
Alexander Alexander Nidswiki yes Alex was recruited

427
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,679
I believe to work with Jim Fleming in the aging program Sasagawa aging program initially

428
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,599
Jim was very interested in finding out the role of Hitchok proteins in longevity

429
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,599
life span in fruit flies primarily so he's doing a lot of work with fruit flies and also

430
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:14,480
producing transgenic fruit flies that overexpressed certain endogenous antioxidant enzymes

431
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,559
to try to find out if they would be more protected against toxic insult and how that would affect

432
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,960
their life span and things like that so Alex was working very closely with Jim

433
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:35,119
when Jim retired from the institute to go to Washington state to Spokane which is where he and his

434
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:43,920
family were from Alex started working with Matthias Rat who had then been recruited of course to

435
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,000
set up this cardiovascular disease laboratory at the institute so Alex began working closely with

436
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:02,239
Matthias Rat in carrying out that work she was one of the candidates that was being reviewed by

437
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:09,440
Oregon State University she didn't want to move from the Bay Area her husband was had a good job

438
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,559
in the Bay Area and you know as you find out many people who live in the Bay Area choose to live

439
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,760
there not just drawn there by their specific job but they like living there and I think

440
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:27,119
she was she certainly like living in the Bay Area and when the institute left she joined Dr.

441
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,400
Rat's research enterprise in Sanitarica and I believe she still works there

442
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:43,199
Fred Stitt who was someone who joined the institute in the 1980s he had worked with

443
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,560
Linus Pauling at Caltech I believe and it contributed to some extent on the publication of nature

444
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,920
of the chemical bond because I know he thanked and the acknowledgments of that book so I think he

445
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,560
had known Linus Pauling for a very long time I'm not quite sure what his role at Caltech was whether

446
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,560
he was there as a graduate student graduate fellow I don't believe he was on the faculty there but

447
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:13,759
Fred was a very very nice guy very intelligent perceptive person and he helped

448
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:25,279
organize some of the public responses for requests for information because by the mid 1980s we were

449
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:31,840
really being burdened by letters and phone calls requesting very specific information people

450
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:38,000
looking for all kinds of recommendations questions about whether they should take vitamin C or

451
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:47,200
high dose vitamin E and it had become not untenable because we felt that we were obligated to be

452
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,320
compassionate and as responsive as possible but Fred really helped organize responses to people so

453
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:00,559
he was trying to categorize some typical responses and then develop packets that could be sent to

454
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,000
people depending upon the nature of their question he did a very good job of that as well and also

455
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:13,759
responded personally to a lot of people and then he also became the newsletter editor so he worked

456
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:23,920
for at least several years editing the newsletter he would have worked closely with Cameron and

457
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,960
with Linus Pauline as well okay so the rest of the names that I have on my list are affiliates

458
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,880
rather than people who are actual employees and the first one of those is Martin Cayman. Martin

459
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,960
Cayman I never met Martin Cayman I know that he had a close relationship with Arthur Robinson

460
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,599
I don't really know much more about his involvement with the institute I believe he was on the

461
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:57,440
Board of Associates I remember correctly but I never had any interactions with him. Robert Cathcart

462
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:05,279
Robert Cathcart was a physician he died a few years ago he was what might be called an

463
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:12,079
orthomolecular physician who had gained some notoriety for developing the Cathcart prosthesis

464
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:23,279
many people who had had artificial hips implanted suffered because they didn't wear well prior

465
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:28,239
to Cathcart and Cathcart actually had the made the stunning observation that maybe we should actually

466
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:35,360
measure the actual relationship between the hip and the socket that the hip joint sits in and

467
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,079
from that he deduced that it was not perfectly spherical which is what most of the mechanical joints

468
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:46,079
were was more ellipsoidal so he came up with a new prosthesis that they had a much longer biological

469
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:54,719
life and he had I think he'd done some work at Stanford I don't know that he got his medical

470
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,239
degree at Stanford but he had been at Stanford in some capacity and then had a private practice

471
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:07,519
in incline village Nevada and had been treating people there he became very interested in Linus

472
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:14,880
Plung's work on vitamin C dating back to the 1960s and one issue that Cathcart became focused on

473
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,759
was how much vitamin C do you give to someone to have a therapeutic response and none of that was

474
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:26,639
known of course at the time and the transport mechanisms or the way vitamin C gets from the gastrointestinal

475
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:32,559
system into the bloodstream was not well known either people knew from simple experiments that if

476
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,199
you take a massive dose of vitamin C only a fraction of that gets into the bloodstream and then

477
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:43,360
a lot of it gets excreted and then a lot just passes through the gastrointestinal track and is

478
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:50,480
excreted but the reasons for all that were very vague and unclear people really didn't have much

479
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,320
clear idea of how vitamin C gets into the bloodstream so Cameron made the I mean Cathcart made the

480
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:02,719
observation that normal healthy people seem to be able to tolerate and it's quite variable but

481
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:10,080
can tolerate maybe a couple of grams or maybe up to five grams in a single large dose of vitamin C

482
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:20,000
before they get the laxative effect loose bowels and he observed that the same people when sick

483
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,680
could tolerate much much larger doses of vitamin C before that laxative effect was engaged

484
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,360
so he decided that that might be a good yardstick or guideline to use in the therapeutic application

485
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:44,240
of vitamin C so he recommended to his patients that take as much vitamin C as you can to reach

486
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:51,840
that bowel tolerance threshold effect of the laxative effect and then decrease slightly and continue

487
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:57,440
taking those doses of vitamin C until your symptoms are resolved and he used that pretty

488
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,120
successfully to treat people with flu and the common cold and other problems in his practice and

489
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:11,519
treated thousands of patients with that manner and he of course he became quite close to the

490
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:14,639
lines Pauline and I think they talked and visited each other quite often

491
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:25,199
well another very important person Erwin Stone Erwin Stone of course was about chemists who

492
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,960
had heard Pauline give a lecture in New York City about the merits of how Pauline wanted to live

493
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,519
a long time because somebody fascinating things were happening in the field of chemistry and he

494
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,880
really wanted to be around to get excited by all these developments in chemistry and the world

495
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:48,320
and I believe Stone followed up that with a letter to Pauline saying well there's no reason why

496
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:54,400
you should limit your expectations for a long life if you start taking vitamin C I think that you

497
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:02,960
could live another 50 years and in that letter and subsequent correspondence Stone laid out the rationale

498
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,720
for the belief that vitamin C might have value in promoting health span and lifespan and

499
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,119
decreasing the incidence of age related diseases like cancer or heart disease and

500
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:20,000
and be effective against infectious diseases and so forth so Stone had done a pretty good literature

501
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,440
review and he passed that along to Linus Pauline and Pauline became quite intrigued by this

502
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:34,159
correspondence with Stone and the literature that Stone referred to and he himself and his wife Ava

503
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:41,920
began taking a couple grams of vitamin C a day and made the observation that they were no longer

504
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:48,960
getting severe colds as often as they seem to get them previously so Pauline became I think convinced

505
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,159
that vitamin C had some value and of course this led to vitamin C in the common cold and Pauline's

506
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:59,920
own meta-analysis of the clinical literature and his own investigation of the literature on

507
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,000
vitamin C but I think Stone was really a catalyst for Pauline's specific interest in vitamin C.

508
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:15,119
I did meet Erwin Stone a few times he lived in San Jose had some kind of small institute in San

509
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:21,119
Jose that I think eventually was wrapped up with some help from from Rick Hicks and other people at

510
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:27,920
the institute and he came he came to see Linus Pauline periodically and I did see him at dinners

511
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,480
and so forth. Do you know where there's no interest in vitamin C in this regard?

512
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,480
The story I believe is that in a car accident he was left frail to deal with cells with vitamin C.

513
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,880
I think that's right I think that's exactly right. Yeah I think that's right but I don't

514
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,280
know why he considered vitamin C at that time. Maybe because you know if you have wounds you need

515
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,039
optimum collagen synthesis and vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis or you get scurvy so maybe

516
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,000
he just put two and two together and decided that you know for optimum healing of his wounds

517
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:12,720
both bone damage and tissue damage that vitamin C would be really important but I don't know

518
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,080
that for sure. I know that another fellow who reared in who was a long time friend of Linus Paulines

519
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:24,960
and very important figure in the field of orthomolecular medicine and some of the societies that grew

520
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,960
up around this concept of orthomolecular medicine. He was a psychiatrist by training and became very

521
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,040
interested in vitamin C in cancer and did a lot of clinical work in Wichita, Kansas and had a

522
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,440
whole center devoted to the development of high dose vitamin C oral and intravenous as a

523
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,599
junk to therapy for cancer. He told me that he initially became interested in vitamin C I believe

524
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:54,720
as a medical student when he had a poisonous spider bite and decided he had some irritation and some

525
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,760
symptoms from the spider bite and decided to just treat it with high dose vitamin C and then he

526
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:07,360
measured vitamin C content in his own urine and even after massive oral doses vitamin C content

527
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:17,840
blood I believe was extremely low so he deduced that that the vitamin C was detoxifying the spider

528
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:24,000
venom and all the sequelae from the spider bite you know inflammatory molecules and things like that

529
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,680
so he became convinced from his own experience again that vitamin C had some therapeutic value that

530
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:40,080
had really not been recognized by conventional physicians no he was not as a matter of fact I'm

531
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:46,960
not sure that he was even a PhD I'm not sure that he had an earned PhD it might have been an honorary

532
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:59,599
PhD but I have to check. How about Armani Hammer? Armani Hammer again was a retired physician who

533
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:07,519
had found lots of success in the business world I think one of his earliest jobs was something like

534
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,320
I remember correctly I hope I'm not confusing him with the other

535
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:24,880
philanthropist in New York Sackler I believe was Armani Hammer who sold pencils to Russia during

536
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:33,600
Lenin's rule made made a lot of money that way it seems like an odd way to make money but he

537
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,120
I'm not quite sure why he and Lenin's poem became friends but he won the or was awarded the

538
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,960
Linus Ponging Minitarian Award at one point and he came to visit Pauling at the institute a

539
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:53,679
number of times and I believe Pauling visited him in Southern California in a number of times that

540
01:02:53,679 --> 01:03:01,119
probably at Banquets or honorary dinners and things like that so I met him and saw him a few times

541
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:10,559
but one time in the 1970s Rick Hicks had a document that needed to be signed by Armani Hammer that day

542
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:19,679
so I took a flight from San Jose to Los Angeles in the morning got a cab to Occidental Petroleum

543
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,639
which was headquartered in Westwood went up to see Armani Hammer chatter with him for a few

544
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:30,079
minutes got his signature brought the document back had I had something to eat in Westwood very

545
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:36,159
briefly got a cab back to LAX and flew back to San Jose and returned with a document right in time

546
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,400
Pauling had a relationship with Sackler too right yeah Sackler of course was another physician who

547
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:54,559
had found a lot of success in the business world and he in particular became the publisher of

548
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:00,480
Medical Tribune I think Sackler was very intrigued by Pauling's ideas in North molecular medicine

549
01:04:01,759 --> 01:04:10,239
and gave Pauling quite a lot of space to write letters and articles in Medical Tribune and

550
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
really was I think he also won the Linus Pong Award for humanitarianism if my memory served me right

551
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,559
and he was at some of these dinners and bankwits and Pauling birthday parties and so forth

552
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:28,719
and I think Arthur Sackler once expressed Pauling the desire to help the institute in a very

553
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:34,960
substantial way but unfortunately he died before he was able to put those plans in place or

554
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:44,079
take any specific action Frederick Clinton was someone I never met I'm not sure that Linus

555
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,199
Pauling ever met him either but his work had been published in regional medical journals

556
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:54,559
in the southeast United States going back a blue to the 1940s and 50s and

557
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:01,199
Clinton had I think on his own started to work with very high dose vitamin C typically given

558
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:09,920
intravenously to treat all kinds of maladies including poisonous snake bites spider bites

559
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:15,600
insect bites things like that and Clinton had become convinced that this had great value

560
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,440
and the therapeutic response was very dramatic in many cases and he'd written lots of articles

561
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,840
for these regional medical journals and I think Pauling was very intrigued by his clinical work

562
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:34,000
and the anecdotes that Cleaner had about the utility of high dose vitamin C and treating different

563
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:46,320
conditions and diseases. Arthur Churkin was a PhD who had some position at the

564
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:53,920
VA hospital in Los Angeles and had worked somewhat closely with Art Robinson and Linus Pauling

565
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,559
perhaps in the metabolite profiling program obtaining samples or something like that

566
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,000
excuse me and he was on the Board of Trustees and I think served as the secretary of the Board

567
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:15,680
of Trustees for many years but I only saw him rarely. Norman Cousins was publisher of what was

568
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:29,200
it Saturday? Saturday review. It was a major American periodical who had been diagnosed with

569
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:36,720
maybe ankle mostings ankle, ankle lighting and spawned a load. I can't remember the name of the

570
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,840
term now but it was a nervous condition or a nerve tissue condition I believe that was sometimes

571
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:50,960
fatal and Norman Cousins became interested in Pauling's work and thought that vitamin C might

572
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:59,280
have some value so he embarked on a self-styled therapeutic regiment that included lots of laughter so

573
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,720
I think he watched a lot of old movies and TV shows that provided a lot of laughter and also

574
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,600
took very high dose vitamin C and seemed to recover very well from his illness so he in line

575
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:24,079
as Pauling became good friends. I didn't know that but it wouldn't surprise me.

576
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,639
Bruce Ames is someone who Pauling I think knew from Caltech when Ames was a graduate student there

577
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,799
Bruce Ames was friendly with his family and Peter Pauling and Linda Pauling and I'm sure had some

578
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:54,880
interactions with Linus Pauling back in those days too. Bruce became a professor of a professor in

579
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,679
the University of California Berkeley where he spent most of his career on the National Medal of

580
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,799
Science and developed very importantly something called the it's actually called the Salmonella

581
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:11,120
mutagenicity test but everybody calls it the Ames test and it's a way of using mutant bacteria

582
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,400
to determine the mutagenicity of certain compounds that might be present in the environment

583
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:22,079
or in the diet and also the anti-mutagenic effect of certain protective compounds or punitive

584
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:29,440
protective compounds so he's he's very highly regarded in the scientific world and he also recently

585
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:38,320
well he did work back in the 1980s on antioxidants and in particular in 1989 I believe 87 or 89

586
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:44,240
published a paper of Balte's Fry is now the director of the Linus Pi Institute showing that a

587
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:50,080
scorebait is an outstanding antioxidant in human blood so the body is full of different types of

588
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,520
antioxidants. Some are taken from our diet like vitamin C and vitamin E and some are synthesized

589
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:02,560
in cells in the body and provide endogenous antioxidant protection. Uric acid is another antioxidant

590
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,840
that can be produced in the body from dietary factors that are taken in and Balte's Fry and

591
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:14,880
Bruce Ames tried to evaluate the importance of these different antioxidants and rank them

592
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,760
and it turned out that vitamin C was by far and away the most powerful antioxidant in human blood

593
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:28,239
so that work of course appealed to Linus Pi and Bruce and Balte were invited to come to the

594
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:33,840
institute back in California it was the day of the Big Earthquake in 1989 and give back to back

595
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:40,320
seminars on this latest finding about vitamin C and the importance of its antioxidant

596
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:51,599
capacity in blood and Bruce has been very interested in the free radical theory of aging

597
01:09:51,599 --> 01:10:00,639
and oxidative damage that might lead one to increase susceptibility to cancer for instance so

598
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:06,880
Bruce compares the free radicals that were thrown off by normal respiration and mitochondrial

599
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:14,640
activity to hits from cosmic radiation so these can very definitely damage effect and damage DNA

600
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,920
that could make you vulnerable to developing cancer so we've been very interested in that and how

601
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,440
to protect against that which includes things like antioxidants and vitamin C and then more

602
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,520
recently he's developed a triage theory and it's kind of extended Pauling's ideas in orthomolecular

603
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:37,040
medicine where in Pauling's original paper he talked about a couple of genetic diseases that

604
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:44,480
result in people's inability to metabolize certain dietary compounds and so forth and Bruce has

605
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:53,040
extended this to maybe 30 or more genetic diseases that can be remedied by high dose vitamin therapy

606
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:58,880
including some of the B vitamins so it's kind of a logical extension of Pauling's early ideas

607
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:11,119
in orthomolecular medicine in 2001 when we organized and convened our first diet and optimum

608
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:16,319
health conference Bruce was the first recipient of the Linus Pauling Institute Prize for Health

609
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,760
Research that acknowledged his pivotal and seminal work in orthomolecular medicine and worked

610
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,800
that you know resonates with the mission of the Linus Pauling Institute and Bruce also has been on

611
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:34,880
extramural scientific advisory board of the institute since Boltz Fry was recruited so he's

612
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,560
had a lot of really terrific critical feedback on the development of the institute and I think it

613
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,239
it could even be one of his early ideas that led to the specific development of our micronutrient

614
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:57,840
information center. Lester Packer is also a retired professor from UC Berkeley who has written

615
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:06,159
many many papers and also many books including some popular books on what he calls the antioxidant

616
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:11,920
network and Lester has been very interested in some of the more obscure antioxidants I mean he's

617
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:17,279
always been interested very much in in vitamin E in particular Marrett Traber who's one of our

618
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:24,239
principal investigators worked in Dr. Packer's lab at UC Berkeley much like Boltz Fry worked in

619
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:29,440
Bruce Haynes laboratory at UC Berkeley so they're all and also Tori Hagen who directs our

620
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,000
healthy aging program was working in Bruce Haynes laboratory at UC Berkeley so we have alumni

621
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,239
from the Ames and Packer labs Emily Ho who is one of our principal investigators also worked in the

622
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:48,159
games lab. So Lester is very interested in this concept of antioxidant network which refers to

623
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:55,679
the complex interplay between the endogenous and exogenous antioxidants in the body and how they

624
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:02,079
can collaborate and cooperate to protect us from oxidative damage so he's interested in things

625
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:09,279
like vitamin E, lapolic acid, some of the carotenoid, vitamin C, superoxid, dysmetase,

626
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:15,920
catalysts and all these other antioxidants and he's he's he's got terrific organizing skills as

627
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:22,319
well and I believe he probably played a role he may be one of the founders of the Oxygen Club

628
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:27,679
of California which holds annual meetings in California all organized to end this theme of

629
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:34,000
free radical chemistry and the effects of free radicals and antioxidants on human health and

630
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:41,920
disease. There is a very close relationship because many of our principal investigators have been

631
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,520
members of the Oxygen Club for a long time and we co-sponsor each other's conferences and there's

632
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:54,079
quite a lot of collaboration between the Oxygen Club of California and LPI and most recently as kind

633
01:13:54,079 --> 01:14:01,920
of a manifestation of that close relationship the Oxygen Club of California donated a very nice

634
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:07,520
bronze sculpture from Christine Cunningham to the Linus Point Institute which is housed in our lobby

635
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,480
in the Linus Point Science Center.

636
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,319
So the last person on that list is Mark Levine.

637
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:23,359
Mark Levine is a physician, clinical physician and medical researcher at the National Institutes

638
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:30,560
of Health and he's had a longstanding interest in vitamin C and therapeutic application of vitamin C.

639
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:39,200
He was among the scientists at the NCI and the NIH that convened a meeting that was written

640
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:44,960
up in the pages of science as vitamin C gets a little respect and Linus Point of course participated

641
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,400
in that meeting, Gladys Block. He became a trustee of the Linus Point Institute of Science and Medicine.

642
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,880
Balsray was there, Lester Packer was there I believe.

643
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:59,680
And Jeroel and Connie Chameh attended that as well but it was a meeting organized at the NCI

644
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,600
to talk about the role of vitamin C in cancer and health and disease.

645
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:16,240
And Mark has carried out in recent years, well actually beginning in the mid 1990s, very

646
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:22,560
elegant, carefully controlled pharmacokinetic studies on vitamin C because he's always been

647
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,119
interested in how what happens to vitamin C once you take it, where does it go, how much

648
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:32,000
actually gets into the bloodstream, how does it get into the bloodstream. So he carried out some

649
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,279
very interesting pharmacokinetic studies that helped inform the food nutrition boards

650
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,720
change in 2000 of the RDAs for vitamin C. And he showed for instance that

651
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:50,960
oral vitamin C you can take as much as you want but you rarely can get above for the average person

652
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,720
about 200 micromole per liter concentration of vitamin C in the blood because the amount of

653
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:01,440
vitamin C that gets into the bloodstream is limited. And he didn't make these discoveries but

654
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,920
about a dozen years or so ago discoveries were made about the transport mechanisms,

655
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,520
these molecules that transport vitamin C across cells, they're on the cell surface and they

656
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,680
determine how much vitamin C gets into the cell. So the cells that line the epithelia around the

657
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:25,360
intestines have these transport mechanisms on them and they determine how much vitamin C gets

658
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:30,479
into the bloodstream from the intestine. And it's limited, it just doesn't diffuse through,

659
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,319
you know, you have a higher concentration here and a low concentration there. You might say,

660
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:38,639
well, it's just a diffusion gradient phenomenon where it diffuses from the high concentration

661
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:42,239
and the low concentration try to get equilibrium. It doesn't really work quite like that.

662
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:49,759
It may, it very, very high doses that may come into play but primarily it's controlled by these

663
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:56,960
mechanisms. And after Mark's pharmacokinetic studies with both oral vitamin C and intravenous

664
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:03,760
vitamin C, it dawned on him that, wow, maybe that explains why the male clinic studies failed

665
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,720
to show any benefit for high dose vitamin C because they gave vitamin C only orally whereas

666
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,560
Cameron typically gave vitamin C intravenously and orally. And when you give it intravenously you

667
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,840
bypass these control mechanisms on cells and you can get very, very high concentrations in the

668
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,440
blood that depending on the dose can be 70 or 100 times greater, millimole concentrations of

669
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:33,760
vitamin C in the blood that are unobtainable by oral vitamin C. And Mark has since gone on to

670
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,360
show in a series of really great experiments, cell culture experiments and small animal experiments

671
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:46,160
that these very high concentrations of vitamin C generate hydrogen peroxide in the milieu

672
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:53,519
around tumor cells. And then the hydrogen peroxide can presumably diffuse into the tumor cells

673
01:17:53,519 --> 01:18:00,239
and cause their death by different mechanisms, including interfering with mitochondrial machinery

674
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:08,399
and causing atop poses, apoptosis, sorry. So where does this line of research just want to

675
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:17,520
do you do your trials? Yeah, the line of research is so engaging and now that we have a better

676
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:24,880
mechanistic understanding of vitamin C in cancer and we have a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics

677
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,200
this is led to a number of preliminary clinical trials phase one clinical trials and be followed

678
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:35,680
up by other clinical trials. I'm sure that we'll get at these issues of safety, combination with

679
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:40,960
other standard drug therapy because there's some evidence that some of the arsenic compounds that

680
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:47,920
are used chemotherapeutically are potentiated by vitamin C which also tends to decrease the side

681
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:56,159
effects of the arsenic trioxide compounds. So lots of questions remain, optimum dose of vitamin C,

682
01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:01,920
the frequency of vitamin C, slow drip infusion versus periodic injection a few times a week.

683
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:09,520
All those questions really need to be answered and those issues need to be characterized much

684
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:16,560
more carefully and we really don't at this point have any predictive ability so we don't know which

685
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,359
people would which cancer patients are going to benefit most from high dose vitamin C.

686
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,800
Clearly it's not a panacea for all cases of terminal cancer and there are many people that

687
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:32,320
have not benefited from high dose IV vitamin C and that needs to be understood as well.

688
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:38,720
And interestingly this all harps back to work that Pauline published with Japanese researchers

689
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:46,640
back in the 80s showing that vitamin C can generate hydrogen peroxide and cell culture experiments

690
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,560
and that this is what's killing tumor cells. So back in the 1980s as I said earlier that's when

691
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,560
Pauline's attention started to focus more on the cytotoxicity of vitamin C and degradation

692
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:05,600
products of vitamin C direct effects against cancer cells as opposed to humoral effects with host

693
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:12,080
resistance. So I think it's very promising a lot needs to be learned. The patient population in

694
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:18,160
Scotland may be quite different from the contemporary patient population in the United States and

695
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,800
you know all these it's very very complex and there are a lot of issues that need to be

696
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,359
really analyzed and thought about very carefully but I think the upshot is that

697
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,359
many complementary so-called complementary physicians are now using high dose IV vitamin C

698
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:39,920
as a junked of cancer therapy but we don't yet have good data acquisition and analysis

699
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,639
of all those anecdotal reports and I think you know people are interested in getting that information.

700
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:51,600
Well so there might be some validation after Pauline's attention for 35-40 years later.

701
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,440
I think there will be validation for Pauline and Kermann and interestingly enough

702
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,720
if you if you look carefully in some of Pauline's writings particularly

703
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,360
after the male clinic trials I mean he and Kermann and others came up with

704
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,840
criticisms of the male clinic methodology and there were lots of criticisms that were

705
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,880
fine criticisms. The fact that the patients have undergone parochymotherapy in the first trial

706
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,520
or vitamin C was suspended in the second trial and then patients started to die when the

707
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:27,119
vitamin C was stopped abruptly and there seemed to be fairly high concentrations of vitamin C in the

708
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:34,400
urine of some of the placebo patients which makes people doubt that they were true placebo patients.

709
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:43,600
So they had a lot of criticism about the methodology but at least Pauline and I believe Kermann

710
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,880
also noted in print that there was a big difference between the mode of administration

711
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,760
and although they didn't have evidence at the time to suggest that

712
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,480
IV vitamin C was definitely more effective Pauline

713
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,880
speculated that this may have some importance so I think he was very insightful there as well.

714
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,240
Well

715
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,160
yeah I'd have to finish unpacking my office and look at some of the early

716
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,760
employment rosters to see if there were there people there. I mean I knew a lot of people

717
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,200
over a long period of time and I think we've touched on most of the principles but clearly there

718
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:47,200
were a lot of other people that worked there because there were I mean you know there were 75 or

719
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:53,200
80 people working at the institute at different times so ed blazedel is another one who worked

720
01:22:53,279 --> 01:23:00,159
with a lot of data analysis Steve Burbek is another person who maybe I should talk about this

721
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:06,239
for just a moment I don't know if Steve Burbek was on your list there. Steve Burbek was I think had

722
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:12,720
research experience in audiology or psychology and hearing or something like that but also had

723
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:20,079
strong background in computer science when we were developing this program of protein profiling

724
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:27,279
and just to give you a brief introduction to that if you're interested in finding out what

725
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:33,519
differences in gene activity or proteins might be between one type of cell and another say a normal

726
01:23:33,519 --> 01:23:40,000
cell in a cancer cell you need some way to to quantify or visualize those proteins and one

727
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,119
way of doing that is to have different cell populations that you're growing in petri dishes

728
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:52,479
and say for sake of example you have a population of normal cells in one petri dish and a

729
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:57,359
population of those normal cells that have been treated with something to make them tumorogenic

730
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:03,920
in a different dish then you can incubate those cells with something like S35 methionine which

731
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:11,119
is a radioactive isotope of sulfur combined with methionine which is an amino acid that gets incorporated

732
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:17,519
into proteins so as these cells in the dish are making new proteins and growing they're

733
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:22,079
incorporating this radioactive methionine because you're growing them in a normal methionine deficient

734
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:27,680
medium and you replace the normal methionine with this radioactive methionine so now all the proteins

735
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:34,159
that incorporate methionine in these cells now become radioactive so at the end of a certain

736
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,439
period of time you can drain the fluid from these cells you can collect all the cells you can

737
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,120
rupture them which is called cell lysis and then you end up with a little radioactive cell lysate

738
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:49,360
and you can separate the proteins in that cell lysate and has to be treated in certain ways

739
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,920
in these porous polyacrylamide gels on the basis of their

740
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:04,160
isoelectric point which is related to a pH gradient and also on the basis of the molecular weight

741
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,240
so you do a two-dimensional separation of these proteins under the influence of an electric

742
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:17,920
field and you end up with a rectangular gel about half the size of a piece of stationary paper

743
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:24,079
and that gel can be dried onto a piece of filter paper so now you've got this gel that contains

744
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:28,800
all these radioactive proteins dried onto a piece of filter paper you can put that up against

745
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:36,079
a piece of film and put it in a film cassette in the dark for x number of hours or days then you

746
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:40,319
take the film out and you develop it in the film processor and if you look at the film you'll see

747
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,079
hundreds or thousands of little spots that correspond to a radioactive emission from the

748
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:52,399
methining residue on the proteins so then you can the question is well how do you quantify that

749
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:57,279
so you've got all these spots of varying intensity and size all over this piece of film

750
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,920
so part of Steve Burbeck's program at the institute Jerry Ladder participated in this

751
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:10,640
and other people participated in it as well was to develop hardware and software that would

752
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:18,319
help us and now analyze these films and come up with quantitative information so we bought for

753
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:23,600
instance a drum scanner and a drum scanner is simply a device on which you can mount one of these

754
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:29,520
films and then it spins around really fast and it digitizes these spots so now you've got

755
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,920
information in the computer about the position and intensity and size of these spots and you

756
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:42,480
can use that to create a pseudo image on a computer screen that corresponds to the you know the

757
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,360
position of all these images in the computer screen correspond to the spots that you saw in the

758
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:54,160
x-ray film exactly the same only now they can be color coded for intensity and Steve Burbeck and

759
01:26:54,159 --> 01:27:02,960
Jerry Ladder and others develop software programs that allowed us to to analyze these images very

760
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:09,279
carefully and come up with quantitative information so we could find out whether certain proteins were

761
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:15,199
decreasing in synthesis or increasing in synthesis in these tumor cells or whether new proteins were

762
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:19,760
being synthesized or whether certain proteins being synthesized in the normal cells were suddenly

763
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:26,000
disappearing in the tumor cells and to do that kind of analysis in a quantitative way is really

764
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,720
complicated and Steve Burbeck and Jerry Ladder and others worked on for years on a program to help

765
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:38,159
us analyze those gels that developed all kinds of really sophisticated algorithms to help us

766
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:43,920
understand and match so we had a semi-automated system that would allow us to match spots

767
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:51,119
from one gel to another so if you have an image for the normal cell proteins and then an image

768
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,560
side by side on the computer screen from the tumor cell proteins you want to be able to match

769
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:03,520
one protein from one image to the same protein and the other image and to do that you need very

770
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,279
sophisticated software so they spend quite a number of years developing software to help us in

771
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:13,840
that kind of analysis so it was a big program actually at the institute

772
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:18,479
not offhand
