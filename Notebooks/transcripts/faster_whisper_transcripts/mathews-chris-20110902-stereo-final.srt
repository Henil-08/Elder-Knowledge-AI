1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,640
So if you would just start by introducing yourself, just let us know your name and the date

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,839
date and where we got, I know.

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,839
Okay.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:15,839
I'm Christopher Matthews.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:24,480
Today is September 2nd, 2011, and we're in the Valley Memorial Library.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Okay.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,960
So, just know where you were born and what you were up.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Okay.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,120
I was born in 1937 in New York City, and my father was about to start a medical practice

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,400
in the Grinchport, Connecticut, so we moved from New York very early.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,920
He was stationed with the Navy during the war on a variety of places, and moved to Seattle

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,439
in 1944, and the family moved with him.

13
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,759
After the war, my family moved back to Connecticut again, but after three years they realized

14
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,039
they'd made a big mistake leaving the West Coast, so we moved to Olympia in 1949, and

15
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:06,519
that's what I consider my hometown.

16
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,120
What was some of your hobbies when you were growing up?

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,400
Well, I was pretty interested in science, obviously.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,959
I had a chemistry set, and my friends and I used to make rockets and fire them off.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:28,520
And I became interested in birding a nature study because my grandfather was a professional

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,040
ornithologist who was cured of birds at the American Museum of Natural History in New

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:42,520
York, so we had, we were very much exposed to natural history all my life, and that's

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
kept on.

23
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:50,119
What was the president of the Audubon Society of Corvallis for three years?

24
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:59,119
So there was a strong family influence in the science, and I'm trying to understand where

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
that early interest in science came from, right?

26
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,799
Right.

27
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,240
Well, my grandfather of course was an ornithologist, and a very broadly based biologist.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,800
My father was a physician, and his father was a surgeon, so there wasn't, well, let's

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,719
say there was both medical and scientific achievement in our background, and people

30
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,520
who are just natural, I guess, for me to have a career in science, although I did consider

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,040
medicine pretty strongly at various times.

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
My mother?

33
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:44,359
She has a degree from Vassar in English and actually dramatic production, and she never

34
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:50,479
got involved in science, but she obviously encouraged what my brother and my sisters, and

35
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,719
I did.

36
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:58,199
My brother ended up as a wildlife biologist and retired a few years ago from the University

37
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,680
of Washington faculty in the College of Fisheries.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,920
My sisters are all younger, and they, two of them finished college, but they finished

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,480
in their thirties.

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,480
My parents went through a fairly messy divorce when my sisters were teenagers, and I think

41
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,520
this kept them from being motivated to go through college, but they were all very bright

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,960
and they went back.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,560
At a cheap quite a lot, actually, my youngest sister, among other things, has published

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,960
three books, one of which was described her experience as the winner of the Pillsbury

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,040
Bake Off in 1998, with a $1 million prize.

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
It's a very readable book.

47
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,039
Very interesting.

48
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:57,039
So outside of your family, were there other scientific mentors or influences in your life

49
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,039
as a child?

50
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:09,120
I guess so, I hadn't thought very much about that, but not so much toward the hard science.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,600
In fact, the chemistry course that I took in high school is probably my least favorite

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,560
course, although the teacher, Mr. Gaines, was my merit badge counselor when I got the chemistry

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,600
merit badge in Boy Scout.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,840
This is my freshman year in high school, and he told me I shouldn't try for it, so I was

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,400
a junior and had taken chemistry, and he helped me through it.

56
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:45,000
But he wasn't a very good teacher, and the botany teacher, Mr. Burke, also, and the physics

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,759
teacher, Mr. Keller, none of them I thought were particularly good teachers, but there was

58
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,800
enough interest in what I was doing, and that I guess that provided some motivation.

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,120
So scouting was something you were involved in?

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Yes.

61
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,519
When we moved to Olympia, we lived in the right in town, actually, about two blocks from

62
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,399
the state capital building, and it was very easy to be in Boy Scouts, and my parents bought

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,000
some waterfront land about seven miles out of town, and we moved there to a house that

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,640
they built in my freshman year, and it became much more difficult to be involved in scouting

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
after that.

66
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,360
So, although I always wanted to be an ego scout, I just drifted out of it.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,480
How would you characterize the rest of your high school experience?

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,760
That's an interesting question, too.

69
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,579
I had to skip the second grade, so I was younger and smaller than most of my classmates, and

70
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:55,680
it took me a while to catch up socially, but I worked pretty hard at it, and ended up

71
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,279
with a very nice group of friends.

72
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:05,120
I thought that educationally the high school experience was pretty mediocre, but maybe

73
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,839
I was too hard on it.

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,600
I worked pretty hard, and obviously did pretty well.

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,280
My daughter managed to make it through Corvallis High in three years, and when I thought back

76
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
on my high school experience, maybe that would have been good, but then I would have been

77
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,040
two years ahead, and the catching up socially would have been that much more difficult.

78
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Any sports in the end?

79
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,040
I've never been very athletic, but I've enjoyed doing things, I've skied across country

80
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:49,280
skied, and I jog regularly, and you wouldn't call that athletics, but it's keeping in shape.

81
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,520
Played a little tennis, but it never was very good as much of anything in a way of sports.

82
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:02,759
Okay, so after high school, you went to Reed College, how did you decide to go to Reed?

83
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,639
Well, I was reading an article on the Saturday evening post in 1952, my junior year in high

84
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,039
school, and there was an article by Richard Newberger, who later became a senator from Oregon,

85
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,199
and the title of the article was The School for Bright Young Things, and I guess that's

86
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,639
sort of what I perceived myself as, and I'd never heard of Reed College before, even though

87
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,639
we lived just 120 miles away from Portland, and it looked like a pretty exciting place,

88
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,480
and it seemed as though it would be bright for me, and so I applied to Reed, and I applied

89
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,719
to Stanford, and of course, it was accepted both places, and Reed just seemed much more

90
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,720
convenient, and it was more affordable, quite a distinction between the two alternatives,

91
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
because our son eventually went to Stanford, so I learned a lot more about it.

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah, actually three of us from my graduating class went to Reed, and one of them only

93
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,960
made it two years, the other one who'd been a very strong science student ended up majoring

94
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,320
in philosophy and going to law school, and also becoming an extremely accomplished folk

95
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,000
musician here and his wife basically made their living, so Reed was interesting in terms

96
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,879
of the fact that a lot of people went there moving in one direction and changed directions

97
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:49,320
completely, or undirected and getting a direction. There was also a very high attrition rate

98
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,720
then, so there were a number of students that went there undirected, and there wasn't much

99
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,799
supervision, and so a number of students had dropped out, and I was one of the ones who

100
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,399
had sort of a vague idea of what I wanted to do, and basically stayed with it.

101
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,879
What was the climate like in the day?

102
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,879
I suppose pretty much like it is today, it was pretty intense intellectually, but the

103
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:24,559
students knew how to have a good time as well. The academic environment was very strong.

104
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:33,319
The courses in liberal arts and social science all had a very heavy writing component, so

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,320
in the freshman humanities course we had to write a paper every week, and then we had

106
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:45,000
an individual conference about every paper with the instructor, so anything credit I can

107
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,080
take for my ability to write today, I owe to Reed College, and the science was very strong

108
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,080
also. At that time in the early mid-50s I would say that the science wasn't as strong

109
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,080
as it is currently. Reed, like many of the other high-quality undergraduate colleges,

110
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,080
has really made a push for a stronger research orientation in the science faculty, and although

111
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,080
we were all required to write a thesis when I was a student, I would say the thesis worked

112
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,360
all cutting-edge science, but put it that way. In fact, one of my regrets about Reed

113
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,360
was that I probably took more science than I really needed to, and I should have taken

114
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:43,360
more courses in liberal arts philosophy and the literature and social sciences than I did,

115
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,360
but I ended up with the interest in a lot of different areas and can learn a lot of things

116
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,360
through my own reading, and that's what College is supposed to be for anyway, I think.

117
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,360
How would you say you're a scientific interest developer than the graduate?

118
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Well, I went there as a chemistry major because of my interest that started with the

119
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,360
weeding about chemistry and playing with chemistry sets and so forth, so it was sort of an

120
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:24,360
unfocused interest, but at some point I read a science fiction anthology of short stories,

121
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:35,360
and the stories were grouped by scientific area that the science fiction dealt with, and so

122
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,360
there were two or three stories that were listed under biochemistry. I never heard of biochemistry

123
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,360
before, and I thought, hey, the idea of chemistry that has something to do with biology,

124
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm going to have to read these stories and I enjoyed them, and so my junior year,

125
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,360
I took a biochemistry course, and the reading I did, both in class and auto class,

126
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,360
convinced me that this was a pretty exciting area to go into. During my sophomore year,

127
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:12,360
I'd wrestled with the idea of going to medical school. I had a hard time with organic chemistry,

128
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:21,360
the first term of it, and the fall term of my sophomore year, and I'd like to tell medical

129
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,360
students or pre-medical students this story. I began to wonder if I was bright enough to go into

130
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,360
science and maybe I should go into medicine instead, but then the second semester of the

131
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,360
main course for majors was quantitative analysis. I did much better, and at the end of the

132
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,360
year I decided I was bright enough to go into science after all.

133
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Was it headway or reading, or maybe when you're in high school, you told me a story about a legend

134
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,360
that you would do very well in college?

135
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I first heard of Linus Pauling, the fall semester of my freshman year in chemistry class

136
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,360
and then there was a student who raised his hand to ask a question, and he said,

137
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,360
oh professor, does what you're talking about have anything to do with the Pauling theory of resonance,

138
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,360
and Professor Lumeur gave me a very respectful answer, and I thought to myself, I've never heard of Pauling,

139
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,360
but I guess I'd better learn something about this guy. Then remarkably enough, within the next two or three

140
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,360
weeks, it was announced that Linus Pauling had won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, so I

141
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,360
realized that this student was a little bit ahead of me in terms of knowing major scientific

142
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
themes.

143
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Did you make a letter about a letter you had in there about Pauling?

144
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Right, I guess you and I talked about that a few years ago. You want me to describe that for the

145
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Oregonian published an editorial a day or two after the Nobel Prize was announced.

146
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,360
It was basically congratulations to a native son of Oregon who went on and achieved the

147
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,360
great things, and won the Nobel Prize, but wasn't ashamed about his inaccurate thinking

148
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,360
and his political associations that had led him to have his passport lifted.

149
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,360
And I thought it was pretty inappropriate to bring these political things into

150
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,360
at a time when we should be celebrating this person's intellectual triumph.

151
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,360
And so I wrote my first letter to the editor ever, and at that time Reed College was in

152
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,360
very bad odor in the Portland area because the Velley Committee, which was the House on American

153
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Activities Committee, had toured the country in the spring just before I started college.

154
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,360
And three members of the Reed faculty were interviewed and refused to discuss their

155
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,360
associations, and this made a lot of people think that Reed was full of communist.

156
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,360
So when I wrote the letter to the editor, I used my home address from the

157
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,360
editor, which could be seen as being within the readership area of the Oregonian.

158
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:18,360
And then I guess I clipped the editorial and my letter and mailed them home to my mother.

159
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,360
And because my grandparents knew the Paulins, my grandfather was a member of the American Philosophical

160
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Society, which Paulin was also my mother mailed this to my grandmother, and my grandmother

161
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,360
mailed it to Paulin. And Paulin eventually sent me a nice short note, which pleased me a great deal.

162
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Paulin's youngest son, Crillon, was a classmate of mine at Reed, and then later on when I was a

163
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,360
graduate student at the University of Washington, and my wife was a graduate student in genetics,

164
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Crillon Paulin was doing his graduate work in genetics also.

165
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,360
So Kate and the Crillon worked in the same lab, and we used to see them socially, fairly frequently.

166
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,360
So somehow or another, I had a fairly close series of relationships with the Paulin family.

167
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,360
That's a heads-on idea about that. Can you reflect on the time with Crillon at all?

168
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm sorry? Can you reflect on your time with Crillon at all?

169
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Yeah, he was pretty immature, and he had a great sense of humor, he seemed to enjoy life a lot.

170
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:37,360
He started as a chemistry major at Reed, and he didn't do very well, so he switched to biology, and it took him five years to graduate.

171
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,360
So he started graduate school at UW a year after I had, and then I think it took him five or six years to finish his PhD.

172
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:59,360
But he actually published some fairly important papers from his postdoc, and then later on when he was on the faculty at San Francisco State,

173
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,360
as far as I remember right, he was chair of the biology department there for quite a few years.

174
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:15,360
And so he was always a very likable fellow, and he was on sabbatical here in 1980 and 1981.

175
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:25,360
He worked with Dick Morita in the microbiology department, and his second wife, K-Paul, I worked in art department as a postdoc with one of my colleagues.

176
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,360
So we reestablished contact, then it was very pleasant.

177
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:51,360
There was kind of an amusing, this doesn't have anything to do with college era, but during that year that Krell and Pauling was here, I was called upon to be the organizer of the, what used to be the annual biology colloquial, I'm not even sure if that's still held.

178
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:05,360
So I organized a two-day meeting on the organization and manipulation of genetic information, this is 1981, and we had a party for the speakers and the people were participating.

179
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:15,360
And President McVicker was at the party and he came up to me, and he said, Chris, I'd like to have you introduce me to winus Pauling Sun.

180
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:23,360
So I took him over and introduced him to Krell and he backed Krell and into a corner and wouldn't let him out and they were talking there for probably 20 minutes.

181
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,360
I was trying to think of a way that I could rescue Krell, but it didn't work.

182
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,360
So did you have any blinds Pauling?

183
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes, probably the first time I met him, he came to Seattle for a lecture and I met him there, so that would have been in 1961 when I was a student.

184
00:18:50,360 --> 00:19:08,360
But then my first month here, I started my employment as chairman of biochemistry and biophysics in January 1978, and one of the first things I learned in my first week on the job was that I had to get ready for sight visit for our department.

185
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Because the legislature in the previous year had made some sort of a budget note or order of some kind that there should be reviews of academic programs that might involve duplication between Oregon State and the U of O.

186
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Although the U of O didn't have a biochemistry department, they had the Institute of Molecular Biology and they had a biology department and a chemistry department.

187
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:46,360
So chemistry and biochemistry were getting reviewed and Linus Pauling was one of the outside reviewers that was brought in and it was fairly intimidating.

188
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:58,360
So I had to prepare for a day-long sight visit, I've forgotten who the other reviewers were, and then we had a similar experience.

189
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:07,360
We were a sight visit as a biology department as well, so I had to organize two sight visits.

190
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I remember the biology sight visit, one of the sight visitors was Herschel Roman, who was professor of genetics at the UW, and he was the one that my wife worked for.

191
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:34,360
And one of the other sight visitors was a guy named Gordon Lark, who was at Kansas State University who was quite a prominent bacterial geneticist, and when he met with me early in the morning, he said,

192
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:51,360
how did you move here anyway, and sort of a wondering what the deal was, what was the attraction, because I had a pretty good job at the University of Arizona before I moved here.

193
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,360
And then later in the day, when I met with him again, and they had a chance to talk to a lot of other people and learn about Oregon State.

194
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,360
You don't have to answer him anymore, he said, now I know why you moved here, so I felt pretty good about the decision I had made to move when that happened.

195
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:23,360
That gets a little bit away from Linus Pauling, but I met him two or three times when he came to the campus, either for the annual award of the Pauling Medal, or for other things, somehow we were brought into contact.

196
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,360
So I probably met him half a dozen times.

197
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Did I ever tell you the story about Pauling on the joke that he told at the Pauling? Do you want to hear that, it gets a little bit out of the chronology.

198
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:58,360
So the Three North Western sections of the American Accountal Society give the Linus Pauling Medal every year jointly, and there is symposium on a banquet, and the locale moves around from Corvallis to Seattle to Pullman Washington or wherever.

199
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:16,360
And in the fall of 1979 it was held here, and so Pauling used to come to all these, and after the banquet then he would give a little talk about what he'd been doing during the previous year, these things were always hugely entertaining.

200
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:35,360
And so the talk that I gave in 1979, and Mrs. Pauling was with him, she was still alive then, he said that he was encountering a lot of skepticism about Vitamin C, and the reporter was interviewing him, and he said, now Professor Pauling, you take Vitamin C, don't you?

201
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Well, of course I do, young man. Well then Sir, do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your state of vigor? No, go right ahead.

202
00:22:46,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Well Sir, can you tell me then please, when did you have your last sexual experience? Well I looked at him and I said why in 1956? And he said, well that's terrible.

203
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:07,360
And I said, what's so terrible about it? And he looked at his watch and said, it's only 22-10 now.

204
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Okay, well, give me back to your life. So we mentioned that Washington and Nancy Alling, everything Washington's yellow, how do you make this decision to go to the recovery?

205
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Okay, that's a good question too. In the summer of 1957, I went back to visit my grandparents in Long Island, and they were very interested in having me go to graduate school in the East Coast.

206
00:23:41,360 --> 00:24:02,360
So they took me to visit various schools, Harvard and Brown and Johns Hopkins. But one thing that I did, since they lived fairly far out on the island, they'd arranged a visit for me at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and I met with a biochemist there named Robert Steele, and he told me about what he was doing and he said,

207
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:11,360
I don't know why you're looking at all of these graduate schools in the East Coast when one of the best graduate schools in the country is right out of where you live, and I said, what's that?

208
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,360
And he said, well, the University of Washington, it's a new department, but it's really good. So I figured, well, I guess I'd better look at it.

209
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:39,360
So I ended up applying to vertically Johns Hopkins and the University of Washington, and in those days, in 1954, no, excuse me, 1957 and 58, you didn't get flown to departments to be interviewed at their expense.

210
00:24:39,360 --> 00:25:04,360
I had visited Johns Hopkins, I never did go down to the Cal, but I was home for the weekend and drove up to Seattle, and the department was small, it had just seven faculty members, but they were really nice, and they represented a nice cross section of the biochemist through that era, and they all had good records of academic achievement.

211
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:18,360
And it was pretty close to my family, and all living in the state of Washington at the time, and so I figured, why not, and worked out pretty well.

212
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Well, I was pretty on focus when I began graduate school. I, when my fellow students would ask me, what are you interested in?

213
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:45,360
I'd scratch my head and I'd say, well, I guess I'm interested in enzymes, but I'd like to do some project in enzymes that has potential applications in medicine or biology, what have you.

214
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:56,360
So, we were required to talk to all the faculty about their research, and the Frank Honeckins was doing work on folate and semology.

215
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:10,360
So folate is one of the B vitamins, and it's converted to a coenzyme tetrahydrofolate, and tetrahydrofolate is a coenzyme that mobilizes single carbon functional groups.

216
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:25,360
And so these are involved in methylation, for example, methylation of DNA, methylation of certain amino acids and proteins, and also the methyl group of thymine nucleotides that get into DNA.

217
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:40,360
And the Honeckins laboratory had just recently shown that, that the action of methotrexate, which is a folate analog, used in cancer treatment,

218
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:52,360
it was discovered in the 1940s, it was a very potent adylocumic agent that had acted by inhibiting an enzyme called dihydrofolate reductase that reduces folate to tetrahydrofolate.

219
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:03,360
And I thought this was really interesting, there wasn't very much known about the enzyme at the time, but the fact that the enzyme was a target for a very effective drug, meant that the this whole area of folate,

220
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:12,360
etymology had the kind of protein enzyme focus that I was interested in with potential applications of significance to medicine.

221
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,360
So I went to work with the phryconicons, and it worked out pretty well for me.

222
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:32,360
He was one major professor. One of the other reasons that I was interested in his lab was that I learned that he'd had several students who'd managed to finish their PhDs and fairly short order.

223
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:55,360
And I was interested in getting my PhD and moving on, and that worked out pretty well too, uncompleted by PhD requirements in a little under three and a half years, which is pretty fast by today's standards, where PhD had generally, you know, five-year program or so.

224
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Well, as you, when you were at the University of Washington, where can you do that many?

225
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,360
That's what I got married, that's what you're asking.

226
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Yeah, that's an interesting one too, because if my wife was a graduate school classmate in biochemistry, there were 12 entering students in the class of the entering class of 1958.

227
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:36,360
And we ended up as lab partners in the lab course, and then later in the year, as teaching assistants, we were assigned together to the, to the reagent room.

228
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,360
It was called the solution room, making up reagents for the biochemistry lab class for dental students.

229
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:55,360
And we were supposed to put in 10 hours a week of effort in our TA duties, and we worked pretty efficiently together, so I think maybe we worked two or three hours each per week.

230
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:08,360
And we didn't see each other socially at all at the time, she had a bunch of other boyfriends, and I think we both had the feeling that you didn't get involved with people that you saw every day.

231
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:27,360
But her interests were more biological, and the genetics department was founded in the spring of 1959, so she transferred to genetics so in our second year, when we were not seeing each other every day, it became a little bit more natural.

232
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,360
And so we got married in the spring of early summer of 1960, and it's kind of interesting because Kate grew up in Berkeley.

233
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Her mother was a research technician in the virus lab, she worked for Wendell Stanley, who won a Nobel Prize for his work in tobacco mosaic virus, and at Berkeley, the virus lab and the biochemistry department were in the same building at the time.

234
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,360
And Kate's mother tended to mother all the graduate students who were unattached.

235
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:13,360
So if I'd gone to Cal as a graduate student, we've always wondered whether Elsa would have sort of the mother of Megan picked me out of someone suitable for her daughter and would have got us together.

236
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:22,360
And we had a laugh over that over the years, but you can only live one life at a time.

237
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,360
She also had your first child as a natural candidate.

238
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Right, that wasn't planned. Lawrence was born maybe nine and a half months after we got married and drank champagne from a glass on our first wedding anniversary.

239
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:48,360
And so Kate never finished her PhD, and she claims, at various times I encourage her to do it.

240
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:58,360
She worked as a lab technician, and she also worked when I was at Yale. She worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Biology where I was.

241
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:05,360
And she always claimed that she really didn't want a PhD anyway. She loves working in the lab, and she's pretty good at it.

242
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:15,360
But she says she's good at the tactics, but not so good at the strategy at developing a long range line of research and applying for funding and that sort of thing.

243
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:28,360
So I think she's pretty happy with the kind of careers she had.

244
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Well, somehow it worked.

245
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:39,360
A lot of my fellow students would go back to work in a lab in the evening, and I just stay home.

246
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:52,360
And then Kate was very good about after Lawrence was born about seeing that I had a couple of quiet hours every evening.

247
00:31:52,360 --> 00:32:00,360
And I don't remember what's sitting around, but she was still working as a graduate student in the teaching assistant in the genetics department.

248
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Somehow it seemed to work.

249
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,360
So you finished up your PhD in UW and you did a postdoc at Penn.

250
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Yeah, by the time I was approaching finishing my PhD, I knew that I wanted to work in a biological system that had more potential for genetics.

251
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:37,360
I was getting more involved in the biological side of enzymology than the chemical or biophysical side and reading the literature.

252
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:49,360
I selected three people whose work I was interested in, and I wanted to be able to go to a lab where the specific experience that I'd had at the graduate student would be useful.

253
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:58,360
And so Seymour Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania was the one I eventually settled on.

254
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,360
And he was working on bacteriophages, bacterial viruses.

255
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:18,360
And basically in the late 1940s when he started with his own lab, he'd done what I would call the first biochemical experiments on what happens metabolically during a virus infection cycle using phages model systems for

256
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:26,360
plant or animal viruses, which of course were much more difficult to work with biochemically at that time.

257
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:44,360
And in the early 1950s, he and a postdoc had shown that DNA from certain bacteriophages had a very unusual modification in that all of the cytosine residues in DNA were modified by having a hydroxyamethyl group.

258
00:33:44,360 --> 00:34:03,360
And then on the mid to late 1950s, they'd shown the biochemical basis for this that there were new enzymes that were induced after a virus infection that put on the hydroxyamethyl group and that phosphorylated the nucleotides that get us at the point where it could be activated and incorporated in the DNA.

259
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,360
So the whole idea that virus infection stimulated new metabolic pathways was really exciting to me.

260
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:17,360
And this enzyme to put on the hydroxyamethyl group had a tetrahedral folate co-factor.

261
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:27,360
So it meant that I could bring some biochemistry to Cohen's lab that would be that would help them out.

262
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:42,360
And it was nice pairing. But again, in those days, now we're talking 1961, you didn't just hop on a plane to visit every lab that you were going to consider for a postdoc.

263
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:53,360
So I wrote to three people, and I was going to give a paper at the Federation meeting in April 1961.

264
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:03,360
This is the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, which at that time included societies for biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, nutrition and a couple of others.

265
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,360
And it was the big meeting for biochemists to go to.

266
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:15,360
And so the three people that I was considering would be at the meeting, and I could meet with them there.

267
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:22,360
This happened very shortly after Lawrence was born. So I really located that a gratitude.

268
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,360
And also my mother and Kate's mother and my grandmother who all came in and helped out.

269
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,360
But I was able to go to the meeting and meet with them. And it was kind of amusing because on the first day of the meeting,

270
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:47,360
I met Seymour Cohen for the first time. And apparently, my major professor, who had sent a letter of recommendation, sent a two-page letter.

271
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:58,360
And I didn't learn this till later. But the second page of the letter to Cohen had Dr. Boyer's name at the top of the page.

272
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:09,360
And so Seymour knew that I was considering more than one laboratory. And he had recently had someone very good who had accepted a postdoc and then went somewhere else and said,

273
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:18,360
so almost as soon as I shook hands with Seymour and introduced myself, he said, now see here, if I accept you and my laboratory are coming or aren't you.

274
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:31,360
And so it really set me off. And I wondered who is this guy anyway. But then I met the other two people during that week and by the end of the week.

275
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:43,360
I decided I wanted to work with Seymour. So I had another appointment with him. And almost before I had a chance to say anything, he said, well I've decided I'd like to have you come and join my lab.

276
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:52,360
And I said, well, that's funny. I decided I wanted to join your lab too. And then he insisted on driving me to Philadelphia. This is Atlantic City, which is about 60 miles from Philadelphia.

277
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:04,360
So I could see his lab and meet the other people, which I did. And that was very nice because then I knew them all by the time I joined his group six or eight months later.

278
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:14,360
So from there, he was on the Yale. How did that fund up and what was it like being trained in faculty member at Yale?

279
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Things were much different back then. I used to get unsolicited offers of assistant professors. They're not supposed to know offers.

280
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:31,360
I get a letter in the mail from the department chairman that would say would you like to apply for an assistant professorship in our department.

281
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:41,360
And Seymour Cohen would come into the lab on occasion with letters. They want me to recommend someone for this place of that place, would you like to apply?

282
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Most of the time I said, well, no. But Yale was interesting. My father had worked at the Yale Medical School after the war back in that interval between our lives in Washington State.

283
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:13,360
And then I knew Yale was a pretty good place. And so I told Seymour, he could go ahead and put my name in, if he'd like. But I told him, I really hope to get back to the West Coast.

284
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:25,360
And he said, well, fine, I'll write to a couple places where you'd like me to write. And I said, well, UC Davis has the new biochemistry department. It's pretty good. You could write to that.

285
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:36,360
And also the University of Oregon has this new Institute of Molecular Biology. They have some terrific people there. So he wrote to both places and they both wrote back and said they had positions and they were interested.

286
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:49,360
I should send my CV and so forth, which I did. And the meantime, then I was invited up to Yale to be interviewed. And it was an interesting day.

287
00:38:49,360 --> 00:39:05,360
I gave the seminar at noon. And then I met immediately after the seminar with the search committee. And they gave me a lunch date, which I was trying to eat at the same time. I was trying to answer the questions. It was pretty stressful.

288
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:18,360
And one of the search committee members took me to the train at the end of the day. And I went back to Philadelphia. And he said, well, we have to go through a series of steps before we can make.

289
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:33,360
We can make a decision on anything. But so maybe a while before you hear from us again. And I thought, well, that's fun. I'm not to hurry anyway because I want to see what develops at Davis and Eugene.

290
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:44,360
But within a week, I had a letter from them saying that the search committee had met and they decided they were going to recommend that I get the appointment and so forth.

291
00:39:44,360 --> 00:40:07,360
And eventually, I did get a formal offer of a letter. And I sort of stalled them as long as I could. And finally, it was a good offer. The salary was pretty poor. My comparison was what my cohort was getting at other places.

292
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:26,360
But it was the biology department. I didn't consider myself so much a biologist, but they were trying to build up biochemistry and molecular biology within the department. They wanted me to set up a lab class in biochemical research techniques that their graduate students could take.

293
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:47,360
So that was a challenge. Anyway, I accepted the job on Monday. And then I wrote to the department chairs at Eugene and Davis. And then on Thursday, the phone rang in the lab. And I took the call. It was the department chair at the view of oh, and he said, oh, Dr. Matthews, we just got your letter.

294
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:58,360
And we're terribly disappointed. We got your last recommendation and the fact we've had a meeting, we decided you'd be ideal for the job we were about to invite you to come out and give a seminar.

295
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Can we get you to change your mind? And I said, I'm sorry, I made a commitment. That was that. And then I went home thinking, I guess I'd give it up my last chance to go to a good university in the Pacific Northwest and who would have known what happened years later.

296
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:34,360
So I went to Yale in starting in January 1964. And today's assistant professors, of course, get almost the first year without significant teaching responsibilities to set up their lab.

297
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:55,360
And the very first thing I had to start setting up to teach this lab class that was beginning the end of the, well, the beginning of the spring semester, which was the end of January or the early February. And I had ordered almost everything I needed, but a teaching assistant and I had to set up the lab.

298
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:09,360
I had to write the protocols for all the labs that the students would do. This is a class of 15 students. So that was very busy with teaching. On the other hand, I also had my NIH research grant that started on January 1st.

299
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Grants were incredibly easy to get back then. And so I was buying equipment and hiring a technician and getting my research labs set up at the same time.

300
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:31,360
It was sort of a continuation of what I'd done as a postdoc. One of the things, this is actually kind of an amusing story too.

301
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:40,360
The thesis, my PhD thesis had been on the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which I told you was the target enzyme for metatruxate.

302
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:51,360
And there was another lab that had shown the enzyme that makes the methyl group of thymine reduces a methylene group to the methyl level that requires two electrons.

303
00:42:51,360 --> 00:43:03,360
And the rate of DNA synthesis after T4 phase infection goes up by about tenfold, which means there's a tremendous demand for DNA precursors, including thymine nucleotides.

304
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:13,360
And so since there's a two-electron reduction, it turns out that the tetrahhydrofolate is oxidized to dihydrofolate.

305
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:23,360
And so when I became aware of all this, and I was talking to CMR Cohen one day on the lab, and I said, you know with this big increase in demand for thymine nucleotides,

306
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,360
there are all these virus-induced enzymes that you and the other labs have been discovering.

307
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:36,360
We should be looking for dihydrofolate reductase. There should be a virus-specific form of dihydrofolate reductase as well.

308
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:42,360
I know how to assay the enzyme. I worked on it for my PhD. So I'd go ahead and do that.

309
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:50,360
And he said, why don't you focus on the problem that we agreed that you would work on when you came to the lab? And I said, okay.

310
00:43:50,360 --> 00:44:01,360
And then CMR was out of town for three days or so. And I did the experiment. And there was a 24-old increase in the specific activity of dihydrofolate reductase.

311
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:15,360
And in T-page, in fact, the cells is compared to uninfected cells and turned out to be really easy to show that it was a different enzyme from the corresponding enzyme that existed in the uninfected bacteria.

312
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:24,360
So one of the things I did, we got a short paper out of it, but one of the things that I did when I went to Yale was just a golden opportunity to get a furry paper.

313
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:34,360
We just purify the enzyme and characterize it, make mutants that were deficient in the production of the enzyme to see what their phenotype was and so forth.

314
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:42,360
So there were a number of problems related to DNA precursor metabolism, early in infection by T even.

315
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:54,360
In fact, there were just that got me off to a pretty decent start. And I published six or eight papers in the first couple of years that was in Yale, even though I had a pretty heavy teaching load.

316
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,360
So you were in Yale for four years, definitely?

317
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:07,360
Roughly, you got actually three and a half by the calendar, but they started my appointment as assistant professor in July of 1963.

318
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:23,360
And I was in absentia for the first half year. And then I taught that lab class. And then in the fall, they had me set up a lab for the, what was an undergraduate cell biology course, which was basically biochemistry.

319
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:33,360
And the fall semester and cell biology and the spring semester. So a colleague and I shared the fall course where he did most of the lecturing I taught the lab.

320
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:39,360
Did your research in the change of the course that kind of yellow or something specific with that same topic?

321
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
Oh, about the research?

322
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Yeah.

323
00:45:42,360 --> 00:46:05,360
I stayed pretty much with that. I was branching out a little bit more biologically and looking at questions such as the regulation, the time-specific regulation of gene expression, virus infection involves a very well scheduled program of events and gene activation and deactivation.

324
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:20,360
And so I was interested in what turns off the biosynthesis. These are really enzymes that are involved in DNA metabolism. And then the activation of the late proteins, which are mostly structural proteins of the virus and proteins that help the virus assemble.

325
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:30,360
So I was pretty much sticking with what I knew, but branching out in slightly different directions.

326
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,360
What was your sense of the culture of Yale?

327
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Yeah, that's an interesting question, too. It was all male, of course, as far as the undergraduate student body was concerned.

328
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:58,360
There was a fair amount of self-satisfaction. The undergraduate students were really bright, at least enough of them were really bright to make it worth the effort to teach them, to make it fun.

329
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:08,360
The graduate students seemed like kind of a mixed lot to me. I wasn't hugely impressed to them at the time except for some of the very good ones.

330
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:23,360
And what's turned out in retrospect is that I maybe was a little bit too hard of them because a number of the graduate students that I thought were okay have turned out to have very successful careers. I see their names in the literature all the time.

331
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:38,360
I guess the students were, they were as good as they thought they were. But in terms of the culture, my decision to leave Yale after a fairly short period there, was hastened.

332
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:50,360
I knew when I went there, I wouldn't have my whole career there. I didn't really want to live in the East Coast. I knew that most people would take a non-tenger jobs at the Indian Ivy League, move somewhere else.

333
00:47:50,360 --> 00:48:00,360
I thought it was a great place to start from. I might not have left so early, but we had a new department chair who came from Johns Hopkins.

334
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:14,360
And he was a fairly argumentative sort. He was someone who always wanted to put himself on the, he wanted to polarize discussions.

335
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:25,360
And so in my last year at Yale, the other biochemists in the department had gone on sabbatical, and no arrangements had been made to take his place.

336
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:34,360
So I was giving all of his lectures and the cell biology course, as well as teaching the lab in the fall and then teaching the graduate lab in the spring.

337
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:44,360
And in addition, I'd become a pre-medical advisor. So I had several dozen advisees that I had to meet with and write letters of recommendation for.

338
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:54,360
And I was being run ragged and trying to keep my research going as well. So there was a social function and I went out to the department chair.

339
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:01,360
There was a large department, there were about 45 people in the department, so he'd barely knew me.

340
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:09,360
And I engaged in a conversation and I asked him, what are your thoughts about teaching versus research in an academic environment?

341
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:16,360
And he said, well, of course you had to be a good teacher if you wanted to succeed at Yale, but the main objective was research.

342
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,360
He said, if you want to say at Yale, your research must assimilate, it must absolutely assimilate.

343
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:32,360
And if you ever want to be a full professor at Yale in this department, you have to be someone that we can confidently number among the top 50 biologists in the country.

344
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:41,360
So I went home and I figured with the amount of teaching and committee work I was doing, there wasn't any chance of my rising to the top 50.

345
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:51,360
And then I also looked around the department and I didn't see very many full professors that I would rank in the top 50 myself, there were one or two.

346
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,360
So that has something to do with the culture, I guess.

347
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,360
So you mentioned in 1967 you moved to Arizona.

348
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:11,360
Right, that came about because the department chair at Arizona had been one of my professors at the University of Washington, he was on my committee.

349
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:28,360
He was someone I liked a lot and he called me up one day and told me that the University of Arizona had a new medical school starting and that he just agreed to be chairman of the biochemistry department and what I liked to join him.

350
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,360
And I knew nothing about Arizona at the time.

351
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:40,360
But I liked his name with on hand a hand and he was in an area of biochemistry that's quite different from mine.

352
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:49,360
He was an expert on biochemistry fats and lipids and the idea of starting something new.

353
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:58,360
And there wasn't a matter of being interviewed of search committees and now I've got it basically just offered me a job over the phone.

354
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,360
And then I arranged to go out and visit.

355
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:12,360
This is in January 1967 and Kate went with me and we had to pay her expenses and it was just a wonderful time.

356
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:22,360
They put us up in a nice place and we got up in the morning and stepped out the front door and picked a grapefruit for our breakfast off the tree that was going right next to our front door.

357
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:34,360
And the dean and his wife took us out the dinner one night and in my years at Yale I never met my dean, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences.

358
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:41,360
And here was the dean taking us out the dinner and telling me how much they hoped that I would decide to go there.

359
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:51,360
It was a promotion, a rank to be an associate professor, big increase in salary and the opportunity to help shape something because the medical school is brand new.

360
00:51:51,360 --> 00:52:01,360
Everyone in Arizona was excited about the medical school that was starting and it just seemed like the right thing to do.

361
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:11,360
Yes, I really enjoyed the time that we spent there. We were there for ten and a half years.

362
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:19,360
And there was a lot of excitement in the first few years having the feeling that we were helping to build a place up.

363
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,360
The medical school there was maybe a half a mile from the main campus, maybe a quarter mile.

364
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,360
It was a five minute bike ride or a ten minute walk.

365
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,360
And there was a little biochemistry group in the chemistry department that was pretty good.

366
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,360
And the art department at the medical school was small.

367
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,360
We had, I think, five or six faculty the whole time I was there.

368
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,360
And so we merged and formed a joint graduate committee in biochemistry.

369
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:54,360
So that was one of the things that I felt was a contribution on my part and the part of Don Hanahan that we wanted to build bridges.

370
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:03,360
To the main campus, whereas in other fields like microbiology, there were barriers that were built up.

371
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,360
And the bridges, I think, really were beneficial to the university.

372
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:14,360
And now they have a combined university wide department that serves the main campus people and the medical school people.

373
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:23,360
And mostly located on the main campus, I think there are a couple of people left in the medical school building that focused on medical education.

374
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,360
So your obligation to stay in front of the old areas on it?

375
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,360
Yes, they did.

376
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,360
Of course, teaching medical students was quite a different experience.

377
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:44,360
But I did also teach courses on the main campus and mostly the advanced undergraduate graduate level course.

378
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,360
And some colleagues and I originated some graduate level courses.

379
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,360
I don't think I did any graduate teaching a Yale except for the graduate lab class.

380
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:04,360
So I taught courses in biological regulatory mechanisms and nucleic acids and so forth, as well as teaching undergraduates and medical students.

381
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:15,360
But overall, I think the teaching load was a little bit, I hate that term, teaching load, the teaching obligation.

382
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:21,360
Teaching opportunity was a little bit lighter than what it was at Yale.

383
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,360
And so there's a little bit more time to get involved in research.

384
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:36,360
And again, there was building the department, recruiting the other faculty members, beginning to recruit graduate students and getting funding for graduate student support and so forth.

385
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
It was a different experience.

386
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:45,360
So what kind of, what was your line of research?

387
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Well, I continued with some of the projects that were underway when I left Yale and picked up some new ones.

388
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:04,360
But they, for the most part, they had to do with the enzymology and regulation of DNA precursors.

389
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:22,360
One thing that happened was that people involved in T4 bacteriophage genetics had generated a large number of mutants that were available and there were mutants in maybe 15 genes that were involved in DNA synthesis.

390
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:29,360
And it wasn't clear what the biochemical functions of all these genes coded for.

391
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:41,360
And so I got involved in that a little bit to what extent do we, might some of these genes have to do with DNA precursors and metabolism, to what extent might they have to do with DNA replication itself.

392
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:55,360
And so at some stage, I became interested in the relationship between the synthesis of the four DNA precursors, A, G, C, and T to make it simplest.

393
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:01,360
And the replication apparatus, because DNA replication is a very rapid process.

394
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:09,360
And in bacteria or in phase infected bacteria, the DNA chain will grow at something like 7 or 800 dupletides per second.

395
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:22,360
So I started thinking, how can the enzymes that are making the precursors throughout the cell, how can a channel precursors to DNA polymerase, the replication apparatus, fast enough to sustain this rate.

396
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:45,360
So I started working on the premise that there was a super molecular organization within the infected cell with the precursor enzymes physically located close to the replica on the machinery that synthesized the DNA so that you could get channeling of precursors to DNA replication sites.

397
00:56:45,360 --> 00:57:01,360
And that was a pretty big part of my research. For several of the years I was there, I wanted to require quite a bit of time that I was here, but we picked up some lines of research on comparable questions in mammalian cells, working in tissue culture.

398
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:23,360
I also had a couple of students who worked on theses quite independently on things that were quite different from anything that I did. One of them was sure that aging was a question of gene expression and that you should be able to learn something about aging if you do something about the kinetics of dupletic acid metabolism.

399
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:39,360
And he did a thesis that was partly computational, partly biochemical on RNA metabolism that he published one paper published independently and one paper he put my name on as a curious gesture.

400
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:57,360
And after I came here, he joined my lab again. He had a grant and he needed a site that he could work for, he could work fairly independently and he remembered what him have his own head.

401
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:12,360
So he was here for a couple of years and then he got the idea of antisense as a potential drug and founded a company called antivirals in his recreation room here in Corvallis.

402
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:19,360
And then that turned into ultimately into avi by a farmer, which is about a technology company in Corvallis.

403
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:27,360
And eventually he left them and formed another company, gene tools, which is in phalloma and it's hugely successful.

404
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:42,360
So even though all I provided was a supporting environment at Arizona, it's turned out having a very nice spin-off here.

405
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,360
We're at about an hour, are you going to know, okay?

406
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Yeah, come on.

407
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:57,360
So this is your first experience of the Southwest, and you mentioned the experience of taking it great through the Southwest.

408
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:05,360
We really enjoyed living there and both Kate and I are pretty enthusiastic outdoors people.

409
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:12,360
And we found out that there's a lot more variety in Arizona than we ever believed there was.

410
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:21,360
Tucson is bring by four mountain ranges and we did a lot of backpacking there and we went camping in Mexico.

411
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:30,360
It turned out there were some very nice beach areas on the Gulf of California that we went and did weekend camping at.

412
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:38,360
And so we really did everything we could to enjoy and profit from the Southwest.

413
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:44,360
And we miss a lot of that. We miss being able to get into the out of doors 12 months of the year very easily.

414
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:54,360
But Tucson was growing with very little planning and Tucson is one of the largest cities in the world that gets all of its water from underground.

415
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:03,360
And when the chance came to come here, of course it was professionally a very nice opportunity.

416
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,360
We were happy to.

417
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,360
So I wondered, do we really want to move?

418
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,360
But one of the features was, how much longer is it going to mean up water to sustain the population?

419
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:18,360
How much longer are we going to have these beautiful desert environments that real estate the developments are crowding on to?

420
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:26,360
So that all convinced us that we really enjoyed the 10 years there but maybe it was time to go.

421
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:33,360
And every time we go back to Tucson, we're horrified at the additional growth that's occurred.

422
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,360
Do you put the sabbatical of the US, UCSD in 1973?

423
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:47,360
Right. Kate still criticizes me on occasion for not having taken a European sabbatical then because our children were something like 12 and 14 of them.

424
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,360
And they probably really would have profited from a year in Europe.

425
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:59,360
But I still had a fairly small research group and wanted to stay in reasonable close touch with them.

426
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:08,360
And of course, UCSD was a growing academic environment with some superb people and we lived near the beach.

427
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
So it was a very nice living for the year.

428
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,360
I split the year between two different laboratories.

429
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,360
So I had two different kinds of experiences.

430
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,360
And it was very nice. It was a good sabbatical.

431
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,360
What did you do there?

432
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:37,360
The first six months I worked with a guy named Gordon Sado who was an expert on culturing cells and maintaining their differentiated characteristics in culture.

433
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:55,360
And I wanted to learn literature culture because I wanted to be able to branch out with our interests into mammalian systems so I could take what we were learning in microbial model systems and apply them to mammalian or maybe human systems so I wanted to learn literature culture.

434
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:02,360
So I did a project that had to do with growth factors in cell culture.

435
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:17,360
And then in the second six months, I went to the script's institutional oceanography where I had a very good friend who was an expert on the biochemistry of early events in fertilization using the sea urchin.

436
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:29,360
And so fertilization is a little comparable to the phaging effect that is among the metabolic changes that occurs as a huge turn on a DNA synthesis.

437
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:43,360
And the cleavage cycles, the cell cleavage cycles are very fast. So DNA genomes are reproduced in the order of half an hour or so.

438
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:54,360
And so the question in my mind was, where do the precursors come from? Are they stored or is there a turn out synthesis? So that was what I worked on in Dave's lab.

439
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:07,360
And it turned out that the sea urchin egg has huge supplies of deoxyneucleuside triphosphates and then backup pools of the monophosphates and the triphosphates.

440
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:15,360
So the egg is really geared to activate DNA synthesis very soon after fertilization.

441
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:22,360
And I thought about going back and working on that system a little bit on my own after I came here, but never got around to it.

442
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,360
There are plenty of other things to do.

443
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,360
That's right. That's great.

444
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,360
No, I don't think so.

445
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Yeah, he was been at the Sock Institute. I've forgotten when he moved there. I should know that because I reviewed the biography of France as quick just a few months ago for a journal and made fascinating reading.

446
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:57,360
It was always like, yeah, in my review, I wrote that I've been asked to review quite a few scientific books over the years.

447
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,360
This is the first one I actually read word for word cover for cover cover. It's just read like a novel.

448
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,360
But I'm pretty sure that was before Kirk had moved to Sock.

449
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,360
Over here.

450
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,360
What was that right?

451
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:23,360
Which I don't know about that because I knew the name already. I knew he was a famous historian of science, the recent historian of science.

452
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:28,360
Yeah.

453
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:35,360
Seymour Cohen was very interested in the early history of molecular biology.

454
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:45,360
He was pretty unpopular with the with the crowd in that field because he was so aggressively pro biochemical and didn't necessarily believe in genetics.

455
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,360
And Seymour Cohen was the first grad with student of Irwin Shargaf.

456
01:04:50,360 --> 01:05:04,360
Shargaf who had promulgated the base composition of regularities that helped Watson quick developed their model.

457
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,360
And Shargaf had been very bitter about being left out of credit for that.

458
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:16,360
And I think Seymour shared Shargaf's bitterness to some extent.

459
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:23,360
And so when the Nobel Prize was announced, I was in Seymour's lab. And this is 1962.

460
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:28,360
And it went to Watson and Kirk and Maurice Wilkins.

461
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,360
And so Seymour came into the lab and said, well, if they were going to

462
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:39,360
include Wilkins and the Nobel Prize, they should have included Shargaf because his contribution was just as substantial.

463
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:47,360
And I think he could make a pretty good case for that. But of course, the Nobel Prize is limited to three awardees.

464
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,360
So I'm sure that didn't do very much for Irwin Shargaf's mood either.

465
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,360
But he was the average age for the talented full guy.

466
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:03,360
Yeah, he was. In fact, Shargaf was the one who got me started thinking about Seymour Cohen.

467
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:11,360
Because my second year in graduate school, Shargaf came to Seattle and gave a series of lectures.

468
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,360
And during the lectures, he talked about virus and dosenzyme.

469
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:23,360
He talked about work by, done by, quote, my student, Seymour Cohen, unquote.

470
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,360
And so immediately went to the literature and started reading Seymour Cohen's papers.

471
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,360
I'd never heard them before. And that was what got me fired up.

472
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,360
And the fact that Seymour was Irwin Shargaf's student.

473
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:50,360
At some point, I met the guy that was the chairman of biochemistry at Columbia when Shargaf had moved from Europe.

474
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:56,360
I think he was a refugee. And the Columbia took him in.

475
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,360
And so the chairman, his name was Hans Clarke. He was quite a distinguished biochemist.

476
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:05,360
Tell me what you're doing, Dr. Matthew. And I said, well, I'm a postdoc in the University of Pennsylvania.

477
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,360
Oh, who are you working with? I'm working with Seymour Cohen.

478
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:13,360
Oh, yes. Seymour. He's one of my boys, you know.

479
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,360
It was very paternal or paternalistic.

480
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,360
And so Seymour was Irwin Shargaf's student.

481
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,360
But it turned out that when Seymour was working on his postdoc or on his PhD,

482
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,360
neither of them was working on nucleic acids at the time.

483
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:36,360
Seymour had done his PhD thesis on lung surfactant, which is a phospholipid.

484
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:44,360
And it wasn't until years later that both Shargaf and Cohen independently started working on nucleic acid biochemistry.

485
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:52,360
So there's something kind of fascinating about the personalities involved in the recent history of science.

486
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:57,360
Yeah. Cohen felt like he was definitely a pretty big figure in life.

487
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:04,360
He was, you know. He taught a famous course in comparative biochemistry.

488
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,360
I don't remember why I never sat in on the course I should have.

489
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,360
But he was very broadly based. He was very rigorous in his thinking.

490
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,360
And he had a pretty priculous personality.

491
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,359
So he was definitely a challenge to work for.

492
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,359
But he was so broad.

493
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:32,359
And he had so many ideas that I think it influenced me to read pretty widely in science and trying to maintain a broad awareness.

494
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,359
That's helping a lot and writing a textbook.

495
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:40,359
And also, since I became a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Biological Chemistry,

496
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:49,359
I get sent papers to review that are way, way outside of my area because the editors know that I can sit down and read something.

497
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:59,359
I got a paper to review a couple of years ago on the biochemistry body order, if you believe that.

498
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,359
Well, we converted this a little bit in 1972.

499
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:06,359
Oh, I see what it sounds like. They made a pretty good offer to you.

500
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:13,359
Right. There was an interesting situation too.

501
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,359
I didn't have any real reason to believe ours on it.

502
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:20,359
I said, you can always find things to feel uneasy about.

503
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:30,359
But I felt pretty well accepted on the campus.

504
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:34,359
But I said my family was all still in the Pacific Northwest.

505
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:37,359
And so I kept my eye out for opportunities.

506
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:43,359
And the OSU advertised for a chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Science.

507
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,359
So I wrote, sent my CV, and eventually was asked for my references,

508
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:54,359
always sent the names, references, and eventually was asked to interview.

509
01:09:54,359 --> 01:10:01,359
And I had enough information about the department to know that it was a pretty good department.

510
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:06,359
And they sent me the data on the research funding of the faculty.

511
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:09,359
And there were 14 faculty at the time.

512
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,359
And everyone except one had some kind of outside research funding.

513
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:18,359
Publication records looked pretty good.

514
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:23,359
So on the days when I was interviewed, it was a two day or two and a half day process.

515
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,359
I had a series of half hour talks with the faculty.

516
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:32,359
And each one, I would say, you know, you got a good department.

517
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:34,359
Why are you looking outside for your chair?

518
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:37,359
You could fill the chairmanship inside.

519
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,359
And I got told pretty much the same thing by everyone.

520
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:45,359
And of course, when you get consistency, that's a pretty good sign.

521
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:50,359
And what they said was, this is our only chance to bring in a senior level faculty person

522
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:58,359
to bring in a funded research program and give a jump start to our department's reputation.

523
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:06,359
Because if we appointed an inside person, the chair of them would have to fill the vacancy at the system professor level.

524
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:07,359
So that made sense.

525
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,359
And they said that the department was in pretty good shape, scientifically.

526
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,359
And personally, everyone got along, which really seemed to be the case.

527
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:24,359
And so what they wanted was someone who was a pretty active scientist and teacher who was willing to do some administration and leadership.

528
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:27,359
And that was sort of how I saw myself.

529
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:33,359
I knew by that time I could probably handle the administrative details of being a department chair,

530
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,359
but it wasn't the be all and end all of my existence.

531
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,359
And so it was a pretty good fit.

532
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:47,359
And then after a few weeks after the interview with the dean called up to offer me a job, it was my 40th birthday.

533
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:53,359
And so it seemed like a, it seemed like an omen of some kind.

534
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:59,359
And that was kind of amusing too, because I put in a call, oh, this happened later on.

535
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:04,359
So I got the offer and then Kate and I were invited back to visit again in this time.

536
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:11,359
It was a recruitment visit, and it was very pleasant again.

537
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:17,359
And then went back home and after a while thought things over and decided I would accept the job.

538
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:21,359
So I put in a call to the dean and he was out of the office.

539
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:27,359
And he would call back and I sat there thinking I was about to make a decision that would affect the rest of my life.

540
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,359
And the phone rang, and I thought it was Dean Prouse calling me back.

541
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:35,359
No, it was the guy from the biochemistry department of the University of California, Davis,

542
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:40,359
asking if I'd like to be considered for the chairmanship of the department there.

543
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:45,359
And I said, you got a great department, but I think it's a little too late.

544
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:53,359
So what was the set of priorities for the chairmanship in the OSU?

545
01:12:53,359 --> 01:13:01,359
The main priority for me was for me to keep my research program visible and productive.

546
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,359
It's quite a job to move a research program.

547
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,359
I knew that the department would be in pretty good shape.

548
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,359
There were a few things that needed to be done.

549
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,359
You know, I knew I could handle whatever teaching I need to do here.

550
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,359
But not all the people that were working with me and Tucson chose to come.

551
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,359
So I had to appoint some more people.

552
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:30,359
And my major research grant had, I don't remember a year and a half or so to run.

553
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:34,359
And I just wanted to make sure that I'd got enough papers out during that time.

554
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:36,359
So I'd be competitive.

555
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:39,359
It was grants were already that's now in the late 1970s.

556
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:42,359
The grant situation was beginning to tighten up.

557
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:44,359
So that was my first priority.

558
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:46,359
It worked out pretty well.

559
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:50,359
Did the administrative pressures change over time?

560
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,359
Yes.

561
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:57,359
But actually getting back to priorities for just a minute,

562
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,359
there were some things in the department early on that I felt should get taken care of.

563
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:07,359
One was the fact that graduate students,

564
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:11,359
there was hardly any money in the department to support teaching assistance.

565
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:15,359
So there wasn't much state money that would support students who weren't committed to allow.

566
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:19,359
So almost all the students came on research assistantships,

567
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,359
which meant they were committed to the lab whose research grant was paying their assistantship.

568
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:30,359
And I thought that a first year graduate program should have

569
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:34,359
opportunity for students to come on committed.

570
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:39,359
I thought it was a great strength that students could come here and start right to work with a person

571
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:47,359
that they wanted to work with but that many students come without a specific set of interest

572
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,359
and they should have an opportunity to go through rotations.

573
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:56,359
So pretty high priority for me early on was to get an NIH training grant that would provide funds for

574
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:01,359
tuition and stipends for half a dozen students or so so that we could bring out a few

575
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:06,359
and give them a year to look around and then go on to research assistantships.

576
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:13,359
And my first attempt was unsuccessful.

577
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:20,359
That was kind of interesting too because we got kind of a mediocre score on the grant application

578
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:31,359
and really kind of a snotty critique in which the whoever reviewed the grant said the training record

579
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,359
of the faculty doesn't seem to be particularly strong.

580
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:38,359
Most of the graduate seemed to have taken jobs in industry.

581
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:42,359
And I wrote to the NIH and I said, what is this?

582
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:48,359
It seems to me that Congress which funds the NIH might have second thoughts about the training

583
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:52,359
and program of industrial positions are seeing a second rate.

584
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:58,359
So I'm going to revise the application and I'd like to have a site visit so you can see what we have out here.

585
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:04,359
And so the second time we had a site visit and we got the grant and had it for two or three cycles.

586
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:09,359
So that was sort of an institutional priority for me.

587
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:22,359
And then in 1981, so this was an opportunity that sort of dumped in my lap but it was an institutional priority for me.

588
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:33,359
The dean called me in and said that the MJ Murdoch Charitable Trust, you know about the Murdoch Trust.

589
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:40,359
This is a large foundation that was created from the estate of Jack Murdoch who was one of the founders of Tectronics.

590
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:46,359
Murdoch died prematurely in an airplane accident.

591
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:58,359
And he left most of the state entrusted as a foundation to support educational, charitable, and community organizations of Southern Northwest.

592
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:02,359
And they used to give project grants to faculty here.

593
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:15,359
But apparently the trust had told President Winkert that they now wanted to focus their grants more on large multi-person projects that represented institutional priorities.

594
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:23,359
And so the dean and the president and others then decided that he was time to make a push in molecular biology.

595
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:28,359
And so they called me in as the person to sort of the point person to write something up.

596
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:32,359
And it was clear, that was right.

597
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:43,359
It was very much a time to make a push even though that doesn't pretty good people scattered around the university here in that area.

598
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:53,359
And it was clear to me that there's multi-departmental cooperation is very strong on this campus.

599
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:58,359
And so whatever we did should be in a multi-departmental, multi-disciplinary framework.

600
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:05,359
So I proposed that the university create something that would be called the Center for Gene Research.

601
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:21,359
And that the grant then fund three positions and pay their salaries and start-up costs for two years with the commitment by the university that their salaries would be continued at the end of that two years.

602
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:26,359
And that search would be conducted in a multi-departmental framework.

603
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:31,359
There was a little money also for project grants for the faculty that was here.

604
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:40,359
And so then when the grant was funded, we had a multi-departmental search that bought three excellent people in.

605
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:45,359
One who came to our department is now the chairman of our department, Gary Merrill.

606
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:50,359
One who went to botany, Carol Rubin, and one who went to microbiology.

607
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:56,359
And that's Dennis Ruby who's now the chief scientific officer at Seagal Farm of Seagal.

608
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:58,359
So very good people.

609
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:07,359
In the meantime, the people in the ag school wanted to form a biotechnology institute or biotechnology center.

610
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:18,359
And President Wicker told him that the campus wasn't big enough to have two competing centers and areas related to biotechnology.

611
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:20,359
And they'd better work with us.

612
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:23,359
So we made the center.

613
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:33,359
I mean, I had no idea it would grow to something that encompassed the whole campus the way it did, but it turned out to be very successful.

614
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:50,359
And in the first several years, I think 1985, the center had caught on so well that the legislature appropriated a pretty fierce chunk of change as continuing a continuing budget for that time with the CGRB.

615
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:53,359
So that was something else that worked out pretty well.

616
01:19:53,359 --> 01:20:01,359
And then I served the director of the center for a year and a half or so after the first director left the fairly abruptly.

617
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:05,359
But what did the center stand for?

618
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:13,359
Well, it continued to get bigger and stronger.

619
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:26,359
And after I resigned as director because I couldn't handle two administrative jobs and still keep a research lab going and keep my teaching going.

620
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:36,359
And so there was sort of an interim appointment made while there was an outside search and Russ mines came from the University of Nebraska and he built it up a bit.

621
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:45,359
And then he retired and then the really big push came when Jim Carrington was brought in.

622
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:50,359
And of course he had a superb research program.

623
01:20:50,359 --> 01:21:01,359
And so I think his program attracted a lot of other people and departments all over the campus were beginning to use molecular biology techniques.

624
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:14,359
So the center and then Jim changed the focus to the center with a big emphasis on genomics and computational biology.

625
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:19,359
In fact, the name of the center was changed. I didn't realize this for a couple of years. It's still the CGRB.

626
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:28,359
But now instead of being the center for gene research and biotechnology, it's the center for genomics research and bio computing.

627
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:41,359
And so five or six years ago, there was a university wide hiring initiative in genomics and bio computing.

628
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:49,359
And there was another multi departmental search that I think brought five faculty members.

629
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:58,359
And they're outstanding people. One of them is Michael Freitag who came to the art department and his office is right next door to mine.

630
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:03,359
And one is Todd Mochler and botanates and extremely well.

631
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:13,359
I think he I think he left Carrington left this year to become president of the director of the Danforth foundation in St. Louis.

632
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:41,359
I just learned it there to the Mochler one with him. But it's really outstanding. People came and the focus to the center change. And it's it's well rooted in the university, the central service lab, which which the center maintains carries out multi investigator procedures, nucleic acid sequencing and oligopeptide synthesis.

633
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:55,359
That it's been doing for years, but it also has a very large computational and second generation DNA sequencing capability grafted on. So it's got bigger and stronger over the years.

634
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:02,359
So getting back to the administrative responsibilities, how did they shift over the years?

635
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:13,359
They shifted in that it got it got harder and harder to get money and there was a little bit more administration that had to get done.

636
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:23,359
So the first year or two I was here, one of my colleagues got money and one of his grants, $100,000 to buy an electron microscope.

637
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:35,359
This is one our department was telling what are your all. And he came to me said we need a room to put the electron microscope in it. I said, well, I guess we're going to have to see the deans. We want to see Dean Kraus.

638
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:52,359
And it was maybe a 15 minute conversation. And he found 50 some thousand dollars to renovate some space on the first floor to wonder. And so we got the pretty substantial amount of money on the basis of a short one short conversation.

639
01:23:53,359 --> 01:24:06,359
And getting money became harder and harder and at one point. So our department was very has always been very heavily involved with the Environmental Health Science Center.

640
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:14,359
This is a center that's funded with a core grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

641
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:28,359
It was originally headquartered basically on what used to be the Department of Agricultural Chemistry. And that again is a center that's become bigger and stronger over the years.

642
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:37,359
And at some point when the previous director retired, Don Reed, who was an art department, became the director so we're heavily involved with that center.

643
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:49,359
And one of the hardest things for me in my last several years of being department share was accumulating competitive startup packages when we wanted to recruit a faculty member.

644
01:24:49,359 --> 01:25:06,359
That's one thing to get a salary line. But around the country the amount of money you had to put together to track someone who was getting larger and larger because a new assistant professor couldn't count on getting his or her first grant funded and needed some money from day one.

645
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:25,359
And I remember one of the people who came in as vice president for research, which is of course one of the major sources that we would go to, I think I've suppressed his name because I dislike him so much.

646
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:39,359
Somehow or another, he never caught on to the idea that the discretionary funds he had as a disposal, one of the highest priorities of them should be contributions toward setup funds.

647
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:56,359
And Don Reed was still the director of the EHSC and I talked or so blue in the face before we got a token contribution from them and we were just really irritated.

648
01:25:56,359 --> 01:26:16,359
And I remember another interesting episode we had with the Environmental Health Science Center. When Don Reed became director of the center, this was in the early 1980s, he also was pretty expansionist, he wanted to build and solidify the EHSC and this sort of parenthetical.

649
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:34,359
In my opinion, one of the strengths of Oregon State, I said something about the inter-departmental cooperation, you have strong individual departments but you have these centers that span departmental boundaries, we have the CGRB, the EHSC and of course the Linus Pauling Institute.

650
01:26:34,359 --> 01:26:42,359
And I think all of these centers have done nothing but good things for the university by bringing in more research strength.

651
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:57,359
So one thing that Don Reed wanted to do was to use the funds he had in the center to establish two or three new faculty positions that would be partly funded by the EHSC and partly funded by university funds.

652
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:09,359
So one of the positions would be in our department, if you wanted to get someone who was using cell culture to study basically areas related to environmental toxicology.

653
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:26,359
And the Dean at the time said well, our department was over staffed already that we had too many faculty positions for the number of credit hours that we taught, you know, the kind of thinking that administrators go through.

654
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:35,359
And of course, both Don and I saw this as a great opportunity to strengthen the department research wise and bring in some more money to the department.

655
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:52,359
And Don was pretty aggressive, so he set up a appointment meeting with President Baker and six or eight of a sat around the table, including Don and myself and George Keller who was the vice president for research at the time.

656
01:27:52,359 --> 01:28:00,359
And Dean Sugahara, Dean of the College of Science and the president, maybe one or two others.

657
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:13,359
And Dean Sugahara went through his routine that the department was over staffed already and he couldn't justify putting even a part of his salary into our budget under the circumstances.

658
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:18,359
And then Don Reed gave his pitch, I don't think I said much of anything.

659
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:23,359
I was there to support Don got all the negative brownie points from the Dean.

660
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:28,359
And at the end of Don's talk, President Baker said, well, it sounds like a pretty good proposal.

661
01:28:28,359 --> 01:28:32,359
Let's go ahead with it. And I thought the Dean was going to cry.

662
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:39,359
And so from that point on, Don Reed's name was poison in the College of Science.

663
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:46,359
But it worked out very well. He brought in David Barnes, who's no longer here, but that position was established.

664
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:52,359
And we have got a research facility that's helped the whole campus community.

665
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:56,359
And then he brought in Dale Mosbow in what was at camp.

666
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:06,359
And Mosbow had a superb research program until he died very young in 2004.

667
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:19,359
But the idea that you could use Center funds to strengthen research programs within departments,

668
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:29,359
and the strength and inter-departmental cooperation has been a key note for the CDRB, the EHSC, and the Linus Paulingist.

669
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:37,359
In fact, the really history of the Linus Paulingist is pretty interesting, too.

670
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:43,359
Don Reed was acting director of the Institute. Well, we had a search for director.

671
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:50,359
And I was chair of the search committee that brought both right here.

672
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:54,359
And that worked out extremely successfully. Both it's so good.

673
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:57,359
And the people he brought in are just outstanding.

674
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:08,359
But I think the only time I ever had a one-on-one conversation with President Brisser was shortly.

675
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:17,359
While this was all underway, I think I don't remember whether Balls Friday arrived yet, or when we were still having research.

676
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:26,359
But of course it was concerned all over the campus about LPI, how it would drain research resources away from the administration.

677
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:35,359
And of course the Linus Pauling Institute in California was pretty mixed with scientific quality.

678
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:40,359
And that was a bit of a concern. But John Byrne really pushed the whole thing.

679
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:52,359
It was his legacy to the university. And so Brisser and I were walking together from some function.

680
01:30:52,359 --> 01:31:00,359
And it was just the two of us. And he said, what do you think about this move of the Linus Pauling Institute anyway?

681
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:04,359
It was obvious. He was pretty negative about the whole thing.

682
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:11,359
And I said it doesn't make any difference what you or I think about it. It's happening anyway.

683
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:16,359
At the time I think I was one of the cautious ones out of two.

684
01:31:16,359 --> 01:31:25,359
But I would become nothing but a supporter because we were so fortunate in getting Balls to come here as our first choice.

685
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:36,359
I thought the recruitment would be very difficult because the LPI occupied space that our department had occupied before we moved to Ag and Life Sciences.

686
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:46,359
And the space was pretty trashed. But Balls saw that it could work.

687
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:53,359
They did a little bit of renovation. And of course they said that a new building would be something that would be fairly high on the priority scale.

688
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:57,359
But it took a long time. But it worked.

689
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:05,359
So you asked about the administrative load. The other thing that happened in those last several years was the planning of the Ag and Life Sciences building.

690
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:24,359
That took a lot of time. And in the initial planning I became aware that there were documents in the university that had five levels of space assignment depending on what kind of department or college you were in.

691
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:31,359
And of course agricultural forestry were on the highest level.

692
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:38,359
Number square feet per FTE of lab space, square feet per FTE for office space.

693
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:42,359
And science was a level below Ag.

694
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:47,359
And so we started having our first planning meetings.

695
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:54,359
And it was mostly Ag people, of course, because of the Ag and Life Sciences.

696
01:32:54,359 --> 01:33:06,359
And biochemistry biophysics was put into the department sort of accidentally. And the way I understood it was the administration was having trouble assembling funding for the building.

697
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:14,359
And it's all seriously, but the way I heard it was the George Keller said, well, we don't have enough pizzazz in the building.

698
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:21,359
We have range science. We have ag administration. We have horticulture. They're all perfectly justifiable.

699
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:27,359
But we need to put some of our environmental science. We need to put some of our biotechnology in there.

700
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:36,359
And apparently Dean Horn was at the planning meeting. He said, well, biochemistry biophysics is heavily involved in both biotechnology and environmental health science.

701
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:48,359
So we were moved in very quickly. But then it turned out that they wanted to assign us space on the science level assignment.

702
01:33:48,359 --> 01:33:56,359
And I figured if we're moving to the new building, we need to have the same kind of space allocation that the other departments in the building had.

703
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:12,359
Is about that time about that time a friend of mine who was chairman of the search committee for Dean of Science at Penn State invited me to come to look at the job.

704
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:19,359
And after I looked at it, it was, I didn't want the job, but it was clear that they wanted me.

705
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:30,359
So I went to talk to Graham Spaniard, of course, who would come here from Penn State, and now his back there is one of the most successful university presidents in the country.

706
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:39,359
And Graham was, was very excited to hear that they wanted me to go to Penn State. He didn't talk to me at all about what can we do to keep you.

707
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:43,359
He wanted to know a lot about what was happening at Penn State and so forth.

708
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:54,359
But he did eventually, you know, what would it take to keep you? And I had two things in mind that would benefit the department.

709
01:34:54,359 --> 01:35:01,359
And one of them was space allocation of the new building. I said they're basically trying us to talk and sound on space.

710
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:21,359
We have adequate space in one of the spaces kind of second rate quality was, but if we're going to be asked to help plan a new building and move into space, we need to, we need to be assured that we don't have to accept any less square footage of what we have now.

711
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:28,359
So he put that on a letter and that helped me a lot is went through the planning process, but that took a lot of time too.

712
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:36,359
Were there any major shifts in your research during the years?

713
01:35:36,359 --> 01:35:48,359
Yes, not major. I've always, I've always been involved in, in nucleotide, the oxygen nucleotide and DNA precursor in zymology and biochemistry.

714
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:53,359
Yeah, I can tell you look, yeah, the answer is yes, I'll get to that in a minute.

715
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:58,359
But I'll tell you another story about the new building that you might find entertaining.

716
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:06,359
This has to do with the administrative load and you have to watch these guys all the time, actually two stories.

717
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:18,359
One time we were in a meeting in the administration building and they, we were being told that there wasn't enough money to build a building with size that was being discussed at the beginning.

718
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:23,359
And we were going all around the table, what can we do about this cut back and that cut back?

719
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:30,359
And it was, it was getting pretty late in the country in the evening, you know, six o'clock, six, three or so.

720
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:38,359
And the guy named Ed Cote was the vice president for the administration of the time and he was kind of a laughing stock in the faculty.

721
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:41,359
And he was getting more and more impatient.

722
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:47,359
He basically said, finally, hey, it's getting late here.

723
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:52,359
Let's just lop off a floor and we can leave.

724
01:36:52,359 --> 01:36:55,359
So that's a solidified review about Ed Cote.

725
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:58,359
And somehow it ended up that the building was built.

726
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:01,359
I think the university got a bargain. It's a very good building.

727
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:03,359
He was done with the funds available.

728
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,359
But at one point the architect told me.

729
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:13,359
That we've built a prototype laboratory.

730
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:21,359
So you and your colleagues can go over, look at it, look at the cabinets, look at the shell, look at the bench top, look at the utility and see what it looked like.

731
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:28,359
And I said, well, it's in, in Moreland Hall, there's a member of the psychology faculty.

732
01:37:28,359 --> 01:37:31,359
Bill Smotheren, who does physiological work.

733
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:35,359
And he needed an upgrade to his lab.

734
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:40,359
So we've built that as a prototype lab and you can go on and see what it looks like.

735
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:42,359
And so we went over and it did its nice lab.

736
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:46,359
And so we could see what kind of countertops they were going to have and the new building and so forth.

737
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:53,359
And then it occurred to me to ask someone, hey, where the money come from to do this?

738
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:58,359
And it turns out that Bill Smotheren had been offered a job in another institution.

739
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:06,359
And he needed, in order to stay, one of the things that he needed was an upgrade to his lab.

740
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:10,359
So we went to his dean, the dean went to the then provost.

741
01:38:10,359 --> 01:38:17,359
And somehow things had come about so that the money was siphoned out of our building project to build this guy's lab.

742
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:19,359
And so we raised hell about it.

743
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:23,359
And so they had to find the money from somewhere else and put it back into the building project.

744
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:29,359
So you had to be on your toes all the time about these guys.

745
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:33,359
So getting back to research.

746
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:39,359
I had a graduate student in the early who finished in about 1982.

747
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:47,359
Who did his thesis on the DNA precursor supply for the mitochondrial genome?

748
01:38:47,359 --> 01:39:00,359
I'd seen a paper in the literature that suggested that the mitochondrial genome is fed by a distinct precursor pool that might be generated within the mitochondria.

749
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:13,359
And so Rick Besswick did a thesis on the series of experiments and indicated, yes, indeed, that the pools were physically distinct and the regulatory sense as well.

750
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:19,359
And then that sort of sat there until the late 1990s.

751
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:26,359
And another graduate student joined our group, Shi Wei Song, Chinese student, who wanted to follow up on that work.

752
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:30,359
He was a medical degree from China.

753
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:39,359
And the number of diseases had been described that have genetic effects within the mitochondria.

754
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:42,359
And some of them are mutations within the mitochondrial genome.

755
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:50,359
Some of them are mutations within the nuclear genome that encode proteins that are transported into mitochondria and function there.

756
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:53,359
And so there's some very interesting diseases.

757
01:39:53,359 --> 01:40:08,359
And of course now there's also the idea that accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial genome is partly responsible both cancer and aging.

758
01:40:08,359 --> 01:40:16,359
Since we knew that aspects of DNA precursor metabolism are mutagenic determinants.

759
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:20,359
That is metabolic derangement.

760
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:27,359
But if you will, the oxygenucleotide metabolism can affect the mutation rate.

761
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:36,359
We wanted to learn more about the mitochondrial pools of DNA precursors where they came from, how they were regulated, and how this might affect the mutation rate.

762
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:43,359
It turns out the mutation rate for the mitochondrial genome is much higher than it is for the nuclear genome.

763
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:45,359
And why should this be?

764
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:51,359
So Shi Wei did his thesis on this, and he was one of my last graduate students to finish.

765
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:58,359
But by the time he started publishing papers from his thesis, we began to get some notice for this.

766
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:11,359
So I got funding actually after I retired and was hoping I'd be able to keep research funding going because this was turning out to be a pretty productive line of research.

767
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:24,359
So in fact, that has been the total of our research since about 2003 and had pretty decent funding for that.

768
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:36,359
During that time, the three graduate students that I had at the time I retired in 2002, they took two or three or four years to finish and they were done.

769
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:45,359
But after that, I kept my lab going with a technician and a postdoc and one or two undergrad was supposed to be done.

770
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:53,359
Now I've decided to let my funding expire and there's a new faculty member in our department that's going to take over our lab.

771
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:56,359
So my last grant expires the end of the year.

772
01:41:56,359 --> 01:42:02,359
But for the last few years, it's taken the knowledge and the background I have.

773
01:42:02,359 --> 01:42:11,359
And the oxygen nucleotide metabolism just applied it to mammalian cells and mitochondrial metabolism.

774
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:16,359
The last sort of big topic I'd like to talk about is your textbook by chemistry.

775
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:25,360
So what was the process in which you had been told that you were going to do this?

776
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:34,360
In 1983 and 1984, there were two major texts that came out.

777
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:39,360
And we have two sort of advanced level undergraduate courses.

778
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,360
BB-450, 451, which most students take as a two quarter sequence.

779
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,360
And then BB-494-91 and 492.

780
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:51,360
And these can both be taken under graduate or graduate.

781
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:57,360
And these two books came out and one of them we assigned to the 450 course and one we adopted for the 490 course.

782
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,360
And they're both terrible.

783
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:08,360
And at some point in the spring, I was eating my lunch in my office and a publisher's representative came in.

784
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:11,360
And I sort of set my sandwich aside.

785
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:18,360
And so I told them how disappointed we were with all the textbooks that were on the market.

786
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:22,360
And he said, well, you know so much about what's wrong with all these books.

787
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,360
You ought to be writing your own book.

788
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,360
And I said, are you crazy?

789
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:29,360
I don't have the time or the expertise to write a whole book.

790
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,360
I said, well, get a co-author.

791
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:40,360
Well, I was about to go on sabbatical leave to Sweden and I thought, well, you know, maybe I could write in the evening working a lot during the day.

792
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:43,360
So it's not a completely crazy idea.

793
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:48,360
And I was talking to my colleague, Bob Becker, about this.

794
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,360
And he said, well, why don't you talk to Ken Van Holt?

795
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:54,360
He's talked about writing textbooks from time to time.

796
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,360
And Ken and I had taught graduate level courses together.

797
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:05,360
I knew he was extremely articulate, brilliant scientist, and he had a good sense of humor.

798
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:10,360
And also was much more of a physical biochemist than I am.

799
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,360
His PhD is actually in physical chemistry.

800
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,360
So I went and talked to Ken.

801
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:19,360
And he said, well, I'd have to be crazy to even think about something like this.

802
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,360
But yes, I am interested.

803
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:29,360
So we went down and visited the publisher and talked to our editor, the woman who would be our editor.

804
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:39,360
And she said that each of us should write a sample chapter, and we should write a chapter outline and a perspective sample chapter.

805
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,360
And she bought each of us a compact computer.

806
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:50,360
This is just before Macintosh came out, but there were slightly portable computers.

807
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:53,360
So I took one with me to Stockholm.

808
01:44:53,360 --> 01:45:00,360
And by the time I'd finished writing my sample chapter, I thought this is more work than I want to let myself in for.

809
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,360
But we sent the material in.

810
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:07,360
And in December, Diane called up.

811
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:10,360
She said the reviewers are like what we've written.

812
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,360
And they thought we ought to go ahead.

813
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,360
So they wanted to sign us for contract.

814
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,360
So I thought, oh, God, what do I do now?

815
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,360
And I called Ken.

816
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,360
And he said, oh, yeah, I said, I think it's terrific.

817
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,360
Let's go.

818
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,360
There was no alternative.

819
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,360
And we went ahead with it.

820
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:30,360
And many times during the writing process, I thought I was crazy to get involved in this.

821
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,360
If I could quit, I would.

822
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:39,360
But in retrospect, I'm glad that we stuck with it.

823
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:45,360
And it took a long time because it was 1984 that they first started talking to us about the book.

824
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:51,360
It was really 85 when we signed the contract.

825
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:58,360
And then I had a lot of things that got me behind schedule when I came back from sabbatical.

826
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:07,360
And we didn't really plan to end the work on an any kind of scheduled basis till spring or so of 1986.

827
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:12,360
But we had the first draft done maybe in spring of 88.

828
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,360
No, it must have been 80.

829
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:21,360
I don't remember the dates now because it took a year or so to produce the book after the chapter drafts were done.

830
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:27,360
So the whole thing was about almost a five year process.

831
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,360
And the subsequent additions were much easier.

832
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:39,360
Was it a difficult process to establish the point of view of the two authors that you're going to be writing the book?

833
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,360
Actually, that was the easiest part.

834
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:46,360
Ken and I split up responsibility for chapters.

835
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:49,360
Very easily we agreed to read each other's chapters.

836
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,360
I did most of the metabolism.

837
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,360
He did most of the structural biochemistry.

838
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:57,360
And we sort of split the molecular biology, the genetic biochemistry.

839
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:05,360
And the editors were very concerned about merging our prose styles.

840
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:08,360
I think we did pretty well.

841
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:13,360
Although now that I'm writing some for our fourth edition, which he's not involved in,

842
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,360
I'm writing some rewriting some chapters he wrote.

843
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:22,360
And I'm seeing some differences between his writing style and mine.

844
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:32,360
But the difficulty we had in the first edition was some pretty spirited arguments with our editors.

845
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,360
They kept a pretty heavy hand on us.

846
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:37,360
And we disagreed with them pretty frequently.

847
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,360
But they ended up being pretty good friends.

848
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:45,360
And we had a different editorial team each of the editions.

849
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:50,360
But that was where the energy came out.

850
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:54,360
But Ken and I had nothing but a good relationship.

851
01:47:54,360 --> 01:48:01,360
The one thing that was disappointing was that he spends almost half the year at his summer home in Woods Hole.

852
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,360
That he established when he was at the University of Illinois before he came here and that's chooses.

853
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:11,360
So it wasn't always a matter of just walking down the hall if I wanted to talk to him.

854
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:15,360
But he worked out pretty well.

855
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,360
It did pretty well.

856
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:23,360
I can't tell you how much the percentage of the market had captured.

857
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,360
But the publisher was very pleased.

858
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:29,360
In terms of the royalties, we were very pleased.

859
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:33,360
And I've been told by quite a few people.

860
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:41,360
I mean, this is not something I should be talking about, but I've been told that it's the most clearly written book on the market.

861
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:46,360
And I know it brought us a lot of attention.

862
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:51,360
I know when I was in sabbatical leave in Sweden, I got a call one day.

863
01:48:51,360 --> 01:49:01,360
And from someone at the University of Uppsala, they wanted me to come and meet with a group of their biochemistry teachers to tell them my thoughts about teaching biochemistry.

864
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:05,360
I gave a talk in South Africa a few years ago.

865
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:13,360
And that their biochemistry meeting and the students were coming up and wanting to be photographed with me because they had used our book.

866
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:17,360
So a lot of things happened that were very gratifying to the ego.

867
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:25,360
So from that standpoint, I guess our book was received well enough that it was worth the effort and worth the effort after the project.

868
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:32,360
I thought was dead after the third edition was done, that it was worth picking up for the fourth edition.

869
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:39,360
As you look back on your career, what are some of the things that your public says?

870
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:52,360
I guess the first thing is the fact that I trained 35 PhD students and most of them have done very well on their careers.

871
01:49:52,360 --> 01:50:03,360
And that's like being a parent and most of them stated enough contact that I had the feeling that I made a difference in their lives.

872
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:19,360
Another thing that I've been satisfied with is maintaining a balance of teaching and research through all the positions I've had because I always enjoyed teaching.

873
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,360
I'm pretty enthusiastic about the field.

874
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:30,360
I like to know what's going on in the field. I like to explain to others whether it's in writing or speaking.

875
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:48,360
And I like to set an example for colleagues who might be focused only on their research that you can be a successful research scientist and still maintain personal communication with students with colleagues.

876
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:54,360
With people in other departments on the campus that science can be a social activity.

877
01:50:54,360 --> 01:51:04,360
So I would say the breadth of interest and association that has something else I take satisfaction in.

878
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:13,360
And being able to say funded for years in a very difficult, increasingly difficult environment.

879
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:27,360
And the book, I mean that's a pretty big part of my life, put a pretty big strain in our family situation for a long time but now Kate is just as supportive about the whole thing as I am.

880
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:34,360
She likes it when I come home and tell her stories about the experience that we had.

881
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:39,360
So it's been a big plus also.

882
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,360
Is there anything that we miss that we should pass on?

883
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:54,360
Well, yeah, I guess there's always been the thought about what, again, parallel lies parallel universes.

884
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:58,360
What if I go on into medicine?

885
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:06,360
And that's hit it several times when I was in college trying to decide which way to go.

886
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:11,360
Of course, my father was a doctor. I thought the world of him.

887
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:17,360
And I talked and I catered and maybe we could go out of practice together.

888
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:21,360
And that could have been fun.

889
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,360
But dad was very good about not putting pressure on.

890
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:30,360
He said it was my decision whether to go on the science or medicine.

891
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:35,360
And you asked about the Reed College culture earlier.

892
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:38,360
And premeds were sort of frowned on as being grade lovers.

893
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:43,360
Even though Reed gave grades, but the students weren't told what the grades were.

894
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,360
And the idea was to make you less grade causes.

895
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:50,360
But the premeds were a little more narrow and they were interested.

896
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:59,360
And I saw there was something about the culture that the highest level of acceptance was the people that wanted to go on into university and college professors.

897
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,360
So that helped.

898
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,360
And then I was pointed in that direction.

899
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,360
But when I went to Arizona and started teaching medical students,

900
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:13,360
I realized that biochemistry in that context is a lot different.

901
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:27,360
And my father never actually conveyed to me the intellectual stimulation of medicine as a multi-departmental scientific activity.

902
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,360
It was partly that he was in practice.

903
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:39,360
He was an internist, but a lot of his patients did have routine troubles that didn't give him much stimulation.

904
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,360
So he didn't convey that part of it.

905
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:48,360
But once I had to learn to teach biochemistry in a way that medical students would accept.

906
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:56,360
And once I started interacting with him, the college I realized that medicine is a lot different from what I thought it was.

907
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:02,360
And so at some point after I'd been there a few years, early seventies,

908
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:13,360
I read that the University of Miami had created a fast track MD program for PhDs in the biomedical sciences.

909
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:17,360
You could finish a MD degree in a year and a half to two years.

910
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,360
I was pretty interested in this.

911
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:21,360
So I applied for it.

912
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,360
It was accepted.

913
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,360
And then I went to talk to the department chairman.

914
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:33,360
The idea being that one of the years I could get partial support by being on sabbatical leave.

915
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,360
And then we'd use our own resources for the rest.

916
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:43,360
And when I told him about it, he looks though he'd been kicked in the stomach.

917
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:48,360
And then he talked to my colleagues, which I always felt was improper.

918
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,360
I thought that my conversation was just one on one.

919
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:57,360
But after a week, he said that the department had decided they really didn't want me to do this.

920
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:01,360
Well, obviously I could have done it anyway, but I would have had to resign.

921
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:04,360
I could have resigned.

922
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:06,360
You know, I thought it over.

923
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,360
And by that time our children were date and 10.

924
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:12,360
We were pretty well settled and two son.

925
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:15,360
And there wasn't any, and I enjoyed what I was doing.

926
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:21,360
There wasn't any real, there wasn't any reason that I had to do this.

927
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:27,360
But I've always wondered what it would have been like if I had a current medicine.

928
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,360
Would I have gone into medical research?

929
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:33,360
Or would I have been a primary in practice?

930
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,360
Would I have gotten the intellectual stimulation?

931
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,360
Would I have enjoyed the kind of breadth of awareness of what's happening?

932
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,360
Cutting edge science and all the rest of it.

933
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,360
It'd be nice if you could live too long.

934
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:48,360
But that's something I just have to live with, I guess.

935
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:58,360
So obviously we're also very proud of our two children, Lawrence, who was, as I said, born very shortly after our marriage.

936
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:02,360
And then Anne was born a couple of years later.

937
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:08,360
Lawrence ended up going to the University of Washington for a PhD in biochemistry.

938
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:11,360
He was in the same department I was.

939
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,360
And the department had changed a lot since then.

940
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:18,360
He's now out of science, but he got a great start to his career.

941
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:21,360
He did a postdoc in Sweden, and then a second postdoc in the Sock Institute.

942
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:25,360
And he did a piece of work that made him quite well known.

943
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:32,360
He had four excellent faculty offers, and he was an assistant professor at the University of Michigan for several years.

944
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:38,360
And he had an epiphany, and now he's a teacher in the Waldorf school system.

945
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,360
And we'll go into detail about that.

946
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:47,360
But he is much happier doing that than he ever was as a university faculty member.

947
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:54,360
And our daughter graduated from Oregon State with a degree in psychology and no clue to what she wanted to do.

948
01:56:54,360 --> 01:57:07,360
And she happened to talk to a naval recruiter on campus, and ended up going to naval officer candidate school after she graduated, and becoming an ensign.

949
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:17,360
And she did very well in the Navy, but she ended up secretly getting married to an enlisted man under her command.

950
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:21,360
And that was a no-no on the Navy, and when they found out they were both in trouble.

951
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:28,360
And again, making a long story short, they both left the Navy, and the Ann was in the reserve.

952
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:33,360
She got promoted in the reserve, so she was in good standing as far as the Navy was concerned.

953
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:40,360
But they had two children, and she was basically soccer mom until her two daughters were in college.

954
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:47,360
And she went back and got a degree as a paralegal assistant, so she was working in that field.

955
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,360
So both of our children are doing things.

956
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,360
They enjoy a great deal.

957
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,360
Each of them has two children who have done very well.

958
01:57:54,360 --> 01:58:01,360
And so that's something that Kate and I can look at with some satisfaction also.
