1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,179
Okay, Al, if you could please introduce yourself with your name in today's date and

2
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:09,759
our location. I'm Albert C. Parr, we're at our home in

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,000
Gresham, working on these two at Avenue and the date date I believe is the 18th,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,879
18th of June 2014. Terrific. Well, we'll start at the beginning. You were born in,

5
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,679
is it to Lee, Utah? To Iowa, they call it to Utah. Yeah. And so what was your family doing there?

6
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,920
Okay, my dad was working in the copper mines and a big army depot at the

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,100
12th, Ordnance depot during World War II. And after the war ended, decided he wanted to

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,359
leave Utah and move up to Oregon where his brother was, family was in

9
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,000
Rosbury. So we moved to Rosbury, I think in 1946 something like that,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,320
1946 or early 1947, and that's why I went to all my schooling and grew up there in

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,079
in Rosbury. Did you have siblings? Yes, I have one brother, an older brother

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,420
and an assistant that's four years younger. And they both lived in the state.

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,439
My sister lives in Canberra, my brother lives in Lake Grover Lake, I'll swiggle.

14
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,200
So your dad was in the copper mines originally, but I understand he was in the forest

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,400
products industry. Yeah, he worked in the saw mills and plywood mills and the

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Rosbury area and eventually ran a film station for a while and some other

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,760
things just sort of retired as a handyman and mechanic. It was a place there in

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,900
Rosbury. Growing up in Rosbury, did you have any, do you have memories of the

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,320
temper culture at that time? Yeah, there was a lot of, you know, that's what made

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,560
the world hum down there. And in those days, they were still giving a lot of those

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,719
first growth trees and it'd be Douglas Firswood. You take up a whole logging truck

22
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,439
the diameter would be and you'd see those coming down the road and the road is

23
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,539
really very primitive up in the mountains. There's a lot of them are at least gravel

24
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,780
not paid, but it was very primitive. But that was a, that was almost

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,680
excuse to be it. There's also a big farming industry in Rosbury in the garden

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,840
valley, a vegetable farming, can't load beans, that sort of thing. There were a lot of

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,439
less kids in junior high school, high school work in the farms and the in the

28
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,439
valleys there and in the Rosbury area. In fact that's why I started working in

29
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,099
the farming areas to save up money to go to Oregon State. So what, what kinds of

30
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,400
jobs did you do? Well I started the, you know, high school picking beans, the

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,439
pole beans and then eventually you got a, that was by a profound sort of job and

32
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,879
then eventually I got a job by the hour, sort of an overseer of that and also

33
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,680
the, and the swimming summers and running in Camel fields. And the guy worked

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,400
for about 25 acres of Camel open, tomatoes and strawberries and that sort of

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,280
thing and I would work all from, you know, spring on through the late summer

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,960
where we fall after school and on the weekends for the farmers. Was there much

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,800
migrant labor in the area at that time? Not much at all, very, very little. In fact

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,359
that's why the school, they used to run the school buses downtown and all

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
kids have to work in the fields and I don't think that's done anymore. I think

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
the children don't want to work out in the hot sun, but that's what it used to be

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,120
done. Back in the 50s and 60s and then before that it was, getting it

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,080
to get yourself into the school and the school buses load up and go to the

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
various bean fields and the work all day they bring you back to the school and

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,120
get yourself home somehow. When do you remember about your dad's work in the

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,520
sun? What was the typical work experience like for him? It was very hard work

46
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,759
and of course the mills were not air conditioned or heated or any of that

47
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,719
nature and so it was hard, it was hard dirty work and not the safest thing in

48
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,400
those days either, but it was very labor intensive. All the work was done by hand

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,719
and of course power saws that sort of thing, but you walk into a modern plywood

50
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,759
mill, there's very few people and it's all automated, but most days

51
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:04,479
everything was done by hand, including making the plywood sheet layer by layer.

52
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,639
Like I had a job one summer after in college working in a plywood mill

53
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,359
that was my job to make the plywood. It started out with the big flat piece,

54
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,599
a four-bed piece and put the machine just spit out glued cross pieces to

55
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:24,000
even slap those down some water and then flop another the sheets on and

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,719
physically built the piece of plywood with your hands and stacked them up with

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,040
put them in a big hot press and press them and started another batch, but it was

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,080
all hand labor you see, including the glued pieces and all parts of the

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,080
process were had so they employed a lot of people compared to what now they do.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,960
Sounds a little repetitious. Yeah, it's boring but it was good money for kid

61
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:58,279
most day. How was your mother, what was her background? She was a school teacher and

62
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,359
so since we moved to Rosberg she got a job in looking glass, sort of teaching

63
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,439
there in looking glass and would go out there every day during the school year

64
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,439
and so we were very young so we were we'd often have babysitters and that sort

65
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,199
of thing and then eventually she moved to the Rosberg school system and retired

66
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,799
for 30 years or whatever. How was Rosberg growing up for you? I loved it

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,920
it was a you know safe place to be and had a lot of friends there still do so

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,120
have my road road contacts and we I liked it the weather was nice and it's

69
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,040
you know lovely place to live and of course a small town but I have very fond

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,639
memories of it. Really great place schools were good and so everything did

71
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,920
everything to recommend it in my mind. What were your hobbies as a boy what did you

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,800
do for fun? I was pretty busy working we lived on a small farm so we had

73
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,759
a lot of animals that always had pigs and chickens and now getting a cow on a

74
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,840
steer and that sort of thing so busy with that sort of thing and then hobbies

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,200
as I got older was cars got real interested in hot rod racing and a bunch of

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,879
was you know running these hot rods you'd see back in the 50s and drag race on

77
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,879
the on the roads and that sort of thing. That had a good time but it was it was

78
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,279
entertaining and it was a nice place to grow up. How about your experience at

79
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,480
school? The roastmen had good schools in those days and I've presumably still

80
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,319
do and so it was I learned a lot I was a for a few years for a few years of my

81
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,480
school and I didn't take schooling very seriously and I you know got by but and

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,240
nothing to nothing to brag about academic excellence but by the time I got to

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,840
high school and later on and I started taking school more seriously and

84
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,680
worked on getting good grades and that sort of thing but again they they were

85
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,600
very tolerant and I was active in student government in high school and so on

86
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,199
so I had a good time I enjoyed I look back with the high school with great

87
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,040
fondness I saw a lot of friends from from the Roosevelt graduating class and

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,220
I see them and I was just talking to one on the phone this morning it'll

89
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,580
be somebody from from Roseburg so you know your friendship lasted you know it

90
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,000
started last the last the lifetime you know from high school experience. They

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,300
seem education was an emphasis in your family. Yes I heard from the time I was

92
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,160
very small that you want to work hard so you can go to college and my dad

93
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,620
always say so you don't have to work in the mills like I have to work and what you

94
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,600
work in the mills you could see what he met and so what it was a good

95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,520
impetus working in the mills and in hard labor on the farms that there might

96
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,720
be a better career perhaps more in terms of ease but also security because the

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
mills are always having strikes where there was before the union really got

98
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,800
strong and people get laid off and it was that it was not the most secure

99
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,520
environment so a lot of anxiety but for my father and the other parents as well

100
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:13,000
because of the changing nature of the scene in terms of the the mills and

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,079
who was oh who won't just when they buy some mills and everybody get fired and

102
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:23,159
so on and I could understand why my father was always apprehensive it was a

103
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:30,560
uncertain time. How did you develop your interest in science? I was always

104
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,759
fairly good at it always a math and then science things always came easy to me

105
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:40,639
it's just one of my buildings and I did well at it and I just got I was always

106
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,519
interested in how things work I built radios from time I was you know like a

107
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,200
teenager and you can't interest in radios not letting the interest you know

108
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,879
in physics and electronics and I always had that interest in high school and when

109
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,240
I went on to college that was the first thing I thought about it as having a

110
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,120
major in terms of physics and math so it's just I think things sort of selects

111
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,000
you by your abilities some people have great musical skills and other kinds of

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,159
skills language skills and there's some of us who have math and science skills

113
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,840
it just attributes and interest to and a firm believer in that there's

114
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,720
dispositions and characteristics of people that a lot of them to succeed because

115
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,160
some people no matter how hard they work have a very difficult time with mathematics

116
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,240
I would see that when I was teaching and there wasn't that they were you know

117
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,639
necessarily stupid people and they got that nature just they didn't have those

118
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,360
those particular abilities in perhaps interest with abilities and so people

119
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,840
tend to end up I think in things if they're going to be successful that they

120
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,800
have good abilities like that's what worked out for me and you know was there

121
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,440
anybody who during your high school time was a mentor for you or somebody

122
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,480
who got interested in these things or did it sort of my marriage from within

123
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,240
I had a series of very good science teachers in high school physics teachers

124
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,920
and chemistry teachers and math teachers I might add that always encouraged and

125
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,680
encouraged the students and then kept you on the straight now in terms of

126
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,640
the learning did a good job so I think the I had a benefit of a bunch of good

127
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,680
teachers most of the more veterans from World War II that was the ones I can

128
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,560
remember that had gotten to school in the GI building in one education they

129
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,920
were they were really excellent teachers a lot of benefit to us of students we went

130
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,960
to Oregon State College beginning in 1960 how did you decide to go to OSC? I had

131
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:53,720
a scholarship from the maybe and was in our TC scholarship and that was the place

132
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,040
that had that that program and also I wanted to major in a science program

133
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,840
so it was a natural choice and they had the in our OTC scholarship as well so

134
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,700
it was a confluence of events and interest as well as for this a little

135
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:17,160
scholarship aid was. Were you in in our OTC in high school? No no not at all but

136
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,120
there was one of those exams you take and you selected and so on I

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,679
know it was a competitive thing so that was part of your experience then in

138
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,720
college was being in the energy. In OTC? Yes yes as I was in that for two and a

139
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,659
half years then I decided that it would be better for me to continue in science

140
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:44,039
further than continue as a naval officer and a disenroll from that program just

141
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,600
used to sit my time in the science program. What did that program entail for

142
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,720
the Navy program? That would entail the summer cruises. After your freshman

143
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,000
year you went on the camp pedal and in some other places then after the

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,139
sophomore year we went to Texas for a while Air Force based on the

145
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,840
Corpus Christi and then another month or so at San Diego and so it's good

146
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,320
to realize experience I really think well those experiences in the Navy in the

147
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,760
summer programs and if I had stayed in the program the third year after your

148
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,060
junior year you'd be going to onboard a ship. Some sort of capacity but I

149
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,000
never went that far. I put some time in my junior year. Was there training

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,160
during the school year? Yes to the regular OTC program I think it was you had

151
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,280
to regular class three times a week then one day there was a drill where

152
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,159
you had to read out and it was a marching outside down there all those

153
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,179
fields or other buildings was down there the quons of that building really. It's

154
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,679
still the same building that it was like down there by the Colosseum and then

155
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,639
so forth. It was the same building that and those were all World War II

156
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,079
Quonset Huston so it's amazing it's still standing with all those fields

157
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,279
were all vacant there there's not a lot of the development that's we'd be out

158
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,319
there marching endlessly it's same. Yeah yeah there used to be quite a few

159
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,400
those quonset ads on campus I'm sure you saw. Yeah well what do you remember

160
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,660
about you sort of your first impressions of college and of Corralis? I liked it

161
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,320
I was I got there I was selected to go into some sort of they were trying some

162
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,840
living living living arrangements programs and they were also getting started

163
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,080
what they called an honors program at that time and I was enrolled in that

164
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,360
and they put people in that honors program as your freshman the whole

165
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,440
four on the first four Cawthorn Hall I believe. He was Cawthorn Hall. The whole

166
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,080
first four were people that were chosen for this honors program and they

167
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,360
encourage extra cultural activities and they had advisors and so forth and it

168
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,320
was pretty much a pretty nice bunch of fellows who had you know well fairly

169
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,920
successful in high school and they were then selected for this honors program

170
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
arrangement I don't know if they still do that or not I have an idea but it was

171
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,120
I was an introductory program so the people that we were my roommates and then

172
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,980
the people and the hall were pre-selected out by by someone in the university

173
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,120
as a part of this honors program to test to have the better students in one

174
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,780
location the people they perceive to be better students really ultimately turned

175
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,520
out or not I don't know but that was that was the idea of the time and there was

176
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,480
extra curriculum activities as well. Yeah and then the honor program you took an

177
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,379
addition to your regular courses there was at least one seminar a week of

178
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,920
you know small small bunch of people even sometimes one-on-one with one of

179
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,440
the professors working on projects. I found that very beneficial I worked with

180
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
biology botany and the botany professor once in physics professors and

181
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,320
entomology so it was it was an interesting time and did that every year for your

182
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,080
whole four years and then you would when you graduated you get an honors

183
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,160
designation on your diploma. Interesting see you're helping assist with

184
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,080
their research. Yeah you would do and then do little projects on your own yeah

185
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,200
and it was it was it was it was always sort of interesting and then just talk

186
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,600
about you know their field of research and then trying to learn a little bit

187
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,320
a little bit about it was a broadening experience but you got to work sort of

188
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,520
one-on-one with with the faculty members or in some cases one of my physics

189
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,400
program was working with a senior graduate student but coming once a twice a

190
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,120
week and we were working on on projects and the physics program. Yeah that's

191
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm interested to hear you talk about this though there was I've known that

192
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,200
honors program apparently it started right around when you started it was

193
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,760
cut as a result of all at major five in the early 90s and then was replaced by

194
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,960
the University Honors College which came about five years later it sounds like

195
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,519
it's a little different yeah but your experience was yeah it was a you they

196
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,139
they in some of the classes are segregated in terms you know the people in the

197
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,600
honors program but by and large you just meshed with with everybody else and

198
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,960
did these extra things that with the seminars you know one or three are

199
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,360
similar credit course and get credit for that as well. It was a main

200
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,440
experience was being able to work with one-on-one with a with a research or

201
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,520
some sort of an extraordinary areas so it was a very beneficial. So when you went

202
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,120
to college is you have a sense of what you wanted to do in terms of your studies

203
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
because as a turn of that you took it I've looked at your academic records you

204
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,280
took a lot of classes and to get two degrees in four years was that your plan

205
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,360
from the beginning? I sort of liked it because I was the math and the physics

206
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,480
were happened to be easy for me and the things that caused me trouble were the

207
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,240
foreign language requirements that you know that was really hard for me that's

208
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,559
been probably more time on French when I was taking it then I then I did on

209
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,160
the physics courses just different abilities but no I just really liked

210
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,880
the physics courses I took as much as I could now select the math courses but I'd

211
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,759
taken a lot of math in high school I really liked it and they had some good

212
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,720
professors too in both departments it was a fun and fun environment so I look

213
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,200
back on my days both at undergraduate and graduate school with great

214
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,120
fondness because I enjoyed it and it was hard work and so forth it was a really

215
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,559
nice time you were doing something you really wanted to do and able to do and

216
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,519
sort of free from the necessities that happened to make a living otherwise and

217
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,519
work in a workplace and so on it was a time of your life and a pro-long time in my

218
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,519
case because I went on to graduate school where you were doing exactly what you

219
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,559
wanted to do and that's a that's a real good feeling it's very very good for the

220
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,480
soul did you have a sense of a particular specialty within math and physics at

221
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,400
that point in your life no I did not know but then in fact the curriculum was

222
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,680
sort of everybody took the same thing there were a few electors like in physics

223
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,279
you could take it maybe into meteorology or something of that nature or ocean

224
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,400
sciences was getting started back that some people would maybe take a few of that

225
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,800
but by large the physics curriculum was pretty well fixed and since I was

226
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,440
getting a math major too I didn't have a lot of a slop I had to take the required

227
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,200
courses and to fill the the social science requirements as well I think that

228
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,480
PE requirements in those days too that you had to take some of your classes

229
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,680
yeah I don't know if it was still current when you were in school and you

230
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,880
used to have to learn how to swim in order to graduate yeah and that was that

231
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,880
you had to take a swimming course and those days and I always thought it was

232
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,240
awful the no swimming suits you swam nude and I thought that was just

233
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,600
just a trotious I mean there's no earthly sense in it there was just some

234
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,400
very peculiar people running the swim program in the athletic department I

235
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,080
think that was my that was always my opinion just strange folks you're not the

236
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,839
first person to say that to me but were there any professors that made a

237
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,799
particular impact upon you you can think of yeah I like the entomology

238
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,279
professor I worked with John Latin I believe was the same was was very influential

239
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,399
got me interested in in philosophy of philosophy of science and a whole range of

240
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:44,480
things other than learning a very little about entomology but a little bit and

241
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,519
we had some good professors in the physics department to enjoy that a great

242
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,240
deal they were they were good because they were student focused and he really

243
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,839
got a chance to have a lot of experiences directly with the teachers yeah Latin

244
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,680
also was a book lecture oh I didn't know that at the time yeah we have a

245
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:11,160
Latin book collection did you work while you were in school yeah a sum the

246
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,200
NRTC program kept kept pretty busy but also later on helped by grading

247
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,840
papers and and that sort of thing for both the math department and the physics

248
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,759
department and that was a small amount of money but it actually helped but

249
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,240
primarily and then being grading papers is acting as sort of an assistant to

250
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,000
some professor you know and that sort of thing I didn't you know working a

251
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,880
restaurant or any that sort of thing well and when you were studying physics

252
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,839
especially I'm interested in knowing about the technologies that were

253
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:50,680
important to students at that point well we we had you know the technology of the

254
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,839
fifties in the early sixties right and so there were there were a lot of

255
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,160
old hula packer and tectonics measuring equipment that sort of thing and

256
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,519
the optic stuff was you know all the classical optics material and a lot of

257
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,440
that's probably still still the same because things like optics haven't the

258
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,319
introduction of the laser some of that technology haven't changed that much so

259
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,720
the lenses and that sort of thing you know probably the same knowledge as a

260
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,319
word that were then and they had I think while equipped laboratories and for

261
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:25,039
the time and it was it was good yeah I'm always interested in knowing about

262
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,279
the era before computers and computers we know anyway yeah well there was none

263
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,920
of that then the university had a computer then and it was

264
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,400
I started to take a computer course was I always thought this was sort of funny

265
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,240
and I showed up in this class and turns out most the other people already knew

266
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,640
what they were doing and you know and so the professor was talking to them

267
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,000
somebody like me was just out the lunch eventually I just quit the course

268
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,759
you know they need you to tell you where the computer was and how you did

269
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:57,920
anything they just started talking about a bunch of stuff that they were you know

270
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,880
more advanced it wasn't an introductory course at all which is what it was a

271
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,760
ledge to be and so it was it was sort of a bad experience quite frankly my

272
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,800
introduction to computers and they had something to say at that time I have

273
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,200
no idea what it was I never personally sought because I got out of the

274
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,920
business and then really get started into computers till later in graduate

275
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,480
school in very late in graduate school and then I became a talk for a few

276
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,960
years in Alabama we started automating some some of our equipment then but it

277
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,079
was still back in those those they're like in the 60s it was still calotypes not

278
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:44,400
sort of console it was a modems and very slow I mean people just wouldn't

279
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,599
recognize it now they wouldn't have the patience for it did you so you lived

280
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,160
in a dorm initially did you stay in the dorms all four years or no I didn't I

281
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,600
that I I didn't really like the dorms because they're sort of noisy and I'm

282
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,680
the sort of person I really have to have a sort of quiet and it's a little

283
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,560
solitude and the dorms are always very very noisy so the second year I in a

284
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:16,320
friend found an apartment over by the SAE house it's a church that's a church

285
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,400
said it won't be able to story house they rented out parts of it for students so

286
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,320
my friend and I moved in moved in there and at that time that wasn't that

287
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,160
wasn't really allowed I mean you had an undergraduate who was supposed to live

288
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,800
in student approved housing well this wasn't student approved housing we

289
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,320
just moved in there but eventually the dean caught up with us the dean of

290
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,080
man send us letters which we ignored and so forth but if it came over and not

291
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,839
on the door I don't remember his name but he was a very nice man and we talked

292
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,240
to him a while I told him I just you know we liked it there and it was and I was

293
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,639
getting good grades and being successful so it wasn't like we were and saved with

294
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:07,119
my roommate we're flunking out of school something it was actually being quite

295
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,559
successful as a living arrangement but so he blesses heart he went next door

296
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,039
who graduated student and his wife were living who I didn't know and got them to

297
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,240
sign that they would be your Procters or whatever they called it signed it that

298
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,839
they would keep an eye on us and so it became legitimate housing and I hadn't

299
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:33,000
realized that it was a process to turn a living situation to university

300
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,200
recognized but then that was the end of that never heard more about it and I stayed

301
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,759
there for the next two years and the third year we up I finally we lived a

302
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,119
roommate and I lived in a place called Kravals Towers or something like that

303
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,280
it was a high-rise building at that time in Portland area I mean then in the

304
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,080
Kravals area and that was that was that was fine too but that first one was a

305
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,480
sophomore when we ran into the dean that that's having a little concern but

306
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,920
you know I was trying to do what I thought was best for me and turned out fine

307
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,220
with that point this is still true to some degree but at that point the

308
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,800
Greek system was very big on campus and I'm wondering what it was like to

309
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,779
not be part of that to have try to have a social life but not necessarily

310
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:24,720
the engage with the Greek system we need you to engage with it. Not much I had

311
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,460
some friends over in fraternity in fact I met some of the fellows that lived

312
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,200
across the street at the SAE house and they were all fine we got long fine

313
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,639
there's no problems and we since I had been doing a double major in

314
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:39,799
healthful so working I didn't have a lot of time for socializing and I'm not

315
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,779
in most days I didn't think much of party and carrying on I like

316
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:49,059
I emphasize I liked it quite so I could get my work done so I never really

317
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,579
thought about that the fraternities and they were a little more expensive too I

318
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,019
think to live because by sharing an apartment the rim was relatively small

319
00:25:56,019 --> 00:26:01,059
another kind of shared the rent and you did a lot of cooking in this food

320
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:08,299
preparation and it was really fairly inexpensive I would I would budget about

321
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,779
a thousand dollars maybe eleven hundred dollars a year to go to work in

322
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:18,000
state and with a little judicious spending and care you could make almost

323
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,740
out of mountain in a summary the working on the farms or plywood mill or a

324
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,359
sawmill or something like that nature and so you could quite easily work your

325
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,700
way through school of course I had a scholarship through the first two and a

326
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,740
half years that paid the tuition and I think they gave us $50 a month for

327
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,339
living to as part of that Navy program so it was you know small stipend and so

328
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,440
the financial aspects of going to college in the in the in the 60s and so

329
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,600
earlier two were just not burdensome almost anybody with a will could could

330
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,900
go to any school that they wanted whether it was you know Oregon University of

331
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,860
Oregon or Oregon State or you know Southern Oregon College in any school because

332
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,740
you could work your way fairly straightforward now I think that's not quite

333
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,779
probable likely not possible did you have any major extracurricular activities

334
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,660
that you did during during college not much except the that play you know

335
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,700
tennis and things like this with with friends but I didn't during a lot of

336
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,980
clubs or anything of that nature because you know it's pretty busy and focus on

337
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,140
my my activities but a lot of friends we did think would often you know have

338
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,900
your Friday night out at the bar down there the peacock whatever is one was

339
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,660
bars down there and have a good time and that was it but I didn't join I didn't

340
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:46,220
during a lot of clubs or anything of that nature to any particular hangout

341
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:54,900
besides the peacock not really but of course everybody you know would have a few

342
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,640
beers on their own strictly if you got away to get it even though it's not

343
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,700
not that legal in my respect but the students as always are

344
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,040
inner pricing and was never a problem why don't I ask you about a few events

345
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,740
that happened at Oregon State when you were there the first one in 1961

346
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,660
Oregon State College became Oregon State University that made much of an

347
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,720
impact on you to be memory of that I have remember and the people there

348
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,620
thought it was a big deal I remember everybody being enthused about it because I

349
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:33,440
guess and a lot of people's minds the the name university has more prestige

350
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,140
and meaning than college and I guess it does personally at that time I I

351
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,980
didn't care that much as I recall because you know I had known as Oregon State

352
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,860
College OSC you know I was a high plus where I applied it didn't mean a lot to me

353
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:55,580
in terms of a bit of things because whether degree whether your degree said

354
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,720
Oregon State College or State University to me it didn't mean very much but

355
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,419
you know to some people I and I can understand it it did mean a lot to them

356
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,819
because I think in the in the academic hierarchy being called a university is

357
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:16,619
more meaningful than you know college it's it's more restricted term doesn't

358
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,579
imply the research and graduate programs and so forth that you you think of

359
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:26,419
in terms of the university and I think that was that was the goal of course in

360
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:33,619
October of 1962 is the Columbus Day Storm you remember that vaguely yeah and you

361
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:40,000
know it's a bad storm and and I didn't affect me in any way you know

362
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,059
directly I mean we didn't lose any of our home or any of that nature either in

363
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,779
privilege or like the parents rose we didn't have any problems and so I did

364
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:57,519
it didn't drastically drastically affect me in any way I don't get it you're a

365
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,019
big football fan but Terry Baker won the highest trophy in 1962 as well do you

366
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:05,819
remember much hoopla or surrounding that oh yeah there was a lot of hoopla and he

367
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:09,099
was a great athlete because he was a he started the best school the best school

368
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,640
as well and yeah I didn't know in person of course but he was he was famous in

369
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,040
his own time and I used to go to football games and they I think the students got

370
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,220
in you know freer or or almost nothing if there was it was a game you know

371
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,860
it's not otherwise engaged I try to get down to watch right I enjoy football

372
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,100
it's the one sport I do care for right not really a basketball or baseball fan

373
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:41,940
that much but I do like football and so I go some of the games but in all the

374
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:48,220
hoopla associated with it so I enjoy the athletic teams well what was your

375
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,980
sense of corralis at the time that somewhat smaller place and it is now

376
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:59,260
obviously any particular relationship with the town I like corbalis it was

377
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:05,299
the the people were friendly and nice and there there wasn't a crime to speak

378
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:11,259
of and you know I'd read my bicycle outside in my house or the apartment where I

379
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:16,900
lived I never had a stolen and this sort of thing and never had a stolen from

380
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,579
the building or anything like that so yeah I enjoy I have no negative memories of

381
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:26,339
it at all of course the lovely campus I always thought Oregon State had a truly

382
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,380
lovely campus in the spring when everything's in bloom and the landscaping is

383
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,500
it's really really nice and in those days they didn't have all those cut and

384
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,820
streets all the streets went through and you didn't have all the limited access

385
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,260
that you have now and but parking was critical I mean it was not easy when I

386
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,940
I lived my part I got an apartment system problem with that in the dorm you

387
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,780
had to park way down there by pass the tennis courts by the call seam and walk

388
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:57,139
across the fields and so forth there was no parking close by so it was

389
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:01,720
inconvenient for some of the cars in those days but yeah it was I like I like

390
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,139
corbalis it's a lovely little town and it's certainly a nicer place to live

391
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:12,379
than what I ended up going to grad school in South Chicago I mean night and day

392
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:18,420
I'm sure yeah I'm sure of that well that brings us to the sort of the next

393
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,400
section of your life you graduated in 1964 from Oregon State how did you

394
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,500
decide what you're going to do next well I had decided back in my junior year

395
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,300
when I got out of the Navy that out of the NROTC program that I wanted to go on

396
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:40,740
to get a degree of PhD in physics and do research and work at research

397
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,900
last but I really liked that and so I applied to graduate school and I was

398
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,940
interested in that after getting away from the West Coast so I applied to the

399
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,440
University of Chicago and a couple schools out of West here I remember I

400
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,640
Berkeley and University of Washington and I got accepted by the University of

401
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:09,860
Chicago and they offered me a research fellowship and an assistantship so that

402
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,220
covered the education of course they paid the tuition to so I was able to go

403
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,019
to the University of Chicago you know actually by the time I finished I was saved up

404
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:25,220
a little money in fact that's where I met my wife too as a Chicago in 1966 so

405
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,779
it was it was an employee that chose Chicago's one of the reasons it's a good

406
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:37,100
school and the financial aid package was very generous I thought and it was a

407
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,299
different part of the country it was interesting to move out to another part

408
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,419
of the country what's certainly different it was a real lesson to me never

409
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,899
having been to Chicago I didn't interview the school or anything like that I got

410
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:53,419
accepted and I had an old 57 Dodge station wagon at the time I loaded up all

411
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:59,259
my stuff and drove across Montana and on down into Chicago and right there

412
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:02,180
and made one or you know I was going to survive because it's a very different

413
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,539
environment yeah tell me about that transition you're living in a major city living

414
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,579
in a I have a rough part of a major city yeah it was the South

415
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:20,420
Chicago was in a transition from a widely white Polish Irish community to

416
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,259
primarily black or African American and then there was all those problems

417
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:29,739
associated with that in terms of you know the cultural clashes and so you

418
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:35,139
would see that frequently and a lot of you know racism on on both sides

419
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:42,339
particularly as as as the population and population profile demographic

420
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:47,500
change in these neighborhoods there was a lot of trouble in people's minds

421
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,460
anyhow and so it was it was an interesting the interesting things of course

422
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:57,059
something you'd not exposed to an organ at all you never had the idea and so

423
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:01,179
was it from a town like Corvallis where there's very few minorities at

424
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:06,139
least at that time go to Chicago or in South Chicago you know somebody like me

425
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:11,980
a white person was a minority and it was it was a real experience and it gives

426
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,219
you perspective on how minorities in this country the kinds of perceptions

427
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:22,619
they must have and some of their some of their perplexions I guess what

428
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,980
causes trouble and anxieties but it's a it's a good lesson I think for

429
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,860
everybody yeah well the university you're into it was a world-class

430
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:37,019
university in the University of Chicago very high-powered in the sciences tell me

431
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:41,699
a little bit about that atmosphere that you you came into at that point it was

432
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:47,019
it was it was it was very competitive I mean the students were all you know

433
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:53,300
you know very very bright I remember the chairman told me that everybody

434
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:00,140
in the class had GRE scores and the 98 percentile above and and they were all

435
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,980
really really successful successful students it was very competitive fortunately

436
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,420
I my background at Oregon State sort of mean good said I had no problems with

437
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:16,820
the academics and work at that Chicago and it went well and made the normal

438
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,340
course of events and graduated in six seven years with a PhD it was a

439
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:28,180
typical time for physics in those days at Chicago I think it's some of the

440
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:34,980
other majors take it was less time but so I graduated in the early 1970

441
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:41,660
I want to ask you about a couple people that were there I believe when you

442
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,700
were there that are big names the first is an Indian fellow Superb onion

443
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,860
Chandra Shikar absolutely he's a great professor I had him for a couple of

444
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:59,840
classes actually and statistical physics and and atomic molecular physics quantum

445
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,059
mechanics advanced quantum mechanics and he was a brilliant teacher and he would

446
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,980
come in and just start his lecture and hit perfect handwriting on the board

447
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,780
is this was the days of chalkboards none of this stuff and no overhead

448
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,579
projections thing that sort of thing with the classical blackboards we cite them

449
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:23,500
up and down fill up a room with that and he would start precisely on time and

450
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:30,019
then since and finish precisely on time noise with a coherent message and as

451
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,940
last few minutes would be a summary and then you could write all the summaries

452
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,900
down on your notes and then you'd you'd have the important elements of

453
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,299
the conversation and the talk so he's a brilliant professor really a nice

454
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,940
person a chemist Robert Mulligan won the Nobel Prize in 1966 while you were

455
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,860
there do you remember that yes and I knew a new Robert Mulligan he was in the

456
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,900
same building as well I did my research and I would see him frequently he was a

457
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,900
he was an interesting man a brilliant brilliant chemist physicist and a

458
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,460
particular physics and a whole bunch of students and then post-docs he had a

459
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,740
large enterprise in those days doing spectroscopes being theoretical

460
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,099
theoretical physics and so on but he was a real quiet man and all he was

461
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:24,659
already old by the time I got to know him and I didn't have any classes from him

462
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:29,179
but he didn't teach much he was all just a hundred percent research and of course

463
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:34,460
traveling a lot because he was a world famous but he had a dozens of people

464
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,920
working in his laboratories and then a Ryerson Hall at the University of

465
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,320
Cognizatives well it sounds like a tremendously enriching environment I'm

466
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,480
do you tell me about this or the progression of your of your academic courses

467
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,360
there your research time yeah I work I had my for shoot up there and then the

468
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,440
fall of 64 I was assigned to work for a professor Mark Ingraham who did

469
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,519
mass spectrometry and chemical physics and various sorts of

470
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:12,099
instrumentations look at properties of the top of the molecular systems and I

471
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:16,900
worked in his lab as a research assistant for the first couple years and in

472
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,759
Chicago they had you had to take regular take physics courses and then think of

473
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,480
that nature as well as preparing for what they call an entrance exam or the

474
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,840
the candidate exam you usually took that at the start of your in the fall of

475
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:38,640
your second year that was a very very hard test the qualifier and so the first

476
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,519
year graduate students would spend huge amounts of time studying old tests and

477
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,200
problems because it was a three-day test you know with all problems I mean it

478
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,800
was none of this motor will guess that was all problems to solve and in all

479
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,280
areas of physics and so you had to be well prepared and so on fortunately I

480
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,519
passed that the first time through and I was able to get my research started and

481
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:09,920
that was a also a test which a lot of a lot of people didn't make it the first

482
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,960
time they'd have to take away six months or year and take it again and then

483
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,920
a lot that some people just left it was so daunting that they just left but

484
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,240
that's like a lot of universities have those sort of qualified exams and it's

485
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,920
it's a it's a hurdle at all all people studying for an advanced degree have to

486
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,720
overcome but it was it was taxing it occupied each month your time and you

487
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,720
just study it and then to learn the material to pass those exams it was rewarding

488
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,039
because there's a focus of your attention and you really did learn a lot I mean

489
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,360
if you take the right attitude so it has been a very very beneficial process as

490
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:55,559
far as I can see so I'm in favor of difficult exams I think that it focuses

491
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,380
on his attention and and and enables you to really really do learn some

492
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,400
words and things well then I worked up if I passed this qualifier exam then you

493
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,440
could start a PhD program you couldn't formally start you pass that qualifier

494
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,239
so you have to find some professor who would take you on and then have some

495
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,279
research project that you wanted to do and I chose to stay with the guy who

496
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:24,279
worked as a research assistant because I was interested in the physics and

497
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,920
then the programs that he had and he also is a really nice generous man and he

498
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,800
had a you know five or six graduate students have a couple post-docs and it

499
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,040
was a it was a good learning environment so I elected to stay there and worked on

500
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,320
some problems in in photorodization we had machines that would generate vacuum

501
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,640
ultraviolet radiation and and use that radiation with monocromers dispersate and

502
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,120
use that use that radiation to study atomic and molecular systems you know

503
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,159
ionize them and use the mass spectrometer or spectrometer depending on to

504
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:01,359
analyze those reaction products from the ionization process and it's the

505
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,559
study things like cross sections and so forth for for

506
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:14,519
a reaction photon atom and molecule reactions and my work that did was to look

507
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,759
at ionization processes in rare earth elements the lanthanides so things like

508
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,280
eropium and eterbium erbium and things of that nature we generated ovens made

509
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,720
they're all metals at room temperature so you have to make a oven and in

510
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,560
generate a atomic beam all this is in vacuum of course the generator beam of

511
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,280
those and intersect that beam with the with the light beam and and to ionization

512
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,960
process you start knocking off electrons and you can monitor then the ion

513
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,320
products as a function of wavelength of the light and determine its

514
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,760
ionization potential so we measured some of the ionization processes of these

515
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,679
rare earth elements which hadn't been done because it was prior to this

516
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:03,320
difficult subsequent people did a lot of spectroscopy others and did much

517
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,960
got much more accurate results but it's those kind of experiments and it's

518
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,800
sort of a lot of fun you had to build learn how to build ovens a little high

519
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,480
temperature ovens and intersect that with all in the vacuum system and

520
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,519
intersect that with the light beam and get the mass of a comma which is a

521
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,760
relatively large instrument to measure the ion products and we also did some

522
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,080
work with organic molecules which are a lot easier you just let them they

523
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,920
vaporize and you can get a molecular beam fairly straightforward from

524
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,600
what's the organic molecule and study their processes and look at their

525
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,159
dissociation processes as well so we did studies of various kinds of molecules

526
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:49,960
that we would look at their ionization as well as dissociation processes how

527
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,799
independent were you in in developing these topics was it something where you

528
00:43:54,799 --> 00:44:00,440
you went to your mentor with this idea or was it kind of the way around now

529
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,279
what you had to end with with professor England you had to develop your own

530
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,040
copy and then convince him that this was something to do and even support

531
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,600
and that's what I did I was interested in the these rare earth because there

532
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,840
was some there was some interest in the scientific community about some of

533
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,280
their ionization properties and also some of the internal energy properties of

534
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,840
some of the organic molecules we studied people were interested in their internal

535
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,760
processes and then measuring their their energies if you will and because the

536
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,160
internal energies of these molecules determine how they combine with others

537
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,920
and so on and so there was interest in and getting things called heats of

538
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,280
formation of molecule ions and so forth that we did some studies on systems

539
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,600
who were of interest for other kinds of chemistry because that told you energy

540
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,080
balances in these ion molecule reactions so we were engaged in that kind of

541
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,639
research using these four ionization tools and those days that the four

542
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,759
ionization studies was hard because you had to have laboratory light sources so

543
00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:13,000
these would be discharges pulse discharges with a high electrical pulse in a

544
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,079
in a capillary tube filled with a rare gas usually or hydrogen in some cases

545
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,679
and like helium and then you generate the helium would get excited and

546
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:28,480
generate molecular helium which would then dissociate because helium was an

547
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,039
inner gas it doesn't form a molecule except in excited states and that

548
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,159
dissociation process is a mature radiation and the far old to violet so we'd use

549
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:42,719
that radiation and dispersal with the monocrominern and study these atoms and

550
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:48,280
then the ion molecules as well but subsequent you know by the time I left

551
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,800
graduate school and in the late 60s and it's certainly now and 70s on the

552
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,760
development of synchrotron radiation and also laser sources of the totally

553
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,840
surplated that to do what we did in those days now you go to synchrotron

554
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,120
most likely it would be fairly straightforward but it was it was hard that in

555
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,200
those days because of the the technology available you're limited to laboratory

556
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,680
light sources now there's the synchrotron radiation sources throughout the

557
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,120
world in fact that one worked at the National Institute of Standards and

558
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,000
Technology I was the reason they had a small synchrotron radiation source at

559
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,679
the institute and we use that for atomic and like for physics studies the same

560
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,960
kinds of basic technologies as I use in graduate school instead of having

561
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,760
these discharge light sources like a neon bulb if you will you have these big

562
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,679
big machines that generated radiation from synchrotron radiation but

563
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,679
as far as graduate school goes you had to you had the divisional projects and

564
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,559
then you had to publish and then Chicago had a requirement at that time that

565
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,000
your thesis had to be published in the peer reviewed literature so I had to

566
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,559
prepare an article for the journal chemical physics and then once that was

567
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,799
accepted that was and that was then you escaped the the rigors of half to

568
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:10,719
write a formal thesis that the paper that you wrote got accepted in a peer

569
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,279
reviewed journal was was basic your thesis you just bound that and and that

570
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:19,759
was it and you were not have to write one of these tedious 300 paid

571
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,960
thesis or something like some some places required I thought it was a good idea

572
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,320
because if you stop thinking about that's what you want your researchers to do

573
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,920
is be able to publish in the peer reviewed literature so that that's I thought

574
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,520
that was always a clever and sensible criteria and so something you had to achieve

575
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,320
but at least as graduate student you're guaranteed at least having one

576
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,440
publication if you're going to get your degree. Were there any folks within the

577
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,639
department that emerged as being important to you rememberable besides Ingram?

578
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:56,200
Oh yeah I had some classes from a famous scientist Greg Revenso and he was

579
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,039
he was a very very good teacher of a no-world gentleman like a swisher German

580
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:08,000
and he was one of the founders of the quantum vector dynamics back in the

581
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:16,960
40s and he was a he was a professor at Chicago at that time and also met I

582
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,400
learned a lot from the technical staff in the physics department of those

583
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,000
days they had a wonderful electronic engineer that's I worked with

584
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,159
developing building equipment and electronics equipment they had some

585
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,039
wonderful people in a machine shop because we had to make our own equipment we

586
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,239
didn't you didn't go to a catalog and buy a a mass spectrometer or a monocromber

587
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:45,480
you made it yourself and so I learned machining techniques and also got to be

588
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,400
a fairly good heliarch welder because we'd weld that the chambers together

589
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,400
the vacuum chambers together and that sort of thing and the guys in the shop would

590
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,800
teach you to do all that stuff and so I thought it was fascinating I got to do

591
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,759
all kinds of things that you know got paid for as a student that I really enjoyed

592
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,120
doing it was it was it was a wonderful experience how the years of Chicago were

593
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,280
just really in my mind really really very good and additionally getting a

594
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,920
family started and so on it was a wonderful learning experience did you do any

595
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,560
teaching uh case me and I would teach a course but not for undergrad I teach

596
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,760
some courses and people preparing for the basic exam or the qualifying exam

597
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,240
and assist assistant in some of the graduate courses but I never I was never

598
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,060
reached a teaching assistantship and in the sense of teaching the undergraduate courses

599
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:44,040
and so forth I was I avoided that and I was able to have a research assistantship

600
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,520
or they were in the lab and never never got so much involved on the teaching

601
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:57,720
side tell me about meeting Ruth 1966 that that was an interesting story we I was

602
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:06,360
driving out to go to my sister's wedding and she I had I was going to bring an

603
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,360
Indian friend of mine guy from India a menon was his name and he was going to

604
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,840
ride with me we were going to share expenses well he was a far tougher business man

605
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,520
than I was and he determined since I had that it was on the Dodge station

606
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,760
way of the time there was room for others he went around I'm being

607
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,400
honest to me and solicited other riders to go parts of the trip one guy came

608
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,040
all the way to Eugene I dropped him off on Eugene and but the Ruth rode with us

609
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:42,200
with a friend to Cheyenne Wyoming and we let him off there and I had a men

610
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,400
and had some financial reasons I don't know what it was and and so I got to be

611
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,260
a courier of people across the country to go on this trip but the minute

612
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,960
figure I had a minute figure he saved himself a lot of money I didn't expect

613
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,599
so that's how I met Ruth and I got back to Chicago right so I've seen her

614
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,480
turned out she lived in a place where I lived in an international house in

615
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,099
Chicago so we got together in Michigan Mary and she was a student I mean she's

616
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:18,659
an undergraduate at the time and you said you started a family yeah and a daughter

617
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:26,940
was born there her son was born there too in Chicago hospitals so what was

618
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,719
that like being a family man and a student at the same time it worked out pretty

619
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:36,279
well fortunately my wife is real capable and she she worked at some two at a

620
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:40,659
correspondence school they're called the American school it was in fact it was

621
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:44,500
a block away from our apartment where we left and so she could go get papers

622
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,639
and grade papers and work on these correspondence courses and that turned out a

623
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:55,379
source of income and and do that at home she didn't have to leave it in so the

624
00:51:55,379 --> 00:52:00,379
child was was was washed at home and we lived in student housing that was right on

625
00:52:00,379 --> 00:52:06,779
campus and fairly close so that worked out well well you were in Chicago during

626
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:13,540
turbulent times the 68th Democratic Convention as well known as being sort of

627
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,700
an iconic moment for that time period in that location you have any

628
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:23,340
memories of it was awful everybody's bad behavior contributed to a really

629
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,460
awful event I mean nothing no one can be proud of those days in my mind I mean

630
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:34,820
the protesters are out of line but then in the Chicago case the police's

631
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,780
response were totally out of line and I think it was characterized as a police

632
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,200
riot and I think that's about right now I'm a pretty conservative fellow but I

633
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:50,380
mean the Chicago cops were just we're just not the best I hope they've changed

634
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,700
over the years but you know I got shaken down twice in my in my years in

635
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:00,019
Chicago because I had an out-of-state plate license plate by cops you want to

636
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:06,059
drive for letting me off it was it was not pleasant I mean it did but that's

637
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:15,940
the way it was not all cops obviously but it was a corruption and they were not

638
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,739
nice not nice to the protesters in those days in fact I was I never went

639
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:26,139
up town to the to the world the convention was but I was just walking back

640
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:30,819
from the lab one night and there's some cop cars patrolling down there by the

641
00:53:30,819 --> 00:53:35,219
university looking for students to to harass and I had to they you know

642
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:39,179
well they were there's a cop a follow-up but I can tell it was a cop by their

643
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:41,859
plane clothesmen and they were thinking about harassing me they're

644
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:45,940
dragging by me as I was walking and really checking me out I could tell

645
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:52,539
that they were they were not thinking good thoughts they they were down in the

646
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:55,900
Southside and I suspect they wanted to get it on the action the comments were

647
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:02,700
having downtown and no I didn't like that that the Chicago cops at that time

648
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:09,240
I had to not a lot of respect for them because of my personal experiences

649
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,500
which may work in in family probably not a lot of free time but I'm wondering if

650
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,579
there's anything about Chicago that made a big impact on you in sort of a

651
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:22,820
social or cultural way there's a lot of cultural activities and as a student you

652
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,860
don't have a lot of money but there are a lot of inexpensive things to do

653
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,900
well the University of Chicago is not far from Lake Michigan and so you can you

654
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,260
can just walk down to the lake and have some beaches and so forth there was a

655
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,340
the Chicago Museum of the Side Industry was very close to the campus and that was

656
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:45,100
a wonderful museum and we'd go there frequently and they had forest

657
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:51,140
preserves in the outskirts of Chicago that were you know big parks and and so

658
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:55,739
Ruth and I and would spend time there on the picnic in the summer so you

659
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:00,219
wouldn't go out there in the Chicago winter but it's a couple of a couple of

660
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:05,619
guys I worked with in the machinists and the case of go fishing and do

661
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:11,420
something of that nature too so it's an interesting environment Chicago it's

662
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:16,619
very different from here and it was a real cultural shock the big thing

663
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:21,599
the Y-57 Dodge and I drove out had a you know it was an organ car right and so

664
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,500
the tires were bald and the battery was ancient and as soon as I get cold in

665
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,900
November car wouldn't start and the first time I got a little snow in the

666
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:35,539
street you couldn't go anywhere because the tires I had no tread and of course

667
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:40,500
I had a light windbreak kind of jacket and it got cold and so that

668
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,619
November December was a hectic time I had to get the car up so I would run in

669
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:49,900
in the in the winter time and go on the roads as well as get some clothes that

670
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,480
were appropriate for you know that 10 degree environment when the wind's

671
00:55:53,480 --> 00:56:00,980
howling so that was a real real real shocker in my first quarter I was living

672
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:06,539
in Chicago I was living in an apartment about 20 or 30 blocks from from what

673
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:11,019
the university was so I had to drive back and forth to school and I soon

674
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:17,619
rectified that I got a room at the international house for the second three

675
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:23,280
quarters that first year and I was able to walk back and forth to campus

676
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,059
because driving in the in the winters with an older car is not the best way

677
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:32,380
to get around it was terribly inconvenient and also parking problems and

678
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:39,179
cities it was a bad move and of course I hadn't realized that my first

679
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,060
applied to Chicago had been smart to range housing in advance I think it was

680
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,740
like pervallas you could just find an apartment you know that's a big city

681
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:53,220
fight it wasn't the case the apartment the living arrangements were a little

682
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,000
scarce and it was so it took me a few days actually when I arrived there I'd

683
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,200
stay in a hotel or someplace for a few days and I'd like to find an apartment

684
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,600
it was a quite far actually far from the university interesting learning

685
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:14,079
experience well yeah sort of the continuing topic of cultural shifts he'd

686
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:21,739
finished up in 1971 Chicago and went to Alabama tell me about that well I thought

687
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:27,480
I wanted to be a teaching profession and a friend of mine a former graduate

688
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,960
student who graduated went to the University of Alabama and got a pretty good

689
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:39,639
grant to get his research set up and and so they recruited me as well to come

690
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:43,960
down and get a research project started I interviewed with them and also with

691
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:50,119
a couple companies and decided I was going to be interviewed with a

692
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:54,280
sanded oil as it's called s or something and those days out in New Jersey

693
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,720
and they offered me a job as well but it had been an area in New Jersey I didn't

694
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:05,340
think much of it besides I wanted to get teaching a goal so I took a job as

695
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:09,280
an assistant professor at the University of Alabama so we lived in Tuscanos, Alabama

696
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:18,560
for 1970 to 78 years I guess it was and then I went on sabbatical leave at the

697
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,960
Bureau standards that was called in Maryland and then they offered me a job

698
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,360
and I decided that whether it be at the National Bureau standards rather than

699
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,840
back teaching and the research opportunities were far better it was a it was a

700
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,880
struggle at you know Alabama is a good school it's like in the other state

701
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:43,680
school but it's in those days it was hard to raise money and we thought it

702
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,079
difficult to raise money you know from the foundations and so forth and and

703
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,680
Alabama to get our research started we raised some we were fairly successful

704
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,640
let's turn to my Andrew Jason and I there were insurance and facilities there

705
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:00,859
but it was very very difficult he spent a lot of time just trying to raise

706
00:59:00,859 --> 00:59:06,819
money and then so on and also the teaching mode was fairly heavy compared to

707
00:59:06,819 --> 00:59:11,779
most universities it was two courses you had to have six contact hours a quarter

708
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:17,179
and didn't leave a lot of time for very research you just had to be in there

709
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:22,279
all hours of the day and night so it was not the best research environment of

710
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,080
course the University of Chicago was a graduate student that professors taught one

711
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,519
course two out of the three quarters one quarter they taught nothing I mean

712
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:34,519
they didn't have any teaching obligations so I mean there's a big difference

713
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:37,440
between the research universities in Europe and your average state

714
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,240
University I might just still that way most state universities that professors

715
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,080
will have at least two courses and that's very time consuming and so the at

716
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,200
the Bureau standards was on sabbatical leave versus no teaching and they were

717
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,920
fairly well funded compared to what it was at the Alabama and it was funded

718
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,560
directly by the government for government programs and so eventually I

719
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,800
got in a position we got to raise a lot of money you know because NBS events

720
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,880
the government organization we did do work for other government agencies and so

721
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,720
we did had programs at NASA and no department of defense supported so I raised

722
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,960
a lot we raised a lot of money from those agencies but for you know we'll be

723
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,920
applying programs rather than you know trying some fundamental research program

724
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,599
like at National Science Foundation so it was a very different environment I

725
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,519
actually sort of liked a lot better yeah so was the the project the research

726
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:34,280
topic in Alabama was that made mostly an extension of what you had been doing in

727
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,559
Chicago yeah so I built a smaller version of what we had in Chicago and we were

728
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,199
going to do do small work on on rare earth some got started on that and then

729
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,840
they'll small organic molecules and I did just gotten that project started

730
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,640
when I went on sabbatical leave and the reason I went on sabbatical leave was a

731
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,079
somebody gave it a donation or some money came up somehow they're going to

732
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,120
totally renovate the physics building everybody's going to have to move out all

733
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,440
the labs are going to be closed down so I said well what other than to sit here

734
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,960
for a year I had an offer had had an offer to go to to Maryland and the

735
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,680
National Bureau standards to work with a team there in the same kind of work

736
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,400
a photo organization studies and so I said well I'll just take a sabbatical

737
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,639
leave it's I want to work for them and you know just as a sabbatical leave

738
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:28,720
at the go standards and then that first year I still be paid by by Alabama and

739
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,480
and the National Bureau standards sent them some money to you know to pay for my

740
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,920
time it's called the Intergovernmental Personnel Act appointee and so I spent

741
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,440
the first year there then I was going to go back we're going to go back to

742
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,280
Alabama because we liked it that we had a nice house we'd build a nice house and

743
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,200
so forth but they they decided they didn't get done with the renovation things

744
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:55,840
bug on so they're going to be out a second year so I they had asked me if I

745
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,680
could stay a second year at the Bureau standards I said okay so it worked out

746
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,480
good then sometimes during the second year early in the second year they offered

747
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,600
me up a staff position at the Bureau standards which was actually doubled my

748
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,560
salary and then and it was a we're involved in a research program I really liked

749
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:18,159
and really had tied national international profile and worked with about a

750
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,440
really some really top people and it was all research and there was no there's

751
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,599
no teaching and no committees and none of this not a lot of fundraising in those

752
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,759
days so it was a real opportunity I thought and so I elected to stay at the

753
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:35,519
Bureau standards and so we just never went back to Alabama but that was not the

754
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:41,279
intention when we first went to the Gatedsburg Maryland for the Bureau standards

755
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,720
located what was your impression of the South when you were there I like

756
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,080
that it was the weather's awful I mean that's I never got used to that they

757
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,680
you know it starts in in May the hot humanity and you know it'll be in the

758
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,680
90s and you would you know by human I mean 90% humanity not people here get

759
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:05,519
off site if it's 40% humanity but I mean it would be very very human and it's

760
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,200
hard to get used to I never really did of course everything in your house your

761
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,800
carvings air condition you turn that air conditioning on and layman like I say

762
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,200
you're something by June and it would just be on until October I mean it was to

763
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,360
me it was very different now the natives people growing up in that they they

764
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,480
don't seem to bother but they you know you have become accustomed to a bite I

765
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,360
never really climatized to that hot email just that's the only thing I did

766
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:37,240
like about the people were nice Tuscaloosa is a loving little town it's no

767
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,480
say it was a smaller town bigger than Corvallis but it was a total college town

768
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,400
basic but and of course now it's a lot bigger they put a car factory Mercedes

769
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,640
one of those companies put a assembly plant there in Alabama that's not far

770
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:57,080
away so it's a lot of industrialization so it's a changed environment just

771
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:03,280
like a lot of college how about the culture of the area it was it was very

772
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,920
different I mean you know you normally think of it south as being real racist

773
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,680
well they they had this the old vestiges of segregation but it was to me it was

774
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,400
less harsh in those terms you know what I used to see in Chicago it was really

775
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,840
ugly in my mind in fact the first department I rented the guy says I'll give you

776
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:29,800
real good deal because I want a white guy live in here boy oh I didn't I had no

777
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,600
idea what the customer I'll take the deal because I need a place to say

778
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,280
this is good you know I hadn't arranged the housing but they were they were

779
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,840
they were there was definite racism and you could observe it you'd see some of

780
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,440
that in Alabama but not to the extent the race it seemed more harmonious to me

781
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:55,480
than the racial relations in Chicago the events of the blacks and the whites and

782
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,559
and then South now that other people probably have a different perspective I

783
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:03,599
know but I mean I didn't I didn't see the harshness that I would and they'll

784
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,679
work the things expressed that I saw in Chicago but just one man's take I

785
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,599
think other people I think I'll probably very different take on well one thing I'm

786
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,119
sure that was an inescapable while you were there was was called football oh yeah

787
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,679
they have one three national championships during your time bearbrain is the

788
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:29,640
coach yeah it was they take football real seriously in the South I mean the

789
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,560
average were going I mean they just live and die and then you know place like

790
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,640
Texas too I mean just and Mississippi Louisiana all of that says it is the sport

791
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,600
and they then they really take it take it seriously and and Alabama has this

792
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,680
constant feud with Auburn which is sort of Auburn sort of the quote of

793
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:53,240
Oregon State it's a it's a land crack school I think and Auburn because it's

794
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:59,560
in in the city of Auburn but there's a fierce rivalry and it's been going off

795
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,760
for years and years and they and they and it comes apart of the culture you can

796
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,160
people that don't go to the schools you know they're an Auburn and Alabama fan

797
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,640
and you know they can be a mill worker whatever you know I know they'll have

798
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:17,400
these for unknown reasons I see some of that in Oregon but nice it's not like

799
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,759
it's just pronouns but they do they do take football seriously and bear

800
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:30,239
Bryant was a really re-burred revered person I mean he had a lot of

801
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:36,960
clop I think for sure well you mentioned sabbatical and you started up

802
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:44,400
full-time at the National Bureau of Standards in 1980 so I guess you can

803
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,720
tell me a little bit about moving to the DC area and settling in and then your

804
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:52,400
first position a physicist in the radiations physics division yeah I was I

805
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,519
liked I liked it the climate Maryland is a little better you get you get cold

806
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,480
winners in Maryland so you get more diversity it's an Alabama it's hot most

807
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,159
of the time even all around but Maryland it's it she wouldn't hot in the

808
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,600
summertime which it cools down the fall on the winter you'll get snow and

809
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:15,000
so on so we first year we lived in an apartment and neither my wife and our

810
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,520
kids were like that so we bought a house after I was offered a job and bought a

811
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,920
house and lived in the same place I think from 1980 on and so I I kind of

812
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,760
like it it's a Washington DC area is a culturally diverse and very

813
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,020
very interesting region it's Civil War battlefields you know Gettysburg

814
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:40,119
Gettitum will run all those are hour so drive away from where we lived in

815
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,579
Gettysburg and those are all very interesting and well done by the National Park

816
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:51,219
Service in terms of historical presentations I really enjoyed that we enjoyed

817
01:07:51,219 --> 01:07:55,139
the museums downtown the specific museums are just simply the best there is

818
01:07:55,139 --> 01:08:00,699
and and that's that's all free and you know from where we were 30 minutes away

819
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,500
and take the train down now they put a subway system in and we live close to

820
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,900
the terminals of this one subway lines we could easily beat the end down if you

821
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:15,980
wanted so the cultural cultural things are immense and we would get season

822
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,860
tickets to the to some orchestra arrangements at the Kennedy Center and that

823
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:25,780
was that was always great crowded but great I mean it's as traffic is awful

824
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:31,059
downtown Washington but it was a it was a nice place to live I enjoyed the

825
01:08:31,059 --> 01:08:35,819
experience a great deal and you know there was a the

826
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:40,939
negocytes is the weather and it's also very very crowded the roads the Washington

827
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:48,099
Bellway it's it's truly awful and the road we were not too far from the

828
01:08:48,099 --> 01:08:53,699
interstate 270 which runs out of north of sort of northwest out of Washington

829
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:58,139
and that it's a missing busy road because all the commuter traffic back

830
01:08:58,139 --> 01:09:04,220
forth to DC and from the Maryland suburbs at the work downtown and it's 14

831
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,579
lanes in places you know seven lanes each way with feet or just it's just

832
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:13,019
awful and you get on out of each the bumper to bumper all those lanes and

833
01:09:13,019 --> 01:09:19,380
rush hour if he off rush hour is busy we would sometimes we bought a boat that

834
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:23,260
we kept over on the chest beacon even on a Saturday morning getting over to the

835
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:28,820
Chesapeake which is anapolis near anapolis was it should have been easy you know

836
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,000
hour hour and a half drive sometimes it lasts a lot longer because it's just

837
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,940
traffic on Saturday morning so it's a very very crowded that's one of the reasons

838
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:44,340
when we're required we we're not gonna live in in the DC suburbs just ended up

839
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:49,260
out here instead in Oregon but I think I was in decision we both are really glad

840
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:52,980
we made mainly the living conditions I mean the coastal activities that you

841
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:59,420
know and the things in the DC suburbs are really superb but the crowdedness

842
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,660
and the weather are really contrary to my particular life so some people

843
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:11,100
like it of course you know not what I like so we enjoy the weather and the

844
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,820
environment here much better we'll tell you about the prevention of your work

845
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:21,700
I was first hired at I was post-talking either not really post-talking

846
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:24,619
though I was for working as a guest scientist there the first year of our

847
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:30,420
civil professor at Alabama I worked in a laboratory with a guy named Henry

848
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,539
Rosenstock and Roger Stockbauer were very well known in in chemical

849
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:40,559
physics for doing in term structures of molecules they're the energetics of

850
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:46,699
molecules so we worked with some techniques using called threshold photoelectron

851
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:52,659
spectroscopy studying a molecular process as small molecules then at that

852
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:56,539
first year also they were getting started on the synchrotron facade and this

853
01:10:56,539 --> 01:11:01,300
the NEMBS has a small electron synchrotron which generates light

854
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:05,539
ultraviolet light they were getting a project started using synchrotron

855
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:10,659
radiation for photoelectrospectroscopy so I joined along with Roger Stockbauer

856
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:15,420
and a team from Argon Joe Deemer and his team at Argon National Laboratory

857
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:22,840
built an electron spectrometer system that was able to angler resolve the

858
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,619
electrons coming off from an ionization process and atoms with many small

859
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:32,180
molecules so we built that system at first year I was there and then and then

860
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:36,940
that was another reason for me to stay a second year and then eventually take a

861
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:40,659
job because that apparatus was just coming into fruition in terms of this

862
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:46,699
productivity so we were able to do some really really really interesting things

863
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:51,659
and new kinds of studies using synchrotron radiation and this electron spectrometer

864
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:56,819
doing angle resolved photoelectronization studies it was some of the first of

865
01:11:56,819 --> 01:12:04,340
that type in the world and it was very well received you know in this

866
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:08,659
community so we did that and then build a successively built new instruments in

867
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:13,539
terms of for photoelectron spectroscopy and angle resolved and

868
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:18,500
participated and else participated in a few other kinds of experience and so

869
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,659
the laboratory experiments that I first got started on when we went there we

870
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:25,939
quit all that all together and track those labs were closed down to make up

871
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:30,819
all the photoelectronization had to work out that was done with the synchrotron

872
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:36,139
and that's where I was hired when they offered me a staff position was to work

873
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:40,539
on the the team of science is working on that they call it surf synchrotron

874
01:12:40,539 --> 01:12:46,340
ultraviolet radiation facility at MPS and in 1980 you're 81 they changed the

875
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:51,619
name from MPS to NIST so it's the same organization with these

876
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:56,980
Congress in there infinite wisdom decided to change the name reflected a

877
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,539
little different mission I guess was the idea like changing Oregon State

878
01:13:00,539 --> 01:13:04,860
College, Oregon State University that sort of thing and that nothing fundamentally

879
01:13:04,859 --> 01:13:10,979
changed it's just after we do all the letterhead and door signs but it's

880
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:18,019
I worked in that operation for about five years as a as a research physicist in

881
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:25,179
the radiation physics division and with the pilot about a physics group under

882
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:29,219
working with the under the guy named Robert Matten who was in charge of the

883
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:34,099
synchrotron very well known optical person monoclonal design and so forth

884
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:40,900
so it was a wonderful experience working with the scientists there and the

885
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:45,660
other nice nice thing about NIST I'll call it that that's his name now is

886
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:51,500
that it's in Washington DC area so you get a continual tour touring of a

887
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:55,579
really well known scientist from throughout the world this is one thing I missed

888
01:13:55,579 --> 01:14:00,300
in in Alabama you know you have to really work out to get to Tuscaloosa but

889
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,060
everybody comes through Washington DC and they would visit NIST in the

890
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,860
those days and we also collaborated with a team of scientists on these

891
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:13,500
photon works from from from England and John West from Darsbury laboratory in

892
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,980
England key coddling from a Reading University in England another people in our

893
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:23,380
programs and in fact I would then go to to England and work on on the

894
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,780
on the sycrotron facility at Darsbury in the United Kingdom and the later

895
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:32,260
stages we transported over the instrumentation that we'd build it NIST

896
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:37,900
new flow electron spectroscopy we we we transported it to England this was a

897
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:43,500
big piece of equipment many tons and and transported to the Darsbury laboratory

898
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:49,900
and near up near Manchester Darsbury is a small town and in the side of the

899
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,460
performer and do some work over there as well with my English colleague so it was

900
01:14:53,460 --> 01:15:00,180
a real nice collaboration between the Bureau standard and NIST and the and the

901
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:06,000
English Darsbury laboratory so of course they made good French movies so so

902
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,659
have to this day with the English colleague got spent some time in in other

903
01:15:10,659 --> 01:15:16,140
sycrotron facilities in France and other places as well to visit it was a very

904
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:21,060
very rewarding time so I typically and a lot of travel and and interesting people

905
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:26,380
that was one of the nice things I really enjoyed about NIST was the depth of

906
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:32,100
the people we've worked with and so the best people from from all over the

907
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:39,380
world we had guests from France China you know Japan all over and come to work

908
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:45,579
in our laboratories and that was a extremely rewarding scientific time and so

909
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:51,779
I worked on those sycrotron race experiments until the mid 1980s 85 or 86

910
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:56,739
something like that then I was offered a job in another division as a group leader

911
01:15:56,739 --> 01:16:05,219
there was a division that was having some personnel problems and and they had

912
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:10,259
a lot of difficulties and I was asked to take over a group that was they needed

913
01:16:10,259 --> 01:16:14,099
some attention and they called the specter radiometry group I guess it was

914
01:16:14,099 --> 01:16:17,619
the name of it so I became a group leader which is the law level management

915
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:24,939
physician at NIST and I think about 1986 something like that I don't know and

916
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:29,460
worked on that division it was called the radiometric physics division and it

917
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:36,579
was its job was to do all the optical measurements or most of the optical

918
01:16:36,579 --> 01:16:39,779
measurements for this country of standards they did everything from standard light

919
01:16:39,779 --> 01:16:44,380
bolts you know when you buy light bulb the store will have a aluminum rating on it

920
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:48,140
but we maintain those standards in the standard of the candle as well as optical

921
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:52,659
temperature measurements so we developed that division responsibilities to

922
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:56,779
maintain all those standards as well as to develop the technology to improve

923
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:03,900
the the standards so the worked a lot with industry to collaborate with industrial

924
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:08,460
partners to develop better measurement techniques to help product quality

925
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:11,940
and reliability on the assembly a lot of work with zero off companies like

926
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:16,140
Kodak 3M that they do have a lot of optical

927
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:20,580
optical measurement problems for example 3M makes a lot of white paper and

928
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,300
things like that they should need reflective standards and how you measure all

929
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,540
that and so on I spent time with helping Kodak develop color of colored

930
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:33,140
measuring processes and optical processes for property making and measuring

931
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,140
film they had a lot a lot of interest and that in those days those are the film

932
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:43,180
days the whole technology has changed but then on LEDs and other kinds of sources

933
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,180
light sources that became available we had to develop the technology to

934
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:49,660
properly characterize those and imagine because they there are a little

935
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,420
different little different needs in your incandescent bulbs and

936
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:57,740
fluorescent bulbs and so our division worked with industry to develop the

937
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,700
right strategy to making reliable and consistent measurements and it came

938
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:06,300
industry standards in for how you measure an LEDs property and so on so

939
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,020
that's the job that division I've actually became the division chief of that

940
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,300
division I remember when that was and then

941
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:20,140
ladies early 90s and that's why I retired in 2007 was this chief of the

942
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:25,220
changes name and optical technology division since I've blessed the

943
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,579
subsequent changes name again there's been another reorganization but it's

944
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:32,900
basically the same division now called sensor science division or something of

945
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,780
that nature so I was able to then be in charge of all these measurement techniques

946
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:43,700
and develop develop develop work for other government agencies and that was

947
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:49,700
very rewarding I enjoyed that we had projects back in the mid-80s

948
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,180
effect was one of my first jobs as a group leader in spectoradiometry the

949
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:59,980
defense department was having problems characterizing very low level

950
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:08,180
infrared sensors that are used for satellite purposes and very

951
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,780
the national security program and they had to be sensors that were

952
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:18,220
calibrated at very very low temperatures because they were sensors that look

953
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,580
at the background of space looking at missile threat that sort of thing and so

954
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,300
they would operate very low temperatures that had to be calibrated and make

955
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,540
for measurement experiments to make sure they were seen what they told you they

956
01:19:28,539 --> 01:19:32,979
were seen and that we developed techniques to calibrate things that you know

957
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:36,859
five degrees Kelvin just a little above absolute zero very very low

958
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:40,380
temperatures and called a low background infrared calibration so if that was a

959
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:45,619
real challenge technically and that that's facility still and in place being

960
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:52,060
used to to characterize a very low level background as signals that sensor

961
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:58,180
systems primarily do the occasionally NASA and other government agencies have

962
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,900
needs for characterizing very low low background sources things are going to

963
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:08,060
operate the space primarily so that was a fun project and and develop new

964
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,700
technology and capabilities for the Department of Defense and they of course would

965
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:16,060
pay for the Department of Defense of Payness for doing this work and so we

966
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:21,500
raised on a lot of projects for NOAA and NASA for the support that's

967
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:27,380
where the optical did division supporting satellite technology you see these

968
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:31,579
pictures of the color pictures of the earth you see you see pictures of the

969
01:20:31,579 --> 01:20:36,739
oceans where they they're using cameras from on spacecraft to measure ocean

970
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:41,340
properties all those cameras and then and devices have to be calibrated their

971
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,199
spectrary armors system basically flying around the space looking at the

972
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:49,220
spectral content of light coming back from the earth from the surface

973
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:53,180
reflected and that tells you about the the properties of the vegetation in the

974
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:58,060
case the oceans the plankton and then in the in the carbon content of the ocean

975
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:02,520
so we work with a NASA developed calibration strategies to calibrate the

976
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,900
satellites and then involves building calibration systems for the satellites

977
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:11,400
before they are launched and then trying to build systems so they can

978
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,880
verify their operational and flight and that tells us for example the satellite

979
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,920
looking at standard sources in fact there's a we have one of the big projects

980
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,840
was to have a there's a buoy system out near and not Lenin and Hawaiian islands

981
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:32,000
that measures the light coming out of the ocean they call it the upwelling

982
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,440
radiance of the ocean so it's reflected light from the sun going back up and

983
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,480
that's what the spacecraft will see you see you'll see the light coming off the

984
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:44,239
ocean so that's measured out in Hawaii so the spacecraft will have a and it'll

985
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,800
fly over and give them a simultaneously measurement we can tell them what it is at

986
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,440
the Earth's surface of the water surface if you will and the satellite then can

987
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,159
check its calibration and that's been an ongoing project in fact I'm still

988
01:21:57,159 --> 01:22:00,920
consulting some on that particular project but we have other projects to

989
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,239
develop in other projects developing calibration procedures and measurement

990
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:09,360
procedures a whole range of sensor systems for the for the no one asks the

991
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:14,960
projects as well as the defense department another another agencies that have

992
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,840
a secure program so they have the rice-fiscated sensor systems we work with

993
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:25,159
them on that as well let's see I or whatever you know they have a center

994
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:29,600
programs and we were a government agency that would help work with them to

995
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:36,199
to develop their central measurement capabilities but as I listen to you

996
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:39,439
describe this said a couple things occurred I mean everyone it sounds like there's

997
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:44,359
a pretty big shift when you when you switch gears to the radiation

998
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,359
physics division or to that sorry the great spectral radio on the

999
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:51,079
spectral radio on the tree group from doing sort of this more fundamental

1000
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:54,439
research you're doing before to this the standard of the big shift from a

1001
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:59,639
fundamental research to applied research but the underlying theme was it was

1002
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:03,679
all light measuring and manipulation controlling light and sick

1003
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,679
coroneration using light as a source so you have to build monocromers and

1004
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:12,639
build detectors of radiological radiation and so on so and then in

1005
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,000
radiometry the concentration is not on the use of the light but of measuring

1006
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,600
the light and characterizing you see and characterizing the sensors so that

1007
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,920
someone else can you know quickly determine what they're measuring and in the

1008
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,680
case the satellites what they want to know is what the what the the radiation is

1009
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:35,200
a one way that compared to another and the one or that pretty accurately so

1010
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,600
that those ratios those wavelengths will tell you for example the plankton

1011
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,640
concentration and so it's it's all optics of some sort or the

1012
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:47,440
electromagnetic radiation but it's a different emphasis you have to write the

1013
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:52,079
radiometry division was very applied on the measurement and the measurement

1014
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:58,440
technology and development of sources as well as the characterization of

1015
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,120
these things whereas the previously the sick coroneration resources was the

1016
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,280
fundamental driver was trying to understand some basic features of the

1017
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:10,319
atomic collector of physics you know how molecules are nice and dissociate so

1018
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:15,759
on it's also the application of science to a very wide variety of projects

1019
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,319
some of which apparently involve some national security implications must

1020
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:23,920
develop a tremendous fun yeah it is and very diverse I mean and we had

1021
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,920
colleagues at our labs in Boulder there was a whole group of divisions it was

1022
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,079
just concentrated on developing techniques for measuring laser and laser power

1023
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:38,519
and that was you know we collaborate them too it was fascinating and so it was

1024
01:24:38,519 --> 01:24:43,119
a real learning experience and it was also a lot of fun and you know that's the

1025
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,720
highest level and you're the best people doing this anywhere I think our

1026
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,760
organization had you know in terms of national lives it was probably you know

1027
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,519
the one of the premier national labs and in the world in terms of the quality of

1028
01:24:55,519 --> 01:24:59,519
its research and calibration and development so it was a really you know

1029
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,640
really a lot of fun and it was a very rewarding and intellectually I mean

1030
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,880
and again it's the people I mean these are the best for these were the best

1031
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:13,400
people in these fields in anywhere so it's a very enjoyable time it's a job

1032
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:18,320
that I hope everybody can get I mean a job in a sense that you go to work and

1033
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,840
you really love it and you don't try to avoid working on it that's fun to be

1034
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,840
there so I really feel fortunate in that regard to have got myself into

1035
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:33,840
a career where work was really fun it was financial rewarding but it was it was

1036
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,760
enjoyable to do and not some people I'm doing you talked to there there was

1037
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,000
discrepanel about the working I would never say that I truly enjoyed my

1038
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,360
career in grad school at Oregon State I enjoyed being a student I enjoyed

1039
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:51,119
graduate school and I enjoyed beating the national junior state of technology as

1040
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:53,960
well

1041
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:59,760
couldn't ask for any more with it yeah well what was what was your what was your

1042
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:06,439
family up to while during the DC era DC years your wife and children yeah my wife

1043
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:12,479
worked that she worked at several occupations she ran daycare at home for a

1044
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,199
while but eventually she went back to the school to went to hop and John

1045
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:21,199
Hopkins and got her a master's degree in counseling and then working in the

1046
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:25,880
school systems there in Montgomery County for many years as a middle school

1047
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:32,119
counselor and so on so she was able to retire from that when we left as a school

1048
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:39,000
counselor my kids went both went to college in Maryland and they enjoyed that

1049
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,479
my fact my son is still out in in there he lives and he said the

1050
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:49,080
after college he wanted to be a cop he got on he's with the Fairfax County

1051
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:54,760
police it's just across the river from Washington DC and he enjoys that a great

1052
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,960
deal my daughter is a nurse and she lives out here in in Oregon City works for

1053
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:04,120
Kaiser and in an important area

1054
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,400
well I switch gears a little bit and ask you about books and book collecting

1055
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,280
that's how we first became acquainted with one another and I'm interested in

1056
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:15,359
remember that start how do you get into collecting collecting books I still

1057
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,479
have my books from high school and a lot of them and probably a good portion of

1058
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:26,519
my books from from Oregon State to some of them and so I always just like books

1059
01:27:26,519 --> 01:27:31,920
and I don't know I like to books and graduate school I always like to read and

1060
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:37,279
then mainly when we moved to Washington in Maryland actually I should say

1061
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:43,119
in DC suburb I got interested in older books rare books the friend mine was

1062
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:48,800
also interested so we sort of got involved in that together back in the in the in the 80s

1063
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:59,279
and got sort of collecting you know significant volumes back in the late 80s I think and

1064
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:05,519
got interested in the history of printing was fascinating and how how that affected

1065
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:13,040
our culture in my mind that's the ability to print disseminate the information really had a

1066
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,960
profound effect on our culturally vulnerable religion with you know education and

1067
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,080
change change change change how we live and they think and they allowed

1068
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:32,080
everybody if they could learn to read to have access to information and led to things like the

1069
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:40,079
reformation and the real cultural changes and then not to speak about how it affected

1070
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:45,199
education if you think about it before the printed book getting a book was very very difficult

1071
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:50,000
getting knowledge was very very definitely good lecture because someone had read something

1072
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:57,760
but to get a copy of a scholarly work prior to the learning of the printing press you had to be

1073
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:03,920
both enough to hire somebody to do it by hand to get to get to get that so the average person

1074
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,640
even though the professional person probably wouldn't have any volumes back prior to the printing

1075
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:13,520
process but the printing press was in my mind it was a great liberating thing for for changing

1076
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,880
culture and it did and I just sort of interested in that got interested in the technology of printing

1077
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,920
and and then of course some of the the volumes are just beautiful and a wonderful look at and

1078
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,560
how they were and how they preserved I always found that fascinating too you can buy a book that's

1079
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:35,520
500 years old and open it up and it probably looks as you know someone look as good as the day they

1080
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:43,920
were they were printed like one of the books that the library has is a 5003 Seneca it's in Latin

1081
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:51,600
but it's of Seneca's works and that paper is as fresh as the day it was made there's no Fox

1082
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,039
you know a lot of books the paper a lot of Fox you know it's just a change in the character of the

1083
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:03,680
paper but the they last forever it seems like so it's just a it's a fascinating technology but

1084
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:11,520
just keeping in mind the the the profound impact it had upon on our civilization and how we

1085
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:17,600
write what we are now now it's comparable change in the last couple decades of how this electronic

1086
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,560
environment electronically delivered information is going to affect culture remains to be seen

1087
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:28,079
and how that integrates into the educational process and and in our general cultural

1088
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:34,640
behavior so it will be an interesting thing I probably won't live long enough to see the outcome

1089
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:40,079
of the orbital it's an it's a profound change and how people can get information and how you

1090
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:48,079
deliver information and so things will slowly evolve as they certainly did in the late 15th

1091
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:53,920
century when the printing press became available and now education everything changed to

1092
01:30:55,680 --> 01:31:01,760
profoundly tell me a bit about your methods for collecting that scouting out and purchasing and

1093
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:08,319
I got a topical thing either if I could get early science things that's in my science as I always

1094
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:15,840
would get that if if I something I could afford and then it primarily was in history I was always

1095
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,599
at some interest in history and in the history of printing so I have some of the volumes I have

1096
01:31:21,599 --> 01:31:28,399
about purely because they were from a given printer and and and and and and town like Venice or

1097
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:35,359
whatever from the from maybe the 16th century that would be representative of that kind of printing

1098
01:31:35,839 --> 01:31:40,479
that that that era so some of the books with that and then their role in scholarly works to like

1099
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:46,799
the Seneca I mentioned earlier and then there's this another nice volume I give you the

1100
01:31:46,799 --> 01:31:53,359
Straybo Geography which is a early early production of a Straybo who was a Roman Geographer's

1101
01:31:54,799 --> 01:32:00,880
commentaries and maps of the ancient world that book is complete with all the diagram maps and

1102
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:07,760
diagrams and so forth and so it's fascinating to Venice and both Greek and Latin and it's fascinating

1103
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:14,880
just to look at that and see the the the the Romans concept of the way the world was I mean in the

1104
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,680
master actually fairly accurate with the curvature there's totally displayed and so on and so on so

1105
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:27,119
the it tells you it just shows you just quite graphically how how you know how almost the ancient

1106
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:34,000
really knew about the world and they weren't as as it's ignorant as it's sometimes portrayed

1107
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:39,039
so I I get to kick in and then the some of the early scientific stuff too there's a

1108
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:46,800
copy of it's in French and Ben Frank was working on electricity and that was published I don't

1109
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,640
think with the reposition in this country was published in France when he was we spent

1110
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:57,280
time in France and so it was a little inside into and to Ben Frank's time as a as a Franco

1111
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:03,520
file I mean serving the country in France so it's some early Newton that's just it's absolutely

1112
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,160
fascinating I think and there's some other interesting early scientific books as well

1113
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:13,840
I think they're interesting but the scholarly things are some good histories you know and

1114
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:25,119
it's a good collection of Johnson the writer poet and his biography Boswell you have a nice set

1115
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:32,480
of a really nice early early productions and publications and that's here so that's a

1116
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:37,279
important part of the cultural history of the English-speaking people well it's things like that

1117
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:43,600
would track my interest as well as the quite a few travel books so the early travel books people

1118
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:52,400
back in the 16th and 17th century no woman would finance someone to take a trip through the

1119
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:58,240
orient or through the northern Africa the Levant or something and and record it record the customs

1120
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:04,160
of the people and also take along either do it themselves or take along someone to do engravings

1121
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:10,560
and drawings and then make these nice nice printed copies of their travels so when I run across

1122
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,920
those if there were a good shape I would try and procure those as well because there was an

1123
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:24,000
interesting insight into the culture and history and in those time frames well those those kinds

1124
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,640
of things as well I found interesting and sometimes books are just beautiful I mean they're

1125
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,560
printed beautiful and the bindings and good shape and you just say well I gotta have that

1126
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,200
well I know that you've taken pride in the fact that you actually read these books too you'll

1127
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:44,559
purchase them and put them on the shelf yeah exactly in fact I can continue to do so even I gave

1128
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:50,800
working state the majority see this right over here is a deflected in the last couple of years

1129
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:57,199
eventually you'll end up in your library but I've got a for example even in the other room I say

1130
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:03,760
on the stand trial often said I got a really nice Bible the one of the first complete English

1131
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:09,600
Bible is printed in the United States in fact it's generally thought to be like 1796 the first

1132
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,640
complete Bible and I've some earlier just new Old Testament and and New Testament's published but

1133
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:20,960
this is a complete Bible called the Collins Bible I believe with the Old Testament New Testament

1134
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,159
all the books of the paragraph are all bound in one and it's a really good shape so that's

1135
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:33,519
something I came across just just recently in last year or so and there's a big thick book of

1136
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:40,720
theirs is Plutarch's lies and early Plutarch's lies in English so that's fun to sit down and read

1137
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:49,039
Plutarch was across the Roman bog for back back and so you want to know by Julius Caesar Alexander

1138
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:56,479
the great of these people that have early early early printing of Plutarch of course you

1139
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:02,720
can go down people a paperback now the same thing but here's a nice early publication of Plutarch

1140
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,079
we spent three decades just compiling this collection they made decisions at some point to

1141
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,159
donate it to your alma mater urban state will tell me about the thought process there

1142
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:17,760
well I knew neither one of my kids is really interested in rare books per se of course they'd

1143
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,400
be interested in the value that they're up I mean that goes without saying right I mean they

1144
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:28,400
have to be hindered mentally if they didn't want that you know but the if you have a collection

1145
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:33,680
like that and people with collections often have this this issue as you get older so how do I do

1146
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:38,960
you know what's going to be the ultimate disposal if we my wife and I both pass will pass away

1147
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:44,000
if these books were still sitting in the house the children wouldn't know how to you know they don't

1148
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,319
pick them off them in their house but what would they do with them well they would call of some

1149
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:55,279
estate agent right and then they would sell on somebody being here buying a five thousand dollar

1150
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:01,520
book for fifty cents right and that's not too smart the other option well well I could start

1151
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:10,079
selling it on myself that is truly a legal option you could do it and you might or might not

1152
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:15,359
realize very much money but the the beauty of the donation is you can have them appraised by

1153
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:20,720
a good appraiser and they stayed together there's a collection in the case of that's what we've

1154
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:25,439
worked up for at Oregon State so others will use them so it was very satisfying when you were

1155
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:31,439
and or somebody tells me how the students are using that was the intent so we decided that rather

1156
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:35,840
than trying to sell them or something I think well given to Oregon State the benefit to us is

1157
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:45,520
it's a tax deduction so we get to realize a tax deduction since it's a large sum over over

1158
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:52,079
over a period of time and and and and help us out financially so actually probably in the end

1159
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:57,119
that's probably more rewarding financially than trying to sell them in all that headache plus

1160
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:01,920
the main thing is they stay together there's a collection for others to use again as long as I

1161
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:07,520
like in the car and drive down on myself you see so I we thought it was we thought about it a while

1162
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:14,480
and and we finally decided that was the part of the best strategy and then Mr. Meek came up

1163
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:21,520
and looked them over and then he said that I'm arranged with your librarian Faye to accept

1164
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:27,279
the collection and and so it's worked out excellent and we're really satisfied because the staff

1165
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:33,039
of Oregon State is just super in the library and then it's been served the students there because

1166
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:37,279
I was a student there and I don't think there was anything like that there when I was there

1167
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:43,920
if there was I was not cognizant of it so if we can benefit the kids of this state or whoever

1168
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:51,519
that's that's very satisfying and the main thing is something we spend a long time

1169
01:38:51,920 --> 01:39:00,160
massing and then to have it just go to all with the and try and sell it it's it's not that's rewarding

1170
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:06,080
it is financially but that wouldn't mean that much to us I mean we're comfortable with retirement

1171
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,920
another few thousand dollars when we was at this point in our life is not going to be particularly

1172
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:18,480
beneficial so it's much more satisfying to do what we did and of course I applaud Oregon State

1173
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:24,400
immediately and part because that's where I was graduated from and I liked it the great deal

1174
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,520
I have very fond members of Oregon State but also one of my friends probably got me thinking about

1175
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:37,040
was it was Derek Callahan who was on the alumni or association the foundation for a while and

1176
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,720
he was he didn't raise the issue about Donnie but he told me about the kind of things he did

1177
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,760
you know really helping the university raise money and so forth and that sort of sparked my

1178
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:49,680
mind well maybe that's something we could do you know I helped the university out by

1179
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:55,520
so we contacted Derek put us in contact with something in the foundation and

1180
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:03,039
and I'll Ryan is Ryan Robinson at the time and and working with he and the and the library staff

1181
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,720
with me and so forth we made the arrangements so we we have found a very satisfying

1182
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,840
the last thing I want to ask you about is your continued connection to OSU you're never the

1183
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:20,800
library advisory council OSU is in the midst of a transition expansion right now what is your

1184
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,520
sense of where OSU is at right now a very different place from the one that you went to it's

1185
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,800
certainly yes and I think what you what the faith in the rest of you've done to the library is

1186
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,079
just phenomenal I mean the library was not at all like that when I was a student here and trying

1187
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:42,480
to transition and take advantage of the modern electronic tools and make it space for the for the

1188
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:48,400
students to use I'm always impressed when I go down to the places pack I was sure you back

1189
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:56,720
back in the 60s you find a few people pointed over the line but that wasn't a lot so you've

1190
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:03,040
turned it into a central learning experience with space for the kids you know I think it's

1191
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:08,400
terrible important so I think this you got the transitional library to a to a really a part

1192
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,160
of the learning environment for a large number of students it's sort of exciting it's fun to be a

1193
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:19,360
part of so my wife and I were very interested in helping out in any way we can and of course we've

1194
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:28,560
had a lot of experience with books and in education and in conveying information so we think we'd be

1195
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:35,039
using some value well thank you very much for this I appreciate quite a lot well thank you

1196
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:37,039
here's some good fun to help out
