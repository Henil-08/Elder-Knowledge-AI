1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
All right, so we aren't quite enough.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,759
If you would please go ahead and introduce yourself by the name of the State Television.

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:17,280
Okay, I'm Bill Robbins, formerly, William G. Robbins.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:28,400
Today is March 27, 2012, and we're in the third floor of the Oregon State University Library.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,640
And this is an interview having to do with my long-time esteemed colleague, William

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,920
Appleman Williams.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,679
So that is what we are in, principally, interested in time by today.

8
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,000
If you could give us a little context, though, just kind of a brief, something else, but

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,920
to be your own life in your career.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Okay, I'm Connecticut Yankee by birth, and have some residents with Bill Williams career.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,720
I spent four years in the Navy.

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,920
I did not, however, attend the Naval Academy.

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,640
I was a listed man right out of high school.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,000
I went to undergraduate school after the Navy experience.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,680
I was out actually five years out of high school before I went to school, got a degree in a

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,400
small teachers college in Connecticut, spent one semester at Syracuse University, and then

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:34,520
moved to Oregon in 1963, taught school for one year, and began taking graduate seminars

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,800
at the University of Oregon, and finished a master's degree in British history at the

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:48,120
University of Oregon in 1965, moved east to the University of Maine where I had ambitions

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,960
to do a PhD.

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,360
It didn't work out there for reasons that are not pertinent to this discussion.

22
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:02,319
When I returned to Oregon in the fall of 1966 in American history, and received the

23
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:11,319
PhD in 1969, and began teaching here and there on visiting appointments and wound up at Oregon

24
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:20,120
State in 1971, and I was here for three or four years on visiting appointments, and one

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,319
of them I know was when Bill Williams took a research leave, and with the proviso that

26
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:35,719
I be some of the money used to be higher to hire me as another interim appointment for

27
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:44,680
that year, and then I got on a tenure track, and so I was at Oregon State from 1971 full

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,280
time till 1999, and I went half-time and retired full time in 2002.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,480
So Williams came to us in 1968?

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
1968.

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
For good.

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,920
It sounds like there was an interaction with him before then.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Well, briefly, and it's a fun story, and I'm glad you asked that question.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,240
I was a graduate student.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,439
I first discovered Bill Williams when I was at the University of Maine.

36
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:25,120
And it had directly to do with the anti-war movement having to do with Vietnam, and sometime

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,680
in the fall of 1965, or spring of 1966, I started reading Williams.

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,879
I read Tragedy of American Diplomacy first, and then I read articles that he wrote on various

39
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:47,319
publications, Minority of One, and the Progressive, having to do with American Foreign Relations

40
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,599
and so forth.

41
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:56,240
And so when I came back to return to the University of Oregon to work on the PhD, I was fully

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,919
vested in my research project, but I was also fully vested in anti-war activities on campus

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,840
and in Eugene Community.

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:17,080
And by the fall of 1968 when Bill moved from Madison to Corvallis, I was writing my doctoral

45
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:26,680
dissertation at that point, and stunned to hear that he had moved to Oregon State.

46
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,720
I mean, speechless.

47
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,920
And it had to do with a perception, mostly erroneous, that we had his graduate students at University

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,560
of Oregon, that the Oregon State University was a bastion of reactionary politics and so

49
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
forth.

50
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,480
That I learned, of course, was a far stretch when I came here and joined the faculty.

51
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:59,680
But to make this story, to bring it current, in late January of 1969, the University of

52
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Oregon history faculty invited Bill to campus.

53
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,680
And it was his first appearance back on campus since he left.

54
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,480
He had been there before, but giving a formal address on campus.

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,759
And I think it was January 29, 1969 or January 28, 1969.

56
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,160
And it was the onset of a huge snowstorm, that you can go into newspapers, you can find

57
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,879
it, confirm it.

58
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:37,720
But it was on a Friday night, and he spoke to a packed hall in Urb Memorial Room 105.

59
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,280
And I was there as were all of my graduate student colleagues, who were a pretty eclectic

60
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,720
and very bright bunch.

61
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,280
Maybe the best group of graduate students at the U of O ever had in history, my guess.

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Anyway, I can't remember Bill's, just what the substance of his address was.

63
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:11,360
But the next day, Mitz mounting snowfall, he spoke to graduate students in Chapman Hall,

64
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,360
which was a place where graduate students would gather.

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,159
And I can't remember what ticker college or department Chapman Hall was associated with.

66
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:32,839
And it was kind of a Q and A. And, of course, I was enamored with Bill and I was all fired

67
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:41,840
up with a major question I wanted to know what drove him to become the person he did, something

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
like that.

69
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,800
And I'm sure I articulated my question like an idiot.

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,040
I will never forget his response.

71
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,600
This is a direct quote.

72
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,920
What the hell kind of a question is that?

73
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Totally humiliated.

74
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:10,920
And after I got to know Bill, I would tell him that story and he said, oh, I wouldn't have said something.

75
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
I said, you sure did.

76
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:20,920
So, well, in other words, Bill was a historian's historian.

77
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,920
If you read the essays that Paul's working on the unpublished essays,

78
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,920
they're reek with history, with a sense of history.

79
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,920
And my question had nothing to do with that, had to do with political activism,

80
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,920
presentess politics, and so forth.

81
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Just the opposite of the kind of person that Bill was.

82
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Did you ever going to answer your question?

83
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
No.

84
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I can't remember it.

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
It went on from there.

86
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I think I started looking furtively out the window at the mounting snow.

87
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I don't know how Bill ever got home.

88
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,920
He was living in Newport at the time.

89
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Because Eugene came to a standstill.

90
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I remember 43 inches of snowfall in little over 24 hours.

91
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,920
But it sounds like tragedy was an important part of UX and contours as well.

92
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Contours much greater than tragedy.

93
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:36,920
I used to say on my desk, I had Webster's Dictionary in contours of American history.

94
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,920
And it influenced in a large way, because I consulted it regularly

95
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,919
in teaching the United States history.

96
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:55,919
And I can't remember the details, but I can say that when I was teaching Pacific Northwest history

97
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,919
about the Lewis and Clark expedition, I consult the index and find Lewis and Clark

98
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,919
and Jefferson and so forth.

99
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,919
And I remember a line that I would quote to students

100
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:17,919
from contours of American history.

101
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,919
That Jefferson was the great American Democrat.

102
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,919
Jefferson was the great American Empire Builder.

103
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,919
Right in the same Vogue.

104
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:38,919
Contours and Paul Beall-Barris Saisout was a major, major book that historians have still have to contend with.

105
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:45,919
So your experience was not isolated by any question?

106
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,919
No, no. I don't think so.

107
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:57,919
But beyond that, when I came here and joined the faculty in 1971

108
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,919
in my constant association with Bill,

109
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:11,919
I began to think much more seriously and it really did direct my research in publication for many years

110
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:19,919
is his notion of political economy, the intersection between politics and economics.

111
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:29,919
And here I became interested in natural resource industries

112
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:37,919
and the intersection of politics and economics and something that has stayed with me ever since.

113
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,919
What sounds like you came to LSU about three years after wings,

114
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,919
but that you know much about the courtship or the hiring of boys.

115
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,919
I do and mainly from Bill.

116
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,919
And I should have brought my doctoral dissertation with me because I have to say

117
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:01,919
that in the fall of 1969, I taught a US history course here on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

118
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,919
And it was Tuesdays and Thursdays when Bill was here because that was his schedule.

119
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:16,919
And he read my dissertation and he wrote in his beautiful script just some comments.

120
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,919
And I'll try to remember to scan them and send you copies because they're interesting.

121
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,919
He took young scholars seriously.

122
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,919
And what was your question now?

123
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,919
Oh, yes.

124
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:41,919
Well, the whole background to that is failing marriage to Karen.

125
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:49,919
And I'm not sure if Paul Buil was altogether right about Bill's...

126
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,919
Paul would argue that Bill's theme was that a woman's place was in the home.

127
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,919
And I'm not so sure about that.

128
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,919
And I'm not sure my wife would agree with that either.

129
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,919
But that's Paul's view.

130
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,919
And there's enough evidence to say that's true.

131
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:14,919
And Karen's restlessness of wanting to go on and get a degree as it turns out at Portland State

132
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,919
because they had a social work program.

133
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,919
I'm losing my train of thought, a response to your question.

134
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,919
Right.

135
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,919
We made friends with George Carson here.

136
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,919
And I think that's clear from recorded literature.

137
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,919
And they liked each other.

138
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,919
That was important.

139
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,919
And George was very bright and he was no one's fool.

140
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,919
And he liked Bill.

141
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,919
And then there were negotiations about the possibility of hiring Williams.

142
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,919
And the president at the time I think was Jensen.

143
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Yeah.

144
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:08,920
And Paul Buil has it that a dean was involved because there were questions raised about Bill's trustworthiness

145
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
because he was a radical and so forth.

146
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
And I remember Bill saying it was Jensen.

147
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,920
And that president Jensen put in a call to Fred Harvey Harrington.

148
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,920
And I don't know whether Harrington yet had become president of University of Wisconsin or not.

149
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,920
But asked him, and I remember Bill saying it was Jensen who called Harrington

150
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
and asked him if Williams was trustworthy.

151
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,920
And Bill said, Harrington said, he is.

152
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
And Bill, I remember him saying, I get the job.

153
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
And that's about all I can add.

154
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I know that there's correspondence, George Carson.

155
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
And I think Tom McClinick, Tom was sitting in, I know, for George.

156
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Part of the time when George was on leave.

157
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
So I don't know.

158
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
But all that correspondence is here.

159
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Did you have any sense of what a success went up?

160
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Did you have the part of what you defined to be right?

161
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Well, I hadn't changed much when I came here in 1971.

162
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,920
And, you know, there was a dearth of people publishing.

163
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,920
And that's been very kindly.

164
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,920
But that wasn't unusual in most land-bent universities in other places either.

165
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,920
One of the more active people publishing at the time in colonial history was Darryl Wax.

166
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,920
And he would, when Tom McClinick stepped down from being chair of the department,

167
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Darryl became chair of the department.

168
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Late 70s, something like this.

169
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,920
And so Darryl was chair through the rest of Bill's tenure on the faculty.

170
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:07,920
But other than that, you know, I, one well-known member of the faculty,

171
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,920
was promoted to full professor on the basis of three articles published.

172
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:20,920
And I was going up for a full professor the same year in the dean at the time,

173
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:30,920
who died a long time ago, tried to get me to draw my bid for promotion to full professor

174
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,920
because I hadn't been associate professor for very long either.

175
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,920
And, but I was publishing articles and I had a book in press.

176
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,920
And I remember it was just before the Christmas break and he asked me,

177
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,920
suggested that I would draw my candidacy.

178
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,920
And I was a little bit offended, but I was talking to the dean and I said that,

179
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,920
you know, I thought that I had the credentials.

180
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
My resume was strong enough for promotion.

181
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
And I had in mind this other person was going up for promotion.

182
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,920
And I assured him that I wasn't going to jump off to all buildings or anything if I was denied.

183
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
And anyway, it was turned down.

184
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,920
And I learned subsequently that the vote among the senior review team here was close.

185
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
So...

186
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,920
No, but I remember talking to the person who actually had become good friends with since.

187
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,920
Who told me and he got promoted was that you just have to wait your turn.

188
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Which didn't cheer my Irish sensibilities very much.

189
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,920
But those were interesting times.

190
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:59,920
And I was feisty, cocky in some ways, but I was publishing a lot.

191
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,920
And my first book was published in 1982.

192
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Bill read the introductory chapter.

193
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I'll never forget it before I sent it off for publication.

194
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Do you want to hear that story?

195
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I wrote it and rewrote it and revised it.

196
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,920
And until I was sure that it was near perfect.

197
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,920
And my wife, my family and I were living out on the Elsi highway at the time.

198
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,920
And we drove down our long driveway and for some reason she was driving.

199
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,920
And I reached in our mailbox and pulled out.

200
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,920
There it was with Williams's handwriting.

201
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,920
And I opened it up as we were driving into town and pulled out.

202
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,920
The manuscript and I told this to graduate students.

203
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Red pen.

204
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,920
It looked like he had cut himself and bled.

205
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Am I perfect writing?

206
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,920
But oh did I learn about writing?

207
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Not just redundancies, but repetitive word use.

208
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,920
The use of that in which, the proper use of that in which,

209
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,920
the proper use of these in those.

210
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,920
And those are only, I should have saved that.

211
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't think I have that anymore.

212
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,920
But it was a priceless piece of editorial work.

213
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,920
So it sounds like it became how I used to call these friends pretty quickly.

214
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
We did.

215
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,920
It's been a while to, as I used to say, when I first came here speaking to Bill,

216
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I always felt like I had a hot potato in my mouth.

217
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
But I got over that.

218
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:06,920
And I would say by 1973, 1974, you know, I was sort of beyond that.

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,920
And it became friends, and eventually very good friends.

220
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,920
I was divorced in 1972.

221
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,920
So Bill never met my first wife.

222
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,920
And I was single for three years.

223
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Bill and Wendy were married in fall of 1972, December of 1972.

224
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,920
They went to British Columbia, I think, to Vancouver.

225
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,920
And I didn't remarry until the summer of 1975.

226
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:54,920
And this is what Paul Bill misses in his biography of Bill Williams is his sense of play.

227
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
A profound sense of play.

228
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Even the memos he would write to the History Department, which are fun reading.

229
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Part of it is his sense of play.

230
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Sometimes it's very cryptic, but a beautiful sense of play.

231
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Bill and Wendy came to our wedding.

232
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:22,920
And when we walked out of the church, at the end of the ceremony,

233
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,920
tied to ornamentation on the outside of the church.

234
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,920
We're balloons brought by Bill.

235
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Well, my next question sort of fits along in this band.

236
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I'm interested to know a bit more about his personal.

237
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Yeah. Well, Paul mentions this in his biography.

238
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,920
But I don't think he struck how important it was to Bill.

239
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,920
As on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we would go down to the Krivales Hotel,

240
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,920
and the Krivales Hotel in the bottom floor that since long been gone,

241
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,920
were two great pool tables.

242
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,920
And you could buy beer or beverages there.

243
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,920
And we would shoot pool.

244
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,920
And Bill was the best pool player.

245
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,920
And there would be Ben Murgeck from our department,

246
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,920
who was kind of a crotchety cranky guy,

247
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,920
really a base of wonderful human being, but sometimes difficult to get along with.

248
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I mean, even for his best friends, one was Bill,

249
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
and I was a good friend of Ben's, too.

250
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Ben was a good pool player.

251
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Peter Kopeck, who was the founding director of the Center for Humanities,

252
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,920
was a regular there.

253
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,920
And there would be various others who would join for at different times.

254
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
But those were always wonderful get-togethers,

255
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,920
and then Bill would catch the Greyhound back to Newport.

256
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,920
That was part of it.

257
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Bill, what was the conversation like?

258
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Oh, it varied from politics to history to sports.

259
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,920
And I know there was a television set,

260
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,920
and it could have been after the Krivales Hotel closed,

261
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,920
and we moved on to somewhere else.

262
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,920
And I think it was, and I can't remember where we played pool after that.

263
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,920
But it was during the baseball playoffs,

264
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,920
and when Nolan Ryan pitched for that Houston Astros,

265
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,920
and Bill was a preeminent sports fan,

266
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,920
and especially baseball.

267
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,920
And he was enamored with watching Nolan Ryan pitch.

268
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Well, he was a pain in the neck when, you know, it was his turn to shoot,

269
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
and he's up watching television set watching Nolan Ryan pitch.

270
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,920
But Paul Beall misses that part of Bill's life,

271
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,920
and that was a very rich part of his life, too.

272
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,920
And you probably, I'm sure this is in my brief biography

273
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,920
of a sketch of Bill in the Fesheriff, a wonderful line,

274
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,920
and I think it was from Lloyd Gardner,

275
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,920
and not Walter LaFabre, that in his seminars,

276
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Bill would chide them during fall semester,

277
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
when the Yankees were always playing in the playoffs,

278
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
well, there was no playoffs then.

279
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
He simply won the American League Championship,

280
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
and went to the World Series,

281
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
and all of his graduate students would be anti.

282
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,920
They'd be Yankee haters, and Bill would chide them that they just,

283
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
they didn't understand power.

284
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,920
To understand power, you have to understand the Yankees.

285
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,920
It was neat to see how he could take sports metaphor

286
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,920
and switch it into a discussion of, you know,

287
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
his kind of history, his approach to history.

288
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Did you take an interest in the local teams?

289
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Oh, yes.

290
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,920
He was a very close fan of Ralph Miller's great basketball teams

291
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,920
in the late 70s and early 80s, really.

292
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,920
And he actually probably met Ralph on different occasions.

293
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,920
I can't remember the details, but he knew and liked him.

294
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,920
And he had Ralph's daughter Shannon in his class,

295
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
at some point.

296
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
And Shannon also was a student in one of my classes as well.

297
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,920
And she was on the woman's basketball team here,

298
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
and very good.

299
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Yes, right.

300
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,920
How would it seem to you then?

301
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Well, I've given you a flare for that already,

302
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I think his play with words, especially in memos to the history department,

303
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,920
which I think I saved most of them.

304
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,920
And you, over between my collection and whatever you gathered elsewhere,

305
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
they're great reading.

306
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,920
And they're also steeped in historical metaphors.

307
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,920
And what I always enjoyed about those is the sense of play.

308
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,920
That, you know, this was part fun, part humor, and so forth,

309
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,920
and that you never could take yourself all that seriously.

310
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,920
And I should have better responses to,

311
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
but that was part of Bill's persona, I think,

312
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,920
that you never take yourself all that seriously.

313
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,920
And I think that that's part of his differences

314
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,920
with Arthur Meyer, Slesinger, Jr.

315
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,920
was that Slesinger certainly took himself very seriously.

316
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,920
And I assume that this personality there is before itself about conversation.

317
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Oh, yes.

318
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I have to say one other thing.

319
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I told this to Paul Bill when he interviewed me,

320
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,920
when he was working on the biography, that Bill was,

321
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,920
I told him Bill was the best idea person I'd ever met.

322
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,920
And Paul came close to agreeing, but he had one other person in mind,

323
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
the best idea person he ever met.

324
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:41,920
And that's CLR James, the Caribbean Marxist Revolutionary,

325
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,920
and one of the greatest cricketers of all time.

326
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,920
You might check Paul's biography of CLR James.

327
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Where do you think this came from?

328
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Especially as exactly the brightness of this kind of thing?

329
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Well, you know, to use the old metaphor,

330
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,920
thinking outside the box, no one thought outside the box like Williams.

331
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
And Paul does a good job of that.

332
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:19,920
That he looked at that looked at historical questions

333
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,920
from the side or kind of an opaque view.

334
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,920
And he saw raised questions that no one ever raised before.

335
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Or thought about things in a unique and different way.

336
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,920
And that's what I think his work is so transformative in American foreign relations.

337
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Because, you know, old-style diplomatic history never looked at it

338
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,920
from the approach that Bill did, you know, in his book,

339
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,920
The Roots of the Modern American Empire is kind of a classic study

340
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,920
looking at agriculture and agriculture, American agriculture,

341
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,920
and its search for markets and the force that that had in the late 19th century

342
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,920
and shaping American foreign relations certainly is a powerful way of looking at that.

343
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Did you ever talk about the influences upon him and kind of developing the role of the beardless thing?

344
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Yeah. Oh, beard.

345
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,920
In fact, the beard would be a common point of discussion over the pool table.

346
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
And every once in a while, Lloyd Gardner or Walt Faeber,

347
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,920
somebody like that would come up with something out of the beard papers,

348
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
although beard burned all his papers, I think.

349
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,920
But it was a reference to beard that they found in somebody else's correspondence

350
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
and so forth, and he would share that with me,

351
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,920
and probably some of it maybe in what I've turned over

352
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,920
to the archives here, the collection.

353
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,920
So, yeah, beard was a constant point of reference.

354
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,920
And I, you know, of course, well aware of beard,

355
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:18,920
and especially his point about the influence on the shaping of America's early period of history

356
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,920
and especially the making the constitutional convention that the constitutional makers

357
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,920
were not some of our current politicians.

358
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Today descended from on high, but rather they had their hand in the cookie jar,

359
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,920
so that was part of my understanding, too, of political economy.

360
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Did you ever visit the first bread, that's a good point?

361
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,920
No. No. I don't even know where it was.

362
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,920
No. In fact, by the time Carla and I visited their wallpour,

363
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
and I think the two of us were there together,

364
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,920
I never visited Bill there alone, then he and Wendy were married by the time

365
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,920
I was making trips to the coast to visit them.

366
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,920
What Bill did was he bought two cabins,

367
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,920
and then when he and Wendy were married, they built a partition,

368
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,920
which housed a kitchen, a small dining room, and so forth.

369
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,920
And then one end became a study in their bedroom

370
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,920
and the other end was a living room.

371
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,920
And then eventually after we knew them several years,

372
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,920
they built a bigger bedroom and a garage over the other end.

373
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,920
But it was very livable and very appropriate for them,

374
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:55,920
and it backed up right on a bluff over the ocean, as you probably know.

375
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,920
We talked earlier before to write a study.

376
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,920
I wanted to be able to reiterate your recollections about that.

377
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,920
This was not recorded though, that was over coffee.

378
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Lostier, Spartan, beautiful desk, bookcase,

379
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,920
hardbound books, not many of them.

380
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:31,920
The study was not filled with wall-to-wall books.

381
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,920
It's the neatest study I've ever seen.

382
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:43,920
It's probably an expression of Bill's work.

383
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
You talked about this a little bit already.

384
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,920
How did the logistics work out of living on that building?

385
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Well, he had an agreement when he signed his contract

386
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,920
that he wouldn't have to be here every day,

387
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,920
because he wanted to live on the coast.

388
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,920
And, you know, wanted to teach a Tuesday, Thursday schedule.

389
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,920
And I know there was some resentment over that.

390
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,920
I was privy to it.

391
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,920
And I thought it was nonsense, because it came from people

392
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,920
who were doing nothing and had zero prestige

393
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,920
in terms of the historical profession.

394
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,920
And he, Bill gave his all to the department.

395
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,920
He did his share, taught his fair share of classes.

396
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,920
He advised students, and we had individual student advising,

397
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,920
probably not too many.

398
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Students who matriculated in his class, undergraduates,

399
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,920
I would say probably 98 percent of them

400
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,920
never knew who they were taking the class went.

401
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
And a striking example of this,

402
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,920
I was attending a Western history meeting in Sacramento,

403
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
and I was in an elevator,

404
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,920
and a fellow saw my identification card

405
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,920
for the conference, and asked me,

406
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,920
he said, will you map them?

407
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
William's still teaching.

408
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
And I said, yes.

409
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,920
He said, you know, I had a class with him as an undergraduate,

410
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
and I never knew who he was.

411
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,920
So that was kind of an eye-opener for me,

412
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
well, it was something I never forgot,

413
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,920
because, you know, wow.

414
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,920
So he would take the bus over in the morning teaching

415
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
and take it back.

416
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Yeah, and I think it was seven o'clock return bus,

417
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
and he would be home.

418
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Well, by the time I was here,

419
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,920
he was living in Walport,

420
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,920
and so he would leave his car in Newport,

421
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
or Wendy would drive, pick him up,

422
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
and something like that.

423
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
I don't know how that worked out.

424
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
So he didn't keep it apart the night?

425
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
No, he didn't.

426
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,920
And when he did stay over,

427
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,920
he stayed over Tuesday in Wednesday night,

428
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
because he had other commitments,

429
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
and he did that pretty regularly.

430
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,920
He stayed at the townhouse.

431
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,920
And it's still a townhouse, I guess, isn't it?

432
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
On South Forth,

433
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,920
and it's Tommy's bar and grill,

434
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,920
and then it was just the townhouse bar.

435
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,920
So we talked about the townhouse hotel

436
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
or the other house.

437
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,920
No, Creval's hotel,

438
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,920
and I can't remember where we migrated for a while,

439
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,920
and then the townhouse,

440
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
we would get together there

441
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,920
for drinks afterwards sometimes.

442
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Can't remember.

443
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,920
There is now, but.

444
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
I'm worried about 35 minutes.

445
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Yeah.

446
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Yeah, I'm watching I've got

447
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
about 18, 15 minutes or so.

448
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,920
How do you characterize his work style?

449
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Well, I have to back up

450
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,920
because by the time we were talking about

451
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,920
writing drafts of papers and so forth,

452
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,920
and he would use long yellow pads.

453
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
He called it full-skap,

454
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,920
and I don't know if that's probably,

455
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,920
you know, a really 20th century term,

456
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,920
and I used the eight half by 11 pads

457
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
now they're lined and so forth,

458
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
and he used the longer ones,

459
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
14 inch, I suspect,

460
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,920
and he would write drafts of material

461
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
on that in long hand,

462
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,920
and then he would transfer that,

463
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,920
he would type it on a first rough draft

464
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,920
after doing some editing.

465
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
So by the time he was doing that,

466
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
it was more or less a third draft

467
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,920
that he was typing by the time he did that,

468
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I know that was part of his routine.

469
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
And beyond that, you know,

470
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
after he had, if he was writing,

471
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
let's say, empires a way of life

472
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
or something,

473
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
the process of revision,

474
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
you know, once he had a manuscript

475
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,920
completed, you know,

476
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I tend to go back through,

477
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,920
well, chapters individually,

478
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
and then the whole manuscript.

479
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,920
But that's, of course,

480
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm using computers

481
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,920
and Bill never graduated

482
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
to use the use of computers,

483
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
but he was a fast typist too.

484
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,920
And Prone, pretty error-free, I think.

485
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
I mean, if you look at his typescripts there,

486
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
pretty good.

487
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
So those three days in the coast were generally

488
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,920
developed three days right in that?

489
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
I would say yes,

490
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
and some of it,

491
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,920
late night,

492
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
you know, he tended to work at night,

493
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,920
and that was a habit he developed,

494
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,920
you know, probably when he taught at the Uvoa

495
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,920
and certainly when he was in Madison.

496
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Yeah, that was part of the certain

497
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
circumstances that he was having to raise kids.

498
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
He had a house full of children,

500
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
you know, two of Carrins,

501
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,920
and then he and Carrin had three children at their home.

502
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
And then he, at some point,

503
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
it seems to have initially sort of presented

504
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
having to do that,

505
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
but maybe he came up with that.

506
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Yeah, I don't know.

507
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
I think he worked.

508
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
You know, I mean,

509
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
he was so incredibly productive then.

510
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,920
In addition to turning out

511
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,920
42 PhDs in 11 years.

512
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
You imagine that.

513
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Yeah.

514
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Now some of them were still finishing up,

515
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,920
obviously, when he was here.

516
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,920
And I don't know when he told me at one point,

517
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,920
you know, he had placed his last candidate in a job.

518
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
And that could have been the mid-70s

519
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,920
and it might have been Peggy Morley or Henry Berger.

520
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I can't remember whom.

521
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,920
You talked a bit about tragedy and concert

522
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
as being hugely influential books.

523
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,920
There's sort of a sense that his scholarship kind of declined

524
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,920
a little bit in terms of quality during the OSU.

525
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Did you comment on that?

526
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Well, he said he would never write another book.

527
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
And actually my wife and I called him on it

528
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,920
when he published Empires a Way of Life.

529
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,920
And actually America confronts a revolutionary world.

530
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,920
I think he even made that comment before that book.

531
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
But he didn't call those books.

532
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
He called them extended essays.

533
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
So, there was a difference.

534
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,920
And well, then you could call tragedy of American diplomacy,

535
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
you know, an extended essay.

536
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Whether, you know, like his first book American Russian relations

537
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,920
or roots in the modern American empire

538
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
which were detailed.

539
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Annotated, documented books.

540
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Maybe he called those books, I don't know.

541
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,920
But I would say I was never enamored

542
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,920
by America confronts a revolutionary world.

543
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,920
But Empires a Way of Life is an incredible piece of writing.

544
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,920
And I was telling my friend Sunday,

545
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
a historian who was visiting our home,

546
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
that Empires a Way of Life.

547
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,920
I don't know how many different languages it's been translated into.

548
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,920
You probably know.

549
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, French.

550
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Add infinitum.

551
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,920
And it's a testimony to the influence of his career,

552
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
the body of his work.

553
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,920
And I think as a capsule,

554
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,920
and my reading of Paul Beall kind of reminded me of this,

555
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,920
is how important that book is.

556
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,920
After reading Paul's biography,

557
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,920
I want to go back and read Empires.

558
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,920
That's part of this sort of drawing,

559
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,920
documentation of the idea of community.

560
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
And it seemed like that was one of the world-of-fine things

561
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
with the intelligence.

562
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Yeah, a lot of people have asked me about that.

563
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,920
And think, you know, because I was Bill's good friend for so many years

564
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,920
that I knew more than, you know,

565
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,920
the snippets that he published here and there about community.

566
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,920
But community and democracy were the small D.

567
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,920
And pretty much everything it's in is writing.

568
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,920
You know, there's nothing hidden anywhere else.

569
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,920
It's kind of an exploration, an exploration of ideas.

570
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,920
I think that he was interested in.

571
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,920
That's what it's what it's all about.

572
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Oh, I think it all has its roots in Atlantic Iowa,

573
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,920
which I stopped in there on a Sunday morning

574
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,920
when I was traveling from east to west.

575
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,920
I think I was back east and I was coming west and had breakfast.

576
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,920
And, you know, it's like a lot of other small Iowa towns

577
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,920
you drive in and you find a diner and, you know,

578
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,920
you're going in a Sunday morning, everyone is there for breakfast.

579
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
And I don't remember much about it.

580
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,920
Did he ever reflect on Atlantic around you?

581
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Oh, yes.

582
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
Yeah.

583
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Yeah.

584
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,920
And his grandparents.

585
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
And it's funny.

586
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,920
He makes, Paul makes more of Mildred.

587
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,920
I think then, Mod, his grandmother.

588
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,920
But, Mod and what's his name?

589
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,920
His grandfather, Tossi, Appleman.

590
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Porter.

591
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Porter.

592
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Porter, Inkler, Appleman.

593
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,920
They were a real presence in his life.

594
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,920
And, you know, Paul makes, I think,

595
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,920
a more of a psychological play on, you know,

596
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,920
the boy who grew up without a father or something.

597
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,920
And, Porter was a pretty pronounced presence in his life.

598
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,920
And, you know, my association with Bill,

599
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,920
I mean, his grandparents were very important.

600
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:42,920
And he was very proud of his mother, of course.

601
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,920
I have one other thing I want to say about his upbringing in Atlantic

602
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,920
and he makes mention of 1927.

603
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,920
So, Bill would have been six years old, maybe seven years old,

604
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,920
when Charles Lindbergh flew over Atlantic,

605
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,920
and supposedly yet, his father's.

606
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,920
This may be an apocryl story.

607
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,920
And, Bill remembers seeing the plane in the dipping of the wing

608
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,920
on his fourth.

609
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,920
I've always wondered about that.

610
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,920
My bill was a good storyteller, very good storyteller.

611
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,920
So, I wonder if this is something fashionable that, you know,

612
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,920
he remembers from his childhood and so forth.

613
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,920
And, I tend to have those same, it's probably romantic notions,

614
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,920
myself, about my own childhood.

615
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,920
I think we have a scrapbook actually,

616
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
is that right?

617
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,920
Well, then, it's not an apocryl story.

618
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm interested to know more about his teaching style.

619
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,920
It was eclectic,

620
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,920
psychratic.

621
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,920
He wanted to engage students in dialogue.

622
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,920
And, I would say it probably worked greatly for sophisticated,

623
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,920
older students, and not sophisticated, but with inquiring minds.

624
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,920
And, I know because I tried it myself.

625
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,920
And, it worked one term, then I tried it with a larger class.

626
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,920
And, I had to give it up,

627
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,920
and went back to lecturing.

628
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,920
And, I would have a lecture format, a framework of discussion in mind.

629
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:48,920
But, I don't know Bill, you know, he was a master at that.

630
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,920
And, I think that he would lecture from a general outline.

631
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,920
He would just have three pieces of paper with notes in his beautiful penmanship.

632
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,920
And, but they were profound.

633
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,920
When I was away at a conference one time, he met with a night class that I taught.

634
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:17,920
And, he left me with, it was a colonial history class.

635
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
And, it was very early fall term.

636
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,920
And, he left me with a copy of the notes.

637
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,920
And, they're in my papers in your collection.

638
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,920
And, they were, I mean, it was unbelievable.

639
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:42,920
The world view of what the coming of Europeans to the American continent did.

640
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:50,920
And, I used to do it in more immediate ways.

641
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:57,920
Bill's, however, was framed into how you impose on a people new languages,

642
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,920
new frames of reference, new world views, and so forth.

643
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,920
And, I'd have to go back and look at it.

644
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:20,920
But, I even put that in one of my books, incited his, it's very profound.

645
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,920
So, you came to us to a university about a graduate program,

646
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,920
do you have a sense of frustration that arose out of any of that?

647
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
No, no.

648
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Despite what Paul Bill said, I think.

649
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,920
One of the reasons for coming here was to get away from training graduate students,

650
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,920
because he had enough of training graduate students.

651
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,920
And, he wanted to settle in a place where he didn't have to shovel snow in the winter.

652
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
And, he wanted to be close to the ocean.

653
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
People have asked me about this.

654
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,920
You know, at conferences, when they first learned that I taught at Oregon State in Bill Williams,

655
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
I was like, why does he want to come there?

656
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,920
And, I would repeat these three reasons.

657
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,920
And, I had never heard, never heard him say anything other than that.

658
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,920
He told that to interviewers.

659
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:25,920
He would tell it to Carla and me, when he'd had a couple of bourbons,

660
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,920
and he'd never said anything else.

661
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,920
How about the quality of the student scale, anger, or institution?

662
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,920
Well, I think there was some sense of frustration with that, obviously.

663
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,920
But, he would be very proud of some of the papers his students did.

664
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Here, I know that from time to time.

665
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,920
My impression is that he was a fairly demanding person expected a lot of his students.

666
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,920
Yeah, I'm not sure that he was all that rigorous of a grader.

667
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,920
I can't, you know, I was less interested in those kinds of things.

668
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,920
And, you mentioned that they would do a lot of advice.

669
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,920
Well, it's hard to say.

670
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,920
He did have, you know, we all shared advising.

671
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,920
And, usually, they were students from our own classes.

672
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:36,920
And, so we would have advisees assigned that way.

673
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,920
I had huge classes.

674
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,920
I know, in the 70s, I was teaching Indian history.

675
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,920
And, I was, in fact, in retrospect, overburdened with students.

676
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:58,920
I had to use different kinds of roosters to go through grading exams and so forth.

677
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,920
Yeah, I'm interested in my as time to move on.

678
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,920
What sort of role would he assume within the department?

679
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
He's never at the chair of the department.

680
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
He mentioned that some of this initially was hired.

681
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Right.

682
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,920
Do that resistance disappear?

683
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Do you become kind of a mentor to some of the junior faculty?

684
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Well, I know some of the resentment early on when I was hired.

685
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:38,920
So, I had a lot of jealousy accusations that Williams was trying to develop a department full of radical young people and so forth.

686
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:53,920
And, part of it was focused on me and part of it was focused on a young French historian that the department hired to teach African history and French history.

687
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,920
And, this fellow was very bright.

688
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,920
He was very flawed and he never got tenure.

689
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:14,920
I think by the time this fellow was denied tenure and that was, let's say, by 76 or so, he was gone.

690
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
That had fallen by the wayside.

691
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,920
But that was very prevalent at first.

692
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:29,920
One of the best pieces I thought of that appeared in Northwest newspapers.

693
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
And, I don't know the exact date.

694
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:42,920
It was a piece that Foster Church published in the Sunday Oregonian and had to be about 1983, 84, something like that.

695
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,920
I don't know what the exact was, but I know I clipped a copy of that.

696
00:50:47,920 --> 00:51:03,920
I don't know whether, I'm sure you have it, but it's, and the best part of that I think is the photograph of Bill on the back deck of his home looking south along the coast.

697
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,920
It's a great photograph. It's on the back of Paul's book too.

698
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,920
So, I'm just continuing on. Is there anything more to talk about in terms of the role that he was in within the department of overtime?

699
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:30,920
No, except the overweaning jealousy thing that I've mentioned just before we break, took the break, was something that bothered me.

700
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:49,920
And part of it I think had to do with those of us who were really interested in building a department in which people published, taught, and engaged in the professional meetings, gave papers, and so forth.

701
00:51:49,920 --> 00:52:06,920
And those who didn't, and I think that some of that went away by the time of Bill's retirement, 1985, but there were still sharp divisions in the department.

702
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:27,920
And between what kind of was the quasi progressive Williams faction and those opposed, and it was pretty pronounced, and it lasted until I served one year as department chair.

703
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:36,920
And I did nothing brilliant, but there were four people in the department who came to me, and I was an interim appointment.

704
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:48,920
At different times, during the first, right after I was named, Acting Chair, and expressed, you know, real concern about the direction of the department.

705
00:52:48,920 --> 00:53:16,920
And what I told them was that, you know, I was a Democrat with a lowercase D, and that I had no intention of making end runs around people, or pushing any special direction in the department, any ideological agendas.

706
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:25,920
And by that time, however, the department was changing a lot. There was a cadre of people who had published books, you had to have a book to get tenure and so forth.

707
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:45,920
And by the time I was through with my year, three of those four people came to me and told me what a good job I was doing, and I wasn't doing anything brilliant, except, you know, we were a different department than, and those kinds of factions went away.

708
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:59,920
But that was part of, you know, the hangover from Bill's presence here. You know, he was president of the Organization of American Historians for Health, you know, in 1981.

709
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:07,920
How much does his presence within the university, is he regarding to be something for a star or celebrity?

710
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Oh, yes. I mean, people knew who he was, and presidents knew who he was. He actually got on well with John Byrne, and you should interview John.

711
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Yeah. You know, because Bill assumed, with good reason, that he could speak to John Byrne as an equal, and there weren't many faculty, I don't think, who presumed that they would speak to the president of the university as an equal.

712
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,920
And Bill did.

713
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:57,920
Bill also played a great role, and you'd have to look into the records of the Center for the Humanities, and getting the Center a major endowment.

714
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:09,920
And it became part of the university, not the foundation, what's the development, OSU foundation.

715
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:17,920
They had four major objectives in a push, and one was the Center for the Humanities, and Bill was a major player in that.

716
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:35,920
And obviously, because of his prestige, his stature and the profession, and he lent his voice to that, and I'm sure that the Center, and I know Peter Copeck, was always very thankful to Bill for that.

717
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:43,920
Was that, was the Center something that the, Peter, that is sort of a commitment, and brought in to play over?

718
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,920
No, it was Peter's idea. So Williams was enlisted.

719
00:55:46,920 --> 00:56:03,920
Williams was enlisted. Yeah, Bill was not a player. It began as the Humanities Development Office, over in Moreland Hall, and it kind of morphed beyond there, and then when it became a full-blown Center for the Humanities,

720
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:16,920
that's when Bill was brought in as a good friend of Peter's, along with a few other people, and he was a major force in how that worked out.

721
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:28,920
We talked about the social setting, the pool table, if larger kinds of gatherings and professional gatherings perhaps received this sort of person who enjoyed hanging in the room, or did he?

722
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,920
No, no.

723
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,920
So you talked a little bit more about how you sort of operated in that situation?

724
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
Well, Department of meetings?

725
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,920
No, it might get a professional gathering of sorts.

726
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:56,920
No, I, he was, I'm people like to talk to him, and I've only been around him at professional meetings when he was with his former graduate students, who were, they were friends.

727
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:06,920
I mean, they were former graduate students. There was Lloyd Gardner and Walter LaFabre, Ed Craypole and others. They were just dear friends.

728
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:23,920
He liked them, they liked him, and when they came here to give talks, Bill would introduce Lloyd, or Walt LaFabre, as someone he knew when he first started teaching at the University of Wisconsin,

729
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:33,920
and he said, you know, it's like your students are smarter than you are, or something, you know, he paid them great compliments.

730
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:51,920
And I, I just remember my first social occasion, Carlo was with me, when Bill, the organization American Historians was meeting in San Francisco, and we were at the Hyatt Regency down on the waterfront.

731
00:57:51,920 --> 00:58:03,920
And it was late in the afternoon, cocktail hour, and kind of a rotating bar at the top, you sat and you'd see the San Francisco, or the Bay Area, skyline all around.

732
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:14,920
And, and Carlo and I were there with Walter LaFabre, Lloyd Gardner. I don't think Ed Craypole was there.

733
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:21,920
I don't remember Jerry McCauley being there, but a couple of other people from the organization American Historians.

734
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:43,920
And, you know, it was a fun gathering, and Lloyd Gardner was probably the most garrulous of the group, and because Lloyd had, you always had a glint in his eye about some devilish story, and he was a better storyteller in some ways than Bill.

735
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,920
You know, and Bill was just part of the crowd.

736
00:58:50,920 --> 00:59:08,920
Yes, he was. It was recognition, long deferred. As Paul Biel says, Eugene Genevase had been president three years prior to Bill, and, you know, it's funny.

737
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:22,920
People who have controversial or quasi-radical positions, you know, become presidents of major organizations long after the fact.

738
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:34,920
One of, I just learned in my own field of Western American history, Donald Worcester is the forthcoming president of the Western History Association, and he's retiring.

739
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:48,920
And, Don, in a lot of our views, should have been president, you know, in the early 1980s, when he was publishing, you know, good books. He's published good books ever since then.

740
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:58,920
But he's been a person who's been a bit edgy, like, maybe not as much as Williams, but he's finally going to be president.

741
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,920
And he knew Bill spent time in this house.

742
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,920
And this was not a biographic story, so you had an adventure that you were trying to do.

743
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Yes, he did. And he worked very hard in his year as president, and started, I think, something that girdle learner

744
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:29,920
who finished, who followed Bill as president, gave him a lot of credit for his initiatives, although they didn't bear fruit, you know, especially with the national endowment for humanities.

745
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:39,920
He got nowhere. He appealed to several historians who wrote, made thousands of dollars writing textbooks.

746
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:49,920
He had ten or fifteen of them in mind, and he wanted each one of them to donate a thousand dollars to create this.

747
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,920
And he put five grand in himself to do this, and to no avail.

748
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:02,920
A lot of the lines is sort of a bit further to honoris that we mentioned earlier at the college.

749
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,920
Also, I would only see one on our adoptee.

750
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Yeah.

751
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:15,920
I'm Paul makes mention of that.

752
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,920
My answer is so what?

753
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:33,920
No, no. When he did get the honorary doctorate at Columbia College or something in Chicago, his address had to do with Duke Wellington.

754
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:44,920
I remember that. I remember reading the talk. He would give Carl and I copies of his talks.

755
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:51,920
Oh, yes. Love jazz. Yeah. Miles Davis.

756
01:01:51,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Pretty close. Dizzy Gillespie. Who's the one I just mentioned?

757
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:07,920
No. Duke Wellington. Yeah. Yeah. They were kind of classic jazz.

758
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:18,920
And I know when we would go to the coast, he invariably have Miles Davis on his stereo.

759
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,920
What were some of the other hobbies that you had to take for a jazz?

760
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:30,920
He fished. The ocean. I went fishing with him once. We didn't catch anything. We went down in the rocks and yajas.

761
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,920
And I had to stop in a store when I was coming through Wallport to get some bait.

762
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,920
And then I drove up to Bill's place and then we drove south to Yajas.

763
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,920
He liked to fish. We have some of his photography in our house.

764
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,920
And his photography goes back to evidently his childhood.

765
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:00,920
And we have a... I don't think you have a copy of it, but here I doubt.

766
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,920
Of a photograph that he took when he was a student in anapolis.

767
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:10,920
And it is striking. I mean, it's so damn creative.

768
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:19,920
He climbed up on a trancem over one of the major public buildings at the Naval Academy.

769
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,920
And on a Sunday in the sunlight, it's shining through the door.

770
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:34,920
And people who walk through when they're approaching, they cast shadows.

771
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,920
And there was a woman evidently approaching the door.

772
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:44,920
And he captured her shadow from a pie over the trancem.

773
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,920
And we have it framed in our house.

774
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,920
And it's a... what do you call it?

775
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,920
Maybe a marble in laid floor, something black and white.

776
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,920
And it's a black and white photograph.

777
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,920
And I imagine it may be black and white in real life.

778
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:09,920
And then he would take close-ups of items along the coast,

779
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:16,920
like a rusty hinge somewhere real close to the water,

780
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,920
or gnarly wood that had been weathered and so forth.

781
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,920
And we have several of those. Those were wedding gifts.

782
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,920
And he had photographic exhibits too.

783
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:36,920
I know Paul mentioned when the new bridge was being built in Walport across the LC.

784
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,920
That's the only photographic exhibit that I know he did.

785
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,920
He may have done others.

786
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,920
But that was one of his applications.

787
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,920
And Paul mentions that he went back to building model airplanes again.

788
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Later, after he retired.

789
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,920
Do you have any of those here?

790
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,920
No, the photographs or the model airplane.

791
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,920
What happened to them?

792
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,920
Ward. His son Ward may have them.

793
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,920
He'd be a good person to interview.

794
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:23,920
There's several references in the biography.

795
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,920
And no, that's well known.

796
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,920
And I don't think Wendy liked that in the biography.

797
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,920
She didn't like the references to womanizing.

798
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,920
And I know this.

799
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,920
She was visiting us, staying with us actually,

800
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,920
when we lived in Fulhamon.

801
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:55,920
And my only response to Wendy was that I had been with Bill in thick and thin

802
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:02,920
when he was drunk, sober, or he never was really drunk.

803
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,920
Or points in between.

804
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,920
And he never ever said anything negative about Wendy.

805
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,920
I had to tell her that.

806
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,920
And I remember, I had tears in my eyes.

807
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,920
I said, Wendy, you have to know this.

808
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,920
And he also could recover dramatically.

809
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,920
And I know that on the eve of his introduction of,

810
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:35,920
I can't remember the guy who the president-elect introduces the president.

811
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,920
It's a very prominent historian.

812
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,920
And I can't think of his name right at the moment.

813
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,920
In 1981, when we were at the Hyatt Regency,

814
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:49,920
Carla and I sat in a lounge with Bill that afternoon.

815
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,920
And Bill had, he might have had a drink or two before.

816
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,920
And then he had another one with us.

817
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,920
And boy, he was, like I said, he had Bill.

818
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:06,920
You know, you have to introduce so and so at eight o'clock for his presidential address.

819
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,920
And he said, OK.

820
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,920
So he goes to his room and he naps.

821
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,920
And we saw him at the dinner, I think.

822
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,920
And it was like, you know, he never had a drink.

823
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,920
I'm really interested in this newspaper column.

824
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
Oh, they were great.

825
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,920
Yeah, I loved them.

826
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,920
I saved a lot of them, but I'm sure I missed several.

827
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,920
I used to clip them and put them in a file.

828
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,920
It seems like such an unusual,

829
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,920
thanks for a story to you on such a regular basis.

830
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,920
Yeah.

831
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,920
With respect to you sharing these papers,

832
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,920
are you unusual for these papers?

833
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,920
Yes.

834
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,920
Yes.

835
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,920
It started with the Statesman Journal,

836
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,920
because he knew one of the executives in the Statesman Journal,

837
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,920
and I can't remember whom, and they liked Ed Bassett.

838
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,920
And they liked each other.

839
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,920
And so that's how it started.

840
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,920
And he got so, and he used to tell me about this,

841
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,920
the number, the word limits.

842
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,920
You know, and how you take an idea and develop,

843
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,920
you know, an essay and you get it down to,

844
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,920
I don't know what is 700 words,

845
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,920
or something like this, whatever the column is.

846
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,920
And, you know, he became very good at it.

847
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,920
And then, I don't know, it was a changing command at the Statesman.

848
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,920
I think he started with the Statesman,

849
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,920
then the Statesman Journal, they merged the two papers did.

850
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,920
And then he migrated to the Oregonian.

851
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,920
And he did that, the Oregonian for a while.

852
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,920
And I think that probably happened in part through David Sarasant,

853
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,920
who was in his early period with the Oregonian.

854
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:01,920
And then they killed a piece that he wrote.

855
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,920
And they paid him, you know, the kill fee, never again.

856
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,920
That was it.

857
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
You know?

858
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,920
Well, it's a real testament.

859
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,920
I mean, he took that as an affront.

860
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Yeah.

861
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:24,920
So, the column, I think, is a real testament to that idea that he has.

862
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,920
Mm-hmm.

863
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,920
And they're very eclectic.

864
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,920
Yeah.

865
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,920
Yeah.

866
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:37,920
I talked about a lot of this.

867
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,920
I guess I'm interested in going more about trying to spend with Wendy

868
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,920
at sort of recollections of the wall for it.

869
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,920
Our collective visits to wall for it.

870
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,920
We always had a lot of fun.

871
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,920
And invariably, we would go out to dinner.

872
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,920
Occasionally with friends.

873
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
We would go down there.

874
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,920
They'd have friends over.

875
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:08,920
And the people I remember best were a couple named Barbara and Rob Davidson.

876
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,920
And they were a lot of fun.

877
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,920
Rob was quite a bit older than Barbara.

878
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,920
And he passed on eventually.

879
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,920
And I've seen Barbara just a couple of years ago.

880
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,920
And she's since remarried.

881
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,920
And she was a very good friend of Wendy's.

882
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,920
But Bill liked both of them.

883
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,920
And he liked Barbara, I know immensely.

884
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,920
And they were fun people.

885
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Occasionally they would have people from the OSU community over just a handful.

886
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:53,920
One of them was a fellow who retired in engineering David Bella.

887
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,920
Yeah.

888
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,920
Now, you might want to interview him.

889
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,920
David's kind of a kind of class in his own right.

890
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,920
You'll talk to your ear off.

891
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,920
That's where we met Dave.

892
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Dave was a really young professor.

893
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,920
Bill thought I know a lot of him.

894
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,920
He liked people with good ideas and so forth.

895
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,920
And he prided himself on that.

896
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,920
Dave was over there one time.

897
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,920
I can't remember anyone from the department.

898
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,920
A fellow named Jim Cole, who was here, is a visiting professor.

899
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,920
Jim was a good friend of Bill's.

900
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,920
But Jim was kind of crazy.

901
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,920
By me Bill would say that.

902
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,920
Jim would admit that himself.

903
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,920
And he was undisciplined.

904
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,920
Bill Meekam.

905
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,920
He's the fellow who didn't get tenure who came from Wisconsin.

906
01:11:51,920 --> 01:12:01,920
It was actually a Harvey Goldberg student and a radical guy.

907
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,920
And Bill had all kinds of problems.

908
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,920
It was booze and couldn't primarily booze.

909
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,920
I think he couldn't finish his dissertation.

910
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,920
But he couldn't get anything published.

911
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,920
And that was his own failing.

912
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,920
And I was good friends with Bill Meekam too.

913
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,920
So together is it really better conversation?

914
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:39,920
Yeah, or just snack food and drinks and talking about music and just for a couple of hours.

915
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,920
Bill and Wendy did.

916
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,920
We had a bridge.

917
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,920
Carl and I never played bridge.

918
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,920
So we were probably from people from the valley.

919
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,920
We were probably over there more often than anyone else.

920
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,920
And on special occasions, Wendy's birthday.

921
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,920
We'd go to New York Hots for dinner.

922
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:13,920
One time we went over, I think, during the Christmas New Year's holiday.

923
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
Carl and I stayed.

924
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,920
Our kids were getting a little bit older then.

925
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:27,920
So we left them in a motel and went into YAHOT's for dinner with Bill and Wendy.

926
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:34,920
And then we would call them every hour to make sure the kids were okay.

927
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,920
By then, they were at seven, eight years older.

928
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,920
Talk a little bit more about Wendy.

929
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:49,920
Well, she was her own person.

930
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,920
And very, very bright.

931
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,920
And very hardworking.

932
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
She loved to garden.

933
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,920
Bill built her a little greenhouse.

934
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,920
Plastic.

935
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:12,920
She had two pots and so forth.

936
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,920
She also played the piano.

937
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,920
And she worked in a gift shop up in Newport that's still operating.

938
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,920
And I can't remember the name.

939
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,920
If my wife were here, she would remember.

940
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:33,920
And she was a very hardworking woman.

941
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,920
Very bright, very political.

942
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:43,920
And I think that's where their friendship, certainly,

943
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,920
materialized because of Bill's politics.

944
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:55,920
And Wendy, a Brit who came to Corvallas via British Columbia,

945
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:02,920
was kind of keen on somebody who had politics that she appreciated.

946
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,920
So his fellowship was something that they would discuss?

947
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,920
I'm sure.

948
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,920
And she read voraciously.

949
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,920
I don't think she ever edited anything at Bill Road.

950
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:25,920
When he made public talks, he might just have her read it just to try it out on her.

951
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,920
There was something that he'd gone astray on or something.

952
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,920
Carl and Wendy were very good friends.

953
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,920
And we remain good friends to this day.

954
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,920
So we talked about his love to see you a little bit.

955
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,920
I don't know if there's anything more to share.

956
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,920
There I'm interested to in the maritime history class that he developed.

957
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,920
Yeah.

958
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,920
The two were one.

959
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,920
Just to give you a quick answer.

960
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,920
The maritime history class actually originated, I think, in part

961
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,920
through the Center for Humanities.

962
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,920
I know there were various of us.

963
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,920
I wrote a course that I taught on community through the Center for Humanities.

964
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Bill did the maritime course, and there were some others.

965
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:21,920
And I think I can't remember the details, but we got some stipend or something

966
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,920
for doing that wasn't much.

967
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,920
And that was kind of an application for Bill, you know,

968
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:38,920
touring off and part of his affection for this sea and maritime history and so forth

969
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,920
to do something like that.

970
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:46,920
And you got interested, of course, in the Chinese early Navy and the famous Southern

971
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:53,920
who was 11th or 12th century, famous Chinese who I saw his name in Paul's book the other day.

972
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,920
I can't remember his last name.

973
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,920
I had gone out on the high seas and came back and scuttled the Navy.

974
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:08,920
And Bill used that, you know, as a metaphor for no empire, which I love.

975
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:14,920
And he wrote a paper having to do with something to that effect.

976
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:25,920
And he was going to read it at the Pacific Coast Branch Meeting of the American Historical Association

977
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,920
in Honolulu in 1996.

978
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:36,920
And I was there presenting a paper on another panel and Bill something happened to him

979
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,920
and he couldn't make the trip.

980
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,920
Not in 1996, 86.

981
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,920
And it could have been another meeting of the PCV.

982
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,920
It was about that time, late.

983
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,920
It was 86 or 87, 88, maybe somewhere else.

984
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,920
But anyway, he couldn't make the trip and I read his paper.

985
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,920
And I had a lot of fun doing it because there were a couple of people on the panel

986
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:09,920
they commented was a person whose area of expertise was Chinese history.

987
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:16,920
And there were bills venturing in this paper talking about Chinese commander and so forth.

988
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:22,920
And I had to add a bit of humor to it and I told them why Bill couldn't be there.

989
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:32,920
And I said, I refused to defend this paper because I know nothing about the subject or something like that.

990
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Anyway, but it was received very well, including the commentary.

991
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:47,920
And somebody else made very nice compliments to the paper because no one else in American history

992
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:54,920
was thinking in these venues unless they were specialists in Chinese history or anything.

993
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,920
And Bill had the guts to venture out.

994
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,920
It's interesting to me that he taught this class at a community college.

995
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,920
Yeah, he taught it here too.

996
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,920
And then he taught it at the Co-security College for a while.

997
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,920
I don't know how successful that was.

998
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Well, of course, it's helped the client, if you'd like.

999
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:27,920
I don't know, to what extent did it reflect on that of any thoughts or memories you might have to share?

1000
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:37,920
You know, I know he, the week before he died, the cancer massacized.

1001
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:45,920
And he kind of had a stroke because he came walking down the hallway and he was gesturing to Wendy.

1002
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,920
He couldn't speak or anything.

1003
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,920
And within five days, I think he was dead.

1004
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:59,920
And Carla and I went over and saw him in the hospital.

1005
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:05,920
David Cleaver, who was a famous physician in Corvallis, was a good friend of Bill's.

1006
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,920
And David was there when we were there.

1007
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:14,920
And he explained, you know, he said he's semi-comatose or something.

1008
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,920
His eyes could open a little bit, but he wasn't corresponding or anything.

1009
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,920
And he was under morphine then.

1010
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,920
And he was on the way out.

1011
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,920
Wendy, of course, had worked in hospitals, a lot of her life.

1012
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,920
And she knew that the end was near.

1013
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,920
I felt bad.

1014
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,920
I told Wendy, you know, because I was busy with my own work.

1015
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,920
And I enjoyed going over to talk to Bill.

1016
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:52,920
And I would just drive over and have coffee with him or something like that.

1017
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,920
And I felt badly because I hadn't been over for a month.

1018
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,920
And she put my soul to rest.

1019
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:04,920
And she said, that's neither here nor there.

1020
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,920
What was the local reaction?

1021
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,920
Well, this is something I learned.

1022
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,920
And I learned this from Ed Craypole.

1023
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:24,920
I always thought that Bill and Wendy went to the Episcopal Church because of Wendy's influence.

1024
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,920
And I was totally wrong.

1025
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,920
That was Bill's choice to go to the Episcopal Church.

1026
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:41,920
And he was, I don't know whether he helped with, you know, the sacraments or something.

1027
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,920
I don't know.

1028
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,920
But Wendy went just to accompany him.

1029
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,920
Wendy was out.

1030
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,920
And is a radical quaker.

1031
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:55,920
Her sister, her husband, Alan, her Wendy's brother, Alan.

1032
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:01,920
They're in the truest, radical quaker tradition in England.

1033
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,920
And it was Bill, Ed Craypole told me this.

1034
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,920
So I said, you mean Bill is high church, not Wendy?

1035
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,920
And he said, yes.

1036
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,920
So Ed Craypole is the guy you should talk to about that.

1037
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,920
That was striking to me.

1038
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Yeah.

1039
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:29,920
And I think, and I was reading between the lines and what Paul said that his kind of sense for order and maybe hierarchy

1040
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,920
or something later in his life attracted him to the Episcopal Church.

1041
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,920
And I don't know what his church bringing wasn't Episcopalian.

1042
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,920
I don't think in Atlantic.

1043
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:48,920
But I do remember that.

1044
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,920
Well, is there anything else that we should touch on?

1045
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,920
No, I do want to have one final thing.

1046
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:03,920
And Bill's passing is something akin to my mother's passing.

1047
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,920
And she was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 60.

1048
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:13,920
And right after she had retired as a factory worker.

1049
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:21,920
And I had obviously an immediate period of grieving.

1050
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:30,920
But when I went back east for going through a wake, my father was Catholic.

1051
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,920
My mother wasn't, but my father wasn't a practicing Catholic.

1052
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,920
But he just thought, you know, there's people who die need wake.

1053
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,920
So we had this damn wake.

1054
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:47,920
And I met my mother's friends from the factory, who came in by the droves.

1055
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,920
And I never shed a tear.

1056
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,920
And it was nice to meet all these people.

1057
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:03,920
And Bill's passing is somewhat like my mother's because my mother has a living presence in my life.

1058
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,920
Bill has a living presence in my life.

1059
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,920
I mean, I remember him as the conversations happened yesterday.

1060
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,920
And that's healthy.

1061
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,920
Thank you, Jerry.

1062
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,920
You're welcome.
