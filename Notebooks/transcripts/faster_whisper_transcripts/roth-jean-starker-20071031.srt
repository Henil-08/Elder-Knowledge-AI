00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is Maya Fishler, and I'm in the home of Jean Starker Roth.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today is October 31st, 2007, and Jean and I are going to be talking about the years

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
when she was raising a family here in Corvallis, her life with Kermit, and that section of her life.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you did a great job in your interview with Wade, telling about how you met Kermit.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I don't want to make you repeat that story, but it is a wonderful story about how you two came together.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But I'd like to know a little bit more.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The questions that he didn't ask you are the kinds of questions that a woman has a tendency more to ask in terms of what it was about him that attracted you.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How you knew he was the right man for you at the very early days there.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I had been dating a lot of boys out at the, not only at Campadier, but also in Park in Astoria, at the USO, and officers clubs up there.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I don't know when I met Kermit, we just hit it off and the first date that we had after the original date at the fraternity house.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We just talked and talked and talked and everything was just, you know, we agreed on a lot of things.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He was an easy person to spend time with.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, that's right.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And so I think that that, and of course he was tall and he was good looking.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Lots of people said that he looked just like Gary Cooper.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In fact, when I obtained his picture to put in my apartment in Astoria, when I had people come they'd say, why do you have Gary Cooper's picture in you?

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wow, that's quite a statement.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And also, after we were married, sometimes we'd go to a gas station and the gas station boys would come up and then after they put the gas in several times this happened.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They would knock on my door and they'd say, did anybody ever tell you your husband looks like Gary Cooper?

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, that's quite a compliment.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you dated for about a year before you got married?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We met in September because that was State Fair and P.I., which was Pacific International.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That was a big thing with extension.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then Thanksgiving he planted his paternity pin and a Christmas we announced our engagement and we were married in June.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's a pretty quick turnaround.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So it was September that you met him.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ha, well, you must have been pretty sure then that he was the right man.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, that's right.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There was never any doubt in my mind.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, what were some of the things that you did together in that those first six months that helped to secure your relationship?

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, I think that we spent a lot of time with our families and I think that was very educational because from then on, from the time we met he would come to Astoria.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I had an apartment in a big old, what do I want to say?

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was a very old, old house and the people that I lived with had two little girls.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And I think they wanted me to live there because I could occasionally babysit if they wanted to go to a late movie they knew I was home and could watch the girls.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But we stopped.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I lost my drink.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You spent a time with your family.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, well, he would come up and they offered for him to stay in their bedroom, a bedroom adjoining my unit.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then the next weekend we'd go to his mother's house and can be with me there.

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then the next weekend we'd come down to Carvalis and he was at the fraternity and I was with my parents.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I see.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, in those days you didn't live together before you married.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Absolutely not.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But we were at one of our, one of those three places every weekend from that time on.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So your parents got to know him pretty quickly.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, yes.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How did they like him?

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They thought he was fine.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They liked him from the start, huh?

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Never, never really discussed it.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But I remember very distinctly saying, now if you have any, I'm going to marry this man.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you got any objections, tell me now.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, good.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm like you had gotten pretty bold over the years.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You've come a long way from those early days.

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So he was still going to school at that time.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because he had started school.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And do you want me to tell you a little bit about his background?

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Absolutely.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, Carvalis was raised in Monmouth because his father was superintendent of schools there.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I guess that Carvalis played Monmouth in football and he played football.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I didn't know a man.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then his father wanted to get his doctorate degree.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So Carvalis joined the 3C.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, he went to school, I think, one term.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And then his dad didn't have enough money to go and get a doctorate.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So Carvalis joined the 3C's and he sent his money home from that.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So his dad could get his doctorate.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then...

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That was right after high school?

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then his father did get his doctorate.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But it was during the war by then.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And he was asked to go to Portland to teach welders how to not only weld.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, that's wrong.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He was asked to teach welders how to teach welders.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, interesting.

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Because a lot of them knew how to weld, but they couldn't teach people how to weld.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So he was employed to do that, to teach.

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then Carvalis went in the service and his father died while he was overseas.

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So the Red Cross flew him home.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't know him at this point in life.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then his mother had always taught at school.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And she moved to Canby and bought a house.

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And it was a four or five bedroom house.

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And she took in teachers because she was so lonely.

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So that developed when we were married.

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And then she died when we had to get a house.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We had to buy a house that fit our furniture because she had all these beds and mattresses.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, did you inherit it?

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We inherited all her furniture.

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, right.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You could have started a rooming house yourself.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But the bedding and all of that was so good to give away.

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So we tried to keep it.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And of course eventually we used it with all our cans.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's a good thing.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So where was Kermit in the war?

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He was Tinian, which is a little island about a mile by a mile and a half.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Very close to...

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, I'll have to think about that.

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll have to get you the name of that.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But you'd know it if you heard it.

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It was very much in the news.

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it was a small island.

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But there were jabs on it.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And they never knew when they were going to run into somebody who was hiding in that island.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But that was when he learned to scuba dive because he was a mechanic repairing airplanes that had been shot down.

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And so he took the plexiglass and made a mask and took the rubber off the tires and it had blown.

115
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And made the back of the mask.

116
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And he made quite a little money during that period because he would dive for shells.

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I don't know how many shoe boxes of shells when we were married.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He brought those with him.

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So he took advantage of being in a tropical location?

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, he did.

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And he always blessed the government for sending him to a warm climate because he said that he never would have survived in Europe with a cold.

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He did like to be cold.

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So he was with the Air Force.

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But he didn't fly. He was always a mechanic.

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, he intended to fly.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But by the time he got through his schooling, they didn't need pilots anymore.

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And he had a course of very handy man and he knew how to fix anything.

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So they put him in a good job for him.

129
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But he did have to do some combat?

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, not really. It was never a shooting person.

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He just worked on the airplanes.

132
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But when they walked around the island, they were exposed to jacks sometimes.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I know he said that he'd dug some holes to hide in, if they were around.

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But he wasn't in a situation where he was particularly traumatized when he came back.

135
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He was in pretty good shape.

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, he was in pretty good shape.

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But he told me that when he came back and of course he'd lost his dad.

138
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And so his mother wanted a lot of things done around the house.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And he said he didn't go out at all. He just wanted to stay home.

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So he did a lot of repair work around the house that she wanted done for.

141
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think it was over six months that he just didn't do anything.

142
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, he needed to make a transition.

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes. And then when he came back to school,

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
he was ready to get on with his life.

145
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And his goal when he came back to school was to get a Tomlinson commission.

146
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And it must be a thing of the past because I asked some military men not long ago

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
if they knew what a Tomlinson commission was and they didn't know anything about it.

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But as I understood it at the time, it was a commission given to people with proper qualifications

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that would give them a permanent place in the military,

150
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
not a reserve commission which most of the kids who go through ROTC receive.

151
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So that was quite an honor to get that.

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then we were going to be married in June.

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And he received the Tomlinson commission just in very short time, maybe the middle of May.

154
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Before we were to be married and he said he never consulted me but he just said,

155
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I just figured you wouldn't make a very good military wife and I turned it down.

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's interesting. Now, why do you think he thought that was it the moving around part

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that he thought she was looking for?

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think so. And I also think that he blamed it on me a little bit.

159
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But I think that the time he decided to get married that he wanted to be settled down,

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
he didn't want to travel. So I think it was a little bit of both.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's a hard life really definitely.

162
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes, it is.

163
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So what was his major in college?

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Industrial engineering.

165
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, interesting. I didn't realize that.

166
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And he worked for a high-ster company the first year or so.

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We moved after we went on our honey.

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, I don't know whether I covered this with weight or not but we were.

169
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He was commissioned in the morning and he got the Tomlinson commission.

170
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
At noon he was graduated from Oregon State and it was 107 degrees in Corvallis.

171
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
At that time they graduated from the men's gym which is now something else I don't know.

172
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And they had ice, big 50-pound box of ice in all the windows.

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I remember looking at his car he had perspired clear through all his car.

174
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And then we were married in the evening.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh my goodness.

176
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That was a big day.

177
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It was.

178
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Had you planned it that way?

179
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Did you know the graduation was going to happen?

180
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes.

181
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, that sounds like a stressful way to do things.

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But after the honeymoon, why?

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And that was also a little crisis because we had the van port flood at that moment.

184
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Tell me what that is.

185
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And so we were going up to Lake Quenalt.

186
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We had to get up to Washington.

187
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And so Kerman said, well we were going to spend the first night in Salem because we didn't want to drive very far.

188
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And after the wedding and all the day we had.

189
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So there was a thunderstorm that night because of the heat.

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And when we drove up the highway there were power lines coming down and flopping on the highway.

191
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I thought, oh we're going to get electrocuted before we ever have a honeymoon.

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But we did.

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We made it to Salem.

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then we knew that the bridges and we're all closed.

195
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So the only way to get north was through long view or bridge of the gods.

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And so he said, which do you want to do?

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And I said, well we're off on a holiday.

198
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's just go to the bridge of the gods.

199
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I've never been across the bridge of the gods.

200
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And he said, okay.

201
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So we went up there.

202
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And we came around and we got as far as some place in Washington.

203
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't remember the name.

204
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Good river is close to the river.

205
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Kay, it was something Kay.

206
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I can look on a map and find it.

207
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But anyway we got that far.

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the town was underwater.

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So then we had to turn around and go back over the bridge of the gods down to long view and then across.

210
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wow.

211
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And we called that wet flood, the Vanport flood.

212
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Vanport flood.

213
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And that was a big major.

214
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It was where a lot of people lived during the war.

215
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It was kind of low income housing.

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And it all flooded.

217
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And you never heard of that Vanport flood?

218
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I am embarrassed to say that that happened.

219
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, it's very well known.

220
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like a lot of people.

221
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So was it a section of Portland?

222
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It was out by Jensen Beach.

224
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, look that up and read about it a little bit.

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So anyway, you were going to tell me a little bit about your wedding.

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, yes.

227
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It was at the Presbyterian church.

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's correct.

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And at first I said to my parents that I don't want to be married in the Presbyterian church

230
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
because at that time it's been remodeled since it was pretty barney.

231
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And that cold I felt.

232
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I just didn't want to be married there.

233
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, we got to looking at the wedding list.

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And of course, Kermit's family was from Monmouth.

235
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And my family had lived here forever.

236
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And the guest list was getting so big that that was about the only place that we could have the wedding.

237
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So bless my father.

238
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He decided that he could fix it.

239
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So that morning he and I don't know who else.

240
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I wasn't aware of it all going on.

241
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Somebody helped him and they brought in about 50 fertries.

242
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There were a lot of them.

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And they put it all around the front of the church.

244
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it was so hot that they...

245
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And it was in June when the new growth was on the fertries.

246
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And so they wilted and it looked like a little ornament on each limb of the trees.

247
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It was just beautiful.

248
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And so it was on the inside of the church.

249
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
They brought them all in and put them up inside the church.

251
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And as I say, all the fertries, because it was so hot, they just wilted.

252
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And all those little new growth on it, just hung down.

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And they looked like a little ornament.

254
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was just really quite effective.

255
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then we had white...

256
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
One of those white flowers that you take to cemetery in June from Memorial Day.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Not chrysanthemums, but not down.

258
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't know either, but I can look it up.

259
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll let you do that.

260
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I may be able to think of it before we get through.

261
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But anyway, it was really pretty all white and then the shades of green.

262
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It was really quite lovely and people were quite impressed by it.

263
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes, and so perfect for your family.

264
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes, it was.

265
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's a nice statement.

266
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So tell me about your dress.

267
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Is it something that...

268
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, I made my dress.

269
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So in those days, there were the bridal stores that there are now.

270
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I wanted to wear my mother's wedding dress, but it was too small.

271
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My mother was a very petite lady when she was married.

272
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But she had a lot of lace on her dress and also on the veil.

273
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So I took the lace and put some sheer yoke on my dress.

274
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And the lace was from her wedding dress.

275
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So it was quite a sentimental affair.

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I made it because I was a home economist and I sewed.

277
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And there were patterns and sewing books to use.

278
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So it worked out just fine.

279
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And then her veil had been kind of eaten through the ears with different, I suppose, balls or something.

280
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't know.

281
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And anyway, I used all the lace from her veil around the edge of my veil.

282
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So I thought that was quite nice.

283
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, it sounds very touching.

284
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Was it a large group?

285
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Was it your family or were there friends and community members too?

286
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, there weren't too many because there was my father's sister and her husband.

287
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And then my grandmother was...

288
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
My father's mother was alive at that time.

289
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And her wish was that she lived to see me married.

290
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And she got her wish.

291
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
She came in a wheelchair.

292
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And she couldn't see very well.

293
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But we had a nice conversation.

294
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And during our honeymoon she died.

295
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And so we had to come home from our honeymoon to go to her funeral.

296
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It was wonderful that she got her wish.

297
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

298
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So there's so much planning and such that goes into weddings these days.

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It seems like it's just a huge endeavor.

300
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Did you have a big build up to it?

301
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Well, no.

302
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think in those days it wasn't a three day affair like it is now.

303
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, as I say, we were pretty busy all day.

304
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But we just had the wedding and then reception.

305
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And people didn't stay long at that reception.

306
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It was too hot.

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But we had cake.

308
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I think we just had cake and punch.

309
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There at the church.

310
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, that sounds just right because then you could get out and get on your way.

311
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

312
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So now they do a breakfast after the wedding and all that stuff.

313
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Dinner beforehand.

314
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, yeah.

315
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
My daughter went to a wedding not so long ago.

316
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It was in Hawaii.

317
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They had a big groom's dinner.

318
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes, my folks did a groom's dinner the night before.

319
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And we had a lot of the fraternity boys.

320
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And some of the family, but there were only just those few people.

321
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't think my grandmother came to that because she was too frail.

322
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But we did have, and they gave it because her mother was in, she lived in Canvy.

323
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So it wasn't convenient for her to do it.

324
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And those days we didn't go to restaurants.

325
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It was all done in your home.

326
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Sure.

327
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've got more of a family event.

328
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, you know, we only had just one or two restaurants in Carvalas.

329
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Customs in and out.

330
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The Gables, that was about it.

331
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The Gables was an original.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Interesting.

333
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Have any of your, did either of your daughters use your dress as a wedding dress?

334
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No.

335
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No.

336
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They never did.

337
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They wanted their own.

338
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Do you still have that dress?

339
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes, I do.

340
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'd love to have a picture of you and your dress and this.

341
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It won't fit now.

342
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't mean a curved picture.

343
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But I do have a picture.

344
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Good.

345
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Wonderful.

346
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So you went off and did your honeymoon and then he ended up in a first job in Portland.

347
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And how did he get that job with Heister?

348
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, I think through the college in those days we had placement people.

349
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I know I was placed in a job by a placement person on the campus.

350
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I presume that's how he got his job and he worked for Heister for...

351
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We lived there.

352
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We lived in an apartment, a very small apartment for a few months.

353
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Her mother wanted to do three things before she died.

354
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I'll try to remember what they were.

355
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
She wanted to go down to see her other son, Norman, who lived in California.

356
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
She wanted to fly in an airplane.

357
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What was the third thing she wanted to do?

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, she did all three anyway, whatever they were.

359
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It may come to you too.

360
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And so she said, why don't you and Kermit live in my house while I go do these things?

361
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because she spent probably a month maybe more down in California.

362
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And she had a garden.

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
She was a great gardener.

364
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Of course, can be soil is wonderful for gardens.

365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And so we stayed at the house and took care of the garden.

366
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I did a lot of canning for her and got things made use of what was in the garden.

367
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then she came home.

368
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I had an offer.

369
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I think maybe I told Wade this.

370
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I had an offer to go down to the dowels.

371
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And do a...

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Sometimes I have trouble with getting the right words out.

373
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I was judging a fair.

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And so I said to her, wouldn't you like to go with me?

375
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That'd be a nice trip for you.

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm just going for the day.

377
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And she said, oh, she'd love to.

378
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, she went with me.

379
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I judged pillow slips among them.

380
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And broader pillow slips among many other things.

381
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And I gave first prize to the white embroidered pillow slips.

382
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because a lot of the women had done multi-colored ones.

383
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And they were pretty bad.

384
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Excuse me.

385
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Hello.

386
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes.

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes, Rebecca. How are you this morning?

388
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well, I'm fine, Rebecca.

389
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I have a lady sitting here now that's doing an interview with me.

390
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So I really can't talk.

391
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh, good. Good.

392
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, now when are you in a week from Friday?

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, would you put a little tickler on your counter to call me when you get home so that we can...

394
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I can come down and talk with you.

395
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Okay. Thanks.

396
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, we had a good time, didn't we?

397
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I did.

398
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay. Bye. Bye.

399
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Sorry.

400
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That's great.

401
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Can you give the prize to the white pillow slips?

402
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes.

403
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So anyway, there was quite some discussion, apparently, about this judge who was doing this.

404
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And she sat in the corner and listened to her new daughter-in-law, you know, being criticized.

405
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
She could hardly wait to get in the car and tell me that he's women, that's it.

406
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And she was just laughing.

407
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And she just thought that was the funniest thing.

408
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They could get that excited about their real emotions.

409
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
She had quite a sense of humor.

410
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
She used it often.

411
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
She just had a great sense of humor.

412
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We got along just great.

413
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, it's a shame that you didn't get to spend more time with her.

414
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yes.

415
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then I suppose we better put in something about how she died because it wasn't more than a couple of months.

416
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'd forgotten when she died, but she didn't last more than a couple of months after she came home.

417
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And we got a call when we were in Portland.

418
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We had moved from the house where we lived while she was away.

419
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And we got in our department in Portland.

420
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We lived where the Safeway is now in Lloyd Center.

421
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And we got a call one morning about 530 or 6.

422
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And the landlady's, you know, telephones were hard to get right after the war.

423
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And she had no telephone in her house.

424
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And we had no telephone in our house in our apartment.

425
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But the landlady called and she tapped on our door and she said,

426
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
your mother has had a heart attack and you need to go.

427
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And so we just dressed and left.

428
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And we got there, she had the heart attack and gotten up and tried to make it over to the neighbors,

429
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but had fallen in her garden.

430
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And the neighbors had found her early in the morning, fortunately.

431
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And so they got her back into the house and in bed.

432
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And of course we got there and called the doctor.

433
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And you know, what we know about heart now is just like night and day.

434
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Because we didn't know the minutes where seconds were important at that time.

435
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And the doctors at that era made house calls.

436
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So the doctor came to the house.

437
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And of course by that time, you know, she had a lot of problems.

438
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Well, she lasted about two or three days.

439
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I remember, Kermit went back to her apartment to clean out the refrigerator

440
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and get things squared away because we just left and bring some clothes for us to wear.

441
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And so when he was gone to Portland to get those things taken care of,

442
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
she had another attack.

443
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And I was feeding her some apple sauce because I had made some from her own apples.

444
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And she said, oh, it smells so good.

445
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I just would like to have a taste.

446
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And so I said, well, fine, I'll fix you some.

447
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And I was feeding her.

448
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And all of a sudden she just died.

449
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And so Kermit came home about the time that that happened.

450
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And he immediately called the doctor.

451
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And he said, well, she's gone.

452
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So sorry.

453
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Hello.

454
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Hi there.

455
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
How are you?

456
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Good.

457
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But I'm with a lady here that I need to...

458
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
She's doing an interview with me and I don't have much time to talk, unfortunately.

459
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Where are you now?

460
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay.

461
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, I'll call you tonight.

462
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I mailed the package to Micah today about the coat.

463
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, so he'll get it in a couple of days.

464
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Good.

465
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Well, I said I took all the things off of the batches and then I sent it to the cleaners.

466
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So it's all ready to go.

467
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
All right.

468
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, I'll try and call you around five o'clock work.

469
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

470
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll give you a call.

471
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay.

472
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That was my grandson.

474
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Quite all right.

475
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So you were saying that Kermit got there just as she asked away.

476
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yes.

477
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And I didn't know anything about death and he held her tongue down.

478
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It was pretty awful.

479
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And we had to call his brother in California and they came up and then we divided all the stuff.

480
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And that's how we got all the furniture because they didn't want the furniture.

481
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They'd been married for a number of years.

482
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And he was the oldest brother and Kermit was the youngest.

483
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
They said, you just take all the furniture, so that's what we did.

484
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So do you think you said she had some a few wishes of things she wanted to do before she died?

485
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Do you think she had a sense that she was?

486
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I think she knew that and I really think that Kermit sensed that he was not going to live very long.

487
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Really?

488
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because he was so always so insistent that I know everything about our business.

489
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And so and both his parents had died of heart attack.

490
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
His father fell off of, he was milking a cow and fell off the stool and died.

491
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So, you know, he had bad genes.

492
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah.

493
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's true.

494
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That means a lot.

495
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But she was a delightful person while you knew her and did Kermit have that same fun sense of humor as she had?

496
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't think it was quite as broad as her sense of humor, but she got a big kick out of life.

497
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So it was nice to know her briefly.

498
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So there you were in the big city of Portland.

499
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Was it a pretty happening town at the time?

500
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, yes. I think that I really enjoyed Portland.

501
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I didn't want to move back to Kermit Palace when we finally made that decision.

502
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But Kermit thought it was the thing to do.

503
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We had two children by then and he thought it was the thing to do.

504
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And my dad was putting a lot of pressure on him to come back and start a plywood plant.

505
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh, interesting.

506
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And of course Kermit had the industrial engineering training.

507
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So there were ten men who put their money together and built the plywood plant.

508
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And Kermit designed it and was in charge of it because the rest of the men all had other jobs.

509
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So he did that for three or four years.

510
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Don't remember just how long.

511
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But then the plywood market went kaput.

512
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And so they sold it to somebody, can't remember.

513
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So then he Kermit went into partnership with a man, Gordon Larson.

514
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And that's, you know, Beverly Larson, who runs the O'Mail School.

515
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, it was her father that was in partnership with Kermit.

516
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And my dad was sort of putting up the money for this mill.

517
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Gordon had had a mill out, well, at the Y in Pholomath, he was on the wall port side.

518
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't know.

519
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It wasn't very far up that road.

520
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He had always had a saw mill.

521
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And so, but they decided they built it down here at 53rd and reservoir road.

522
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And so Kermit designed that mill.

523
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And then they built it and ran it for, I would say maybe eight or nine years.

524
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And then they had a, I wouldn't say a, well, they disagreed on just a little bit about how it should be run.

525
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And so Kermit said he'd like to buy him out.

526
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Gordon didn't have the money to buy him out.

527
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So Kermit did buy the mill out.

528
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And then Gordon died probably maybe six months after that.

529
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That was all settled.

530
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because, of course, they had to divide up all the timberland and everything.

531
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, I see.

532
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They had properties that went with the mill.

533
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
They bought a lot of timberland in order to have timber in the winter time when they couldn't log other places.

534
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They bought timberland that could be logged in the winter time.

535
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So, that was very fortunate that we got all that done before he died.

536
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes, that would have been nice.

537
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
He died of hard attack, too, as I remember it.

538
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You could check with them about that, but I think that he did.

539
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So that mill's not there anymore, is it?

540
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, it is.

541
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's where they started to run sheep.

542
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, I know there's just a little organic meat there.

543
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
They couldn't do it because it was annexed.

544
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, when I ran the property for a number of years after my husband died,

545
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I rented it out to various people who ran the mill.

546
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And then timber prices weren't very good.

547
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And the last people that owned it, it was just ready to not be run anymore.

548
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And so, one day, they were putting in the water pipe down reservoir road,

549
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and then it came into the fairgrounds, and they wanted some place to dump the dirt.

550
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And so, I said, well, dump it in the pond because I just assumed fill in those ponds.

551
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Well, it seemed as though that was not the thing to do because there are rules about filling ponds I found out.

552
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Well, one day, I spent, I don't know how long on the telephone.

553
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It was all one afternoon and into the next day, talking to governmental agencies.

554
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And finally, I got a hold of some, I don't remember which one.

555
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But they said, oh, Mrs. Roth, we don't talk to owners, we just talk to lawyers.

556
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And that was the living end. I just decided I wasn't going to have anything to do with that.

557
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So, my, I was moping to my son about it.

558
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And he said, oh, mom, you shouldn't have that stress.

559
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I said, I'll take over running it.

560
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So anyway, he tried to run it for, I don't know, four or five years.

561
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And he was in California, and it was just too much.

562
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So he finally sold it.

563
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And that's when they started to run the goats.

564
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And then they found out they couldn't run the goats because it was in it.

565
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
He had annexed it.

566
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So now it's in city, within city limits.

567
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah, yeah, it's in the city limits.

568
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That's interesting.

569
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And it's very odd because soon after, can got through, sold it.

570
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And now, they're, you know, they put in all that lovely area in front of the fairgrounds

571
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and they've got the dirt over ready.

572
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And they're going to run the street 50th, it's going to go up over the rail road.

573
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And they're going to do that right away.

574
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

575
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's interesting.

576
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So bad at the city.

577
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You know, one thing after another.

578
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So he, so current was, as long as we're talking about his career,

579
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I can ask you the rest of my questions about, about his career.

580
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So he then stayed at that mill till, I know this.

581
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He wanted himself in 67 then.

582
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And then did he stay with the mill?

583
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
All the rest of his life?

584
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes.

585
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yes, he shut it down after he'd run it 12 years.

586
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And we didn't do anything with it.

587
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I guess he, I can't remember whether he rented it to anybody or not.

588
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But he played the stock market and he was very sharp about it.

589
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
He would get up in the morning and look at all the listings in the paper.

590
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And he made a lot of money on the stock market because he just had a feel for it.

591
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And one time we bought Fuji Photo Stock.

592
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And we made a lot of money on that because it was just when it was starting to come into the United States.

593
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So he said, I think we should take a trip.

594
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I said, well, we made our money on Fuji Photo.

595
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I think we should go to Japan.

596
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And so we did.

597
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And that was real fun.

598
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We had a lovely, lovely trip.

599
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So was that when you had all four children?

600
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Did you take children with you on the trip?

601
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yes.

602
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You did.

603
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Wow.

604
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, I guess we can skip to that.

605
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I want to get back to a couple more questions about his progression through his career too.

606
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But I'd love to hear about the Japan trip since we're there.

607
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
We got a lady to stay with, in the meantime, my mother had passed away.

608
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And we got a lady to stay with the children.

609
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But she had to also feed my father because after my mother died,

610
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
the course that day, I said, will stay for dinner.

611
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And he just kept coming.

612
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
He kept coming.

613
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That lasted 15 years.

614
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
He had a regular dinner invitation.

615
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yes.

616
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Well, he didn't have an invitation, but he came.

617
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He had a seat at the table.

618
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Uh-huh.

619
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And at first, he lived just through the woods

620
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
between Jackson and Van Buren.

621
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But then later, he moved out on Tittian edition out on 53rd Street.

622
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And then by that time, Kim was learning to drive.

623
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And so she'd go out and get him and bring him in because he wasn't driving by that time.

624
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So he just always came.

625
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's a nice thing.

626
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's good.

627
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So you had a woman who stayed in the house.

628
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And she had to feed him too.

629
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So care of things there.

630
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And then the rest of you packed off to Asia.

631
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yes, we did.

632
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And then a very extravagant trip at that time.

633
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Oh, it was.

634
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, we've stopped over in Fiji going.

635
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And then we had a couple of days there.

636
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And then we went to Japan.

637
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And then on the way back, we stopped at Porobora.

638
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Wow.

639
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
How long was the trip all together?

640
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I think we were gone three weeks.

641
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That was a pretty long trip.

642
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yes.

643
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And that was your first time out of the country, right?

644
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, we've been to Hawaii a couple of times.

645
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So you've done some flying.

646
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes, because we took all the family to Hawaii a couple of times.

647
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So was it more of a traveler since he'd done his stint there?

648
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He really enjoyed the trip to Japan.

649
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
He just thought he didn't have any desire to go to Europe at all.

650
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I think he'd heard too many tales during the war of hardships in Europe with the military.

651
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But he really, I don't know why,

652
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
but he just thought that Japan was great.

653
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Interesting.

654
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So having been in the Second World War and over in that part of the World War,

655
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
was it hard for him to embrace the Japanese?

656
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Did he feel any prejudice against them?

657
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It seemed to be, he didn't seem to have any feelings about the Japanese.

658
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
We were there during what do they call that?

659
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
When you have the world, it was...

660
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Not the world's fair.

661
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
World's fair.

662
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's what it was.

663
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And of course, we were so tall that the Japanese,

664
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
we'd hold our hands out like this in the Japanese,

665
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
but get under our arms and then they want their pictures taken.

666
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Because we were so tall.

667
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

668
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
What an experience for your children to be able to see that?

669
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Well, we've showed them the pictures, of course, when we got home, but they didn't go home.

670
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So the children didn't go home?

671
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
No, no, no, it was just us.

672
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
No, the babysitter stayed and took care of them.

673
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
We didn't take care of everybody.

674
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I see.

675
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They didn't go home.

676
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But then all together.

677
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah.

678
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Well, I want to ask you some more about some of the other travels, too,

679
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
but so we don't get too off course here.

680
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm going to take us back to where we were when you were talking.

681
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I just wanted to finish up learning a little bit about Kermit's career

682
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
because you've been talking about that.

683
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And what I wondered was when it was that he started getting involved in property management.

684
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
How we move from being an industrial engineer to the lumber business

685
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
into that's quite a transition there.

686
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes, it was.

687
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Well, I told you that my mother had died there.

688
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And I had inherited the by-mart property through my mother's part when she died.

689
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And so my dad had given me that property in exchange for some property that he had.

690
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And that's a 10-21 real estate exchange.

691
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And that's how that came about.

692
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And that's probably he's more known for that in the United States than for his forestry.

693
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Are you familiar with that?

694
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Well, when I first started looking researching your family a little bit before I started,

695
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and I did find that that many references on the internet to TJ Starker

696
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
have to do with that real estate judgment.

697
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yes.

698
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And that was decided and then has been sort of the standard then from then on.

699
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes.

700
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And so we inherited that.

701
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And then we bought several when he was working with the stock market.

702
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We bought several pieces of property and in turn did some 10-31 exchanges with that.

703
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And we always traded up.

704
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And so we just, you know, that was our income was because we didn't have anything.

705
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
We had to have some flow.

706
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But when Kermit died, there was not much property that was giving me any real secure monthly money flow.

707
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And so that's when I started doing the real estate thing.

708
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Because I traded some of the timber land that was left over from the mill.

709
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I traded that for real estate.

710
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And that I would really like to have some emphasis put on that because when my father died, he left me having.

711
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
In fact, in his well, it says to my daughter, Gene, I leave nothing.

712
00:52:48,000 --> 00:53:02,000
His whole point in establishing his timber was to create a Starker forest.

713
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What would you say?

714
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Like a theater.

715
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yes.

716
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And he didn't want it broken up.

717
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So he didn't.

718
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And everybody thinks I got some money from him and that's how I got started, but that's not the way it was.

719
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
He wanted all that to be kept within the structure of the business.

720
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That's right.

721
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Interesting.

722
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And you know, I could be bitter, but I don't know what I did with that piece of paper.

723
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I have two things that I think I'd like to put in this because that's what I lived by.

724
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I wrote that out.

725
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Well, all look when I go out to the kitchen before you leave and see, because I wrote those sayings down.

726
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:20,000
One is something about it's worded better than I can worded, but it's something about if you have an acid in a container, it sometimes eats it the container that it's in.

727
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And then there's another one out there.

728
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And I think that's very true.

729
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I could be really bitter.

730
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yes.

731
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And I could be very upset with my nephews.

732
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
They had nothing to do with it.

733
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It was all my dad's object to leave that as a unit.

734
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And he didn't want.

735
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And he didn't really appreciate women either.

736
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
He didn't like the fact that women were in the forestry school.

737
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And he didn't really like my sister-in-law got interested in the timber business.

738
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And he really didn't like that either.

739
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
He was of German.

740
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah.

741
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Traditional.

742
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The oldest son.

743
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yeah.

744
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah, that's, like you say, that's a longstanding tradition of patriarchy.

745
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah, that's right.

746
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Well, you did very well.

747
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yes, probably by German's hard work in the stock market and buying things at the right time and that kind of thing.

748
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And does the Roth property services business still exist?

749
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh, yes.

750
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That's what I do.

751
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I do three times a week.

752
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I work at that.

753
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I have a bookkeeper that comes and keeps track of things.

754
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And I manage the properties.

755
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And I have four major properties that I'm leaving to.

756
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
One to each one of my children.

757
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So how did you learn how to do all that real estate business?

758
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't know.

759
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I think it was by Osmosis from learning from hearing my dad speak about it.

760
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I think I just absorbed the way it was supposed to be done.

761
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Because of course, his talk at the dinner table was always about business.

762
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah.

763
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And I think I must have just sort of absorbed it.

764
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Did you increment work together in the early years when you were finished?

765
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Absolutely.

766
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, absolutely.

767
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We did.

768
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I remember one time we owned up that property down.

769
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's a corner of, it's where that painting pottery painting places.

770
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Down town.

771
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And we owned that building at one time.

772
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And the real estate man, I remember this so vividly, he called up and he said,

773
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
did we want to sell it?

774
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And Kermit put down the phone and he said, do we want to sell that?

775
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Because there was a lot of agitation at the time that they were going to change downtown.

776
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And the Madison Avenue Task Force was in starting and they were going to do big things.

777
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And of course, the guy that's chairman of the Madison Avenue Task Force is a very good friends of ours and still friends.

778
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But I didn't always agree with what they were doing.

779
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And so I said to Kermit, you know, I think we're going to be charged a lot for doing makeover there.

780
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And I said, what do they want to give us for it?

781
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And so the realtor said, well, what do you take for it?

782
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And we don't only held it a year or so.

783
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And I said, well, 50,000 more than we want to pay for it.

784
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And he said that my buyers will take it.

785
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But 10 minute conversation.

786
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I thought that that was a pretty good way to make 50,000 bucks.

787
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, so the two of you were sort of a business team.

788
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes, we'd always kind of saw eye to eye on how we did it.

789
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So forth, we never had any discussions.

790
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We just talk about it.

791
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
That was it.

792
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Go on from there.

793
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So did he ever regret leaving me off being an industrial engineer?

794
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
No, I don't think so.

795
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
No, I think it was very much.

796
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I think he really enjoyed the business aspect of it.

797
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
He thinks so.

798
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Sounds like he was a natural at that.

799
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yes.

800
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

801
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So you had your first two children there in Portland?

802
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yes.

803
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And then we moved down here.

804
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And we had a house down on 10th and Adams.

805
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Right by the railroad.

806
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Pacific through.

807
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You remember that?

808
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah, about word.

809
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Yeah, where it was right there.

810
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And we bought the house because it had enough bedrooms for us to put the furniture.

811
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And then my dad was developing Cedarhurst which is the corner of 35th and Harrison.

812
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And he had, I think it's 32 acres in there.

813
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And he developed that with a division of Ben Buren and Jackson.

814
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And he gave us a hunk of property down on Jackson Street because he'd given my brother a piece of that area between Ben Buren and Jackson.

815
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But clear at the end of where the dairy barns were.

816
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And of course they lived at the last house out on Harrison.

817
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
They built that when I was in high school.

818
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So that's where we lived.

819
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So after we moved back to Curvellis while he gave Curvell and I this piece at the end of Jackson.

820
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And Curvellis just took a year off and built that house.

821
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And he built it with the help of one carpenter.

822
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And I think he only subcontracted.

823
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:23,000
He did the wiring so he subcontracted the heating and the water.

824
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Seems to me there was something else.

825
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
He did all the rest of it himself because he was capable of doing that.

826
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And I back primed all that siding.

827
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I would go out there after the children got up from their naps in the afternoon.

828
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I'd go out and they'd play in the yard.

829
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, I was painting.

830
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So we did it together but it mostly curmed.

831
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
That's impressive.

832
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Is that house still standing?

833
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yes, the Kines lived there.

834
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yes, in fact it was written up in the paper recently.

835
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yes, I remember seeing your name in that article.

836
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And how long did you live in that house then?

837
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
We lived there 35 years.

838
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So all the way through your childhood.

839
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yes, and he died from that house and I lived there six years after he died.

840
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But you know, it was a seven bedroom house and it was a little big for one lady.

841
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And so when my last one married, I knew she wanted to be married from that house.

842
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
She's a very sentimental girl.

843
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And so as soon as she was married, then I thought, boy, it's time to take care of Jean.

844
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And so I then built this house.

845
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I see.

846
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I built this house.

847
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But Kathy in the meantime had gotten an architectural degree.

848
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And so she designed the house pretty much for me and then built her build it.

849
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Wow, wonderful.

850
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So I really supervised all the building of this house.

851
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you like building?

852
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yes, I do.

853
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And then later, I built the house at Newport.

854
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So I built two houses.

855
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
That's impressive.

856
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I helped my husband and I built our house.

857
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And I always think I would never do that again.

858
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
But some people really enjoy it.

859
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh, I did.

860
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I just thoroughly enjoyed it.

861
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah.

862
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So many decisions to make.

863
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh, yeah.

864
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But I loved it.

865
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I thought it was great.

866
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Cool, wonderful.

867
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Good.

868
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So I'm trying to envision your life here in Corvallis with four children all pretty close to the same ages.

869
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Well, they were actually ten years apart because the first three were two years apart.

870
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Then we waited four years and then had the next one.

871
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But still you had your hands full.

872
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yes, yes, I did.

873
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I was busy with the children.

874
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Did you start working before you had children?

875
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yes, I did.

876
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But I did a lot of not only volunteering, but I did some teaching at the high school with what do they call that?

877
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Well, it's where you teach certain courses to adults.

878
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I don't know what they call that now.

879
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It used to be night school.

880
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Yeah.

881
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Something like that.

882
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
But now it does have another name.

883
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You're right.

884
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah, and I don't know what that is.

885
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But I taught Pendleton Jackets were very popular.

886
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And so I taught a class on Pendleton Jackets.

887
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And sewing them.

888
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Uh-huh.

889
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, Pendleton Jacket had a lot of the principles of sewing.

890
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You know, the pockets and the...

891
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
But it wasn't really complicated.

892
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Really?

893
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But it had a lot of principles of sewing.

894
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And so I found that very much fun to teach people the basics.

895
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So what kind of things did your family do?

896
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Were you able to do some things as a group with all six of you?

897
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Or was that really too many kids to take little trips with and things like that?

898
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Oh, no.

899
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
We used to take the kids fishing every Sunday out at Quartz Creek.

900
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:57,000
And then Bruce and Betty had a pond out...

901
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Well, it was out towards...

902
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Or was that out?

903
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
We went out to the Y and turned towards Wallport.

904
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And what would we call that?

905
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I don't know.

906
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
We had 34.

907
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah.

908
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And then they had some timberland out there that they had a pond on.

909
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And there was a group of us that were quite...

910
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It was the Jim Hallons, the RT Rises,

911
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:45,000
the Budcrolls, and I guess that was at Bruce and Betty and us.

912
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And we all worked together usually on Memorial Day 4th of July.

913
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
What's the other holiday?

914
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Labor Day.

915
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Labor Day.

916
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Yeah.

917
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Having a picnic out there.

918
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
We usually went out to the pond.

919
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And then Kermit and I always took the kids and we went to...

920
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
We owned some property out...

921
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Big elk.

922
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And we went out there, crawdading.

923
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Oh.

924
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I got a great picture for you to put in the book on the crawdade.

925
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, that sounds like fun.

926
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And then we would ask somebody to come and eat crawdads.

927
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We had crawdad feeds.

928
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Big pile of crawdads, huh?

929
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Uh-huh.

930
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Yeah, that's good.

931
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And then we...

932
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
As I say, we took the kids fishing up Quartz Creek.

933
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And then finally we got a boat.

934
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And by then the Rises had a place at Triangle Lake.

935
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And we would go down there sometimes with our boat.

936
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And the kids water-skied.

937
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Oh, that's fun.

938
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
That was when they were older maybe.

939
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes.

940
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So Kermit enjoyed his family life, it sounds like.

941
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh yeah, he was a family man.

942
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I'll tell you.

943
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:14,000
When he had the mill, he would sometimes go and get equipment from other mills

944
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
that were maybe no longer in service.

945
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And he would say when he left, well,

946
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I may not be back tonight because we might have trouble loading

947
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
or, you know, doing all this.

948
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Almost always.

949
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
He'd be home by midnight.

950
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Uh-huh.

951
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
He'd never stayed over at any place.

952
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
He just wanted to be there in the family.

953
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah, he wanted to be home with the family.

954
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I never had any concerns about him full of them.

955
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That's a good thing.

956
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
No, he was definitely a family man.

957
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah.

958
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
How about summer vacations?

959
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Did you guys ever take any trips?

960
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Not really as summer vacations.

961
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But we, of course, had the place up the McKinsey,

962
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
which was really nice because he had been in the three seas up there,

963
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
which I told you about.

964
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And so we had that in common, too,

965
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
because I taught school up there.

966
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And so when we came to having a second home

967
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
or the second, whatever, it wasn't really a home,

968
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
it was a mobile home.

969
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
What do you call those?

970
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Not a mobile home.

971
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Yeah, I guess a mobile home.

972
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Like a trailer.

973
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, it was a trailer like a place.

974
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And so when we bought the property to put the trailer on,

975
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
it was up the McKinsey because we'd been up there a lot.

976
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Because we liked that area.

977
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So he had done trail building when he was there in the CCC?

978
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yes.

979
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Interesting.

980
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So that made for a good weekend getaway, probably?

981
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Yes, it was.

982
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It was a great place and the kids loved it.

983
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
They loved to fish and we had three great fishing holes on that property.

984
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And we liked it so well that after we'd had the mobile home for a while,

985
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
it was a single wide and we decided that we liked it well enough

986
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
and we wanted a fireplace because then it was cozy and we could use it in the wintertime.

987
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So we had him haul away that one and bring up a double wide.

988
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And I had that for a number of years after Kermit died.

989
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:47,000
But all of a sudden there was a crack house moved in next door

990
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and the people who owned that were from California and they rented it out.

991
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And they brought up a lot of antiques and put in it.

992
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And it was just a gorgeous place.

993
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:07,000
They rented it out and it was a crack house and the people who had it needed wood

994
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
for their fireplace and they burned up all the antiques.

995
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I thought they'll probably be over here next.

996
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And I thought this is no place for me so I sold it.

997
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And it just killed me to sell it.

998
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,000
But it was 40 miles from any fire or police help.

999
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Sure.

1000
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
There was no place for a single woman.

1001
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah, that's understandable.

1002
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So I had to give it up and I still hate it that we had to give that up.

1003
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah.

1004
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well, it sounds like you had lots of good years from it.

1005
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
No.

1006
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
That's a fun out there.

1007
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
You just have good memories.

1008
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

1009
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's a good thing too.

1010
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So you mentioned having your holidays with Bruce and Betty and I realized

1011
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I've never asked you what the transition was from when Bruce was sort of a nerdy kid who sat

1012
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and read the encyclopedia all the time.

1013
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
When did you start to get close to him?

1014
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Well, I think that Betty had a lot to do with that because she met Bruce because I had invited her

1015
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
to a summer party when we were in high school when she was going to college here.

1016
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Her father was an ROTC professor.

1017
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
He was a military man.

1018
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And so Bruce offered to take her home after the summer.

1019
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And so they were soon married and then we did a lot of things together.

1020
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We used to camp up at Spirit Lake where we had spent our Bruce and I had spent our childhood.

1021
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And so we did a lot of things together and then after Bruce died, Betty and I traveled a lot together.

1022
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
She brought the two of you closer together.

1023
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I think so.

1024
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
She brought him out of it.

1025
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
He became a lot more after he was in the military.

1026
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I think he became a lot more social.

1027
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah, that's right because you had told me that you saw each other a lot in San Francisco too.

1028
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yes.

1029
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
That's right.

1030
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Yeah.

1031
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, I'd love to hear a little bit about your children.

1032
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Okay.

1033
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Now we're early.

1034
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Well, I guess we should start early.

1035
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Okay.

1036
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Well, Ken is the oldest and he was born in Portland and he was a good baby.

1037
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
He was a real...

1038
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
We had him.

1039
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I don't know.

1040
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Did we tell you?

1041
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Did we talk about the house that we had in Portland?

1042
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Not in great detail now.

1043
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Well, I told you that the first house was this apartment in the safe way where the safe way is now in the Lloyd Center.

1044
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Well, then we moved over to the house that Ken was born from.

1045
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It was the Westminster Presbyterian Church Mance.

1046
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And it was a four-story house.

1047
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It had a basement, a main floor, a four-bedroom, a second floor, and a floor attic.

1048
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And so we called it the Roth Hotel because everybody came to see the...

1049
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
that came to Portland, stayed with us.

1050
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh, your friends.

1051
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Well, Ken was born from there and then Craig came along.

1052
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And that was when we...

1053
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Craig was about six months old when we moved to Corvallis.

1054
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And the house that we had there was all these floors.

1055
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And it had six plugins.

1056
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Three of them, I think, were in the kitchen or maybe four.

1057
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I would gas slides.

1058
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
A sink that was way down here.

1059
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And I was pregnant with Craig.

1060
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And so Kermit took out the kitchen and put in what they called a Youngstown sink.

1061
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And it was a sink with train boards, all one piece.

1062
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And so he put it up so I could do dishes.

1063
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And then we had Craig.

1064
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And the thing that I remember about Ken when he was a little kid,

1065
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
he had a rabbit that he loved and stuffed rabbit with stuffed.

1066
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And we had a backyard that we'd fenced.

1067
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And so one day he was missing.

1068
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:22,000
The lady who had been helping me with Craig had left the gate open.

1069
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Well, I was just beside myself.

1070
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So we lived at Wider, I think it was.

1071
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Anyway, it was two blocks down to Broadway.

1072
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And here he was walking along with it holding the ears of the rabbit.

1073
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Just wandering around having a good time.

1074
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I was just friends.

1075
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
He was a very adventuresome child.

1076
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Then Craig came along and he was born with no bicep or no tricep and he's left arm.

1077
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
They think I had interunion and polio.

1078
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:12,000
That was when polio was so just becoming something that was everybody had to have a shot.

1079
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So Craig was never athletic.

1080
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Ken was always very athletic.

1081
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But Craig was when he'd ride a tricycle, he could do a tricycle pretty well.

1082
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But it came to bicycles.

1083
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
He couldn't balance because he couldn't get that arm up.

1084
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
So when he was in, we moved to Carvaleson.

1085
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I would say maybe six weeks or so into kindergarten.

1086
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,000
The doctor that we had here in Carvales said I want you to go down to San Francisco

1087
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and go to Stanford Medical School and see what they can do for him.

1088
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Because he'd come in and he's a little facing, falling off his bicycle.

1089
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
His face was all scarred up.

1090
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
He just didn't have any balance.

1091
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So we took him down there.

1092
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And the story that I love to tell about Craig is that my folks took us down to go.

1093
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
We were going to fly down the San Francisco and it was fogged in.

1094
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So we had to go on down and go by rail.

1095
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, Carmen and I were just beside ourselves.

1096
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:44,000
This was a very nerve wracking experience for both of us to be taking this child down to the hospital.

1097
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
We didn't know what was going to be the results of this.

1098
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So because my father was a T-totler, we didn't ever drink at home.

1099
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
We always called it juice.

1100
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And so we went in to have some juice in the railroad car.

1101
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And we got a coke for Craig.

1102
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And the bartender there put a cherry in it.

1103
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And so when he came, he had the operation and came out of the anesthesia

1104
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and his legs and his arms were just thrashing.

1105
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And he yelled out, just in a loud voice, I want a cherry in my.

1106
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
We were never able to tell my parents.

1107
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But I think that's such a funny story.

1108
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
The little things that were just in his subconscious at that time.

1109
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So anyway, we got through that.

1110
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And then Kathy was born.

1111
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And we just expected another boy.

1112
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
We were just thrilled to have this daughter.

1113
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And then Kim was born four years later.

1114
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And the girls were really quite good seamstresses.

1115
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And I suppose that I taught them a lot of those things.

1116
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And they earned, they were blue ribbon winners for H,

1117
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
for their dresses that they made.

1118
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And I think it was Kathy went on to state fair, got a blue ribbon.

1119
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
They were really good seamstresses.

1120
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
They don't do much.

1121
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I think Kathy does more than Kim.

1122
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But they were very active in 4-H.

1123
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So were you still involved in 4-H?

1124
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yes.

1125
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And later when I was on the 4-H,

1126
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I was a trustee for the 4-H, Steve board that they had.

1127
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And my dad was very instrumental in obtaining the property for 4-H,

1128
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
the 4-H camp that's over near Salem.

1129
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Right.

1130
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And I was very active in that for a long time.

1131
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Were you a 4-H leader as well when the children were younger?

1132
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yes.

1133
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And I think I told you that Irma Seymour was my 4-H leader.

1134
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I think we talked about that.

1135
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So I've always been active in 4-H and still am to a certain extent.

1136
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
We support the swimming pool at the camp.

1137
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I read that.

1138
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So interesting.

1139
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Were the boys in 4-H as well?

1140
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
No, they were both eagle scouts.

1141
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Oh.

1142
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:17,000
In fact, that conversation was about that because my great grandson is now in scouting.

1143
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Wow.

1144
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And so I took all the scouts, always were red flannel jackets.

1145
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And I happened to remember that in the cupboard out there,

1146
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I had craigs of scouting from his scouting.

1147
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And so I gave it to my great-grandchild.

1148
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And I took all the things off of it and hung it to the cleaners.

1149
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Oh no.

1150
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's going down there.

1151
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That's fun.

1152
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Yeah.

1153
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That's funny.

1154
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Huh.

1155
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I think I read somewhere that Kermit was involved too with the boys scouting.

1156
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Yes.

1157
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:02,000
He was with the, what, I don't know what they call that.

1158
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
The headquarters are in Eugene for this area.

1159
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Uh-huh.

1160
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And he was active in that management of that.

1161
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
At the regional level.

1162
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I don't know what they call them trustees or what they call them.

1163
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But anyway, he was active in that for quite a while.

1164
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That was wonderful.

1165
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Huh.

1166
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So as a home economist, you think that you were more prepared than other women going into this whole

1167
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
child-bearing thing to be able to...

1168
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I suppose so.

1169
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
You know, because we learned a lot of child education and what we were supposed to do

1170
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and how we were supposed to handle problems and that sort of thing.

1171
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I think probably...

1172
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Did you continue to do the kind of things that you had been teaching other women to do

1173
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
with in terms of preserving food and...

1174
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Well, I've always worked with the extension service to a certain extent, you know,

1175
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
even as a volunteer.

1176
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And I think that I did.

1177
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I followed through on a lot of that.

1178
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Yeah.

1179
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Great.

1180
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
What do you think was your strength as a mother?

1181
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Do you think there was something that you were in the family that everybody depended on you for?

1182
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Cooking, I think.

1183
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Having a good meal.

1184
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Well, and I think that we cooked healthy meals because I had learned that.

1185
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You know, we always had meat and probably potatoes of some sort or rice or starch of some sort.

1186
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And vegetables and salad.

1187
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:53,000
My husband always wanted to salad because when he was in the service he didn't have any greens at all.

1188
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And I think we mentioned that he wanted lettuce when his brother came to visit.

1189
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And he always wanted greens.

1190
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So we always had balanced meals and we always sat down to eat together.

1191
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And of course later my dad ate with us that's something that I would not do again because I don't think it was fair to my children.

1192
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
When you sit down to eat your evening meal the kids want to talk about their days.

1193
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And my dad wanted to sort of, he was the conversationist and he wanted to tell us about his day.

1194
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And I don't think it was fair to my children to do that.

1195
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
But, you know, you did what you had to do at the time.

1196
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
They accommodated.

1197
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But it's true, it's not all that common out.

1198
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I have a regular meal that in itself is that.

1199
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But as a result, Kermit came home every day for lunch from the meal because he was just a short distance.

1200
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And that was our quiet time together.

1201
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The two of you.

1202
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Because we hear and often, well, sometimes not quite often, he would bring salesman home for lunch.

1203
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Because the thing to do was for the salesman to take him out, you know, try to win his favor.

1204
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah.

1205
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And he'd say, oh no, let's go home.

1206
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You know, cook or something.

1207
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And so, I think that that was our time together.

1208
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And it was also, I always had something in the pantry like a can of chicken or I could do a zillion things with chicken.

1209
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You know, it was chicken salad, chicken soup, chicken dumplings.

1210
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
You know, there were lots of things I could do on the spur of the moment to...

1211
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And sometimes he'd just call 1130 and say, can I bring someone so home?

1212
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And I'd say, oh sure, you know.

1213
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And when you say can of chicken, was that something that you had canned?

1214
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
No, no, it wasn't.

1215
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
No, I didn't want anything to do with those chickens.

1216
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I wanted them prepared.

1217
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Well, that's one of the luxuries we have now.

1218
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So, tell me if you're getting tired, are you still doing all right?

1219
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
No, I'm doing fine, but I suppose we ought to quit around three.

1220
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,000
All right, I'll move through this.

1221
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I'm almost in the same age range as your children, so I'm thinking about the era when you were raising kids and thinking about how it was such an era of change

1222
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and more permissiveness and that sort of thing from...

1223
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Yes, certainly from the era when you had been raised.

1224
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And you had been raised in such a strict way anyway.

1225
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yes.

1226
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Was that a tough transition for you to make to figure out how to set rules and discipline for your kids?

1227
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Well, I think that there was a lot of discipline.

1228
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You don't do this because your grandfather was this way.

1229
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And the other thing that I remember visibly, and I don't remember whether I told way this or not, but one day the teacher called me up when Kim was in school,

1230
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and she said, we're talking about letting the girls wear pants to school.

1231
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And what did I think about it?

1232
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And I said, it makes a lot of sense to me.

1233
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
They turned their little bottoms upside down on all the playgrounds.

1234
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Well, you know, on the playground thing, I said, it makes a lot of sense to me.

1235
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And so that's when children, because otherwise I see pictures of my kids in their grade school era,

1236
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
and they always had dresses on.

1237
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Sure.

1238
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And then all of a sudden the pants became popular.

1239
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Uh-huh.

1240
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Yeah, I can remember when we used to have to change out of our school clothes into our play clothes.

1241
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yes, that's right.

1242
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Uh-huh.

1243
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And those play clothes usually were pants.

1244
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah, that did change at a certain point.

1245
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Uh-huh.

1246
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
But you got through those teenage years without doing that too much.

1247
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
No, my girls didn't date.

1248
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Uh-huh.

1249
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Ken dated in college, but I don't remember that.

1250
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Well, he did date when he was a senior.

1251
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But I don't remember that we had to any concerns about that.

1252
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Good.

1253
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
They were pretty, you know, they had learned.

1254
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I used to tell him, don't misbehave because somebody knows you and somebody is going to towel on you.

1255
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I say the same thing.

1256
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It's the beauty of living in a small town.

1257
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Were there particular stages of childhood that you enjoyed more than others?

1258
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Like, did you love that stage when they were just little?

1259
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Yes, I did.

1260
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And I think that I probably enjoyed the girls when they were all maybe six to twelve or something like that.

1261
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I really liked that age.

1262
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
They were old enough to be talk to and sensible.

1263
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:42,000
You know, you could kind of guide them through that period.

1264
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I really enjoyed that part of it, I think.

1265
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
How about the boys?

1266
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
The boys were always so active in scouting.

1267
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I think Kermit did a lot of the parenting at that age with the boys because he would take in camping with the scouts.

1268
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:17,000
And he would arrange to have them go and meet with other people to get their badges.

1269
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I think he did a lot of the parenting with the boys.

1270
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
It's interesting.

1271
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,000
He'd take them to the mill and lots of times he'd come home if he had to go to Eugene or Portland for a part or something.

1272
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
He would come by and grab one of the boys and take them.

1273
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And that was very helpful to me because that gave me a little freedom.

1274
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And I remember one time he was coming back from Eugene and he and Craig were singing.

1275
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And he wasn't watching this pedometer and he got stuck.

1276
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And so the cop said something about what were they doing?

1277
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And Craig piped up and says, oh Danny and I were singing!

1278
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:12,000
And the cop said, you know, if more dads would do that, we'd be a lot better off.

1279
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
You can go.

1280
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It's a wonderful story.

1281
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
That's interesting.

1282
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
But then either of your boys went into that field, into what products or...

1283
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
No, for a tree or anything.

1284
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
No, can started out in forestry.

1285
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And then he would go out and have field trips and he'd get poison oak.

1286
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
And he came back one day and he told us he said, forestry isn't for me.

1287
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
He said, I can't go to the woods.

1288
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And by that time I think he was seeing the writing on the wall too,

1289
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,000
about that it was going to go that way.

1290
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
So he changed and went into business.

1291
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And neither of the girls was ever interested.

1292
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Oh no, girls, in that air I don't see.

1293
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
They were just starting to come into being...

1294
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I think they just had one or two girls in the forestry school.

1295
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And my dad didn't approve of that.

1296
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Yeah.

1297
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
He still had a big influence on your family.

1298
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Oh yes, he surely did.

1299
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Excuse me.

1300
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Sure.

1301
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Who this could be?

1302
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Oh, I'm stiff from sitting there.

1303
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Well, we've been here for a little bit.

1304
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Just a package.

1305
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Oh.

1306
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Just a package.

1307
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Okay.

1308
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Always brings the doorbell.

1309
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I didn't know what you know that he's there.

1310
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
So your father was sounds like he was very influential in your life,

1311
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
even after your children were born.

1312
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Oh yes.

1313
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I think he was.

1314
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And he...

1315
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Well, you know, he really...

1316
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
He really ruled the roost.

1317
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Because of his eating with us.

1318
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah, I would say that.

1319
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And the children probably had that sense,

1320
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
like you say, that there were eyes all over the town.

1321
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Yes.

1322
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And he was going to hear about it.

1323
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Oh, he was on the school board.

1324
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
You know, he knew everything that was going on.

1325
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Did I tell you the story about him?

1326
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
They were trying to raise money for taxes.

1327
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
The school board was.

1328
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
The man came to Lions Club.

1329
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And my dad was very prominent in the Lions Club.

1330
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
He was the one who started...

1331
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I don't know if you've been reading these articles

1332
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
that Ken Munford's been putting in.

1333
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Yeah.

1334
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And he was one of the principals who started the Avery.

1335
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Right.

1336
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
And...

1337
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Well, anyway...

1338
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
What was I going to say about that?

1339
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yeah.

1340
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
He was in so many...

1341
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Oh, I know.

1342
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
So the superintendent of schools,

1343
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I think it was Dr. Van Lohn.

1344
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:08,000
And he came to the Lions Club and made a plea for them

1345
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
to all vote for the increase in school property taxes.

1346
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And my dad got up and he said,

1347
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Oh, I'd feel more inclined to vote for this.

1348
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
He said...

1349
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
You can keep going because the other one will catch you.

1350
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Yeah.

1351
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:36,000
He said, my grandson was just kicked out of the first grade.

1352
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And something about one of the other kids.

1353
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Ken was kicked out of the first grade because he was a big boy

1354
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
and he had a little bitty teacher for a teacher.

1355
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And she sent a note home and said that he was misbehaving

1356
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and what was I going to do about it?

1357
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And so I went down to see about it and I said,

1358
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
what does he do?

1359
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
And she said, well, he won't keep his feet under the desk.

1360
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And she said, I tried putting him out in the hall

1361
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and he just sat out there and visited with everybody

1362
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and enjoyed himself.

1363
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
So she said, I guess that's not the way to handle it.

1364
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And so I looked at her and I said,

1365
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
where does Ken sit?

1366
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And she said, there.

1367
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And I said, well, you know if you go down to the sixth grade

1368
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
and get a desk, the fitting,

1369
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
you could probably...

1370
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
you probably wouldn't put his feet out in the hall.

1371
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Oh, she said, I never thought about that.

1372
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So anyway, my dad told this story at the Lions Club

1373
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and the old Dr. Van Lone came up afterwards and he said,

1374
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
TJ, when you've got something like that,

1375
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
would you just come and tell me privately?

1376
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But you know, he had a lot of clout

1377
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
because he wrote all these letters to the editor

1378
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
and had an opinion on everything.

1379
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And so the kids were pretty well.

1380
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
You know, if they didn't see pop,

1381
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
somebody's friends would see them.

1382
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So they were pretty well.

1383
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Did I tell you that I used to worry?

1384
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,000
He would have articles in the paper

1385
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
about how many acres of timber land he owned

1386
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
and something like this.

1387
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And I think, oh, why do you put it in the paper?

1388
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
It was about the time of the Lindbergh kidnapping

1389
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and I was so worried that somebody...

1390
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I think you were an easy target.

1391
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Oh, yeah.

1392
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And I worried about that a lot.

1393
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Nothing ever happened.

1394
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That's a good thing.

1395
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And how about your mom?

1396
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Was she involved with your children?

1397
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
She was a good babysitter.

1398
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And you know, she had that cart that was the golf cart.

1399
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And she would come by in the afternoon

1400
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
and take the kids in the golf cart.

1401
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
And she had to go down to the grocery store.

1402
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
She'd take them with her.

1403
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Oh, it was fun.

1404
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So she was very much involved with the children.

1405
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I think she was more in jail with Bonn and Bart

1406
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
because Bruce and Betty traveled more than we did.

1407
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And she often kept them for several weeks at a time.

1408
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And then I would kind of take them for periods of time

1409
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
because I knew she needed to break.

1410
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Because, you know, she was getting older.

1411
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
And so the boys...

1412
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
The boys came down and made a lots of logging roads

1413
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
with the trucks that my husband made.

1414
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
When he worked at...

1415
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
He worked at another business.

1416
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And I forgot the name of it in Portland.

1417
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
But it was during the war, beginning of the war.

1418
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And the V...

1419
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Not World War II, but World War...

1420
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Was it Vietnam?

1421
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It was next.

1422
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Probably Vietnam, yeah.

1423
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And he worked at this die casting company.

1424
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,000
And they made log trucks for kids' size.

1425
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And the employees were allowed to take parts home

1426
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
that were not perfect.

1427
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And so Kermit would bring them home.

1428
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And he made, I don't know, six or eight log trucks.

1429
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
And these were big log trucks.

1430
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
They were about like that.

1431
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
And paint them.

1432
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
They had to buy the tires.

1433
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Little tires like that.

1434
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
But he would...

1435
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I think Kathy still has those log trucks.

1436
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I think that he made six or eight of those.

1437
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And he would convert them to flat beds or dump trucks.

1438
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Or he would make little...

1439
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
The dump trucks would...

1440
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
He sort of changed the configuration of some of them.

1441
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And the Bonn and Bart and Ken and Craig

1442
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,000
would make logging roads all over the place.

1443
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
They loved to do that.

1444
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And they would play.

1445
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And it was really no trouble for me to keep them sometimes

1446
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
to give my mother a rest.

1447
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Sure, yeah.

1448
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Were they about the same age as your boys?

1449
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Yes, well, there was Craig.

1450
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Let's see.

1451
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Bonn...

1452
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Then...

1453
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Then...

1454
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Kermit came into the family.

1455
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Then...

1456
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Then...

1457
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Ken...

1458
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Then...

1459
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Bart...

1460
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Then...

1461
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Craig...

1462
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And then...

1463
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Kathy...

1464
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And then...

1465
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Kim came along later.

1466
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
So we...

1467
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
The boys were pretty well.

1468
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Yeah, so they were pretty much the same age.

1469
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Did you guys do holidays and things with their family?

1470
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh, yes.

1471
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Christmas and...

1472
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Now we always had things giving in Christmas with them.

1473
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Uh-huh.

1474
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Huh.

1475
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Oh, that sounds like fun.

1476
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Huh.

1477
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I think you said when you were talking to Wade about Christmas

1478
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
that your dad was a little shocked that your holidays

1479
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
were more extravagance than the ones that you had had

1480
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
when you were growing up.

1481
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Yes.

1482
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Oh, yeah.

1483
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
We gave too much to the children.

1484
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Yeah.

1485
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And I'm saying the same thing about mine.

1486
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah.

1487
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Every generation probably feels that way.

1488
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Yeah.

1489
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Oh, well.

1490
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But it's so much fun to indulge them.

1491
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Um...

1492
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I did have some questions about traveling.

1493
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Do you have any just 503 now?

1494
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Could I ask you a little bit more about traveling?

1495
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Uh-huh.

1496
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
You talked a little bit about your trip that the two of you took

1497
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
to Japan and that kind of thing.

1498
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Um...

1499
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And I'm...

1500
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You didn't take any trips with the children during that time

1501
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
when they were growing up.

1502
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Oh, yes.

1503
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
We did.

1504
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
We took them to Hawaii several times and uh...

1505
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
But we didn't ever take them farther than that.

1506
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I don't think.

1507
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Why is it a big trip for a family of six?

1508
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Yes.

1509
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yes, it was.

1510
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It was quite a...

1511
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Quite a...

1512
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
John.

1513
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Yeah.

1514
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And what island did you go to when you went there?

1515
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Well, I think we went to the big island

1516
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
because we went up to the volcano.

1517
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
We thought that was educational.

1518
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yes.

1519
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Yeah.

1520
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
And uh...

1521
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And then Ken would sometimes come by himself or Craig

1522
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
when they were a little bit older.

1523
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
But we'd take the two girls and then we took the two girls

1524
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
to Australia.

1525
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
But this was when the boys were older

1526
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,000
and Ken was married and Craig was...

1527
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Or was Craig.

1528
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I guess maybe he was married too

1529
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
when we took the girls to Australia.

1530
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
What inspired a trip to Australia?

1531
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
How did you choose that?

1532
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Well, no.

1533
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
What made us go to Australia?

1534
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I think we just started wanting to go...

1535
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
He...

1536
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Kermit always wanted to go that direction.

1537
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
He never wanted to go to Europe.

1538
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I think we just thought that was a good place to go.

1539
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And I think Kathy wanted to go.

1540
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
She wanted to go.

1541
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
It was the time they were building the music center.

1542
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Or like opera house.

1543
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And I think that she was very interested

1544
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
in the way that was constructed.

1545
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Yeah, that's an amazing thing.

1546
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Because Kermit and she spent one whole day

1547
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
of our trip photographing it

1548
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
and walking around it and going through it.

1549
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And she did a report for class at Oregon State

1550
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
and got some credits for doing all of that.

1551
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So she knew from the very beginning

1552
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
that she wanted to be at an architect?

1553
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yes, she did.

1554
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
She loves architecture.

1555
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Wonderful.

1556
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
What is your younger daughter, too?

1557
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
She wanted to be a nurse

1558
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
but she met her husband instead.

1559
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
And so then she took education.

1560
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,000
She's been a school teacher and a substitute teacher.

1561
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
That's wonderful.

1562
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Well, I guess she never was a regular teacher

1563
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
because when they were married, she had twins quite early

1564
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
in her married life.

1565
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And so I think she just did substituting.

1566
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
But she loves teaching.

1567
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
So you've stayed very close with your children.

1568
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Sounds like.

1569
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Oh, yeah.

1570
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
As adults, you're all still here.

1571
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
No, they're here now.

1572
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Kermit and Wald are here.

1573
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
That's right because they're building the courtyard.

1574
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Courtyard.

1575
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Are you involved with that project?

1576
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Well, somewhat, yeah.

1577
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
When they get in a bind, I help them out.

1578
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Not only financially, but otherwise, too, sometimes.

1579
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Because you have that experience

1580
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
with dealing with contractors and real estate things.

1581
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Have you worked with any of your other children

1582
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
on construction projects or real estate projects?

1583
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
No.

1584
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Kermit is very handy.

1585
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
He's like his dad.

1586
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
He's very, he can do anything.

1587
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And Kriks is pretty handy.

1588
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:10,000
But his recreation consists of hunting and fishing.

1589
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Is that something they used to do with their dad, too?

1590
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
The hunting?

1591
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Oh, yes.

1592
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Oh, yes.

1593
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
They always got their deer.

1594
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
We had some forest lands out here.

1595
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And we reserved that for family hunting.

1596
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And so there were other people shooting around them.

1597
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Good idea.

1598
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:37,000
And so they've always hunted and fished.

1599
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Ken doesn't do that much, but Kreg does a lot too much.

1600
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Well, I think it's admirable that you're still so close

1601
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
with everybody.

1602
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Well, I think we're as close as, you know,

1603
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
we talk probably every week, at least.

1604
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Sometimes, you know, if there's something going on,

1605
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
we talk every other day.

1606
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
But, you know, just like Derry called me, you know,

1607
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
he knows what he wants, but he calls me every once in a while.

1608
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
That's my grandson.

1609
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Your grandson.

1610
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
So it's kind of nice.

1611
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1612
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And it sounds like you must have been the kind of mother

1613
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
that everybody was sort of comfortable with.

1614
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Well, I guess they were, because they share, you know,

1615
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
they keep in touch.

1616
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Uh-huh.

1617
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That's a nice thing to be able to say.

1618
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yeah.

1619
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Good.

1620
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Good.

1621
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Well, we could take a break here, as you'd like.

1622
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
All right.

1623
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Next time, we'll go on to talking a little bit about

1624
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
more about your community work.

1625
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And we can, you know, we can start back in these days

1626
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
when you were involved with your kids and trying to work on that.

1627
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Yeah, I had a couple of things here about when we lived

1628
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,000
over on Jackson Street where we had a holly,

1629
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
a whole row of holly trees.

1630
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Uh-huh.

1631
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And so every Christmas, we trimmed the holly trees,

1632
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and then the girls would put the clippings in the wheelbarrow

1633
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
and they'd go up and down Jackson Street

1634
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
and ask anybody if they wanted holly for Christmas

1635
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
and they just gave it to them, you know.

1636
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Oh, sweet.

1637
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So that was kind of nice.

1638
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Uh-huh.

1639
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
That was a holiday tradition, huh?

1640
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Uh-huh.

1641
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Did you have some other holiday traditions

1642
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:37,000
that were different or leftover from your growing up years?

1643
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Well, I don't know that we certainly had food that was very traditional

1644
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:48,000
but, uh, we always had turkey and always had dressing

1645
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:54,000
and, uh, I could tell you some funny stories about that.

1646
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And sew it pudding.

1647
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Uh, that was carrot pudding, steam pudding.

1648
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Mm-hmm.

1649
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
And, uh...

1650
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Interesting.

1651
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And we usually had boiled onions,

1652
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
or pearl onions.

1653
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Uh-huh.

1654
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And cranberry ice.

1655
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You always had that?

1656
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
As an ice cream?

1657
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
What is cranberry ice that is served?

1658
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Well, no.

1659
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
It's an ice that you eat with meat.

1660
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Oh.

1661
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
You know.

1662
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I've heard of that.

1663
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Oh, very fancy dinner has the clear-year palate, you know.

1664
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Is it shaped in balls or...?

1665
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:41,000
No, we always just made it, uh, you know, with a beater.

1666
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And then we scoop it out and put it in a little sherbet dish.

1667
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Oh.

1668
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:52,000
And that was served with all the hot things.

1669
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
With your turkey.

1670
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Sweet potatoes, candy sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy.

1671
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
That's standard menu.

1672
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Always.

1673
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Still is.

1674
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Except for the sew it pudding.

1675
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I haven't heard of anybody making sew it pudding in a very long time.

1676
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Well, we always made that carrot pudding.

1677
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
But it's made with sew it.

1678
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1679
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And, uh...

1680
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:23,000
What do they call the stuff you put on the top of it?

1681
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Uh...

1682
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
You know, you make it with sugar and egg and...

1683
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Meringue?

1684
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
What?

1685
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Meringue?

1686
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
No.

1687
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Uh...

1688
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Why can't I think of the name?

1689
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I guess I haven't thought of it since last year.

1690
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Uh...

1691
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Sugar and egg, and it's not Meringue.

1692
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Well, I can't think of what it is now that we've always put on top of it.

1693
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I can still see my mother sitting in front of the fireplace before we had beaters.

1694
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Uh-huh.

1695
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
You know, and she would whip that stuff, took forever to me.

1696
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Not marshmallow.

1697
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
No.

1698
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Oh.

1699
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Did we talk about the Burlington family and Uncle Gus?

1700
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
No, but I'd love to hear about them.

1701
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
You didn't...

1702
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Well, we've got to talk about...

1703
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
You talked about...

1704
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I know you talked to Wade about Uncle Gus bringing you raisins as a kid.

1705
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Yeah, well, that's what we've done that thing.

1706
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Um...

1707
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Well, I just...

1708
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
The date that...

1709
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I think I was going to look up some dates for you, and Kermit died at 59, and he died in 1979.

1710
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Okay.

1711
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Have you been ill at all before that?

1712
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Well, not to...

1713
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You know, he always was not just...

1714
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Well, we didn't...

1715
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I think that we always thought that he was fragile, but you know, but didn't realize what it was.

1716
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
You know, in those days, heart things were...

1717
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
It was very different then.

1718
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Yeah.

1719
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Well, we made a big strides in heart.

1720
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Well, I guess that's all I had on my little...

1721
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, and I think, oh, we need to talk about this.

1722
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Yes.

1723
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
That's a good thing.

1724
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I'm glad you took notes.

1725
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,000
And if you think about it, things definitely bring them in.

1726
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yeah, so Kermit died just of a sudden heart attack?

1727
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Yes.

1728
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:03,000
He was just fine, and we had come back from a trip to Mexico, and he went down.

1729
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
He was building a photography studio in the basement.

1730
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
He thought he'd take up photography's kind of an application.

1731
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:20,000
And he came upstairs, and he said, are you ready to go and do errands downtown?

1732
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
And I said, yeah, I'm ready just as soon as I finish this note.

1733
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And I said, I'm writing thank yous to the people that have been nice to us to.

1734
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:35,000
In Mexico, and all of a sudden I looked over and he was laid out on the bed.

1735
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
And I said, Kermit, what's the matter?

1736
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And he just kind of looked at me, you know, and I went over and I felt his forehead, and it was just sweaty.

1737
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And I said, what is the matter?

1738
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I said, I think I'd better call the doctor.

1739
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
He said, yes, I guess so.

1740
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And I think he knew what he had.

1741
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But I didn't at the time.

1742
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And so I called the doctor, and he said, get him to the hospital, get him to the hospital.

1743
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And so I said, can you walk out to the car, and he said he thought he could.

1744
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
So he did, and then he threw up.

1745
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:18,000
And, you know, I ran to get a pan so that we could, if he threw up again,

1746
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
we could, didn't need to stop and we got him out to the hospital.

1747
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And some little man came up.

1748
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I didn't know him from Adam.

1749
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And I think he thought that he, that I knew who he was.

1750
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
He apparently was the heart doctor.

1751
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And I didn't know him from Adam.

1752
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And as all he said to me, he says, your husband's a very sick man.

1753
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And I thought, well, what's he sick about, you know?

1754
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I said, well, can I see him?

1755
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And he said, yeah, go and see him.

1756
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
But I'm still didn't know they had a heart attack.

1757
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And so he lived that day.

1758
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And then the next day they took him to Portland, OHSU.

1759
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And it was February and it was, I see, oh, there was this much ice on the streets everywhere.

1760
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
And I didn't think we'd ever make it uphill hill.

1761
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:15,000
But the ambulance, I don't know if they had chains or not, but they made it up the hill.

1762
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And I knew he was very sick when they made everybody get out of the elevator and let us in.

1763
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I knew that there was something bad going on.

1764
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
So he just lived that night and he was gone the next day.

1765
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
So my life changed.

1766
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Yeah.

1767
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Yeah, I feel like a really sudden change.

1768
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
You never know what the future brings so you better live every day.

1769
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Yeah. Well, it sounds like he did live.

1770
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
He sounds like he enjoyed his life.

1771
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Oh, he did.

1772
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
He enjoyed every day.

1773
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Yeah.

1774
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
And lots of good hobbies and travel.

1775
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Yeah.

1776
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
It's still too short.

1777
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Thank you for telling me about that.

1778
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Yeah, I'm eager to talk to you too about, I try to imagine you stepping into,

1779
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
taking over there at the property business and that sort of thing at that point.

1780
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I guess you had been so involved that it wasn't that big of a leap.

1781
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,000
No, it wasn't because I think he had a premonition all the time that he would,

1782
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:45,000
that I would outlive him because my family had sort of an older reputation of whatever.

1783
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And his family had always died suddenly.

1784
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And so he was pretty insistent that I be aware of everything that was going on

1785
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
and financial things.

1786
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
We always talked over every deal.

1787
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So I just went on from there.

1788
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I just picked right up and kept moving with it.

1789
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Good.

1790
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Next time I'd like to talk more about not only your community activism.

1791
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I have said many times that hate is like an asset that does as much damage

1792
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:33,000
to the vessel in which it is stored as to the object on which it is poured.

1793
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,000
The other one is Gem of the Day, when the tide of life turns against you

1794
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:48,000
and the current, current upsets your boat, don't waste tears on what might have been

1795
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,000
just lie on your back and float.

1796
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
That's wonderful.

1797
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Those are the two things that I look at.

1798
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Yep, words to live by.

1799
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Beautiful.

1800
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Keep all that stuff there handy.
