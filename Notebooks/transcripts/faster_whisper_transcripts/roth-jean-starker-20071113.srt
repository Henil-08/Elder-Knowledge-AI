00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
This is Maya Fischler. I'm in the home of Jean Starker-Raw and today is November

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:16,000
13th, 2007. Today, Jean and I are going to be talking about some of the community

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
activities that she's been involved with and I'd like to ask her some questions as

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,160
well on a more philosophical side of things asking her to reflect a little bit

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,159
about her life and some of the things that she's accomplished.

6
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:41,159
Okay, so when we left off last time, you had just told me about

7
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:51,159
Kermit's passing. At that time, your children were grown. Almost everybody was out of

8
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,159
the house and in college and that's it. Except for Kim. Kim was still here.

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,160
And she was in the sorority house. She was the same. And then when her dad died,

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:09,159
by then she moved home to be with me. And she was engaged and to be married in

11
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:19,159
June of that year, he died in February. So she said she'd come home and stay with me.

12
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:25,159
So I got to know my future son-in-law quite well during that period.

13
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:33,159
But it was a very tough time to be enthusiastic about a wedding.

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,159
And you know, I knew Kermit wasn't going to be with us.

15
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,159
Anyway, that was where that stood, I guess.

16
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,159
Did you have other friends and that sort of thing at that era who were really

17
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,159
comfort to you sort of took you through that difficult?

18
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,159
No, not really. Well, I shouldn't say that. There were a couple of

19
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:09,159
couples that really stood by me. But it's amazing in that era.

20
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:15,159
And I think it's true today. When you are no longer a couple,

21
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,159
it's a different story. Different socials.

22
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,159
Yes. And I had one lady tell me very bluntly. She said,

23
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,159
well, I won't be inviting you to dinners anymore. It makes an uneven number.

24
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,159
Interesting. Yeah. And so, you know, people see things differently.

25
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:43,159
But, um, I'm Izzy Hall of CH2M Hall. She was a,

26
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,159
she and Jim were wonderful support. And I've always,

27
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,159
and now I'm kind of supporting them because Jim has a disease

28
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:03,159
that he will not get well from. And so, I try to take her out to

29
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:11,159
lunch and do things with her now. So, you know, it all comes full circle.

30
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,159
Yes, it does. Yeah, that's an interesting statement.

31
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,159
Because I think that has probably changed in this generation.

32
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,159
I don't think there is that same sense that you only socialize with couples.

33
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,159
There's a lot more relationships among women. Yes, that's right.

34
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,159
When there was at that time. And you've probably built those kind of

35
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:39,159
issues. Yes. And you know, the thing of it is that,

36
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:47,159
I think that people don't realize when you're in your 50s,

37
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,159
what it's going to be like when you're alone in your 80s.

38
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,159
And people are much more aware of that, I think,

39
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:05,159
now when they used to be. People were more self-centered, I think.

40
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,159
And then the other thing that I think about my life is that,

41
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:15,159
Herman and I did everything together. We weren't big on going

42
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:21,159
places with other couples. We went with our family.

43
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:27,159
We went fishing. He went hunting with the boys.

44
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,160
And I did my little things with the hospital and that sort of thing.

45
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,160
But basically, we did our social things just together.

46
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes. So you had a really special bond and that's hard to recreate.

47
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
That's right.

48
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,160
So what kind of things did you do in that time to kind of move

49
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:03,160
you through the morning stage? Well, I did the wedding.

50
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,160
And that was a full-time job. I can imagine.

51
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,160
And of course, when a person dies, there's so much to take care of.

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:23,160
And as I've mentioned before, I had very little money that was coming in routinely.

53
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,160
I had to figure out how I was going to support myself.

54
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,160
And whether I had to go back to work or what I was going to do.

55
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Because we had a lot of assets, but we didn't have any cash flow.

56
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:49,160
And so I hired a man to manage the forest lands that were left over from the mill.

57
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,160
And as I've said before, I trusted him implicitly.

58
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:07,160
But I really didn't feel like I had a handle on it because I didn't know anything about Timberland and managing it.

59
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:15,160
And so he did a lot of work on...

60
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I don't know what they call that.

61
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,160
He drew pictures of the forest and then where we should log

62
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,160
and what we should do with different sections of it.

63
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:39,160
And I wish I could put that better. But anyway, that went on for a couple of years.

64
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,160
And when I needed some money, I'd say, you know, got him log.

65
00:06:47,160 --> 00:07:01,160
But then I decided that after I got my wits about me and got kind of settled down, I thought, well, you know, I know a lot about real estate and how that works.

66
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,160
So I think I'll do a 1031 just like my father did.

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:21,160
And so I sold off the Timbermanager surveyed the Timberland that I wanted to sell first

68
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,160
and to see how much I could get from that.

69
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,160
I found a building that I could buy.

70
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:37,160
And so we exchanged those two and that worked out so well that I did it four more times.

71
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Because that gave you at least a regular source of rent.

72
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,160
That's right because I had the money coming in from the rents from the real estate.

73
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,160
And then I knew how much I had to spend.

74
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,160
So anyway, that worked out very well.

75
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,160
And it's still to this day I own those properties.

76
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
You said the BIMART property was one of those two?

77
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Well, the BIMART was a little different because I had inherited that from my mother's estate.

78
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
So that was a little bit different.

79
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:21,160
But it also had a 30 year lease on it which was just peanuts.

80
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You know, because it was so such an old lease.

81
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Why my father did that? I do not know. But anyway, there wasn't much income from that.

82
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,160
I see. Not like it is today.

83
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Yeah. Is that still your property today?

84
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,159
I own that corner there.

85
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,159
Ninth and circle.

86
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,159
And it's been very...

87
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,159
Now that I have a decent lease,

88
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,159
why it gives me some income.

89
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,159
That's good.

90
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,159
So you got involved in your real estate business.

91
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,159
And was at the time that you sort of started getting involved in community activities.

92
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,159
Yes.

93
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:15,159
And I had always been interested in the hospital because my dad had always...

94
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:25,159
He was one of the movers and chakers when the hospital was in bankruptcy down here on the Harrison Street.

95
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:33,159
And he and a group of other men pulled that hospital out of the...

96
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,159
Got it going again.

97
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:49,159
And then my husband was interested in the hospital and served on the board of the hospital when they moved from Harrison out to the hill.

98
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,159
And so I was always involved in the auxiliary.

99
00:09:53,159 --> 00:10:03,159
And my mother and Mrs. Ed Woodcock were the two ladies who started the held a tea

100
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,159
and asked women to come.

101
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:11,159
And that's how the auxiliary started the present hospital.

102
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,159
That's interesting.

103
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,159
So that we were always involved as a family more or less in the hospital.

104
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,159
And of course I'm a wind kermit guy.

105
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:33,159
They made me an honorary trustee of the trustee board.

106
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:45,159
And so I've been very active in that and helped raise money for the various projects that they've had like the pastega house.

107
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:53,159
I was co-chair with the heart center with Mario Pastega.

108
00:10:53,159 --> 00:11:01,159
And then I also supported him when he wanted to do his house.

109
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,159
They call it the house.

110
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:09,159
And so he and I worked together real closely on that.

111
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,159
Fundraising for the most part.

112
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,159
Yes.

113
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,159
And were you also involved in a cancer center there at the hospital?

114
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,159
Yes.

115
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:27,159
And the hallway out in that building is named for kermit.

116
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,159
Was that his project as well?

117
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,159
No, really.

118
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,159
I think that was pretty much my project.

119
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:39,159
But it was one of the first fundraising projects that I had.

120
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,159
Because I knew a lot of people in town.

121
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,159
And I kind of knew who to ask.

122
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,159
Yeah, that's what's important.

123
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:59,159
You have a long list of things that you've been involved with here.

124
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,159
And I could ask you about each one of them.

125
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,159
But you could also just tell me to direct me a little bit.

126
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,159
Which ones you feel are your major points of pride?

127
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,159
Well, of course the park is very much.

128
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,159
And that was an interesting how that came about.

129
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,159
I yielded or built this house.

130
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:35,159
And when we were through building it, he came to me and asked me if I would loan him some money to

131
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,159
he owned the corner where the park is.

132
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,159
And he had plans drawn up and he was going to build a big high rise.

133
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,159
Something rather there of office buildings.

134
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,159
And I said, no, I said, I don't think that's what ought to be on that corner.

135
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,159
And I said, the chamber is next door.

136
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,159
You're going to hide the chamber of commerce building.

137
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:08,159
And as people come over the bridge, they will not see where the chamber is.

138
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,159
And I said, I don't think that ought to be built on that corner.

139
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,159
Well, he picked up on that.

140
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,159
And within, I think it was just two or three weeks.

141
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,159
There was a period of time.

142
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:32,159
There was a consensus between the university, the city, and the chamber.

143
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,159
And they all pitched in and bought that property from Ike.

144
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,159
And then they came to me and asked if I would landscape it.

145
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,159
And so that's how Kermit's name is on that part.

146
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,159
I see.

147
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,159
So that all worked out just fine.

148
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,159
Everybody was happy.

149
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:58,159
And I still look after it.

150
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,159
And I get after them when they don't keep the park up.

151
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:13,159
Because I have also donated funds to the N County Foundation for the purpose of keeping that park up.

152
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:19,159
They're supposed to use it for the, you know, to put in some perennials and that sort of thing.

153
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:27,159
And now I'm after the chamber because their trees have grown up so much that you can't see their building.

154
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,159
And I think they ought to take those trees down.

155
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,159
And so that when people come over the bridge, they can see where the chamber is.

156
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,159
That's true.

157
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,159
Yeah.

158
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,159
So anyway, I'm working on that.

159
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,159
That's good.

160
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,159
I've never stopped that kind of thing.

161
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,159
Keep them spiffed up there.

162
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,159
Now let's see.

163
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:54,159
The other thing I think is that I belong to the homeic.

164
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,159
And that was started.

165
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:04,159
My interest in that was a long, long, long ago.

166
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:15,159
Maria Saker was the lady in charge of the homeic part of the State Extension Service.

167
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:23,159
And she and I had known each other because, of course, I'd grown up in Kervalis and they lived not far from us.

168
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:29,159
Well, when I was teaching school up in McKenzie by, she called me one day.

169
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,159
Was that in Wade's thing?

170
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,159
Well, taking the job within classup.

171
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,159
No.

172
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,159
No.

173
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,159
This is different day.

174
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,159
So I was up the McKenzie teaching in that summer.

175
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,159
Before the summer was out, she called me one to know if I wanted to job.

176
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:58,159
In Lane County, doing work with people who wanted to process their produce,

177
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,159
either canning or freezing or whatever.

178
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,159
And I said, oh, I'd love a job for the summer.

179
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,159
So she said, well, fine.

180
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:20,159
And so then about halfway through the summer, why she called me and she said we had an opening in an Astoria for a war food assistant.

181
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,159
And this is during the war.

182
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,159
Yes, you did tell me about that.

183
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,159
Oh, okay.

184
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,159
Well, then I won't repeat that.

185
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:45,159
And so that's how I got into the extension service because then the war food assistant was then the class of county liked what we did up there with the women.

186
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:58,159
And so they asked, you see extension services is funded by federal state and county funds.

187
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:06,159
And so the county was going to go ahead and do their part to fund the extension service.

188
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,159
And that guy was still going.

189
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:12,159
But I started that whole program up there.

190
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,160
So that was part of the state home economic system.

191
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Yes.

192
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,160
And then you became a trustee on that.

193
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,160
What they call a home demonstration age.

194
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,160
And otherwise known as a home demon.

195
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
That's kind of a positive and a negative.

196
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
That word I guess you could see.

197
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:46,160
And then eventually you became the chair of the College of Home Economic Development Council.

198
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Yes.

199
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
That was the step that you took.

200
00:17:50,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Yes, that was when a Kinsey Green was dean and I was chairman of the advisory committee for probably six or seven years.

201
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:14,160
And then when Tammy Bray became the dean, why she asked me to continue.

202
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
However, we don't have a chairman I don't think as such.

203
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
We just have advisory committee.

204
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I see.

205
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,160
And what are the some of the projects that you did through that group that you wrote?

206
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,160
We raised money too for the college.

207
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:55,160
And we talk about where the college is going, what needs to be done, what needs to be processed in the way of whatever we think that people ought to be thinking about.

208
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:09,160
When Tammy Bray took over that dean ship, it was combined with the College of Physical Education, I think it was.

209
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,160
And then they called it Health and Human Science.

210
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:21,160
And so she came to me and wanted to know about the history of home economic side of that.

211
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,160
And then she had the other group.

212
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,160
And we formed them together.

213
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,160
So now we do both.

214
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I see.

215
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,160
And is that the group that started the Bates Family Study Center?

216
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Yes.

217
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,160
And I was on that committee to help with that.

218
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
What is the purpose of that study center?

219
00:19:47,160 --> 00:20:05,160
It's mostly studies of either children development, which is they have a nursery school there.

220
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,160
And also gerontology.

221
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,160
There is a gerontology department also.

222
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,160
But it's expanded a lot since we started.

223
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I think there's lots of research goes on in there.

224
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I don't know.

225
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:29,160
I think the bone density project is probably in the basement of the women's building.

226
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I don't think it's over at the Bates Center.

227
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:40,160
But it's all intertwined, all of that research.

228
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
So the Bates Center is an actual building?

229
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Yes.

230
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:50,160
And I was on the committee that helped fund that.

231
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,160
We raised quite a bit of money for that.

232
00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Among them was the lady who was the original Betty Crocker.

233
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,160
And she was a graduate of Oregon State.

234
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I didn't realize that.

235
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Yes.

236
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,160
And so I'm trying to forget her name.

237
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Yes.

238
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Anyway, she came out here and worked with us to get it going.

239
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
And took a big interest in it.

240
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:38,160
And of course left us the big sum of money that the major donor of that building.

241
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Because it's named after her.

242
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Well, she didn't like much staying downtown at the hotel.

243
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,160
So she used to come and stay with me.

244
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:56,160
So I enjoyed being with her because we had an awfully good time when she stayed with me.

245
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,160
And then I would take her around where she wanted to go.

246
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,160
That time I drove a lot better than I drive now.

247
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,160
And so I provided transportation for her.

248
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
What was fun?

249
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,160
So was she older than you?

250
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Oh, yes.

251
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,160
She's been gone many years now.

252
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:30,160
She began to go downhill during the time that she gave the money to the family study center.

253
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,160
And then the last time she came out, she really wasn't herself.

254
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,160
She came with a gentleman who was her...

255
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I don't know what you call him, but a consultant for their money.

256
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,160
He took over caring for her too.

257
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,160
But she stayed with me and he stayed downtown.

258
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,160
That's fun.

259
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,160
So I asked Mercedez Bates.

260
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Mercedez Bates?

261
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,160
I have heard that name.

262
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,160
It's an awful way to forget people like that.

263
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
I just did it earlier today.

264
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,160
So you were also involved in the 4-H Foundation at the state level?

265
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Yes.

266
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Because I had...

267
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I think we talked about that.

268
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,160
When I was growing up, I had the daughter of the head of the state.

269
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Harry Seymour was head of the state.

270
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
And I had her...

271
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,160
His daughter for my 4-H teacher, our leader, I guess you'd say.

272
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,160
So I was always active in 4-H.

273
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,160
And when my children came along, they were active in 4-H.

274
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Both of the girls had...

275
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,160
They were state winners in the dress competition.

276
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,160
They took...

277
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,160
I taught them some, but they had a great leader.

278
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Mrs. Wells was her name.

279
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:25,160
They lived out on the corner of Walnut in...

280
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Where's the stop sign at Walnut before you go up the hill?

281
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:38,160
There's a stop light there at 27th and then at 29th.

282
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Well, I think it's the one at 29th.

283
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Because that's the one where you go out 29th and go up and around the hill and then down.

284
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Well, she lived at that corner.

285
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
And she was a great leader.

286
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
She knew a lot about sewing.

287
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,160
And I thought it was better for the girls to get it from somebody else than me.

288
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,160
So they went out there and sewed a lot for her.

289
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:22,160
And then my dad was one of the movers and shakers along with...

290
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:31,160
The guy that was head of the state 4-H, his name.

291
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
We'll have to look that up.

292
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,160
I don't remember what...

293
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
I Burton sticks in my...

294
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Burton Hutton.

295
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Maybe that was the name.

296
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
I can check on that too.

297
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Yeah, put a question right there because I don't know for sure.

298
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Anyway, Burton Hutton...

299
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Well, just say that's who it is.

300
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Came to my dad and he wanted to buy this property over in Salem.

301
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
That was for sale and it was Timberman.

302
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:11,160
And so my dad went over there and the idea was to build a camp for 4-H's.

303
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Well, it was a pretty big project.

304
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,160
And my dad was very involved in that.

305
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:29,160
And so then when it came along, I was a treasure, I think.

306
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I don't know.

307
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I was some officer in the 4-H program that was established to run that camp.

308
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
At the state level?

309
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Yes.

310
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Eventually, we had to sell off half of the Timberland, which just killed me

311
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,160
because it should have been self-sustaining.

312
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:02,160
People don't realize that Timber is a renewable resource.

313
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:09,160
And you just harvested every 40 years instead of every year, like a lot of crops.

314
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:16,160
And so we could have, if we'd been able to save that land,

315
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,160
we could have had it rotating so that we could have always had some income,

316
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,160
but didn't work out.

317
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
But they did save half of it.

318
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:33,160
And now we've got a really wonderful fundraiser, Randy, his name,

319
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,160
but he's last name is.

320
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:43,160
He's great, and he is running the camp, and they're just,

321
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:51,160
and they're getting, what do you call it?

322
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:02,160
I want to say they're applying for fundraising for grants.

323
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
For grants?

324
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Yes, yes.

325
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,160
And so now they're just doing really well, and they're able to keep it up,

326
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
and it looks great.

327
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:22,160
And so I was involved in that as being on the 4-H board.

328
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:30,160
And so I became very interested in that because I wanted to see it go.

329
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Sure.

330
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:39,160
And my dad provided money for the swimming pool of that camp,

331
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,160
and then Kermit and I gave some money for the upkeep of it.

332
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,160
It seems like, in general, you had a few swimming-related gifts that you gave.

333
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Was there a special reason that you were interested in it?

334
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,160
We were always thought that swimming was very important for Oregonians

335
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,160
because we have so much water.

336
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,160
And when we would see people drown because they couldn't swim, we learned to swim.

337
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
We thought that was just terrible.

338
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,160
And so we've always supported water-related activities.

339
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,160
And I still do that because I support, through the Benton County Foundation,

340
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:31,160
I support, for instance, lifts for people to get in and out of pools so they can swim.

341
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:39,160
And then I think we already talked about the girls going to camp.

342
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
To a spring win.

343
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Yes, and they didn't want to go back because it wasn't a swim.

344
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,160
So Kermit and I talked it over and we'd made some money in the stock market

345
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,160
and so we decided we'd give stock to them and so they built their swimming pool.

346
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:02,160
But we wouldn't let anybody know that we'd done that because we didn't want the kids to go to camp

347
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:08,160
and everybody saying, hey, to the swimming pool, you know.

348
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
So it's never been named or anything.

349
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I think that's interesting.

350
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
We didn't want the kids to know.

351
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,160
So did your family always have a swimming pool?

352
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Yes, we always did.

353
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
And your kids were growing up?

354
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,160
At least when Kermit and I, we always had a swimming pool.

355
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Of course, my dad didn't because he supported the 4-H one, but he didn't support family.

356
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:43,160
But we did have a pond out in the woods that we could use in the summertime.

357
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:50,160
But Kermit was, I think, did I tell you about him building that swimming pool?

358
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
No.

359
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Well, when we build our house over on Jackson Street, we didn't have a swimming pool.

360
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:08,160
And so he came home one day and he said, what would you think if we build a swimming pool

361
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,160
across the property across the way that we owned?

362
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:21,160
And he said, I could bring in 12 by 12 timbers and put them together in the corners.

363
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:31,160
And then we could put your paper down for the paint job and then put plastic around it.

364
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,160
And it would be 4 feet deep.

365
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,160
And I said, well, I think that would be great because the kids were little and they could have a lot of fun.

366
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,160
And it was just like a big puddle pool.

367
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
So we did that.

368
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:52,160
And I think that lasted for probably five or six years every year.

369
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,160
We would tear it down and re-put your paper in plastic.

370
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,160
And it would last the summer.

371
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:07,160
And then we decided we'd build a swimming pool.

372
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,160
So we did that.

373
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,160
But it wasn't covered.

374
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,160
And so that wasn't very satisfactory in Oregon.

375
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,160
So when he closed the mail, he came to me and he said,

376
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:35,160
I've got to take the metal off the roof of some of the machinery that are in the mail.

377
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:43,160
And he said, if we cleaned it up and cut off the end where the logs have hit it,

378
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:50,160
he said, I could bring that metal in and we could have a building over the pool.

379
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
And I said, no thank you.

380
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I don't want a metal building in my yard.

381
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
And he said, well, now just wait a minute.

382
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I'll tell you about how we're going to do this.

383
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
It's better than you think.

384
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,160
So anyway, the back part of it was all metal.

385
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:17,160
And then we put boards that was a very nice awning over the front of it.

386
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
That was all wood.

387
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,160
And then we had sliding glass doors.

388
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,160
And from the street you couldn't tell what it was.

389
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
It's still there.

390
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,160
So it covered over the whole pool.

391
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:37,160
And we built a sink and a bathroom out there.

392
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,160
And a boys and girls dressed in rooms.

393
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,160
And it was really a nice little.

394
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,160
As we entertained all the kids in on the campfire, girls, the boys,

395
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,160
girls, the 4-H kids who ever came around.

396
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,160
This was wonderful because the kids were at our house.

397
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
And we knew what they were doing.

398
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Absolutely.

399
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,159
And so it was just a wonderful pool for the kids all the time they were growing up.

400
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,159
That's great.

401
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,159
And so that's still in use over there?

402
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,159
Oh yeah, so.

403
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,159
That's good.

404
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,159
That sort of leads me to my, I wanted to ask a little bit about Kermit's community involvement.

405
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,159
Because I know it sounded like he was also involved in the Scouts to a certain extent.

406
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,159
Yes, he was with the Scouts in Eugene.

407
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:39,159
I don't know what level of Scouting that was, but whatever it was, he used to go out of Eugene to meetings with Boy Scouts.

408
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,159
And it was very active.

409
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,159
And he did a lot of fundraising for the Boy Scouts.

410
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,159
He always said that he didn't like to ask people for money.

411
00:34:52,159 --> 00:35:03,159
But because of his relationship with the Mill, there were lots of times when he had partial lots of something that he couldn't really sell.

412
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:05,159
But they were very usable.

413
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,159
So he would donate those.

414
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,159
He liked in-kind giving.

415
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,159
And he got canoes for the Boy Scouts.

416
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:24,159
And he would ask various people who manufactured things if he thought the Scouts could use it.

417
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,159
And that worked very well.

418
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:31,159
In fact, I still do that a lot with my fundraising.

419
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,159
We try to get in-kind gifts.

420
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,159
Interesting.

421
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,159
Because people don't mind giving things that they've manufactured.

422
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,159
And those canoes were perfectly good.

423
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,159
But maybe they had a chip out of the paint or something they couldn't sell on.

424
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,159
But they were perfectly usable.

425
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,159
Interesting.

426
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,159
Yeah, that's a great service to provide.

427
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,159
Yes.

428
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,159
And giving was his thing.

429
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,159
Interesting.

430
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,159
But he was also involved with the Rotary and other groups around town.

431
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,159
Yes, he was a Rotarian.

432
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:11,159
And after he died, I made him a fellow in the Rotary Club.

433
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:17,159
And he was really fond of the Rotary Group.

434
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:23,159
Were there some things that he was particularly involved with that things that were close to him?

435
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:28,159
I don't remember that he was in particularly involved with Rotary.

436
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:35,159
But he may have been more than I realized I don't know.

437
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,159
But he was involved in the Church.

438
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:43,159
He was a Trustee of the Church.

439
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,159
He did that.

440
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:50,159
He wasn't a joiner, really.

441
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,159
He didn't like to join very much, really.

442
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,159
So he did his work on the outskirts as well?

443
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,159
Yes.

444
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:04,159
That works that well.

445
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:11,159
Another thing I have on the list of your credits is the EE Wilson Foundation.

446
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,159
What's been your involvement there?

447
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,159
Well, I was on that for a number of years.

448
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:28,159
And Fred Zewallon was head of that and managed it from the very beginning when EE Wilson died.

449
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,159
And I knew EE Wilson.

450
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:40,159
And so I guess they thought that I would be interested in managing what he had given to the college.

451
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:47,159
And really wasn't to the college.

452
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,159
It was just...

453
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:57,159
I think it was kind of just given, but he had to have a board managing it.

454
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,159
And Pete Smith lived next door to us over on Jackson.

455
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,159
And he was on the board.

456
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:10,159
And so then he got me involved and I was on that for a number of years.

457
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,159
Is that managing the lands?

458
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:21,159
No, the money that was in the bank that was accumulating interest and so forth.

459
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:30,159
And the duty of the board was to have kids apply for money from that.

460
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:37,159
And then we had to read their applications and decide who was going to get what.

461
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,159
So scholarships for OSU?

462
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,159
Yes, I see.

463
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:44,159
Well, it could be...

464
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,159
As I remember it, it could be any...

465
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,159
I've kind of forgotten.

466
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:57,159
I think it's any Oregon school that I can't remember.

467
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:00,159
That scholarship is still available.

468
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,159
Yes, it is.

469
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,159
It seems to me like it has to be Benton County Youth.

470
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,159
It could be.

471
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,159
I think it is.

472
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,159
Boy, that was a long time ago when I served on that.

473
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,159
I see you haven't done that for a while.

474
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,159
No.

475
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,159
So most recently the things that you're still involved in...

476
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,159
Are you still involved in the 4-H or the economics at all?

477
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,159
Well, I'm still...

478
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:33,159
I serve on the advisory committee for the HOMEC...

479
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,159
HOMEC helped the human side.

480
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,159
And the library.

481
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,159
And the hospital is an honorary trustee.

482
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:48,159
And the museum of Benton County Museum.

483
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,159
That's...

484
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,159
There's a lot of responsibilities.

485
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,159
Well, I've quit the...

486
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,159
Just recently, I've quit the museum.

487
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,159
And I've quit the library.

488
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,159
So I'm down to the hospital and the health and human side.

489
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,159
And you've quit them just to give yourself a little more free time?

490
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,159
Yes.

491
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,159
Yes.

492
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,159
It's just too much.

493
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,159
It is.

494
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,159
But it's an incredible gift to the community.

495
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,159
Do you think that that...

496
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,159
As you were talking about how...

497
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,159
You know, you had a good year in the stocks or whatever

498
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,159
and then you'd give to this cause or another.

499
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,159
Do you think that's still going on at that same level in this day and age?

500
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:33,159
That's the same sense of philanthropy that people of your era had?

501
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,159
No, I don't think so.

502
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:44,159
I think everything now is based on what I can do to get rid of the money for tax purposes.

503
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:50,159
I really think that people give to get their tax off.

504
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:59,159
And of course, I've always believed that I would like to give money to something where I know it's going.

505
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,159
Then to taxes.

506
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:08,159
So I try to give as much as I can and not have to pay tax on it.

507
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:14,159
But it seems like your choice of beneficiaries has a lot to do with your personal interests.

508
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,159
Yes.

509
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,159
Oh, yes.

510
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,159
Absolutely.

511
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,159
Oh, yes.

512
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:25,159
You're personally involved not only in terms of giving money but also in giving an expertise and advice.

513
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,159
Yeah.

514
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:34,159
Because I want to know what they're doing with the money that I've come up with.

515
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,159
I think that makes you different than some other donors too in some ways.

516
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,159
Oh, probably.

517
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,159
A lot of people give money and then they're done.

518
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,159
They don't pay attention.

519
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,159
But I really like to know what they're doing with it.

520
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,159
Absolutely.

521
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:58,159
The one big organization that you've given to is OSU.

522
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,159
We haven't talked about that at all.

523
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:07,159
But I'd love to hear more about your involvement there and all the things that you've contributed.

524
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:12,159
I know a lot of it has been real estate fundraising for various real estate ventures.

525
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,159
Is that true?

526
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:23,159
Well, I think that when you know a lot of all of this stuff that goes on is who you know.

527
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:40,159
And I'm really proud of the fact that there were three ships available or fishing vessels I should say available in Newport.

528
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:49,159
But I had become very friendly with Bruce Maid and his wife Mary-Due and his mother.

529
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:57,159
Because they wanted me to go on a trip and his mother needed a roommate.

530
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:00,159
So I said, well, I would go in room with her.

531
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:06,159
Well, we just got along fine and we just became really good friends over Newport.

532
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:13,159
So anyway, the more I heard about what Bruce Maid was doing,

533
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:23,159
I was very impressed with what he does and his science that he's promoted with whales.

534
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:29,159
So anyway, there were some when the fishing industry over there,

535
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:36,159
and we kind of went kapoot by there were three men who wanted to donate their boats to a issue for research.

536
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:50,159
Well, the trustees, who were the people who say yes or no, there's a little board that does that?

537
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:56,159
They didn't know what did they do about Bruce Maid and never heard of him and didn't know anything about him.

538
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:07,159
Well, I had followed him because he's on BBC and he's on history channels and all of those things.

539
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:16,159
And he was doing great things about tagging whales so that they knew where they were going and what they were doing.

540
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:28,159
And so John Irving was one of the men who was trying to get the board, the boys you board,

541
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:40,159
to accept these ships because he thought it was a great thing for them to be able to re-retrofit them and get them fixed for research.

542
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:49,159
Well, so far they've only done one but they're available but anyway backing up, he called me one day and he said,

543
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:54,159
would I be willing to speak to the trustees about Bruce Maid?

544
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,159
And I said, oh, I'd love to because I really think he does a good job.

545
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:06,159
So anyway, I told him, I said, how many of you know Bruce, the name Bruce Maid?

546
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,159
They looked at each other.

547
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:17,159
So I proceeded to tell him who he was and what he'd done and what wonderful research he was doing.

548
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:23,159
So then they were all skittery shit about the insurance on these boats.

549
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:35,159
But they finally worked it out with, I don't know who, but anyway, they accepted the three boats and I'm really proud of the fact that I kind of encouraged him to do.

550
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:37,159
Absolutely, yeah.

551
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:40,159
But you know sometimes it's just who you know.

552
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:47,159
That's right, and having that personal touch, you know, and willing to be there and say, yeah, I know of this man and I can speak for him.

553
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:49,159
That's right.

554
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:53,159
And I can tell him a little bit about what he does.

555
00:45:53,159 --> 00:46:00,159
His mother, I don't know whether you want to put anything about this in but I think she's such a tear woman.

556
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:05,159
She's just a little short thing. She's probably not five feet tall.

557
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:10,159
She studied under Frank Lloyd Wright and has a registered architect.

558
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:23,159
She studied a library of science and as a degree in whatever library is and she's this one smart lady.

559
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:28,159
She's just a there and has a wonderful sense of humor.

560
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,159
Just enjoyed her knowing.

561
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,159
Oh, that's great.

562
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,159
Unfortunately, now she's in a rest home in Newport.

563
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:48,159
Doesn't have her mind very clear right now, but she's getting older with some of the rest of us.

564
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:55,159
So you've done some work as a lot of work through the foundation as well through the OSU foundation.

565
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:58,159
Well, I'm on the OSU foundation.

566
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,159
I wouldn't say I do much work, but I go and I see.

567
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:10,159
So that's more of being a member of the board and not necessarily any of the things that you're most proud of, huh?

568
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:16,159
No, in fact, I'm not very proud of what they're doing right now.

569
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,159
You won't put that in.

570
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,159
We won't, okay.

571
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,159
All right.

572
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:20,159
You say so.

573
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:31,159
Are there things that OSU that you look at and think I'm so pleased beyond the both that you got for Bruce's project, but are there other things there that you look at and think I'm so glad to have been a contributor to this?

574
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:33,159
Well, the library, of course.

575
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:39,159
I think her library is just one of the nicest ones in the Northwest.

576
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,159
It's amazing.

577
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,159
And I'm very supportive of Carol Butcher.

578
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,159
I think she does some very innovative things.

579
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:55,159
The most recent one that she's done is having that babysitting area that she has and the students can come and bring.

580
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:59,159
If they're studying in the library, they have to stay in the library.

581
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:05,159
But if they're studying, they can bring their children and let them off at this little care center.

582
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:11,159
And they're given a thing like you get in restaurants, you know, when you're in Beeper.

583
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,159
So kind of a beeper?

584
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,159
Yes, a beeper.

585
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:23,159
And so if they need them, they can beep the mother and her father was a case maybe these days.

586
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,159
And I think that's quite innovative.

587
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:28,159
I didn't know about that.

588
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,159
Yes, it's quite a nice project.

589
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:40,159
They have a little, they've done some interesting things with the plumbing because of course they needed to toilet.

590
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,159
And it's a little, really nice little porta potting.

591
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:49,159
And so they didn't put in actual plumbing.

592
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,159
But I think it's very well designed.

593
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:59,159
And they have students in there that are learning childcare.

594
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,159
I think it's just a great project.

595
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,159
I'll have to check that out.

596
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,159
Terrific.

597
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,159
Well, and you're such a beaver fan.

598
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,159
Oh yes, I'm a beaver.

599
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,159
That should definitely be in there too, I think.

600
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:26,159
Well, you know, since I've lived in Kerala's all my life, there's no, you know, I had three out of my four children go through Oregon State.

601
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,159
And my husband was a graduate of Oregon State.

602
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,159
And I've worked for the college through the extension service.

603
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:41,159
And you know, we've just been involved in the university all our lives.

604
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:45,159
And of course my father worked at the university.

605
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:50,159
And you know, you're just kind of all, that's where your life has been.

606
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,159
That's right, yeah.

607
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,159
But I love the fact that you still go to the football games.

608
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,159
Oh yes, oh yes.

609
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:00,159
Oh, that football game Saturday night was something.

610
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:02,159
It's like that they're doing so well this year.

611
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:04,159
He was just so proud.

612
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,159
But all the officiating was aww.

613
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:08,159
Was it?

614
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:09,159
It was just terrible.

615
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:17,159
And even Mike Riley, who calls the games for the radio, he said it was the worst officiating he'd ever seen in his life.

616
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:19,159
That's a statement.

617
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,159
Yes.

618
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:27,159
And the paper, I think Riley asked him to downplay it probably.

619
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:31,159
But he's a very low key guy.

620
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:35,159
But boy was he upset with the officiating.

621
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:39,159
He called one of the plays, you know, and asked him to read through it.

622
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:40,159
Really?

623
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,159
And they did change it.

624
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,159
So yeah, it was a feisty game.

625
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,159
Good, good.

626
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,159
And you still go to those with your family?

627
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,159
Yes, in fact, I did go with my daughter and son-in-law this time.

628
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,159
Sometimes I use tickets for guests.

629
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,159
I like to entertain that way.

630
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:07,159
Because I have the tickets.

631
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:10,159
I might as well use them for something.

632
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,159
That's right.

633
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:22,159
Your support of the sports angle of the OSU in general, it seems like that's a particular emphasis for you.

634
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,159
Yes, and I really like basketball better.

635
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,159
I go to all the basketball games.

636
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,159
You're not doing very well on basketball this year.

637
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:39,159
But of course, when Ralph Miller was there, why it was just wonderful.

638
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,159
Well, that's good.

639
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:55,159
So are there any other projects that you think you'd like to talk about in here, things that you're particularly proud of?

640
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:59,159
Well, I guess I'm particularly proud of my kids.

641
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:06,159
Well, I would love to get back to that, because we sort of talked about their younger life when we were here a couple of weeks ago.

642
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:13,159
But I'd like to hear about them today and what you're most proud of each of them.

643
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:16,159
Well, Ken's the oldest.

644
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,159
And he lives in Southern California.

645
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:22,159
And he has two sons.

646
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:29,159
And the grandchildren are doing most welcome.

647
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:32,159
Derrick is his oldest son.

648
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:35,159
And he's married to Mindy.

649
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,159
And they have three children now, and they're...

650
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:42,159
She's a...

651
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,159
What do they call that school?

652
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:52,159
Montessori school teacher and has a school in their home.

653
00:52:52,159 --> 00:53:00,159
And Derrick is very handy, and he's made a dollhouse, and he's made slides, and he's made...

654
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:06,159
They have half their yard for the school and half the yard for their own private.

655
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:13,159
And the kids know when they come that they don't go on that side of the yard.

656
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,159
But they just do a whale of a job.

657
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,159
They're growing up to be such fine young people.

658
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:24,159
And I'm very proud of them.

659
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:29,159
And my Ken lives in...

660
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:37,159
I don't know what Ken does, and he's on the California Water Board.

661
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:39,159
He does something about that.

662
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:42,159
He's also done something with hazardous waste.

663
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,159
He's been on committees about that.

664
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,159
Is he an engineer?

665
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,159
No, he really isn't.

666
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,159
He was a business major.

667
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,159
He started out as being a forest major.

668
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:59,159
But every time he went to class, he had a field trip.

669
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:03,159
He had poison oak, and so he had to give that up.

670
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:08,159
And so he was a business major.

671
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,159
And then he got his MBA and...

672
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,159
Oh my god, I did it.

673
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:17,159
Something.

674
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:24,159
But he's dabbled in a lot of things.

675
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,159
And he lives in on ten acres in an avocado grove

676
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,159
and raises those great big avocados.

677
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:33,159
Oh yes, those are great.

678
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:35,159
So good.

679
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:41,159
And his wife is a psychologist.

680
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:46,159
And the children all call her the shrink.

681
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,159
That's great.

682
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,159
And their second son?

683
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:52,159
And the second one was in the military.

684
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,159
What's his name?

685
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,159
Danny.

686
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:55,159
Danny, huh?

687
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,159
And he was in the military for about ten years, I think,

688
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,159
and married a really nice girl.

689
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:04,159
And they have two children.

690
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,159
And he's out of the military now,

691
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,159
and taking auto mechanics.

692
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,159
Well, I guess you'd say mechanics,

693
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:21,159
because I think it's a combination of auto and airplane mechanics.

694
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:24,159
He likes to work with his hands.

695
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,159
So he does that.

696
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:31,159
Then Craig's the next boy.

697
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:37,159
And he lives in Bend.

698
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:44,159
And he does, well, I don't know what Craig does.

699
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,159
He runs some sort of a business called Bad Checks.

700
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:55,159
And he takes checks that are bouncing

701
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:57,159
and does something with him.

702
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:00,159
And I've never been able to figure out what he does.

703
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:02,159
But anyway, he does that.

704
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,159
And then he's a hunter and a fisherman.

705
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:13,159
It seems to earn enough money to play quite a bit.

706
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:18,159
And he also has some friends who are quite wealthy.

707
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:24,159
And he goes with them a lot because Craig's a fun guy.

708
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,159
So you have children as well?

709
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:29,159
Yes, he has two.

710
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,159
And what is going to school here at LVCC?

711
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,159
And is going to be...

712
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:44,159
She's studying to be a...

713
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,159
Well, I don't know what she's studying to be.

714
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:52,159
Anyway, she's going to school.

715
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,159
What's her name?

716
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,159
Tracy.

717
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:55,159
Tracy.

718
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:59,159
And then Mackenzie goes to Skad,

719
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:06,159
which is Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia.

720
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,159
And she's studying jewelry.

721
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,159
And she apparently is very good,

722
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:16,159
because she just designed some piece

723
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,159
that the teacher is taking to Hong Kong to show

724
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,159
some group that are over there.

725
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,159
I guess it's quite a thing in her butt.

726
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:36,159
She has been thinking that she would like to buy a Savannah house,

727
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,159
you know, an antique house of some sort.

728
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:45,159
And have a store below, a jewelry store below, and live above.

729
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:50,159
So she's got her life all figured out.

730
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:55,159
Then there's Kathy, who lives in Portland, K-A-T-H-Y.

731
00:57:55,159 --> 00:58:02,159
And she's married to Mead Clifford,

732
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,159
which is kind of interesting,

733
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:09,159
because you know, we have a man over here who was Clifford Mead.

734
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:11,159
I do.

735
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:14,159
And the...

736
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,159
A Linus Pauling Institute.

737
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,159
Right, to the University.

738
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:24,159
So anyway, you've got to be careful with which way you get that.

739
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:31,159
And he was a man who...

740
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:37,159
Man, he called it...

741
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,159
What did he call that business?

742
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:42,159
Anyway, it was storing hospital records.

743
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,159
And he built that up to a very big business.

744
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,159
And then all of a sudden Iron Mountain came in

745
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:55,159
and they were an international company.

746
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:57,159
And they bought him out.

747
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:02,159
So he does some other things now.

748
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:03,159
Did they have children?

749
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:05,159
Yes, they have three.

750
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,159
And the oldest one is Brent.

751
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:13,159
And he goes to school at...

752
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:15,159
Oh, I can't tell you.

753
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:19,159
It's one of the California schools.

754
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:22,159
It's San Diego.

755
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:28,159
It's the Catholic school that's in San Diego up on the hill.

756
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:31,159
Very prestigious school.

757
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:36,159
But I never know whether it's a university...

758
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,159
No, I don't think it's got university in it because it's a private...

759
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,159
It's a Catholic school.

760
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:43,159
They are a Catholic.

761
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:48,159
But he wanted to go to someplace where he could wear flip-flops and shorts.

762
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:51,159
He found it.

763
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:55,159
So he's going to graduate this year.

764
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:58,159
And he thinks he's going to go to law school.

765
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:59,159
That's great.

766
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:03,159
And then Colin is the high school senior.

767
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:08,159
I don't know what I'm going to do about graduation this year.

768
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,159
We've got all these kids graduating.

769
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,159
And Mackenzie will graduate from SCAD.

770
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:17,159
Brent's going to graduate from California.

771
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,159
Colin's going to graduate from Lincoln High School.

772
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:25,159
And you know, how do I want to be able to go always?

773
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:30,159
You'll have to map it out with a calendar.

774
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,159
That's Colin and he goes to Lincoln High School.

775
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:36,159
Was his interest, do you know?

776
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:41,159
Well, the poor kid, he's had health problems.

777
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:47,159
He wants to be an athlete but he just had his tonsils out.

778
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:51,159
And it was a real brutal operation.

779
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:55,159
He was in the hospital for two or three days with tonsils.

780
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:57,159
Yeah, he don't hear about that much anymore.

781
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:02,159
They say that when you're older and you have your tonsils out, it's real rough.

782
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,159
And it was.

783
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:11,159
He just had a few days there of being miserable.

784
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:17,159
So I don't know what Colin will be interested in.

785
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:21,159
He's looking at schools now.

786
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:28,159
And then there's little Brent who is interested in nothing but look-cross.

787
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:30,159
And you said Brent was the oldest?

788
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:32,159
Yes.

789
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,159
Then Colin and then Brent.

790
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,159
Brent?

791
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,159
I see, I got two Brent somehow.

792
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:41,159
Oh, no.

793
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:43,159
Oh, I'm sorry.

794
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,159
Brent is what I meant.

795
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,159
Brent is the oldest.

796
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:48,159
Okay.

797
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,159
And then Brent.

798
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:52,159
Alright.

799
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,159
And Brent's lacrosse.

800
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,159
Oh, that's his.

801
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,159
Lea sleeps, eats, everything.

802
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:00,159
And lacrosse.

803
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:06,159
And I guess he's a pretty good little player because he was chosen as one of two

804
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:11,159
in the Portland district to represent the teams that play.

805
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:15,159
He's played in Philadelphia and this is middle school.

806
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:17,159
Oh, he's still in middle school.

807
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:18,159
That's amazing.

808
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:25,159
And he played in Philadelphia and he played in Seattle and he played in Southern California.

809
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:26,159
Understand that.

810
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,159
I think that's too much for middle school kids.

811
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:31,159
Oh, yeah, but that's what they do these days.

812
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:32,159
Oh, yes.

813
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:33,159
It sure is.

814
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:35,159
And I guess he's pretty darn good.

815
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,159
So that's his passion.

816
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:39,159
And then there's Kim.

817
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:42,159
She's the baby.

818
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:45,159
And she's married to Walt.

819
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:49,159
And she and Walt are now doing the courtyard.

820
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,159
Do you know what you're talking about the courtyard?

821
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,159
And that's Revolence.

822
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:55,159
Revolence.

823
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:59,159
Like they call it.

824
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:07,159
And they've been working really hard to get the students to get it fixed up so that students

825
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:08,159
can live there.

826
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,159
It was in terrible shape.

827
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:16,159
And they've got 14 students living there.

828
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:21,159
And they're the nicest young people.

829
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:28,159
They have to be kind of religiously oriented, not any particular denomination.

830
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:35,159
And they're all enthusiastic about where they live.

831
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:37,159
And they're spreading the word.

832
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:40,159
And Kim said, by next year they'll have a waiting list.

833
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:41,159
I'm sure.

834
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:42,159
Yeah.

835
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:44,159
So are they living here in town while they were here?

836
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,159
Yes, they live out at the end of 29th Street.

837
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:48,159
Oh, great.

838
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,159
Clear up in the hills.

839
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,159
Otherwise, did she live in Portland before?

840
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:52,159
Yes, so.

841
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,159
Has she lived completely down here?

842
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:59,159
And yes, Walt's been an interesting husband.

843
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:02,159
He was an FFA boy.

844
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:12,159
And when he finished college, he had six screenhouses and ran a nursery.

845
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:17,159
And he went to Carter culture in college.

846
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:23,159
But he's gone through all the work for a rubber company and he worked for it.

847
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:29,159
He's always landed on his feet with a very good job.

848
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:34,159
But now they're deciding that they'll do this.

849
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:37,159
Who knows what they'll do?

850
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:39,159
And she was a teacher?

851
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:40,159
Uh-huh.

852
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,159
Yeah, she was trained as a teacher.

853
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:44,159
She's not doing that anymore?

854
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:45,159
No, no.

855
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,159
She's working with Walt.

856
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:47,159
I'm with Walt's.

857
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:48,159
That's great.

858
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:51,159
She was substituting when they lived in Portland.

859
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:52,159
Uh-huh.

860
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,159
Great.

861
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:58,159
And they have twin daughters, Jennifer and Kristen.

862
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:08,159
And Kristen is, she graduated from Seattle Pacific.

863
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:24,159
And in business and has a job in Portland with a computer company that she hates her job.

864
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:26,159
That's good money.

865
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:35,159
And Jennifer has graduated in Home Economics, where we'll help in human science.

866
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:42,160
And she has a job in Portland that she just loves, but doesn't make much money.

867
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,160
It's so often that's a trade-off.

868
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,160
But it's fun that she's continuing on in the Home Economics field.

869
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,160
Well, no, she manages an office for some brokers.

870
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,160
Oh, she does.

871
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,160
She has her degree, but she doesn't use it, huh?

872
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
No.

873
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Oh.

874
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,160
Well, still, she has the same interest that you did in Home Economics.

875
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,160
It's nice that you share that.

876
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,160
Well, yes, she did.

877
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:11,160
And she worked a lot in kid spirit when she was here.

878
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,160
And school.

879
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,160
She worked at kid spirit almost all the time.

880
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
She was here.

881
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:24,160
So it's wonderful that you can even name all these grandchildren and talk about each of them individually.

882
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,160
Did you spend a lot of time with them when they were growing up?

883
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,160
Well, more so with Kim's children than the rest of them because they were in Portland.

884
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:39,160
And well, I spend time with Kathy's children when they were younger,

885
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:46,160
but I don't drive to Portland anymore, so I don't see them nearly as often as I used to.

886
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,160
But I know they stay in touch just from the fact that last time I was here,

887
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,160
one of somebody called me, one of your California grandchildren, called in.

888
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Oh, yeah, they all called.

889
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,160
We think cell phones are just great.

890
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,160
That's good.

891
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,160
Yeah.

892
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:09,160
What were some of the things that you did with them when you could get to spend time with them?

893
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,160
Well, we shopped a lot.

894
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:18,160
And they love to shop with grandma because you know who buys some stuff.

895
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Yeah, my kids are the same.

896
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:27,160
But we did a lot of things together.

897
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:32,160
And we had a lot of picnics together.

898
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,160
Did you ever share your cooking and sewing in those kind of skills with them?

899
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,160
Well, not much.

900
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,160
Maybe making sugar cookies.

901
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,160
They all like my sugar cookies.

902
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:53,160
And this holiday I'm taking the rolls and the sugar cookies for my part of the Thanksgiving dinner.

903
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,160
Oh, that's good.

904
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:02,160
And last night Craig said, I said something about boy who had taken me a long time to make rolls.

905
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,160
I said, I just got as fast as I used to be.

906
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,160
And he said, well, don't worry about the rolls.

907
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,160
Just bring the sugar cookies.

908
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,160
It's kind of priorities.

909
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
That's a good thing.

910
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,159
That's kind of the thing that I'm noted for.

911
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,159
That's good.

912
01:08:21,159 --> 01:08:27,159
Did you have that experience of just finding out how much fun it was to be a grandparent

913
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:33,159
with enjoying your time with them and not having quite as much of the work as you do when you're a parent?

914
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:39,159
Well, I loved when Kim had her twins because she lived in Lebanon at that time.

915
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:44,159
And Walt was still doing the nursery.

916
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:53,159
And so when she and Walt were married, she had another year in school.

917
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:58,159
She was married when she was a junior and Walt was a senior.

918
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:07,159
But her daddy had said, I don't mind you getting married, but he said, you're going to finish school.

919
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:11,159
Well, of course, what happened was that she got pregnant.

920
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:14,159
And then they found out they were having twins.

921
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:17,159
And of course, in the meantime, he died.

922
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:25,159
And so anyway, I said, you know you promised your daddy that if you got married and she said, I know.

923
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:36,159
So anyway, I said, my advice to you is to get busy and she only had her doom teaching to do.

924
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:41,159
And I said, you need to do that before your kids get mobile.

925
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:50,159
I said, it's a lot easier to take care of them when they're in the, in the, in not wandering around.

926
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:56,159
And Walt was home during the day because he was running the nursery.

927
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:01,159
So if there was an emergency, he was there. So that worked out well.

928
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:08,159
So anyway, Kim was able to get a student teaching situation in Lebanon.

929
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,159
So she wasn't far away.

930
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:16,159
And so she finished up and got her degree while she was doing that.

931
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:24,159
But I was over there a lot taking care of the youngsters.

932
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,159
And they'd have full time help.

933
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:34,159
But it was, you know, I like to go over there and help feed the kids.

934
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:35,159
I can imagine.

935
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:36,159
She was a great mother.

936
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,159
She twins didn't bother Kim at all.

937
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:43,159
She, I can still see her sitting on the dab important.

938
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:46,159
One baby would be laying over there and she'd be feeding this one.

939
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,159
And that one would be yelling.

940
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:52,159
And she'd pat him on the back and say, now it's your turn next.

941
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:56,159
Oh, so good for her.

942
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,159
She was a wonderful mother.

943
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,159
Great.

944
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,159
Good.

945
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,159
So with that, last time when I was here and you got that phone call,

946
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:12,159
you were going to be sending down one of your boys' jackets to one of your great-grandson.

947
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,159
Yes, yes, and I did that.

948
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:17,159
And he's absolutely ecstatic.

949
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:18,159
That is so sweet.

950
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,159
Yeah, this one was born.

951
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:26,159
Actually, this one was a red flannel Boy Scout jacket.

952
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,159
I don't know if you know, but that's quite a deal when they get that.

953
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,159
And then they put all their patches on it.

954
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,159
And so this one was all covered in patches.

955
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:43,159
And so I said to Ken, my son, I said, what do you think I ought to do with these patches?

956
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:47,159
And he said, well, I take them off because he needs to earn his own patches.

957
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:56,159
So anyway, I've got them all in a little ziplock bag.

958
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,159
And I'm taking them over to Craig who earned the patches.

959
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,159
And then sent the coat to the cleaners.

960
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:10,159
And it's been sent down to what's his name?

961
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,159
One of those guys down there.

962
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,159
You get the name of the great-grandchildren, I guess.

963
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:19,159
Derek or Danny's kids, huh?

964
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:23,159
Yeah, well, it's Derek's kids.

965
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:26,159
Well, anyway, whoever's getting it.

966
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:33,159
And he said, so Ken called me and he said, boy, is he one happy boy?

967
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:36,159
He said, he's just crazy about it.

968
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,159
And you know, it looked brand-new when it got back from the cleaners.

969
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:41,159
It was just great.

970
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:42,159
That's fun.

971
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:46,159
I mean, it fluffed up all of the sewing that had been on it.

972
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,159
It worked out just really well.

973
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,159
That's good.

974
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:50,159
Good.

975
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,159
Well, are there other things that you saved from when you were a little girl

976
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:58,159
that you have been able to pass on to your grandchildren that they've enjoyed?

977
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:05,159
Well, I don't really think of anything off-hand.

978
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:09,159
Oh, no, I don't.

979
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:15,159
The only thing that I have saved really of Kathy's is that she made a dress

980
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:18,159
with beautiful satin stitch.

981
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,159
I could show that to you.

982
01:13:21,159 --> 01:13:28,159
I think it's a real special little dress.

983
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:34,159
And it's been hanging back there for 20 hairs just because I enjoy looking at it.

984
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,159
Uh-huh.

985
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,159
Do you want to see it?

986
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,159
I'd love to.

987
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:38,159
Well, let's wait till we're done.

988
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,159
We'll go out.

989
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:40,159
We'll go down there.

990
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,159
Unless you need to get up in the stretcher.

991
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:42,159
No, no.

992
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,159
I'm just stretching my legs out.

993
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:45,159
Yeah, we're doing here for time.

994
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,159
Let's see.

995
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,159
Two thirds.

996
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,159
Should we plan to stop at three again?

997
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,159
It's two.

998
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:50,159
It's 20 minutes to three now.

999
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,159
I have to be fine.

1000
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:52,159
Okay.

1001
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,159
All right.

1002
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:54,159
Let's see.

1003
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:57,159
And then we're just about through four.

1004
01:13:57,159 --> 01:13:58,159
We are.

1005
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,159
I think this will be our last formal get together.

1006
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,159
Uh-huh.

1007
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:04,159
I want to keep open the possibility of giving you a call while I'm putting this together.

1008
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,159
Yes, absolutely.

1009
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,159
You might understand me.

1010
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:15,159
So I had some sort of general questions that are more or less reflections on life.

1011
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:19,159
And you could tell me if you're comfortable answering these kinds of things.

1012
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:24,159
But I like to have a little bit of people's philosophy in these books too.

1013
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:30,159
Because I feel like what you're leaving with this book is a statement of your legacy.

1014
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,159
There's so much about your death legacy out there.

1015
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:38,159
And I think, well, Gene has a legacy of her own that she's leaving here.

1016
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:45,159
Do you have a sense of what you want your legacy to be,

1017
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:51,159
what you think your children and your community should remember about you?

1018
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:54,159
Oh gosh, those are hard things to answer.

1019
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:57,159
I should have given you these questions in advance.

1020
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,159
Yeah.

1021
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:10,159
Because I just hope that people remember that I tried to live by the golden rule.

1022
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,159
I guess it's my philosophy.

1023
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:22,159
I'd like to have people treat me like I want to be treated and like I want to treat them.

1024
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:42,159
And I've always kind of lived by that, hopefully, by that philosophy that I don't know really what else to say about that.

1025
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:53,159
I want to feel like I'm on this earth that I'm contributing something to society.

1026
01:15:53,159 --> 01:16:02,159
And I guess that that's why I like to get out and do things.

1027
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,159
Because I don't want to just sit.

1028
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,159
Right.

1029
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:07,159
Just stay active.

1030
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:10,159
And we haven't talked about knitting either, have we?

1031
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,159
I'd like to hear more.

1032
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:13,159
That's one of my hobbies.

1033
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:14,159
You've shown me.

1034
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:18,159
And you actually told me that you got started on that back when you were in high school.

1035
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,159
When you were waiting for your dad to pick you up.

1036
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,159
Right.

1037
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,159
This piece is coming along nicely, though. Are you getting close to the end of it?

1038
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,159
Yes, I'm getting quite close to the end of it.

1039
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:30,159
Just love the colors that you chose for that.

1040
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,159
This is for Colin.

1041
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:33,159
Uh-huh.

1042
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:35,159
And I've made a midday.

1043
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,159
At the end there.

1044
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,159
Oh, did I losing something?

1045
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,159
Not quite.

1046
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:46,159
I've made an African for each one of the children.

1047
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,159
Most of them, at least the ones that have asked for it.

1048
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:50,159
Uh-huh.

1049
01:16:50,159 --> 01:17:01,159
And so he's a big boy and so he wanted something heavy and his mother wanted something that he wouldn't put his toes through.

1050
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:03,159
Good point, uh-huh.

1051
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:05,159
And so that's for that.

1052
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:11,159
But this one is, and you know, we might take a picture of that one time.

1053
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:16,159
Because I'm most proud of this African that I made.

1054
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,159
I think it's the one that I did.

1055
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:22,159
Well, I was waiting for him when he was a football player.

1056
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:27,159
And I've been most of this under a street light.

1057
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:30,159
Waiting in your car while he was at practice?

1058
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,159
Yes, it's gorgeous.

1059
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,159
And I've got a variety of stitches in this one.

1060
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:38,159
So I'm really pleased with this one.

1061
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,159
Now, how did you end up with that if you knitted it for him?

1062
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:43,159
Oh, I didn't knit it for him.

1063
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,159
I'll just knit it for you.

1064
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:47,159
Wow, he was playing.

1065
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:49,159
Oh, I knit it for myself.

1066
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:51,159
It's just gorgeous.

1067
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:54,159
Well, I've had almost a sampler, isn't it, with all the-

1068
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,159
Yes, it is.

1069
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:57,159
It's kind of stitching in it.

1070
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:00,159
But I've knit, I don't know how many of these.

1071
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,159
I knit one for Uncle Norm.

1072
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:07,159
That was my husband's brother.

1073
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:11,159
And he had a real hard time.

1074
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:17,159
When he was getting older, they just kind of chopped him in pieces.

1075
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:22,159
He lost his leg and you know, an arm.

1076
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:24,159
Did you have diabetes, sir?

1077
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,159
No, I don't know what he had.

1078
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:30,159
It's a long time ago and I forgot what he had.

1079
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:36,159
But anyway, he needed a blanket to keep warm.

1080
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,159
He didn't have very good circulation.

1081
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,159
So I knit him one and I get-

1082
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:44,159
I don't know how many askins I've made.

1083
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,159
I might take a picture of that one too before I leave here.

1084
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:51,159
I'd love to have a picture of that to put in the book as well.

1085
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,159
Well, I think I'm real proud of this one.

1086
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:55,159
Yeah, it's really gorgeous.

1087
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:59,159
It's probably the fanciest one that I've got.

1088
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:02,159
And I do needle point.

1089
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,159
That's a needle point one that I did.

1090
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:06,159
Which one?

1091
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,159
That one.

1092
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,159
The pillow?

1093
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:11,159
Beautiful.

1094
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:13,159
I love the colors.

1095
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:17,159
I have a couple at the beach that I've done in shells.

1096
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:18,159
Wow.

1097
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,159
That sort of thing.

1098
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,159
Oh, I kind of have good eyes for that project.

1099
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,159
Yeah.

1100
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,159
Tiny little stitches.

1101
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,159
I did all of it except the border.

1102
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:33,159
And I got to the point where I just couldn't do those fine stitches.

1103
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:40,159
It was pink on the background too and I couldn't see where I'd been and where I was going.

1104
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,159
Yeah, so who finished it up for you?

1105
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,159
But Kathy, she does.

1106
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:48,159
She does beautiful needle point.

1107
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:58,159
She has inherited more of my clothing and textiles skills.

1108
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:02,159
Ability skills and anybody else.

1109
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:07,159
Kim doesn't like to do that much.

1110
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:14,159
So you've been a single woman for quite a long time.

1111
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:24,159
I'm sure that has its challenges but are there parts of that that have been good for you that have helped you to grow?

1112
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:30,159
Well, I think Kermit and I never got to travel very much.

1113
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:39,159
We did have that one lovely trip to Japan that I think we talked about and how we happened to go to Japan and so forth.

1114
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:48,159
But when this Uncle Norm died, my sister-in-law and I traveled quite a bit.

1115
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:59,159
We probably went on five or six lovely trips and we traveled in Europe a lot because my husband never wanted to go to Europe.

1116
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:05,159
There was something about the World War II that he just didn't want to go to Europe.

1117
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:13,159
But we did go a lot to other parts of the world.

1118
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:18,159
But anyway, Marie and I traveled quite a bit together.

1119
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:22,159
And I always enjoyed that.

1120
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:31,159
And then when my brother died, Betty, my sister-in-law and I traveled quite a bit together.

1121
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:37,159
So I really enjoyed all of that very much.

1122
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:42,159
So it kind of freed you up to have that kind of experience with other people?

1123
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:44,159
Right, right.

1124
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:49,159
And I had enough income then to support some travel.

1125
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,159
So it worked out well.

1126
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:56,159
Yeah.

1127
01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:04,159
When you're traveling, you're sort of seeing the world and seeing however other people live.

1128
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:09,159
Are there parts of that whole traveling thing that really appealed to you?

1129
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:15,159
Well, of course Hawaii is my favorite place because it's clean.

1130
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:19,159
They speak English and money is the same.

1131
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:20,159
It's easy, huh?

1132
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,159
Yeah, it's easy.

1133
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,159
And of course the weather's always good.

1134
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:31,159
And I don't remember who did we talk about Betty and I owning a condominium over there.

1135
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:34,159
No, although I saw that somewhere else and I meant to ask you about that.

1136
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,159
So you have a condominium together?

1137
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,159
We did.

1138
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:38,159
Well, you don't have it anymore.

1139
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,159
No, well, of course she's gone.

1140
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:43,159
She's been gone for several years.

1141
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:47,159
But we were...

1142
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:49,159
She had Alzheimer's.

1143
01:22:49,159 --> 01:23:00,159
And when we decided that we wanted to do this condominium together, we said that we were just going to let the family use it.

1144
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:08,159
Well, all of a sudden I began to hear people were thanking me for going to here and stay in my condominium.

1145
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:15,159
Well, I thought that she was being a little bit presumptuous.

1146
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:23,159
But it turned out that she really had not remembered that we had this understanding.

1147
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:28,159
And so anyway, I said that I didn't give her any reason why.

1148
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:35,159
But I just said that I thought that maybe I wasn't going to be interested in having the condominium anymore.

1149
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:37,159
And she said, well, she'd buy me out.

1150
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:40,159
So it was all very amenable and everything.

1151
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:47,159
And then I realized a few years later that she just really wasn't herself.

1152
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:50,159
So it was okay.

1153
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:54,159
And my nephews just couldn't be nicer to me.

1154
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,159
They're just wonderful boys.

1155
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,159
That's great.

1156
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,159
So when you were in Hawaii, did you do that?

1157
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:03,159
You said Kermit was a scuba diver early on.

1158
01:24:03,159 --> 01:24:05,159
Were you a scuba diver as well?

1159
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:06,159
Yes.

1160
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:13,159
He taught me how to scuba dive and we always went snorkeling.

1161
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:26,159
And I wasn't comfortable going by myself too much.

1162
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:32,159
And so he would always take my hand and go out together and look and then he'd say,

1163
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:45,159
but Betty and I did a lot of that too because she liked to snorkel.

1164
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:52,159
So when we had our condominium, we would go snorkeling almost every day.

1165
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,159
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

1166
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:55,159
How long did you have it together?

1167
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:57,159
About three years.

1168
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,159
That was great.

1169
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:03,159
And I think most of the kids had it once or twice.

1170
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:05,159
They all went over once or twice.

1171
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:14,159
They were at the age where they didn't have a lot of extra money for the fare over and then along the staying.

1172
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:19,159
And so they could manage it every once in a while, but not too often.

1173
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:21,159
It sounds like a real treat.

1174
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:24,159
And you had taken them over quite a bit when they were younger.

1175
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,159
Yes, we'd always gone over on spring break.

1176
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:30,159
That's how it worked out.

1177
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:31,159
Good.

1178
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:38,159
One thing we didn't talk about, I know that Kermit was involved in the church and you've always been involved with the church as well.

1179
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:42,159
Do you consider yourself a spiritual person?

1180
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:45,159
Well, I think I am.

1181
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:54,159
I think I'm not a...

1182
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:58,159
I don't talk about religion too much.

1183
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:04,159
My daughter and son-in-law, Kim and Walter, are very religious in me.

1184
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:12,159
They talk about it all the time and they pray before heels and that sort of thing.

1185
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:18,159
I'm more of a one who keeps their religion kind of to themselves.

1186
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:47,159
And my husband, I think I've got a lot of his feelings in me because he always said that if he dealt with some businessman who broadcast his religion and had visible things on his desk that portrayed his religion.

1187
01:26:47,159 --> 01:27:00,159
It just raised a red flag with him because he said, I know too many men who go to church every Sunday and just pull back by you during the week.

1188
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:05,159
And I think I've inherited a lot of that feeling.

1189
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:11,159
I try to live by the golden rule, as I say.

1190
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:20,159
All right, well, we have just about five more minutes and I think I can limit us to maybe three questions.

1191
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:34,159
The other sort of big picture issue I wanted to ask you about was whether there were any sort of social or political issues that have been important to you as you've come through your life.

1192
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:37,159
Are there any things that have been...

1193
01:27:37,159 --> 01:27:44,159
Well, I'm a firm believer that you should...

1194
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:48,159
What is it about the babies?

1195
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:54,159
I think it should be between your husband and your doctor and yourself.

1196
01:27:54,159 --> 01:28:03,159
And I'm really myth that people can't see that, that it's none of the government's business.

1197
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,159
Yeah, I'm sure I am.

1198
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:12,159
Have you ever been active in any of those kinds of causes or have just a personally held belief?

1199
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:15,159
I'm not a cause person.

1200
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:17,159
That's good.

1201
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:21,159
You've been active in causes sort of...

1202
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:24,159
In the back of your influence, yes, I think.

1203
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:41,159
And I guess the other thing is that in church too, I feel that if you want to be a lesbian, I guess.

1204
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:48,159
The congregational church is big on people being lesbians.

1205
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:57,159
And I had to give up the congregational church even though with my background is in the congregational church.

1206
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:01,159
But it's also in the Presbyterian church.

1207
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:06,159
But I'm a Presbyterian now because I could...

1208
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:14,159
I don't know if you remember this, but probably 10, maybe 15 years ago.

1209
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:18,159
A lady came and was part of the Presbyterian church.

1210
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:24,159
And I think she was the Sunday school teacher that they hired the young people.

1211
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:31,159
And she thought that lesbians were just the best thing that ever happened to anybody.

1212
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:34,159
And she would have...

1213
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:42,159
When she first came, there was a picture of her in the paper almost every week about what she believed in.

1214
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:46,159
And I thought I am just sick of that.

1215
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:51,159
And so the minister came to see me.

1216
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:56,159
And I said, do you advertise what goes on in your bedroom?

1217
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:04,159
Well, no. And I said, well, I don't know why lesbians have to advertise that they're that persuasion.

1218
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:12,159
And so I said, I'm just not going to support the church until you change your rules.

1219
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,159
And so that's...

1220
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:17,159
You've moved on from there now.

1221
01:30:17,159 --> 01:30:22,159
And it was more a matter of how public she was being about it.

1222
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:25,159
Yes, yes. I don't care.

1223
01:30:25,159 --> 01:30:30,159
The whole Mac teachers over here have always lived together.

1224
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:33,159
But they haven't advertised what...

1225
01:30:33,159 --> 01:30:39,159
And a lot of them were just doing it because they needed friendship.

1226
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:42,159
And there's nothing wrong with that.

1227
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:50,159
But to advertise how you feel about your personal, it just calls me.

1228
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:53,159
And I don't mind if you print that.

1229
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:56,159
That's an important stance, I think.

1230
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,159
I think that's good.

1231
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:06,159
If you had to pinpoint what you're grateful for in this life,

1232
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:10,159
you've talked so much about your family and things like that.

1233
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:16,159
Are there particular things that you think about how grateful you are to have had in your life?

1234
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:21,159
Yes, I think I'm grateful for the fact that I've had a good education

1235
01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:27,159
and that I have been able to use it in many different ways.

1236
01:31:27,159 --> 01:31:35,159
And that I've been able to contribute to society.

1237
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:45,159
Yes, and that I've been able to earn enough money to live comfortably.

1238
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,159
And to share what you have.

1239
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:51,159
Yes.

1240
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:57,159
Is there anything that feels unfinished about your life at this point?

1241
01:31:57,159 --> 01:32:05,159
Are there things that you still have left to do or that you feel like you would like to do better?

1242
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:09,159
Well...

1243
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:13,159
No, I don't really think there's any unfinished business.

1244
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:21,159
Well, I don't know that I had any great broad plans to do anything.

1245
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:25,159
It kind of all just sort of evolved.

1246
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:28,159
That's life.

1247
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:33,159
I don't think I had any grand notions of what I could accomplish or anything.

1248
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:40,159
It was just that when the opportunity came and I could see that I could help a little bit.

1249
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:49,159
I took advantage of that, but there wasn't anything premeditated.

1250
01:32:49,159 --> 01:33:06,159
Do you have any advice on thinking about your grandchildren and great grandchildren reading this and wondering if there is anything that you would suggest to them as in terms of an overall way to live your life?

1251
01:33:07,159 --> 01:33:14,159
Well, I think the main thing is that you need to be fair and you need to be honest.

1252
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:24,159
And you need to take advantage of opportunities that are presented themselves.

1253
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:33,159
I just think that it's important that you be happy.
