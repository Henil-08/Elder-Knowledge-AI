1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
Look right into the cameras at the thing to do or look at you or get me yeah, great

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,640
Okay, today is March 7th 2017 and we were with Stephen Strauss who's a distinguished professor of

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,480
Forests Technology at OSU

4
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,839
And we will talk to him a fair amount about his career and his time at OSU

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,879
I'd like to begin by building more of a biographical sketch of your life and ask you where were you born

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,519
I was born in Brooklyn, New York

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,199
Is that where you grew up?

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,640
I was there until I was 16 and I left for college at that point and

9
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,840
Never went back really into various schools and places of employment, but

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,159
Not back there since I started college

11
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,119
Tell me about the Brooklyn of your childhood

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,640
Well, you know, I had a very simple upbringing, you know, my parents then I had a lot of money

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,159
And they also was the fourth child

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,840
And by the time they got to me they were sort of done being

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
uh

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,720
Careful caretakers. So I really had my

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,000
One of the streets as it were I traveled around New York City on the subways and buses extensively and

18
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
Pretty much called the shots came to one as I wanted so I was a bit of a feral kid

19
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,200
So that was fun

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
Tell me a bit about your parents and your family got crowded. Yeah my

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,040
My father was a postal worker second half of his life and

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,440
Worked evenings and enjoyed his job a great deal and had a great network of friends

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,880
And I think he enjoyed being there than more than enjoyed being home

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
With the kids and with my mom

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,880
My mom was a hard worker, but she was sitting overwhelmed I think by the depression and raising two kids and

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
Was sort of mentally run out. Let's say with the time she got to me. So

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
You know very humble simple upbringing, you know, my parents had good values and still didn't me

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,960
You know ten times over the value of getting an education and making yourself better and help me all along the way once they

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,719
Realized I had good academic potential. They kept finding money

30
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,120
They didn't think they had to keep my academic career going so solid upbringing, but also not a great deal of

31
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,439
Mentoring advisement, you know any of the things that I hope I've given to my kids

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Having a better situation

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Can you tell me a bit more about community life and the specific neighborhood that you were in what neighborhood was that?

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,640
It was neighborhood called Barrow Park in New York. It was split roughly 50-50

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
between

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,800
Quite religious Jews many of the Pacific and you know dressed in all the garb and refusing to associate really with

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,640
What you might call mainstream society and then Italians and many of those were Sicilians who were first or one and a half

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,240
Generations off the boat and they were rough and tough and tumble and

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,760
hated Jews as much as the Jews hated them and I grew up with most of my friends who I had a

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,600
secular type of life my parents were Jewish but very reform

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,080
Nothing like the acidic Jews. I was something of an in-betweener

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Where I played with these kids. I was out in the street playing stick ball and football and

43
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,400
You know just just was Italian friends who didn't know what to make of me

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Because they were taught to hate Jews and I was a Jew but not really a Jew because I wasn't like those guys

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,439
And so it was a a strange upbringing that required

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,280
But but some of these these Italian friends are still very close to me even at the stage of my life

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
And so it was you know as they were struggling with many of them over

48
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,960
Getting brutalized at home. I mean, that was normal for this Sicilian culture

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
They came from they came came in five minutes late and they were getting beaten

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,840
And I had a very different kind of upbringing

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
So it was quite amazing to see that

52
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,159
See the acidic Jews see my in-betweener kind of

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,040
Growing up and figure it out from there

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
What were you interested in as you're as before growing up?

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,719
Well, you know the big I was interested in sports. I was just a very active sporty kid

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,680
I still run I referee soccer. I still you know, I follow some of the OSU teams

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
So I'm still a sporty guy

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,520
So these Italians were very athletic and so that was a real connection

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,480
And then probably the big change was you know, it was a gut to a teenage years

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,800
And I started I met friends who were somewhat politically active in protesting

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
being on board

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,960
Being interested in recreational marijuana and things that were very common in the generation back then

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
So I really I moved away from these Italian kids and move further away

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,759
After my bar mitzvah I did get that done because I felt like the family needed me to do that

65
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:49,040
And then I moved away from Judaism moved away from these Italian more rough elements and found a group of friends

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
That you know were more intelligent. They were a mix of

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Jews and Gentiles, but more you would say progressive or left leaning and grew my hair along

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
I had beads

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
In junior high school, I remember that started and became you know

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,879
Fairly politically active one to a bunch of demonstrations

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
As a high schooler and then into college

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
At what point did science became chem something was important to you

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Yeah, you know, I had I went to a high school in Brooklyn called Brooklyn Tech

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,959
So New York City there's three selective public high schools

75
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,399
And Brooklyn Tech is one of the three where there's an entrance exam

76
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,240
And it was it's really a place for training engineers

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
And in the old school engineers were people who just shut up and calculated

78
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,160
And the teaching of science was rough

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
I mean for people who were gifted and mathematics, I guess it was okay

80
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,000
But I was completely turned off to science. I wanted no part of it

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,519
All the teachers the whole education system was

82
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
The opposite of sort of my somewhat progressive interests

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,319
So when I so I graduated I did take the engineering classes

84
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,719
I had to at Brooklyn Tech and did fine

85
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,319
And then when I got to college I went to the state university in New York

86
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,199
I purchased which is sort of an alternative arm of the state university system in New York

87
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
Didn't have grades had all kinds of

88
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,159
experimental

89
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,079
Teaching systems, I majored in philosophy for a year

90
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,920
Or just trying to figure out what I was interested in and so forth

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,159
And really because I was interested in the environment

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,760
And with the save the world

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,880
And I didn't see how a degree in philosophy was going to really help me do that

94
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400
And I was concerned about my economic disability to survive

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,120
So I switched to biology at that point to the interest in the environment and some kind of a job

96
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,920
And then I got into the science track

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,840
I was also I had skipped a grade in middle school junior high school as we called it

98
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
I was born at the end of the year

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I was almost two years immature compared to a lot of my peers

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,160
And I was really confused in college

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
So I was going through these transitions, philosophy, environment, science and just

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,439
And using a lot of marijuana and other things and I was just

103
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
So finally I said time out, I took a year off

104
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
And that was a really smart thing to do

105
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,960
And worked, saved money, did some great traveling, went to Alaska

106
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,080
And was friends and other things and then when I went back

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,560
I was able to transfer to Cornell and become a serious science student

108
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,280
And Cornell was very, very rigorous

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,959
And so really from then till now I've just been bussed in my ass, if you will

110
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,759
Trying to keep up with the incredible pace and demands of being a scientist

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,879
That's interesting, I was going to ask about how a kid from Brooklyn

112
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,519
Becomes somebody who spends his career in the forest and it sounds like it immerse out of this

113
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,120
This political impulse

114
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,399
Political impulse and along with that I began to backpack some with some friends

115
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
When you think about the fires, I remember being very curious

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,640
You know, what's this tree?

117
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
You know, who knows, what does it do?

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,360
And so I got curious about it, I loved the outdoors

119
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,480
There was an element of use of drugs in there that made me sort of just worship in a religious sense

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,920
I had some experience with friends that were just, you know

121
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,400
I still think of this day, these friends of ours

122
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Friends of mine, you know, talk about how

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,320
How

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Magical it was to sort of see the environment, love the environment, be out there, bond

125
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
Try to understand it, try to think about being a caretaker of the environment

126
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,000
And so it was inspirational

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,960
It was what it was, you know, all that infusion of the youth and the

128
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,720
The feeling of the need to save the environment and then with sort of recreational

129
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,960
Uses and drugs in the comradeship, I just became passionate about it

130
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,160
So it's

131
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
I don't want to overemphasize a drug part of it except that it gave a great sense of joy and

132
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,079
Sort of sharing that you know, what happened anyway, but maybe it was more intense

133
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,839
Yeah, how did you select Cornell or did the Cornell select you?

134
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,799
Well, I selected Cornell, you know, with my limited

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,559
Knowledge base growing up in Brooklyn and my parents, you know, working class and the other one of them had a college education

136
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,800
You know, we always assume the next thing you do is go to Brooklyn College or some very affordable nearby place

137
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,120
Because you couldn't possibly afford to go to high out of town school at a long Cornell

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,920
And my sister was sort of five years ahead of me and she said if it broke in the the thinking shackles

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,280
That you know, we could do better that we could retire and she encouraged me to apply and one thing nice about Cornell

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,080
It's very selective, but there's also it's a hybrid really between a state supported

141
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,360
University and a private university and biology is actually split

142
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,040
I think it still is there

143
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,720
So if you get into biology and you're a resident of the state of New York, your tuition is about half

144
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,720
So I made it suddenly affordable whereas it wouldn't have been otherwise

145
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,200
And then I started getting a bunch of scholarships because I really worked hard and got very good grades

146
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,680
And then like I said and when my father realized that I was getting a A's at Cornell who was this kid he started just

147
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Paying off debts and stuff

148
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,400
It sounds like this is an important moment in your life Cornell. Yeah

149
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Yeah, just it was the

150
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,720
The start of you know a whole new person that you know, wasn't this wasn't this kid in Brooklyn

151
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,840
But was someone who was going somewhere and

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
You know, I started working with an ecologist a Cornell

153
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,520
It's also taking all these courses in biology and evolution that you know blow your mind

154
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,200
You know and suddenly you're thinking about all this big big stuff and

155
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,160
Also thinking about saving the world and

156
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,600
You know, I still never saw myself as a professor or a scientist. I just really I'm able to do that

157
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
But you know, I get a degree and then I think well a great. I have a bachelor's now

158
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,280
What do I do with it in the world of biology you are a technician for somebody?

159
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
And then you think about well, I get a master's and it's really the same thing

160
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,180
And so it really be a scientist to be somebody who calls the shots whose thoughts and intellect and ideas

161
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,620
Or what drives what happens

162
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,800
You need to in science you need to move on to get PhD even beyond, you know, you need to get a postdoc

163
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
So I just never got off the train

164
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Because I realized I needed to stay on it though. I never imagined myself

165
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,800
Being a scientist with my my humble upbringing. So it just kept going and I kept having success and uh and then from

166
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Cornell I got into the Yale School of Forestry and Environment which is another not today

167
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
It's it's much more a

168
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,440
A breeding ground for environmental activists and policy people

169
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,639
So it's fully transition and then I went to Cal Berkeley after that, which is you know similar

170
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,560
And so I kept getting into these very challenging very great academic environments that were even more and more

171
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,759
Environmentally as well as scientifically

172
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,799
And the players on the world seen

173
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,480
How did you arrive at forest science is something you wanted to focus on from biology and guessing biology

174
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
Sort of an entry to you developing a scientific foundation

175
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,960
But then you focused your perspective a little bit from there. Yeah, that's a really interesting question

176
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,399
I think it was the fusion of backpacking and being out in the environment

177
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,320
I also remember when I was I think 17 I hitchhiked out from the east coast to the west coast and I was in Oregon

178
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
just as a long-haired kid by myself and I remember getting a a

179
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,560
A ride with a logger. I was up in the Oregon cascade somewhere near Salem

180
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,159
Not really knowing what I was doing

181
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,120
This is in May and I thought I was going to back that the pacifist crest to start back packing it those all under snow

182
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,759
And you know, I just didn't really know what I was doing

183
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
But I had this conversation with this logger

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,159
And I sort of told them about all the things I've read from the Sierra Club that helped bad

185
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,279
Fower forest we was in the northwest and how a clear cut is a sin that should never happen

186
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,039
And he just said now some let me tell you what we do it

187
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,879
Let me tell you what the safeguards are and I had no idea how one sided and biased a perspective

188
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,799
I was getting for from the Sierra Club

189
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:13,439
And that issue actually continues to this day as I worked in biotechnology where

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,199
you have

191
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,399
Organizations that I trusted as being truthful and telling the whole story. I'm not realize do not

192
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,240
And so that's that's one of the steps in my evolution from

193
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,159
Save the world simple scientist science will save the world to the real politics and real information society

194
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,159
We're in of course which has exploded of late with all the fake news and everything

195
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,959
But that's been going on forever to one degree or another just not a

196
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:39,600
Presidential level or quite so blatantly

197
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,639
But anyway that really opened my eyes got me interested. So what is really happening in forestry

198
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,199
And why do you clear? Okay, and we can be do it safely and can you use intensive technologies of all sorts

199
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
You know conscientiously and responsibly

200
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,440
Amidst all the noise and so that's a place that I continued to sort of work in for 30 years at OSU in the in the biotech

201
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,039
Controversy area later to true using agriculture in general

202
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Back to Yale. Okay fest today. It was surprised to find out that they had a forest science program

203
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,639
Yeah, yeah most people don't know about it. Yeah, tell me about that environment from you for you

204
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,680
Yeah, you know, Yale was a I went there I

205
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,320
First because when I was a Cornell and I was interning to undergraduate research with a ecologist

206
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,400
And he was grooming me to go work with his PhD supervisor

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,240
brilliant man named herb Mormon an ecosystem biologist

208
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,080
And I was all set to go there and then my graduation was in delayed a year because I

209
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,320
I overlooked a requirement in my visor and so I had one so one more year to kind of figure out who I was

210
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,879
And I took a class in forestry and I just got a little more interested in sort of application and the near-term sense

211
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
And so when I got to Yale

212
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,840
To work to be an ecosystem ecologist in a train I work with her but I did work with her boyman son

213
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,200
But I I sort of veered off and became more of a

214
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,200
Physiologist practitioner as compared to an ecosystem ecologist

215
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,240
But I also discovered that Yale was a place where the number of sort of scientists

216
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,600
Particularly the number of practice you know practitioner type scientists is very small

217
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,520
I mean it had really transitioned 60s and 70s into a training ground for

218
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,240
Environmental activists environmental lawyers

219
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:40,400
You know a lot of the people who populate a lot of international organizations come through places like Yale and Duke forestry is done

220
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,639
Similar thing and Cal Berkeley forestry's done a similar thing where it really to

221
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
To survive and be a

222
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,199
College in those institutions that are not land grants

223
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,639
Or if they are there, you know, they're mostly not in Berkeley's case. They're kind of a split one

224
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,679
They really had to become really working on big issues of environmental science and a global sense

225
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,000
So they transitioned and there's still some science there in all these places, but it's relatively small

226
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,320
Or it's highly environmental and so it's you know and Oregon state still we have we have a lot of that too

227
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
But we also have a much bigger because we serve we're in this region with this incredible forestry sector

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,519
Whereas New Haven is not in such a region anymore

229
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,480
It's a little bit of forestry but very very little by comparison and so we here try to serve both

230
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:35,759
You know training students just to work in the industry work in the land management agencies very actively

231
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
As well as do science and be in the cutting edge of the environmental issues

232
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,080
So anyway, but being at Yale was very much a step into that world

233
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,559
Which is world I wanted to be in my whole life

234
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,279
But I also realized that I was a little naive maybe in thinking that science had more of the answers

235
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,120
And in reality, I found that science has a lot of answers, but mostly

236
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,360
The laws and social perceptions make it difficult to have those answers sort of be used

237
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,880
Particularly in genetics, which you know we can talk about at some point

238
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,680
Yeah, what was your research focus at that point?

239
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
Yeah, so at at Yale I did

240
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,440
I think two or three projects there were also Yale doesn't have a master's

241
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,519
thesis requirement

242
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,319
So I got involved in research projects. I went out to the US Forest Service in California

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,200
In Berkeley actually where they had the Pacific Southwest station their work with scientists there

244
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
And got my first paper was on the inheritance

245
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,279
So pines have these turquinoids that make them smell sonitis in the resin that comes down and tries to protect them from barked

246
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,799
Beasons and so forth. Well the chemistry of that rate that resin varies widely

247
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,319
And so sometimes you have one chemical sometimes another and it's important to the ecology and the organism

248
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
So I figured out how it's inherited

249
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,080
Some scientists before me Bill Critchfield a very, very great man had made these hybrids between different species

250
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:01,839
And the progeny then had high alpha pining, low alpha pining, and we're seeing all these chemicals

251
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So he sort of did this basic

252
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,759
Meaning were crossing species with different chemistries that and then you could map the genes in the progeny

253
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,720
So he basically said here's the progeny you want to map the genes

254
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,960
And so I went out and measured them you know with help of the scientists and that was my first paper

255
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,559
And then there are a couple of other small projects like that

256
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,119
So really what it was very much being an apprentice in sciences like that a lot

257
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,320
Where you know people do projects over many years and then students and postdocs come in

258
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
And sort of figure it out at value to it tweak it

259
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,760
And particularly with trees but you know science in general or you know experiments take years to decades

260
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,320
And so I came into the stream of science that the farest science the farest service scientists were doing in Berkeley

261
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,840
I was able to publish in papers and that sort of set me up for

262
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,039
You know getting into grad school and in talent and success from there on was that your first exposure to tree genetics

263
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,039
I mean it's obviously yeah really and I yeah when I went to yellow was not as I told you it was to be an ecosystem scientist

264
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,759
And I started working for a geneticist there that put me on a couple of projects

265
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:15,279
And then he set up this opportunity with a far service in Berkeley, California name is Tom Lettig

266
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,720
He passed away from cancer a couple of years ago, but very very very well known internationally

267
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
And so

268
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,279
He and he was at Yale and then he moved to the farest service and so they set up those opportunities

269
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,519
So I went to Yale, you know, no particular interest in genetics

270
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,960
I was open to it and then the opportunities the people and then I went to Berkeley too, you know

271
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,319
That was partly to work with Tom Lettig, but I still was open to being a physiologist a

272
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,359
Siliculturist managing forests and a larger scale

273
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,039
Made in a college just even of some kind and then again opportunities the farest service there

274
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
Also one other theme in all this is one one thing that's frustrating me about ecology

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,279
And it still does a lot is it's hard to measure things precisely

276
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,319
you know, it's

277
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,839
And to somebody a lot of scientists they want to get to the bottom of things

278
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,919
They don't want to have a conclusion that says well, maybe this can be that can be this

279
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,400
We have data we have models, you know works this way, and that's just a nature of the beast

280
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,160
And in genetics you tend to get much closer to hard answers

281
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
And that was that was appealing to me

282
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,519
And then all the genetic technology that was coming along continues to just you know

283
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,840
my whole career

284
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,480
The field of genetics is exploded five times

285
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,200
Was attractive, you know, first it was enzymes and first it was turquinoids

286
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,240
And the chemistry thereof and the gas chromatographs

287
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
And that was these enzymes you were doing to look at genetic variation in a way that we never did

288
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,960
And then it was DNA and then it was genomics

289
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,440
So doing DNA on a massive scale

290
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
And then genetic engineering

291
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
So it's been this progression of incredibly powerful

292
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,319
And intellectually exciting and potentially very important technologies

293
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,440
So that's also pulled me out of ecology some

294
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,240
These technologies have been used in ecology quite a lot

295
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,839
But it's taken a long time to get there

296
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,920
Sounds like it was a fairly seamless transition to Berkeley for you

297
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,279
Well yeah, you know, I'd been there before and you know, I knew the place

298
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,279
And I loved it, you know, I just loved being in Berkeley

299
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,640
Those five years I was there

300
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,279
It was a great environment for a young person

301
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,880
And it's definitely a very

302
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,519
Artificial environment

303
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,799
And the reason I say that as one of my memories from there is

304
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,640
I think the first year we were there

305
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,319
This would be 1980

306
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,799
I hope I have the story right

307
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,759
Reagan was running against

308
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,279
I think it was Jimmy Carter

309
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,920
Maybe for Carter's second term or something like that

310
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,519
And he could be in Berkeley and think that Carter was a shoe in

311
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,960
And of course, I think you won no state but Massachusetts or something like that

312
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,799
And, you know, so again, you're in this little bubble of Berkeley

313
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,400
And you know, everything's very progressive

314
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,319
You know, realize where the country's at

315
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,720
And it's kind of sad to start a little bit this last election

316
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,480
Yeah

317
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,920
Tell me a bit more about this time I you progressed through your PhD years

318
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,160
Yeah, the PhD in Berkeley was really a good for me

319
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,480
I really enjoyed Cal Berkeley a lot

320
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
It had a lot of sort of what I was mentioning about

321
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Yeah, the environmental stuff, the foam and the science

322
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
And also a lot still a lot of the traditional stuff

323
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Some of the older economists and civil culture

324
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
It's very, very famous

325
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,759
People, Hank Fox, John Zavnuska

326
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,279
My main mentor at Berkeley, Bill Libby

327
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,800
Very charismatic guy

328
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
Very much

329
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Really in the mold that I've taken on a micro

330
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,359
I've kind of been a

331
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,839
spokesperson, if you will, for the use of genetic engineering

332
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,839
as a technology in forestry

333
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,119
Which is a difficult thing

334
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,200
And it's difficult, biologically, it's difficult

335
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
Socially, a lot of the incredible power of environmental groups

336
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,920
around the world that's exploded during my life

337
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,839
They're almost all opposed to either unilateral or extremely negative

338
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,680
So, Bill was kind of

339
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,599
He was a proponent of cloning in forestry

340
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
So, you know, you got to a wild forest

341
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
Now, every tree is a unique genotype

342
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
Like humans mostly are

343
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,240
With the exception of the occasional identical swim

344
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,280
And he said, well, what if you could pick the very most productive one

345
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
Out of this mass of variation

346
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
You know, not just one

347
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,600
But the top 10, the top 100 for production purposes

348
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,800
For wild forests, you'll maintain all the diversity you possibly can

349
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
But for production forests

350
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,320
If we could clone it, the benefits would be

351
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
Cloned them, the benefits would be huge

352
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,640
And so he argued that his whole career

353
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
And had some success, I mean, some of it was used

354
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,400
But he was very much pushing against the tide at that point

355
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
So the industry was very traditional

356
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
And then the environmental tide as well

357
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,599
So, I've said in a sense, following in its footsteps

358
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,960
Which is interesting, you know

359
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
Being a good biologist, I think

360
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,599
But being also outspoken on some of these policy issues

361
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:05,279
And using sort of innovative, new, socially novel genetic technology

362
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,160
Me and the GMO area, and then the cloning area

363
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,039
So anyway, you know, he was a very outspoken guy

364
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
And so he was very influential to me

365
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,879
But the whole, the whole intellectual environment of Berkeley

366
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:20,000
Was very stimulating

367
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,240
I T-8 in forest policy

368
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,960
So, you know, as a young scientist, I would say

369
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,639
Have a limited notion of how policies are made

370
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,639
And how laws are passed, and what they mean

371
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
They just figure, you know, you learn how it works in nature

372
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,560
And then, you do it smarter and better

373
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,240
And the notion that there's all these layers of rules and regs

374
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,160
And perceptions, invested interests

375
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,520
You know, we're just kind of naive

376
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,880
I mean, it's just that simple

377
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,800
And so, being at Berkeley was a time

378
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Where I really sort of got my eyes opened up

379
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,520
You know, taking and teaching about forest policy

380
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
Just, you know, I realize that

381
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,840
You know, scientists really want to change the world

382
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
They really need to be out there

383
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,000
They can't be naive in their labs

384
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,799
In their little fields

385
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,960
I think they have to be out there interacting with society

386
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,840
And, you know, I think I've done some of that

387
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,600
Not as much as some of my colleagues

388
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
But, you know, and I think today

389
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
You see a lot of activity on campuses

390
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
And that scientists need to do it even more

391
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,559
We have this March on Science

392
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,080
March 4 science coming up

393
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,759
In April and I think it's science to say

394
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,640
You know, it's just not going to be okay to be quiet

395
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,319
You have to get out there

396
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,119
And, but speaking for science is also

397
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,319
I'm rambling here a bit

398
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,559
But speaking for science is also really complicated

399
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
The scientists are all biased and ideological

400
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,919
Like everybody else

401
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,919
So, it's a really messy thing

402
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,639
Your dissertation was on storage next size, that correct?

403
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:47,279
It was, yeah

404
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
It was back in those days

405
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,599
They had these enzyme technologies

406
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,439
Called isosigns or allosigns

407
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,639
So, it turns out that

408
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:57,200
You know, you have thousands of proteins in your body

409
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,559
Trees due to

410
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,160
And due to genetic variation

411
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,400
The forms of those proteins vary

412
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,799
They just do what they do

413
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,319
But they do it a little bit differently

414
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,120
And so, back in the 60s, 70s, 80s

415
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,039
Scientists realize that instead of

416
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,480
Measuring genetic variation

417
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,279
See, based on variation and height

418
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
Of people like ourselves

419
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,559
That are influenced by the environment

420
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,559
How you have will you

421
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,960
As well as your DNA

422
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,319
You could look right at

423
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,240
The products of DNA in these proteins

424
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,559
We weren't able to look at DNA in self yet

425
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
So, that whole allosign

426
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
Genetic diversity

427
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
Technology was very, very big for 30 years

428
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,279
And that's my thesis

429
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,240
It was about trying to see

430
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
If you could look at the amount of

431
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,919
Genetic polymorphism

432
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,000
Variability in these enzymes

433
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,799
And trees, and could you predict their productivity

434
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,439
Are trees that have a greater diversity of enzymes

435
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,679
Are they more productive and a natural environment

436
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,759
Using the materials that are available to me

437
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,680
That was the question that I tried to answer

438
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,200
And I had some success

439
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,680
In the sense that I got some publications out about it

440
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
In good journals

441
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,000
But by no means that I resolve it at that level

442
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
And I have that question actually

443
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,039
Bigger question in science

444
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
Still continues

445
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,080
So, you finished up at Cal in 1985

446
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,960
And then you

447
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,120
Variety OSU, how did that come about

448
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,320
Yeah, that was an amazing thing

449
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,920
So, I did this thesis

450
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,240
That was really about genetic polymorphism

451
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,640
Whether it predicts productivity

452
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,720
And environmental stress tolerance

453
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,559
Was another element of it

454
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,559
And it had experimental plantations

455
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,039
But it wasn't really about production

456
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,200
It wasn't about biotechnology

457
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,160
By any, in any means

458
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,920
That wasn't called biotechnology

459
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,720
We didn't have that word really back then

460
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,000
And back at the time

461
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,759
In the 80s when I was at Cal

462
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,759
The field of biotech, what came to be called biotechnology

463
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,279
So, recombinant DNA

464
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,279
Cutting and splicing genes

465
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,640
Was starting

466
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,359
It had started in bacteria a few years earlier

467
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,000
And scientists were beginning to use its study diseases

468
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,359
The study cancer

469
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,720
To study human pathogens of various sorts

470
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,359
And then it started percolating into plants

471
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,680
Where people use it, we're using it the same way

472
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
And then scientists figured out

473
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,119
How they could transfer genes from one organism to another

474
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
So they could do sort of what people have done in bacteria years earlier

475
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,400
They could now do an implant

476
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,960
So the possibility of genetic engineering plants

477
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
For enhanced traits, suddenly was there

478
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,040
And everybody was talking about it

479
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,840
And I remember I think it was 84

480
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,440
A year before I graduated

481
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
My mentor, Tom Lettingley

482
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
I mentioned from Yale, it went to Berkeley

483
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,920
Health of big conference

484
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,280
How should we be using biotechnologies and forestry

485
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,279
What are the opportunities, what are the constraints

486
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,240
And I'm watching this

487
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,839
And I'm not a biotechnologist

488
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,720
I didn't really know what DNA was per se

489
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
Apart from

490
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,160
And suddenly it's like this is the next big thing

491
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,359
It's coming at us

492
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,079
And then the year 84, 85, depending on exactly how you dated

493
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,039
The first genetic engineer plant was created

494
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,680
And then two years later, the first genetic engineer tree up offer tree

495
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,279
That I've actually continued to work on

496
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,680
Most of them, my career was created

497
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,279
And the forest service was working on it

498
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,120
Just seemed like this is just a big, a big wonderful thing

499
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
And a big scientific technological challenge

500
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,600
And so I remember when this job came open at Oregon State

501
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,320
I was, you know, somewhere around December or so of 84

502
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Maybe January of 85

503
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,519
And I remember seeing it, someone pointed out to me

504
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,920
The, you know, so we've always had Oregon State

505
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,560
We've always had really strong forest genetics

506
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:45,200
It was a sub-discipline of forest science

507
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,559
And we've been strong in, at OSU, we've been strong in the forest service

508
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,319
Right across the parking lot

509
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,240
And so we had a geneticist, Kim Chang

510
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,759
Who was retiring

511
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,599
And so they said, well, what should we do?

512
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,440
Should we hire another Kim Chang?

513
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,119
Kim worked on psychology

514
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,359
Meaning, chromosome level

515
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,839
Genetic biology of trees, Douglas Farr

516
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,519
Or should we start going down deeper?

517
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,879
Just go down to the DNA level

518
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:10,159
That's where the science is going

519
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,800
And it's all this, all this foaming going on

520
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,880
And so we said, we're gonna, we're gonna take a risk and hire a biotechnologist

521
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
And I don't think any of the forestry school had done so yet

522
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,880
But about that time there were two or three that did it

523
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
So I don't remember if it was us

524
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,519
Or it was C-State

525
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,720
Or who was actually number one

526
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
But we were right there

527
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,920
Instead of taking this risk really

528
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
To invest in this new area

529
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,200
And so at that point there

530
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,960
There were not a cadre of forest biotechnology

531
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,880
PhDs and postdocs around

532
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,480
Because the field didn't exist

533
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,440
There were a couple

534
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,519
Just starting who had done work and

535
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,120
You know other species

536
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
Barley a colleague of mine, Dave Neil

537
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
And I know what you grabbed, very great scientist

538
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,960
Had done a postdoc and barley

539
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
Learning some of that stuff

540
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,519
But it wasn't trees

541
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,559
These were some of my competitors and for this job

542
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,039
Anyway, so I asked my mentors

543
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,440
I just said, you know, what's with this biotechnology thing

544
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
Is this like flash in the pan?

545
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,319
Is it, you know

546
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,600
Should I apply for this job?

547
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I don't have back, and I said, yeah, you should apply for it

548
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,640
You know, yours

549
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,000
Yours qualified as anybody

550
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,840
Get in how young this field is

551
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,640
And then I did

552
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,160
I went on this crash course

553
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Of learning about biotechnology

554
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
And so I

555
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,360
You know, I applied

556
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,040
And they basically hired me

557
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,560
On the notion that I had

558
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,040
You know, potential to grow with the field

559
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,000
And you know, I didn't say

560
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,840
I just like that turned out to be a pretty good

561
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,120
Pretty good guess

562
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
And so that's how it started

563
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I really, this is really a new venture for me

564
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,640
Is a new venture for

565
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
Forestry and OSU

566
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
And you know, it's had a number of turns

567
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,000
That no one predicted

568
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,320
But it's from the science point of view

569
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,320
From a career

570
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,280
Developmental point of view

571
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
It's, you know, been very successful

572
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,440
Yeah, sounds like a nice piece of

573
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,120
Strategic thinking or visionary thinking

574
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,920
I think so

575
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah, I think they knew they were doing that

576
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
They didn't really know where it was going to go

577
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,840
And I got here

578
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,600
You know, and I said, so what do you want me to do?

579
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,560
I said, I don't know

580
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,759
Well, what's biotechnology?

581
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,040
Figure it out

582
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,520
And do it

583
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,759
And actually the first five, seven years

584
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,080
I realized that genetic engineering was not really

585
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,280
You know, it had been done once

586
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
In one place

587
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,520
A tree was engineered

588
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,280
But it wasn't ready to go

589
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,560
So what can I do

590
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,400
And what I realized I could do

591
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,920
And I was also very successful

592
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,360
And made a name for myself

593
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,960
For early was I could

594
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,640
Use these DNA techniques

595
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,759
To figure out

596
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,400
The evolution of some of our major tree species

597
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
I think I had the most important paper

598
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
At that time

599
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,640
On pines and how they evolved

600
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,080
I had the most important paper

601
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,679
At that time, on Douglass Fur

602
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,439
And it's relatives and where it came from

603
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:41,199
And relationship to all its relatives

604
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,279
Around the Pacific, where I'm in the on

605
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,960
So there's a lot of insights that

606
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,639
You know, when you get to the DNA level

607
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,359
When you get an insight about

608
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,039
Relationships and evolution

609
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,960
They're often very, very strong

610
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
This is this thing, this precision

611
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,319
You get when you sequence

612
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,839
Or analyze DNA into that level

613
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,480
Suddenly people say, well, it's not just his opinion

614
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,559
About whether the size of the cones

615
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,519
Or the thickness of the barks

616
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,039
And the most important trait

617
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,599
It's this, you know, sort of random look at the DNA

618
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,879
And it just shouts at you

619
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,519
Which trees are most related to which

620
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,119
And who the common ancestor is

621
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,319
And so

622
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,240
What I did the first five or seven years

623
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,200
I did a lot of this genetic evolutionary analysis

624
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,519
Disappear really high quality science

625
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,639
And the people at OSU

626
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:23,359
Even though

627
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,359
My dean department had what a love to see me

628
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:25,920
Like

629
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,000
Help the forest industry right then

630
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
And they said, this is the right thing to be doing right now

631
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,159
And so was, you know

632
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,639
They did have a very open mind about it

633
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,080
But then eventually

634
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,440
And perhaps not getting ahead of myself

635
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,400
But I'll mention briefly

636
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,560
What happened in Oregon and in Northwest

637
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,800
Is people started worrying about sources of wood and pulp

638
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,360
Because we had the spotted allowars

639
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,840
We had rising environmentalism

640
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,480
And people were afraid there wouldn't be enough wood

641
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,680
So they started investing

642
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
And the Department of Energy made major investments

643
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,240
And growing these popular trees and plantations

644
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,160
Like the ones along I-84

645
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,160
That we talked about

646
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,440
Now those are products of that

647
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,759
And so people started doing series for search

648
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,480
And that was a big project at University of Washington on that

649
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,519
And I realized that I had the expertise

650
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,720
That was developed to add a genetic engineering element to it

651
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,119
And that started early 90s, late 80s, early 90s

652
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
And I started working with the industries

653
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,440
And developed an industry cooperative

654
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,280
Consortium basically a public-private partnership

655
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,200
And our college of forestry has a bunch of those

656
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,320
And still does

657
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,760
Where they provide money

658
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,559
Not a lot of money

659
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,880
But enough to sort of help guide it toward things of interest to them

660
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,480
And then we at the University

661
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,440
So use our resources and go out and go grant dollars

662
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,360
To sort of make good science of relevance happen

663
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,079
And working in poplars

664
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,960
I mentioned the first tree that was engineered was a poplar

665
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,039
Suddenly people are thinking about growing poplars

666
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,519
On a major scale in Oregon and in the Northwest

667
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
Let's use this technology to do it even better

668
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
And so a lot of my career has been

669
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,880
Instead of I took that step

670
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
For this consortium started working in poplars and genetic engineering

671
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,880
And I quickly got involved also in some of the social and legal issues of it

672
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,240
Like I said earlier, those are big

673
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
And they continue to be big

674
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,880
So that was the reason I made that shift early in my career at OSU

675
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,760
Into the genetic engineering per se

676
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,320
And also helping to deal with the social elements

677
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,679
Working with industries, forest industries, biotech industries

678
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,880
And so that's been kind of the big middle

679
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
of my career and in some continues

680
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,720
What is it about poplars that make most attractive to this work?

681
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,480
You know, they're much better from a science point of view

682
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,639
They're much better model organisms

683
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,559
So everything about Douglas Fur and Pine, you can imagine

684
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,599
When it comes to doing genetic manipulation is hard

685
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,200
I was terpenized, I mentioned early, well, they mess up

686
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,840
You're getting your DNA out of analyzing it

687
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,079
People have sort of got it got over it these days

688
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,079
But it's just one other thing

689
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,599
The genomes are huge

690
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:05,199
In poplars, we figured out pretty early on

691
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,000
In fact, the number one tree, how to insert a gene

692
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,199
Or modify a gene and then grow the progeny

693
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,199
And see how that one gene affects them

694
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,519
And in the conifer, that's still incredibly difficult to do

695
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,119
Very expensive and very difficult

696
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,199
So something about them makes them easier to engineer

697
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,759
They're genomes are small, they grow faster

698
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,440
It's very powerful in genetics

699
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,039
When you make a genetic change

700
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,119
Or you have a genetic variant of interest

701
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:32,960
To make copies of it

702
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,800
Just for replication

703
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
So you have high quality science

704
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,079
Poplars in nature

705
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,320
Cognum cells all the time

706
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,480
That's you know, these astins

707
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
You may have read about these grows of astins

708
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,159
There are kinds of poplars can cover

709
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,079
Many many acres in one single genotype

710
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,759
That doesn't happen much in conifers

711
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,119
So they're easy to make copies of

712
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,639
So there's a bunch of reasons

713
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:57,360
Easy to transform, small genome, easy to make copies of

714
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,559
Faster growing

715
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,559
That make them very good genetic models

716
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,400
And then also you know

717
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,280
The industry was already looking at making hybrids

718
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,640
Between different species to increase productivity

719
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,519
They were already cloning them for plantations

720
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,320
And so the genetics was very intense

721
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,519
And then adding genetic engineering

722
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,599
As another kind of genetics made sense

723
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,480
Because you go in

724
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
The industry already brought it in science

725
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,680
It's already brought it to this level

726
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,840
Let's take that level further

727
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,480
When you look at Douglas Ferr or

728
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,200
Or Pines

729
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,320
Even today

730
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
The genetics is primitive

731
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
You know, compared to any crop species

732
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,120
Compared to poplars

733
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,559
And so it's much higher to say

734
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,960
Genetic engineering is what we need to do now

735
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,800
We're still sort of in the neolithic

736
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,519
With breeding

737
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,120
So it doesn't make as much sense

738
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,559
The accomplish it does

739
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,600
So you have all these reasons

740
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,840
The biology as well as the state of breeding

741
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,039
And then also if you're making a particular product

742
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,400
With poplars like

743
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,160
Or particular kinds of wood or biofuels

744
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,079
You can optimize it much more

745
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,400
And that's how the industry came about

746
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,960
Whereas in the sort of generalized forestry

747
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,559
We're making all kinds of things

748
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,400
And there are all kinds of conditions

749
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,639
We don't control the environment as much as grown on it

750
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,760
You know, steep hillsides

751
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
And poppers

752
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,320
It's more agricultural

753
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,360
In fact, they're

754
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,039
Regulated as agricultural crops

755
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,559
By Oregon and Washington

756
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,760
And so everything about the social and biological environment

757
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,559
Made it

758
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,279
Sensible to consider trying to add

759
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:26,159
In genetic engineering as an exgenetic technology

760
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,559
Backing up just a hair

761
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm interested in collecting a little bit of institutional knowledge

762
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,320
Yeah

763
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
At the university and of the college

764
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
What do you remember about your early impressions

765
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,639
Of OSU and of the college of forestry

766
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,320
You know, the things that stand out over all these years

767
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,679
Dean Stoltenberg who hired me

768
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,279
And

769
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,199
Successor George Brown

770
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,919
Just this incredible sense of

771
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,879
You know, go out there and make an impact

772
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,919
Serve the state, serve the nation, serve

773
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:07,119
Just this incredible ethic of service

774
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,279
You know, I came out of

775
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:11,279
I came in here still somewhat young

776
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,039
Still very much wanting to do science

777
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,679
And wanting to survive also in academia

778
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,559
I was very nervous

779
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,239
You know, I'm going to be able to get tenure

780
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,079
And you know, and it's just

781
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,480
And they really wanted much more

782
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,400
They weren't interested so much

783
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,159
I'm going to survive and get my next grant

784
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,119
But what am I going to do to change the world for the better

785
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,840
Well, how am I going to

786
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,320
And also they had a sense of how am I going to serve

787
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,920
The Oregon industry better

788
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
And make Oregon more productive

789
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,960
And economically more vital

790
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
So I just felt that

791
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,599
I felt the pressure of it

792
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,920
But I also felt that it was wholesome and real

793
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,920
And good

794
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
And so that was another reason

795
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,159
For the transition to popular

796
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,159
As I mentioned, I did this

797
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,440
Genetic work early on

798
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,960
On the evolutionary relationships

799
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,920
At different species

800
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,559
That was a great way to use biotech methods

801
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,159
To advance science

802
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,559
But it wasn't really going to advance

803
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,559
Oregon far sure

804
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,800
And accepting a very fundamental level

805
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,039
And so when poplars came along

806
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,440
And in fact, I could use genetic engineering

807
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,880
I could do great science

808
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,039
And it can have an impact on the industry

809
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,320
And on society

810
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,680
Maybe tomorrow

811
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,519
If we can really grow trees

812
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,199
You know, 10-20% better by using genetic engineering methods

813
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,519
And we can do it in poplars in my lab

814
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,519
And get it out there

815
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,279
You know, that's exciting

816
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:29,279
That conjunction of application

817
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:31,599
And you know, one thing that we've worked on too for many years

818
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,759
That tied into my environmental background

819
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:36,159
Is, you know, it was pretty obvious to me

820
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,599
That

821
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,199
Genetic engineering trees

822
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,239
Poplars

823
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,239
We're going to be controversial for variety of reasons

824
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,799
We've already seen it in agriculture and medicine

825
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,120
And so it's not like society is going to just say

826
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,360
Rarararala, let's have more of it

827
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,039
They're going to say, I don't like this

828
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,720
Or they're going to say

829
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,080
Who controls it

830
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
And so on and so forth

831
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
And how should be regulated

832
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,080
What should the role of the EPA be

833
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,720
And should be really have very strict regulations

834
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,360
So you know, it was obvious to me that was all going to happen

835
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,480
And what's happening

836
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
And the biggest

837
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,600
Issue that science can deal with about that

838
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,440
Is

839
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,000
So release of propagules into natural environments

840
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
So I think cognitively you cross a line

841
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,280
When you say we're going to genetic engineer something

842
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,119
Then you're really saying that humans are really taking control of this organism

843
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,720
And changing it to their needs

844
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,639
Of course we do that with conventional breeding

845
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,079
I know all of our crops

846
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,200
Corn, whatever it is

847
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,240
Are looking at nothing like their wild relatives

848
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,559
And we've made that cognitive leap

849
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,000
But I think now we're even more

850
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,599
I'll conjure that than we used to be

851
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,039
Genetic engineering

852
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,880
Because it's an unnatural

853
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,320
Mostly unnatural technique

854
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,119
It does happen in nature but not commonly

855
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,039
You cross this cognitive line

856
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,840
Where it was obvious to me that people are not going to

857
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,159
Well people might say, well I'll accept

858
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,239
In these intensive popular plantations

859
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,400
That look nothing like a natural

860
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,039
That genetic engineering can have a place

861
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,519
But I don't want the pollen and seeds spreading out into wild riparian

862
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,880
Cottonwood areas

863
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,440
Where really what we value is biodiversity

864
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
And all the ecosystem functions

865
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
That's going to be a problem

866
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,719
And indeed it is

867
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,719
So we said you know so we need to

868
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,239
For those plantations trees

869
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,239
We need to shut down flower

870
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
We think trees grow faster as a result

871
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,360
But the main thing is that

872
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,280
Even though poppers do vegetative

873
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,400
We spread a little bit

874
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
We can manage that

875
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,079
But we can't manage pollen

876
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,960
Floating miles and miles in there

877
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,679
And so another exciting thing was

878
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,920
In addition to developing the gene transfer methods

879
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
And working with industries to test things

880
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,960
We said we're going to develop the genetic containment technology

881
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
So society accepts it

882
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,760
I mean we continue to make that our focus all these years

883
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,599
And that really tied into my sort of environmental consciousness coming in

884
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
Let's use advanced technology but let's do it right

885
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,480
And so that's probably what I'm most known for around the world

886
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,800
Is developing this containment technology

887
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,639
And putting it into practice

888
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,079
To take a long time

889
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,319
You know the science takes a while

890
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,279
Getting the genes in

891
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:13,119
And then if you're studying flowering

892
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,079
You have to wait years

893
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,159
Because trees don't flower right away

894
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,039
So what really is

895
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,719
I didn't realize there's so much at the time

896
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,799
When I made that decision in the early 90s

897
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,279
I was committing to two or three decades of

898
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:24,960
Experiments and that's what's happened

899
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,839
You know, there's still going on

900
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,079
There's still on the field outside for balance

901
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,559
At what point did you start to receive some pushback

902
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,199
From various outside entities

903
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Pretty much from the get-go

904
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,760
You know in the beginning there really has been

905
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,960
And I don't know if anybody's measured it

906
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,160
I'm sure actually that's what they haven't

907
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,040
I should probably go find the papers

908
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,080
What they've done

909
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,000
But I used to mock some of the media coverage

910
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,240
And including OSU's own public relations

911
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,400
That here's biotechnology

912
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,000
It's the answer to all our problems

913
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,160
It's going to feed the world

914
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,320
It's going to revolutionize

915
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,920
We're going to make square trees

916
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,680
That you know, just go right into the boards

917
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,320
You know, it's all this crazy stuff

918
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,920
That I knew was not going to have

919
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
That I'm not going to happen in my lifetime

920
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,120
So it was hyped

921
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,320
And society kind of, that's where they were sort of giddy about it

922
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,519
And then over, I think it was the late 90s

923
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:24,720
When various things happened

924
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
In agricultural biotechnology

925
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,480
Where then the media coverage became pretty negative

926
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,320
And big environmental groups

927
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,519
Like green peas with hundreds of millions of dollars of funds

928
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,840
Essentially environmental corporations

929
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
Decided they were against all of it everywhere

930
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:42,800
Whether you were making, you know,

931
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,600
Or fight them in aid to deal with blindness

932
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,559
Whether you're trying to make tree

933
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,440
They were against all of it

934
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,960
It was an ideological thing

935
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,880
And so probably because organizations like that

936
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,280
With a lot of power and money changed

937
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,840
Things shifted

938
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Things became much more negative

939
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,559
And then in the, again, in the later 90s

940
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,240
When you started to see a lot of vandalism

941
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,280
First in agricultural biotechnology

942
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,480
Then in forestry

943
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,200
And so in 2001 was a big year

944
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,680
Here at Oregon State in Corvallis

945
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,640
We had vandalism

946
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,720
Somebody came in during the middle of the night

947
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,680
In Corvallis

948
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,200
And cut through a wire fence

949
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,720
And damaged it at a thousand trees

950
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,000
It was at night

951
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,920
And you can't tell the ones that are genetically

952
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,120
And engineering for ones that aren't

953
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,920
So most of them

954
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,000
They actually didn't get what they wanted to

955
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,679
But, you know, it was indication of just the intensity of the issue

956
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:34,880
That I think was in March

957
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,079
And then in June

958
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,679
There was arson

959
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,239
Against the collaborative of mine at the University of Washington

960
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,320
His building was almost completely burned down

961
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:44,320
Collaborating industry

962
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,159
And clats can I had a million dollars

963
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,000
And farm equipment damaged

964
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,199
So it really ramped up

965
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,400
And it really got intense

966
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,199
I was the chair of an international

967
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,199
Society for tree biotechnology

968
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,360
We were having a meeting in Oxford

969
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,560
In, I guess it was 1999

970
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,720
A couple of years earlier

971
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,080
And the one

972
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,400
The one field trial of the genetic engineering tree in England

973
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,360
Was vandalized

974
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,160
The evening of our international scientific conference

975
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,400
And so all these things

976
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,360
You know, told me that

977
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,160
Holy cow

978
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,400
Society's not with us

979
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,680
And then in Europe in particular

980
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,040
Which was sort of finally reacting against Lonsanto

981
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,400
And bringing in

982
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
You know, genetic engineering

983
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,039
Soybeans

984
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,639
As animal feed into the country

985
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,240
And blockating them and all that

986
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,039
When these trees were damaged

987
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
Outside of Oxford

988
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,559
The

989
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,079
And these trees were trees that had

990
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,960
Without going into the technical details

991
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,119
They were engineered to be easier to pulp

992
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,599
Meaning take less energy, less chemicals

993
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,200
To produce the same amount of pulp

994
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,119
So it's something that we have thought of scientists

995
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,320
The environmentalists were going to love

996
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:54,480
And that we have strong support for

997
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,440
But no

998
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,199
The bigger narrative in society really dominated that

999
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:00,800
So when these trees were destroyed

1000
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,599
The science about what we were doing was irrelevant

1001
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,400
And the

1002
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,000
The storyline and the major media

1003
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,880
The Guardian and others

1004
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,559
Was Monsanto now

1005
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:11,599
You know, they're wreak havoc

1006
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,400
And the foods apply

1007
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,240
And now they're going to wreak havoc and are forest

1008
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,119
And we are all like holy cow

1009
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,639
Well, you know, what are these guys?

1010
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:19,599
Smoking

1011
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,039
But you know, that's how big

1012
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:21,920
Then the

1013
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,599
Social narrative

1014
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,400
Is about genetic engineering and GMOs

1015
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,279
The details of the science really don't matter much

1016
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:31,920
And that's a hard thing to remember

1017
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,440
But anyway, so, you know, 1999-2001

1018
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,759
Also in 2001, we had 9-11 in the United States

1019
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:43,360
And the government called eco-terrorist terrorists

1020
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,239
And they pursued them the same way as they pursued people

1021
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,400
Who are bombing the World Trade Center

1022
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,159
And so that kind of stuff stopped

1023
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,519
The guys who did the stuff in Oregon and Washington

1024
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:55,839
Were mostly cotton, but in jail

1025
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,839
And in Europe, they continued

1026
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,920
In the US, it stopped

1027
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,839
But that was, you know, a big marker

1028
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,000
That things were just crazy out of hand

1029
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,839
But society's reaction continued to ramp up after that

1030
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,319
And, you know, one of the conditions we have today

1031
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,159
Is that Greenpeace and others who are very against this stuff

1032
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,199
Have created conditions

1033
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:17,679
Where forest industries really can't use genetic engineering

1034
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,279
Very

1035
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:22,000
The their own certification organizations

1036
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:23,679
Don't allow it

1037
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:25,039
Even in research

1038
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,480
So the field trials, the collaborative work I dealt with industry years ago

1039
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,440
Doesn't happen anymore

1040
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,039
Because, or happens outside of

1041
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,039
The Northwest in very special conditions

1042
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,679
Because the social conditions have become so hostile

1043
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,239
You know, just like you

1044
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:42,000
Just like in organic food

1045
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,079
You can't have any GMO in it no matter what

1046
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:46,399
Even though scientists will say

1047
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,079
There's good uses of it

1048
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,079
In addition to the ones that are questionable

1049
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,000
It's an all or nothing thing

1050
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,720
And that's where society's at with forestry uses right now

1051
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,599
And one of the things I've done in my career is try to argue that

1052
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,119
We need research

1053
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,800
To find out what are the good uses

1054
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,000
What are the not so good uses

1055
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,720
How we can make

1056
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,519
And not so good use

1057
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,720
And make it good

1058
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,559
You know, and

1059
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,000
That kind of

1060
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,280
That's really not gone anywhere

1061
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,480
Even though I've tried

1062
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
To sort of

1063
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,400
What I would consider to have a more middle

1064
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,960
And more reasonable science-based agenda

1065
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,720
The environment for community

1066
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,760
The marketing

1067
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Arm of it in particular

1068
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,680
Feels like this is the way they have to be

1069
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,760
To get the consumers to buy their products

1070
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,360
To charge more for it

1071
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,920
And maybe do the right thing on their view

1072
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,119
So it's

1073
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,240
It's become a hostile world

1074
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,360
I'm really

1075
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,960
I'll be able to finish my career

1076
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,079
Using this technology

1077
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,599
But by and large

1078
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,440
In forestry around the world

1079
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,519
The amount of interest in genetic engineering

1080
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,800
As I'm death that is really gone

1081
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:44,240
It's not zero

1082
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,920
But it's really gone way down

1083
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,120
The social pushback

1084
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,080
It's been

1085
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,519
Bigger than anybody could have imagined

1086
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,760
So, how have you

1087
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
Been able to navigate that

1088
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,160
Or how have you

1089
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,680
Have an effort to adapt

1090
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,200
Or compromise

1091
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah

1092
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,160
You know, it's a reality

1093
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,640
And you know, it's important to recognize

1094
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,440
It's sort of a

1095
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,560
Twelve steps thing

1096
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,560
Recognize what you can change

1097
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,519
And once you can

1098
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,519
And so I, you know,

1099
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
I've written a bunch of papers about how

1100
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,079
What a smarter way would be

1101
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,039
To regulate

1102
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,480
What a smarter way to be

1103
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,119
To market it

1104
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,840
I had a paper in Science Magazine last year

1105
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,719
I've been able to publish

1106
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,759
In the very best journals

1107
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:24,960
Putting forward ideas of

1108
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,199
Collaborative lawyers and economists

1109
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,960
You know, to get the social stuff

1110
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,759
Right

1111
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,960
You know, being on

1112
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,400
I'm a biologist

1113
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,599
But, you know

1114
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,800
There's a larger

1115
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,679
Larger forces

1116
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,480
Larger social economic forces

1117
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,000
You know, big companies

1118
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,280
Profit from

1119
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,280
You know, avoiding GMOs

1120
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,480
They're not going to stop doing it

1121
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,280
You know, it's not

1122
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,800
Not just philosophical, it's a huge

1123
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,200
Profit margin to saying

1124
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,400
You're cleaner than now

1125
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,120
I mean, I call it greenwashing

1126
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,640
But it's everywhere in the marketplace

1127
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,400
Now, I can't buy a loaf of bread

1128
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,640
That I want without a no GMO seal

1129
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,920
Even though I'd like to avoid it

1130
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,040
Because I know it's meaningless

1131
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,600
So that's, you know, it's a bigger thing

1132
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,800
So what are you doing that, man?

1133
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,760
It's from my point of view

1134
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,000
You know, we had at OSU

1135
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,360
We had an outreach and biotechnology program

1136
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,599
Mainly funded to the College of Ag

1137
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,519
Probably funded through Forestry

1138
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,800
That I was the chair of

1139
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
The director of for about eight years

1140
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,280
It was kind of a soft program

1141
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,000
It used to be something that was a hard program

1142
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,719
An extension

1143
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,559
And instead of got softer over the years

1144
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,199
But we did it

1145
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,079
We had a website

1146
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,400
And we hosted 40 public lectures

1147
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,679
We got amazing scientists

1148
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:34,639
And all over the coming

1149
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:35,760
And talked to the public

1150
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,360
In Corralis about all these issues

1151
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,240
So that was one way that I thought

1152
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,640
I could sort of really help change society

1153
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,200
Or make society smarter about this

1154
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,360
And I think it was super successful

1155
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,280
But I think OSU

1156
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,519
The College of Agriculture has sort of tired

1157
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:54,880
Over this

1158
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,640
And there's only so much science can do

1159
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,000
And so they've sort of backed away

1160
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,120
They don't want to alienate

1161
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,640
They're more organic elements

1162
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,000
They're non-NKGMO

1163
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,000
And so most universities

1164
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Not all of them, but some large majority have said

1165
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,480
This is bigger than we can deal with

1166
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:12,400
Our state funds are being cut

1167
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,280
We'd rather have somebody use breeding berries

1168
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,679
Than nobody breeding berries

1169
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,599
And have somebody fighting this

1170
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,079
This way wave of anti-biotechnology

1171
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,199
Because it's very complicated

1172
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,679
It is, you know, if you do responsible outreach about it

1173
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,199
It's not just rar-ar-ah

1174
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,079
It's here is the trade-offs

1175
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,239
Here's the pros in the cons and the center

1176
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:34,960
So it's a complicated story

1177
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,720
So anyway, from my own point of view

1178
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,480
I've sort of fought

1179
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:41,199
Road scientific papers

1180
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,240
Talk to regulators

1181
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,720
I still get three or four or five talks a year

1182
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,639
I've talked at the public library

1183
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,440
And sound to the environmental educators

1184
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,840
Consortium up there a few weeks ago

1185
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,440
So I still do things occasionally

1186
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,440
But the basic I've said

1187
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,639
You know I could do research

1188
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,639
To advance the science and the technology

1189
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,280
And when society is ready

1190
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,119
If they're ever ready, it'll be there

1191
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,960
And so that's where I put 95% of my energies

1192
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,480
Is doing the science

1193
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,000
And it's hard, one thing

1194
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,359
Conditions are sufficiently adverse

1195
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,920
In both Europe and the United States

1196
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,880
For applied biotechnology in the public sector

1197
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,000
That it's very hard to go to a USDA

1198
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,239
Or department of energy, grandpa

1199
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,759
And say I have an idea

1200
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:28,000
For a better genetic engineer trade

1201
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,199
We're going to tweak this and that

1202
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,000
And then they're going to say

1203
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Well, it's a GMO right

1204
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,039
So it's going to be really hard to get regulatory approval

1205
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:37,360
Companies are going to have trouble growing it

1206
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,039
So we're not going to fund that

1207
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:41,440
And that's happened the last 15 years

1208
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,559
It's very hard

1209
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,599
But the one kind of funding

1210
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,360
You can still get a little bit of

1211
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,280
Is if you want to say

1212
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,920
Well, we need better safety technology

1213
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,360
We need to not worry so much about getting better trees

1214
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,119
But getting safer trees

1215
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,320
And so that's really that

1216
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,480
Middle niche has allowed me to

1217
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,360
To continue doing the research I do on genetic containment

1218
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,400
And so forth

1219
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,360
And so that's one of the ways

1220
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,559
I've been able to keep doing

1221
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,559
What I believe is interesting and important

1222
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,679
Getting the science done

1223
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:12,719
Testing it in the field

1224
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,240
To me it's very important

1225
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,159
Not just that I do laboratory work

1226
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:17,039
Because you need to go out

1227
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:18,159
Into a real-the-real world

1228
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,480
Most laboratory ideas don't actually work

1229
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,320
Because the world is complicated

1230
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,079
And so I have stuff out

1231
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,800
I have 10 acres growing in Carvalis now

1232
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
That are testing ideas from the field

1233
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,120
From the laboratory

1234
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,080
At any rate

1235
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,000
But it's this safety orientation

1236
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,440
That's allowed me to keep

1237
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,600
Productive, keep doing good science

1238
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,519
Even though the social

1239
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,440
Millio is extremely adverse

1240
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,920
And funding is very hard to get

1241
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,000
So the work on biode safety

1242
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,440
And the sterile nursery plants

1243
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,840
Has almost been a survival strategy in your point

1244
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,720
Exactly, yeah

1245
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,160
And it's survival

1246
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,600
But it's also something I said

1247
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,640
I'm interested in

1248
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,080
And when I started that construction

1249
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,760
Started working on poppers I said

1250
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,160
We need to figure out containment

1251
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,760
And so I'm still doing that

1252
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,840
And luckily that hasn't dried up

1253
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,440
You know

1254
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,440
You know, it could anytime

1255
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,640
But it hasn't so far

1256
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,480
And I do work that

1257
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,440
Is state of the art

1258
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,800
It's competitive

1259
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,040
Throughout science and throughout agriculture

1260
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,200
So these are the panel that funds this

1261
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,880
It's mainly a USDA panel

1262
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,560
Called biotechnology risk assessment

1263
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,320
That won the ARS

1264
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,200
Thing that you just mentioned

1265
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
Was a separate thing related to it

1266
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,600
But that's funding all of agriculture

1267
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,000
So we have to be doing work on trees

1268
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,799
That is competitive with the very best work in corn

1269
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:33,519
And that's hard

1270
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:34,719
Because they have a lot more money

1271
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:36,559
And there are a lot more advanced genetics

1272
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,159
But I'm proud that I've been able to do that

1273
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:40,079
I can compete with those guys

1274
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,559
Because the science we do is just as good

1275
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,920
If I didn't dug the store

1276
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,440
I probably couldn't

1277
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,639
But I can do it in public

1278
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,279
Something else for you

1279
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:49,679
Yeah

1280
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,440
That caught my was

1281
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,279
The project on carbon sequestration

1282
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:54,400
Using popper trees

1283
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:54,719
Yeah

1284
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:55,759
About that

1285
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:56,159
Yeah

1286
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:57,119
Well, you know

1287
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:58,879
You know, it's interesting

1288
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,079
It's a very

1289
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,079
If you decide you're going to grow trees

1290
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,759
Seriously for some purpose

1291
00:56:04,879 --> 00:56:07,440
Meaning they're going to have a dominant dedicated use

1292
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:10,399
What you what nature gives you

1293
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,639
Is okay

1294
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,079
And you can tweak it further

1295
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,079
But often you want something very different

1296
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:17,759
And so

1297
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:22,000
People do ecological modeling

1298
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,639
Started saying

1299
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,399
Well, you know, if we produced trees

1300
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:25,679
That had more roots

1301
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:27,679
And less stem

1302
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,920
Which is contrary to what people do in forestry

1303
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,399
They tend to want the fastest growing tallest tree

1304
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,119
I said no, maybe we don't want the tallest one

1305
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,399
Maybe we want the fattest one with lots of roots

1306
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,920
And the roots will add to the carbon and the soil

1307
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,119
And decay much slower

1308
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:47,440
And stem material would

1309
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,079
Maybe

1310
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,599
Maybe we can even make the roots

1311
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,199
So they decay more slowly

1312
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,199
Enhance the amount of

1313
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,640
Turpen lines and phonolics

1314
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,320
These compounds that slow down

1315
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,080
Decomposition so the carbon

1316
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,080
Stays around in the soil longer

1317
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,000
So it's those ideas that we could change

1318
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,720
The allocation between tops and bottoms

1319
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
And change the chemistry of roots

1320
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,960
That would promote carbon sequestration

1321
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,760
That was the idea

1322
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,680
We also thought

1323
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,440
If we had a tree that has more roots

1324
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,040
It'll survive great stresses

1325
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,680
It'll bioremediate soils better

1326
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,960
We also have a problem in industry

1327
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,320
That sometimes we can select the fastest growing trees

1328
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,079
And this has happened in the Northwest with Poplar

1329
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,280
As they blow down

1330
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,440
We get these giant windstorms every now and then

1331
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,320
And they just blow over

1332
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,440
And so

1333
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,079
And then also we have an agriculture

1334
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,599
The green revolution

1335
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Which is not a biotech GMO thing

1336
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,960
But it's a bunch of technologies

1337
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:43,760
Starting in about the 1960s

1338
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,320
The key one is a scientist figured out

1339
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,800
That we don't want taller wheat

1340
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,159
We don't want taller rice

1341
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,839
When you just select for productivity

1342
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:52,879
Everything gets taller

1343
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:54,879
And then when you have a storm

1344
00:57:54,879 --> 00:57:56,159
They blow over their lodge

1345
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,480
And you probably see this around Pendleton

1346
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:00,639
That happens occasionally

1347
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:02,239
And then the crop is lost at rots

1348
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,079
The quality is caused

1349
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,159
So what the scientists did is

1350
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:07,839
They found a dwarfism gene

1351
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,119
Semi-dwarfism

1352
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,719
That keeps the wheat instead of being

1353
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:11,599
In a way over your head

1354
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,879
It keeps it about here

1355
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:15,279
And mostly we see around Oregon is like that

1356
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:17,359
But that's a particular gene

1357
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,519
brought in from an Asian variety

1358
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,519
That constrains it from getting taller

1359
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,280
So it gets more root

1360
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,759
So it gets more seeds on it

1361
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:26,800
And it doesn't launch

1362
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,559
So it was also that thinking

1363
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,039
That maybe we can sequester more carbon

1364
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,400
Have a tree that's more drought taller

1365
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,840
And bioremediates better

1366
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,320
By having them be shorter

1367
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,000
And I'm not talking about three feet tall

1368
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,960
This is a tree

1369
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,159
So instead of 100 feet

1370
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:43,599
You might be 60 feet

1371
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:44,000
Whatever

1372
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,880
Between slow it down

1373
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,759
And change

1374
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:46,719
The distribution

1375
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:48,079
And the quality of the biomass

1376
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,559
And so that's what that project was about

1377
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,559
Trying to tweak these trees

1378
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,799
For these particular goals

1379
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,000
And we were successful at it

1380
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,799
We did, you know

1381
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,039
And some of the genes we tested were genes

1382
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,039
From the green revolution we

1383
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,319
And because the mechanisms

1384
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,279
Are very fundamental

1385
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:04,239
They work quite well

1386
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,119
And so we were able to get shorter trees

1387
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,319
With more roots

1388
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,119
And uh

1389
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,319
But was anybody going to use them?

1390
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:10,559
No

1391
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,519
Because they're a GMO

1392
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:12,480
And because they're

1393
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,159
It would change the industry

1394
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,360
Industry doesn't work that way

1395
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,599
Breeding would have to be radically different

1396
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,880
We'd have to get a GMO

1397
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,799
Probably into the breeding program

1398
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,079
Because one of the things you're doing

1399
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,119
Is your

1400
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,119
Creating trees that are smaller

1401
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,079
Can grow as fast

1402
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,880
While in nature

1403
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,279
Those trees die

1404
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:30,480
Right, because they can't get light

1405
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,319
So um

1406
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,599
You'd have to change

1407
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,199
The whole way you breed trees

1408
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:36,239
And evaluate them

1409
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:37,759
And anyway

1410
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:39,759
It would be very disruptive to the industry

1411
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:41,039
But with the GMO element

1412
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,480
Of it it was a non-starter

1413
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,360
So we did the work

1414
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,719
It was successful

1415
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:45,599
And you know

1416
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,480
There it is

1417
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,360
The science is done

1418
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,960
Does somebody ever want to pick it up?

1419
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,760
You know, I don't know

1420
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:50,960
Um

1421
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,800
But that's what that was about

1422
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,519
In short of it

1423
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:54,240
Yeah

1424
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,679
And that was a

1425
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:58,000
Project that had an association with Sungrant

1426
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,719
Is that correct?

1427
00:59:58,719 --> 00:59:59,199
That's right

1428
00:59:59,199 --> 00:59:59,679
Yeah

1429
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,800
That was a

1430
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,199
Department of Energy, USDA funded

1431
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,159
There was a couple of them

1432
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,320
The biggest funding we got

1433
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,360
Was from the

1434
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,320
Biofuels section of the Department of Energy

1435
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:10,960
That was a big

1436
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,760
And then we had some supplementary funding from other places

1437
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,840
We've also got funding from the Sungrant

1438
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,519
A couple other places

1439
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,360
On trying to make a tree

1440
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,559
That would have some

1441
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,320
Value-boat co-products

1442
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,559
So one of the problems with growing bioenergy

1443
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,039
Is that energy is cheap in the world

1444
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:28,960
Unless we tax fossil fuels

1445
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,920
Really aggressively

1446
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,720
Which we're not

1447
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,000
Almost anywhere

1448
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,320
As aggressively as it probably should be

1449
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,360
They're not competitive

1450
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,519
So how do you make them more competitive

1451
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:39,120
One of the ways is to engineer

1452
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,400
In some product

1453
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,760
That is high value

1454
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,120
A new biochemical

1455
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,760
That would be have some other higher use in industry

1456
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,360
So we've tried to get trees that produce bioplastics

1457
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,480
Things that you can use

1458
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,440
And we're already using the similar versions

1459
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,240
From bacteria

1460
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,560
Of these cops that decompose

1461
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,240
That you can put in the compost

1462
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,840
We tried to make the same kind of thing

1463
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,960
Of polymer trees

1464
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,520
And we did it

1465
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,760
But we couldn't make an after-make it economic

1466
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,840
So we really need a major engine

1467
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,600
Euring leap to make that work

1468
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,800
And so

1469
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,000
We're just no funding for it

1470
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,640
But you know

1471
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,480
But it's also a hard problem

1472
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,520
But that's what

1473
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,200
That's what one of the Sungrant projects

1474
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,000
Was about

1475
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,240
Was trying to figure out how to make those biofuels

1476
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,840
And we collaborated with companies

1477
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,440
That were doing it in different crops

1478
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,880
And it's a hard problem

1479
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,360
And we still

1480
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,160
I thought a student

1481
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,680
Who's sort of working on an element of it

1482
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,640
But it's

1483
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,680
It would require a pretty serious effort

1484
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,960
Yeah

1485
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,400
Has any of your work intersected

1486
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,160
With the cross-laminated

1487
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,840
Products at all?

1488
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,800
Only that the

1489
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,840
No, the short answers

1490
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,560
No

1491
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,760
I was at a conference

1492
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,560
The

1493
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,160
Panco Foundation

1494
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,120
Is this

1495
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,320
Forestry Foundation

1496
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,519
Funded by this

1497
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:48,240
I assume which guy who really wants to infuse

1498
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,240
Advanced engineering technology of all kinds

1499
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,840
To make better wood products

1500
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,320
Including the laminated products

1501
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,760
For Oregon and for the industry

1502
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,080
And he's

1503
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,240
You know why aren't we doing genetic engineering

1504
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,840
He's looking at all the amazing things

1505
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,800
In engineering

1506
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,120
You know

1507
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,480
In the traditional sense

1508
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,920
Why not genetic engineering

1509
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,440
And I went to this conference

1510
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,320
With other engineers

1511
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,280
And I told them

1512
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,960
It's the broader social element

1513
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,120
And it's also that the industry is not ready for it

1514
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,240
Because we're still

1515
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,480
Sort of in the Neolithic breeding wise

1516
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,320
And so it would just be like

1517
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,960
Trying to teach a baby to run before

1518
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,000
It's able to walk

1519
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,600
It just didn't make sense

1520
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,960
He didn't want to hear that

1521
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,800
But that's that's the reality of it

1522
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,760
You know so it could be done

1523
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,640
And you know if we

1524
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,240
But before we did that for example

1525
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,400
If you're going to have the precision of genetic engineering

1526
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,440
To try to

1527
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,040
Get the fibers to set up

1528
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,280
Be bonded in a way that would be better for CLT

1529
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,240
Or glue better

1530
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,520
Whatever it might be

1531
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,720
The first thing you don't want to do

1532
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,640
Is just homogenize the wood

1533
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:43,920
So you know you

1534
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,199
So as an engineer you want to know

1535
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,559
It's going to be a certain thing

1536
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,799
And then you can tweak it right

1537
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,159
And right now in our forest

1538
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:52,559
The variability in wood properties is incredible

1539
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,199
So you first want to be able

1540
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:56,799
To probably clone trees

1541
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,000
And the problem with that

1542
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,279
Is that it's not affordable

1543
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:02,799
In the industry right now

1544
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,000
So unless you get to that

1545
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,879
That's again

1546
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:05,679
You know

1547
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:07,519
Crawl walk before you run

1548
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,480
We're not going to get there

1549
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,599
So I also told them that

1550
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,440
The industry until we can get to those barriers

1551
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,639
We're not ready for it

1552
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,079
And that's a matter of economics

1553
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,240
And probably also social acceptability

1554
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,920
Would it be okay to have clone

1555
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,280
Duggles for all over the landscape?

1556
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,920
I don't know

1557
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,960
What was the Sierra Club saying?

1558
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,639
They probably heed the idea

1559
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:25,760
So you know

1560
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,720
So industry

1561
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,400
But due to economics

1562
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,599
Plus concern

1563
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,400
It's just not happening

1564
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah

1565
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,599
Tell me about the Leopold leadership

1566
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:36,639
Fellowship program

1567
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:37,599
I think a guy that was something

1568
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,119
And fairly important to you

1569
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,320
Yeah that really is

1570
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,519
That's a great thing

1571
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:42,800
And it resonates today

1572
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,240
So

1573
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,920
Jane Leopcanko at OSU

1574
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,920
Standard Professor

1575
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,280
You know President of Triple White House

1576
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,640
National Academy member

1577
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,240
You know amazing scientist and person

1578
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,559
She and some colleagues

1579
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,280
Scientists don't

1580
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,320
Have the skills

1581
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,920
And the network to communicate

1582
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,080
With the media and decision-makers

1583
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,760
Like they need to

1584
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,080
You know

1585
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,519
Her interest was in getting

1586
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:07,440
More environmental science

1587
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,559
And science in general

1588
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,559
Into policy

1589
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,920
You know and most politicians

1590
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,960
Don't have science backgrounds

1591
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,239
Almost none of them do

1592
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:16,079
And so you need to talk their language

1593
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,360
You need to know

1594
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,159
You know how the

1595
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:19,199
How decisions are made

1596
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,759
And you need to know

1597
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:20,880
How to talk to the media

1598
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,599
You know how to talk to science journalists

1599
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,719
Non-science journalists

1600
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,960
So they she created this program

1601
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,719
It was funded by various foundations

1602
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:29,920
Over the years

1603
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,759
It's still centered at Stanford

1604
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:33,119
An organization at Stanford

1605
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,159
It still goes on

1606
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:36,159
And they train cohorts

1607
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:37,119
Of something like

1608
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,920
Twini

1609
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,559
Or so

1610
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,480
Leading

1611
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,679
Environmental scientists

1612
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:43,599
People sort of in a make career

1613
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:44,719
Who you can see

1614
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:46,399
Have been very successful

1615
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:47,920
And are going to make an impact

1616
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,599
And are called

1617
01:04:50,399 --> 01:04:51,199
To

1618
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,159
To speak to the world

1619
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,199
To change the world

1620
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:55,359
Very much like who I was growing up

1621
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,319
And who I still am

1622
01:04:56,879 --> 01:04:58,399
And so you apply

1623
01:04:58,399 --> 01:04:59,279
You say what you do

1624
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:00,960
You look at your publication record

1625
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,759
Your passions

1626
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:02,719
Your skills

1627
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,920
And so I was one

1628
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,279
I think I may be the only

1629
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,880
person who would call

1630
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,400
Themself a biotechnologist

1631
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,440
In that program

1632
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,960
It's mostly ecologists

1633
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:12,640
Few lawyers involved

1634
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,000
We'll be conunders

1635
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,880
But it's been pretty much

1636
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,800
Very strongly environmental people

1637
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,000
People not so much working

1638
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,800
On the

1639
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,600
The

1640
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,880
Technology side of it

1641
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,160
But anyway

1642
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,200
This

1643
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,880
This group has been going on now

1644
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,160
I'm going to guess 20 years

1645
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,920
Something like that

1646
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,120
But they have these cohorts

1647
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,480
Of

1648
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,760
Scientists who come through

1649
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,640
And a lot of them are now

1650
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,960
You know very well established in the field

1651
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,400
And there's a network of them

1652
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,440
And they communicate

1653
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,639
And they collaborate

1654
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,320
And they try to organize action

1655
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,760
Or let us to the editor

1656
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,360
And conferences

1657
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,639
So particularly now

1658
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:46,240
And you know with all the things going on

1659
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,679
On the CHOP administration

1660
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:48,559
It's kind of been

1661
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:49,760
You know come back to life

1662
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,159
And where they're really trying to do things

1663
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:52,960
And so far

1664
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,039
And so anyway

1665
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,639
That's I'm part of that organization

1666
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:58,480
And you know I love to see information

1667
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,599
They share about

1668
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:00,880
How to be more effective

1669
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,320
What do you do now as a scientist

1670
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,679
What's the right thing to do

1671
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,040
There's a discussion going on

1672
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,400
About whether it's

1673
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,360
Good or bad

1674
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,000
To engage in the March for science

1675
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,080
Next month

1676
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,920
Is that politicizing science more

1677
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,840
Making us more

1678
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,120
Of a special interest group

1679
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:17,840
Versus you know

1680
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,120
Arbitives of truth

1681
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,160
Or not

1682
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,360
Or we have to

1683
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,560
And so that's an example

1684
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,320
Of how that network helps

1685
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,280
People think

1686
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,640
Distribute information

1687
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,560
And so it's very nice

1688
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,440
You know like I said

1689
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,560
I'm a

1690
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,240
Kind of an outsider in it

1691
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,360
And I kind of feel like

1692
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,480
When it comes to GMO

1693
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,000
Those in biotechnology

1694
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,280
And agriculture

1695
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,400
Probably the majority of them are

1696
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,120
A negative on it

1697
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:40,400
You know

1698
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,000
And I'm kind of a lone wolf there

1699
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,800
And saying

1700
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,680
And this is powerful

1701
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,880
We just have to use it right

1702
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,640
So uh

1703
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,200
I know

1704
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,000
So I'm

1705
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,720
I'm buzzing that

1706
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,079
And it's important to me

1707
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,519
But it's also a network

1708
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,039
Of environmental scientists

1709
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,400
That are mostly

1710
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,760
I'm not interested in the kind of stuff

1711
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,880
That I do

1712
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,920
So

1713
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,640
Anyway there it is

1714
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,440
I'm not

1715
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,240
I'm not

1716
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:00,960
Superactive

1717
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,840
And by any means

1718
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,800
Probably because as I said

1719
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,600
It doesn't

1720
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,440
It's kind of a little bit to the

1721
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,400
To the left

1722
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,280
Whatever it is of

1723
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,320
Where I'm at in terms of using technology

1724
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,840
In the world

1725
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,280
Can you talk a bit more about GMOs

1726
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,240
With respect to food

1727
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,440
That's obviously a big

1728
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,440
Big issue for people

1729
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,080
Yeah, you know

1730
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,440
I followed that

1731
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,400
Pretty intensive

1732
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,519
Teacher batter at OSU

1733
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:22,240
I've been doing that

1734
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,440
I had this outreach program

1735
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,200
It's very hot

1736
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,400
And very political

1737
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,120
And

1738
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,080
You know I think one thing

1739
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:28,960
That's really clear

1740
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,680
Is that it's

1741
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,440
Mostly not about the science

1742
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,880
I think the people who

1743
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,560
Are very against GMOs

1744
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,560
Want to make it about

1745
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,400
Very dangerous

1746
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,240
Inadequately studied science

1747
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,560
And I just think

1748
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,600
For them that's a tool

1749
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,560
Attacked it

1750
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,240
I think

1751
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,920
The people in the know

1752
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,680
No better

1753
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,200
Than that

1754
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,320
So but there's you know

1755
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,280
There's there's

1756
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,800
Issues of intensive

1757
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,680
Probably the biggest issue

1758
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,240
Is industrial agriculture in general

1759
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,519
You know on it's

1760
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,320
Incredible benefits and incredible harms

1761
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,360
You know probably plowing

1762
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,559
Is the most damaging thing

1763
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,559
We do the whole planning

1764
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,320
But it's not just industrial agriculture

1765
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,000
The plows it's

1766
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,119
Organic agriculture

1767
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,159
And everybody else

1768
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,920
And they often do it more

1769
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,840
So you know

1770
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,079
And then you have

1771
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:22,239
Use of agricultural chemicals

1772
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:23,920
Which are an incredible energy

1773
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,680
Saver and productivity

1774
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,880
And answer

1775
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,960
But they can be used

1776
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,640
With they can harm things

1777
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,920
You know the Rachel Carson

1778
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,920
And Silent Spring helped show that for DDT

1779
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,160
And so now we're in a whole different era

1780
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,119
Than we were back then

1781
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:38,079
Where things are

1782
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,560
Intensively regulated and monitored

1783
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,200
And many bad things have been taken off markets

1784
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,119
And you know at least in the western world

1785
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,240
And to get a chemical approved

1786
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,520
You know it takes

1787
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,039
I think hundreds of millions of dollars

1788
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:52,320
Of tests and studies

1789
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,079
And the labels that are restricted to use

1790
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:55,200
And so forth

1791
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,720
So there's a lot of safeguards

1792
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,240
Built into the system we didn't have

1793
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,400
Back in the in the old days

1794
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,000
But it's a good enough

1795
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,200
Now it's not going to be perfect

1796
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,640
We're going to make mistakes

1797
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,760
So how do you think about chemicals used in agriculture

1798
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,119
And you have systems like

1799
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:10,800
The organic certification system

1800
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,760
That's a

1801
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,520
It won't use any

1802
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,000
Except actually for quite a long list of exceptions

1803
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,520
If you read the details

1804
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,760
But

1805
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,880
So that's another element

1806
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,920
And the

1807
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,240
The major GMO crops now

1808
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,200
Use chemicals

1809
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,400
Directly and directly

1810
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,800
They use chemicals in the form of

1811
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,079
Promoting herbicides

1812
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:31,520
By being herbicide resistant

1813
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,239
They use chemicals in the sense of

1814
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:35,760
Isolating a pesticide

1815
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,520
From a bacterium

1816
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,560
And putting it into plants

1817
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,159
And this pesticide is something called

1818
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:42,960
BT

1819
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,520
Is one that's widely used in organic agriculture

1820
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,720
So it's very very very safe

1821
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,119
And I've spliced it into a plant

1822
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:50,560
Well now it's supposed to be very unsafe

1823
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,800
So you know there is all

1824
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,400
But anyway, but it involves

1825
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,239
Things like chemicals and it involves

1826
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,920
Intensive EPA regulation

1827
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:01,760
And the more you regulate

1828
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,479
Doesn't mean

1829
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:03,840
That people feel better about it

1830
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:06,800
It means it actually shines a big spotlight on it

1831
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:08,960
And so

1832
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:11,119
It's just extremely messy

1833
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,639
Both from a society and so on

1834
01:10:12,639 --> 01:10:13,359
And of course

1835
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:15,679
The science continues to grow

1836
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:16,319
And it invades

1837
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,599
There's new stuff

1838
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,319
All the time

1839
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:21,599
So how much regulation

1840
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:23,920
Just impedes public benefits

1841
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:26,479
And impedes economic development

1842
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,920
Versus protects

1843
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,680
The public and the environment

1844
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,040
And getting that right is crucial

1845
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,040
And you know

1846
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,000
And by no means

1847
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,280
A supporter of the current

1848
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,560
Presidential Administration

1849
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,000
And the particular individual

1850
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,120
But the issue of how much regulation is too much

1851
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,200
Is a really hard technical one

1852
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,480
And the sound bites you get

1853
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,960
And all the news media are generally misleading and wrong

1854
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,720
But in the area of biotech

1855
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,600
And I've written a lot

1856
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,040
I think the regulations are

1857
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,320
Totally out of control

1858
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,000
There are some kinds of biotech

1859
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,840
That should be intensively regulated

1860
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,199
Probably more than we have now

1861
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,720
Another kind is really there's

1862
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,360
There's a good record

1863
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,360
That there's no regulation needed at all

1864
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,079
Zero

1865
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:04,000
We have this single gene editing

1866
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,960
The new technology

1867
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,079
From modifying

1868
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,760
The natural DNA there

1869
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:09,440
To for straining reason

1870
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,560
Which is what breeding does

1871
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,400
But now we do it with science and precision

1872
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,880
That's probably going to be

1873
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,600
Regulated

1874
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,400
Certainly in Europe

1875
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,840
Like it's taking the gene

1876
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,680
From a far away species

1877
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,800
It's from my plenty

1878
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,360
Just crazy

1879
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,600
This is the CRISPR technique

1880
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:23,760
Yeah

1881
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,039
This is the CRISPR technique

1882
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,079
But that's kind of

1883
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:28,479
And you know that's a big source of controversy right now

1884
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,039
The USDA pedaled a proposal

1885
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:33,600
To not regulate some parts of that

1886
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,640
Which I think is you know

1887
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,079
Innovative and forward looking

1888
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:37,039
I don't know what's going to happen

1889
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,399
Under the current administration

1890
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,640
In Europe it's very likely to go that way

1891
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,079
Either way the organic people

1892
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,640
Are going to

1893
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,680
I've already said I'm record

1894
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,640
They will not accept it

1895
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:46,560
So um

1896
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,920
You know it's just

1897
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,519
An ugly messy area

1898
01:11:49,519 --> 01:11:50,560
Frankly

1899
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,600
And it's

1900
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,640
Rife was traded off

1901
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,000
So I just gave a talk

1902
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Last night to my own laboratory group

1903
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,520
There was a very good paper lately

1904
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,479
On uh

1905
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:00,000
The

1906
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,159
The record of GMO crops

1907
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,000
In terms of pesticide use

1908
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,800
To use more

1909
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,680
To use less

1910
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,840
These better kinds of chemicals

1911
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,000
And the reality is it's a mixed bag

1912
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,880
We're doing all that

1913
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,000
Depending on the crop

1914
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,279
And the time frame

1915
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,399
And it's just that's the reality of it

1916
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:17,439
But we know there's also

1917
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:19,600
Billions and benefits to the economy

1918
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,720
We know there's also

1919
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,079
Improved soil as a result

1920
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,319
So what's the right answer?

1921
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:26,239
So if you like

1922
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,439
Instead of simple answers

1923
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:28,720
This is not the area for you

1924
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:30,640
So that's you know that's

1925
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,600
So that's sort of

1926
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,479
I tried to

1927
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:34,000
When I speak about impeach about it

1928
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,399
I try to give students a sense of both

1929
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:38,479
The frustration and anger

1930
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,479
At this simple-minded

1931
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:41,519
Social response

1932
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:42,640
No GMO labels

1933
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,960
Organic certification

1934
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,399
You know I'm cleaner and better than you

1935
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,159
And a big reason of that

1936
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,359
People go to organic now

1937
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:50,479
So avoid GMOs

1938
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,240
Regulations are so intense

1939
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,520
That breeders like me

1940
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,200
I could be breeding populace

1941
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,160
For Oregon

1942
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,520
Using GMO techniques

1943
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,480
Except that it cost me

1944
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,760
A hundred million dollars

1945
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,040
To release one variety

1946
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,440
Even if with CRISPR

1947
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,200
It's just like

1948
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,920
On the other hand

1949
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,960
You know we have companies

1950
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,640
Overusing herbicides

1951
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,480
And creating herbicide-resistant weeds

1952
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,240
So it's just

1953
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,920
Really complicated and difficult

1954
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,159
So my own personal point of view

1955
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,159
Is don't throw out the baby with the bath water

1956
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,520
You know

1957
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,199
Take some intelligent middle ground

1958
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
But that's not where society's at

1959
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,760
In terms of marketing and labels

1960
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,520
That's not where regulations tend to be

1961
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,680
The regulations reflect people's fears

1962
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,600
Regulators like to say they're science-based

1963
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:41,920
No where are they really science-based

1964
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,640
They try

1965
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,279
They're always trying

1966
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:45,520
But the political pressure is incredible

1967
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,199
In the US and in Europe

1968
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,119
To actually make a science-based decision

1969
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,359
The activist groups

1970
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,680
Work so hard to influence the science

1971
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,199
To get their people

1972
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,920
On the boards

1973
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,559
And to change the way decisions are made

1974
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,840
So again, you know, I was so

1975
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,319
I used to be a member of Greenpeace

1976
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:03,760
And they were a club and friends of the earth

1977
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,640
And all these guys

1978
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,439
And now I wouldn't give them a dollar

1979
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:08,159
So you know

1980
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,279
That's where I started

1981
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,599
Right

1982
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,680
And now I don't trust them

1983
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,680
I give a lot of money

1984
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,279
To a certain environmental organizations

1985
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:16,559
Like the Nature Conservancy

1986
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:18,559
That are really science-based

1987
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,920
But these guys are not

1988
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,760
So who's the good guys anymore

1989
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,320
So anyway

1990
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,360
In the whole food

1991
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,120
GMO food biotechnology

1992
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,920
Or you get all that

1993
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,000
The good guys are the bad guys

1994
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,280
The bad guys are the good guys

1995
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,120
How do you decide

1996
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,120
Yeah

1997
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,200
I have a note here to ask you about

1998
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,960
The future of forests

1999
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah

2000
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,480
Right

2001
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,000
Which is a big question

2002
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,480
But yeah

2003
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,840
And here you talk

2004
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,360
It feels to me like

2005
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,560
A lot of what you're doing now

2006
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,440
You're creating work that might be used

2007
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,039
In the future in a different environment

2008
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:51,440
Yeah

2009
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,480
And I think that's right

2010
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,760
Is it fair to assume

2011
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,280
You think that the future of forests

2012
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,960
Might on some all would depend upon

2013
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,039
genetic engineering

2014
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,200
Well you know, I've made the argument

2015
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,000
One thing you have in the world

2016
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,120
With climate change

2017
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,600
With people traveling around the world

2018
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,680
With pests evolving ever more fast

2019
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,560
The stresses on forests are enormous

2020
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,840
There is you know

2021
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,120
Various papers recording

2022
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,920
You know the hundreds

2023
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,200
Introduced and new pests

2024
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,120
That are damaging forests everywhere

2025
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,800
It's an incredible difficult thing

2026
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,360
And you know

2027
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,880
The main way we deal with that

2028
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
Is through biocontrol

2029
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,080
Conventional breeding

2030
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,360
But sometimes those don't work

2031
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,440
And so one case

2032
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,200
You may know the story of the American chestnut

2033
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,240
I don't know if you're familiar with that

2034
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,440
It's a species

2035
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,720
That was a dominant species

2036
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,240
Much like Douglass fur around here

2037
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,640
All over the East Coast

2038
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,880
Entirely destroyed by an exotic fungus

2039
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,359
And so that was a hundred years ago

2040
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,680
And now people have been working

2041
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,199
Through conventional breeding

2042
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:52,640
And biocontrol to the story

2043
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,400
And so far not much left

2044
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:56,640
And so a scientist

2045
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,319
In a state University of New York

2046
01:15:58,319 --> 01:15:59,199
Has found

2047
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:02,400
He studied the mechanism of disease

2048
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,279
The pathogenesis

2049
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:04,640
How it really works

2050
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,560
And it's like other pathogens

2051
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,720
Where he's found that they produce

2052
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,960
This thing called oxalic acid

2053
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,239
That actually

2054
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,600
Is what kills the tissues

2055
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,120
It produces oxalic acid

2056
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,240
It kills the tissues

2057
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,120
And the fungus acts

2058
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,000
As kind of a

2059
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,560
Saperified and just basically eats the dead tissue

2060
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,079
And he said, well if we can just

2061
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:23,600
Get rid of their oxalic acid

2062
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,800
Or turn it way down

2063
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,120
Maybe we'll turn it from a pathogen

2064
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,320
Into a saprified

2065
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,760
It'll still be around

2066
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,720
But

2067
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,079
I'm talking really damaged trees

2068
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:32,560
So he did

2069
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,760
He's done that

2070
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,560
Kind of an amazing thing

2071
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,920
He took a gene from wheat

2072
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,720
In fact

2073
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,760
Put it into chestnut

2074
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,480
And

2075
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,680
He's appeared to be resistant

2076
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,520
So there's a case

2077
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,800
Where genetic engineering

2078
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,600
was important

2079
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,680
And it was able to very, very quickly

2080
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,680
Do what breeding other techniques couldn't do

2081
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,159
And so that's kind of

2082
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,600
A well-known case

2083
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,279
But then we have lots of other species

2084
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:54,880
That are sort of an earlier stages

2085
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,560
Of that same devastation

2086
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,520
There's an emerald ash borer

2087
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,440
There's hemlocked delgit

2088
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,560
A few other things around the world

2089
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,920
That are in that category

2090
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,000
What looks really bad for the species

2091
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,039
So from my point of view

2092
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:10,560
When you have a crisis like that

2093
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,840
You want to use all your tools

2094
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,039
And genetic engineering is definitely one

2095
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:15,760
Where you come in

2096
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,279
You don't say well

2097
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:19,680
What genetic variation the tree species has

2098
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,360
Is going to have to be good enough

2099
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,000
You say

2100
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,760
What are all the tools I have

2101
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,720
And if a guy

2102
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,760
Stay University of New York

2103
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,239
Or elsewhere

2104
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,800
Says I think I understand how this pathogen works

2105
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,400
Let's take a gene

2106
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:30,880
And move it

2107
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,800
Let's tweak a native gene

2108
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,600
Maybe we have

2109
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,400
We do have some things

2110
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,560
That are somewhat similar in chestnut

2111
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,840
But we need to edit it

2112
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,360
We need to do crisper to change it

2113
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,760
And let's do it faster

2114
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,960
Because this is an emergency

2115
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,560
To get this out and start testing it

2116
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:44,800
Right?

2117
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,000
We can't wait

2118
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,239
For 20 years of regulatory analysis

2119
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,440
And ecological approval

2120
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,440
But we can't do that

2121
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,440
Can't do that today

2122
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,800
Because of the rules

2123
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,680
And the regulations

2124
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,119
And people's phobias

2125
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,880
And the inability of companies

2126
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,680
To see that

2127
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,440
They could ever use such a tree

2128
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,119
So there's almost no investment

2129
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:04,400
In that kind of technology

2130
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:05,920
And to me

2131
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,280
That makes no sense

2132
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,239
That's just

2133
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
You know

2134
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,679
When you're

2135
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,800
You know the line between precaution and paranoia

2136
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:19,119
Procution is sort of

2137
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:21,119
You know taking intelligent measures

2138
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:22,880
To you know look before you leave

2139
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,559
Paranoia is being so afraid

2140
01:18:24,559 --> 01:18:26,479
And building an institutional system

2141
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:27,519
That's based on fear

2142
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:28,639
And that's

2143
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:29,519
I think that's where our app

2144
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:30,639
With genetic engineering

2145
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,159
And it makes no sense

2146
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:34,319
So

2147
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:34,800
You know

2148
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,279
Anyway

2149
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:37,840
So I think it could be a powerful technology

2150
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,560
For the future

2151
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,880
All trees could be semi-dwarf

2152
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,000
In a future time

2153
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,480
If people were to actually allow that to happen

2154
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,840
And maybe they'd be more productive

2155
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,960
And more stress-resistant

2156
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,720
But we're not going to know in my lifetime

2157
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,440
If that's true or not

2158
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,000
So you know

2159
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,840
So I think there's powerful things we can do

2160
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,840
That I think the uses would be selective

2161
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,680
These really more egregious cases

2162
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,880
That I mentioned

2163
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,119
Because conventional breeding is very powerful

2164
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,680
And there's essentially no limits on it

2165
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,560
You could take a species from anywhere on the world

2166
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,760
And move it here to Oregon

2167
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,960
And if it works

2168
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,760
You know it's fine

2169
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,880
So that's radical genetic engineering really

2170
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,320
And we can do that

2171
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,440
Without any constraints

2172
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,960
But if you tweak a genium

2173
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,200
There's these huge constraints and issues

2174
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,240
So why

2175
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,440
Mess with tweaking genes

2176
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,119
When you can do that other stuff

2177
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:25,840
So you know

2178
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,000
We sort of paint that ourselves into this corner

2179
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,560
If you want

2180
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,280
You know a bit

2181
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,240
So

2182
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,800
The graduate students

2183
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,840
I assume come to your lab

2184
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,439
Because they're attracted by your work

2185
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:37,359
And want to pursue similar topics

2186
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:38,000
What do you tell them?

2187
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,199
I mean it sounds to me like

2188
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:39,519
Yeah

2189
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,679
You hit a time period of

2190
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah

2191
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,599
Of cultural history

2192
01:19:43,599 --> 01:19:44,000
I suppose

2193
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,840
Where you can do the work that you did

2194
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,599
But that window is closed

2195
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:48,479
Well I tell them

2196
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:48,960
You know

2197
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,519
I tell them

2198
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,880
If you think you're going to graduate

2199
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,199
And get a job in the forest industry

2200
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,359
Doing biotechnology

2201
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:57,840
The job opportunities are extremely small

2202
01:19:58,559 --> 01:19:59,279
So I tell them

2203
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:00,960
You have to be competitive

2204
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,359
With any agricultural biotechnologist

2205
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:04,800
You need to be able to get a job

2206
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,840
One of those companies

2207
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,359
Or at the USDA

2208
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:08,960
That's still doing some of this

2209
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,039
Particularly for serious diseases

2210
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,479
And you need to have

2211
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:13,439
What I call

2212
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:15,679
Bioinformatics training

2213
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:16,399
Meaning that

2214
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:16,639
You know

2215
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,639
Putting the GMO thing aside

2216
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,079
You need to be able to do

2217
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:22,479
State-of-the-art computational biology

2218
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:24,239
Which doesn't involve GMOs

2219
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,679
Because that's the entry to

2220
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,039
Where most jobs are

2221
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,479
The broad area of biotech science

2222
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:30,960
So

2223
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,000
But otherwise

2224
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,960
A lot of them come to me

2225
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,840
Because they're motivated

2226
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,439
By the things we're talking about

2227
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:37,439
They want to see the world change

2228
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:38,640
Because they see how powerful

2229
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,920
Genetic engineering is

2230
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,680
They see all of this information out there

2231
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,359
Including from the good guys

2232
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:44,880
And they're

2233
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,880
Angry and they're passionate

2234
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,680
So you know

2235
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,239
I tell them

2236
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,359
I always wide open

2237
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:51,119
This is the reality

2238
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:51,920
So that's what they say

2239
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,560
But again

2240
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,279
It's really critical

2241
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:55,199
They do state-of-the-art work

2242
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,560
It just happens to be on trees

2243
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,240
And then they're going to post-doc

2244
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,400
And they'll be able to move into other areas

2245
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,080
A couple of concluding questions

2246
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,840
I'm interested in your perspective

2247
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,080
On change in the College of Forestry

2248
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,680
That changes very

2249
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,880
Visible to everybody right now

2250
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,680
It's as a big homework

2251
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,680
P.V. Hall used to be

2252
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,440
But tell me how the college has changed

2253
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,760
And moved in different directions

2254
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,440
And the years of your association

2255
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:20,800
Yeah, you know

2256
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,480
I think we have a great leader

2257
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,280
And you know

2258
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,240
Dean Thomas Matt

2259
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,200
It's very visionary

2260
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,880
Who really wants to move the college ahead very

2261
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:34,079
Powerfully he wants to sort of move into the environmental mainstream

2262
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:34,960
If he can

2263
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,199
He's trying to build much better bridges with

2264
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,639
Environmental organizations

2265
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,159
And we've had historically

2266
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:41,199
He wants to reduce

2267
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,639
The polarization we've had

2268
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:43,519
Amongst the

2269
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:44,639
More in pro-industry

2270
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,319
And the pro-environment folks

2271
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,800
And I think that's happening over time successfully

2272
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:52,720
He wants to move into the

2273
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,720
This advanced, you know, laminated

2274
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,159
Technologies

2275
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,840
And this new building that's, you know,

2276
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,440
A big part of the money

2277
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,480
And the push is to do that kind of thing

2278
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,079
I think that's really positive

2279
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:06,880
College is also now in different parts of campus

2280
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,199
And that's heard sort of a sense of unity that we have

2281
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,320
So, you know

2282
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,720
I think he's trying to set us on the right path

2283
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,079
And do the right thing

2284
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,119
And I hope he can bring his vision through the

2285
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:19,680
Completion

2286
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,840
But I think that's sort of unknown right now

2287
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,880
What kind of impact do you think the new forestry complex

2288
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,920
Might have on the college?

2289
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,720
Well, you know, I think new buildings

2290
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,199
I've been discussing this with various colleagues

2291
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,480
It was obviously a big cost

2292
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,400
And uh, but you know, the environment

2293
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,000
You live and work in matters

2294
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,319
It matters to how you feel

2295
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:41,680
How you interact with people

2296
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:45,520
I'm in Richardson Hall, which was about

2297
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,840
It was 15 or 19 years old

2298
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,480
But it was designed with lots of light, lots of wood

2299
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,800
And it's brought people together

2300
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,960
It's been, even though I had its own little design flaws

2301
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,400
We found out, I expect that

2302
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,680
Keeping out things like rain

2303
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,040
You know, it's a really beautiful environment

2304
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,840
And so I think he wants to take that to another level

2305
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,360
And create really a sense of greenness and collaboration

2306
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,920
And, you know, an innovation that I think a new building helps to motivate

2307
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,080
So, you know, I like the idea

2308
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,240
And I, you know, I think there was criticism about

2309
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,279
Whether it was green enough and how green you need to be

2310
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:24,159
To tear down an existing functional building

2311
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,840
But also quite old-fashioned

2312
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,920
And not a great collaborative space at all

2313
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,599
Very much in the old model

2314
01:23:29,599 --> 01:23:31,599
People basically infile cabinets

2315
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,199
So, uh, you know, I think they, I think they're not a lot to try to

2316
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:41,439
Be green while also making it something you can sell to donors

2317
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:44,159
Because donors don't want to invest in, you know

2318
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,239
Changing the sighting and existing building

2319
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,479
If they want to invest in a vision

2320
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:50,639
And so, I think he didn't really have the choice

2321
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,239
But to create a new building

2322
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,279
So, uh, now I'm hoping that, you know, that

2323
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:57,920
The dean comes back and the building is as beautiful

2324
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,920
And as functional as he hopes it will be

2325
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,559
And helps, you know, bring us to another level

2326
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:05,760
So, but right now I think we're in this kind of precarious place

2327
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,199
Where a year or two out

2328
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,359
I'm happy in that building

2329
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:11,039
And I'll build in projects I know of

2330
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:13,039
It costs more than you think

2331
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:14,960
And then you have to make difficult decisions

2332
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,960
As you go and does it actually do everything you thought you were going to do with it

2333
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,720
So, I think there's those risks as well

2334
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,239
But, uh, tell them, I'm hoping

2335
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:24,960
Yeah

2336
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,159
And my last question for you

2337
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,000
This is a sesquicentennial project

2338
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,279
And then I'm interested in your point of view on the university

2339
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,159
As it looks towards its 150th birthday

2340
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:37,439
Where do you think OSU is positioned right now

2341
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,760
Yeah, I've, uh, I really felt

2342
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,079
Really fortunate to be part of this institution

2343
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,439
For the 30, I think I'm going on my 30th first year that I've been here

2344
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:48,399
I've, uh, felt the leadership that I've had in the college of FAR

2345
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:50,000
She's been excellent

2346
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,840
Uh, John Barr and Ed Ray

2347
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,039
I think have been, you know, inspiring and responsible leaders

2348
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,800
Um, I have not gotten involved in administration significantly

2349
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
So, like, every other faculty member I know of

2350
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,640
I wonder if we are investing far too much

2351
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,920
Uh, given our limited state budgets in administrators

2352
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,600
They just seem to be everywhere

2353
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:16,800
So I wonder whether, uh, every administrator is really needed

2354
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,920
And what they're doing

2355
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,920
What their impact is

2356
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,480
Uh, but in general I like the ethics and the structure of the place

2357
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,400
And I'm proud to be a part of it

2358
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:33,039
So, um, you know, I, uh, I like the emphasis that we have on equity and diversity here

2359
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,200
And I think that's really important, you know, Oregon is a very white place

2360
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,920
And it's a white place for institutional reasons

2361
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,199
And in my opinion, those need to be corrected and addressed

2362
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:44,880
So I'm proud that we're doing that

2363
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,440
Pretty actively, we're doing them pretty actively in forestry as well

2364
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:50,079
So I think that's the right thing to do

2365
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,720
Um, uh, so, you know, in general

2366
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,720
I feel good about it

2367
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,159
I would love to see more, uh, of the administration

2368
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,239
Explain who they are, what they do

2369
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,239
And how cost effective they are

2370
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,840
And they don't seem to feel they need to do it

2371
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,560
So, I don't think that's right

2372
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,560
So in that regard, you know, I would love a little bit more of a business sense of

2373
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,880
Explaining to faculty

2374
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,080
How they're making smart decisions and what

2375
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,720
The administrative decisions that they make really cost

2376
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,120
As compared to, you know, I don't know, uh, could we have

2377
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,080
10% less administration, 10% or 50% more faculty members

2378
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,560
Doing innovative research and teaching

2379
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,760
I, you know, I just, those trade-offs, I don't understand them

2380
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,119
And I don't know anybody does because I don't think administrators

2381
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,239
Feel the need to explain them to plebians like me

2382
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,480
And I know I don't like that

2383
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,440
So, uh, anyway, but so in general, very positive

2384
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,680
But, you know, with some sense that maybe

2385
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,039
We have some runaway administrative investments

2386
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,520
And I think that's a common problem in higher education

2387
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,079
You know, so, uh, as far as I understand it

2388
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,119
So how do you, how do you reign that in or how do you at least understand it

2389
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:02,800
And decide if you agree with it or not

2390
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,760
Um, yeah, certainly not the first time I've heard that

2391
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,880
Yeah, yeah, but in short, I mean, I feel privileged to have been here

2392
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,000
The community has been an extraordinary place for me to live

2393
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,480
And raised my children and, uh, you know, as, uh, when I go back to my

2394
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,039
Yale reunions and those folks are all over the world

2395
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:22,800
And they say, hey, you know, you traveled everywhere

2396
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,520
Where, where, where would be your ideal place to live?

2397
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,720
I always say, I'm living there

2398
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,159
I've traveled the world too, and this is an incredible place to be

2399
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:33,119
Well, that's a good, a good enough to stop on

2400
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:33,920
Thank you very much

2401
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,119
I really appreciate this
