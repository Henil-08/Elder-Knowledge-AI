1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
So we are lucky enough to be here this morning to interview Charlie White, and it's May 18,

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
2011.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
It's too late.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,480
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,800
I want to start off by just asking you to tell us your earliest recollections, where

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,920
you're born, what year, and where you grew up.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,320
I was born in Detroit, Michigan, in April, 2014.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:39,640
I was the youngest of nine children, four brothers and four sisters all over the place.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,439
Their two of us left myself and brother next to me.

10
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:53,920
Typical shout, we were poor, but Norm said, that's not good enough because I never starved

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
to eat.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
I always had food.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,840
I always had a roof over my head when I close and the whole thing.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,960
And the old saying was, cardboard and shoe, we had a few, sure, sure.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,159
But I was just a typical childhood in those days.

16
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:20,840
What kind of things do you remember doing as a child, playing games, playing sports, my brother

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
next to me.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
I thought, kind of following his footsteps.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,280
He played basketball, and he played in high school.

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,560
He didn't go to college, but he played high school, but I used to watch his games, and

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,760
we'd hit the playgrounds on the weekends, we'd Saturday morning, had to break a dog.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,760
We were out in the alleys, and on the playgrounds playing basketball.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:49,159
It was more like a religion, I mean, we played all kind of sports, you know, and contrary to

24
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,159
property of relief.

25
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,159
There was a pretty good hockey player in my neighborhood, you know, being wintertime, we played

26
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,239
hockey, and we played tennis and all that, but the basketball just became the sport, basketball

27
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,239
and football.

28
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,560
It's a good baseball player, it's true.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:14,960
The basketball became the game of a choice, and I played YMCA, a Jewish community center.

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,879
Well, also one thing I did when I was 10 years old, 19 years old, I used to swim for

31
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,719
the YMCA, and I wasn't too bad, but we transferred closer to a place near my home, and everybody

32
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,719
left the YMCA.

33
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,000
The coach left and everybody followed him, and we used to swim against the girls town teams

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,520
from the country clubs and all that, and we did pretty good against these guys, oh yeah.

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,280
So swimming was big to me for about three, four years, from about nine to about 13.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,479
I'm still playing basketball, but I did, they're in the summer, I just swimming, and

37
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,879
they're even at big clubs.

38
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,879
Sure, sure.

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,879
But that's basically what we do.

40
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,479
What do you recall growing up in Detroit around the racialization of Detroit was there.

41
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,280
You said you were trying to get the kids in the country club to be there, sort of having

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,439
a kind of feeling towards you guys?

43
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,599
Well, they did, but I mean nothing was said, I mean, you know, they just felt, you know,

44
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:15,240
they had that superior feeling that, you know, they were better, because they had much better

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
facilities.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,639
We had decent facilities, but they had the country clubs and the whole thing, and, but,

47
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,000
you know, that feeling was there, and it was always there that we wanted to win.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,639
Detroit was a, I love Detroit, but it was polarized.

49
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,959
I mean, most of the blacks lived in about three or four different areas, and they were

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,879
there too, and Jewish people lived there, and the Polish people lived on a little place

51
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,879
called Amdrami.

52
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,879
Sure.

53
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,400
And great athletes came up, Amdrami, and that was like dindy high schools in Amdrami,

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,120
so we played against each other in this throughout the city, but it was mostly, there was

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,879
only one that I can remember, one school at that time that had mixed athletic teams, and

56
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,879
nothing.

57
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,879
Yeah.

58
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,879
Okay.

59
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
Which was one of the top schools in the city.

60
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,879
Okay.

61
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,879
Okay.

62
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,879
Roughly what year were we talking?

63
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,879
I'm talking about in the mid-50s.

64
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,879
Mid-50s, yeah.

65
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,879
Right.

66
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,680
So your high school, as I'm here, used to say, was not desegregated?

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
No.

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Well, I went to cash tech.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Yeah, sorry.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,120
To begin with, but I didn't stay there, I ended up back in my neighbor's school, but yeah,

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,759
the neighbor's school that I played the most basketball and was not desegregated.

72
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,680
The cash tech was, and they had, obviously, pretty good teams.

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Okay.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,680
But, you know, pretty much it, I did a lot of hard jobs growing up as a kid to generate

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
income.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,120
You know, I learned this from all my brothers and sisters who all worked and went to school

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,920
and did all the things.

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,720
They all graduated from high school, and none with the college, I was the only one who

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
worked.

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Okay.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,319
But I worked for, you know, cutting lawns, washing windows, you know, whatever.

82
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,319
Sure.

83
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,839
And I got a job with large grocery chain, Kroger's, and I started working in the meat

84
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,120
department, just kind of cleaning up and everything, and then I ended up getting a permanent job

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,879
as a stockboy, and, you know, doing okay.

86
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,439
And the church was just, it was rough in the neighborhood.

87
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,879
I mean, you had to kind of establish yourself, but sure.

88
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:32,379
I decided in 1958 that I'd see it enough, and the friend of mine and I decided to say

89
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,680
let's go see the world and join the military.

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,279
And we could have gone in for two years and gone to the Far East, but I said, now let's

91
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,680
go in for three and go to Europe.

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,079
I'm sorry, we're going to see a few more places, and that's what happened.

93
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,079
Okay.

94
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,079
Uh-huh.

95
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,079
And you were about 18.

96
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,079
17, 18.

97
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,079
20.

98
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
20.

99
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,079
Almost 20.

100
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,079
19.

101
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,879
And I played a lot of basketball there, was there?

102
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,879
In the military.

103
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,879
Yeah.

104
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,879
He talked a little bit about that.

105
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,879
Of course.

106
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:07,639
Well, we came in, and I went in to Fort Knox, a little bit right outside, a little bit.

107
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:17,039
And they had a camp team, and I went out for it, but I didn't want to, in order to make

108
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,839
that team, you had to kind of stay in the States, and you travel around, and I said,

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,560
I don't want to stay here, so I want to go to Europe.

110
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
I want to go to Europe.

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,040
And I got on the team there, and we played, we could be at like 50 games schedules and then

112
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
we had to turn them, and so yeah.

113
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
At the series?

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah.

115
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Lee?

116
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Yeah.

117
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:44,040
And then I played a lot of games, enjoyed myself, you know, we went to, went all over Berlin,

118
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
all over Germany.

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Right.

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,040
And at that time, the military was disagreeing, I remember.

121
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,040
So you were actually working with white teammates.

123
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
But there was several racial issues in the military.

124
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Can you talk about them?

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,879
Well, the majority MPs were, military police were white and from the South.

126
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,879
Okay.

127
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:12,920
And they harassed us consistently, whenever we would be out.

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,920
There was one African guy there named Bobby, something other, and he had a,

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,640
a club, a very nice popular club, and we would go down there and, you know, once, twice

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,920
a month, MPs would come and just kind of raid the club, you know, pull everybody out

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,639
of school, hang, coffee, you know, and we, our team used to go down there, but this was

132
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,439
a track team at this time.

133
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,439
Okay.

134
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,800
And we had white kids on the track team, and they would tell them to go home, but they

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
wouldn't go.

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,160
They would stay with us, and they would take us, you know, to jail, to lock up.

137
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,800
But we'd get out the next couple of hours because we'd call our colonel and blah, blah,

138
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
blah, blah.

139
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
You know, it was just arrest.

140
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Sure.

141
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
And it just, it just continued.

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Sure.

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah, sure.

144
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
It continued.

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,280
What else was some of your experiences in Germany as, so I meant, what position did you

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
have in the military then?

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
Because it wasn't just fully accurate, right?

148
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,879
You had a regular job.

149
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,879
Yeah.

150
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,560
I was just, I was in the armored infantry, what they called it, but I didn't spend a lot

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
of time.

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,280
I spent what they called TDY, which is temporary duty.

153
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
Now with the play sports, but I also was on the track team.

154
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
Oh, I didn't even know they had to.

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Yeah.

156
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Okay.

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Now I jumped.

158
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Okay.

159
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,760
And triple jumped and brought jumped, the mouse long jumped, whatever.

160
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
But yeah, I did that too.

161
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,200
So I did that to pretty much keep from, you know, doing them on the, every day, duty

162
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
is current duty.

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Yeah, right, right.

164
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Kids in patrol, you know, little sorts of things.

165
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Right.

166
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Right.

167
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah.

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,240
So did someone recognize you in the military as being a potential athlete for eventually

169
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,960
college or how did that team talk to you now about how that was really funny.

170
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,480
We were in the gym one day and I was shooting around.

171
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,560
And this kid from Southern California, he's on our team, Jones, Dick Jones.

172
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,759
He came in the gym and he asked me, see, what are you going to do?

173
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,159
I was getting close to my time to come back three states and he said, what are you going

174
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,159
to do when you get out of the military?

175
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,120
I said, you know, I really didn't talk much about it.

176
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,840
And he said, you got to go out to California and go to junior college and say junior college

177
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
is free.

178
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,519
Maybe you can get a scholarship to a four-year school.

179
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
And I thought he was joking, so I threw the ball out and told him to get out of here, you

180
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,000
know, chase him out of the gym.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, guess what happened?

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Uh-huh.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Just that.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I did just that.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,320
I got sipped to California from Germany, got out of the army, went to junior college, then

186
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
came with Durgan State.

187
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Okay.

188
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,759
Now, the thing that I noticed when I got here, I started seeing names in the paper from

189
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,200
some of the other junior colleges in Southern California, guys I knew from Detroit.

190
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
So there was a lot of young kids kept from each other who came out to California and went

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
to junior college.

192
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
What was that?

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
What do you think?

194
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,840
Because we heard some very similar thing from, no, because he said that a lot of guys from

195
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,160
his neighborhood is Washington ended up in California.

196
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,040
What was maybe going on back then?

197
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,160
Well, for one thing, the junior colleges back there were not free.

198
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Worked free in East Coast?

199
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
East Coast.

200
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
They were free out here.

201
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Okay.

202
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:18,000
If you were 21, you could establish residency and you didn't have to pay out of state fees.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
So you could go to junior college free.

204
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,439
And these coaches would help you get a little odds out here in there where you could work.

205
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:28,559
And then you got a scholarship to a four-year school.

206
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,039
So a lot of kids and plus, you know, who wouldn't want to come to California out of Detroit?

207
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,039
You know what I mean?

208
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,639
It's snowed this high and freezing and there's a lot of different things going on.

209
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,779
Plus we're getting in trouble, friends, relatives, you know, we're in that mix, you know, that

210
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:52,399
you see every day, I mean, when I was about 17, you had to be 18 to go into the pool halls

211
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,000
but everybody forwards some kind of paper.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,360
And I used to hang around in the pool hall and, you know, see a lot of stuff going on.

213
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,559
So you want to get away from that, mainly, just, you know, just, more future.

214
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,960
Yeah, yeah, just get out of that mix for a while.

215
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,280
And that was, you know, they just got started coming once a couple of guys came.

216
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah.

217
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
A lot of guys started coming.

218
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,240
And like I said, I saw the guys' names down in L.A. and different places from Detroit.

219
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,400
And so I said, yeah, it was the best thing for me to do.

220
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
But anyway, that's what I did.

221
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,720
I came to Oregon state and, you know, I'm going to come back down to that mix.

222
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,960
So you're playing in a junior college and someone identifies you and says, who was that?

223
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,639
You know, Paul and I were talking about that.

224
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:47,440
Well, I don't recall who it was, but I think it was a guy that played with Paul, his name

225
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
was Doug.

226
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,000
And I don't remember his last name, I'm not a fact of last time.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,840
I think I heard he was in pretty poor health, but he and Paul played together and they

228
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
were good friends.

229
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Sure.

230
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,720
And I think he might have seen me play in some tournament.

231
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
He lived in the general area.

232
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Okay.

233
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,560
And Paul and told him about me.

234
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,879
But one thing that happened, the year before it came, where that skill came down to recruit

235
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,879
me.

236
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:27,680
In my fact, it came to my house, and I talked with him, you know, and I didn't feel

237
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,600
good, just didn't feel, feel warm and fuzzy, I guess.

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,320
And then a couple other coaches told me some stories about him, you know, that I probably

239
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,800
wouldn't get to play much and, you know, sitting on the bench and that sort of thing.

240
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,920
And I said, well, that's just, it's not a good sign, so I just didn't come here.

241
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,320
And then the next year when Paul came down and we sat down and talked, like I said, I

242
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
just felt it.

243
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,920
You know, you feel something.

244
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,399
And like I said, when we talked about me graduating, I told him I need probably more

245
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,399
than two years.

246
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,560
He said, well, I can't give you that in writing, but I promise you.

247
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Yeah.

248
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I'll give you two years.

249
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
That you graduate.

250
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Yeah.

251
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,080
Not anything over the two that I needed to graduate that I would graduate.

252
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
And I felt that.

253
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,480
And then when I came up here, they focused on education right away as opposed to, you

254
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,680
know, just ask about it and laid out what I needed to do, and that's when I started taking

255
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
classes and got through.

256
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Yeah.

257
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,400
Come back, though, to your situation with FlatSkill.

258
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,880
At that point, the team was completely not to say, the team was sacred in the sense that

259
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,159
there was no African-Americans on the team at that point.

260
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,360
But instead of the California, there were actually work teams that were very, well, sure, very

261
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
mixed.

262
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Sure.

263
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,080
I wonder how, in your opinion, how did you think that he sort of rationalized that he wasn't

264
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,600
going to allow his team necessarily to have an edge?

265
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,960
Because at that point, I think it was really recognized that having African-American players

266
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,080
on your team was really an edge because they run a different game to the game that Norm

267
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,160
was actually talking to us about the game, that he was forced to play.

268
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
And that is a very kind of contri-

269
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Sure.

270
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Control.

271
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Control.

272
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
It was that completely different.

273
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Running plays.

274
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Yeah.

275
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Yeah.

276
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Picking screens.

277
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
We're on a playground.

278
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
It was, you know.

279
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
You just got it done?

280
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Yeah, behind the back.

281
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Yeah.

282
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Through the legs or whatever.

283
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
You know, we were out of here, whooping there before it came in the college.

284
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Sure.

285
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
You throw the ball up.

286
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Sure.

287
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,440
You know, I really don't know.

288
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Yeah, I try to figure this out because every year, and so that's had some good teams.

289
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,040
Yeah, he went to the battle for it.

290
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,600
But every year, almost every year, but for two years, specifically, that just spoke his

291
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
heart, I know.

292
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Okay.

293
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Be a Russell.

294
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Yeah.

295
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Was at the USF.

296
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Okay.

297
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
And they always played in the region, it was on the West Coast.

298
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Okay.

299
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,400
And the West Coast teams used to beat him every time, and all of them always had players

300
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
of color.

301
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Right.

302
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,400
And I would have thought to myself, you know.

303
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,840
You know, I don't know, you know, and you know, the thing that they mentioned about the

304
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,240
quota thing they had, you know, you start one at home, two on the road, but be a Russell

305
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,840
calling the phrase, you say, but five when you're behind.

306
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Yeah.

307
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,639
Be a Russell started that now, but I heard another explanation of that.

308
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,960
You start one at home, and two on the road, because you got to have somebody to roam

309
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
together.

310
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Oh, interesting.

311
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
You see that.

312
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,480
This is what I was told, you know, you wouldn't, you know, at that time.

313
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Yeah, sure.

314
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Yeah, sure.

315
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,759
And also at that time, in some parts of the country, you couldn't find logic for black players.

316
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,400
So, you know, if you had to go play in some areas, you know, this is kind of like the old

317
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Kentucky Robinson, Glenn baseball, the team stayed here, and he found him a place to stay

318
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,840
in the neighborhood at someone's home, you know, like that.

319
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,840
So I know some coaches had mentioned that, and they were aware of that, and some thought

320
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,200
of, you know, uncomfortable with that.

321
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,800
But I don't, I just don't know, I think he might have wanted to pull the trigger, but I

322
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
don't know.

323
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
He just did.

324
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Yeah.

325
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
And plus, there weren't a lot of kids up here for him to recruit, and most of his kids were

326
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
local, though, and if he'd go back and look.

327
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,639
Yeah.

328
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,800
Now, I think at that time Washington probably had some.

329
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Washington had an African-American players, yeah.

330
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah.

331
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,360
I was wondering when I was doing the research to see what was, you know, you saw that California

332
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,280
clearly had lost, and you saw, you see Adel had a, you know, the rest of Oregon, they

333
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,400
played them all the time, and yeah, this guy was kind of holding the line, and I was

334
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,760
comparing to Rupp when I was kind of understanding what was going on, what was this guy trying

335
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
to do?

336
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,600
But that was the feeling pretty much amongst those, you know, athletes in California and

337
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,480
in different places that he didn't really want in the African-American players, really.

338
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Right.

339
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,200
So, and I guess nobody wanted to be the first with him, because there was not that good

340
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,800
feeling about, you know, being quite a pair, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,960
And so when Paul the Lenta came down, did he ever tell you that, hey, I'm going to be the

342
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,799
coach next, because I know I'm in line, I'm in line, yeah, no, he was actually the coach

343
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,799
when he came down.

344
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,319
Oh, he's actually, you know, already got in the job?

345
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,319
He already got in the job.

346
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,319
Oh, I see, okay, right.

347
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,639
I had read about it in the paper, but I didn't think much of it really didn't, he called

348
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:18,639
me, contacted me.

349
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,639
Sure.

350
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,639
And then he came to talk to me.

351
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,639
Right, right, right.

352
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:22,639
Okay.

353
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:26,679
So let's not care the story on, just talk about you now arriving on campus, and what were

354
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,919
some of your earliest recollections for you, arriving on campus, you're seeing the plays,

355
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,919
what was that like?

356
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,000
One thing that was really funny, there was a female in the Charlie White.

357
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Name Charlie White?

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes.

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay, all right.

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:56,240
Well, I got to meet her later, look, I'm at her at a party, really, yes, but anyway,

361
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:06,680
when I first got here, they had us doing jobs in cottage growth, logging, logging.

362
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Okay.

363
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
So in the office?

364
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Yeah.

365
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,080
That's beginning of summer, so I went right into work.

366
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Now, cottage growth is down toward Eugene, I think is east of Eugene, out in the wilderness.

367
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,880
So they took me down there, and I mean, this was not a good situation.

368
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,720
The first day I was there, took me in the evening, and I said, hey, being me in at night.

369
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,640
So the next morning I get up and I come down and everybody's staring, and then the next

370
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,680
day, someone told me that it would be good if I didn't come out at night.

371
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:52,160
So I called Paul and said, I'm leaving now, so they sent somebody and got me, and I moved

372
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
in Eugene.

373
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,940
There was some guys in Eugene, there was three or four guys in this apartment, and it was

374
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,160
makes a couple of white students and a couple of, and they were athletes, and they brought

375
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,240
me down there, and I, and every morning, what we would do, we would catch a bus from

376
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,120
Eugene to the cottage growth, and we would come back to Eugene.

377
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,759
So they kept the job, but I didn't live in cottage growth, because I told them I wasn't

378
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,759
staying.

379
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,920
They need to get me out of here now.

380
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,120
So I came to Eugene, and then I worked that summer in the woods, which was good.

381
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
We made a lot of money.

382
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,160
I've been paying a whole lot, but at that time, it was a lot of money.

383
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,800
And we didn't have a place to spend it, so all summer long, we worked, stuck chicken

384
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,440
in the bank, so the school started, we had a little money.

385
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Right.

386
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
It was common for us.

387
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Yeah.

388
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh yeah, we could work.

389
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
First, we got a stipend.

390
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Okay.

391
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,080
Yeah, a monthly stipend.

392
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,240
So then, start the season, and like I said, we had a, we didn't have a very good team.

393
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,920
We were seven, seven in the back.

394
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,160
But actually, it wasn't the pack eight.

395
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Everybody says the pack eight.

396
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,480
It was the AAWU, which is the athletic association of Western universities.

397
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Okay.

398
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,960
But it was the original eight schools, the two in the Oregon, two in Washington, two in

399
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,440
Southern Canada, two in Northern Canada.

400
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,560
It was the pack eight, you know, the name pack eight became on the later, but anyway,

401
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
we were seven, seven in confidence.

402
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,560
I think we were 14, 10 overall or something like that.

403
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:32,679
And, you know, we, you know, we weren't really thinking anything big the next year.

404
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,679
We just wanted to be competitive, and I had played a small floor with my first year here.

405
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,399
But then they put me in guard the next year, and, you know, and all the guys, the only

406
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:50,399
new guy that came in really was, that really helped us with Harry, the only new guy, Harry

407
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:51,399
Gunna.

408
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:52,399
Okay.

409
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:53,399
Yeah.

410
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Yeah.

411
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Okay.

412
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:04,759
So they came in, and, you know, we, we, we, we, we were like a good seven, eight, and deep,

413
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,759
you know.

414
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,759
What year was that?

415
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,759
They came in, because we didn't find them.

416
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,759
65.

417
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,759
But Laura was not African-American.

418
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,759
We married Harry Gunna was.

419
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,759
Harry Gunna was.

420
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,759
Yeah.

421
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,759
All right.

422
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,759
Yeah.

423
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,759
Okay.

424
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,759
We'll tell you that part of the research.

425
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,759
Yeah.

426
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,759
Okay.

427
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,640
So tell me about that, that reception that you receive, you feel that you receive from

428
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,240
a student body in that first year, and then in the next year that you feel.

429
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,599
Well, like I said, you know, I'm oblivious to a lot, and I've been a lot of places, and,

430
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,599
you know, and all.

431
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,599
Yeah.

432
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:44,920
And so, I mean, sure, you got some looks, and, you know, you know, I just kept going, you

433
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
know.

434
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,720
I was here to do what I was here to do.

435
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:59,680
One incident was, one of the freshmen players, who I knew, you know, not very well, but

436
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,440
I, you know, I knew who he was.

437
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,920
We were on campus, and he was with his girlfriend, and he stopped.

438
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,980
And he introduced me, and you see me at a comment, oh, you're the one in my girlfriend's

439
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
class.

440
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Yes.

441
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
Okay.

442
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
And I said the one what?

443
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,779
And she was totally embarrassed, and couldn't even answer, so I just said, I'll see you guys

444
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:22,779
later.

445
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:23,779
Right.

446
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:30,099
But, you know, that was kind of funny, but, you know, you know, but, like I said, most

447
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,740
of the kids up here had never been around any, any back people, let alone go to school

448
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,099
with them, or, you know, because I had run into that in the army.

449
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:44,539
I mean, guys in the army, he lived, mostly southerners, who had seen, they told me they'd

450
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:48,859
seen back people from a distance, but, you know, they didn't know, you know, and that was

451
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:49,859
that.

452
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,299
Yeah, and they're from the south, living in a little small town, Mississippi, and places like

453
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,299
that.

454
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,299
Right.

455
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:01,539
But I didn't feel anything in classes, plus in street tunes.

456
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:07,779
Yeah, the professors, I didn't feel anything in teachers or students in the classes, you know,

457
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,779
there was an occasional, yeah, a lot of somebody's car, you know.

458
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:12,779
Okay.

459
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,779
Yeah.

460
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:14,779
Yeah.

461
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:19,779
And in finding accommodation in Corvallis and recreation in Corvallis, what was that like

462
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:20,779
for you?

463
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,859
Well, the one, the main thing is when I, the house I moved into when I came down, it was

464
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,980
already active at the African Americans, so I don't have a problem with that.

465
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
And how did you find that?

466
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
To the coach find that for you?

467
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
That, that accommodation.

468
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
I think so.

469
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Okay.

470
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Yeah.

471
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
I think so.

472
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
But they were football players.

473
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Football players.

474
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
And one was a non-athlete.

475
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Okay.

476
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
And one was a non-athlete.

477
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
He's a pharmacist.

478
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Okay.

479
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,980
But when we were in a group, we always told everybody he played tennis.

480
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,259
He was about five, four, five, five, and he was a little overweight, you know.

481
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,259
But he's one of my best friends.

482
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:59,460
He's in California now, but, but, yeah, they were there and then we moved to another house

483
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,460
on, I think it was 17th near the Coliseum.

484
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
Okay.

485
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
And we never had a problem.

486
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,460
We went over there and the lady, you know, and the rent was 17th.

487
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
That was 70 bucks a month.

488
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Wow.

489
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Then there was four of us.

490
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
So it was 17th, 50th month.

491
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
That's not bad.

492
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
That's not bad.

493
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
You know, plus the oil.

494
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
And the oil furnace in there.

495
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
But yeah.

496
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
And I was nice.

497
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Sure.

498
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Sure.

499
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,460
I never had any problem finding a place.

500
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Even those only two places.

501
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,460
Well, I lived in an apartment down.

502
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
I can't remember the street.

503
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
Okay.

504
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,460
But that.

505
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,460
Sure.

506
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
Yeah.

507
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
I never had any problem with that.

508
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,500
Now, in terms of, you mentioned going to parties, because I remember you said you had met

509
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
up Charlie Brown.

510
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm sorry.

511
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Charlie White, which is the female in a party.

512
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Did you go to parties that were integrated, or did you go to, when you had a social life,

513
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
what was that?

514
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Well, all the time I was here, not one white person that had been invited me to a party that

515
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I would got to recall.

516
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Okay.

517
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Now, I got invited to people's homes to have a drink or some dinner, you know, a thing like that.

518
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,500
But not ever once, a teammate or anyone, never invited me to a party.

519
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
But we gave a party every weekend.

520
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Okay.

521
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
At your place?

522
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Yes.

523
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
A 9th Street.

524
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
9th Street of Go-Go is what we called it.

525
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
At the time of the Go-Go.

526
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Yeah.

527
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
So, all the, obviously, all of the women at our parties were white.

528
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Okay.

529
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Well, with the exception of two or three, because there were Carol Smith and there was three or four

530
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
African Americans, women, kind of one of them lived here in Corvallis.

531
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Okay.

532
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,500
And there's a couple of ones from LA and another from, forget about Sacramento or somewhere.

533
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Okay.

534
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:47,500
But the majority of the women were white women and also Lloyd Peterson, who's white.

535
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,500
He came to one or two of my parties early on and everybody knew him and nobody, you know,

536
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
he didn't have any angst, you know, he's from Los Angeles.

537
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,500
So, he had been around black before and playing ball and black, so he didn't have any problem

538
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
with that.

539
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,500
And this Charlie White, I guess he found out we were having a party.

540
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
So, he came to one of our parties and introduced us out to us.

541
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
He was kidding the guy.

542
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
But, you know, we talked a lot of time.

543
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
I forgot.

544
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
He was from somewhere in Oregon, but, yeah, I met her.

545
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,500
And that was pretty much our parties where, like, we gave parties every weekend.

546
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:31,500
And we would even host other African-American athletes when they came to town.

547
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,500
If they were staying overnight, we'd say, hey, we're having a party over here, aren't you guys come over?

548
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Yeah.

549
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
And they would.

550
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Yeah.

551
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
I mean, then everybody has to go either side, don't sit.

552
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Right.

553
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,500
So, they'd come over and, you know, we became friendly with all the athletes in the conference,

554
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,500
up and down the coast, because when they came up here, we went to Washington.

555
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
You know, they'd host us, hey, you know, blah, blah, blah.

556
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
And then, we had a friend who, from Seattle, who got to school there.

557
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,500
So, when we go up there, you know, she would always have us, you know, over to her place and stuff.

558
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Sure.

559
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
And we go to Portland every now and then, so.

560
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Sure.

561
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Yeah.

562
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
What was the relationship like with the police when you guys had these parties?

563
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Was there any kind of...

564
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I don't know.

565
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
But I don't know.

566
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
The police ever come into our house.

567
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Yeah.

568
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I really don't.

569
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Yeah.

570
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I don't, don't remember.

571
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
That's cool.

572
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
And what about fraternities?

573
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
I mean, that's always been a sore point for a lot of students.

574
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Dealing with fraternities.

575
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
I think I got some...

576
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I got to feel from a couple of fraternities who they were.

577
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I don't recall, but I wasn't anything I wanted to do.

578
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Yeah.

579
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
On any campus.

580
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Sure.

581
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
I'd been in the military.

582
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
I knew I lived in barracks and all that stuff with guys.

583
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I had my feeling that I didn't want to do anymore of that.

584
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
I was just sitting on.

585
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Yeah.

586
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,500
What I'm getting at though is more of the tension that occurs because fraternity boys always seem to be down on.

587
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Yeah.

588
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Yeah.

589
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
In all kinds of negative ways.

590
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Yeah.

591
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
You know, things that...

592
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
But no.

593
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,500
I think I got like to see a guy feel out by a couple of people maybe invite to something, and I just kind of...

594
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
He's not interested in that.

595
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
What was I'm interested in?

596
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Okay.

597
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Can you now talk to us a little bit about your going through school then?

598
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
So you said your classes really well.

599
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
What did you end up as a major in how did you sort of then go on from there?

600
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Well, I majored in business administration with the concentration and personnel and industrial relations.

601
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:38,500
And I came here and I started here in September I believe of 64.

602
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:45,500
And I graduated in December of 67.

603
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,500
And so I left here in 68, 67.

604
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Okay.

605
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:06,500
I got a job with the company called Crown Zellerback, which was the largest one of the largest paper manufacturing firms in the West Coast.

606
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Okay.

607
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,500
And I got that through one of the alumni.

608
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
A guy who had played here with Paul.

609
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Okay.

610
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,500
And he worked for Crown Zellerback.

611
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Now, at that time, affirmative action was big.

612
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Really big.

613
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
I mean, yeah.

614
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Any black artist graduate could find a job.

615
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,500
You know, whether you're qualified or not.

616
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
And I said to say some were not qualified.

617
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
But anyway, I got a job with Crown Zellerback.

618
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
And my specific job was to integrate the workforce.

619
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
That is company.

620
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Yeah.

621
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,500
And this was in Antioch, California, which was about as a race as you could get.

622
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Really?

623
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Yes.

624
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Antioch is right next to Pittsburgh, California.

625
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Okay.

626
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Now, those two places are all 99.9% of African Americans in that area living in Pittsburgh and all the vice living in Antioch.

627
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
I didn't know that.

628
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Well, now I went down there to look for a place to stay.

629
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,500
I'd knock on the door and people would open the door and slam it in my face or some wouldn't open the door.

630
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Right.

631
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:31,500
So I went into Pittsburgh and I found this apartment house over there, which was not very nice place.

632
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
But anyway, I got hard to do that.

633
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
And I did a pretty good job.

634
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,500
It was really interesting when I, you know, they wanted African Americans and they wanted more women.

635
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Okay.

636
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Now, this is a manufacturing facility.

637
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Yes.

638
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Now, they had women working already.

639
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Yeah.

640
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
But of course, the women could only do certain jobs.

641
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Yes.

642
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Right.

643
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
That's very easy.

644
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Well, working in a factory was packing.

645
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Okay.

646
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
You know, they couldn't, you know, they couldn't work in shipping.

647
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Got it.

648
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,500
And they had one female lift truck driver, maybe two.

649
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,500
They couldn't operate the machines which paid the most money.

650
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Yeah.

651
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
They couldn't do those jobs.

652
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,500
So they were pretty much there, you know, packing the boxes and that sort of thing.

653
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,500
That's the way it was at that time, it's them also.

654
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,500
So, you know, I would hire people.

655
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
I would go out in the neighborhood.

656
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
I would go out in Pittsburgh where African Americans were Hispanics.

657
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
They didn't have a lot of Spanish working there either.

658
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
So, I'd go out and I'd get 10 or 12 people to come in.

659
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
And at that time, they used to do all this different testing.

660
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
The Wonder Lake.

661
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
All the time.

662
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
All the time.

663
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
All the time.

664
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
All the time.

665
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
All the time.

666
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
All the time.

667
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah.

668
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,500
You know, and you know, you know, so anyway, we got ready at some point.

669
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
But I have 12, 15 people in the room taking this test, you know,

670
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
and helping them with it because I'm trying to get people in there.

671
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
And I started doing that.

672
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
And I'll tell you, the people who were at that facility,

673
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
they hated every bit of it.

674
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Yeah.

675
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Now, there were probably 10 or 12 black people working there.

676
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
And they had been working there for quite some time.

677
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I mean, they weren't for a few people.

678
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Yeah.

679
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
They honestly did out of black person problem in the last 10 years or so.

680
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Right.

681
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,500
But I started filling them up with African Americans, Hispanics, and females.

682
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Right.

683
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
And they hated it.

684
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
They did what they stopped as people there.

685
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
They hated it.

686
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,500
I mean, people out to the department, to the supervisor.

687
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And the workers were just stared at me.

688
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I got some bad meal in my inbox, you know, about affirmative action.

689
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,500
And one guy was going to put a George Wallace bumper sticker on my car

690
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
and somebody stopped him.

691
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
You know what I mean?

692
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
It was bad.

693
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
It was bad.

694
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah.

695
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Yeah.

696
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I want to come back though, because I forgot one for you.

697
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Part of your story.

698
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
You actually got elected as...

699
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
I think you got an award here as you called the Leadership Award.

700
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
When you got it.

701
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
And I think it was 65, 66.

702
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Yeah.

703
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
They voted you as...

704
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
How did that feel?

705
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I felt great.

706
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Yeah.

707
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Tell me about what happened.

708
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
What happened?

709
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Well, it probably made me the captain.

710
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Okay.

711
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
What was that like?

712
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I didn't, you know, I surprised me.

713
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Okay.

714
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,500
And I didn't feel any angst from the team.

715
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I wasn't a yellow or a screamer anyway.

716
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Not like...

717
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Well, I was a yellow.

718
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah.

719
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
But I would tell guys, you know...

720
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
And we would have dialogue.

721
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
I wouldn't...

722
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
You know...

723
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Even in this stage, you did that.

724
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
You know, we would...

725
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I want to do this.

726
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Why don't you do that?

727
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
And when they come down here, let's make sure that we do this.

728
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Sure.

729
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Yeah.

730
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
That was it.

731
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
You know, it wasn't like...

732
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
I'm this and you got to do...

733
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Yeah.

734
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
It was just like that.

735
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
We need to stop these guys.

736
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
And this is what we need to do.

737
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Sure.

738
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,500
You know, Paul used to always say,

739
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,500
excuse me in the huddle, he'd say this, this, and this.

740
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,500
And then, as we broke the huddle, he would always say,

741
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
what you got to play the situation.

742
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Because it may not come that way, so you got to be waiting for it.

743
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Right.

744
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
And that's what I say, too.

745
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Yeah.

746
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
They may not go that way.

747
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
They may come this way.

748
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
They come this way.

749
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
We'll do this.

750
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Yeah.

751
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
And I feel good about that.

752
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Yeah.

753
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I really do.

754
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Yeah.

755
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
He felt good about it, too.

756
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Paul and I had a real special relationship.

757
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Yeah.

758
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
That's making the captain.

759
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,500
But more interesting, you reflect on the student leadership award

760
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
that you won.

761
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Was there a leadership award?

762
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
No, it was a leadership, I think, was just with the team.

763
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
With the team?

764
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Yeah.

765
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I thought it was one of the teams.

766
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Okay.

767
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Sure.

768
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Let's come back then to your...

769
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
at the company in Antioff.

770
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
So was that your job you continued on with?

771
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Or you said that you were...

772
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
I did that for a while.

773
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,500
And then I wanted to learn some more about the business.

774
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,500
So I took a production job.

775
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Okay.

776
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
And...

777
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Well, let me go back a little bit.

778
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah, I just...

779
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,500
When I was bringing these people in to go to work,

780
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
they had what they called a probationary period.

781
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
For these people?

782
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
For the new employees.

783
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Which were only 30 days, which is not a lot of time.

784
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
No.

785
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,500
But they were terminating these people as fast, almost as fast as I can.

786
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,500
After two, two, three weeks, almost 30 days up,

787
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
and they just said, well, they can't do the job.

788
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Yeah.

789
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Now, I said, well, wait a minute, something's wrong.

790
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,500
So a Hispanic gentleman named Leo Mijadis.

791
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
I don't remember him.

792
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
He and I used to talk.

793
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
And he came to me and said, you know, they're not giving these guys a chance.

794
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Yeah.

795
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
They're not training them right?

796
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
So after 30 days, these people can't do the job.

797
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
They're kicking them out.

798
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Right.

799
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Right.

800
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
So we got to do something.

801
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I said, well, he was a union steward also.

802
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
So I said, I'll tell you what we're going to do.

803
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:02,500
We said how we made up a form that had to be filled out every week.

804
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Right.

805
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Right.

806
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
The supervisor?

807
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Right.

808
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
What was taught to this just, you know,

809
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
and this person, male, female, whatever,

810
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
had to agree.

811
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Yes.

812
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,500
So at the end of the week, we would sit out with the union steward, myself,

813
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,500
and the department supervisor, not the guy who trained him a department supervisor,

814
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
and go over that.

815
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
And that guy said, nobody told me this, nobody told me that.

816
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Right.

817
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Then we could extend this probation period,

818
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,500
and then we made sure that they got the correct training.

819
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Right.

820
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Because we did that on a weekly basis.

821
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Took all the time, but, you know, we did it.

822
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Right.

823
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
And we kept starting being able to retain people.

824
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Because hiring people costs money.

825
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
It's a lot of working.

826
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
And you send them for physicals.

827
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
You spend money, and then they kick them out.

828
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Right.

829
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
So we did that.

830
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
But then I wanted to expand.

831
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
And so I went out in production.

832
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Work production for our shift.

833
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
Work plus production paid a little more money.

834
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,500
And then I was learning a little more about the business.

835
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:06,500
And then the safety manager left.

836
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
And I decided, you know, I had enough for shift work.

837
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
And I decided to go back in the personnel office,

838
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
since I've got my pay scale up.

839
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
And I went back in as the safety manager.

840
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Now I worked there for eight years.

841
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Okay.

842
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
And, you know, doing all this time.

843
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,500
And then I had an opportunity to go with a large construction firm

844
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,500
called Lone Star Industries, which was covered five states,

845
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Hawaii.

846
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Oh, okay.

847
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
So.

848
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
So often you get a job.

849
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
And then I was regional safety manager,

850
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
which was a big job.

851
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
And I have, you know, to get your car and all that stuff.

852
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
You get to travel a lot.

853
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
So I took that job.

854
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Did you have a family, at that point, or you were still?

855
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah, I had one son.

856
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
You had something like that.

857
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I had a son in 1970.

858
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Okay.

859
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Sure.

860
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Did you ever have any aspirations to be in coach?

861
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Because I mean, after you leave basketball,

862
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,500
I mean, a lot of guys kind of me have that aspiration saying,

863
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
hey, you know what?

864
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I can probably do some of this stuff.

865
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Well, you know, I did a...

866
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
I drove close to freshman here a little bit.

867
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Okay.

868
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,500
You know, and right after I stopped playing.

869
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Okay.

870
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,500
And I guess the reason I didn't stay in coaching,

871
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
I wanted to get back to California, really.

872
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,500
And so I thought the quickest way for me to get back was to

873
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
pursue my degree.

874
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
But otherwise, I thought about it after me.

875
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
It's not right after me.

876
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Maybe 10 years after me.

877
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,500
But I was very disappointed when Paul quit.

878
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
1970.

879
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Yeah.

880
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
1970.

881
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
He had to head coaching down for six, seven years.

882
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Right.

883
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
And he just gave it up.

884
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Paul was pretty disappointed.

885
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Did you ever talk to him about why that was?

886
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Because we didn't.

887
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Well, yeah, I don't know that he'd want to...

888
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Okay.

889
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Well, that's...

890
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Okay.

891
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
You know.

892
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Now, in terms of your connection back to Detroit,

893
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
it sounds like that got severed a long time ago.

894
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Oh.

895
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Meaning that you never really went...

896
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
How'd the aspiration to go back there?

897
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
No, not to do it.

898
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
No.

899
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
You kept your family back there.

900
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh, yeah.

901
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
In terms of, yeah.

902
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,500
But what happened is, five or six of my nieces and nephews

903
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
came to California.

904
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Oh.

905
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
But only one state.

906
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Okay.

907
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
They all came.

908
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
One went to Los Angeles.

909
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
They stayed a while.

910
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
They don't have a one state.

911
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
He's still in California.

912
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
But they all went back to Detroit.

913
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
But yeah.

914
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Yeah, yeah.

915
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
My family, other than my nephews,

916
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
here is...

917
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
They're all in Detroit.

918
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Oh, okay.

919
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
And so you do make regular...

920
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Yeah.

921
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
I do.

922
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Went back last year, twice.

923
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
So this year, just recently, when I was in Las Vegas,

924
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
my nephews graduated.

925
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
So a bunch of them came out.

926
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
So we had a nice little family reunion last weekend.

927
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Yes, sure.

928
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
So I'm going back in August.

929
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
One of my nieces is getting married.

930
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
So I'm going to go back for that.

931
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
But I'm going to be out of there before winter.

932
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm going back last September.

933
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I'm going back last September and stayed two weeks.

934
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Oh, okay.

935
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Yeah.

936
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Carry on the story a little further than...

937
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,500
You finished working eight years, or so you said,

938
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
as in any other thing you said you wanted to do,

939
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,500
the supervisor position where you were first now.

940
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Regional.

941
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
What else did you have to ask that?

942
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Well, I worked that for a while.

943
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,500
And then that company got bought up and they downsized

944
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
and everything.

945
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
So I went to work for a shopping mall.

946
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
I was the safety director at a large shopping mall

947
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
and then near San Francisco.

948
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,500
And I worked there for quite a few years.

949
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,500
And then I got into contract security.

950
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
I ran the contract security firm in Oakland.

951
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I was the branch manager there for 12 years.

952
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
And then just before I was thinking about retiring,

953
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
I went to work for Bayer.

954
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Bayer, come back.

955
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
That's pretty good.

956
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Yes.

957
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,500
And I worked for them in Berkeley for two years

958
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
and then I finally retired.

959
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
2004.

960
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Oh, okay.

961
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Nice.

962
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
But then I got bored.

963
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Okay.

964
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
So 2006 rolls around.

965
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm at home and I look across the street

966
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
and I see these kids playing basketball over there.

967
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,500
It was a school for mentally challenged youth.

968
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
So I went over there.

969
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Yeah.

970
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
They have basketball.

971
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I see them what they were doing.

972
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
And their people were there with nice.

973
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,500
And they talked me into driving the school bus.

974
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Yeah.

975
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Because these guys were pretty hard.

976
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
They had a lot of female drivers

977
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
and these guys, they were tough holding the women.

978
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
So I did that for three and a half years.

979
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
And I enjoyed it so much.

980
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
And then I try not to escape at all.

981
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Yeah.

982
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Now, coming back to playing ball, though,

983
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
or not just playing ball.

984
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
And after you left Oregon State,

985
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
did you ever sort of just play

986
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,500
or keep working out or any of those kind of things with ball?

987
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Oh, I played it.

988
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Yeah, I played it.

989
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
They're not there, you.

990
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,500
But I played for different teams all over the Northern California.

991
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Yeah.

992
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:07,500
We had quite a network of teams.

993
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Sacramento, you used to have the March of Dimes tournament.

994
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Lake Tahoe had a tournament.

995
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
They had a tournament down below Monterey

996
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
in a little small town called Gonzales,

997
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,500
which was a bird, but it was a real popular tournament.

998
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
A lot of extra college players.

999
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
You'd see them all the time.

1000
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
They'd go down there.

1001
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
You know, somebody would call me in the middle of the week

1002
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
and say, hey, we got a game up in Sacramento,

1003
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
and I'd jump in my car after work.

1004
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
In Sacramento, an hour and a half away.

1005
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
And I'd go play.

1006
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Yeah, I played a whole lot.

1007
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah.

1008
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
I don't remember when I stopped to land organized,

1009
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
but I played a lot.

1010
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
It was hard not to play, I mean.

1011
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Yeah, yeah.

1012
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
It was just something I did, yeah.

1013
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,500
And so, you know, wherever I went,

1014
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I was, you know, for one of the first things I did,

1015
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
it was fine, I'm wearing a gas plate ball.

1016
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
You know, I went over there.

1017
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
When I went to work down,

1018
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
and even got out of college,

1019
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,500
we had a better company team down there,

1020
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
across the other back.

1021
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,500
And he had, there was a lot of large companies around there,

1022
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,500
DuPont, Dow, American, US Steel,

1023
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
you know, stuff like that.

1024
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,500
They all had teams.

1025
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
And we had a good league,

1026
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,500
and we played in that league.

1027
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
And it was good.

1028
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,500
We had a lot of fun doing that.

1029
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Now, you were in Annie,

1030
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,500
I can, those teams were mostly integrated.

1031
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,500
And we never had any incidents that were involved,

1032
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,500
but, you know, trying to do something in town initially.

1033
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
It took a while before they loosened up,

1034
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,500
and I got to meet several policemen down there

1035
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500
and I used to hang out at the cop bar, so.

1036
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Oh, okay, true.

1037
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
You know.

1038
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Like the round.

1039
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
Yeah, so everything was cool, you know,

1040
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
because some of the,

1041
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,500
I had hired some of the policemen's kids.

1042
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Oh, to be okay.

1043
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
And to where I worked for the summers, you know,

1044
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
they worked on it.

1045
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,500
Really good jobs.

1047
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
Oh, yeah.

1048
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Yeah.

1049
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Yeah, they worked in,

1050
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,500
and so, you know, it was pretty good.

1051
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Now, looking back on leaving Oregon State,

1052
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
did you ever, any aspirations going on,

1053
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
on to play pressure ball?

1054
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,500
Well, I did.

1055
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
I wanted to play, but I didn't get drafted,

1056
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,500
and I didn't want to go take a chance

1057
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
and not make it,

1058
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
and then I'm not heading to school yet.

1059
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Okay.

1060
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Now, they had the teams that they have now

1061
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
all over the world.

1062
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Yes.

1063
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Europe and wherever else you want.

1064
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
They got a team.

1065
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
They have teams everywhere.

1066
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,500
Yeah, they sure did.

1067
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Got a job somewhere,

1068
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,500
because my nephew went down and played in Argentina

1069
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,500
for 13 years.

1070
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Oh, my God.

1071
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Yeah.

1072
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,500
So, I could have brought,

1073
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
but that wasn't available to us at the time I came out.

1074
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
And I probably would have jumped at that.

1075
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Right.

1076
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
If I knew that I could go,

1077
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
you know, play for a couple of years in Europe

1078
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
or someplace and make a little money,

1079
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,500
and, you know,

1080
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
could I could come back and finish?

1081
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1082
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
But you really put school to part,

1083
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
which is a great thing.

1084
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Yeah.

1085
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Yeah.

1086
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Yep.

1087
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Is there any questions you want to ask?

1088
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,500
At this point,

1089
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,500
because I think we're sort of at the end of what I had to ask.

1090
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
I think that you can pick up from the archive perspective

1091
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
that you wanted to ask.

1092
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Well, you mentioned Harry Gunner.

1093
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
So, when he came on the team,

1094
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
it was the 65-66 season.

1095
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Did that change the dynamic at all?

1096
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Was that nice to have another?

1097
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Oh, yeah.

1098
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
It was nice to have him.

1099
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Plus, he helped us a lot.

1100
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
He needed his, you know, size and strength.

1101
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
You know, he didn't start,

1102
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
but he played a lot.

1103
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Yeah.

1104
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Yeah, he was our sixth man,

1105
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,500
and he was the first guy out of the bitch usually.

1106
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
And, yeah.

1107
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Right.

1108
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
And now, it's really funny.

1109
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Harry and I didn't always room together.

1110
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
See, so, you know,

1111
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
because sometimes,

1112
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Lloyd and I used to room together most of the time.

1113
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
But you could always find the three of us

1114
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
in one of our bedrooms,

1115
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
you know, because we were close.

1116
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Yeah, Roy used to hang with us.

1117
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Because Lloyd didn't.

1118
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Lloyd hated this place.

1119
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Oh, he hated every bit of it.

1120
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Right.

1121
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Coming from Los Angeles,

1122
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,500
and he was one of those players that played,

1123
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
he was a playground player.

1124
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Sure.

1125
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Because he'd been playing with back kids all his life,

1126
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,500
and he was a playground player.

1127
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
He had more moves.

1128
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I'm telling you the cant of worms, as I say.

1129
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
And he could play.

1130
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Right.

1131
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
But he and Paul, man, they just did.

1132
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
They never got together for his three years here.

1133
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Wow.

1134
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Interesting.

1135
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
And now, he went on to play professional.

1136
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Oh, he did.

1137
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
They played with Chicago over several years,

1138
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
yeah, and then he found it.

1139
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Now, he married a girl from Madras, Oregon.

1140
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh, did you know that?

1141
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Okay.

1142
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,500
But he hated Oregon.

1143
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
And when he came up here and now,

1144
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
and he hated it,

1145
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
he and Paul just never,

1146
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
they never got along.

1147
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Never.

1148
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Yeah.

1149
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I mean, they were glad at each other

1150
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
in practice and on the bench,

1151
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
but, you know, it was just...

1152
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Yeah.

1153
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
And it was a hell of a player.

1154
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Right.

1155
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Yeah.

1156
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Right.

1157
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
Now, in the movie glory road,

1158
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,500
there was actually eventually some tension

1159
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
that occurred between the players.

1160
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Just about black and white issues about black players getting

1162
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
based on the black players taking their jobs.

1163
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Sure.

1164
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Did you ever get any kind of feeling like that?

1165
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
No.

1166
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
No.

1167
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
No.

1168
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
We were just so few anyway.

1169
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Yeah.

1170
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Well, first it was just a piece.

1171
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Yeah.

1172
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Yeah.

1173
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,500
Yeah.

1174
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
No, I never did it.

1175
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
I never got any feel.

1176
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
I've never felt that anywhere.

1177
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
I've never said it to me right there.

1178
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Yeah.

1179
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Right.

1180
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Yeah.

1181
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Anything else?

1182
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Well, I want to thank you very, very much.

1183
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Okay.

1184
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
It's a great interview.

1185
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
And it lasted exactly almost 45 minutes.

1186
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Yeah.

1187
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
It's a great stuff.

1188
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
So, we really appreciate that.

1189
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Okay.

1190
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
I got to go pick up Paulies.

1191
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
I know he's probably chomping it a bit.

1192
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Okay.

1193
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Well, I'm pretty sorry about the other one going on.

1194
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Yeah.

1195
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Okay.

1196
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
You know.

1197
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Yeah.

1198
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
But, thank you.

1199
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Are you going to be seen, Paul?

1200
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Yeah.

1201
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Can I give you his plaque?

1202
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Sure.
