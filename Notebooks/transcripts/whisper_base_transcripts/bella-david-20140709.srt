00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay Dr. Bell, if you would please introduce yourself to your name in today's date in our location.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Um, David Bell, and today is July 9th.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
July 9th.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, July 9th, 2014, and we're located at my place on the Portrait of Olymp cabin.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Terrific.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's start at the beginning.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You were born in Grinch, Connecticut.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Grinch, Connecticut.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Grinch, Connecticut, 1938.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And were you raised there?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was raised there pretty much, you know, for my whole life until I went to college.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can you tell us about sort of your experience of Grinch growing up?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, Grinch is an interesting place.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's a powerful place.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A lot of millionaires, we weren't one of them.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My dad was principal at high school.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And I went to the same high school.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I think I really learned about leadership.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He was very good.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He said, if you spend more than 50% of your time in your office, you're not doing your job.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So as a student, he knew what was going on.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was amazed.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
None of the students ever gave me any hassle.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They said he was tough, but he's fair.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And he learned all sorts of things.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And he did this by getting down to the trenches.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I mean, he'd go down the border of the room and just talk with the maintenance people.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He talked with the people serving up floating in cafeteria.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And he wouldn't ask him for anything.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They would just tell him because they were part of the team.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I learned that kind of leadership from him.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Unfortunately, we don't see that kind very often.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What were your parents' backgrounds?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My dad was a physicist.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I went to Yale.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He became a high school principal and a physical physics teacher.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And my mother was a pianist.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The concert pianist, she died when I was four.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I can still remember sitting under the piano while she practiced.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And we did quite a bit of camping.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My dad ran a summer camps for churches, Lutheran Church.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I learned a lot about nature then and the respect of nature from these big camps.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And they had a lot of these.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And their idea for helping kids was to get them into nature.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And that's what they did.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I had that background.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And my beginning of environmental concerns came out of the church background in these summer camps.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I had three sisters and older sisters and two younger sisters.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How was the household managed after your mother passed?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, my father remarried several times.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I just treated him as a normal household.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He was a very good mentor and he had male friends who ran these summer camps.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I had an anologa who was, she was quite a doer.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I never thought that women couldn't do anything men could do because my anologa obviously could.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So it just, you know, just never occurred to me.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So that was household.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We lived sort of in the country, not quite like this.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But spent a lot of time outdoors.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That was good.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What were your interest as a boy besides being outdoors, I suppose?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Outdoors, building tree huts.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I guess that was it.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean, I'm playing sports, but not, you know, not really that much.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So just hanging around outdoors and doing stuff, I guess.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Did you enjoy school?

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was not particularly in high school a great student.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like most kids at age, I enjoyed seeing my friends and seeing my friends.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's what I did.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What were your first inclinations towards science or engineering?

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, I don't know.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think I was always, I want to do something.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And so I don't think I really, I mean, I was pretty good at science.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was interesting.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And engineering seemed more like you were going to do something.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I just sort of, it wasn't any big decision.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I did decide to go to the Virginia Military Institute, which anybody knows is a pretty tough place to go, particularly that first year you're rat.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, take me through the process of making that decision. Why VMI?

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, VMI, like I say, it's tough.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I looked around a lot, you know, when you're growing up, kids, boys, at least.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's a matter? Can't you take it? They place sort of those games.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And you think, well, when I get older, I don't have to play those games.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's like getting, it's like I got older though.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I saw a lot of men were playing those games.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Same thing. I mean, I see it all the time at Oregon State University.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
People getting co-opted and afraid to speak up.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I said, I'm just going to go there.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then, you know, it's tough.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And if anybody says, what's the matter? Can't you take it? I'll just laugh at them.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You go through the rat line. It's pretty tough.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I think that was the way I thought of it.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it generally worked that way. It was tough.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And you saw it as a challenge that you wanted to take on?

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was a challenge, that's right. And I saw it as a challenge to take on.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I wasn't planning career military. I wasn't looking for a disciplined life.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It was a challenge. And I think VMI nurtured that.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You always had a maverick spirit, very rigid, tough discipline, but there was always.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There was a tension there, a creative tension.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And so I thought of the word challenge as a positive word.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And something's challenging. My eyes light up. Oh, okay. What are we going to do about it?

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, and it was a good education. Class sizes were about 2022.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I had some pretty remarkable people there.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Jonathan Daniels was a martyr in the Civil Rights Movement.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And he was a seminary student when he left VMI.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He became an episcopal priest and he got killed there.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That really jolted the South, unfortunately.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know, Jonathan had to give his life for it.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But he was quite a person. He's a valedictorian of our class.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, what was the environment like at VMI especially that first year?

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, that first year you were a rat. That first year and you're on the go all the time.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's physically and mentally demanding. It's psychologically demanding.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But all your classmates are in the same boat. So it's not like they're picking on you.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I mean, you're all in it together. And there are times of anus.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You say, well, they can't kill me. And this isn't going to last forever.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Somehow that that would get you through. And I thought of that years later in terms of racial prejudice.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because people can't say that. They couldn't say that.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And when I went back to one of my reunions, one of the most impressive things that happened to me.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There was an older guy there that was a maintenance person.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And he was black. And I told him what year I was there.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I think he says, oh, that's when he began. And he comes in. He gives me this big hug.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we're celebrating together. And it felt really good. It really did.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And they've integrated down there because it was not integrated when I went there.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And they've done a really good job. And there's men and women down there now.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So not integrated as in it was whites only. Or there were white classes and black classes.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it was almost all white. I think it probably was all white.

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And just in a South that, you know, as people just didn't even think of it.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And Jonathan did. He gave his life for it.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, when they decided, when they, at VMI, when they figured, this is a serious problem, they really set out to correct it.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And they really did. And we've had some remarkable graduates white and black and patient.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So it was, it was really, you know, I would say turning point in my life, I mean, to see that change is wonderful.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What else was expected of students there besides the coursework?

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, you had physically demanding. And of course, you're first year, you're harassed.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I mean, you're in the rat line, you're a rat. And you're on the go all the time.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And so it's hard to describe. I mean, the Marines respected.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I've had several Marines say, yeah, it's tough. And for a Marine, that's probably about the best compliment you can get.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And it's mutual. I mean, yeah.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So a lot of physical training and military drilling ice didn't work?

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, there's not, not a particularly a lot of drilling. You had to raise that you did and you marched and you wore uniforms.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But the academics were very good. And classes were small. And they were, you know, they were academically very good.

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So it's just tough schedule. And physically demanding. I mean, if you've got a chance to take a nap, you'd lay down for 15 minutes and go to sleep and wake up and start all over again.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But during the day, you didn't even have your beds down. I mean, you rolled up the mattresses. They were up against, you know, rolled up.

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And they called it a hay rack. That was leaned against the wall. I mean, it was, it was pretty rigid.

143
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But it always had sort of a maverick spirit to it. You know, one night we tried it. We put the evening gun and said, I don't know, 90 millimeter howitzer in the PX, you know, snuck out there.

144
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean, there'd be things you'd sort of do that way. And things, things would happen.

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So it was, you learn some things like pulling rank. That's really bad. I mean, if you, somebody does something, yeah, you got rank. Of course, you know, a dean or president has to do things. They have responsibility. We all know that.

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But if they do something and it's only because I got the rank, that's point rank. And that's not looked on pretty well. In fact, they'd have a parade in the parade. There'd be a flanking movement. The troops are companies, the tones are going on the line.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And the officer was a kid at officer, but being the front with a saber marching in the front. And there would be tack officers grading the lines. Well, if he had pulled rank, those lines would just go like this. And then he'd get chewed out. So they, you know, if you pulled rank, we throw lines.

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So I mean, it was, it was just pulling rank was not, not considered a particularly good thing. I see more of it going on at Oregon State University. And people sort of accepting it. That's the part that drives me nuts.

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You know, someone says something does something that doesn't make sense. People like and courteous, but tell them a lot of times they, you know, they may get upset, but they, they're really the best ones. No, they need to hear that.

150
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But I've seen just too many people with this blank face. Just don't say anything.

151
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So how your academic life sort of evolved while you're at the MI?

152
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, I actually got better grades at college than I did in high school. And I ended up with a civil engineering degree.

153
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I don't know whether I had any career aspirations of that. It was like you're entering a big open space. You're entering the future.

154
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So I didn't have an agenda what I wanted to do, what I wanted to be. I wanted to do something, do something interesting. I was more scout, I sort of explore.

155
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I guess, and I think at the MI they encouraged that you'd ask questions in class. And I thought it was a good education that way. I know we're bad teachers. Yeah, but you always are. But you learn from them too.

156
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, you took that education your first job was with the division of Indian health. Yeah, US Public Health Service. Right. US Public Health Service Indian Health. And I went to New Mexico and loved it.

157
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And it was a sanitary engineer they called them. And we put in water and sewer systems and Indian club blows. And I bring in translators. And then I got transferred to a state of Washington. And it was kind of funny because they said, well, there's a project that has a little bit of a problem.

158
00:15:37,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Any time a government agency says we have a little bit of a problem, that means it's a disaster. So when I got up there, the project engineer wasn't even there. And turns out that some woman had punched him out. And after listening to the stories, I began to understand why.

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But you know, we got the project lined up. But even there, there were some things, you know, you had to do like they didn't have enough parts to keep the crews busy.

160
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, if you look at the government procedures, it takes months to get the parts. Your budget's going to be gone or you have to lay off the crew.

161
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And so I just went out and told them wrote a memo and said, I'm going to go and buy some parts wholesale. And if this is a problem, please call me. And then I stayed away from the phone. So I got the parts.

162
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You know, and they were upset because they probably could have saved $30 by going through the GAO or no GSA. But, you know, the loss of money for the crew.

163
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So I mean, you did things like that. I loved the crew. I loved the construction. A lot of funny stories they tell me and had a good time. It was good.

164
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What sort of impacted living in Indian country make, idea?

165
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, I actually, in Albuquerque, I was living in Albuquerque and I go on the reservation. And in the state of Washington, I didn't, you know, I live off reservation. But it was more in the state of Washington, more like rural country.

166
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I love the culture, I love the dances. And it was a really good experience for me. So I sort of participated. I even broke my wrist riding rodeo. So I had a little bit of, you know, some good stories to tell. So that was good.

167
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What did you think of the Pacific Northwest? I've seen that was your first exposure to it.

168
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah. And I only, I was up in the state of Washington. And I did drive through Oregon and then went over to the coast and the thing that impressed me, the coast was, it was hard to get down to the beach. There were so many logs. I mean, there were just logs all over the place.

169
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And, and of course, now there aren't. And I think there were a lot of wasteful timber practices back then and long to just drift out.

170
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But so I really didn't, I didn't, you know, I was in Eastern Washington. And so it's quite different than Corvallis. I mean, I liked, I liked beautiful country.

171
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, after a year or two, I think with that job, you went back to school.

172
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, I spent a little over a year or two years in public health service. And I went back to New York University, right in the middle of New York City. What had changed?

173
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I mean, holy mackerel, I'm out in the, you know, out in the sticks and my arms and a cast, my rodeo accident. I'm ending up ending up in New York, middle of New York City.

174
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I did get a good education there at New York University. And I got into computer modeling. And this was back in the mid 60s.

175
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So I got into that for Tran was pretty new then. And I did sort of learn machine language, which was awful for Tran, though this was great.

176
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I had a very good major professor and I got into computer simulation long before most people.

177
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There were no PCs back then. There was no internet. I used to take cards down on the subway to the Greenwich Village. That's where the Quran Institute of Mathematics was.

178
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And they had a big computer then you'd give them the cards and they'd run it. And then you'd plot by hand the results.

179
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But you got to understand what a model does because you plot them by hand, you did them yourself. You could actually see what was going on in the computer.

180
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And now a lot of people don't see that. They really don't understand that. And consequently, I think there's a lot of misuse of computer models now.

181
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's what the things were you modeling.

182
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Lakes and estuaries. And the thing about estuaries is they're part of the river that's influenced by the ocean. And the tides come in and out.

183
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They're very dynamic systems of waters changing. And so before the digital computer, you had to make mathematical assumptions of steady state.

184
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And the sanitary engineers have been doing this since 1925. And rivers building mathematical models long before the scientists were doing it.

185
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And actually the rivers got better. They did a lot. There was a lot of good. And that's sort of been airbrushed out of the history.

186
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We may come back to that later because there was a lot of environmental improvements on rivers in particular that occurred there. And I was part of that history.

187
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But the 60s things were changing. We knew things were changing. We saw lakes were having problems. We saw all sorts of problems.

188
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And so that was a real era of transformation when I got here. The computer and a pretty exciting time.

189
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Was this also your first experience of teaching?

190
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, my first experience in teaching formally. I used to do some help sessions for some of my classmates back at the M.I.

191
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And my family has a lot of teachers. And so I loved it. So I had, you know, I loved the students and teaching. And I like the research.

192
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't like proposal writing. We'll come back to that later.

193
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Tell me about living in New York City in the 60s.

194
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, you know, I was mainly involved in graduate school. And there was some protests. I generally was not part of that.

195
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But my part of the protest, I was part of, in a sense, of let's do something about the problems.

196
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And mainly pollution. And certainly Martin Luther King Jr. had a profound effect on me. This is a huge transformation.

197
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And it was, that was a good time. I think that what happened a little bit after that, the drug scene and other things.

198
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I felt like that was very different, very self-indulgent and often destructive.

199
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So I really, I had a mixed feelings. I really identified, yes, let's make the world a better place.

200
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But there also seemed to be sort of self-centered naiveness that was associated with this.

201
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And maybe a tendency to blame other people rather than saying what can we do.

202
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So I had a mix, it was a mixed feeling, mixed bang.

203
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Was this, is it fair to say this was sort of the beginnings of your environmental consciousness that come before?

204
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, environmental consciousness came before, came largely through the churches. And again, that's been a whole history that they don't talk about.

205
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You probably have read that. You probably took the history of environmental from Bob McDermott.

206
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And that's just not included. Well, it was huge. I mean, here my father would have 300 boys out in this cabins out there.

207
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And they have nature counselors. And across the river was a lake, was a girls camp.

208
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And then there was another teenage camp, young adults camp there. And this was a big thing.

209
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And so I was always taught that respect. And there was also sort of a technology.

210
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, it's got some good things, but it's got some limitations too. So we also had that.

211
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And when I got here at Oregon State University, it was the campus ministries that were challenging higher education.

212
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There's a guy John Connor, you ought to just do a separate history on John Connor.

213
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And because he probably did more to change Oregon State University than any other person here. He was a campus minister at Westminster House.

214
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And we would have classes there and on environmental problems and appropriate technology was a big thing.

215
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And there were some economics theories. Kenneth Bolding and Herman Daley, Dick Clinton, if you interview him, he'll tell you about Herman Daley.

216
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And academia just sort of closed that stuff off.

217
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And at the time in the late 60s and early 70s, it was pretty exciting.

218
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
There was a lot of interesting things that were happening. But that movement died out.

219
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And again, it's sort of been airbrushed out of the history. And I think this is one of the things that's probably important for oral history.

220
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Because a lot of historians, they study the archives. Well, the stuff that may be most important didn't make it into the archives.

221
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Because the big institutions basically don't fund that. And so it sort of disappears.

222
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So we need to have people take oral history and say, look, here's some good stuff.

223
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And it makes a lot of sense. Kenneth Bolding, Herman Daley.

224
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I mean, you go back, E.F. Schumacher, small as beautiful. I mean, these were books that came in books of writings and speeches that were amazing.

225
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Kenneth Bolding is one of the best speakers I heard on an economist. And he studied terribly.

226
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And you'd sit there and you'd first be nervous. And then you'd realize that it doesn't bother him. So it didn't bother you.

227
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It was amazing. And it came up with some really good stuff. I think if we were to know how to deal with some of the environmental problems we have now, go back and look at them.

228
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And Kenneth Bolding was a quaker. Herman Daley, I think, was a Methodist, E.F. Schumacher, Catholic.

229
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:58,000
This was a spiritual movement, but it was, it was certain, it had nothing to do with intelligent design or evolution or anything like that.

230
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It was never an issue. And so that's a part of the history. If people want to understand where we're at now, I think, you can go back and say there were some opportunities that were missed that happened.

231
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll come back to some of those.

232
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, tell me about the decision to come to OSU in 1967. You'd graduated from NYU and you came here.

233
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, I don't think I singled out OSU for any reason. In fact, I had applied to EPA. And they were going to hire me. And Tom Baumgartner was over EPA.

234
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And the hire me on beautification, study of lakes. And also, the story. Tom was a story. Anyhow, aquatic ecosystems.

235
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And somehow that position fell through. So he sent my resume over to Fred Burgers, who was the Dean of Engineering.

236
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And I got this notice. You know, would you like a position here? So I said, yeah. So I took it.

237
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What was your first impression of the university and of the town?

238
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Well, I liked it. I really, you know, it's a beautiful campus. And it still is. I mean, it's, I mean, it has a few ugly beliefs.

239
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I mean, generally, I think it's a fantastic campus. The people were good, friendly. So I enjoyed it.

240
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What was the department like?

241
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The department was a good department. It was a traditional engineering department. But I did have some, some certain amount of freedom.

242
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I started a course on mathematical modeling, computer simulation. And you look back. And that was a pretty big jump for a lot of the people back then.

243
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because the digital computer was fairly new, except the military, of course. And so I had a course there.

244
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I also had a course, a graduate course got on the books that was something like a philosophy of technology.

245
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So they, you know, they were receptive to this. And I think my education and VMI helped a little bit because, you know, if I felt strongly about something, I told them so.

246
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I think most people appreciated that. At least they knew that I wasn't going to back off because I was afraid of raising something unusual. They didn't even occur to me.

247
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So I did get some courses taught then. And at that time, I had the mightest touch. I could get research grants. I mean, I was just, you know, I couldn't believe it.

248
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Now they weren't big grants like you get now. I had, I had, on estuaries, I had one. And then I had, you know, a multiplication as it lakes. What happens to lakes? It was a computer simulation. And I got that.

249
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And I had another interesting one. And we'll talk a little more about that. And that was environmental strategies under indeterminacy. I think that's what the title was. And they even funded that one. It was a small grant.

250
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But then the strange things happened. As my awareness started to expand, the funding agency started to go narrower.

251
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And by the end of the 70s, things have changed. Things have really changed. What do you think happened?

252
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well, that's a good story. And that's the one the historians have to look at. Now there are some historians here.

253
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Army Mother Nature, Jacob Darwin, Hamlin, great name, Jacob Darwin, I love it. He's written a very good book. And it's about how the environmental movement or the environmental science more, environmental science.

254
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Particularly big computer models came out of the military. And I didn't know that at that time. But my background was out of the sanitary engineering.

255
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So it was a whole different background. And what happened is their way of doing it took over. And the way we were doing it shrunk.

256
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And so what they were saying is, well, we'll build big computer models. I'm simplifying it.

257
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And that's how we'll approach the future. Well, I was in a computer model. And I said, you can't do, I mean, yeah, build computer models.

258
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But you cannot have environmental strategies based on prediction and control. The world is too complex.

259
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And so what we did during this study, what I did during this study, environmental strategies under indeterminacy.

260
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I said, look, we have a strategy. It's very simple. You don't need big models. You could build big models, but you need a strategy. And the strategy is we will make mistakes.

261
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay, that's called confession. Okay. And so what you have to do is learn how to make good mistakes. And a good mistake is, say, reversible.

262
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Good mistakes are ones you learn from. Good mistakes are ones where you don't get painted in a box. So we came up with a strategy like this.

263
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And it all made very good sense. And it does to this day. I mean, you take carbon dioxide, the greenhouse war.

264
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:26,000
People still trying to predict their models are all over the place if you go far out. But the CO2 impact is almost irreversible. And it's just shooting through the sky.

265
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So under that strategy, we would have said, you got to stop. You can't wait till you find out what the impacts are. It's too late. The world is changing faster than you can develop your predictions.

266
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So I thought it all made sense. So they send, when I write my file report in 78, and I got a copy of it.

267
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:01,000
They send the guy out there to look over my shoulder while I'm writing it. This is strange. That never happened before.

268
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And I thought maybe it was because when the Senator Proxmire is Golden Fleece Awards, he would ridicule scientific projects.

269
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But I realize now after some of the history books coming out, the paradigms were changing. They were saying we want big scale computer models. And I was in the modeling booth.

270
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So the guy looked over my shoulder and said, okay. And I thought he was pleased with the report. When he was. But when he left, he said, we'll never fund anything like this again.

271
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I go, why? I was shocked. We don't have a box to put it in. This is the answer. Now I didn't realize at that time that that's what the transformation was occurring.

272
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You're building big boxes. So you have all these little specialized areas to do certain tasks to fit into the models.

273
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And we weren't looking at this. Now one of the guys I worked with on here is Scott Overton. Did you interview Scott? No. It's a shame. He passed away.

274
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But there is a website. You really ought to take a look at it. Very impressive guy. And Scott and I probably at Oregon State between the two of us at the time.

275
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We published a paper in 72. We probably had more environmental computer modeling than any other to it in the university.

276
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And we basically came up with a strategy that was not based on prediction and control. And avoid large scale irreversible change.

277
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You have to do that because you don't know what the consequences are. Be so when you make a mistake, you want to make a good mistake, which means you can reverse it.

278
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
CO2 doesn't reverse. I mean, it's up there for centuries. It's sad.

279
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Tell me about Overton. Overton, Scott Overton, statistics and forest management. And Scott, he was very disciplined. In fact, there were people in statistics. I think they were afraid of him.

280
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And a good guy. Very thoughtful person. Very rigorous. Very rigorous. And he was a few years old in my I was. He was a scouting war work too, I think.

281
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And how you can look up his background and statistics and forest management. And he just was good. So we got together and we started talking about this.

282
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We said, let's write a paper on it. And it was published in the American Society Civil Engineers, sanitary engineering division. It really wasn't.

283
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The environmental science was his sort of, well, was it really out there? Scott had a student, Larry Hunt. And I think early 70s he did his PhD. And he had to do it in forest management. There was no ecology. But it was in ecology, you know, PhD.

284
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We had a graduate faculty of ecology. We were sort of fighting the system. And during his one of his last meetings in marches of group of faculty from forest management, complaining that he didn't take the road design courses and the cable design all the stuff about logging.

285
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And well, he had a powerful committee and there was a dean of forestry. I think his name was Stonebird. And I have to give the guy credit. He picked up the body language of our committee that we were going to fight for this guy. And so he was very diplomatic, but he says, well, this time, we'll arrange this. So we got him through. So Larry Hunt was probably one of the first ones to actually get a PhD in ecology.

286
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So there were other people who had done things in biology, but it was generally, it's not like it is now. So that was interesting.

287
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about the climate on campus in the late 60s. Obviously was raging. There was a lot of tumult nationwide. What was your sense of the environment on campus itself?

288
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't think I think relative to other places there was probably less. But I think some of the inquiry sort of maybe lasted a little longer. So it's like some other places burn out quicker.

289
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:24,000
My contact was largely through the campus ministries. And they were really they were really active all the way into the 70s. In fact, even beyond that.

290
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I can remember having a course over in Westminster House. And so I knew the current of the ROTC, Kurt Rosler, I think, was his name. And he, I know this probably late 70s, I'm guessing.

291
00:40:45,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I may have the date off, but you can look up his pictures up there. And he was a tank commander. And so this is the Cold War. And during the Cold War, the Soviet tanks were, you know, I mean, the armed divisions, they were powerful. This was a major concern.

292
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So I brought him over to one of these classes. And there were a whole lot of what we called hippies. And in this class, and he just wore sweater casual to billion clothes. And he started talking with them. And they didn't want to like him. But they did.

293
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He was a good guy. And I remember asking him the question, what is more danger to American society? The Soviet tank or the American gas goes in the car. And he said, oh, that's easy. It's the car. And so I mean, we had those kinds of discussions that were going on.

294
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:11,000
They sort of ended late 80s. We put on a conference on Eisenhower's farewell address. He warns about the military industrial complex. But people don't realize he also warned about the university.

295
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The danger is that the pursuit of government grants and contracts will be pursued so much that intellectual curiosity will be given up.

296
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:42,000
We must guard against scientific technological lead. And then later after that, he says only uninformed and knowledgeable citizenry can can prevent this from happening. I mean, he has some powerful stuff. So we did a whole conference on that.

297
00:42:42,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And one of the things we did in that conference, Craig Walker, you can interview him. He's still there. He's got, he gave you a copy of the book. We did on it. He and I wrote a chapter at the end. And we said, suppose George Bush gave this con.

298
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because George Bush, the first George Bush was president then. And not George W. It was his George W's father. And so what we did is we took portions of the speech. And we just said, suppose George Bush wrote this.

299
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And the only thing will change is his warning is not about the military industrial complex is the oil industrial complex. And so we changed. And it's really a radical. It comes across really radical. Well, you can take that and take it for his son. You can take it and give that speech now. And he was warning. I mean, is it remarkable with Eisenhower's whole life was in the military industrial complex.

300
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And his final warning is warning about it. I was very impressed with that. And your sense was always you was falling prey to these warnings.

301
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, yeah, I think pursuit of research. It's not just over you, but I think higher education in general. I mean, pursuit of research. I'm a word graded when I was there research. I mean, I don't know whether anybody read the papers, but you sure how to put a list on how much money you brought in. I think that's pretty, pretty common right now.

302
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And so you bring in more money. And I said, this is strange. You know, we're being paid rewarded for spending more money. Why don't we say, look, gee, I did all this interesting stuff. And I didn't spend very much of the taxpayer's money. I mean, it seemed to me that would make sense.

303
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But it didn't work that way. So was the paper with over 10 and 72 is that sort of the beginning of the system's theory work?

304
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, the systems theory work. First of all, in the computer modeling and ecosystems, I was doing ecosystems. So I was involved in systems.

305
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And I was involved in some ecologist or limnologist, G. Evelyn Hutchinson. And there were a number of people, the beginning of ecology.

306
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So I had used some of their work, met some of those people. And I was coming at it. But I began to realize that the rivers aren't the problem.

307
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The trees aren't the problem. The fish aren't the problem. It's the human systems that are the problem.

308
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So I began to realize this in the 70s, maybe even a little before that. And so what I started doing was studying human systems.

309
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Now, if you're going to study human systems, you make a choice. I'm in a computer. So I can sit behind a computer. Of course, they didn't have the computer screens, but now, of course, they do.

310
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Or I can actually get out in the organizational systems and see what's happening. I chose that second round. And that was actually a conscious choice. I'm going to collect experiences.

311
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm not going to be sitting eventually once they got computer screens. I'm not going to be sitting behind a computer screen.

312
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So I never had email on campus. Never. Okay. Okay. Never. I have some at home now. Will Gamble, you can interview him. I don't know if he will.

313
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:01,000
He didn't either. So we were probably the last ones. But I'm working with these computer systems. Now, when you work with these computer systems, there's a whole level of mathematics today that you can do.

314
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So you can do a few linear dynamics emergence that you can't do with traditional mathematics. And you know, I can explain it. Take me about three for a minute. Explain it.

315
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Because I have to explain differential equations. But basically, you couldn't solve the equations. And what do you do with differential equations? You start out with initial condition. You tell the rates of change and then you can make a prediction.

316
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But with certain equations, nonlinear, particularly if they're say three dimensional. So you're going to see in space, you know, what the predictions are.

317
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You end up with the things going around like this. It's called chaos. And you end up with a essentially the world is just not that predictable. And then you're throwing complexity.

318
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And so over to the night were onto that 72. If you look up the references, one of them, I think the title had one plus one does not equal to that is the whole cannot be reduced to the sum of the parts.

319
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And the other one was a paper by Warren Weaver that basically said science doesn't know does not know how to deal with problems of organized complexity.

320
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I was into the math. Because with the digital computer, you can approximate the solution to equations that you cannot solve.

321
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So you don't solve them. You get finite difference numerical methods, approximations. That's what all the computer simulations are doing now. They don't solve the equations like they do in differential equations. They can't even come close.

322
00:48:47,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But the nonlinear behave in weird ways. I mean, the nonlinear world is bizarre and it's only bizarre because for several hundred years, we've been taught to think linearly.

323
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And when you're taught to think linearly, then when something nonlinear comes up, it seems bizarre. So I would meet with a guy, John Goldman.

324
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:30,000
He'd never get a chance to be a good one to interview. He was a campus minister here. And the best description of John is he's a medieval monk transported by a time machine.

325
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So he'd never pass through the analytical age of say Newton and Galileo, the analysis breaking it down into parts. He thought holistically, you know, and he didn't have any trouble with this.

326
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We had these discussions for years. For students, we just common people would come and we'd have these discussions.

327
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And so the nonlinear world is a strange world. It's a world that requires you to think more with the right hemisphere of your brain.

328
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Ian McGillcrest has a great video. People should look that up. The divided brain. And he says the left hemisphere is sequential linear. And we have become dominated by left brain thinking.

329
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I think that's true. And he describes what would happen, what kind of organization would you get if it was dominated by left hemisphere? And he describes, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a university.

330
00:50:40,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So the right hemisphere system, the world is so amazing. There's things emerge. And anyhow, that's the stuff I got into. But I wanted to get into it from a human perspective, big organizations.

331
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I didn't want to stay in the mathematical modeling. I kept teaching. I had to make a living. I kept teaching the computer modeling. And I enjoyed it. I enjoyed teaching.

332
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But when I teach, even engineering mechanics, I almost never brought in notes. The class almost never interact with the students. And the best classes occurred when the course, the class went in the direction that I didn't even anticipate.

333
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I just got to keep my life. And then the eyes light up when they get something. It's great.

334
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It strikes me that you're placing a imperative on getting away from the computer screen and getting out and interacting with people. It falls the same while your father took it.

335
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Yeah, I think that's probably true. He really did. He majored in physics, which at that time, physics. I mean, because physics, that time was going through a huge change.

336
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And I brought him when he retired a pendulum and it has several magnets. So it's nonlinear. And it doesn't just swing back and forth. It just goes in this.

337
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And when he looked at that, his eyes lit up and he just laughed and he says, that would have driven my professors crazy.

338
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Yeah, I did that. It also sounds like there's a divergence between the curriculum that you're teaching or being compelled to teach in your research interests.

339
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Oh, I have an opposite direction.

340
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
If I take my career at Oregon State, I can put all my accomplishments in two piles.

341
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
A, that got me promotion and tenure. This full professor tenure, all the rest of this.

342
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
A, right over here.

343
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Pile B over here didn't go anywhere within your organization.

344
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Or, you know, not very, not very far. The most important pile is B. You can throw out all the rest.

345
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Now, I learned a lot by, say, teaching engineering mechanics. And you learn a lot, for example, in mechanics courses, the way we teach the math isn't that important.

346
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You have to teach students how to sketch. Make a sketch. It's called a free body diagram. Ask any student who's taking it, you have to draw it.

347
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So, how do you make a sketch? How do you think? How do you, how do you do that?

348
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And you engage the students in that, you know, making the simple sketches.

349
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So, when I went to study human systems, I'm going to make sketches.

350
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Because, you see, a sketch is two-dimensional.

351
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Okay? You know, it goes two-dimensional sketch.

352
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Now, you can make a three-dimensional. That's, that's, it's not too hard to go to three-dimensional.

353
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But going from one dimension, which is a written text, to two dimensions is a huge difference.

354
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's, it's just a huge difference. I mean, you, you can talk about something as perpendicular in two dimensions.

355
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And that means this dimension cannot be reduced to this dimension. They're orthogonal.

356
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
In one-dimensional lines of reasoning, you can't do that. I mean, you can sort of say it, but it just, you don't see it.

357
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So, the average, or typical book is what? About a half mile long. It's all one line. It's only arranged on pages for convenience.

358
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And so, that shapes the way we think. We think in lines. And, and the world does not behave in lines.

359
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,000
The world is much more in this way. Now, if you go on a construction site, I learned this my first job.

360
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They give you a set of specs, all lines written, and a set of drawings. I almost never looked at the specs.

361
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I was all over those drawings. And if you go out on the construction site, watch construction on campus.

362
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And you'll see people using body language. You'll see them taking out diagrams. They're not sitting around studying texts.

363
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Professors do that. They could never build a building like that.

364
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Well, I'm wondering if the system's theory, I mean, my impression anyway, it could be wrong about this, but it was sort of kind of the spine of your work in them.

365
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And that went off in a lot of different kind of more topical directions or kind of current events, e-types, directions. Is that true?

366
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Well, my work, I finally, a lot of the work in systems now is going highly sophisticated mathematics. And the study of emergence, for example, one of the best people of biology is Stuart Kaufman.

367
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And he's done randomized Boolean networks. He did some things that's mathematical. And it's pretty good. So, you know, I've done some of that.

368
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But I go, what's the point in all the math? I mean, if we're trying to understand the world that people are living in, then we ought to be able to communicate to them.

369
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Because they know more about that world than we do. So, what I do is I make sketches.

370
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And you make sketches. And now I'll do like ten statements on a sketch. And simple statements connected by arrows. So they loop.

371
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And I'll get people, if I can get them to read it, the people who read it and I go, you just describe my life. This is what's going on.

372
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So, one of them that I did was how information gets distorted in organizations. The classic example explanation we give is blame.

373
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Look at the Veterans Administration. Okay, information was distorted. So, what do they do? They fire Eric Shinseki.

374
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I mean, he's got to be one of the most honest straightforward guys you can imagine. I mean, he's an honorable person. And I mean that, in the best sense of the word.

375
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And you listen to Congress and there, everybody's blaming everybody. So, what I did is I made a simple sketch. And how organization is a system.

376
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And it provides a context within which everybody finds reasons to behave in their own particular way. But the system is a whole distorts information. Okay, that's what I do.

377
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And that everybody inside of it has a good reason. And they're ordinary people like us. So I've done that.

378
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I did a video about the original one in the late 70s. And first I didn't publish it but the model sort of circulated. People would send me. I got a zero ox of a zero ox. Can you send me a copy?

379
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,519
So then in 86 I think it was the shuttle blew up and

380
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:38,000
I'm watching television and I see Richard Feynman and

381
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:45,199
He's trying to explain what's going on on echo. He's describing my model. I never studied NASA

382
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:52,320
So I send them a copy of the diagram and this table and I didn't know he was dying a stomach cancer

383
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,320
I think was not a cancer at the time. I

384
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,920
Wish I would have I would have

385
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,880
Thank them. You know, so if you want to thank someone thank him quick

386
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,880
When they die he can't

387
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
I'll do it now. Thanks, Richard

388
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,039
Okay, and he read it and he wrote me back this letter and

389
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:14,480
He says I read this table and I'm amazed

390
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:17,880
Perfect prediction. No, I don't use perfect prediction

391
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,840
But if you're Richard Feynman, you can use Richard, you know, you can use perfect prediction

392
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,160
And he says I didn't realize that NASA was part of a general phenomena

393
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:34,840
Technically if I said that we say that's a grammatical era a phenomena if Richard Feynman says it it's brilliant

394
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:41,440
Okay, so then I started publishing it now next month August

395
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,720
I'll be going to Quebec City for the American Fisheries Society to present this model

396
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:54,599
Okay, and I got to figure out how to do it on a PowerPoint now because there's going to be 2500 people and I've got

397
00:59:55,319 --> 01:00:01,119
half an hour so that that's a little I like to interact but you don't interact with 2500 people

398
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:08,959
So anyhow, I draw these models and when people can understand them and they see it

399
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:16,399
Then they can start telling you because they know more about the experience in the world and I do

400
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:22,000
They can start telling you and to a large extent what I'm doing is I'm providing an alternative to blame

401
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,360
Looking at these larger systems

402
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,680
Now it's consistent with a lot of the mathematics that's going on it's just that

403
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
You can experience it in life

404
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:41,519
And if the world is non-linear and emerging we are experiencing it because we have to open up our eyes

405
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:48,199
When one looks at sort of an abstract of your Vita there are

406
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:55,480
There are issues there mostly in the past now and I'm wondering if what you've just described as if these are examples of it

407
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,960
Having been that model haven't been applied in the past of things like space-based weaponry

408
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,480
Yeah, I will see I

409
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,960
That's an interesting I

410
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:08,159
About the 1980s

411
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:14,039
Some were 1980s. I was really getting frustrated with the environmental because you know

412
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:18,940
That's about the time that they started the global warming we will make predictive models and

413
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:23,920
Scientists may say well, we really weren't no, no, that's the way the objectives were written

414
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:31,039
I went back and looked at the original documents and we'll develop predictive models and I said now you know

415
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:36,599
I just you know so I got frustrated so I wanted to learn more about

416
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:45,460
Large-scale computer systems and that cannot I understand organizations by just observing so I went and I spent six years

417
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,719
Ronald Reagan Star Wars program and I had no funding

418
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:56,719
so I could go to the meetings and I didn't have to hustle any money and

419
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:03,839
Oh, you go to these meetings and you know these consultants there. They're always have to hustle money and

420
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:12,920
And so I could ask these these questions and I said I want to see if I can as a citizen if I can

421
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:20,800
Find something make a contribution here to something that they don't see and I did finds I did I could and

422
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:23,519
That's a whole other story and

423
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:30,600
Involves some interesting characters including Richard Cheney who was Secretary Defense at the time

424
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:37,519
So and Richard Garwin who designed the hydrogen bomb interesting really interesting guy

425
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:47,519
So I met some interesting people and I did some interesting things but I was mainly interested in the human systems and how

426
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:55,239
And then the large scale technological ones and how you we can lose control. I mean the control is sort of

427
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,079
often in illusion

428
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:05,519
You referenced earlier John Connor and Westminster House and the local environmental movement you want to talk more about him and in that period of time

429
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,119
Yeah, John Connor was a campus minister

430
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:15,860
He had been a minister in Mexico. Turns out he I found out years later that he

431
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:20,559
He moved my cousin in Raton. I think it was Raton in Mexico and

432
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,319
Anyhow John was

433
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,320
Was very tall and I had this long beard and

434
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:38,280
He'd he just would raise all sorts of questions. He raised all sorts of questions. He'd just be bouncing around and

435
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,519
he sort of stir up the pot and

436
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
We at that particular time

437
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
There was a whole national movement

438
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,960
were

439
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,960
Theology or mainline churches

440
01:03:56,199 --> 01:04:03,840
With challenging higher education. There's a book on it Douglas Sloan from Columbia University. It's called faith in knowledge and

441
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:13,119
Probably out of print now, but it's very good book and they they were challenging higher education

442
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:21,599
And what Sloan writes about is everyone on for about two decades and Eisenhower's warning is sort of right in the middle of that

443
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,679
So there was a time in there where where people are

444
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,920
Looking at the problems of technology

445
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:35,839
Yes, it has good things what we have to recognize as limitations to there was sort of this attitude

446
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,679
So John played a key role in that and he was

447
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:47,239
Mainly the facilitator of he became moderator of the

448
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:51,559
Presbyterian Church which is I guess their highest position

449
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:54,599
and

450
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:56,719
He he would

451
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,799
You know, he did a lot of interesting things, but for me

452
01:05:01,719 --> 01:05:05,639
It was like he was sort of at the focal point of a

453
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Center of the whirlwind

454
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
We're all interesting things were happening

455
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,319
and

456
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:17,960
So that was very important time and there were concepts that came up then

457
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,920
Very very important

458
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,960
I wrote a paper

459
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,960
published it

460
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,799
2006 on evil

461
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Well, this was a

462
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,480
It's a secular germ. I mean it's it's on emergency levels the title of it and I

463
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:44,599
used concepts from

464
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,440
Theology in there and no one no one raised any concern was you know

465
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:57,159
They were helping us to understand this this phenomena and basically I was saying that

466
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:05,039
Evil large patterns emerge and ordinary people like you and I get caught up within them and

467
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:09,039
In biblical language that would be bondage and blindness

468
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:11,679
you're caught up within it and

469
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,240
You can't transcend it

470
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:18,559
The context the system that that you're caught up within and

471
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:25,479
Harble things could be done and the example I use was a Soviet biological warfare system and

472
01:06:27,439 --> 01:06:30,759
Harble horrible things and by some tough scientists

473
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,479
So scientists can get caught up in it just like anybody else

474
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:41,639
Anyhow that you know that probably has goes back in some ways to John Connor

475
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:46,799
It's interesting how often you've been working with church groups

476
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:53,400
I'm on the French is the French church groups. I you know, I I don't go regularly to

477
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,559
services

478
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,039
They're see part of it. I'm studying models well

479
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:06,839
I learned models as a kid they were called parables a

480
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,840
Parable is a model all models are simplifications and

481
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:21,680
What they do is help to clarify some matters of importance not all and they expose their limitations

482
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:29,019
Okay, so a parable is a story and what you do is you get engaged in the power you learn

483
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:34,039
And as you're

484
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:39,679
Going through life you begin ah you mean to see something and

485
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:44,239
That's what the purpose of a good model really is

486
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:51,039
That you play with it you engage and then it allows you to become aware of something

487
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,800
And it's very different than having a big computer that no one knows what it's doing and it spits out data

488
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,079
So in that sense what I was involved in was

489
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,679
Had its roots they're in parables, but also in engineering

490
01:08:08,279 --> 01:08:09,639
You know

491
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:15,239
Scientists act like all this stuff that we build here all this stuff comes out of science

492
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Okay, and

493
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:28,880
I would say yes, but I taught engineering mechanics this is Newtonian mechanics when engineers build

494
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,880
Like the buildings on campus just go watch them. They're amazing. They build them on campus

495
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,640
We also use safety factors

496
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:48,920
And we don't talk about students don't know about this and word safety factors come from they come from confession and repentance

497
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:57,640
Now confession and repentance is an amyle awful. It's not self-blame. It means you've done something and there's a failure

498
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:01,039
What are you gonna do?

499
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:05,000
You admit to the failure and you change your ways and

500
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,600
That's how you learn that's how you learn how to ride a bike

501
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,520
You don't study bicycle riding the theory of bicycle riding and pass a quiz a multiple grade

502
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,680
You know a multiple choice quiz and say now I'm a bike rider you get on it and you fall down

503
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,640
That's how life is and so in engineering civil engineering in particular if you look at the history

504
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:33,360
You see all these pictures of bridges that fell down you'd be gonna say what what's going on here? That's how we learn and

505
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,240
There's a historian

506
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:46,720
Engineering and he has some statements. He I read one the other day behind every almost every success is a history of failure something like this

507
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,160
Well, that's probably pretty good theology too

508
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:55,400
So there's been a whole part it's not about belief systems

509
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:58,519
And even churches get that wrong

510
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:05,019
You know the word belief is a modern word you know the word religion even I mean

511
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:13,359
It didn't you know it's a new word. I mean new in the last 700 years as a system of beliefs. It just doesn't make sense

512
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:17,439
So what you learn were stories and

513
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:22,759
Powerboats and you went out into the world and you made mistakes guess what?

514
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,940
So that's how you learn so

515
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,119
When I come back to some stuff that I learned in church and stuff that I learned in

516
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,920
engineering and stuff that I

517
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,119
Learn in environment

518
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:39,119
There are some common themes

519
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:49,400
Now what's absent is some of this foolishness like intelligent design or things like this and this this this is just a big distraction

520
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,159
I mean

521
01:10:53,039 --> 01:11:01,360
I mean John Connor had no problem with evolution my father didn't now maybe his father maybe did but a lot of people did things change

522
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,320
So I've sort of been on the fringe of some

523
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,920
some I

524
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,199
Guess you call theological insights

525
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,199
That's pretty cool. There's some interesting ones and

526
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,320
They're not about belief systems and one of one of the things you find now, for example is

527
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,880
how

528
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,880
Buddhism and Christianity have

529
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:34,039
Parts of it just sort of come together and rediscovered each other and you take a guy like Richard Ruror who's a

530
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Franciscan Catholic and

531
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,239
He will talk about the Dalai Lama

532
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,480
I mean this is like

533
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,520
The boxes we put people in it just doesn't make sense

534
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,320
Yeah

535
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:01,560
Tell me about the swallowed camel club. Oh the swallowed camel club. Okay. Okay the swallowed camel club

536
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,159
We had a group that this is spontaneously

537
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,760
Many years ago

538
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:15,320
First of the library and we were making almost too much noise and and

539
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,119
So we so we started meeting over at

540
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:32,760
St. Anson's is a Piscobo campus ministry because John Connor our time John Goldman was John Goldman and he's the guy that's this medieval monk and

541
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,239
We were

542
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:38,920
people were we'd raise certain questions and say I

543
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,039
Say well, are you getting this in your classes?

544
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:49,199
So if you really want to find out what's being taught you have to ask the students

545
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:56,479
Ask the students so this stuff on complexity and all the rest these big scale systems

546
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:04,319
Those you know, they're not addressing all things not really not in a way that registers with the students

547
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:08,639
I mean the student okay

548
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:13,359
So we've had these discussions so what are we gonna call our group?

549
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:16,639
Well, there's an ancient criticism of

550
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,440
University professors

551
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,520
You blind guides you strain out a net and swallow a camel

552
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:31,200
Okay, it's gospel St Matthew, okay, and it's right hemisphere

553
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,000
It's got a metaphor blind guide you strain out a net swallow a camel

554
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,200
Three metaphors it that's the right and and he puts them together in irony and humor and

555
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:49,119
Yet people go yeah, so obviously a camel is not the sum of a lot of little nets

556
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:56,599
So it's not linear so anyhow we we would laugh and sort of the joke we call it the small camel club and

557
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,840
We're not meeting this summer and

558
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:05,359
It's it's going on pretty strong the last several months though. We've

559
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,199
You know, we've sort of dropped off in part of it. I've been working on some other stuff and

560
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,840
Part John Goldman has retired

561
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,639
Piscillate churches going through some changes. So I'm not sure where it's gonna go

562
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:24,920
But it has gone on for years and there's still I got a email list of 30 40 people who would

563
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:27,479
belong to it

564
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:29,479
I send it out

565
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,920
Did you have any contact with Catherine Jeffers?

566
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,199
Story yeah, a little bit of contact with Catherine Jeffers. Sure

567
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:40,639
And Dick Shore he was a math master husband and non-linear

568
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:46,319
Dynamics but not much on this not not much on this

569
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:55,159
She's done a you know an outstanding job and certainly on making the piss I'm not a pissing paling

570
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:57,159
But making the

571
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:04,439
Gays and Lesbians and she's really done that and had to

572
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:11,399
Fight some battles and she does it very very graciously very graciously. I

573
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,399
Would say I'd love to get she also has a PhD in oceanography

574
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:23,119
I would also be fun to have in conversation with

575
01:15:26,759 --> 01:15:29,000
Marcus Borg and I believe on Marcus Borg

576
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:37,800
Because I would be a little more questioning of science than I think they are. It's not that science is back

577
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,600
It's just that

578
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:45,239
There's a lot of specialization and a lot of claims

579
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:48,199
Those wonderful things

580
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,520
But not everything

581
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:53,159
And

582
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,159
We could have an interesting discussion

583
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:01,479
I want to ask you about a couple kind of bullet points from your beta the past research interests that I think have

584
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:07,399
Particular book ability to people in this state the first one is an issue that's been important to folks

585
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:11,319
My set of state needs an organ that's destruction of chemical weapons. Oh, yeah

586
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:14,599
That's an interesting story

587
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,920
So I got invited on this one. I actually got paid for this this one

588
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,439
You know I'm not a whole lot, but a lot of the work I did I didn't get paid for it

589
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:25,399
And I make my living teaching

590
01:16:27,559 --> 01:16:29,319
The United States had millions of

591
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:35,639
Literally millions and millions of chemical munitions stored all over

592
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:44,599
And I mean they say their weapons, but most of them are not usable and one of them for example the M55 rocket

593
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:49,079
They made half a million of it. It's about a seven foot rocket

594
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,079
six-semin

595
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:58,199
And it's not guided and they don't even have launchers and the thing I think tends to go like this

596
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:03,559
So they got all these these rockets. Well, what are you gonna do with them?

597
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,399
And they got they have the warheads with the

598
01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:10,119
chemical agent

599
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:11,800
inside of it

600
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,800
So you've got like a liquid and you've got a birch there because it's an aerosol

601
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,760
So I'm not really a gas and then you got all the booster rocket and they've riveted

602
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,520
The the warheads on so they can't just unscrew them

603
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:29,800
So they have to get rid of them. So I was part of a

604
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,760
Independent team to review the risk analysis

605
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,360
and

606
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:41,720
Because they want to know whether they should ship off site or

607
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,280
Historic on site and

608
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,520
incineration all the rest of this

609
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:51,720
Well one of the things I looked at was the M55 rocket and they had these

610
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,119
big steel insulated containers to transport them in

611
01:17:57,079 --> 01:17:59,079
hey

612
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:01,079
And they had on wood pallets

613
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:09,480
So I don't know they might have had 15 on a pallet and two pallets might 30 so they you know 15 or 30 inside when these big

614
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:13,879
And they had tests so they could drop it from 20 feet

615
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:16,679
And if there's a fire could insulate

616
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:19,399
They went through all these accident scenarios

617
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:26,919
Well the way they do risk analysis is they break it down into different little what's the probability of this

618
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:32,679
Assign somebody this job what's the probability of this and they put them all together to find the probability

619
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:37,879
Of an accident occurring which requires maybe three or four or five different things happening

620
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
Okay, so it's a low probability

621
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:48,199
And they a lot of this stuff to have to pull out in the air like what's the probability of an airplane crashing into one of these

622
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,760
Igles or the storage bins well they have to figure out how many planes crashing and pulling out of the air

623
01:18:56,199 --> 01:19:00,039
So the one I came up with is

624
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:05,319
Okay, what happens to the rockets if there is a train wreck

625
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:09,719
Well, don't worry is the word ahead

626
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,319
You know we checked the warhead on this thing and well and

627
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:16,920
Worried won't go off. I said, I'm not worried about that

628
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:21,799
What do you worry about? I'm worried about the rocket igniting

629
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,159
Inside

630
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:28,679
And it turns out that when they set up the system

631
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:31,479
They didn't put a box for that

632
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:34,599
so

633
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,200
Oh, that won't happen that won't happen that's they go that that won't happen

634
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,320
So you go to meeting and when they say oh that won't happen

635
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:46,680
Wait for the coffee break wait for the coffee break because then somebody comes up

636
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,880
Why don't you go check? I've heard this they say this

637
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,160
So anyhow, I end up in Toelle, Utah

638
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,280
and they're gonna go in on a tour

639
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,480
Of the incineration

640
01:19:59,799 --> 01:20:05,079
But you have to word cast mask and they wouldn't mean to shave my beard and say I don't want to shave my beard

641
01:20:05,479 --> 01:20:08,119
So we'll leave you out here. We'll just leave you with this guy

642
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:11,559
That's good. They leave you with somebody

643
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:15,719
This guy tests these these warheads

644
01:20:16,919 --> 01:20:19,479
very ingenious design of the warhead

645
01:20:20,599 --> 01:20:22,839
You know a fuse the fuse

646
01:20:23,799 --> 01:20:25,799
but in the process I learned

647
01:20:26,759 --> 01:20:27,959
that

648
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,960
But I was concerned is

649
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:32,760
Inside the if you have a crash

650
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:35,720
In all these rockets start smashing around

651
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,800
Then you take steel and you bend it

652
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:42,439
It gives off heat

653
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:46,600
So is it possible that in the twisting of the metal

654
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:53,880
You'll get enough heat to ignite the rocket because all the rocket really is is solid booster inside a steel tube

655
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,520
And is a slow explosion

656
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,240
The gas goes out the bottom

657
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,440
So

658
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,560
So I had done some calculations rough calculations

659
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,440
How much heat would be given off the punctured steel casing

660
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,720
And then how much temperature would rise in the steel right around it

661
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,320
And compared that to the ignition temperature of the rocket and

662
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,440
It was higher

663
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,120
So

664
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,120
If you would say oh there's no data on that

665
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:27,159
Well they say there's no data just

666
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,800
Sort of you know that may be

667
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,840
You know we've never seen the data or we've never collected the data or it doesn't mean that

668
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,079
There shouldn't be

669
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,920
Anyhow I find out that to this guy and I get the field notes

670
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:44,840
That they test these rockets by dropping

671
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:48,039
20 them

672
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,680
And three of them ignited

673
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,840
Three of them ignited

674
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,600
And I heard some stories about them trying to test the warhead

675
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,079
You know so they get a guy to shoot a rifle at the warhead

676
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,360
And sometimes he misses and hits the rocket and shivers

677
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,880
The rocket takes off

678
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,320
But they didn't have a box to put this in

679
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,440
So they get the number

680
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,960
3

681
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,440
Out of 20 so you get a probability

682
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,400
3 out of 20

683
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,600
He is like

684
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:21,800
3 by 20 and I said I've seen that number before

685
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,560
Because I go through all these calculations sheets

686
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,280
And I come and I find that number and they say all that's the probability of

687
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,880
A warhead going out my pocket police

688
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,680
It gives a reference. I look up this reference

689
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:44,039
And what happened is everybody started referencing everybody else and what started out as a rocket ignition

690
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,600
Ended up as the warhead

691
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,600
Got on

692
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,360
Okay

693
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,160
And of course if it's the rocket igniting

694
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,800
And there's 15 or 30 other rockets inside a steel container

695
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,120
You've got a bomb

696
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,880
Because they can only hold like three rockets igniting

697
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,480
So we pointed out that to them

698
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,000
So that was that was kind of interesting because

699
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,160
It illustrates that

700
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,960
The science that gets done

701
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,720
Depends to a large extent on how the organization

702
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,960
Of it is structured and funded

703
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,880
And if everybody says gee that's an interesting idea, but it's not my job

704
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,240
That means it's not being done

705
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,760
Everybody has a good reason why they're not doing it

706
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,880
But what happens is

707
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
The organizational structure in a sense can

708
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,600
And

709
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,279
Direct us

710
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:48,920
Ask certain questions and not do other questions

711
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,640
And then when those questions come up

712
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:53,960
occasionally

713
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,960
People can just dismiss us on my job

714
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,880
So we better change the organization. That's not my job. The organization is too big. I can't change it

715
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:05,000
And so what happens is the problems continue

716
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:09,960
Now fortunately they've managed to get rid of all the M 55 rockets

717
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:15,640
They did not transport them. So we got the right decision. You know, we we brought that and

718
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:18,439
how much of my

719
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:27,800
Response that we wrote it up and how much of it survived through the bureaucratic process some of it did some of it didn't so

720
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:30,840
I don't know but it was fascinating

721
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:34,199
I learned a lot about risk analysis

722
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:37,319
So an organizational structure

723
01:24:37,559 --> 01:24:46,439
So they're they're doing a good job and I mean they had to get incinerated because these these rockets

724
01:24:48,519 --> 01:24:51,639
They put a stabilizer in them, but if that stabilizer

725
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:55,799
Degrades and they think it does I mean those rockets go off

726
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:00,359
And they're all stored together. That's not that's not good

727
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,319
They had literally millions of millions of

728
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:08,679
Initial so when you read in the paper of the Soviet Union and the United States

729
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,960
arguing

730
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,799
About who's you know have the weapons and so forth

731
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:20,840
What they should have been saying was here you take him. No, you take him. No, I don't want him you take him

732
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:24,920
I mean they were they were billion dollar problem

733
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:27,719
Okay, potential disaster

734
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:30,119
and

735
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:32,680
Yeah, that was interesting. Yeah, so what other bullet?

736
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,800
I want to ask about salmon the idea of salmon parks. Oh, yeah salmon

737
01:25:38,519 --> 01:25:44,680
Well, I've worked a lot with fisheries biologist and largely because once I started studying these human systems

738
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:50,760
I think it I didn't get research grants so I don't have travel money. So salmon's a local woman

739
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,000
We had some very fine people here

740
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,840
And salmon

741
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,319
So the American fisheries society back in

742
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:04,920
2005 they published it in 2006, but somewhere before then they basically said

743
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:10,759
We've been trying we've been trying to protect wild salmon and

744
01:26:12,279 --> 01:26:16,119
We spent billions of dollars and it's not working

745
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:25,960
So we want to select 33 people from out the country and even maybe outside the country

746
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,920
But but mainly

747
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:31,399
Canada and the United States

748
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,319
Northwest

749
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:37,079
What would you do? So totally free to say what would you do?

750
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:42,119
And so I was one

751
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:49,159
So Bob Lacky he's he's over there in political science and fisheries. He was he was the

752
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:52,359
Director and Denise Locke

753
01:26:52,759 --> 01:26:54,759
I was on it and

754
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:57,719
so

755
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:01,239
So Bob so they framed the problem

756
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:10,519
The problem is how do we have significant numbers of wild salmon by the year 2100 and then he had four policy

757
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:14,039
guides and one of them

758
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:19,159
Four policy drivers

759
01:27:19,559 --> 01:27:21,559
okay

760
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,800
Something right name

761
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,800
and one of them was

762
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,160
People are going to have to change their preferences

763
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,240
Or their values or preferences

764
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,240
So I went through the whole thing and I basically

765
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,720
concluded that the way they framed the problem you can't sell the problem

766
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,680
Okay, we're not gonna sell

767
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:53,640
And the besides the problem numbers of wild salmon that's not the real problem the problem is what kind of world do we want to leave

768
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,680
future generations

769
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:02,520
And the whole business about preferences I said no we're gonna get outcomes that no one prefers

770
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,680
so

771
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,680
So what I did is I

772
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,600
Reframed the problem now that's kind of like you're being given a test

773
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:16,280
And you go in and you decide I can't answer this question so I'm gonna change the question and I'm supposed to do that

774
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:21,640
So but I did it and I got to give them credit they kept the paper in there

775
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,360
so

776
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:32,200
Basically what I had to do is I thought it would be real easy. I'll just say wild salmon national park

777
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,480
That's what we need

778
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:42,760
But I in order to do that I had to challenge all the ways that we're thinking which are linear ways of thinking

779
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,720
Now wild salmon national park is doable

780
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:54,440
We have all sorts of agencies doing all sorts of things like the Corps of Engineers sits mitigation sites

781
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,440
We don't even know where they are

782
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:02,760
Okay, if you pull that money together and you could buy up

783
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:10,920
Particularly high flood prone areas which are the best habitats all way throughout the whole north west

784
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,079
And you would have a distributed wild salmon national park

785
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,000
Okay, even through cities they people want their waterfronts

786
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,079
So you know it wouldn't be

787
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:26,600
total of natural systems, but and there are a whole sorts of flood zones and and

788
01:29:28,119 --> 01:29:33,239
You look at the land of river and you see all these different twists and turns and

789
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,199
The farmers have trouble farming there because they flood

790
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,559
Well, plan all these weeds, but they call weeds which

791
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:46,519
And biologists called in natural floor. Okay, it's really funny

792
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:53,159
And if you look at the people who are studying floods and they map out high flood prone areas and

793
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,760
Gee, we got to prevent development do something about that

794
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:03,159
And then you go over to the wildlife biologist and take their maps of ideal habitat and they almost overlap

795
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:06,039
So it's a no-brainer, okay

796
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:10,760
Why don't we just buy some of this land and and and pay the people

797
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:14,519
You know not to build there rather than putting concrete or

798
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:18,119
Rock rip wrap along the banks because it made a road

799
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:22,920
So I went through a whole bunch of those things and I basically found that

800
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:25,960
Yeah, we could have a wild salmon national park

801
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:32,279
Wait, and it would run right through different parts of the whole Pacific Northwest

802
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:34,439
and

803
01:30:34,839 --> 01:30:38,279
Try and let the salmon come back and let the salmon guys

804
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:43,479
The biggest resistance seemed to come from the science and

805
01:30:44,759 --> 01:30:48,919
It wasn't about the science everybody agreed we have to protect habitat

806
01:30:49,639 --> 01:30:53,159
But they would say nobody's going to support that people don't prefer that

807
01:30:55,559 --> 01:30:57,559
Well

808
01:30:57,799 --> 01:30:59,799
Took that is it how do you know?

809
01:31:00,599 --> 01:31:01,639
Okay

810
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,640
First it's not about preferences

811
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,960
They amount of money

812
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:10,600
It's pittance I took the compared the the whole

813
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
National Park budget for that year

814
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,440
So I don't know

815
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,960
I may get the numbers wrong but five billion let's just say yeah, okay

816
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:28,520
And then I compared the bonuses given to Goldman Sachs one bank is like 20 billion

817
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:34,120
Okay as much big here's here's the national park the whole national marks here's the here's the

818
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:40,440
bonuses given to Goldman Sachs the year before the whole system crashed

819
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,720
Okay, I don't think the people even in Goldman Sachs think that that's makes sense

820
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,840
But you say oh people won't and then the same year

821
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,720
That we put finally published this

822
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,680
PBS did a special

823
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,600
American national parks America's best idea

824
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,640
So

825
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:10,280
Basically, I conclude that the reason we don't have that is because the institutions have framed the problem in pieces

826
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So everybody can say it's not my job

827
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,600
And then everybody can blame everybody else

828
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,960
And then everybody can focus on their little job

829
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,360
Now there is a guy you could be interesting to interview

830
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:25,719
I don't know

831
01:32:25,719 --> 01:32:29,479
David Lane because he did his PhD dissertation on brief framing

832
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:32,119
And he used the same in 2100

833
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,759
as his test case

834
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,960
And he's got brilliant idea

835
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,920
he basically said

836
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:49,000
If if there are environmental problems that we have not been able to solve we've probably framed the problem in the wrong way

837
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,119
It's like if I give an exam question to my engineering students

838
01:32:54,679 --> 01:33:00,199
And at the end of the exam period all my smart students are still trying to solve the problem. I'm in trouble

839
01:33:01,319 --> 01:33:03,880
Because I frame the problem in a way they can't solve

840
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:10,199
So what he wanted to do is to look back over the history and find

841
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,239
reframings

842
01:33:13,239 --> 01:33:19,479
Because we will lose them because the institutions frame the problem in a particular way

843
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:22,439
So if someone comes along and reframes it

844
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:27,079
Everybody may say it's a good idea but he gets lost in the institution

845
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:31,799
So he develops software to get indicators of reframing

846
01:33:31,799 --> 01:33:35,559
And he could have a software search through with these indicators

847
01:33:35,559 --> 01:33:42,359
To try to find a radical reframed and identify it and he used same in 2100 as an example

848
01:33:42,839 --> 01:33:47,239
And his indicators go like this and then my paper came out like this. That's how I got to know

849
01:33:48,519 --> 01:33:50,519
So he's working over there with

850
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,440
International students with English teaching English

851
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,960
I'm asking a couple more questions about OSU

852
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:05,080
Your your research interests in your contacts primary contacts. It seems we're pretty far field from

853
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,560
Traditional civil engineering

854
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,320
Did you ever feel isolated or like a man about a home on some level?

855
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,840
Yeah, you do sometimes the hardest thing over the years

856
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,800
People act like well if you do this, you know, somebody's gonna fire you then that's not the problem

857
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,840
I you know, I never had the problem now. I I was fortunate

858
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,120
because

859
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:38,760
Maybe because of my family but I could teach and

860
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,240
So I get real high course evaluations. So that sort of protected me

861
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,760
And because if you're not bringing in research dollars

862
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:51,720
It's gonna be pretty hard to survive

863
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,520
But I was able to do that. So there's some interesting stories on that

864
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,400
Well, I'll tell you one story

865
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:03,320
Some of Columbia Root study history study

866
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,320
And guide Daniel Hancock and I were

867
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,760
Or some contractors for

868
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:15,320
I said this is a dangerous project. I only want to be a sub-country

869
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:21,319
For the the interactions the biophysical interactions house all this stuff interact

870
01:35:23,239 --> 01:35:25,239
And so

871
01:35:25,479 --> 01:35:29,799
We're looking at the project and they made all these grants and they're out there and

872
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:34,759
None of it's gonna interact because they're people are just doing their own thing

873
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:39,399
So we come up with a scheme which we

874
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:45,000
We develop hypothesis systems. I said we'll have an annual meeting and

875
01:35:45,799 --> 01:35:49,559
Dan and I put up these hypothesis systems about a problem and

876
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:57,479
We'll present it to the the whole group and I said we'll follow the Bella cooking rule

877
01:35:57,559 --> 01:36:03,239
Anybody who doesn't like it gets to do that the next time anybody who can play so then so you end up with these

878
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:08,599
You know everybody interacts and we end up with these hypothesis systems

879
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,800
And then you reallocate the funding based upon whether you're going to actually

880
01:36:15,079 --> 01:36:18,360
Be able to address these hypotheses. So it's sort of a learning process

881
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:23,720
So there's a a an estoria there's going to be a workshop

882
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:27,079
there and

883
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,320
So the manager of the project

884
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:38,200
He says okay you will meet for the first half of the day and I'll do the second half of the day

885
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:45,400
Vice versa you'll do half a day. We'll do have so we said okay, so we prepared this for the citizens advisory group

886
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:52,440
And there are people in there who are fishermen and local people there. I mean they know a lot about the history

887
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,920
They know a lot more than I do

888
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:03,079
So we present this to them. Oh, when we get down there the manager says you do the whole day. I'm not gonna do anything

889
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:07,320
So I think he was thinking was gonna drop something on us

890
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:09,719
Actually, we say great

891
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:18,920
So we do the workshop and they loved it because these fishermen have I mean they they had ideas on this and we're sketching them out

892
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:25,319
And they said now we can be involved in in this and we can actually see you can come to these meetings and

893
01:37:26,599 --> 01:37:28,599
so the meeting ends and

894
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:35,960
We go out to eat managers there and I didn't realize we didn't pick up on his

895
01:37:36,039 --> 01:37:42,279
We're usually pretty good at picking up on body language, but Dan and I are still talking we don't realize how angry he is

896
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,039
Because this means our approach

897
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:50,439
He has to reorganize the boxes and he's got them all lined up

898
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,800
and

899
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,920
I didn't realize how angry he was until we're eating

900
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:04,680
And all of a sudden he loses it jumps up and throws his briefcase

901
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:11,800
So which I catch and throw it back at him and he storms out well

902
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Needless to say we didn't get funded

903
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,840
uh

904
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,840
But the whole project crashed

905
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,920
But the interesting part

906
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,560
Is apparently if I remember right my promotion

907
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:31,800
Committee was meeting like the week before so on the record I had this grant

908
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,960
So

909
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,680
So I was able to squeak by I guess I don't know but I made it so

910
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,960
But now you were getting by a lost track of the question

911
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,760
How do I feel at Oregon state?

912
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,480
The hardest thing to deal with are the stone faces

913
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,400
You bring up an interesting idea

914
01:38:54,199 --> 01:38:58,039
Something that you think is important and you get a plank

915
01:38:58,519 --> 01:39:00,519
And

916
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:08,119
I noticed this when David Lane would go with me since you got the stone face

917
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:13,880
And I think what happens is I'm not sure what's really going on here

918
01:39:14,519 --> 01:39:19,079
But people become so focused on their little field

919
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,359
That the grooves in their brain gets so deep that it just doesn't register

920
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,720
or they'll

921
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,000
They may say oh you'll just have to read our literature

922
01:39:32,119 --> 01:39:34,280
Which is just it's just not there

923
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,520
So it's it's been sort of a lack of

924
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:47,480
Exciting discourse I think that that's probably been the hardest thing to do with that's and that that takes a toll

925
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,640
And there is a story on this

926
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,320
David and the life

927
01:39:55,479 --> 01:39:57,479
Okay

928
01:39:57,479 --> 01:39:59,719
David big the lie at the huge guy

929
01:40:00,759 --> 01:40:05,000
No one wants to take him on so David shepherd boy comes up and says I'll take him on

930
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:09,639
So first thing he puts on the king's armor and he can't move

931
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:20,679
Okay, we put on a lot of armor. We can't move either like academic citations and references in the academic language and mathematical equations

932
01:40:20,759 --> 01:40:22,119
You can't move

933
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:26,439
So he takes off the armor goes there picks up and gets some stones

934
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,960
And of course the story goes

935
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:33,640
Slice go live. I said yeah, but what about the other stones

936
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:37,640
They don't tell you that see they lead parts for years post-apfelant

937
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:41,880
So I'll tell you what happened to the other stones

938
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:45,159
This is the first stone

939
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:48,039
He missed

940
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:50,039
That's what life is about

941
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:52,039
You miss

942
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:54,199
So then

943
01:40:54,199 --> 01:40:56,199
Second stone

944
01:40:57,239 --> 01:40:59,239
This is well

945
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,760
He hit him made a really mad

946
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Okay

947
01:41:07,079 --> 01:41:09,079
Okay

948
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:11,079
Third stone

949
01:41:11,079 --> 01:41:13,079
This is the one that's most painful

950
01:41:14,519 --> 01:41:17,000
What's worse than hitting him and getting really mad

951
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,960
I don't know

952
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:25,720
Get it make your shot hit him right between the eyes. He doesn't even notice

953
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:31,800
And he says that really wears on for a long time

954
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:39,880
So I'm at the end of my talk, you know someone said someone who knew the story better. There's another stone

955
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,640
What yeah, there's a fourth one. What did that one do? I said I don't know

956
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,600
I don't know

957
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:54,200
So my wife is there and I just leave I come home

958
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,000
She goes back and she says I know what the fourth stone was

959
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,079
It's the holy rolling stone like a what

960
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:10,039
She put on this music and it was from

961
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,640
I'm TV show John of Arcadia or something that word God appears to people is

962
01:42:16,279 --> 01:42:22,519
Is the janitor or somebody like this and it's like a holy rolling stone and I so I still don't get it

963
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:28,359
He says he dropped it and if he came the holy rolling stone for someone else to pick up

964
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:31,159
And that's a whoa that's cool

965
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:33,479
So

966
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:37,560
But anyhow the the painful part is often this is

967
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:45,239
Being seeing that there are some really big challenging problems and then

968
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:51,960
Just not being able to sustain this course. That's the hardest part

969
01:42:55,159 --> 01:42:59,800
We've seen a lot of change at OSU and this is the season of change for the university as well. I'm warning

970
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:04,920
Be interested in your perspective. I'm kind of where it's where the university's come from where it's heading

971
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,439
Yeah

972
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:15,079
Well, they've done a very good job in the campus and landscaping. I think the campus and landscaping

973
01:43:16,839 --> 01:43:18,839
Really remarkable

974
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:22,039
I think they've

975
01:43:24,039 --> 01:43:26,519
Pretty much given up on the idea of

976
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:33,159
educating and alert and knowledgeable citizenry you have to have discourse in order to do this

977
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:36,679
I think they're really

978
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,640
I'm very close ties with industry

979
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,840
I think Rod Adams who was the

980
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:49,960
Dean of engineering very close ties in the industry. He's now I guess the vice president or something now

981
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:58,600
And it's not that that's bad, but it's sort of like it is unbalanced and there there has to be some other

982
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:06,760
role where the university does some unique things that no one else can do

983
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:12,920
And I think they've forgotten that and I think they're good people

984
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:17,079
Embrace good person

985
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,840
Steve Clark's good person

986
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,840
But what I find in the systems is

987
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:33,640
The systems of depth so the people were very successful in them in a sense become part of the system far more than they realize

988
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,880
They become not just in the system, but of the system

989
01:44:39,159 --> 01:44:40,680
and

990
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:47,239
It's just too easy to start believing your own hype and that's sort of a danger

991
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,039
and

992
01:44:50,039 --> 01:44:52,520
You need scouts. You need somebody

993
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
I used to tell presents

994
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:02,120
Custard's biggest mistake. It's a little big horn as he didn't listen to his scouts

995
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,800
And the scouts somebody who's not bucking for higher position

996
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:10,440
And the only time you really need a scout is to tell you something you don't want to hear

997
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:15,640
That you're going in the wrong direction. You don't need someone applauding the direction you're going in

998
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:21,160
Okay, and so I think there's there's an absence of scouts

999
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:26,199
They're out there. They're willing to do that and I consider myself a scout and

1000
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,599
And I'm not a leader in the sense. I don't have lots of people following me and I'm not a follower

1001
01:45:33,559 --> 01:45:37,960
So I go out and explore and that's that's important

1002
01:45:39,319 --> 01:45:40,840
so

1003
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,840
We are testing with

1004
01:45:43,559 --> 01:45:47,239
I'm always trying something but with one idea and

1005
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:54,920
I'm working with Charlie Varys with former mayor and economist and court Smith and anthropologist

1006
01:45:56,519 --> 01:45:59,960
And it has to do with global warming and we have

1007
01:46:01,239 --> 01:46:03,239
Many many probably thousands

1008
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:09,000
Other here is students from places particularly China coming here

1009
01:46:10,359 --> 01:46:12,359
Very conscientious man going back

1010
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:15,399
That's a good

1011
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:19,639
So the question is where they really learning when they come here

1012
01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:23,399
I mean this place blows their mind

1013
01:46:24,279 --> 01:46:26,279
This is totally different

1014
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:30,279
And they're first of all they're wealthy little

1015
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Okay, so it's not you know

1016
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:35,639
It's not the peasants coming from China

1017
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:40,920
That I grew up with I mean bison pretty nice cars

1018
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:47,960
And they're living in a place that in any place of the else in the world would be called car heaven

1019
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:55,720
Corvallus I mean we talk about our parking promise. I mean compared to the rest of the world. This is nothing

1020
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,480
So they're learning something like being here

1021
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:02,600
And I think they're learning the wrong lessons

1022
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:09,640
Okay, they're learning. This is how things are done and if they're in civil engineering they're probably being taught how to do it

1023
01:47:11,079 --> 01:47:13,560
So we came up with a proposal and

1024
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,640
basically that

1025
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:22,920
Oregon State University and the city of Corvallus in the canary

1026
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:27,159
Would develop some of no car communities

1027
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,319
Serve by rail line we have an existing rail line

1028
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:40,440
That existing rail line goes north goes right through the middle of town goes through the southern end of the campus and right through a piece of property bigger than the campus

1029
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,279
The university owns most of it and then further

1030
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:48,600
Okay, you build a clustered no car

1031
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:55,560
Community I don't know the scale you want to get a scale that is viable neighborhood scale

1032
01:47:56,119 --> 01:48:00,840
So that if you were building a mega city that would be the sort of scale in the neighborhood

1033
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,480
Okay, so I don't know 1500

1034
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:06,359
3000 something

1035
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:08,359
and

1036
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:13,799
What you do is you involve the students in the design of this and

1037
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:20,759
In doing it we are telling them the way we have developed this has been a mistake

1038
01:48:21,799 --> 01:48:26,599
Okay, this cannot continue and we are going to do it for ourselves

1039
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:30,439
We're not lecturing you that you are to do something that we've done

1040
01:48:30,759 --> 01:48:32,759
You know that you shouldn't do what we've done

1041
01:48:33,639 --> 01:48:36,279
What we're doing is we're asking for your help

1042
01:48:36,759 --> 01:48:39,399
The help sign a viable community here

1043
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:46,119
In Carballes that would involve students involve faculty and some citizens from town

1044
01:48:46,279 --> 01:48:49,079
The rail line is all the way through there. It's already there

1045
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:53,479
How could we use it what could be the way to do it and what we would do is

1046
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:59,800
Involve the students in lessons learned they go look to all of the world what were the successes and failures?

1047
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,880
There's a couple of cities in China that

1048
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:08,199
Wants to get you that is pretty much a walkable city, but there's also some disasters in China

1049
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,560
So you learn from those okay lessons learned

1050
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:15,960
And then you get some of them to start building a virtual

1051
01:49:17,079 --> 01:49:19,079
Examples of this they can take towards

1052
01:49:21,079 --> 01:49:24,440
There there is a program where it's a construction program

1053
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:27,720
But I don't know whether you're familiar. I'm not in the video gaming

1054
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:32,760
But Atlantic had a magazine and of course it's an imaginary world

1055
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,520
You know

1056
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,840
Monsters and all the rest but they build stuff

1057
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:41,240
Well, why not make a real one they have a hundred million

1058
01:49:42,039 --> 01:49:48,280
Participants in this thing that's more they're all the university students in the United States

1059
01:49:49,159 --> 01:49:50,360
Okay

1060
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:54,520
So what you would do is you you make this part of their effort

1061
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:00,200
And what they would do is to say you want to understand the local culture

1062
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:04,360
It's this the university town we have a campus as some good examples

1063
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:08,360
How can you build on the architectural success on the campus

1064
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:14,040
So that when they went back they'd say what's the local culture?

1065
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,880
How do we build on the success of that local culture? How do we do this?

1066
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:23,400
No, we don't need to have automobiles and you can serve it in different ways and have viable communities

1067
01:50:23,799 --> 01:50:25,799
So anyhow, we've written up a proposal

1068
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:28,519
so

1069
01:50:28,519 --> 01:50:32,839
One page both sides and then we've written a memo which we gave to Steve Clark

1070
01:50:33,559 --> 01:50:38,439
Okay, and I got whether it went anywhere, but we're gonna start

1071
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:42,920
Spreading it out and we've been meeting on this for about a year now every week

1072
01:50:43,719 --> 01:50:46,439
Over the magic. So we're

1073
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:50,839
Where it's gonna go? I don't know, but you know, it's doable

1074
01:50:51,319 --> 01:50:55,400
It's doable when you look at when you look at the satellite photographs if take a Google

1075
01:50:57,079 --> 01:50:58,440
Gold or whatever it is earth

1076
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,800
You look around

1077
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:07,319
It goes right and buy right by a parking garage. I mean how ironic

1078
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:10,600
Right by a parking garage and then right on through

1079
01:51:11,319 --> 01:51:15,560
Piece of land you can have open space farm space all around it and

1080
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,119
Then there's there's another one just near fuel it back up

1081
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:25,079
And then you look at the sight of you the back of it is you know, it's about a half-bargaged spaces

1082
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,880
mostly empty now

1083
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,400
Anyhow that's that's that's some of the stuff we're working on

1084
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:36,920
Well my last question for you is as you think about the future. Are you able to stay optimistic?

1085
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,600
Okay, this is a good question

1086
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,159
There's a big difference between optimism and hope

1087
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,880
okay, and

1088
01:51:48,199 --> 01:51:50,199
There's a

1089
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,000
Cornell West the theologian from the Hill

1090
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
And he's black

1091
01:51:57,319 --> 01:52:01,720
And he says I cannot be optimistic, but I am eternally hopeful

1092
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:07,800
Hope requires courage to act when doubt is warranted

1093
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:14,840
Okay, now David Lane found that when he did a thesis and went I was in a class as honest class

1094
01:52:15,079 --> 01:52:17,319
David Lane presented that to that class

1095
01:52:18,279 --> 01:52:23,159
Their jaws dropped and they said why hasn't anybody told us that

1096
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,440
So optimism

1097
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,800
It's it's hard for me to just be optimistic

1098
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,480
But optimism

1099
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:39,560
Involves with the Buddhist call attachment you're attaching to the outcome

1100
01:52:40,359 --> 01:52:42,359
So you don't want to attach to the outcome

1101
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:46,839
And I realize an engineering you know, you're supposed to attach to the outcome

1102
01:52:46,839 --> 01:52:50,039
But an engineer can't deal with big problems and deal with a lot of little ones

1103
01:52:50,839 --> 01:52:55,639
The little ones don't add that all little ones may be good, but they don't that doesn't mean that the whole is good

1104
01:52:56,279 --> 01:53:00,439
Okay, the world with linear that would make sense for the world with linear

1105
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:04,039
I can be a great musician because I can play great notes on a grand piano

1106
01:53:04,039 --> 01:53:06,359
But when I add up all the notes it's terrible music

1107
01:53:07,399 --> 01:53:09,399
So the world is non-linear

1108
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,199
so

1109
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:15,799
I'm hopeful and I'm hopeful and

1110
01:53:17,319 --> 01:53:26,279
What you do is you don't attach to the outcomes and you you do something creative you try to make a contribution in there and

1111
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:29,319
You don't

1112
01:53:30,839 --> 01:53:35,079
You know of course sometimes you feel bad if it doesn't work, but

1113
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:38,920
I look back

1114
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:44,199
And if I look at all the failures if you wanted to say they didn't go anywhere

1115
01:53:45,159 --> 01:53:47,159
now someone did

1116
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,039
And if I had to do it over again, I do it the same way

1117
01:53:50,039 --> 01:53:55,000
So I have there's no regret so I guess if you approach you know, I'm 75 now you approach

1118
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:02,359
That age and you don't have regrets and you say no, I wouldn't trade what I've done with anybody else. I know

1119
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:05,480
That's pretty good

1120
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:10,839
But if if I ask me okay, well, why don't you list all your accomplishments

1121
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:16,359
No, I I know think that's the right question

1122
01:54:17,959 --> 01:54:21,079
Now again that gets to be some theological

1123
01:54:22,359 --> 01:54:24,359
that

1124
01:54:24,679 --> 01:54:27,719
In Cornell West hope is a courage to act when

1125
01:54:28,679 --> 01:54:30,839
doubt is warranted and then

1126
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:36,440
Hope also comes as a gift freely get gift that's what I call grace

1127
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:42,360
So he is I don't know I was gonna turn out, but I don't have to know

1128
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:48,920
Okay, and the idea of prediction and control is just illusion. It's just just

1129
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:59,000
Yeah, if you're building a cabin, maybe that's okay, but we're talking about the future of the earth and societies

1130
01:55:01,319 --> 01:55:05,880
Yeah, it's just just don't do that. So we need to tell that to the students

1131
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,560
Our generation use of talent

1132
01:55:11,079 --> 01:55:18,039
Well, thank you very much. This has been a lot of fun and I appreciate you being so generous with your time and welcome to your home

1133
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:25,000
Well, I I would again anybody who looks at this that the oral history is extremely important because there are a lot of things

1134
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:29,079
That didn't make it into all the documents that they're studying

1135
01:55:29,559 --> 01:55:32,039
And they may be the important things it's kind of what

1136
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,920
Sherlock Holmes dog that didn't bark

1137
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,960
Okay, the stuff that you don't find

1138
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:41,960
Why didn't you find it? Well, that can you learn a lot from that?

1139
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:48,279
Okay, we do know we can okay, well good. I appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you
