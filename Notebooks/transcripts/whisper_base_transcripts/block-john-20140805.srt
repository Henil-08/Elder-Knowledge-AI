1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Dr. Bock, if you could please introduce yourself with your name in today's state in our location.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My name is John Block. Today's date is August 5th, 2014, and we are in the family room of my house.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And we're going to talk a bit about your career and pharmacy and your association with OSU.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We want to start off at the beginning. You were born in Yakima, Washington.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That is correct. Is that where you were raised?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, all the way through high school and then Washington State University for bachelor's degrees and master's and university with cons and then Madison for my doctorate.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What were your parents backgrounds?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You mean business-wise, education-wise? What does it give us a sense of view?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, my mother was born and raised in Yakima. It's a funny story. Her parents were in probably the last group of pioneers.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They're actually listed in the Yakima Valley Historical Museum on some wall plaque.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They actually came out in a pioneer train. They were on a wagon train.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She was raised there and born on a farm. I think my granddad was a foreman or something like that. It was not his farm.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The interesting thing was her birth was never registered because she was a girl baby born out on a farm.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I was not pertinent later on after she was married to my dad who I mentioned just a moment. They got a court order.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Her is a court order birth certificate which then paid off when Medicare came along because she could prove her age.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My dad was raised in Buffalo, New York.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And in those days there was no State University in New York.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Per se, they were the State of New York supported different majors at private schools.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I think forestry was at Syracuse, engineering was at Cornell, things like that.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And he was a twin and second born. He had an older brother and his dad being German.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Said the oldest son was the one who's going to get to go to college.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So my dad took commercial courses. And in the senior year in high school his dad, my granddad, told him whether there was enough money for him to go to college.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, my dad sort of said he didn't take the college trip courses so he was not eligible for any New York school.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So he went to the University of Pennsylvania, graduated from the Wharton School of Business Administration.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
As my dad said before Harvard stole the faculty, hired onto the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And Harvey Firestone with Junior was in his training class.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then as he looked for a position to be a Firestone Tire salesman, he found that the Eastern Washington,

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
or actually the Central Washington District, had done very poorly.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And he had been advised, don't replace every tiring salesman who is real successful.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because you'll go down, go to one that is not successful, you can go up.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And he was successful. And he, Basie, I think was headquarter in Yakima, but his territory taken all through the Eastern Washington.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And they small wheat towns, clodous wash techno, I guess over the coal facts.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Maybe up to Spokane that I'm not sure.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
My mother, I guess they were going to a baseball game somewhere and got married.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Drove a Model A Ford for their Wharton trip back to Buffalo, which is where he was then going to work.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He resigned from Firestone.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And as they've gone, I guess into Canada crossing Detroit Windsor,

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
then into Canada, then across the Peace Bridge, into Buffalo.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And the immigration customs guy on the US side, of course, asked who they were, where they were born.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My dad said he was born in Buffalo fine.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
My mother was very naive and said she was born in Yakima.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And he asked her what part of Japan was that.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And she didn't have a birth certificate as I indicated.

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well then, so he got in, obviously.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Depression struck.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And what people didn't realize was that depression was roughest in the industrial parts of the United States,

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
because the manufacturing stopped, the people were all laid off.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And the rural areas, things weren't great, but people ate and they bartered.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So my dad decided we're going to head back out to the state of Washington.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And he had business contacts who could help him get established.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And so that's how he got back west, left Buffalo, and got going in Yakima.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Basically, Billupman, and a few oil gasoline distribution business, few oil before natural gas had come in.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you have any siblings?

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I had, my brother died a couple years ago.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He was eight years older than me.

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I say he died a couple years ago.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He graduated from Washington State also, ROTC, back in the days of the Korean War.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Of course, remember there was a draft on.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And stayed in the military.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Got to be a bird kernel.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so actually, I attended and participated in his internment in Arlington with the full case on, banned the whole ceremony.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What were you're just screwing up as a boy in Yakima?

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, that's interesting.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I guess I dabble around photography.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I had a dark room.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And would shoot pictures.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I had a 30-fold, old, Argus C-335 millimeter camera.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I graduated from a Brownie, Kodak Brownie.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And we developed my pictures.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I never did do color.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I did family photo-Christmas cards.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Took some of the pictures around the church I grew up in.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I got on the stage crew.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Those days was Yakima Senior High School, the only high school in town in those days.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And it was also the city auditorium.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It had a nice auditorium, full stage, dressing rooms and the basement.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And we would be, those are the stage crew.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If we worked for a somebody putting a show on, we would get paid.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I got my every spouse position.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I even got a key to the stage area.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And learn how to get along with the janitors.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I was on the stage crew when the Air Force band came through.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And there was a stage circus with a little baby elephant in the basement.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That upset the janitor because he made a mess.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And of course, there were the plays and things like that that were put on.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How much earlier, Snitch, an interest in science or in pharmacy?

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I guess it was just the science courses that we had to take curriculum in those days

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and it was pretty regimented in high school.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, even I come out of the era of junior high.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So grade school went through sixth grade.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Junior high was seventh through ninth and high school was tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And had very good science teachers.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They all had a master's degree.

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's pretty much in their subject matter, supposed to a master's of teaching.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And I guess that was how I got my interest.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't pick pharmacy right away.

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I went as an undeclared major at Washington State and hunted around and went to the counseling center.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And sort of looked at it and I thought, you kind of had the pre-pharmacy curriculum

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
as what I was doing.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And it was one where I didn't think I'd be stuck in a lab.

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I would know the public well, I ended up in a lab anyway, after grad school and academia.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What's all about your experience at Washington State and the undergrad and the budding pharmacist?

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, we lived in, there were two political parties in those days.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There were the Greeks and the independence.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And there was none of this that freshmen lived in the dorms their first year.

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you pledge, you went to your Greek house immediately.

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The person who was in charge of the dorms believed in a strong dorm system and loyalty and so forth.

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So if you went Greek by golly, you went to your fraternity or sorority for the women.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And of course, there was no such thing as coed dorms.

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The boys were on one side of the campus and the girls on the other side of the campus.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And if you didn't get the girl in on certain times, you got a campus and you had to give her a dozen roses, which happened to me once.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And the dorm I was in was nice.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They were sweets of rooms. They had washbasins in the rooms.

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There weren't the long hallways.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It was, I won't call it semi-private, but they were nice and they were quiet.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
They had real thick walls between the rooms, so plaster on a lathe.

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So it was good and we had a good reputation.

118
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We got one of the higher grade point averages.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There was this type of competition and an intermural, which I didn't participate in.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
My worst sport in school was PE.

121
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Just as an aside, you'll never guess who my high school, physical education instructors were.

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Bobo Braaton, before he went off to Washington State to be the famous baseball coach.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He was a high school PE teacher.

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What was the curriculum like for you in pharmacy as an undergrad?

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've seen it was somewhat different from what students did.

126
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, we had compounding.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It had a lot more lab involved.

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So I said we'd compounded ointments and creams and suspensions and elixirs and all that type of stuff.

129
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Otherwise, medicinal chemistry was medicinal chemistry based on what was known in those days.

130
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Pharmacology was pharmacology. Pharmaceuticality was pharmaceutical.

131
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It just, there wasn't as much known.

132
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The concept of a receptor was just that, a receptor.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It had never been one, it had never been isolated.

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Drug design was in its infancy, which is basically a group of compounds.

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And just the companies would screen them.

136
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And if they got a hit, they got a hit.

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The key fob of her amendments had not yet passed.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So you had to tell it a might situation occurred.

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm trying to remember when the efficacy requirements went in and they screened all the over the counter drugs and reformulate a lot of them.

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because the brands were popular, but they had to take ingredients out because they couldn't prove they were effective.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I would say the science and the efficacy requirements have greatly increased over the years.

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And now, there of course, into all the re-evaluate and the type of cystic that are used and how much are the companies.

143
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I don't mean this an anti-company thing at all because I'm sure some of the same stuff went on the lab and then University Labs too.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I was just looking at the number of papers that are being retracted nowadays coming out at University Labs and institutes and so forth.

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But when you throw out a bad study, when we were out at the bad study, it was probably a very important study.

146
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And I said something you better be alert to.

147
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So I would say there's a lot more in the stay-in age of electronic and communication and so forth.

148
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
May, may, may, may, the public may be better protected.

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
By the time that you'd finished at Washington State, it was pretty clear you were going to be a farmer since it seems.

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What about it? A field deal? What was your... sparked your interest, I suppose, in pursuing career in pharmacy?

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, I knew I could not do medicine because you know, as I'm holding my hands here and there's a slight tremor.

152
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I have what's called familial or idiotractic tremor and hair different grandmother through mother through me.

153
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And at least in medical school in those days there was a required surgical rotation.

154
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And you would not want me to be your surgeon.

155
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And in fact, in physiology we had to do surgeries on rabbits and we all had to take turns.

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And I didn't do too well in my rabbit.

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Unfortunately, I had three other people on the team that could bail me out, but I am...

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I was one of those kids in grade school when testing the measurement came along.

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
First grade, I couldn't get my bow tied on my shoe. I'm real clueless with my hands.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So you did want me in medicine at all or dentistry or anything like that.

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But I can count poor Lycan stick, I mean, which is of course, and convey knowledge to the customer or the client.

162
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But the follow-up later became Dean at Washington State, looked at my record and said basically,

163
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think you ought to consider graduate school.

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So that's just a faculty member took an interest.

165
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you put me off in that direction?

166
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You had an mentor of sorts.

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, definitely.

168
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, you went to Wisconsin briefly after you were in Washington State.

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, I was there for four years.

170
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But did you do some post-grad work at Wisconsin right after you finished your bachelor's degree?

171
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Am I right about that?

172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
After I went to bachelor's degree and I stayed at Washington State to get my masters.

173
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then went to Wisconsin.

174
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I was there for four years in a typical period time to get a doctorate,

175
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
at least in the chemical-like pharmacy sciences, came here.

176
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So I graduated in basically 1966.

177
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Tell me about your graduate training at Washington State in Wisconsin.

178
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Washington State was a traditional, I mean, for the masters was a traditional medicinal chemistry,

179
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
had a research problem, make a series of compounds.

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I wasn't there for them to be tested.

181
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But that was basically it.

182
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And of course, you take the appropriate chemistry courses with, in fact, most of the courses were in chemistry,

183
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
except for an advanced course in drug design.

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
At Wisconsin, did you want me to jump to Wisconsin?

185
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, I want to be ready.

186
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay.

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
At Wisconsin, again, they didn't have a course.

188
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It was interesting.

189
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was really going to work for a different chemist.

190
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And he moved on to Kansas.

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I say, I ended up at Wisconsin.

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And that's an interesting story.

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

194
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
God will be able to have a lot of inches on your, I guess it's no longer in here.

195
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I guess it's no longer inches on the table, it's a silicate chip.

196
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
One's in there.

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Right.

198
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I applied to three different graduate schools, or I wrote to three different graduate schools,

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and applied to two, if I remember right.

200
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I told you the person I was interested in at Wisconsin had moved to Kansas University of Kansas at Lawrence.

201
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But they sent me old outdated catalogs.

202
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So I just shrugged it off.

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I had, there were a couple of new faculty members at Washington State who were both Wisconsin grads.

204
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I was sort of getting input from them at the same time.

205
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And they knew the personalities of Wisconsin.

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I applied to the University of California at San Francisco, which is where the pharmacy,

207
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that's the medical center of the University of California.

208
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The original medical center for the University of California assistant there more than one now,

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and applied there and was accepted with a teaching assistantship.

210
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I got accepted at the University of Wisconsin with a research assistantship.

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And they, these two fellow faculty assistants,

212
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I just grabbed the research assistantship and you can start right out near research and speed things along.

213
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So I did.

214
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And it was very interesting.

215
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
In late spring, I got a letter from the University of California, San Francisco,

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
saying they would award me a Smith Klein and French fellowship.

217
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think probably I was a runner up and whoever they originally gave it to turned it down and went somewhere else.

218
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But by that time I had made my choice and it didn't seem right to back down.

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think when I'd accepted.

220
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And it would have actually been unethical for California to accept it me then.

221
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think they would have cared.

222
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But it turned out well. I got my doctorate. I met my wife this December,

223
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
would be our 50th wedding anniversary.

224
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So it worked out well at Wisconsin.

225
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Tell me about the environment there. How it was different from what Washington State?

226
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh.

227
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Wisconsin was definitely a research university. It was definitely publisher parish for the faculty.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The undergrad is as the former dean told me on my exit interview.

229
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He said, you want to understand the role of the undergraduate.

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They provide the tuition and support so that you faculty can do your research.

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So treat them nicely.

232
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, that was, I had no idea fans and butts about it.

233
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You've got to keep in mind Wisconsin had a longer tradition that a lot of the big 10 schools.

234
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because they had the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

235
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So when you drink your glass of milk with vitamin D in it,

236
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
the royalties from that patent that's gone to the University of Wisconsin.

237
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If you are using warfront as an antiquite on her rat poison,

238
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the warfist Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, that was all discovered at Wisconsin.

239
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And on it goes. So they were in the business full time.

240
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A known mistake about it.

241
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And a lot of us sort of had a reaction too, like do we want to be assistant professors in this type of environment?

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So when the opportunity came to come to Oregon State,

243
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it seemed nice attractive because there was more emphasis on the teaching.

244
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, before we get to see how I'm interested a little bit more in your research as a graduate student, how I progressed.

245
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Well, it went well. I got publications.

246
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It was a different type of problem. It was not a drug design problem.

247
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
My major professor was actually in the natural products.

248
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And he was very successful at it.

249
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But he had what was called a physical organic problem.

250
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He made his claim to fame by actually finding an error in a structure that the late RB Woodward developed.

251
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The only error was in the stereo chemistry. But anyway.

252
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So he wanted to follow up on that. And so basically that was my problem.

253
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I did not have to do natural products isolate and hope I got everything done with the 10 milligrams I could get out of the plant.

254
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I could just keep making my comp, my simple little compound and keep running tests on him so forth.

255
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So it was that type of problem.

256
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But otherwise it was a standard graduate university graduate chemistry lab.

257
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Lab benches. Everybody in there working postdocs and graduate students.

258
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We came to OSU in 1966 and told me a bit about the decision to move back to Oregon.

259
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It was mainly jobs were kind of tight academic jobs.

260
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I had a chance to interview at the chemical abstract service at the American chemical site as the parent of it in Columbus, Ohio.

261
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I could tell that was all going to get computerized at some point.

262
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I thought that would be a good mix. And I think I would have done well.

263
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But this other position came along and I talked to a major professor and decided to take it.

264
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So it turned out that there was an opening also at the University of Nebraska, which I guess I really wasn't that aware of.

265
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But a person I later knew and he and I became co-authors on the first textbook I was involved with.

266
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And he said, oh yeah, he knew about the, I'm not sure he got his PhD.

267
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But he knew about the Oregon position.

268
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And later heard it was got filled in and realized it was me until later we met with comparing notes.

269
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And I glad took Oregon because things have not gone well for pharmacy in Nebraska.

270
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They were in Lincoln, then they got moved to the medical center in Omaha.

271
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And the provost of Moodung was all very pro. Then Nebraska start half financial problems.

272
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There were two pharmacy schools in Omaha and the governor said, you know, I need one. Why don't we let Creighton be it?

273
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't know what he was still against having one of the state school, but anyway.

274
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So they had budgets cut. They did say the school, but when budgets cuts like that happen and good faculty aren't going to go there and some leave, that would not have been a good situation.

275
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This has been a growth situation in the pharmacy school here has grown professionally and enrollment too, but professionally.

276
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What were your initial impressions of the University of Corralis?

277
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Well, Corralis was a nice beautiful college town even, I shouldn't say even in those days.

278
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I like the fact I could even bicycle, I had a bicycle from Wisconsin.

279
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The interview was weird. I have to say because my colleagues at Madison were going for their various interviews and were talking about these research presentations they had to give and all this.

280
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I come out here and there was no affirmative action. None of that type of stuff. I was hiring the backseat of the Dean's car.

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In the townhouse, Lutel, after 24 hours of interview. So anyway, things were... I thought, well this is good, I like this. So I had a job.

282
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And my wife fortune is very flexible. And she had gone to school out of state and so forth as far as her bachelors and traveled quite a bit. So she was fine.

283
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And she's enjoyed this town too very, very much so. Climate wise, it's superior to the winners of Wisconsin. And then you have the hot muggy summers with the mosquitoes and Wisconsin.

284
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So, no, this is a very pleasant place to live.

285
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:17,000
How would you characterize the department of that pongier rail? Very heavy teach and orientate oriented and very, very structured.

286
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It was a small faculty. It was a... No, I believe it was a school of pharmacy. And then I think under President Vickor...

287
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It got to be Oregon State... It was already Oregon State University. It was not Oregon State College. A time I got here was Oregon State University.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And some of the academic units were colleges and some were still schools. And he finally said, look, I guess he told the Dean's, I guess. I wasn't.

289
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That if you want to be a college, you can be a college. So, I guess we changed our Notre-Head. We became a college. And that meant we had departments.

290
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But the worth that, I mean, medicinal chemistry at a department head and two faculty.

291
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Pharmacidics had a department head and three faculty. Pharmacology had a department head and two faculty. I mean, it was crazy.

292
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And I think there was a department of pharmacology, which is the old term for natural products. And I think they had two faculty.

293
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And so the Dean didn't have faculty meetings. This was Charlie Wilson. He had department head meetings. And so these four sort of senior guys sort of ran the school. And the rest of it sort of picked up by osmosis. What the heck was going on.

294
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And then we have faculty meeting once in a while. So, was there any sense of the history of the program that had been around since 1898? No. And in your research, you, whatever you can find. And I don't mean this negatively. But there was a former Dean.

295
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:26,000
His name was Clausum. And he committed suicide. And I actually had a graduate student who was an undergraduate here at the time that occurred.

296
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't, to this day, know exactly what the situation. I obviously, man, had depression of some type. And there was some story that he

297
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:58,000
had run up gambling debts and so forth. But I honestly don't know the truth. To his credit, he was a Minnesota grad, as I understand it. And he brought one of the first Rokai Rokai's, the National Pharmacy Honor Society.

298
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Tori, I think I remember what chapter we are. But we're one of the very early chapters. Is it a Phydelta? No, no. Phydelta Kai is a pharmacy fraternity. Co-Ed. There's no them on Pope Kappa's side that I was a member of. No, no. Rokai Rx. And there used to be a women's sorority. I think it's fallen by the wayside. Well, I know it has an Oregon state.

299
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And there were a faculty who were Phydelta Kai who wanted that. That's why basically Phydelta Kai used to be both Phydelta Kai and Kappa's side. Kappa's side fell by the wayside. And Phydelta Kai has been the predominant. And I am sure high active it is anymore.

300
00:28:44,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But Rokai still initiates top students each year. There is also a leadership group which is fairly new. And I don't know what is. And I think it's Rokai to join induction ceremony, spring it.

301
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Los Alsturder, CH2M Hill, Blum Nye Center, somewhere like that. So after Clawson died, they brought in Charlie Wilson, who had been at Minnesota and was down at Texas.

302
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And he was co-author of a very famous well-established, became very well-established medicinal chemistry textbook. It was Wilson and Gisffold. And Ole Gisffold was also at Minnesota. They started at Minnesota. And it was the first. So when I had as an undergraduate even. And they had got to be multi-authored. I ended up being co-editor for a couple of years of an author of a chapter or two or one or two editions.

303
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Anyway, he came and his idea was he was told he was supposed to try to start increasing the research capability. So he was hiring young faculty out of grad school. There was a new pharmaceutical.

304
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And I was a pharmaceutical. And I was a pharmaceutical. And I was a pharmaceutical. And I was able to get anything big. I would get smaller grants. And the pharmaceutical person went off to the industry. And it was Dick Mollhouser.

305
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There was an addition to the building made. That was just going on when I interviewed. They were in the finishing stage. I came in December for that. Well, it was a Christmas break.

306
00:30:37,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And in fact, you know how you usually pay to bring a person out for interview. No. I took my wife to Yakimov for the first time at Christmas time. After Christmas, we drove down to my dad or my mother's car and drove down to Corvallis. Went through the interview.

307
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And I think I might have got reimbursed for mileage later. He did pay for staying in a motel on the way back because there have been quite a bit of snow. So got me cheap. There was no this hiring start-up money. Start-up your lab. But to answer your question, when I came, the faculty had were scared around campus because of the addition.

308
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:51,000
When I arrived in September, they were all back in the new building. And the labs were set up. And I was pretty impactful in these days. Potentially yes. It did start some research going. And they started to see some increase in graduate students.

309
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The other speed department of pharmacy administration with maybe one other faculty member in the department that I'm not sure made over to.

310
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There's an interesting story that goes, Charlie Wilson worked very hard to get that addition put on. And the ledges, he got approval. And I guess those days it definitely had to go through the legislature.

311
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And the new offices are all to be labs with fume hoods and the faucets and the gas outlets and so on.

312
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:38,000
He went to NIH. Money was a lot more plentiful from the federal government those days. He went to, and I think it was NIH, make sense.

313
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And got a grant to outfit these offices as labs. And unbelievable. The state said, we budgeted X amount of money. Since you got this federal money, we're going to subtract the state money.

314
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And so they had he sat down the plans and put X's through marking out which lab offices could have labs in which ones would not have fume hoods.

315
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Did you get one ahead of life? I had one ahead of hood, yeah, because I was a new young assistant professor. But yeah, that's how strange things were in Oregon, for example.

316
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Which department were you in? Either we were called medicinal chemistry or pharmaceutical chemistry, I forgot which.

317
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
At the industrial level, the term pharmaceutical chemistry is what it's an academic level we might call pharmaceutical, it's formulation.

318
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And the drug design is in medicinal chemistry. But academia, seeing like pharmaceutical chemistry, was the drug design area.

319
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So what were your responsibilities in this initial position? Well, I was very surprised. I was going to be teaching a lab in medicinal chemistry. I didn't think there was such a thing left.

320
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So I taught a lab in medicinal chemistry, which took a lot of time. What do you mean by such a thing that was left as a sort of an older approach to?

321
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes, yes, oh yeah, they did various side building. I honestly gosh cannot remember where these experiments came from and so forth.

322
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But we slow it took years to get rid of that lab. I did not teach in the farm. We had a pharmaceutical analysis course and there was a lab in that.

323
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And those labs slowly disappeared as more didactic material got into the course.

324
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I ended up starting the second year. I taught the biochemistry course because that was my minor at Wisconsin. And the story on that is very, very interesting.

325
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I see a smile. So maybe you know part of the story.

326
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The dean and one of the other senior faculty had daughters, I think both daughters, who were in pharmacy and were really complaining about the quality of instruction from the Department of Biochemistry.

327
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It used to be biochemistry and now it's biochemistry and bio physics. And one of the complaints was that each quarter they would keep changing instructors.

328
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And this would happen each year. So over in the pharmacy school you couldn't get a reading on what was being covered when the students coming in who had had the biochemistry course because there was this rotation of instructors going on. It was a service course.

329
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And the pharmacy students would start to complain when they're kind of a cohesive bunch and that made the biochemistry faculty angry.

330
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And finally the dean says, I'm going to yank the course. Start teaching a John and try to make it unique.

331
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Well they had a rule in those days. There was to be no duplication of course work on campus. And they really got a tight about it.

332
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But I did and I started with the course towards a clinical approach and a nutrition approach. So I started to change a lot of stuff. I mean it was still basic biochemistry.

333
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
He still went through intermeneinary metabolism. We still went through protein chemistry. No labs though.

334
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then chemistry carbohydrates and then what was known about DNA and RNA and of course that is mushroom. But I picked up and in start to cover diabetes biochemistry diabetes the biochemistry of hyperliplidimias before there was much known about hyperliplidimias.

335
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And then I wrote a paper for the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education on a clinical approach to teaching biochemistry.

336
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Most successful paper ever wrote all my 100 reprints disappeared. They all got requested. I gave an oral presentation at the American Association College of Pharmacy. And it was packed.

337
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I was on a roll. It was not what you call research. Well the chair of biochemistry and other faculty member came over to have a meeting and said we teach that. Well they didn't teach that approach.

338
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And they find it up and we just want you know that we teach it too. But you can go ahead and teach your stuff. Okay. I got along actually with most of them over there. Fine. We got along.

339
00:37:48,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But every so often it would come up. One of the faculty members over at Dixon in the dressing room and it came up. You know his faculty members in pharmacy and this other this fellow biochemistry says so how come it is you keep teaching that biochemistry course.

340
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:26,000
There was a physical chemist in our living room. My wife was very active with American fields or was AFS and there was a group in our living room. And the physical organic chemist said, hold the sun, blurt it out. You know you really have no business teaching biochemistry.

341
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It wasn't even his department. That's really. Somewhere along the line I had a different reputation, different parts of the campus I guess. It's kind of fun.

342
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Particularly once you get 10 you're what they're going to do.

343
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But eventually when we went to the doctor pharmacy program.

344
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We met with Chris Matthews, the chair of biochemistry and basically they took the course back and it was a higher level course that we had the students in rather than the service course.

345
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I told them what I was going to continue teaching which was the nutritional aspects and some of the diseases. They said fine can I have our students come? I said sure. I don't think I ever did.

346
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So everything was fine. My understanding now what they have done is they're only requiring the first two years first two some quarters of biochemistry because we're still in the quarter system.

347
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And I'm not sure how they're handling the molecular biology. It has changed so much. And with the heavy research emphasis. The faculty are extremely focused doing their teaching.

348
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So you and you get such a turnover of faculty going on in the biochemistry and that's our courses too.

349
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There's very rare where you'll see one faculty member sees a course from again and there'll be a course coordinator who basically is job is to make sure the grades get submitted on time to the registrar.

350
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So there's a lot of this. You might say it's a medical school model that's going on.

351
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Did it seem that the pharmacy was resistant to change in terms of the curriculum early on or?

352
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:47,000
No. In fact, just the opposite. We see like we always had curricular upheavals. And that was going on nationally too. There are all these trends that you got changed to clinical pharmacy. You got to do this. You got to do that. You got to put in communication skills. You got to put in cultural sensitivities.

353
00:40:47,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh no, no, no. There's. It was always in state of flux. Always going through transitions. And what do you do about a student who was not right in sequence in the curriculum changed that what do you do for them? No. No.

354
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
No. That's just the opposite. We were very fluid.

355
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Tell me about setting up your research. It was you.

356
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Uh. That got off to a slow start. I basically had some undergraduates. And I really had trouble getting going. I did one based on my PhD and got the paper published.

357
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But I was always fascinated what's called quantized structure activity relationships. And it's a statistical method of drug design. And I end up with a graduate student named Doug Henry who was very good of statistics.

358
00:41:47,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And that's basically what Doug is where I got the bulk of my papers. I had a couple other graduate students who got papers. But overall, I basically got into the drug design area.

359
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I was publishing in that area and would go off to the Gordon Research conferences. Start to get a little bit of money from the.

360
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh shoot. Army. Army. And it was not the chemical warfare bunch. That type. And go back to their research conference citizen.

361
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Did certain things with them. I mean, published and nothing was classified.

362
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And I met it. I made a contact at a Gordon conference. So let's say it was that. So that's the base what I did. I don't have that many papers.

363
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And I Denver really got any real big grants. I think the biggest ever goes 10 or 12,000.

364
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Was the model pharmacy the model drug store still around. Oh, when I came. Well, there was a prescription lab. And they had cubicles. So the students learned to dispense. And there was phones. And there are some faculty member grad student would function as a doctorate point and prescriptions.

365
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So there was still that. Yes, but that's disappeared.

366
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What was your sense of the kind of climate on campus when you arrived in this is the 60s preceded and. Well, when I bicycle onto the campus that late September.

367
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:47,000
First day of classes. There was a group of freshmen in green beanies. And I was dumbfounded. I could not believe this because I've been to Washington state.

368
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It was not such thing as green. I mean, it was just a regular university. I could not believe it.

369
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It was a college. It was an ag school. When I saw the PhD curriculum. It was loaded with coursework. And the story goes. And I have one emphasize story could I never heard it face to face.

370
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But the dean of the graduate school in those days believed in lots of coursework because he knew that Oregon State PhD graduates were not going to go to the big research universities. They were going to go to the smaller schools and be teachers. So they need to take a lot of coursework so they could teach a number of subjects.

371
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Oh, that's interesting.

372
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:48,000
When obviously I knew I wanted to get tenured and in my third year I got a letter from the president university. Dr. Jensen saying you have tenure.

373
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I like this. I like this place.

374
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I wasn't promoted yet, but I had tenure after three years. And I had to go through any sort of.

375
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Then he retires and goes off with the Rockefeller Foundation somewhere. And they bring in President Nick Vicker, Robert and Vicker, who was a one man show. There's no question about it.

376
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:45,000
The one man show. Turned out he was a member of our church. And so at our annual church picnic he was there with his wife. And it was a OSU faculty member who was taking him around introduced. And so I got introduced to him.

377
00:45:45,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Well, it turned out that I had learned ahead of time that yes he was a graduate university Wisconsin, his PhDs in biochemistry. And a person who I actually taught my major professors course to the undergraduate of Wisconsin.

378
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And there was an individual who was on sabbatical from industry. A man named Dave Perlman, who was just a gentleman. And he gave the bottom lectures in this course.

379
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And somewhere along the line Dave Perlman told me, oh, Mac, was my picker, was called. And I were graduate students in the same lab in Madison. Say hello to him. And then Perlman later became dean at Wisconsin.

380
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So here I am at meeting President Vicker. And I said, yeah, I know Dave Perlman. Oh, and he's now keeping, he's both Dean and maintain his research program. And Mac's comment was, well, it's only Dean of the pharmacy school.

381
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I went back and told Dean Wilson, I said, you got a problem, you got a big problem. He didn't have a problem that turns out. I mean, he went on to his retirement and so forth.

382
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:19,000
No matter everything is said, I've never heard of Mac firing anybody without due cause. But what happened getting on back to my own personal. I went up for promotion. And it was turned down.

383
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:32,000
This is happening to all over campus because he wanted a standard dossier where you use outside referees. Well, it threw my department. He didn't know what to do.

384
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But to Wilson's credit, Dean Wilson's credit, who had been at Minnesota, and it Texas, he knew exactly where Mac was coming from and what had to be done. He says, okay, here is what we are going to do.

385
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:58,000
We got the outline. I need outside referees. And so I may have professors at school's function and form.

386
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And then I got, I did get promoted the next time around. And then made it to professor on the first time around on that.

387
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So, but that was happening all over campus. And not only were young faculty in Shell Shock, but you had department heads who had never been turned down all they do.

388
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It was right, letters saying they wanted so and so promoted and tenured. And it was done. You had Dean who had never been turned down. And it was, I didn't look back on your lap.

389
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But oh yeah, it was a traumatic time. There was no question about it. But the result was Oregon State University today.

390
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And what I never have understood is why there's no building or anything like that named after him. There are young faculty. I have no idea who he, who Mac was.

391
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And you give him a lot of credit for propelling university for it.

392
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So, I would say he, without him, we would still be second fiddle to the University of Oregon. And I mean real second fiddle. I think Portland State could be a headless.

393
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:35,000
No, he knew what had to be done. And he pushed. And I said, he is, is one person that he was his own provost. We had a dean of faculty in those days, Dave Nicodemus, who was kind of the good cop.

394
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And Mac was the bad cop as the president of the university. But I know, I know, and he had quite a temper. Boy, he could flare.

395
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But I, I don't know if anybody who was out, out fired, who locked horns with him. He just let fly. And I just, I don't know if anybody who was.

396
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And I'm not saying there wasn't. But he really followed protocol. When we did not grant tenure to a faculty member, boy, he wanted to make sure everything was dotted. And he reviewed it carefully.

397
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I think one that he didn't want to get lost, it's obviously. But I think he, I think basically, have you ever read about this fellow who is a president for a long time at Boston? I want to say Boston. He did a Boston College or Boston University, Silverman, John Silverman.

398
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And there's a review in the Wall Street Journal of a book he had written. Well, he's dead now so many a couple of years ago. But he brought to school, that school up into a major research university and hired top notch faculty. And he believed in academic freedom.

399
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But he also wanted to lead an excellence. And it caused the real transformation. And I kind of look at the two people. Mac never wrote a book as far as I know.

400
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
As the two of the same type, they had this goal. And they know it could be done. And if I get the right faculty, I know it can be done. And he basically did.

401
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
What does he remember about him as a person? It sounds like you knew him a little bit. I don't know, kind of a personal level.

402
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:38,000
He was very distant. And I say we're in the same church. And he just never seemed to let his guard down till after he retired. He just lived over here.

403
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:46,000
A couple blocks away. And one day after he retired.

404
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I don't know if he's here with a petition for a designer. Why be showed up to the house? Come on in.

405
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Sat down on the couch out there. And just talked. He even talked about being hired and things. He'd just...

406
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Everything was fine. He was retired now. There was no barrier between us.

407
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,000
There was a neighborhood dessert from our church. And we got the thing mixed up on the counter.

408
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So my wife knocked. I pushed a tour bell. And they said, well we're here for the dessert.

409
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, that was last night. It was last week. Oh gosh. He says, come on in. I think we have some pie. We have some cake.

410
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And his life is always very gracious. And we sat down and visited for a while.

411
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Well, what other colleagues of yours were important to you in OSU within Pharmacy or elsewhere?

412
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, there was the 9th department head Bob Dorby, who was very good.

413
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The one that we were basically parallel to each other was George Constantine.

414
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Who's here? I mean, he's over-albuming, but he's not the one you could always interview.

415
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Let's see. As far as contemporaries, I would say, those two for the most part.

416
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Doing some research on Pharmacy is more recent here. Is there a couple of names that have stood out as people who made an impact on...

417
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going to speak one more.

418
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
The dean, the gentleman who replaced Charlie Wilson with Dick O'Hall. Who was there for a long time?

419
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yes. And he once...he said, John, how would you like to be on the Board of Pharmacy?

420
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I thought, okay, that sounds like an intriguing deal because I wasn't setting the world on fire research-wise.

421
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And this is a State Board of Pharmacy. Yes, a State Board of Pharmacy.

422
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So I think I put my name in and the old guard in the profession that I'm not going to remember on the Board of Pharmacy.

423
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's ridiculous. And the vacancy came up again. He says, let's make another run at it.

424
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And I don't know what I have behind the scenes, but I got appointed at the Board of Pharmacy.

425
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Neil Goldsmith. Now, he didn't know me from out of it. It's all done by the appointments office.

426
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And of course, check politics. The Board of Pharmacy, I'm sure, was not on the Goldsmith's political radar screen.

427
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So I got on the Board. And there was an executive director on the Board, Ruth Vanderbier, at a real vision where pharmacy could go.

428
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
She had basically been the author of the Revive Pharmacy Practice Act, which gave Pharmacy a lot more responsibility in the State.

429
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And I started to go to the National Association of the Board of Pharmacy and regional meetings.

430
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I ended up offering a couple resolutions, got on to task force of the Board, ended up being on one of the permanent committees of the National Association Board of Pharmacy and on one of the exam committees for foreign pharmacy graduates.

431
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So that, that, I would say Dick had a real impact. I was on the Board for the mandatory eight years. When I say mandatory, you can't exceed eight years.

432
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And was President of the Board twice.

433
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I was going to ask you about a couple of fellows from the pharmacy department or the school of pharmacy. It sounded like it made an impact through their research. And one of them was James Ares.

434
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, yes, yes. He was on sabbatical somewhere.

435
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And I got a call from Professor Sandin, a microbiology. And I want to say it's Bill Sandin, but I may have the first name wrong, but anyway, Sandin.

436
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And he wanted some way to develop some method of buffering bacterial cultures in the cheese making process.

437
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And I said, well, the formulation person is Jim Ares. And so Jim comes back and they meet each other and they kept quite a collaboration going and had one of the most successful patents of that era.

438
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And Jim may still, and I don't know if the college is still getting some money. Of course, Jim getting some money.

439
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:47,000
This is the time release. Time release, yes. Right. Yeah, Jim had, he had, he developed industrial contacts. He probably had one of the biggest graduate programs.

440
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,000
He believed he's completely retired on the coast now. And he no longer have a home here. Carvales. How about William Gerwig?

441
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh, yes, yes. He and I actually co-taught in the biochemistry course. But Bill developed a fabulous natural products and was eventually hired away by the University of California at San Diego.

442
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But he had a large program, a very large program.

443
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:34,000
He took a sabbatical in 1972, Carl Jarrassi. Yes. Only about that. Well, I wouldn't take a sabbatical. People do. And so we arranged for the house to be rented by, I think, a couple that was on sabbatical from somewhere else.

444
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And went down, stayed at a rented house, went to the nearest team, over Polish couple who had not been back to Poland since the Second World War. And I think family there. Anyway.

445
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So I worked in Carl Jarrassi's lab. He's quite an individual. And of course, the father's birth control pill.

446
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And got four papers out. It was a natural products lab because without we're going to get really Sea Grant going. And we had various ideas. And somehow we never could tap into that well into the Sea Grant money here.

447
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But we thought we'd get a marine natural products thing going. It never did work out. But yeah, it was a good year.

448
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Did you get to know him very well? He's one of these people that has a fantastic memory. So he got to know you more than you got to know him.

449
00:58:43,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I mean, I was working on one of the papers. And I said, I bend, I think, and I bend, I bend the cam abstracts. I'm not finding this reference. He got up and went over to his card file, pulled out something from don't ask how that paper was says here.

450
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And he didn't do it in a way that felt like shrinking in the floor. And I don't know how I missed this. Well, I said, I did. You didn't have computer. I search in the cam abstracts in those days. It was all done manually with big thick volumes and fine print. But anyway, he came up here once he's he retired as a chemist and has written three or four novels and some plays.

451
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Sort of a Renaissance man, I'd have to say. And he came up. I can't remember who brought him up. But I went over during the break, reintroduced myself. He seemed to remember who I was.

452
00:59:47,000 --> 01:00:12,000
He's friends with Linus Pauling, who's also in the Stanford area at the time. Yeah. And I can't remember if I did go over here when Pauling's lectures are not falling came back to campus a few times too. It was you. Yes. Oh, yeah. And the only time I heard him on campus that I'm aware of. I can't remember if I went to any of the peace lectures later on.

453
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I mean, after many years, wife. But there was that one time when the African American football players walked off the campus because of the beard incident with our moustache and with Deandre of the football coach.

454
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And Pauling was to speak at Gil Colosseum and the students came in and Jensen was president. It was a it was an awkward situation.

455
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And I think Jensen felt very hurt by that because I think they see it was a very fair man. But you're dealing with a powerful football coach who had powerful alumni behind him.

456
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So it was an awkward situation. And I probably went ahead and gave a talk.

457
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You mentioned Dean of all he was Dean for 22 years. The longest serving Dean of his generation in pharmacy apparently.

458
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That sounds like there are at least a couple of changes that he invoked. And one of them you mentioned a little bit was emphasis on increased experience and patient care.

459
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Well, that was going on during the I would say that that was a trend in pharmacy education all across the United States. And you would very I mean, he was going to make sure we stayed current.

460
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
As part of that, the curriculum added clinical components, including can I ask you to turn that off and I'll tell you why.

461
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Act to.

462
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So we were talking about changes in the curriculum and focus on clinical components, including communication skills.

463
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, the history of communication has been a very interesting one for a long time. The pre pharmacy curriculum had some type of speech requirement.

464
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And the question was always what is the appropriate type of speech requirement? Is it it? So I think the word expository speech where you get up and give your three minute speech or your five minute speech, which is not what pharmacists do.

465
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:36,000
They talk one in one like you and I are talking to each other. And so what you want is there. They're apparently it was a speech course that supposedly was more how to interact one on one rather than with an audience.

466
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm not sure if there's still a speech requirement in the pre pharmacy curriculum or not. It wasn't there when I was an undergraduate. I can tell you that.

467
01:02:48,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I had it in high school. But that what happened was was mandatory counseling. In fact, I was on the board of pharmacy when the mandatory constant requirement went in.

468
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And it was happening across the United States. Part of it was patient better patient care. Part of it was get the pharmacists out there talking with the patient rather than hiding behind the counter and having some sales clerk and at all.

469
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So one of our I guess called faculty, Marisa, director of student health service pharmacy, Bill Boyce, and actually pioneered the technique for how to consult a patient.

470
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And there's a little card and there's three questions on it. I can't remember all of them how they went. But basically it was what did your physician tell you about this medicine.

471
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So your first of all rather than get through this lecture and I'm you're trying to find out what they what the patient's understanding. So you're not talking down to them.

472
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And that's also a good way of doing air checking the last minute because if you're handing them an antibiotic and the patient says it's for my high blood pressure, you know, just hang on a moment.

473
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,000
We got to check this out. But okay, we'll see what's the correct prescription.

474
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Another question might be what did the any could elaborate on the response or yes, I see you have a good understanding.

475
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:46,000
What did the physician explain to you on how to take it? And you find out or do they realize they are to take it four meals or two hours after a meal.

476
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And I can't remember if the third one, whether you have any other question you want to ask me or did the physician explain any of the pertinent side effects.

477
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And there you're trying to you're not trying to scare the patient or they'll never take it. But you might also or if you do get a certain type of sensation, you need to either call your physician or call us rather than simply go up and give them a spiel.

478
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So you're that you're trying to teach that type of communication on a one-on-one basis. Most of pharmacies are not even set up for it. So you're trying to have some place in a corner where nobody else can hear the conversation.

479
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But depending on noise of the story is Fred Meyer, they probably can't hear it because of all the noise. Rises I think you can hear the conversation.

480
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I have a silly question. I probably wouldn't even ask before how the pharmacists interpret the handwriting of doctors and the scripts that they receive. A lot of it is practice. A lot of it is now electronic transmission.

481
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And one of the most important things is phone and find out what it is that was written. So there isn't any secret code.

482
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
No, no, and they're not supposed to write in Latin anymore. In fact, they don't know Latin.

483
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's kind of moving through your career.

484
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I will. One of the one of the resolutions that we find I got through the National Association of Borders of Pharmacy was a test of spoken English.

485
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Not written English. They're supposed to do that also. Spoken English is very interesting to see the opposition.

486
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And of course there was all this about a political correctness, but you had to explain that the communication media is you could have a resident at a medical center who is from one country in Asia talking to a pharmacist who is from India.

487
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And the only thing they've got in common is the English language. Not saying the Asian one maybe that is good in English is the Indian one, but the point is airline pilots and the control towers use English.

488
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So now if a person a pharmacist is dual language so they can talk in another language and explain the directions or hand the person a information sheet in the patient's native language some of the computer programs will do that.

489
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Great. That's excellent.

490
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But still got to still got to be able to speak it.

491
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I want to ask you about you served on a National Science Foundation panel for instructional scientific equipment.

492
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I did. You're right. Forgotten about that. Yeah, it's down in I think Los Angeles. I think we all went down there. It was for undergraduate research and it was a very interesting panel.

493
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So in time I did and I'm not quite sure how my name got in there. Got never got funded by it. I'm not sure if I replied. But what was fascinating was you had good solid liberal art schools.

494
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The Lewis and Clark this date to Lewis and Clark's the reads the will amits. For example, applying for they wanted a new NMR a new updated.

495
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Inferred spectres, putometer for their lab. They would be used and they outline the courses that would be used in.

496
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And also how it would function for undergraduate research projects. And we.

497
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Oh, and they would also be able to show how they would be able to support the instrument that they had the technicians available to keep it going or experience faculty and you'd fund those.

498
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Then you would get a little small liberal arts college that maybe had one chemist.

499
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Two of they were lucky. Who wanted this to be piece of equipment. And you say, how are they going to maintain it? Do you understand how it works?

500
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Where is the course that's going to be used in? We wouldn't fund it. Or you got the application from the chemistry department at the University of California or the University of Wisconsin and Madison who just had to have a new hot shot NMR.

501
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And they were going to let the undergrad was walked by essentially. No, we didn't fund that either.

502
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So we basically funded.

503
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Liberal arts program. Well, it didn't have to be I'm sorry. I don't want to apply. It had to be a private liberal arts school.

504
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:01,000
A school like Western probably would not have any problem either. They had to have a substantial. We were doing it in the chemistry area now, please keep that in mind.

505
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Speaking of the discipline, they had to have a core of faculty. One thing that really helped them was where did they have a program that met the undergrad with standards of the American chemical society, which means they had to have enough that had basically faculty in each of the disciplines, organic, physical, analytical.

506
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It seemed a really important point in the modern history of the College of Pharmacy came in 1988 when the satellite campus was formed at OHSU.

507
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:48,000
That is still a dynamic situation. The Oregon State like some of the other pharmacy schools of history, historical, are not out on a campus where there's a medical center.

508
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And then the big debate is does the school move to where the medical center is or is the school stay where it is and try to do the satellite campus.

509
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And of course we did the latter. Part of it is how would you move our whole research emphasis and productivity. We are very productive.

510
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:24,000
If you take a look at the amount of grant money, this pharmacy school is now bringing in. How would it be situated? Where would be the support infrastructure?

511
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I mean there's quite a dynamic support all across campus. There's the mass spec centers, there's the NMR centers and so forth. So there's a real good synergism on a campus like this.

512
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And so how would that be handled in Portland area? Because there's not a major, excuse me, Portland State, but there's not a major research university there.

513
01:11:46,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Portland State has got some real strong areas, don't please don't misunderstand me. And OHSU is a medical center. They're not teaching the basic science courses that would feed into a medical center.

514
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And the students all come in for somewhere else. So that's one thing.

515
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So initially was to get the clinical program established up there for the fourth year and try to get rotations.

516
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And that took a lot of missionary work, you might say, to get the medical center to accept it. It seems to be working very well now.

517
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It really is. And of course there's both the medical center, OHSU, and there is the VA. And there's the other big hospitals, legacy, Providence, Kaiser.

518
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:10,000
There is. I'm trying to think of basic pharmaceutical sciences. And I have the impression that I want to emphasize this only in impression that there is some pharmaceuticals now up in Portland, as opposed to just the clinical.

519
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Well another important moment came 11 years later when OHSU decided no longer to offer the bachelor's degree in pharmacy and focus solely on the farm D.

520
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Oh, yes, that's got a very interesting history.

521
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:36,000
The question was, was money for one thing to find answer because you need an additional faculty, particularly in the clinical area.

522
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And you had to pay going wages because they could all work in the private sector.

523
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So the question came up, and I remember Dick talking about Dick O'Hall, talking about it, was, do we start a small farm D program and just kind of shoehorn it in?

524
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And there was some type of educational coordinating committee that was made to approve new programs, good limited duplication.

525
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I think it's passed by the wayside now. And the chair of that committee made the comment. He says, no, you wait until we can have a good program. We want excellent program.

526
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:27,000
The other thing they did at the state level was saying, you can't have a professional doctor program unless the students have a bachelor's degree.

527
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And there are these pharmacy schools, unfortunately, in my opinion, who a student can go through and get a doctor pharmacy degree and not have any bachelor's degree.

528
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Well, can you imagine a medical physician not having a bachelor's degree as far as I know, as Dennis do?

529
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I think all the lawyers now have bachelor's degree before they get their doctor, jurisprudence.

530
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And so we worked out essentially a seven year program, three year pre-farmacy.

531
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:09,000
We made arrangements with general science that they would accept courses in the first professional year, maybe some in the second, towards the general science degree.

532
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So if they don't have a bachelor's degree, they will by the end of their second professional year and they have to, before they take their last two years.

533
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Now it turns out I believe over 90% are coming in with bachelor's degrees now.

534
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But we were one of the first schools to require this bachelor's degree requirement.

535
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I think Ohio State was coming to the other OSU ironically, or coincidentally, or whatever.

536
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I believe the University of California San Francisco is always, oh, I should say we're one of the first.

537
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
They're always, they're one of the pioneers for the farm D program.

538
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And I think they always required a bachelor's degree.

539
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I think they always did.

540
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And that may have been true of USC also.

541
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:11,000
My understanding is a large number of the state pharmacy schools, the well-established state, you know, at the state universities,

542
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:19,000
are now, have got so much in their pre-farmacy that essentially there's a bachelor degree requirement.

543
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So they don't know about Pacific, for example, if a person who didn't walk in office three to four years or a year later,

544
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
actually they have a year around curriculum three and a half years, walk out with a farm D without a bachelor's degree.

545
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I don't know, frankly.

546
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Well, it sounds like this shift to the pharmacy led to the closer entire of the OSU became a degree between the two universities.

547
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Because it required a lot more clinical faculty, it required more clerkships.

548
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And more, making more rounds than that.

549
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yes, yes.

550
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
There's no, there's no question about it.

551
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Want to talk a little bit more about your career.

552
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You mentioned your time on the Oregon Board of Pharmacy.

553
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
One of, it's one of the interesting things that you were involved with there was assisting with the interpreting

554
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and implementation of the plan for assisted suicide law.

555
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Want to talk about that?

556
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yes.

557
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
That was a fascinating experience.

558
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Here was a situation.

559
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:33,000
You had the potentiality of a pharmacist who was opposed to it, receiving a prescription

560
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and not realizing why they were dispensing it.

561
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And in fact, they, under the patient constant, they make a lot and give a bunch of goofy advice.

562
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And may not even realize what was happening.

563
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And then you had the situation where they had a winemain.

564
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm not going to dispense this and pull the back.

565
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So, there were various scenarios.

566
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
The sponsors of the Physician-Sister Suicide made no if and some butts about it.

567
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
There was to be nothing hidden from the pharmacist nurses.

568
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Anybody, it was to be an open process.

569
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Anybody who did not want to participate, needing, and they actually had networks of physicians and pharmacists and nurses.

570
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So forth, who were positive.

571
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And they could always put a family in touch, get them into the system.

572
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So, we went back and forth with the Board of Medical Examineries.

573
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
No, no, scratch that.

574
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
We went back and forth with the Oregon Medical Association.

575
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It turned out that we've seen pretty well, have the support of the physicians, including the officers.

576
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,000
But there was a lobbyist who has taken his cue from the American Medical Association.

577
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And if a physician doesn't want to tell a pharmacist anything, that's it.

578
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
God is spoken.

579
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And so, we finally wrote a rule that said physicians had to tell the pharmacists.

580
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Well, all of a sudden you had the Board of Pharmacy write a rule covering the pharmacists.

581
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Board of Medical Examineries were not upset because they were being shoved, not pushed, not to.

582
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
So we now had our rule.

583
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And the Physician, the Oregon Medical Association, they're lobbyists.

584
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Didn't like it at all.

585
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So, of course, by this time I believe Dr. Kitsoper was governor.

586
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And so, in the meantime, we were trying to get through a collaborative drug treatment through,

587
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
which we had a trained general, says we had the authority to do,

588
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
but the drug industry didn't like it.

589
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And this is where pharmacists can be involved in working out the treatment, modalities, and the dosage and so forth.

590
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So, another Board member and I were called into the governor's health advisor office.

591
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And basically, what the governor did, he told the medical board,

592
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:21,000
you take that Board of Pharmacy rule and you rewrite it with your name on it instead of their name.

593
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And you push it through, which they did.

594
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
If that day was a draft and we approved it, that was fine.

595
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We didn't care. All we wanted was the pharmacists and all of these prescriptions were coming through.

596
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And so, we told the health advisor, that's fine with us.

597
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And then he says, so what now is it you're trying to do?

598
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And we mentioned collaborative drug therapy.

599
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And this fellow head was a former EMT or something on the ambulance.

600
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
That's how he knew Kitsoper.

601
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
They were fishing buddies from Southern Oregon.

602
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And he looked at, says, well, is that like when I'm on the ambulance, I can put Startheiv and for a person in cardiac arrest,

603
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
and said, yes, he says, oh, okay, you got it.

604
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I'll tell a lot of this from the OMA that it's going to go through.

605
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So, we got what we wanted and the physicians got, well, they know they got what they wanted,

606
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
but at least they have face saving on it.

607
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So, yeah, that's the story.

608
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
We're all happy campers now.

609
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You mentioned to the Eastern and Foreign Pharmacy Graduate Equivalency Examination Committee.

610
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, that's the exam committee with the National Association Board of Pharmacy.

611
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
What did that entail?

612
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Oh, you had a significant number of graduates of Foreign Pharmacy Schools that wanted to immigrate to the United States and practice pharmacy.

613
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And we had no, there's no equivalent of a basic pharmacical, a basic medical exam, basic medical science exam.

614
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:06,000
There's something that medical schools have after a couple of years, I guess everybody takes this test before they go out in the clinch.

615
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm not really, I'm really not quite sure how it works, but there's, there apparently is some type of standard test.

616
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
There's nothing like that with pharmacy.

617
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So, this is the closest thing to it.

618
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And there's other requirements for the graduate.

619
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,000
They've had to have so many years in a pharmacy school that has to meet certain curricular standards and so on.

620
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And there is a test of spoken English by the way, they have to pass.

621
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And of course, they test the English of the foreign languages, they have to pass that also.

622
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:50,000
So basically, there's a bank of questions that we work on, I have to be in the medicinal chemistry area.

623
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That's supposed to be equivalent to what, if they can pass it, then they have at least the minimum standards of graduating the dike-dactic coursework in a pharmacy school.

624
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Now, they still have to do their interning.

625
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And that, that sort of thing.

626
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So, I was in the medicinal chemistry. We meet twice a year.

627
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:22,000
We would come up with questions, just like SATs, any of these questions that are on there that are going to count,

628
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and there's questions that are being tested to see if they're discriminating or they're too difficult or they're too easy.

629
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And so, we would be working on new questions plus trying to fix the questions that didn't test right.

630
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And one of the things I did was, in the pioneer, as they developed this exam, the chemistry portion, some of the chemical structures were pretty bad.

631
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,000
They were bad. So I said, well, I've got a, I've got a chem draw program, which was sort of the standard.

632
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And so I worked out a deal with them. I didn't get paid, but I redrew hundreds and hundreds of structures using the same program.

633
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Something else that you worked on that is interesting to me, and my background with Linus Paul, he developed them all for General Amesthesia.

634
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And I understand that that's something you studied to the controversy over in General Amesthesia.

635
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Well, I, that's one of the contracts with the Army.

636
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And we were trying to see if there was a, a receptor for it.

637
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I think there is because they, they've got optically active, a stereotypical, sit left and right, and molecules.

638
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
One is active, the other is not. So there must be some type of receptor. But that never led to anything.

639
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Do I understand correctly? There is still no accepted theory of why General Amesthesia is.

640
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I think there is some theories for it, but I'm not, there's some about nerve conduction where it's going depolarization neurons.

641
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I think there is some of that now because they can visualize the brain so much differently nowadays with the various types of scans, the PET scanners and all that, but they can get some idea where, which neurons are firing, which are the brains are reacting in certain ways.

642
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
So I think, I think they're closer.

643
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You retired in 2003 after 37 years in the College of Pharmacy.

644
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And you saw a lot of change, and we could reflect on the changes in the college over that, of course, at that time.

645
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Well, I mean, we've been talking about them.

646
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
But BASY has started out to be a traditional five year bachelor degree program.

647
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:48,000
But there's no chemistry. Pharmaceutical analysis, formulation, for basic pharmaceuticals, what they called physical pharmacy, dosing standard classic pharmacology.

648
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And they were still teaching pharmacy management if you're going to have your own drugstore.

649
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
So I think there was some accounting in there.

650
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And as it became more and more obvious that pharmacists were going to be employees.

651
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You saw the management evolve into pharmacy, socially, economic.

652
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So you started, they started to be the discussion of healthcare delivery, which population groups can get it.

653
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And why, which ones cannot get it, and why not.

654
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Various types of insurance models out there.

655
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Then, as I said, the labs disappeared as far as the pharmaceutical sciences went.

656
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I think they still do a little bit of compounding, some basic compounding.

657
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But I think that's about it.

658
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And I'm not even sure it's a small lab.

659
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And they got some sterile hoods.

660
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And I think that's about all they're doing.

661
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I think I may be wrong on that, you'd have to ask somebody, like the associate dean or somebody to ask them.

662
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Big emphasis on patient care, big emphasis on the clinical pharmacy aspect, which is,

663
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
a person has a certain disease or a couple of diseases.

664
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And this drug causes this side effect and this drug.

665
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And our person shows up and they're taking six or eight, not exaggerating.

666
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Six or eight different drugs.

667
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And can that be whittled down to three or four?

668
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Because they take a drug to get a side effect, they get a drug to treat the side effect, and so on.

669
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
It gets messy.

670
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And of course, with the area diabetes, just use as an example.

671
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Not used to be basically insulin and a couple oral medications.

672
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Well, there are several oral and there's a whole bunch of other drugs that have been discovered that affect the pancreas, affect the alpha cells or the beta cells.

673
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And then there's even looking at the auto-eminology aspect of it all on the clinical side.

674
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I know that one of the pursuits that you've followed retirement is you're going to your Medicare resource.

675
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
And this date is called Shiba Senior Health Benefit Assistance Program,

676
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
which that notebook is sitting over there on your side here.

677
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Nationally, it's SHIP, Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program,

678
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
which the A haven't been dropped.

679
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Until very recently, we were part of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

680
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'd have to go to the computer and find out who the new federal agency is we're on.

681
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
We are moving under.

682
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I don't guess the move is not complete yet.

683
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And I'm not sure politically what the heck was going on and we got moved.

684
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:52,000
But we go, I started back in 2005 when the Part D drug propants began.

685
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:03,000
The person who was the coordinator was looking for volunteers desperately because they needed people to put the drugs into what was called Medicare.gov plan finder.

686
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And find out what Part D plan would work for them and I was retired from pharmacy.

687
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
So I've been better than ever since I was Shiba Lite for a couple years and then full.

688
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I think I'm the senior one in Ben County now, I believe.

689
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Anyway, we are, of course, go through training.

690
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
We have to be recertified every year.

691
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
We go through a background check, which includes fingerprinting.

692
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Obviously, we've signed all the confidentiality agreements.

693
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
We log every contact.

694
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
It goes into a, obviously, secure database.

695
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And our password changes every two months.

696
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I also am one of the instructors.

697
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We either call it new to Medicare or ABCD,

698
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
some Medicare Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D.

699
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That's a two hour free course.

700
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Most of them are taught over here at the Benton Center because they have the parking and they have the classroom with computer facilities.

701
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And I'm currently on phone duty now.

702
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Oh, I should explain.

703
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
If you have a Medicare question or you want to talk to a counselor,

704
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
there's two ways of doing it.

705
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
One is to call the toll free number and say them,

706
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:33,000
which you can get off of the web, put the port of Kachiba in and you can take it right there.

707
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And you punch in your zip code and automatically is referred then to Albany.

708
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
We, our sponsor here is RSVP Retire Senior Volunteer Program.

709
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And the sponsors for the different Shiba slash ships, very important.

710
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It's not known to County Department of Health, I guess, is their sponsor.

711
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And I can't tell you who the sponsors are in other counties.

712
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
It's Lynn and Benton and Lincoln are together.

713
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:06,000
But anyway, it'll go into the RSVP office at the Consulate Government's office on Queens Avenue over there in Albany.

714
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And then an email will go out to the appropriate county with referral.

715
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And I'm on phone duty.

716
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And the main reason for that is, I can't verify, may have mentioned when you came in.

717
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
My wife is on foster home and she's actually under hospice.

718
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
So I go up three times a day and feed her, excuse me.

719
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And I can't get up to the senior center.

720
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So I get the referrals and so forth.

721
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Which is kind of interesting. I kind of like that. I enjoy it.

722
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Almost better than, I don't mean anti-face to face, but you can,

723
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
you can get quite a bit of information over the phone.

724
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And we have Google Calendar to make appointments I can even make an appointment for them.

725
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It's just a seemingly complicated subject to be dealing with.

726
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:06,000
One of the things we mentioned in our classes, and we'll tell clients when they almost are feeling sheepish,

727
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:15,000
when we worked and you had employer health insurance, you took the employer plan.

728
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
That was it. I mean, you might have had a choice to in a high deductible or low deductible,

729
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
but basically that was it folks.

730
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And they may or may not have had dependency coverage.

731
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Okay, now you're reaching 65.

732
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
What are you going to do? Are you going to keep working?

733
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Or as your company or your employer says, fine.

734
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
If then are you going to draw Social Security or not?

735
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
And a lot of people think, well, if I don't draw Social Security, I don't go into Medicare.

736
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And no, wrong. At age 65, you have got to enroll in Medicare or you're going to get penalized.

737
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And the penalties can be significant, by the way.

738
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Unless you happen to be an employer group health plan of 20 or more employees, at which case you can delay it.

739
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So Medicare has been described as yes, no, and with the following exceptions.

740
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:35,000
But it is universal health care single payer for the over 65 and over and for disabled.

741
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It interfaces with private insurance to pick up deductibles and co insurance.

742
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And this is where a lot of people then should I go with a Medicare supplement, known as a Medigap,

743
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,000
or should I go with an Advantage plan? And if I decide to go with an Advantage plan, which one should I go with?

744
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Advantage to go with a Medigap, which one should I go with?

745
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:07,000
So there are these various. And then there's the fall open enrollment period where people can change plans.

746
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And now with the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare crowd also start making appointments because they see all this publicity on the Affordable Care Act.

747
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:21,000
They want to know how this affects them. It doesn't. Well, it does, but there's nothing they can do about it.

748
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Well, the effect is basically beneficial. The donut hole will slowly disappear in the Part D.

749
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So there's a clue I need for people like you to help people navigate.

750
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, it keeps us mentally alert, poorly straight.

751
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Well, I'll just take a couple more questions for you. The new building in Portland just opened up.

752
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I haven't seen it, but they say it's very nice. The other tower, the end of its beautiful view of the river, they could even watch barges being watched.

753
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But I have not seen the new one, other than dry buy it. It's going up.

754
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It just strikes me as being another important chapter, I guess, in the history of pharmacy.

755
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I think they worked very, they being the current dean and the previous dean.

756
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:26,000
It worked very hard to make sure we had the floor space and the labs and so forth to be a fully not move us there, but to make sure that the faculty there had the resources and are to advance.

757
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
A number of them are hired as clinical assistant, clinical associate professors.

758
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:37,000
That's a non-taniour track type of deal with a revolving fixed term type of thing.

759
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
But they're a tenure track faculty up there too.

760
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:48,000
The last thing I want to ask you about is that the university has changed so much in the last few years and continues to change and grow.

761
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
That's a good perspective on where I always use heading right now.

762
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Well, I have the impression that we want to be the strongest university in the state, which I have no problem with.

763
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
We're in Carson, every county.

764
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I think our relationship with the state is quite good.

765
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:19,000
The amount of extramural funding that we bring in is phenomenal.

766
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It's not just NIH. I mean, there's ag, there's Sea Grant, all that type of thing.

767
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I think the question that OSU has to really wrestle with as do any research university is making sure that the undergraduate student is able to do research.

768
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:45,000
It's sure that the undergraduate still has a good education experience, which at a good research university they can.

769
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,000
You have good students and you can get them involved in the searching out at new knowledge.

770
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
It can be a fabulous, fabulous experience.

771
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:06,000
But the faculty have to want to enjoy working with undergraduates, not just their graduate students and their postdocs.

772
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:13,000
And for that young assistant professor, that can be a time-telling. That can be a strain.

773
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Because it's hard to get the funding. I mean, back in the days when the funding was more plentiful, it probably wasn't.

774
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
But they are struggling to bring that money in.

775
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And they're hired now with fairly generous startup packages.

776
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And they return the university wants them to produce. You might almost pay it back.

777
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:49,000
So it's a rough go. And I have to be very candid and say, would I today start out the same way?

778
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I think pharmacy was fine. And with the clinical pharmacy and so forth, I might find that more...

779
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I'm more interesting. Many more instincts are wrong word. But I don't know if I would like to be under that constant gun of getting funded and get it renewed.

780
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:24,000
So I think that's my temperament. I felt very fortunate that Dickel Ball kind of took me under his wing there and said, why didn't you?

781
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I think he saw it, was going to pull in big bucks. Why don't you look at the regulatory. And I think I was successful there.

782
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Well Dr. Bach, thank you very much. This has been very educational for me. I appreciate you giving us this time to share your memories of pharmacy.

783
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Well, thank you for coming. And whatever I said, I'll be dying.
