1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
All right Ralph if you would please introduce yourself with your name in today's

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,540
date in our location. Okay. Ralph Coleman also Ralph Coleman, Jr. dates July 8th and

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,559
we're in my long-time residence in Eastmoreland neighborhood in Portland and

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,120
we're going to discuss OAC and the three states. Yes talk about your father and

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,719
your association with the University of Maccora-Valice as well. So let's start

6
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,920
with your dad and you give us a little background on his upbringing where he was born

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,879
and where he was raised. Okay sure he was born and raised in Canby which is a

8
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:47,759
suburb of Portland, South and basically a farming community. He had a small

9
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,480
family. He had a younger brother, two-year younger brother. His father, P.L. or

10
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,559
Philip Coleman had come west from Ohio and probably before the turn of the

11
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,280
century and had was an educator and was the superintendent of the schools there

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,159
in Canby. That's where my dad grew up when the Canby High School graduated and I

13
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,719
think they're very first graduating class 1914. Victoria State then OAC.

14
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,679
And it's not entirely clear what year he was born. Well it's pretty clear it's 1896.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,960
There's an affidavit from his aunt who raised him and stating the birth date and so on.

16
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,599
Back in 1896 there was no birth certificates so the records were either kept in a family

17
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:53,319
Bible or written down someplace. But he turned up in 1900 census somehow as having been born in 1895

18
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,959
so he could use that. He wanted to be a year older. He used to 1895, he wanted to be a year younger

19
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:09,000
he'd used 1896. And his mother died when he was about four or five years old and

20
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,240
and there were the family that my grandfather had married him to sort of took the boys on and raised them.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,400
And his primary character was his aunt Ella in Canby.

22
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,199
It sounds like athletics were important to him from early age.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,240
Well I would seem so you know that in that era they probably I don't know if they played football

24
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,439
or anything like that but yes they had baseball team. There's a picture in these archives of him

25
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:51,800
in his uniform and with his team and played baseball for the local team. Herds arm or shoulder

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:00,439
or something and was not expected to ever play baseball again. So he made the decision to go to

27
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,000
Oregon Agricultural College in 1914. Do you know why he made that decision? I don't.

28
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean they were talked about it is probably closer than the U.L.

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,319
that the decision to go to college period. The decision to go I don't know that's interesting

30
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:25,319
his brother never went and his dad had been to college but it wasn't a tradition you know the

31
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,199
family none of the his extended family in the Canby area I don't think it ever meant to college.

32
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,560
So I don't know what motivated him to do this just a smart you know ambitious kid.

33
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,359
People liked him he took off. He made it in dairy husbandry.

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,280
Major in dairy husbandry he got well he'd grown up in the farm community and on the farm so

35
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:54,280
this was a natural thing for him and there's pictures of him on campus with his hat and tie

36
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,960
and coat judging a cow or something like that. So he came out with a degree in dairy husbandry in 1918

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:13,240
and was immediately drafted into the army in World War I and went to Fort Lewis now Camp Lewis

38
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:22,199
the time for Lewis infantry basic you know the meat grinder route the war was climaxing in 1918

39
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:28,199
and the big offensive were going on so I needed a lot of people and he was

40
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:35,480
infantry basic applied for OCS officers candidate school excepted him to that

41
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:44,759
and that prolonged stay just long enough for the war in before they left but he was commissioned

42
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:51,800
a second lieutenant and the machine gun battalion or something like that and Maddie's due avoid

43
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,519
the war. Did he ever talk about his academic experience as a student?

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Well I don't remember any great you know long comments about that it was primarily an agricultural

45
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:19,000
school had a technical component to it that agriculture was the main thrust and I don't know it's

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,879
that's that's a good question I don't know what it didn't hear that much about the coursework

47
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,319
well we normally associate him with baseball but it sounds like he's perhaps his greater talent

48
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,399
was in track and field that's true it was he was he even talked about this he went or he's

49
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,759
he'd never run at all when he never competed there had been an erase never did anything and

50
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,759
somehow got acquainted with some people on the track team in the cross country team and

51
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:55,079
he said come on run run with us and he ran him into the ground basically it's a natural

52
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:03,799
and so they said okay you're a come out track you know and had developed into quite a

53
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:12,840
respectable distance man his best time in the mile was in it was about 420 and I think my son is

54
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,759
looking up the world's record of the time was about 415 or 14 or something like that so this

55
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:30,280
was a very respectable level of achievement and there would have been an Olympics in 1918

56
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,399
that he probably would have you know tried for the American team and probably better pretty good shot

57
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,639
at it of course the water caused that to be canceled so that was the end of that but no track was his

58
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,519
major athletic activity at Oregon State he was captain of the track team competed in the Long Zop

59
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,639
and all that sort of thing so yeah that was his first that was his first athletic activity did he

60
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,919
ever express any regret that he couldn't have tried to be on the 11th team well maybe in passing but

61
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:07,560
you know that's the way it goes we all have good issue the wood of us you know yeah we only

62
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,599
played baseball for one year at Oregon made OEC yes I think that's correct he he was playing he told

63
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:23,399
me he was playing Inter-Murrow baseball you know not diversity and the and the that didn't

64
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:30,120
feel good you know injured shoulder apparently have healed up in intervening years and coach saw him

65
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,519
play or heard about him said you know going out and picked so he pitched some games for them in his

66
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:40,679
senior year and was pretty effective I don't think they played more than 20 games you know a season

67
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:48,839
and then later on he he was good enough to play professionally for three or four summers after

68
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,599
he got out of college for the Portland viewers which at the time was a AAA club and it good success good

69
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:03,399
enough to be looked at by majors and at that time a team like Portland would own the players outright

70
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,799
and the major leagues would buy the players from the teams they wanted if they wanted to buy

71
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:13,719
them from the team that's how the team made money he was selling their players and the majors so he

72
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,480
had was looked at by Detroit I think and they wouldn't have been in Oregon State he was on the staff

73
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:29,160
by that time I think he turned away from that the more secure position at OECU and professional

74
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,240
baseball at that the more secure position the more secure position yeah baseball in those days you

75
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,680
paid nothing careers were short you know there are no pensions nothing you just played for a while

76
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,919
and then you were gone and that was it so he you know figured he was pretty well positioned where he was

77
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:53,879
stayed on he got married getting by that time too well tell me about the OECU

78
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,719
little club oh I don't know very much about it just heard the name but I think that was a

79
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:06,919
the closest I can think it might have been kind of a a eating club you know they live there

80
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:14,360
and what they call co-ops might have been a co-op and sort of a semi fraternity and that morphed

81
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,839
into the Gamma Talk Beta while I think he was still an undergraduate when that came about

82
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:31,480
and then the Gamma Talk Beta eventually of course became double UPSLON in 1922 and that was a big

83
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,200
part of his you know association with the regular state well through through his living

84
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,560
situation he encountered a couple well a few pretty extraordinary people that he mentioned his best

85
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:54,600
friends were spec keen and double SMAK well they were close and spec was from Salem and was a good

86
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,759
athlete student body president and they became good friends he was the best man at my days waiting

87
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,320
and they were their family and our family were lifelong friends they saw a lot of each other and

88
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,440
spec was always around and he became athletic directors you know at the at a regular state

89
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,200
where he closed ties in fact his daughter lives in Kraval she'd be a good person to contact

90
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,120
sometime she'd be willing to you know provide information for him Doug McKay I think he might have

91
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,480
been a little more than an idea maybe a year so of course he would on become governor and secretary

92
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:42,120
of the interior and under eyes now so any other recollections of spec keen and double K or stories

93
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,600
about your father's association with them well spec was just a marvelous person and

94
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:57,399
load fishing and hunting and just all around good administrator a good guy and they did a lot

95
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:05,800
of fishing and and hunting together every summer for a number of years we all go to Nesquan

96
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,840
are you familiar with Nesquan it doesn't look any different you know today than I did then

97
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:17,000
or a couple of weeks and the you know eight or ten families from the Oregon State and from

98
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,879
Salem and various places and that was just our summer outing that was Nesquan some of the houses

99
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:30,679
we stayed in and in the mid 30s are still there looking just exactly like they did back then so

100
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,559
there's a lot of interaction you know a lot of closeness and in in the time maybe people still do that

101
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:47,719
I don't know how did how did Ralph meet his wife I don't know to say the truth she was a student

102
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:55,399
at Oregon State a tri-delt she grown up in Colberg and went to the University of Oregon for a while

103
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,359
and then transferred to Oregon State I'm not sure why she was about three years younger

104
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,279
like that and it was a very come-we young woman all the stories and pictures of her after a while

105
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:22,200
as well and so I don't know the details they dated and got married in there in her parents' house

106
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,759
in Eugene I think it was and later on they lived very firstly lived with us in Corvallis

107
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:34,759
for the better part of their lives and a very nice extended family situation

108
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,240
did he talk anymore about other social activities or more about fraternity life for his school years

109
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:49,559
well he tell the usual pacing stories and things like that it didn't sound all that much

110
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:57,879
different from my own experience you know 40 years later but it was I think Oregon State was a fun

111
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,080
place I don't think they took life all that seriously but we see in those years it was an

112
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,559
ag school primarily with a big military complement engineering was certainly on the picture but I

113
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:18,840
think it was mostly a local people you know local kids went there did he mention his ROTC experience

114
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,000
yeah he thought that was great he loved ROTC he was good at it he had a lot of kind of a command

115
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,559
presence and just resonated with his mentality I guess and the ROTC I think was what got him

116
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:44,360
in the OCS you know may have saved his funds if they're at Fort Lewis Camp Lewis

117
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,440
well I mentioned that the World War I experience kind of came in when in 1919 he returned to Corvallis

118
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,880
all right got out of the military in that fall as he warned in November I think he got out probably in

119
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:09,480
80 later on in the year anyway he went to boot back to Corvallis and was hired by the Corvallis

120
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:18,120
schools in their intramural or their PE athletic aspect of coaching and things like that

121
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,879
and you know it was no background whatever and education and I think he did that for a year

122
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,799
then was hired put on the staff at Oregon State in the physical education department

123
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:41,720
and they kind of tasked with developing digital programs and expanding that into the those

124
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,399
facilities and activities available to the whole student body he did that pretty much

125
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,879
resting his career he was head of intermenziner murals head of men's physical education so he

126
00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:00,039
was in the PE department in 1919 and was there until 1966 so he found a home yeah

127
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,240
intermurals are pretty extensive these days at OCS you and what's that like

128
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,199
what's that like in tumurals are very extensive though I see these days and apparently we had a

129
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,039
ROTC on thanks for well he got them started he didn't finish it but that was what he that was his original

130
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:23,799
in fact there's a little side for you you know where the tennis courts are and it would be west of

131
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,000
it would be just north of the football facilities all that was the original cold and field

132
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,719
really yeah it was the intermural field

133
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,480
and that's very you know I don't know it was ever formally you know just go to call that

134
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,200
and then when he you know when the coaching and then he was there forever then that became

135
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,279
cold field no interesting little side there that's that's kind of fun

136
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:01,320
he lived at the Gamma Talbada House during this time yes and I know little about that

137
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:09,800
but like I say during the while he was when he came back after after the war and he

138
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:17,640
risked kind of reassociated with the with the fraternity in fact lived there and he didn't

139
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,480
wasn't in college or anything but he just moved in and that's when they assigned him this

140
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:35,560
promising but kind of socially awkward depression minus falling and my dad wasn't at school but he

141
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,320
was you know supposed to look out for a minus and socializing and you know getting going in school

142
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,039
and that's when he reported that to the house that he didn't think this guy isn't going to make it

143
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:53,080
never to stay never studies all he does is read polp westerns and sleeps a lot but so he

144
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,759
totally missed the mark on that one minus was so easy for Pauling that he didn't have to exert

145
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,759
yourself at all and as you know he was coaching or teaching undergraduate chemistry I think by the

146
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:14,839
time he was a sophomore junior so he and was a good guy I guess you know a popular guy and one of the

147
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:21,400
guys and you know think of two-time Nobel Prize winners is one of the guys normally I think he

148
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:30,200
always I think he always cherish that relationship you know because he was shy and sort of you know

149
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,880
I miss fit when you're that smart and that you know that level of achievement I think it's you do

150
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:46,200
I think find yourself kind of on the outside so to whatever extent it's true I think the Gamaton

151
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:54,120
beta is socialized him and would you like me to expand on that a little bit yeah absolutely okay

152
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:01,160
I I met Linus a few times we weren't close friends or anything like that but he he never forgot

153
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:10,680
a ring of state and in the Gamaton of beta it became Delt Eupselon in my team 22 national

154
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:17,720
fraternity and Linus Pauling and my dad and the number of other people were chartered members

155
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,480
and there's pictures somewhere in the cell of this group you know and his in 1966 it would have been

156
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:42,279
the 40-year 60s yeah I was later in that well it's in my documentation or somewhere they had a

157
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:50,519
a reunion during a anniversary might have been the 50th meeting the 60th anniversary of the

158
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:57,400
founding of the fraternity and you know all the alums in the Portland area and so on were there

159
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,880
and they rounded up as many of the charter members as they could find and there were about

160
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,720
eight or ten of them something like that and Linus's one and my dad was one and each one of them

161
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,280
took their turn at the myocentral stories you know about their experiences at the bed or your state

162
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Linus was particularly funny because when they were applying to the national fraternity they

163
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:33,480
had to list the achievements and attributes and all the potential members and they wanted to have

164
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:40,200
you know some athletic experiences for everybody you know he played this he did that Linus had no

165
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,960
athletic you know background whatever so my dad was assigned the chore of teaching him to run

166
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,079
hurdles so they could claim he was a track man and Linus described you know and there's a very

167
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:02,120
funny way is he and my dad bounding around the track you know or Travallis jumping over

168
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,600
over hurdles so he could claim to be a hergler so he had a Linus that a good sense of humor and he

169
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,680
told some interesting stories he told about he talked for about 45 minutes just unscripted and I

170
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:23,080
just I'd give anything to him had a a recording of that because he talked about his his experiences

171
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:36,039
with passports and beaches and he was on his way to Stockholm to get one of his Nobel prizes

172
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:46,599
and they landed in Oslo and nobody met him nobody from the embassy came to greet the plane or anything

173
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:57,559
he was he was you know not a good repute at the time and so he went on to Stockholm on his own and then he

174
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:07,079
he was also given the prize he got from the award he got from Russia the Lennon Peace Prize

175
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:15,799
Lennon Peace Prize okay and so he had been awarded the Lennon Peace Prize and was you know

176
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:23,000
requested to go to Russia and receiving he couldn't get a visa and just couldn't get permission

177
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,160
from Russia to enter Russia here he is gonna get the Lennon Peace Prize they wouldn't have

178
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,680
any money in the country so he contacted one of his science colleagues in Russia and say you know

179
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,559
what the hell's going on here I'll come I can't come they won't let me come so the guys did not

180
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,559
look and do they got back to me said well they got two the Linus Pauling files yeah one is Linus Paul

181
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,839
and you know peace loving advocate the world peace and so on the other is Linus Pauling

182
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:56,759
capitalist running dog this one somehow the application got in the comments of

183
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,240
capitalist running dog file so they wouldn't grant it they got a straight down but I thought

184
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,399
that was you know it's kind of a typical cold war snafu you know they weren't they weren't on

185
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:11,720
the same page anymore the rest of us were so anyway he got there and got the Lennon

186
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,600
prize and of course this was a controversial event you know was when was that the 60s yeah 60s

187
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,039
out 70s maybe yeah cold war and that didn't go down well and because he was being criticized for

188
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:32,279
you know his nuclear test band proposals and atmospheric testing so on so he was he was

189
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,360
controversial enough that it was and I was student at the U of O was a grad student later he came

190
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,240
through on some kind of a speaking thing and and it was controversial this would have been the

191
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:54,679
60s late 50s yeah late 50s and in fact he was a little aside stories kind of interesting you know

192
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:02,759
in our life of Trinity there's a picture of Linus hanging in the Dan and you know for other

193
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:11,240
dignitaries and this would have been in the early 50s and his picture was taken down by some

194
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,680
of the members hidden away somewhere it just disappeared because of this you know it's the attack

195
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,640
from the the right and yeah I don't think it phased Linus at all I think he just plowed on through

196
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:31,720
you know I don't know so he you know he knew he wanted to do he did his you know everlasting credit

197
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,240
and he and your dad maintained a connection over the years or he and your dad maintain a

198
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,240
connection uh loose loose connection I don't think it was ever you know there was a uh history

199
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,920
there at early days which you know you don't you remember those things but I don't think there was

200
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,559
much you know correspondence or much contact because he was you know operating in a entirely different

201
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:01,640
different level yeah well back to your dad in the early days in Corvallis he coached

202
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,280
freshman track for four years too uh I think that's right I don't have all of that during his

203
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,600
own and some of those uh information I gave him I think that was probably his first coaching job

204
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,360
was uh was track did he maintain an interest in track over the years yes he did yeah he uh he

205
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,920
loved he loved helping with track needs and uh helping put them on ice school track needs so he was

206
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,920
yeah that was his first athletic love I think he's also an outstanding golfer

207
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,360
hmm yeah we became the head baseball coach there in the 1920s but it was a different situation

208
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,720
back then that is now how do you mean well he's essentially a volunteer job for one oh right

209
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,560
right right I'm not sure it was a big job I think he often often said that it was not he was paid

210
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,840
you know to be an administrator teacher in the physical education department and academic

211
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:59,559
point up there so baseball was just sort of an aside it wasn't a very uh I don't think high-powered

212
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:07,959
program there's photos in this thing it's show the baseball field in 1920 there isn't even a backstop

213
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,519
you know walled walls there and you see the egg building and the heating plant with the

214
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:20,759
chimney and all that but nothing else is around there so it was very you know low-key operation

215
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,559
and uh he uh he didn't want to be paid for it largely because he said that uh didn't there be an

216
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:37,160
expectation you know he didn't want that he wanted to be able to do this as uh as a hobby you know

217
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,879
that's a fun thing and it was and uh got him a lot of notoriety you know made him a lot of

218
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:47,799
friends and a lot of fun for him but he didn't want the they eventually didn't start paying him

219
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:53,319
you know years later but it was not a big and big amount of money that wasn't his job that wasn't

220
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:59,319
how he made his living and I always thought that was kind of shrewd you know uh coaches get fired

221
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,879
because they don't perform and uh he didn't want that you know get find somebody if you get

222
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:10,759
somebody for the price you're getting me for go for it yeah but he didn't coach non-stop from 1922

223
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,519
on he ever several periods there when he was had other administrators uh do these in the 30s

224
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,079
slash guild coach I think for about six years yeah that was fascinating to discover a

225
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:28,200
slash guild also baseball catch yeah but it was a very low key sport uh like I say 20 games maybe

226
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,920
if they were lucky and they just played local teams was there any recruiting at all or I don't

227
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,079
know or my dad recruited he would recruit locally scout around high school kids in the summer

228
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:51,480
so nothing like nothing like today light years you know are there any scholars that he saw for

229
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,159
back then uh I think by the time I got there in the 50s I think there were some there were some

230
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,039
scholarships they'd have a handful it split up into little pieces most I think they were you

231
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,960
had to work for them in those days if you were getting a a stipend ride they call it years you

232
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,440
had to put in a certain number of hours you know cutting grass or doing something and you know

233
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:20,680
they made us they we had to do that well tell me about how his his coaching career evolved over time

234
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,279
I mean the baseball became more formal and he became more established the program became more established

235
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:34,600
well it was just an evolution I don't know if they uh they were long time rivalries or some great

236
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:41,000
pictures of one picture in their book Bailey kicking the bucket you know water spraying out

237
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,240
and so they were and Oregon they were you know lots of good rivalries there and uh people like the

238
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,879
game uh but it just developed and got you know and they're beginning the northern division was there

239
00:27:53,879 --> 00:28:00,759
and then eventually in the 50s late 40s they formed a it was the southern division the California

240
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:06,440
schools rise there we didn't play them and then in that era they started to play postseason

241
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,359
games the college world series came along and by 1946 or 47 something like that

242
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,440
storage W Bush was captain of the first Harvard team I think they won the college world series

243
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:27,879
it was the first baseball George H. W. Bush first first first H. W. Yeah not W. H. W.

244
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:35,000
great so uh college baseball got a big shot in the arm when that national competition started

245
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:47,960
and they had good years and bad and uh it was a lot of fun at any point did he feel like that he

246
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:55,720
was baseball coach was his job and and the other job was less of his job or well yeah I don't think

247
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,480
so you always pay attention to where you're who signs the check and uh but baseball was what uh

248
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:09,079
you know got in his reputation and then his social thing and uh you know his players loved him and

249
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:17,160
everybody knew who he was and he's a very personable guy and I mean people responded to him and

250
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,279
liked him and so that makes life easy yeah it's only more about his personality you see he was an

251
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:30,359
intense competitor he said oh yes yes yes yes he just on the bench he was just a constant motion

252
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:36,920
you know throwing grass in the air and stilting up and down attacking the young players and

253
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:42,599
challenging calls you don't see that anymore at all you know but all the coaches used to do it back

254
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:50,920
you know in the 40s and 50s and 60s and uh and uh but after the game was over no problem he's

255
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,600
you know everything was fine but I think I think that was uh I was kind of a negative I mean your

256
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,200
coach is just constantly you know spinning out of control practically and your sports remain calm

257
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,680
and in control but uh you know his his intensity was infectious or question about it and you

258
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:18,759
want to win too well uh obviously Corvallis is in a rainy place and and baseball is played during the

259
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,359
spring when it's often rainy and wet do you never did he have a facilities component to his job too

260
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,039
I'm sorry what a taking care of the field you know obviously well that's yeah the players did

261
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,839
most of that because they were on a scholarship or ride and then we did a lot of that so you

262
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:41,319
can imagine what kind of shape that baseball field is in uh we used the armory for our spring

263
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,720
you know workouts and things and the season didn't start we didn't play any games until the start

264
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:55,960
of spring quarter now it's you know they played what 60 or 70 games a year now yeah we were lucky

265
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:03,799
if we played 25 or 30 and that was fine with me it's good to get the season over who want to do

266
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:15,480
other things well let's travel like back then no buses cars we took uh my senior year I guess it

267
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:27,960
was we took our first out of state trip spring break there's a week in there and so my dad

268
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,039
is scheduled to several games in California so we piloted these cars and took off for

269
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:43,240
California and played Stanford, Cal and Sacramento and Fresno and you know and we didn't have any

270
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,000
budget at all this was the first out of state trip you know except for the conference play the

271
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,880
first you know they do this routinely now they go all over the country you know playing in turn

272
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,120
of months and this was an interesting experience the I think it would have been 1953 probably

273
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:12,440
and we'd pull into some town like uh oh Berkeley we'll play Cal and my dad is say okay

274
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:23,640
the game we have to feel tomorrow at noon games at 2 30 or something be there to see yeah we were on our own

275
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,039
we never hotel we didn't have anything we I think we had some meal money I think you might have

276
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,319
given us some meal money but um and we were supposed to fend for ourselves we did by staying

277
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:42,039
in fraternities you know you know I fall in and call it the U House and say you know I'm down

278
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:48,279
here with the Oregon State baseball team and we come and camp there for a couple days oh sure

279
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,159
and also with the guys that weren't in fraternities we just bring them along you know pretend like they

280
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,319
were so that's how we got by in Fresno we finally stayed in the hotel because I think he wanted

281
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:06,679
to know where everybody was when they came time to go home but other than that we were just uh

282
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:14,359
just freelancing it that's I can't compare that to the day they have everything but they're private jet you know

283
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,799
how did the how did the colonel feel itself it wasn't called colonel feel them and how did

284
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:26,359
it change over time well I think you just got just fell into the usage you know uh

285
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,879
I uh before it was dedicated you know formally dedicated yeah uh just

286
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,920
did he have to raise some funds do you do you recall to have improvements made or

287
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,520
I don't recall anything like that I think it was just uh based on what the what the athletic

288
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,200
department would provide potentially they put a backstop up they put a backstop up yeah we had

289
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,880
we had seats bleachers and all that kind of thing but it was uh it was pretty primitive there

290
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,080
were no fence out in the outfield oh really no and uh and the ground was hard and

291
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,519
while we got past the outfielders it was all run but you couldn't hit one out of the park they were

292
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:15,079
all inside the park oh yeah so that was a meter interesting you know addition to the to the

293
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:22,840
challenges so you wanted fast outfielders yeah you mentioned the training was pretty casual

294
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,160
yeah yeah there what really wasn't any you know we just started we'd work out the gym or the

295
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,960
armory and my dad's dress running because that was especially for pictures because that was

296
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,920
you know good for you but uh no you know half the team probably smoked including my dad and uh

297
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,039
that was just you know we take smoke breaks during the game under the stands I love the buses

298
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:50,840
and things like that so a little more casual yeah and this is both teams with a giant for the

299
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,760
smoke break right well yeah I guess I haven't thought of that but we were on the first base side in

300
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:04,120
those days now they're on the third base side and uh down up the south end of the field they

301
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,960
knew the wooden football stadium stands that went around there I don't know if you think of

302
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,720
that yeah they'll feel there was we go down under there and then stand so you know be out of the

303
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,760
yet sides it wasn't it was this was a schedule before the game where it says some signal when

304
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:29,480
out there was time for a smoke break in between getting you know well his most successful team was

305
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,480
probably 1952 the team that won the PCC championship in the Western Regional which of the call

306
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,760
at the World Series in Omaha you were you're a member of the squad anyway right I was a member of

307
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,840
the squad it was actually Jay I was JVing at that year didn't play uh you know played against the

308
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,039
varsity and with them and practice in practice and things like that but no I didn't I didn't actually

309
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,120
played with the team and the numbers they took back to Omaha I think they were restricted so again it

310
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,720
was a fairly small squad there were players that played you know a lot of part of the season that

311
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:16,839
didn't didn't go back they got hammered they lost the first two games it was hot and so on but they

312
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:23,480
got there that was amazing didn't make it back for another what 30 years or 35 years or something

313
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,759
like that well do you remember much about that that season I mean it sounds like it was sort of

314
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:34,599
magical season well things came together and some really good athletes uh those days

315
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:43,319
it was uh very common for if for guys to play more than one sport and uh let me see our

316
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:55,079
catcher was a starting end with the first baseman was a starting forward second baseman was a

317
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:02,119
starting guard the basketball team the third baseman was a linebacker football linebacker left

318
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:08,119
fielder was another tight end and so I think out of if you took away the pitchers I think there were

319
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:16,199
three starters on that team that didn't start for some other team so without those guys we

320
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:21,480
have been helpless you know so yeah you could play and they love that they love baseball because I

321
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,880
got them out of spring football and that sort of thing so they're all wonderfully baseball

322
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,599
and it was a fun sport what do you remember hearing about the the Omaha trip obviously didn't go

323
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:38,280
all the field but it was well I think they went by train long train the very hot while they were

324
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:45,720
there um Omaha you know in the at time of year it could be pretty pretty bad and uh I don't think

325
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,320
their accommodations were very good is it I think it was only about the if you've fifth or sixth year

326
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:57,000
of the college real series so I don't think they really gotten their rhythm down yet and uh

327
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,800
there I remember them talking about the heat they couldn't sleep and we had these heavy wool uniforms

328
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,800
just one uniform you want something warm as you played out here but back there it just was totally

329
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,440
you know inappropriate I think that hurt them you remember it being a big deal with they had made

330
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:22,679
the world series on campus oh yeah yeah we played the we played USC uh so the Cal we were the

331
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,119
Perennial champions and we played them in in play them in Kerala so we played them in Los Angeles

332
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:35,320
the year before they beat us down there we got them again in Kerala so 52 and I think we had

333
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:42,280
5,000 people there they put the stands up you know drag them in from all over and huge crowd

334
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,440
it was a big deal yeah that must have meant something else it was great fight

335
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,840
um a couple of no warry players that I came across maybe you can comment on do you know

336
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:03,480
much about West Schoenrich yeah I knew West um he was uh lived over in the coast I think uh

337
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:11,079
over on the Ness Tucka and it was a fishing guide and an outdoor type of guy and he'd come to all

338
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:20,119
the games big burly you know voice through this guy and uh it was also a great football player

339
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,079
I don't know if he played in the pros or not but he was he did play pro baseball he did play

340
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,880
major league baseball for the Philly sand another name I came across was Ed Coleman it called

341
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,519
them right yeah his half brother it was several years younger and played for the warry state and

342
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,480
really good career in the majors he played about five or six years and uh they played for

343
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,840
the Portland Beavers after that he was uh he had a good career he's in uh he was in the record

344
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:59,000
books for a while he was a great pinch hitter he'll the American league pinch hit season single

345
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,440
season pinch hit record for about 30 years or something so he had a good success athletic family yeah

346
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,720
did you don't have a particular styles of coach and any sort of philosophy of baseball I mean

347
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,880
we pat kc is famous for a small ball approach was there anything like that

348
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:28,680
uh just beat the other guys up you know that 52 team was a good he was the guy for huge you know

349
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,280
the starting four were just six five and uh football players were six three six four for the day

350
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:41,640
these guys were huge it's big pitchers and everything physically and uh we would make sure that

351
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,320
when we take batting practice before a game that was always pretty game rituals since each team

352
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,840
take batting practice you watch the other team you know hit and we make sure that the bigger the bigger the

353
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,559
bigger the guys were this earlier they got out and hit so we dropped these great big guys out you know

354
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,720
and uh they'd be in the ball all over the place and it was intimidating you know so yeah he

355
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,559
liked that kind of a team you know so he didn't we didn't play much small ball I think the idea was just the

356
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:24,199
you know overpower yeah who are some of your dad's best friends in corralis well he was there for

357
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:29,559
a very long time as you say is a popular guy the only belong to all the clubs along the yorks club

358
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:36,599
and the rotary club and you know if there was a club he'd join it and uh most of the close friends

359
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:44,519
we had there were a lot of them in the department the land teams dixons other coaches

360
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:52,279
slaskyo you know we just uh line Steiner the role close friends the absolutely the coaches

361
00:41:54,279 --> 00:42:02,679
and he had close friends just among the townspeople he was a small town boy and uh and uh liked

362
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,759
you know the small town associations what was your impression of slaskyo uh terrific guy I like

363
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:16,119
slats a lot I used to cady for him and he'd always give me two bucks I think that was uh

364
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:23,319
so and he had two kids who were a little younger than me but of course we I knew them and

365
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:29,159
everything slas was a really good guy he just you know found his niche and stayed in it

366
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:36,279
and just you know did great and uh they'd be on they'd be you know standard participants in the annual

367
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:42,119
beach trips and the parties and and hunting and fishing and they they did all this stuff you know

368
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:48,920
all the coaches and uh people did all these things together no slasks was uh uh

369
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:52,199
you know really uh really a good guy

370
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:57,399
trying to think there was something else I was going to say about him like I remember what it was

371
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:08,199
oh maybe a little anecdote you may not know uh UCLA uh was looking for a basketball coach

372
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,719
and they ended up hiring John Wooden but uh slasstered it down

373
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:19,719
his teams had beaten them UCLA two years in a row over the championship so

374
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,919
uh he'd be decided to he'd come out with us I don't think they'd get off or any kind of money

375
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:29,799
but he used to say to stay out he grew up in Salem so he was a young very much a local

376
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:42,839
local boy so Wooden went on to become you know a legend and uh but slats preferred the smaller arena

377
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,880
uh how about Lon Stiner and did you know him all oh yeah yeah Lonnie was just a really nice guy

378
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:58,200
he was lots of fun and we go hunting and fishing you know my dad and Lonnie and uh and he just he liked

379
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,320
he was he you know when you're a kid you know when there's people growing up so like you and

380
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,640
others that are just kind of going to the motions you know and Lonnie really liked uh like

381
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:14,119
people like kids this is the terrific guy well it sounds like outdoors were important to this group

382
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:20,679
of men were there are hangouts that they they frequented besides the lodges

383
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:26,839
the Welsh club primarily that was the place where everybody gathered and it was right in the center

384
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:32,679
of town at the time uh they didn't know if the building is still there but it was right you know on

385
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:39,159
third street or fourth street and so this was just the focus for all uh social activities in

386
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:44,519
town that moose and others but the else club was the one that most people you know frequently

387
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:50,039
my sense of the athletic department during your dad's time is of a pretty tight net group

388
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:56,359
that accurate you think yeah I think so yeah Paul Dundee of course he came in in late 30s

389
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,719
played basketball and then navy and then came back and never left he still went right

390
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:10,199
I think his name is in the ball school he was the J.B. baseball coach was he not he was he was the

391
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:16,919
freshman he was the only assistant my dad had and I don't think he got paid but he was the tennis

392
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:23,719
coach system basketball coach and the system baseball coach so he was your coach is the J.B.

393
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:29,959
right right what was he like as a coach oh good guy you know baseball hadn't been his game but

394
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:37,559
it mattered you know he could manage it and then we played a game against the uh as a freshman

395
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:43,159
they had freshman teams in those days it only played three years of RC so you played your first

396
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:51,800
year as a freshman and we went over played the penitentiary you know in Salem they played a hole

397
00:45:52,600 --> 00:46:00,600
the zang was that they played a strictly home schedule so we were in there and it was fun you

398
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,360
know the let us in that there had been the penitentiary and you know the field was out in the corner

399
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:11,240
it was huge wall and the umpire was uh I was pitching the game actually and the umpire was

400
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:16,760
you know the convict and and so on and they were just on each other totally they'd bother us you

401
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:24,920
know but they were just razzing each other everybody had a nickname and so it was a it was a fun

402
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,000
experience uh I don't know the baseball I don't know if the prison grades I don't know if they still

403
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,920
have a baseball team or not we dad was also an official you fished at football and basketball

404
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:46,920
yes yeah and that was his it was a hobby I mean made money at it and uh yeah and quite a good

405
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:57,240
reputation he he was uh uh football official with several Rose Bowls and uh and yes that's

406
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,760
why he finally got out of that in the late 30s it was two more to physically demand me you know

407
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,560
the football and the basketball no he did a lot of many was um kind of commissioner for referees

408
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:16,760
for a while for the conference he would evaluate officials and rate them and the other things

409
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:24,440
they're overseer well he retired in 1966 and he mentioned he was a good golfer at C-Sing to

410
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,520
have turned his attention to golf at that well he always played golf like I'll take that back

411
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:33,400
he's I don't know when he started playing golf but uh he helped lay out the Dallas Country Club

412
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,079
really and uh it was really good and coached your taught golf you know your coach's golf when he

413
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:46,360
taught golf for years in physical education department or in state and uh played it a lot

414
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:54,280
and was good anything like that came easy to it you know when your athletic attempts to generalize

415
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:01,400
all areas and uh do you play golf uh a little bit do you know what a shank is

416
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:09,400
yeah well he developed the shanks the terminal case of the shanks and uh he uh didn't play for

417
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,360
about 15 years just walked away from the game totally he was a regular golfer you know a

418
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,720
couple times a week kind of thing and took the lessons and tried everything and uh this couldn't

419
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:25,239
couldn't get over it and then when he retired he kind of got him back into golf a little bit

420
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:31,239
when he retired they left Krovalis my mother and sold their house and moved to Woodburn

421
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:37,719
a senior stage and he was hired there as the golf to take over the golf program so yeah that was his

422
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:45,319
retirement venue yeah golf is important to him he liked that game again he was so competitive that

423
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,360
it's kind of you know you can't be overly good you can't try too hard you know and go off as a game

424
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:59,640
you have to play below your you know your maximum effort yeah and so I think that that was uh

425
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:10,280
kind of uh made it harder do you know anything more about the the laying out the country club

426
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:18,519
I mean just didn't that story uh only that uh they planted all those uh they planted fur trees

427
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,480
laid out the course I don't know what it was with the then the members and the volunteer

428
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,200
the volunteer and they planted all those fur trees in the rough and it was only nine holes

429
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,720
you know begin with and uh very yellowy and clay and it's just like concrete you know to play it so

430
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:47,159
that was laid out in uh probably mid-twenties so he was a charter member then I think probably was yeah

431
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:58,119
probably pretty close um well Colmanfield is dedicated as such in April 1981 I'm sure that meant

432
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:03,639
something to him you do you have memories of that particular moment that that event yeah my

433
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:10,359
older son and I went down and um and were there there's pictures and documentation

434
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:18,759
you know in the material that this there and uh Robert McVicker was the president and uh Jack

435
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:25,000
Riley was the coach and it was during I think it was secondary to a game I can't remember exactly

436
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,319
I think it was very nice event and then the speed she was a very good presenter

437
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:40,920
and um could tell jokes there's I think uh I don't think it's any record of what he said at that

438
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,200
event but there's some other information there's some he would write it out ahead of time so there's

439
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:54,840
some things in there he said but he could uh he was good good on his feet do you think I meant

440
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,880
though I tell him that the field had been named after him officially oh I think so yeah we wouldn't

441
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:08,119
you know that was uh that was a source of pride and she uh nice honor for him and after that it

442
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:13,400
sounds like he got another job in baseball the Portland Marrow's I think are you familiar with the

443
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:21,640
history of the Portland Marrow's okay well he uh big Russell who was an actor western actor

444
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:27,720
the Portland Beaver franchise and then kind of left bacon he picked this up for practically nothing

445
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:33,959
I think it was partly due for light of venue for Kurt his son Kurt Russell to play who was quite

446
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:40,359
a active baseball player and the Mavericks were independent the own team they were owned by any other

447
00:51:40,919 --> 00:51:46,439
majorly team or anything like that and these were just free agents some pros some amateurs and uh

448
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:52,359
being Russell hired somebody to manage the team and he would be around these players up

449
00:51:53,320 --> 00:52:00,039
and they played and they uh it wasn't AAA it was uh I mean a double A level down Mama City

450
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:09,480
and I think there's a movie being made about you know books for things like that and uh they were a

451
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:21,880
very flamboyant you know bunch and uh and uh when at one point Frank Peters then he was an

452
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,680
Oregon State baseball player basketball player played on that final four basketball team

453
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,079
and it played professional baseball and he was hired as the manager

454
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:42,280
and uh he hired my dad to be his third base coach because he played for my dad and so

455
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,800
there's a Mavericks hat around the house somewhere so he spent two or three seasons you know

456
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:57,640
helping you know manage the four Mavericks that was later on we were pretty late in his life right yeah

457
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:05,720
okay so let's turn the attention to you now um you were born and raised in Corvallis and

458
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,480
I just didn't know the Corvallis that you knew growing up as a boy small town all the way

459
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,400
everything just revolved around the campus summertime everything just quit everybody just

460
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,280
tanned at their yards and laid around and you know they didn't have much in the way of summer school

461
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:29,720
oh they did have a summer school and one of my dads the assignments was to work with the summer

462
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:37,800
students and setting up field trips they go to you know uh the bodybuild dam with Timberline

463
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:44,200
Modge and over the coast and he organized he just loved this kind of thing you know and so but it was

464
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:52,119
uh it was a nice place to be in the summer very little was going on and uh the the Corvallis calendar

465
00:53:52,919 --> 00:53:59,319
was Oregon State's calendar you know the New Year's Day was when schools started in the fall

466
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:06,359
like it wasn't in wasn't in January because everything just focused on the activities on campus and

467
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,359
most everybody you know worked for the camp college one you know directly you're indirectly

468
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:17,559
and it wasn't an excuse for Corvallis being there but I haven't been for Oregon State so

469
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:22,039
and it was it was uh it was a very nice uh place to grow up

470
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:30,599
campus was our playground uh the kids you know we just we knew how to get into every building and uh

471
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:37,880
in the everything you know we needed to get into and uh our parents didn't know what we were doing

472
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:43,720
I don't think they wanted to know what we were doing but so it was a it was a playground

473
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,680
as you got a little bit older and to say the high school age were were the places that the kids

474
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:57,400
congregated you mean him Corvallis yeah well there was some there was some uh there was some

475
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:04,920
drive-ins and there was a drive-in theater up between Albany and Corvallis there was a fun place to be

476
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:11,079
there were places downtown restaurants I don't remember having any particular it was kind of like

477
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:17,000
American graffiti did you see remember American graffiti and that was a lot like Corvallis was a lot

478
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:26,280
like the American graffiti you know ambiance very nice place to grow up and everybody kind of had their

479
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:34,680
their their activities you know everybody garden their mothers all collected antiques and

480
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:41,880
blade bridge and most of the mothers didn't work faculty wives there weren't jobs first of all who

481
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:50,840
wasn't uh I don't think it was considered uh quite socially acceptable for mothers to be working

482
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,760
it was kind of kind of an admission that you needed the money you know what I mean

483
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:03,400
so there everybody had lots of time there wasn't much there weren't very many organized activities

484
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:10,360
you know we kids we just did what we wanted to do and say well the home for dinner you know when

485
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:17,720
that was it so what sort of impact do you remember the depression having on the town it sounds

486
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:25,799
like the the faculty refer little on the economic impact but well that that was my impression you

487
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:30,439
know I didn't I wasn't you hardly aware of the depression it was just the way things were

488
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:40,519
that I was born in 1931 of course that's just when it was in its worst and it didn't affect the

489
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:47,400
university college that met much everybody I don't think they had much of the way of cutbacks

490
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,559
I think although I can't couldn't document it there were times when they did not get paid at all

491
00:56:53,559 --> 00:57:00,280
but the state they were given IOUs and I think they were honored later on but that was it was

492
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:10,199
it kept breathing and of course there were migrants in Krabalus and I show up at our back door

493
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:17,159
and want food and that sort of thing so it was it was there and of course World War II came along

494
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:22,359
and ended that and I heard well that's my next question is well how did this how did the town

495
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:26,039
respond to World War II what was it like during that period of time well of course the

496
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:35,960
there were no men around they had a a a STP programs anything to it was an army sponsored

497
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:44,199
program for soldiers to go to college and I think they became officers at the end of it so there's

498
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:51,240
an STP program but these are soldiers essentially assigned to that role and as far as men went on

499
00:57:51,240 --> 00:58:02,440
campus that was about yet the women lived in the fraternity houses and the school kept going but

500
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:10,039
you know the war was having a big impact on it was a dare and the midst of its

501
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:19,800
yes it was yes the camp of dare was had a huge impact on Krabalus and Albany and it

502
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,159
you know it was a basic well you know of camp of dare was for basic infantry infantry basic

503
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:32,920
training I think they put forward divisions infantry divisions through their three or four

504
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:40,279
years it was right and that's a lot of soldiers and we had we had one living in our house we always

505
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:46,199
had one living in our house with us not but they get back we didn't have soldier living there we had

506
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:54,359
his wife living there in our spare bedroom and this was pretty typical the wives would follow the

507
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,360
the soldiers out to be around through their basic training and these guys would get released from

508
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,840
you know camp of dare for a weekend or something and hear them clump up the stairs at night you know

509
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:14,760
GI boots and down the next morning and so that was pretty standard too so the city was you know

510
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:21,640
supporting that effort my mother was a great lady that's kind of a nurses auxiliary

511
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:31,239
volunteer at a hospital at Campodare and and they were at uniforms they worked in the military

512
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:38,759
or anything but they would write letters for soldiers and keep them company in the hospital

513
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:46,599
so she did that during the whole war this is a volunteer we were able to go out there and all

514
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:53,319
of that off limits I don't remember going on the base during the war afterwards again once the war

515
00:59:53,319 --> 01:00:00,279
was over why did I think that back we didn't go out there because we were in the gym doing something oh

516
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:08,920
I know yeah my dad had during what the construction of it they had a baseball league or softball one

517
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:18,440
two and my dad coached one of those teams the construction teams and so I was on the camp of

518
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,840
dare a couple times and one time we were in the gym I guess it would be and there was a whole slug of

519
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:34,680
POWs in there we were storing POWs at Campodare during the war and these were African Corps

520
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:42,679
guys Germans and by the way they were a tough looking bunch and then there were also Italians

521
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:47,719
around and they were so you know they were more open and friendly and stuff so they were being

522
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:54,759
housed there I don't know if they ever escaped or not but they didn't look like the security was

523
01:00:54,759 --> 01:01:00,519
very tight they had a pretty well pretty good as it was that's interesting I hadn't known about that

524
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,840
the expansive of it there is amazing when you see it now the expansive of it there is it was

525
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,599
amazing when you see it now it's quite and it's there's not a lot there it was used to be the

526
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:17,639
second biggest honor in Oregon it was huge covered maps they had a artillery range the camp

527
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:23,400
of dare a lot of it egregious for an artillery range and we get you're blooming away over there

528
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,039
you mentioned in your memoir that the family traveled to San Francisco for the world's fair in 1939

529
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:37,559
you remember that at all oh yeah that was a great outing we stayed with my great aunt

530
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,239
lived in San Francisco and yeah that was a nice nice event

531
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,159
you taste your own a lot of artifacts from that

532
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,800
well tell me about high school in Corvall's high school you were the senior class president

533
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,679
I wasn't indeed and had a lot of fun in high school you know

534
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:05,400
I did not a lot of people don't have good experiences in high school but I had good experiences

535
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,440
you know everything wasn't a hundred percent but you know I was on the baseball team and the golf team

536
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:19,559
and you know had good friends and had a nice time we won the state high school basketball

537
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:25,159
championship I was in junior I wasn't on the team but that doesn't get any better than that when

538
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:29,319
in high school you know to have the win the state basketball championship

539
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,199
we made the decision to go to Oregon State College it sounds like there was there wasn't

540
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:44,039
much of a decision I mean no that was kind of dead that was you know I can't think of anybody in

541
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:52,679
my class high school graduate class that did go anywhere else you know initially and there

542
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:59,000
was a lot of faculty kids in Corvall's obviously so they were going to go to college but that was

543
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:04,279
closest one and the most affordable so that's kind of what we all ended up

544
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:07,879
what was it like playing in your dad's baseball program

545
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:20,919
fine had a great had a great time and it was you know no stress everybody accepted it and had a good time

546
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:27,000
yeah that seems to be the real honor you know for me yeah

547
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,079
you played summer baseball yeah that's what everybody did in those days

548
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:42,680
there was on the baseball team because the you know my dad we want we want to be playing and he

549
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:51,319
want you know he's he's players be playing too and we'd be hired we'd be sent out these small

550
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:58,599
towns every town had a baseball team a semi pro baseball team which means semi pro means professionals

551
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:04,359
ex-professionals could play on the team back in those days that was a no-no in terms of

552
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:11,639
amateur status who were supposed to play with pros but they made an exception for baseball so

553
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:18,759
these town teams that have some ex pros and some college guys and some locals and uh

554
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:25,559
he was a big deal for the town and they get his jobs you know we're going to the woods or

555
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:29,879
pulling on the green chain or something like that and it was about what was out there

556
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:36,679
in the mill pond job I was not that was not uh I was living in Corvall's that summer and they gave

557
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:45,079
me a big you know that was a summer we went to uh Air Force basically or not anyway uh that was a

558
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:53,480
mill south of Monroe you know Monroe is and had big mill pond and yeah that was a that was a

559
01:04:53,480 --> 01:05:02,039
dangerous job and a tough one will tell some more about what that job until well uh every saw

560
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:11,480
mill had a mill pond where they would store logs and uh and you would the logs will be brought up

561
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:18,920
to the uh where there was a conveyor belt and then we then lifted and uh conveying into the

562
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:24,599
sawmill and cutting the boards and uh people have moved the logs around we're called pound

563
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:29,320
pond monkeys and you're out there in your court boots and you're big pole and all with

564
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:36,360
and uh trying to corral these logs and uh you know push it across the pond and get them over to the

565
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:44,280
where they could be picked up and they're about five of us and the pond monkeys and none of us knew

566
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:51,000
what we were doing and they dumped the logs and one end of the pond of log trucks and then we

567
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:59,000
gathered up five or six of these or gave them a raft and propelled across the across the pond

568
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:04,519
and then uh haven't lifted up there were a couple of uh professional pond monkeys there they

569
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:10,119
were just split around you know and uh fly across the logs and we were in the water half the time

570
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:18,599
interesting experience and this terrible water you know like I said my mother wouldn't let me

571
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:24,119
even the house you know and come over you smell some bad yeah so that's what we did that was those

572
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:30,920
the jobs are available minimum wage no unions you know so you're just totally the mercy of the

573
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:39,159
you know owner but there you guys that was you know that was a career for a lot of people

574
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:46,920
for us at least it was just a summer experience and so it was a great incentive to uh believe me

575
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,759
you know to stay in college and find something better because that's where a lot of these guys

576
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,520
spend their lives you know pulling on the green chain and this sort of thing probably that's

577
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:05,480
some interesting characters I'm sure yeah and then that was spent summers in coquillo and Brookings

578
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:13,960
doing that those sorts of jobs played for their town team some rough and tumble towns they were

579
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:23,960
indeed cowboys and Indians and fishermen and loggers and you were ahead he spent that summer in

580
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,760
primal too right primal I see coquillo Brookings and primal those are my three stops yeah

581
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:40,760
well you know to tell two Slot too I was yeah I was a legacy and uh looked at other houses but

582
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:48,360
they had a nice combination I thought of athletes and scholars and weest rules you know

583
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,920
didn't take themselves too seriously that were you know a good bunch of guys and uh so I never

584
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:00,920
had regrets about that that worked out pretty well nice nice group um you mentioned that

585
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,560
a particular fraternity I don't know if practice the right word for it but there's a story

586
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:13,320
involving skimmers view in Oregon yeah you just said Oregon no they had a we had a genius for

587
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:20,760
they're coming up with stuff like that uh no that's a true story and uh when I was a freshman

588
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:26,519
my freshman class I didn't have to go on that but they went down and blew a piece of it off they

589
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:34,119
didn't get the whole thing but they did die in my some of it off you know skimmers do never get caught

590
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:39,960
made it back and uh two years later went back and really you know got the whole thing this time and

591
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:48,680
it was uh it uh they also got the way with that you know the FBI was interviewing everybody on campus

592
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:57,479
and I'll try to get a handle on who his dynamite was considered you know a dangerous substance

593
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:01,880
and they steal it from the stump blasting class during the state you know the egg school and

594
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:09,880
some basketball class so these guys steal dynamite the caps nutty you know just nutty but uh

595
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:17,239
it uh they never caught out he did it this is the big oh that's the big oh and it's a big

596
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:25,960
concrete oh and then then the uh the guys that didn't went back later and they'd gather up pieces

597
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:31,079
chunks of it and everybody had it in the house had a chunk of this oh when they're on their

598
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:36,279
desk the paint don't know it was about that thick you know I mean paint is we we we were back in

599
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:41,880
the calmer days you know or you state would be down in painted orange and then or you get to get

600
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:47,000
the next day and paint it yellow so that it happened a lot but I think that was the last time that

601
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:55,559
you ever got uh you never got blown up the last time I never but here's the little interesting

602
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:02,280
side story I was not at a game in Watson one time years and years later and uh and I was

603
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,240
relating this story you know about my fraternity being a dynamite of the old uh

604
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:15,240
skater being a guy behind me he says came around he says is that a true story did you you know

605
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,080
you read the guys that did that and I said yeah and he said I wrote my master's thesis on that

606
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:27,640
on the time of the old so it was a story that you know had legs at least

607
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:37,319
well what was social life like for you in school uh rich no very good or you state was a nice

608
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:43,000
friendly place and there were too many men and not enough women you know student body it was

609
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,159
mostly you know egg school the engineering school and all that so men out the women but uh

610
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,840
it was good you had a lot of fun it was uh if you lived on campus with most of us did

611
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,159
you lived in our fraternities you were not like a different universe you know your parents were

612
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:03,079
glad to have you out of the house and you were glad to be out of the house and you might as well be

613
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:09,720
in Chicago you know the amount of interaction at this place just wasn't any yeah what sorts of

614
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:15,960
events were important on the social calendar all house dances you know I said one major

615
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:23,960
every house that had one major house dance every quarter and those were big events and uh

616
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:30,280
you know if you were dating somebody you'd get invited to her house dance and she invited you to

617
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:35,720
invite her yours and so on so there's a lot of that and a lot of beer drinking at a

618
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:42,199
Murphy's Beach and Murphy's Beach is you know South of town there's a tabern we've got about

619
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:46,280
two or three miles out of town on the right hand side and a whole Murphy's. Yes go Murphy's okay

620
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:52,440
well just pass that half a mile there's a road that goes off to the east

621
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,119
off of the highway down to the river and I think there's I don't know what's down there now but

622
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:03,720
back then it was a gravel operation and this is where all the parry took place because

623
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:09,000
it's called a birth speech and nothing to do with the tabern what that was where everybody gathered

624
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:16,680
it's a new one of me that's a new one for me oh yeah that was that was the place and you know

625
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:23,960
if anybody wanted to do a you know a rest of the Sir Haslis raining we everybody knew where we were

626
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:30,280
and it wasn't just my fraternity everybody was out there you know the football team the basketball

627
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:35,399
team everybody you know so a lot of party going on I don't think nothing has changed I don't think

628
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,319
we played baseball in the springs and springs in the summer did you do anything in the fall

629
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:46,279
or winter to get ready for the season or is it just being a whole student I think once the season was

630
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:55,639
over we were done I don't remember any particular each each season you know each football

631
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:01,160
football season basketball season baseball season they had a start to stop time and you know we

632
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:08,920
have guys that played three sports and throwing a state three major sports and started each

633
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:17,079
year every team so you can do that then and I don't think that's can they do that now I don't think so can

634
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,360
I think very few do if they could yeah

635
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:30,279
now how about school how about what was your academic experience like I was a moderate success modest

636
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:39,479
success I was in business administration and that wasn't a very stimulating major for me and but

637
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:47,000
you know I made my grades and I was only on probation once that's not too bad for four and a half

638
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:57,880
years so but I graduated any teachers about the main impact on you pardon any teachers you know

639
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:05,079
Gordon Gilkey Gordon Gilkey he was a good teacher

640
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:13,560
you know this is a long time ago can you tell me more about him I'm interested in Gilkey well Gordon

641
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:21,240
you know had he'd been in Europe during the Second World War and had one of those people that

642
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:29,880
participated in saving the you know uncovering the German stashes of art and so on and really made

643
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:37,480
a major contribution there and then he was a also a woodblock print collector and huge

644
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:45,799
Japanese woodblock collection and taught the course course surveyed visual arts or something anyway

645
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:52,439
it was a review of you know art and history and so on fascinating course and he taught that every

646
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:59,959
year and then later on he became Dean I think the liberal arts and I think so and he lived right

647
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:06,679
around the corner every retired or he stayed he's a good guy his son was there his son was a

648
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:16,680
photographer yeah yeah I'm asking a little bit about the climate on campus during the time you were

649
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:23,800
there you were there towards the end I think of the large influx of GI Bill students you're

650
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:29,960
mentioned in your memoir they were somewhat aloof oh yeah and I'm guessing that you have a

651
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,000
sense of why from your own military experience but can you talk a little bit about the GI

652
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,600
influence on campus why were there what was huge you know first there was a huge number of them

653
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,760
and then a lot of them married they're older these guys you know they weren't interested in

654
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:51,720
mourning booklets or any of that stuff that just went by the boards you know they weren't having any

655
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:56,680
of it you know these wanted to get in there and get their education and get on with their lives

656
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:03,319
and so that changed the whole campus tenor you know totally and then here along came my group you

657
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:09,159
went into the high school graduates and never you know you know you didn't want to do anything

658
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,920
and they all the upper the upper two classes in the fraternity house were all over two guys

659
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:22,599
and they ran the these they ran these fraternities like boot camps the the guy down the hall for me

660
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,519
one of the seniors I think it's a senior that by that time he bought a Kyle he then wound in the

661
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:36,760
battle of the bulge you know he didn't mess around with those guys you know and they didn't take any

662
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:43,000
you know very serious very business like and they were good role models you know we learned from

663
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,320
those guys so yeah they changed the whole campus philosophy has turned it upside down and then

664
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:58,280
they were I started in 1949 so they were kind of a tail end of it and ones that came along after

665
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:03,159
me not of us had ever been in the military so some occasionally where the Korean War came along

666
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:09,479
and that changed a lot a lot of things we had a lot of Korean War veterans around so that the

667
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:14,840
workloads tradition die out at that point I mean that was very strong before then what's that

668
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:20,519
the workloads and things like that that sees to me yeah that just sort of I think people tried to

669
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:25,559
get it back in place but if I don't think it everybody it wasn't the same as it had been

670
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:31,960
and things were changing anyway you know it wasn't just the World War II events the whole world had

671
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:38,440
changed you know the Second World War just changed everything old majors didn't matter anymore you know

672
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:45,000
and new technology was coming on and so the very revolutionary in retrospect you know very

673
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:54,680
revolutionary period well and you mentioned that some I'm trying to ask about the

674
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:00,200
subject of race and especially the example of the man who you write about in your book it is

675
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,440
not a revolution on campus funny stretch but it's an inkling of a very gradual change that's

676
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:13,079
going up going to come later in terms of the the topic of race it always you well or you say

677
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:20,360
it was a pretty pretty one race institution at the time we had we had black students from Africa

678
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:27,079
exchange students and Asians of course have been around for a long time so it wasn't totally

679
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:34,279
white but it was predominantly and there are no black athletes Oregon it had black athletes in the

680
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:48,839
30s football players Jackie Robinson's old brother Mac was a track man at Oregon and so Oregon

681
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:55,640
State was you know late to the game and Dave Mann was recruited out of California to come and

682
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:04,520
the Oregon State's first black athlete which he was and it was very successful and I didn't know

683
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:12,840
him very well personally but he was he was he stood out on question about it and he was he was not a

684
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:22,840
what would you call he was not a self-refacing person that a good way to put it but not a bad person

685
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:29,560
I mean he didn't cause any problems or anything he just he was new to you know this was a new

686
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:38,520
thing Oregon State and the Corvallus confident day yeah very confident a good athlete didn't take any

687
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:44,360
stuff you know you want a campus boxing tournament it was a passing idea there was a campus box

688
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:52,360
in tournament yeah it was well it was yeah it's a mural and yeah they just three three about three

689
01:19:52,360 --> 01:20:01,240
roundabouts yeah he won that was this is a period of time where there were many concert hats on campus

690
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:07,080
still were and what was that like did you have did you have classes in them or you know I don't

691
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:13,319
remember having I think they're mostly used for office space meeting rooms and things like that

692
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:19,319
they weren't big enough for you for a classroom such as reflective of a period of expansion on

693
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:26,119
campus influx of new students yeah I want to ask you about a couple things that happened at

694
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:34,439
at OSC during your time of 1950 Gil Carl C. Muppent remember do you remember that

695
01:20:34,839 --> 01:20:42,039
well I don't remember having any major event that you know it had been coming for a long time it

696
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:47,159
just didn't magically appear you know everybody knew it was it was coming it was yeah it was a big event it

697
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:53,879
was the state of the art at the time you know that was the Oregon State athletic facilities were first

698
01:20:53,879 --> 01:21:02,679
class Parker Field was new Oregon had riggedy wooden stands still when California schools had big

699
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:07,640
stadiums but you know Oregon State specialties were pretty good spec key was responsible for most of

700
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:14,840
that really do you have recollections of attending basketball games in the old men's gym yes I did

701
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:23,880
saw Slantfield's teams not going to UCLA twice in a row yeah get pulled to help 2,000 people

702
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:30,760
there was a balcony that ran all the way around the men's gym and you know the two

703
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,119
so yeah you know I start going there when I was probably four or five years old

704
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:45,560
it must have been quite an environment it was just athletics all the way you know how about football at

705
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:56,840
Bell Field well it was a mud bowl so it was you know and you were close to the field but the

706
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:04,199
student section was on the west side and in those days if you can believe it the co-wits all were

707
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:13,400
heels and stockings and pants dressed up for the game imagine that yeah that's amazing

708
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:20,039
well we sort of wind up here a little bit I'm interested in knowing about your continued

709
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:26,360
association with OSU after you graduated you obviously had a career in the military you

710
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:35,880
went on to other things and graduate studies in the career and well when I came my left-wing state

711
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:45,079
1954 spring of 1954 came back in 66 or 67 something like that and I lived in Chicago and

712
01:22:45,079 --> 01:22:49,880
Evanston and Lincoln Nebraska and Pennsylvania other places you know they kind of stopped your

713
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:56,680
name and then it was hired by Oregon Health Sciences University recruited by them to fill a certain

714
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:05,720
role they were looking for and came back and my dad had just retired for your stay so there wasn't

715
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:12,760
any of that overlap anymore but he was of course very closely involved and you know he had season

716
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,000
tickets so I just picked up going to the football games and you know that sort of thing

717
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:26,199
but that I wasn't you know a sociatel or you stayed in any direct professional capacity

718
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:35,399
but it was still part of our lives and then you know I was a lifetime member of the life

719
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:39,800
memory alumni association the varsio who was kind of kicking in a little bit they were getting

720
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:48,920
anything's going and then the baseball field project came on Pat Casey put that together and asked

721
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:57,560
me if I would be on their committee and did was and you know the fundraising committee and we

722
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:05,880
were successful largely because of the $1 million grant from God's John God's who sold a piece of

723
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:13,880
property and was going to be a huge tax bill so he decided to do something with it and that got

724
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:20,279
kicked Pat started and he'd probably been there this wasn't a you know he I don't know how many years

725
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:25,560
he'd been coaching but I'll bet it was close to 10 by the time a stadium project came along so

726
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,319
you know you think of the baseball project and I think the whole program is a project you know

727
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:38,519
so different from what it was you know back in the day it's patting over night success you know

728
01:24:38,519 --> 01:24:42,840
it just came in and waved the magic wand and they had but that's not the case at all he started

729
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:49,639
right from the ground zero and they didn't even charge for baseball games when Jack Wright was

730
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:57,000
there and even in Pat's early days he could just walk in anytime you know free and but he is a

731
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,479
I think a remarkable person a remarkable developer I think he would have done well and whatever he was

732
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:08,680
he you know the legendary state that he chose baseball but he had he's a talented person you know

733
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:16,039
not your normal just your regular everyday coach and he spearheaded this and we meet up here in Portland

734
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:24,119
and we you know tap people we knew and and there are some major donors that stepped up and

735
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:33,079
got a built so that was a huge that was a real sea change you know the baseball program to have

736
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:39,079
that facility it was interesting because prior to that time in Jack Riley and Tencelli and others

737
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:48,119
might have done something similar but until I wish one of the presidents it was it was after

738
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:55,559
the bigger probably burn could have been no one was it was after him even yes sir all

739
01:25:55,559 --> 01:26:03,880
research I think it was Paul research right said it would be okay to build a permanent facility on

740
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:11,000
that location but the University's policy prior that time that always been that this was too valuable

741
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,399
piece of property you know it is right not the center campus but it's right on campus and they

742
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:23,079
want to put dorms there and things like that well so they they wouldn't permit any kind of

743
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:30,760
improvement in the facilities nothing until the researchers said okay you do this and then that

744
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:38,119
opened the door for for Pat to go out and begin to and then John Goss coming along but those two

745
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:43,800
things came together made it possible to put a permanent facility on that site you know it's

746
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:49,960
the oldest baseball field in college baseball well it is the oldest or the second oldest I think

747
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:55,159
there might be some dispute about that but it's one of the two and somebody wandered out there one

748
01:26:55,159 --> 01:27:03,640
day in 1907 and drove a stake in the ground and this will be home played but it's never moved you know

749
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:09,480
it's it's been a big success I think that was good for Pat good for the program I think it made

750
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,800
a possible recruit and that's everything in baseball and Pat now with his reputation he just

751
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,520
recruits nationally you know he doesn't recruit he just answers phone calls basically

752
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:27,160
sounding success you know somebody said everything went to their one their first college

753
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:31,960
world series I mean what was your dad what was your dad feel about that yeah but he'd be proud

754
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:37,720
nicely he'd be dumbfounded this way would have been because you know considering the facilities

755
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:45,159
of the attitudes and so on so he's he's out of remarkable remarkable job yeah well the last

756
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:49,000
thing I want to ask you about is just your thoughts on the current direction of the university things

757
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,920
have changed mightily the last few years and there's a lot of momentum heading in different

758
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,480
directions what do you think of all this well I think Oregon State has got really a lot to be proud of

759
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:03,239
I think you know the current administration has really been in place long enough

760
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:10,839
I think it's been there's continuity there there was some you know most of presidents

761
01:28:10,839 --> 01:28:15,079
in state more than four or five years it's that you know they move on to other things but

762
01:28:16,839 --> 01:28:22,919
so I think that continuity has been important and I think they played the funding game very well

763
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:29,880
you know the technology grants and all this so I don't follow it with a microscope but

764
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:39,800
I don't think they have the reputation that they deserve I think it's not not really their fault

765
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:47,159
every every institution has areas of excellence and Oregon State is certainly no exception

766
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,239
but it's not the kind of thing that gets the headlines

767
01:28:54,039 --> 01:29:01,960
so but no I think I think it's a it's a really fine institution I know when my older son went

768
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,159
there and had a great time and so

769
01:29:10,039 --> 01:29:15,399
and they just completed a big fundraising campaign yeah just about a billion dollars billion

770
01:29:15,879 --> 01:29:22,439
yeah one of the better campaigns around the country I guess yeah yeah I think so yeah

771
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:31,960
so they do a good job I think I think Oregon State the Oregon State can be proud of

772
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:37,559
Oregon State and I think it's possible to get a good education there I think one of the things

773
01:29:37,559 --> 01:29:42,039
that was kind of a negative when I was there they had virtually nothing in the way of liberal arts

774
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:49,880
and you can only take two years the only operating liberal arts on the undergrad or the

775
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:56,600
lower division level and that that closed out a lot of you know it's an age when you really

776
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,479
ought to be looking around at you know other things and the opportunities weren't there and

777
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:06,279
you had to challenge yourself into one of these technical oriented majors and that wasn't always

778
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:13,159
a good fit for everybody so I think the fact that they expanded that you know that option is

779
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:18,039
I think adds a lot to it I think they really made that that returned the corner for them as far as

780
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:24,759
I was concerned when they developed liberal arts college and the good major and so on well Ralph I

781
01:30:24,759 --> 01:30:29,159
want to thank you for this it's been very interesting and fun and lightning for me well it's been

782
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:31,159
a real pleasure thank you very much okay
