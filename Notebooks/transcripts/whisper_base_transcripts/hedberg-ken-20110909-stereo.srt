1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now you can edit out any extraneous sounds like I have to clear my throat, not kind of stuff.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We can, yes.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Alright, so let's start if you would just introduce yourself, say your name on today's date

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and our location.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, my name is Kenneth Hedberg.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The date is September 9th, 2011.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, Ken, where were you born and where did you grow?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was born in Portland, Oregon in February 2nd, 1920.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And did you grow up in Portland?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, I actually know.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I spent my first six years of life there and then my father had a job that took him to Southern Oregon,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the Kusbe region, which is that time where we lived as called Marshfield.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And after that we moved to Hokkien, Washington, where I spent my years from age about 12 to 16.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Or upon me moved to Medford and I went to school, graduated from high school in Medford.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What were your parents' occupations?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, well, my mother was a housewife.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
During the war she worked at the Naval Station in that story.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My father was called a wholesale grocery salesman.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In those days, groceries were delivered by a truck from a large warehouse to the retailers.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And my father would travel to these small retail stores, some of them in outlying rural areas,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and take their orders for groceries, which he would then write up on a form in the late evening early in the morning,

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
take it to the warehouse and the orders would be filled.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the trucks would then take these groceries out to the various stores that had ordered them.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That, of course, passed pretty quickly in the time of better communications.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So that business is faded now.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So that was disappeared, actually.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That was a job that would require some moving around the family?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, well, my father had actually know that he changed jobs.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He worked for a company called Mason Urban, which is now out of business,

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and they had several stores, warehouses, and southern Oregon and Medford and Cuspe,

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and in Astoria, and he worked in all of these places.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For that company, as they move things around.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, these rural stores were, of course, separated wide intervals,

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and they were grouped together into what my father called a route.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I'm given the other week, he would go on a certain route, take him all day long,

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and the next day would go on a different one, and the third day, and so on,

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
for five, six days a week.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it was a lot of driving, and some of it over quite significant distances.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's about as much as I accompanied around a few of these drives,

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
just to keep him company, he seemed to like that.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But it was, from my point of view, pretty boring, if I'd sit in the car or go into the store,

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
while he took orders, and, of course, he'd have to stand around when the proprietor was waiting on customers,

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
because the customers were served first, so there's a lot of waiting and watching.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm glad I wasn't in that business.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you have any siblings?

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, I had a sister. She died about three or four years ago.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Her child, of course, removed as a family.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know, nearly as much. She moved in a different group than I did.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She was two and a half years younger.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So her high school group, her friends, were well behind mine.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we didn't have much of a social interaction as kids.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We just said different groups we were with all the time.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She went to Oregon State for a couple of years,

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and then the war came along, and she was a very good secretary.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So she dropped out of school and served as a secretary to a naval officer at the Naval Air Station in Astoria during the war.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And afterward, he set up a Ritter State business, and so she went to California,

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
served as the office manager for him, and she married a young man from the area.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And so she lived most of her life in San Francisco, in the San Francisco area.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
She retired over the...

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and the... I forgot what it was called, the tunnel from the Bay Area, across into the valley.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Pleasanton.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What were your hobbies as a boy?

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, in those days, we didn't have anything of the sort of thing they have now.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We had quite a lot of family interaction the evening.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I remember when my father was home early enough, and on weekends, we played family cards like Rummy and Pinocchio and things like that.

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The only source of entertainment apart from the movies was the radio.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And I can still remember my father and mother eagerly listening to certain programs in the radio among which were Amos and Andy.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you know that? Yeah. Amos and Andy. And a few of the other things.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And as for activity, I took up tennis when I was in Hokeham, and I played tennis all my life, including on the Medford High School team and on the OSU team when I came here later.

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So that was a hobby. And the other one was we had a lot of group of pretty closely knit kids in the neighborhood.

72
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And we played a lot of football, touch football on the streets.

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And that's mostly, oh, I collected stamps, but that was, you know, everybody collected stamps on those days.

74
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And that's about, I guess that kind of summarizes what it was.

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No cell phones, nothing, no TV, nothing like that.

76
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You were calling interested in science as a boy?

77
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was always good in school, although I never really realized that I skipped a couple of grades.

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:34,000
During the, my real interesting science developed, well, I was always interested in it, but it wasn't clear to me that I was going to be a scientist as a professional.

79
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And through high school and so on, science was always easy for me, both physics and chemistry.

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And when I lived in Hokeham, there were a number of people who always came to me with questions about science.

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Excuse me.

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't, we didn't have homework in the same way then, but it seemed to come so easily to me that I didn't have much trouble answering the questions.

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And then when I graduated from high school in Medford, it was in the height of the depression and my father had just lost his job.

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And we were, I graduated in 1937 from Medford High School.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And there was no employment at all for young people.

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There was summer employment, which I avail myself for several years.

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I worked in the orchards, picking pears in Southern Oregon.

88
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I did all this by hand, and that's about the only income that I had.

89
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's nothing that a young high school guy with no specific skills could earn money at.

90
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I moved along here and there for 25 or 50 cents. That's about the going rate then.

91
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But I made good money in the orchards when I worked there. It was very hard, back-breaking, hot, dusty work.

92
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But when your young man doesn't matter very much.

93
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So back to your question, after I graduated, I began to wonder what I was going to do.

94
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I know I wanted to go to college and my parents, neither of whom had gone to college.

95
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
In fact, my father finished the eighth grade and my mother graduated from high school. That was a limited of their education.

96
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Always told me they wanted me to go to college and said that they would match every dollar I could earn.

97
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, they pushed and put an end to that, of course.

98
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So one day I went to the Medford Public Library. I can still remember. And I walked in and that checked out a book in physics, elementary physics, and another one in chemistry.

99
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I took them home to read them. And the physics that was exposed in those textbooks of the day was pretty elementary stuff, mechanics, levers, and that sort of thing.

100
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The Manhattan Project had not a radioactivity. That sort of thing was something that didn't penetrate to the high school level or in the textbooks of the time.

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I finally decided I liked chemistry better.

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that started me on my career.

103
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I managed to, in 1939, in the winter of 39,

104
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
as my father, as I said, lost his job. And he was important living with his brother, trying to land another job.

105
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We had almost nothing in Medford, my mother, and my sister, and I,

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and I was able occasionally to provide a little bit of money for groceries.

107
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My father tried to send money, but at one point we were enough destitute so that the power company turned off all the electricity, and we cooked with a stove with some wood.

108
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And we had a camping lantern, a coal and lantern that we used in the evening in the house.

109
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We managed to avoid getting thrown out of the house, which is a rental in Medford, but just barely.

110
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So for some reason, I'm not able to, at this state, remember how or why, enough money was gotten together to allow me to register as southern, what was then called southern Oregon Normal.

111
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, it's southern Oregon University. It's southern Oregon State University, I guess. I don't know.

112
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And for ten cents a day, I had a friend with a car I could pay him, and I rode back and forth with him, stayed at home, and I registered for chemistry and a few other things, and took a number of courses in music.

113
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And that continued. I got all A's of first term. My father told me somebody in Portland had said, you know, there was a guy, Kenneth Hedberg, I noticed that got all A's of southern Oregon College.

114
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is that your son? My father knew nothing about this.

115
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I guess my mom didn't want to tell him that we had found money to send me to college, but the tuition was a bag of tell.

116
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You know, it was something like $20 or $25 a term at that point.

117
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So he said, no, that can't be my son. When it turned out it was, he was not angry. He was delighted, actually.

118
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I stayed the second term, and I got all A's except for one, which is a B in piano. I had taken a number of courses in music and harmony and composition and things which interested me.

119
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And at the end of that time, excuse me, this is going to show up on your, you're going to have to edit out these throat clearing.

120
00:14:40,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, at the end of that time, in the spring of 1939, my father actually got a job in Astoria, and he and my mother decided that rather than she going to Astoria to join him, she would move to Corvallas and allow my sister and me to matriculate at Oregon State.

121
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And she would set up a rooming house there. That rooming house would, we'd have three or four people staying with us. And she would do the cooking and so on, and the rent and things that she collected would enable us to maintain a house so my sister and I could go to school. That was done.

122
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:49,000
At the time, I didn't realize what a sacrifice that was, but as time has gone on, I can see that was a monumental contribution on their part because I wouldn't have been able to go to Oregon State at all.

123
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Excuse me. Well, that was followed through. And I had one scholarship, tuition scholarship, dualist use. So I didn't have any tuition to pay.

124
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And then the National Youth Administration was set up by Franklin Roosevelt, and this enabled students who qualified to earn 25 cents an hour. And I got a job in the chemistry department here at Oregon State handing out supplies to people who were in the laboratories.

125
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And that continued for 1941, 1940. And then 1940, my mother decided that we were now able to do this on our own.

126
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And so she moved. We closed the house and she moved to Astoria. And I had pledged a fraternity. And so I had a place to live and my sister moved into a co-op at Oregon State.

127
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And so I lived in my fraternity house for the rest of my career at OSU. I finished in December of 1942.

128
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Pardon?

129
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which fraternity were you in?

130
00:17:37,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I was in the state of Kay. It's still the same house. And in fact, fraternity rode there and not changed much at all. I guess the houses have been renovated. But my social connections with the fraternity are essentially zero.

131
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And I have a lot of professional connections that I've spent my energy with.

132
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What was your social experience like in college?

133
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, the social experience was tremendous. My grandson is just mature, is just enrolled at...

134
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't think he'll come in the minute, but anyway, he wrote back. He's a very studious guy. And it's superb, yeah, and he wrote back to my daughter that how much fun he was having.

135
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And she was greatly concerned that he wasn't studying. He just landed on the campus. Well, I told her that was my experience at OSU.

136
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't know how much is known about those days, but there was a lot of social life and the community was more strictly defined as the independence as they were called on the Greeks, which concluded all of fraternities and authorities.

137
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And there were lots of social functions associated with the university on the students behalf that I don't see now, but that may be because I'm a retired faculty member.

138
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But every Friday, I think it was, they had on the campus when I was a student, something called the Nickel Hops.

139
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And this meant that all the sororities, in particular, I'm not sure about the independence, but all the sororities, cleared away the stuff in the living room, and they had music that played, and men would move from one house to another, and you paid a nickel to enter and dance with the girls that were there, and so you'd go from one place to another.

140
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So that was one way, easy way of getting acquainted with girls.

141
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The other important social affairs, or series of social affairs in the campus who are a bunch of formal dances, there was something called the sophomore cotidian, the junior prom, the senior ball, and then something called the military ball that was put on by the oral to secret.

142
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And these were formal dances. The women wore long dresses, and the men wore, on some occasions, even tuxedos.

143
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But no less than a dark suit at any rate, these ties everywhere.

144
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And they were events planned pretty much long in advance. So you got yourself what was called a dance card, and you went around to your friends, and the fraternity, you exchanged dances.

145
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You came with your girlfriend, of course, but you exchanged dances. You didn't dance with her the whole evening.

146
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So you generally saved the last dance, and the first dancer yourself, and a couple in between, and then you would be trading off with friends.

147
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't know what happens these days, but I look back on that with a good deal of illness. That was lots of fun.

148
00:21:44,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The campus was highly regulated in the sense that, well, the putt and blunt terms, it seems to me that the university regarded itself and was looked at as a de facto parent in the absence of a family, you see.

149
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So there were real restrictions, particularly on the women. If I remember this correctly, closing hours in all women's groups, there were very few married students, very few on the campus.

150
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I only knew one, one couple in chemistry. So the students generally lived in living groups. A few of them had apartments, but not very many.

151
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And so these living groups, the women's living groups, had strict closing hours. The women had to be in by 9.30 on a school night.

152
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That meant they were going to the library. They were out of their living group at 7 o'clock in the library, and of course they could meet boyfriends and so on there.

153
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Or you could arrange with your girlfriend to meet her at one of the Monroe Street places that served coax. You'd have a coax or something like that.

154
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But they had to be in by 9.30. And if they weren't, if they were late, they could be penalized by having their...

155
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, I'm forgotten. The penalties varied quite a lot, but they could be campused, which meant that they had to stay in their living group. They weren't allowed to do certain things that they otherwise would have been allowed to do.

156
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The men had no restrictions at all. In my house there was a real strong million forced study hours from 7 to 9. The house was supposed to be very quiet, and it was.

157
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So, academia flourished at those times that a study did. The other thing I didn't comment on, there was no alcohol available anywhere, not in town.

158
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I think there was something like a two-mile rule. There would be no retail outlet for alcohol within two miles of the campus.

159
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And that prevailed until rather late in the history of the institution.

160
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What you see along on road street now is a lot of places where you can get beer and other things, and the students are clearly enjoying their Fridays like today at the Brew Station, for example.

161
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But on those days you couldn't get it. In fact, Oregon... I forgot what the date of the overturn of prohibition was, but alcohol was slow to come to Oregon in the sense that, first of all, you could only buy it in the green front. You couldn't buy it in a restaurant, but you could bring your bottle in a restaurant.

162
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And they would charge you a corkage fee and serve you. But a long time for that to be overturned.

163
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So there's one incident that I can tell you about that I've mentioned it before, but it was really quite remarkable. I think it was in the winter of 1941.

164
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think it was before Pearl Harbor when we had a tremendous ice storm. I don't know whether you've heard about this ice storm, but what happened was,

165
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:18,000
we had a freezing rain, and this was on the night of one of the old school dances, which were held by the way in the Memorial Union Ballroom.

166
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The size of the institution when I first, in the fall, maximum size was... I remember 4,200 students. So the end-of-the-year ballroom could generally contain all the people that wanted to go to a formal dance.

167
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:49,000
A lot of people couldn't afford going, so they didn't. Well, anyway, in the end view, on this particular occasion, there was an ice storm that began early in the evening, and people began to show up.

168
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And as the evening drew on, the rain, which had continued, began to develop into a freezing rain.

169
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And the trees began to be branches, began covered with ice. All the power lines were covered with ice.

170
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And as the dance went on, all of a sudden, maybe 8,39 o'clock, the lights went out.

171
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And what had happened, of course, is that the power lines were down because of the weight of the ice and so on.

172
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, this is an all-school dance, and it was dark. You see, no lights in the end view ballroom.

173
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So, somebody scrummed up the candles and put them around the edge or some other form of light.

174
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But the end view lounge, which is very much the same as it is now, is a place where in these dances, couples would repair to rest a while and sit, smooch with each other.

175
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And when the lights went out, you could imagine the glee that that was greeted with.

176
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, then after a show, I happened to be up in the lounge at the time with my girlfriend at the time.

177
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And the lights went out. And due course, there came one of the shaperones, usually a wife of a faculty member.

178
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
She came in with a large candle lobby, with lighted candles, and she put it on a big table in the middle of the room.

179
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And then she turned around and she walked, and she walked back to the stairway down into the ballroom.

180
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:48,000
She got to the head of the stairs and disappeared. One of the students there got up, walked over to the candle, and all the candles out to her great chairs.

181
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In a few minutes, the same woman came back, and she lit the candles again.

182
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And she turned her on and walked away, but she didn't get to the head of the stairs this time before the student, maybe the same one, went up and blew them out again, again to great chairs.

183
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This time, she never returned.

184
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It turned out the lights were out as a consequence of that storm for the best part of a week.

185
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And that was devastating, well, devastating. It was extremely hard for my mother because we cooked on an electric stove.

186
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And we had all these students there, four of them, plus my sister and myself.

187
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So she prepared the meals as best she could using pots and pans and so on in the fireplace.

188
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We had a fireplace, fortunately, and she could build a fire and do that. So essentially we camped for a week.

189
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We remarkable experience. Well, as far as the campus was concerned, the consequences of that ice storm were devastating.

190
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The campus in front of the MU at the time was covered in a large number of trees, beautiful trees.

191
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Perhaps many of them, Elm trees, I don't know.

192
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The ice storm actually broke the branches off of these trees to the point where it looked like a tornado and hit that section of the campus.

193
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You could walk through it in a daytime. It was still freezing. You could still see the ice.

194
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Branches lying everywhere on their trees, effectively denuded of their branches.

195
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Well, I led to the removal of most of the trees in front of the Memorial Union.

196
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I suppose it was true if some other places on the campus also. I don't remember that, but I certainly remember the MU before and after.

197
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The MU was a remarkable thing.

198
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's more or less the way social life was said, well, football, of course.

199
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh, there were a couple of other things. Football was mostly for the students and a lot of them went.

200
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But you weren't allowed to come with a girlfriend.

201
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The men and women sat apart.

202
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,000
If you walked in with a girlfriend, there would be a raucous cheer from the men's section and they would shout the word fusser, which was a...

203
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And that term was a sort of epithet.

204
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There used to be a directory called the fusser's guide here.

205
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That was for people to look up the addresses and phone numbers and other students.

206
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And there were some of the townspeople went too, but the stadium would only hold a couple of thousand, I think.

207
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
There were only three thousand people, just one grandstand along one side.

208
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Maybe some install bleachers. I don't remember that.

209
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But there were also organized on the campus four times a year. It may have been six, but certainly four.

210
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What we're called, Lysia, Lysium in the singular.

211
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And these were events that comprised visiting artists of one kind or another, who often music.

212
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I have heard Hartter Rubenstein play the piano here for Oregon State at one of these.

213
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I've heard Paul Robeson sing.

214
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And a number of other people, like the really famous artists, would come.

215
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And that was paid for, I don't know how, but how the university resources because your student card admitted you to these.

216
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And they were held in the old men's gymnasium, if I remember this correctly.

217
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And with a small student body, you always had enough space.

218
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I was going to, I lost the throttle when I was thinking about these Lysia, but they were looked forward to.

219
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And a lot of people in the Oregon State students who are largely rural students, agriculture was the biggest college on the campus or school it was called.

220
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And I guess this is regarded as an opportunity to expose them at least to a kind of a cultural side of life.

221
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
They were quite remarkable events. And I was enthralled.

222
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I didn't, there's no history of music in my family, but I thought these were marvelous events.

223
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So that was essentially in a way the campus was set up.

224
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The old, I was going to say the basketball games were also played in the men's gym.

225
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And the basketball schedule was different then what it is now.

226
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We have those called the Northern Division and the Southern Division and the Champions of these two would meet for the Champion Coast Championship.

227
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's the athletic side of the things there.

228
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So what else can I tell you about the times?

229
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, I'm interested also in what your academic friends was as an undergraduate.

230
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh, well, after Southern Oregon Normal School, it was quite a change.

231
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Now, the normal schools were coaches, you know, were teachers' colleges.

232
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And so there was no major in science at all. And I just had elementary chemistry by taught by a well-meaning lady that really didn't know very much.

233
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
A couple of years later, one of my friends told me that his brother was there in the same class as I was.

234
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
This brother told my friend that I knew more of the chemistry than the teacher did.

235
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't know whether that's true or not, but at any rate, that gives you kind of a level of instruction there.

236
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, when I came to OSU, that was a different matter entirely.

237
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And the first thing I took care was a course in analytical chemistry.

238
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And I was dismayed at my first grade in an exam in that course because by my Southern Oregon Normal standards, it was a very difficult exam.

239
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And I didn't do very well on that. I think I got a C or something like that, but I wasn't used to that.

240
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So I learned what I had to do to work hard. And I ended up with a B in that first term for which I was very grateful.

241
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And generally speaking, I did very well here after that initial shock.

242
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And there was a lot of interaction between faculty and students because the classes were much smaller.

243
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It was a good experience.

244
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And I enjoyed it a lot. Of course, the war broke out.

245
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So I say, I spent a year here. Since I was in science, I was deferred until I graduated.

246
00:37:46,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And the campus was pervaded by a sense of what was going to be happening to almost everybody, the men on the campus.

247
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So a lot of the students chose paths that would take them into the military, offices, training, that sort of thing.

248
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
ROTC was required at that point.

249
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm sorry, I have to cough. I have this just allergy that comes this time of the year.

250
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That just about finishes my recollection of my undergraduate days here. Well, as I say, I played tennis.

251
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And we played Oregon, Washington State, Washington, Idaho. And to get to these places, we traveled by car.

252
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And usually that was the car of our tennis coach. It was a guy named Bill McCallop, who also played football here.

253
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And what's on the faculty is a football coach of some category or another.

254
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So we drove. Yet the Idaho, we drive a car, you see. And then of course, we'd arranged to play Washington State at the same time.

255
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So that was a long trip in and by present standards, a kind of uncomfortable car. But we were young and it was lots of fun.

256
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Were all of your chemistry classes in Gilbert Hall or did you ever have classes in the Kimsack?

257
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:16,000
All the chemistry classes at that time were in Gilbert Hall. There was a building down on Jefferson.

258
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And then what was now 15th Street? That used to be called the Kimsack.

259
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Lennon's Pauling, of course, met his wife in the Kimsack. And I've often walked him around the campus.

260
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And one time when we were walking down there, he wanted to go into the building and we went up. And we went onto the floor and he went into one of the rooms there.

261
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I can't remember whether the configuration was different from what he remembered, of course.

262
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But he was able with reasonable certainty to identify the room in which he was teaching when he met Eva Helen.

263
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And he gave me a couple of amusing incidents about the Kimsack in those days.

264
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What did he say?

265
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Pardon?

266
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What did he say about the Kimsack?

267
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Well, there was one famous incident. And you see, we didn't, I guess he didn't have natural gas as we did later on as when I was there.

268
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And so when you had a burner in the laboratory, this was generally burning gas, perhaps so subtly.

269
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And I think it was in a steel tank. And that was mixed with oxygen and other Jason's tank.

270
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And these were admitted into the laboratory by Hoses.

271
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And there was a guy there, an assistant of some kind, and Pauling told me his name, but it was a foreign name, an Indian name, or something like that.

272
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:30,000
A student who was working there and being paid to do certain things. And he managed to get these lines connected up in the wrong order.

273
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:44,000
In such a way that when he turned on the tap, the higher pressure in the oxygen tank forced its way through the tube into the acetylene tank outside.

274
00:42:44,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, the consequence of this ultimately, for reasons that I run explain, was an enormous explosion and fire that destroyed the stock room in much of the section of what was called the Kimsack.

275
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And Pauling said he never knew what happened to this student he wasn't hurt. Nobody was hurt, it turns out.

276
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But Pauling didn't know whether he had managed to get his degree or not. That much he was able to tell me about.

277
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
When I read the Kimsack, I had a reputation for catching on fire.

278
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Did what? I had a reputation for catching on fire.

279
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Did it? I don't know. Well, this was certainly one.

280
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And you can see why. I thought it was the method of firing up burners.

281
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The chemistry nowadays is done in much more batches usually in the undergraduate lab than it was then.

282
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I mean, if you made a preparation then, you made a pound of it, I'm exaggerating, but I mean, you had a lot of stuff there.

283
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Nowadays, it's all green chemistry, very small amounts of things.

284
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And the summertime, I worked once on the... I don't remember whether I worked two summers or just one summer in another vacation period.

285
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
On the campus is a part of the surveying crew.

286
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And one of the guys who stayed with us and my mother's uprooted rooming house was a guy who was a civil engineer and had a standing summer job.

287
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And he ran this line of levels. And so he taught me how to hold across things and so on.

288
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
He taught me what the signals were and so on.

289
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And that was better than working in the hot orchards in Southern Oregon, but I didn't earn a lot more money out of it. I can say that.

290
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That was your stock room, dumb.

291
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Oh, this is a stock room job. You signed up. There were a number that was all student-operated.

292
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, there was a head of the stock room. A man named Stoney Wells. I remember that still.

293
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
One of the reasons I remember it because I mentioned that name to my father. And he said, Stoney Wells, I know him.

294
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So I brought him around one time and they shook hands and reminisced for a while. I don't remember what the connection was.

295
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But the students were the ones that actually did the legwork and taking in glassware, handing it out.

296
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And those days you checked it out. You had a pad and you filled out what it was you wanted.

297
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And handed that to a guy behind a window just like at a shouts someplace.

298
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And he would go get the items and give them to you. And then there was a return sheet.

299
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And when he returned it, the items had to be clean and dry. You put them back, looked at the sheet, made sure everything was there.

300
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Put them back and then matched it up with the checkout sheet and threw the tool away.

301
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So things were borrowed and returned from the stock room. And we who did this work behind the window were what we were being paid for by NRA, NYA.

302
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
National Youth Administration.

303
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The first year I got 25 cents an hour and the second year I got a raise to 30 cents an hour.

304
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But that was big money in those days.

305
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You could buy a Coca-Cola for a nickel.

306
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And you could go to a movie or something like 25 cents.

307
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And a full plate lunch would cost you 35 or 40 cents. Something like that.

308
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I remember my childhood in Hokeyam. My father and my mother was away.

309
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And my father and I went out to a local rooming house called the Finnish boarding house in Hokeyam.

310
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And they would serve meals to people who came in. It was family style, a big long table.

311
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
A bunch of silent guys sitting there and spooning it in.

312
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And the cost of that for the two of us was something, for each of us something like 20 cents a piece.

313
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's just a bag of tell by today's standards.

314
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Unbelievable.

315
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Were there any classes or teachers that made a big impact on you in the undergrad?

316
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Oh yes, there were.

317
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
JP Meilig was a very long-term faculty member here.

318
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
He was an analytical chemist.

319
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,000
The first man that I really met on the faculty because that's the first course I had to enroll in here.

320
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
He lived to be over 100 years old.

321
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And he was a man of incredible precision in everything he did.

322
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:50,000
His analytical chemist seems to fit his personality because he did everything by the clock and by rules.

323
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
People used to say, JP Meilig always walked to work and he lived down on eight streets or something like that.

324
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And he would walk up Jefferson to the chem shack.

325
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And I was told, I don't think the story is apocryphal, but maybe the...

326
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I mean, people used to stand and wait for Meilig to walk through the gates.

327
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And they said, you could almost literally such a watch by his coming in.

328
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well, I had a little...

329
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
He got his degree at Purdue.

330
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And he never ceased to be very interested in what Purdue was doing.

331
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And he subscribed all his life to the student daily newspaper of Purdue.

332
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
He used to go back there for the summers to do research.

333
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And he drove his car.

334
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And every year he changed. He bought two new tires, either for the front or the back and older than at the years.

335
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And those days, tires didn't land nearly as long.

336
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And then the war came along. He couldn't get tires. And he was terribly upset.

337
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It turned his life around in an uncomfortable way because he was so used to buying these tires.

338
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
There was another man later made a great impression on me.

339
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And that was a man named James W. Ferguson. He was an organic chemist.

340
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And as a war broke out, of course, he left and he went back and worked for the Midwest for Eli Lilly Company.

341
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:50,000
But anyway, I learned an enormous amount of organic chemistry from him. He didn't do a lot of research.

342
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But he was certainly a superb teacher from my point of view.

343
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Another person, of course, was Bert Christensen, who became department chairman after I returned to the faculty.

344
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:21,000
He was remarkable in a way because as a faculty member, because it was very hard to do research here at the time.

345
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Federal grants didn't exist then. The kind of structure we have now, like National Sun's Foundation, didn't exist.

346
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So you had to do everything more or less on your own and you got very little contribution if any from the state.

347
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But he managed to involve himself in research, both with graduate students and undergraduates.

348
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And I worked for him for a year or so.

349
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And a very interesting project that we finally published.

350
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And that was my first publication with Bert Christensen.

351
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
There was another guy named Bill Caldwell. I never had as a teacher.

352
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But he was a very popular instructor of freshman chemistry.

353
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
He had very fancy demonstrations that the kids liked a lot.

354
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And then of course, there was EC Gilbert, who was a physical chemist.

355
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I grew to know all these people as a student.

356
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Of course, when I came back in the faculty, all the ones I mentioned except Ferguson were still here.

357
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Ferguson, after he went back to Eli Lilly, he returned to Oregon and he went to Portland State where he finished his career there.

358
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And after I came back on the faculty here, I saw him a few times in Portland.

359
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
He looked just the same.

360
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So those, of course, I knew other faculty members too, but I didn't have them in any of the coursework that I took.

361
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So that's a project that you did with Bert Christensen, that was your first experience of science in the research?

362
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Well, it was called, are you asking what kind of work it was?

363
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yes, and that was your first research project.

364
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Well, it was called a micro-determination of hydroxyl group.

365
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And it was an analytical technique where you work with very small amounts of sample using microbalances, seal them up, and then a reaction took place.

366
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And then we could analyze the mixture and we could determine one aspect of the composition of the molecule.

367
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Later on, when I worked at Shell Development Company, I learned that our analytical method was being used in that commercial analytical lab.

368
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So that was really pleasing to me. They were big time down there.

369
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So by the time you were done with it, at OSU, did you decide that you wanted to be an academic?

370
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
No. The war was on then.

371
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And I was faced with a decision about what I was going to do.

372
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And I had two opportunities.

373
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The war work was going on in the chemical industry.

374
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And in particular, there were people from Shell Development Company who came around and they were looking for people recommended by the faculty to do war work on some of their projects.

375
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
The other opportunity, and I was interviewed by them on offer to the job.

376
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The other opportunity was to go into the air force in a program that would have been, for me, in meteorology or on armaments, not in flying because at the time my visual acuity wasn't very good.

377
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So I had been registered with a draft board.

378
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And I went to see Gilbert. He was a nice guy. I liked him a lot.

379
00:55:47,000 --> 00:56:07,000
But he kind of grumbled. He would talk in a little voice. He said, I think it's ridiculous for you to go into the air force and not use your chemical training when you could do that in war work where they need skilled people.

380
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So then I went down to my draft board and I talked to the chairman of a draft board.

381
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And I think his name was Cindy McCollum or something like that. And at that he was clearly a scot. And he ran a gas station downtown.

382
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And I explained the situation to him.

383
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
He said, young man, you better go in the air force or we're going to draft you.

384
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Well, this caused me to think a little bit about this.

385
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And at that point I knew I wanted to go to graduate school, you see.

386
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:02,000
To make a long story short, I finally decided that I would take the job at Shell Development Company, which was professionally extraordinarily valuable experience.

387
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But in terms of emotional contentment, it certainly wasn't very relaxing.

388
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Most of all I spent most of the war on 1A, which is the draft status, eligible for the draft.

389
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And you never know whether you're going to be drafted.

390
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And well, I guess I shouldn't have said it that way. When you're in 1A you're eligible to be drafted and will be drafted.

391
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So I was always classified 1A by the draft board.

392
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:56,000
The company appealed to the appeal board in Oregon on grounds that I was doing war work and supplied the paper verification of this.

393
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And because of the secretive and important nature of this war work, I was always reclassified in the deferred status of 2B.

394
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Now, this deferred status lasted for only 6 months, dated from the time that you were first classified 1A.

395
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Well, it took about 3 months for this process to go on and for you to be reclassified 2B. But by that time you only had 3 months left.

396
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So I spent literally half of the entire war years in 1A while the process of keeping me deferred to do this war work went on.

397
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And it's more than just paperwork because before you're classified 1A, you get a notice on the draft board that says greetings.

398
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And then you have to appear for a physical. So they would tell you, first of all, I had to appear at 5th of Monroe for a physical.

399
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I said, I can't do that. I'm in war, gauging war work down here.

400
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Real transfer your physical down there. All this took time, you see.

401
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So then I would take the physical or I would go down. I'd be transported to San Francisco up to the procedure.

402
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And there are a whole bunch of potential draftees were lined up and we went through a physical that took at least, well it took all morning and the most of the afternoon.

403
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
At which time?

404
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You either classified as physically capable or classified for aft which means incapable of military service.

405
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So at the end of this I was classified 1A. My draft board was notified and they told me I was 1A. Then the company would get the papers and they would appeal this and we would go through the whole thing again.

406
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I did that about five times I think during the war. And on one occasion just before the war was ending both in the Pacific, both in the Europe theater, was in 1945 and I had an emergency up in Dectomy.

407
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I was in the hospital in Oakland for over a week, bed ridden. They didn't allow you to get up or anything. I had a huge scar like this.

408
01:00:48,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So anyway in the middle of all this my nose to appear for a physical. But I knew that if you had a recent serious operation and that was serious in those days, you're automatically deferred for six months.

409
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So I tried to tell them that I had a recent epidemic that says take your physical. So I lined up down in Oakland and we knew of course we were transported across the bay with a hundred other guys you see.

410
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I told a strip there and I said to the corpsman and the first corpsman I said I've had a recent epidemic in Dectomy and I said I'm supposed to be deferred for six years as getting mine.

411
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I got in line. I came to the next corpsman I said the same thing to him. He said getting mine. I went through all the tests and saw them pass them all and came to the last guy who was in office there and there's a guy who's supposed to test with your men.

412
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:59,000
He said he was supposed to test with your mentally fit. He says likeologist and he'd look me up and down and said you had a recent epidemic in Dectomy and I said yes I've been trying to tell him that all day long. He grabs my papers and he writes deferred.

413
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Lastly the war ended. There was still going to be occupation forces and the war ended of course in the Pacific in August of 1945.

414
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:35,000
A lot of the military were being decommissioned and sent home and so on. Then the year were rolled around and the question was who are they going to have in the occupation forces.

415
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:43,000
At this point of course there was no further need of my services in this war work and so I was eligible for this.

416
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But on the 2nd of February in 1946 I turned 26 and they didn't take anybody over 25.

417
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So then I was automatically out of the occupation draft group and then I entered Keltek in the spring of that year left Schilddevelopment company.

418
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
What was the right to do with yourself?

419
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Oh well there were several things. The Japanese of course had succeeded in overrunning all of the plantations that provided latex for natural rubber which was of course really needed during the war.

420
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So synthetic rubber had been discovered and there were all sorts of ways of making synthetic rubber. So I worked a lot on the problem of synthetic rubber.

421
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Another thing that developed about this time during the war was the discovery of the efficacy of penicillin which is being produced in a traditional way.

422
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:16,000
In our area by cutter laboratories it existed in either in Emoryville or in Berkeley or Oakland right down there close to the bay.

423
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:27,000
They had huge vats and they cultivated this and separated the penicillin which was distributed the arm forces was not available to civilians at all at this time.

424
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And I worked on the extraction the methods for extracting penicillin from this.

425
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:45,000
The third thing that I did was and that was probably the most interesting in many ways was a aviation gasoline inhibitor.

426
01:04:45,000 --> 01:05:03,000
No aviation gasoline at that time was 100 octane fuel because all the aircraft were propeller driven and there was a high performance engines that were required that level of anna quality.

427
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:17,000
This was particularly during the North African campaign and these tanks of 100 octane fuel were shipped across and then they had to stand on the desert.

428
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Now one thing that happens to gasoline is that over time they tend to form some gum which settles out to the bottom.

429
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Now that gum if it gets into the engines of course can be a very serious matter.

430
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So they apply what are called inhibitors to delay or greatly slow down the formation of this gum.

431
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And the stockpiles of fuel there in North Africa had in them a dye, a red dye.

432
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It turned out that when the gum was formed this red dye would be occluded and take down the fuel would change color.

433
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So the sergeants running the dump would realize what was going on and they would then use this deteriorated fuel and jeeps and in motor vehicles of various kinds.

434
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well of course it's obvious that what you want to do is to prevent this from happening as long as possible because that's expensive fuel to be using in jeeps.

435
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Then it turns out that a lot of the time that the stuff was gone the dye was disappearing the fuel was still good.

436
01:06:42,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well we had a special inhibitor that was better than anything in use that we were developing and testing in the desert with a drum that we had mounted on the Mojave Desert at an army base with a bunch of thermocouples all through it

437
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:14,000
because we needed to figure out how quickly the gum formed in accordance with weather conditions.

438
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I mean if you store these drums I mentioned in North Africa in the winter there's no problem it's cold and in the summer it goes to pot very quickly.

439
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Well how do you know that because you don't know what the temperature inside the fuel is because in the summer a barrel at the bottom might be relatively cool and one at the top would be totally gone.

440
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Well we had a way we put these thermocouples all through this test drum and then we could measure the rate of formation of gum as a function of well we took these temperature data from the thermocouples all through the drum

441
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and worked that up into something that we could call an effective temperature for the whole drum and we could predict from a thermocouple in any place what the effective temperature was in the whole drum.

442
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And that would tell us how long that fuel could be expected to last and so we did that in addition to developing and testing our inhibitor which turned out to be very good.

443
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Well the war ended before the inhibitor could actually be used and then of course the fuel now is not under octane anymore so that never got into production but if the war had gone on much longer it would have been.

444
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:45,000
So that's the kind of thing that I did and all of this laboratory work was a tremendous aid to me when I entered graduate school because I know how to use my hands.

445
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I've been doing it for three years in the laboratory.

446
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
This job was in Southern California.

447
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah it's a Keltaq.

448
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh was that Keltaq?

449
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I went to Keltaq.

450
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But the shell job?

451
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh the shell was it was an emery bill.

452
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:10,000
It was called shell development and emery bill was a small enclave between Berkeley and Oakland on the bay.

453
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
So were it about an hour and ten minutes do you want to keep going or do you want?

454
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I can go longer I probably should leave here about quarter to twelve if you want.

455
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We can do whatever you like.

456
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
If you're if you're feeling empty but definitely like to keep going.

457
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So you finished up at shell and then you went to Keltaq.

458
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
What was the process by which that happened? How did you mind if you'd come back?

459
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well the laboratory I worked in at shell.

460
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I should say just a little bit more about that.

461
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It was a small laboratory.

462
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
A shell development there were all sorts of projects distributed all over.

463
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
There was a motor lab out and back in which gasoline were tested.

464
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I was in the research end and there were the head of my small laboratory and another guy who had been working there for a long time.

465
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And I was brought in as a third guy to help these people.

466
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:34,000
We became all three of us very close friends in a social as well as in a professional sense.

467
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:44,000
The man who headed is named Daniel B. Luton Jr.

468
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
He was a remarkable person.

469
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
He was a very good scientist.

470
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And at the same time when the war was over, during the war he got very interested partly because of this North African stuff in climate.

471
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And thereby associated himself with geography.

472
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So he knew a great deal about geography all over the world and especially about climate changes and temperature and so on.

473
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And he used to amuse us by coming up with some facts that you didn't know.

474
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:38,000
He said, where do you think the rainiest July in the world is?

475
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Where is the place where the rainiest July takes place?

476
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well right away you think monsoon or something.

477
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It turns out there is some village called Chara Pungi India in India.

478
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And he said in the monsoon season he announced to us that it had something like 240 inches of rain in the month of July.

479
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
These are the kind of facts that he would come up with.

480
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Well the reason I mention all this is that after the war was over he retired from Shell as a chemist but became so knowledgeable in this other area that he was appointed an adjunct professor of geography.

481
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And as time went on he built quite a reputation in that field.

482
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
He came to Oregon State, gave lectures here, was invited up on the geography department.

483
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
He was a very very interesting guy.

484
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The other fellow was just as interesting.

485
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
His name was Aldo de Benedictus and he was an Italian obviously.

486
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
He came from an Italian family who was engaged.

487
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
They had a business in making pasta.

488
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And one time he told me he says, don't let him kid you.

489
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
He says the dough is all the same.

490
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's just the die that makes the difference between pasta.

491
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So the texture is different depending on the die but not the dough.

492
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Well many graduated from Cal.

493
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:21,000
He was an excellent student but he had a family of several children and he had to go to work.

494
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But not having a doctor's degree he was not running the lab you see but Dan Luton treated him in every way as an equal.

495
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
He had his own projects and everything.

496
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Well he spoke Italian fluently and Shell had occasion to

497
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:50,000
want somebody that knew Italian very well to serve as a translator and so on.

498
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And after the war he moved out of chemistry into marketing for Shell where his language skills could be useful and he moved to New York.

499
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Well he did very well in the company. He moved up the ranks.

500
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Finally when he retired officially from that aspect of Shell they moved back to Berkeley, he and his wife and family.

501
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I guess his kids were grown and they lived there at the time.

502
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And then he told me he became very wealthy after he retired.

503
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And he told me how this happened.

504
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:47,000
There is a company knowing as...

505
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I'm thinking advanced micro devices. It's not that one. It's another one that makes chips.

506
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's the biggest chip maker in the world now. Chips for computers and so on.

507
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:08,000
No, no. No they make...well I'm sorry I'm a spoke.

508
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I think they make the devices for making chips.

509
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But he told me, Benny told me, we called him Benny, that he was approached by some people about this project.

510
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And he said about five or six of them sat down around the kitchen table in his house in Berkeley.

511
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And he decided he would...they all put up $10,000.

512
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And that company just grew like wildfire and he ended a multi-millionaire just by investing that money.

513
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And so he endowed a chair at Berkeley in chemistry called the Aldo de Benedictus Chair of Chemistry.

514
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
His wife went to UCLA and was a nutritionist.

515
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And he set up a similar thing in her name at UCLA with another million dollars.

516
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
This was done years ago. It must be worth a lot more than that now.

517
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So I thought that was quite a remarkable story for a guy who spent his youth making pasta and working in a chemistry laboratory to end up like that.

518
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Okay, so Caltech, what decided me to go there?

519
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Well I was thinking about going there and I wrote the EC Gilbert and he said, well you asked, you know there's a very good university right there where you're working.

520
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:50,000
That's University of California. For some reason I wasn't interested in going to Cal. I don't know why.

521
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But it's a tremendous institution of course and great people there.

522
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But maybe I had enough of that area for the while.

523
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And so I applied to Harvard and to Caltech.

524
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And in due course I was admitted to both of these as a student and then I had to make a decision.

525
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And so I talked to Dan Luton about all of this and he said, well I said,

526
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Caltech has got Linus Pauling. Who else do they have on the staff?

527
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And I knew a lot of people at Harvard, you know, very famous people. But the only one I knew at Caltech was Linus Pauling.

528
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And Luton with his customary brusquen sense of humor manner, he says, look, he says with Linus Pauling they don't need anybody else.

529
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
That was his famous line to me and I've never forgotten that well. That wasn't enough to decide me.

530
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:03,000
But what did decide me was that it was only a short distance away.

531
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It was on the west coast in a place which at that time was reputed to be beautiful as indeed it was all right.

532
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And I had a small beat up car that I knew wouldn't make it across the United States.

533
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And so I packed this thing up with my duds, my wife and myself and we started out for Caltech.

534
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And I'll tell you this too, this is more a personal history than it is a professional history. I guess maybe that's all right.

535
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Well, this was a 1933 Chevrolet Coupe.

536
01:18:48,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And it had been repaired once and I started out. We hadn't loaded my wife and myself. And we started up a steep hill out in the valley just before you get into Southern California.

537
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And the car began to falter and it wouldn't go anymore.

538
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,000
But then if I stopped it, fired up the engine, it would catch and I could go a short distance and go, it would stop.

539
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Just as if it were tired, you see.

540
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So then I turned the thing around and managed to get over in the other lane. It wasn't a freeway on those days.

541
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
And I went down at the bottom of the hill. The car ran just fine.

542
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Pulled it up into a gas station which was closed for the evening.

543
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And it had a mechanic associated with it.

544
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And so I pulled into this gas station. There was a light on in the house and back and I asked about mechanic. I came to the door and said, well, I'm a mechanic.

545
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I said, well, I hate to bother you. I guess you're closed. This is, yeah.

546
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
This is what's your problem. I explained this to him.

547
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And he put down his knife and fork. You're literally having dinner and he went out and he listened to this and looked.

548
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
He says, you need to know a few of them.

549
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
He says, I don't have one here, but I think I know where I can get one.

550
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And so I said, gee, that's very kind of you. And he said, no, no, that's okay. And he gets in his car and he goes away in 10 or 15 minutes.

551
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
He appears and he's got the fuel pump.

552
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And then he gets to work on my car. It puts a new fuel pump in on those days. It was a fairly simple job.

553
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
He said, I've got to give you a new fuel pump in. We fired it up and he says, there, that ought to do it.

554
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And I said, how much do I owe you? He says, well, he says, you pay me for the fuel pump.

555
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And I said, I got to give you more than that. He says, nah, nah. He says, sometimes you just have to help a guy out.

556
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:02,000
That is a lesson. You know, that happened when I was 26 years old. I had never forgotten that.

557
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And to my last angry grad, I never learned the guy's name or the location of this, but I had never forgotten that.

558
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Absolutely remarkable. You know, he spent a lot of time and he wanted nothing for his time.

559
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So I didn't know that you were married at this point.

560
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Yeah. But that was my first wife. We divorced some years later.

561
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:37,000
My second wife was, I met a Norway and we've been married for 55, 56 years or something.

562
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Anyway, they get back to Caltech. So, I know where the hill got down, found a place by then wife at a relative there who offered to put us up for the night to not her husband was a postman in Pasadena.

563
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And he on his rounds happened, knew quite a bit about vacancies and so on, which were very, very few.

564
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And in that time, in that area, there were a lot of houses that had garden colleges and back of them. And he knew about one of these.

565
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And I went up to my wife and I went up, interview these people.

566
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:32,000
There were old people, 80 years older so nobody was in the house and they had fixed it all up.

567
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:42,000
They were very particular about their tenants. And after I guess we turned on the charm, but they agreed finally to rent it to us.

568
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:50,000
We were then able to wheel up our fuel longings and put them in the house, which was furnished.

569
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And we lived there for quite a long time.

570
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:13,000
When I went to Caltech, I presented myself at the main office and I said, I'm on appointment Mrs. Wolf, Beatrice Wolf, who's his secretary.

571
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:23,000
She said, well, Dr. Pauling likes to talk to all the new graduate students, I'll set up an appointment for you. And she did.

572
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I can't remember whether I got an office right away or not. But at any rate, I do remember the interview with Pauling.

573
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:46,000
He knew that I was from Oregon and from Oregon State. And of course, there was a kind of a bomb there because he had gone to them.

574
01:23:46,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Not a bomb, but at least there was something in common. And so he asked me when I was interested in it. And I told him I was interested in chemical kinetics and mechanisms and so on.

575
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And he said, well, he said, it's too bad because the right person for you to work with would have been Roscoe Dickinson.

576
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And he died last year of cancer and we haven't anyone to take his place yet.

577
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But he said, we do have a young postdoctoral fellow here from Mac East.

578
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And he's interested in this kind of work and doing a project. And it would be fine for you to work with him if you would like to. And he would like to have you.

579
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And this day, my mind is boggled at that because you can't imagine our department chairman here suggesting that any of the incoming graduates students work with a postdoc and not with a faculty member.

580
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,000
His hands are very hard to come by and your research program.

581
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So I went to see this man, his name was C. Gardner Swain, who later went on to a distinguished career at MIT as an organic chemist.

582
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And I worked a full year for him until his period was over. And we did a project, a project of his that turned out just fine.

583
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And we published a paper on it together.

584
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
What was the drug?

585
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It was a oxidation of a local malachite green to malachite green carbonyl, was an organic compound, which then decomposed or, yes, to form a dye called malachite green.

586
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,000
We could study the reaction by watching the color formation of this stuff.

587
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So it was a fine project. And it was good for me because I was good for Gardner because I had had all this laboratory experience during the war.

588
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Probably had more than he had at that time in the actual laboratory work.

589
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But he was a very clever guy. And if we wanted to do a reaction at Shell Development Company, we had all the equipment on the shelf there.

590
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I could bring down what was called a thermostat, a constant temperature bath.

591
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I could put up the control mechanism and put in the controlling thermometer and the heaters and so on.

592
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I had to have it all set up in 15 or 20 minutes.

593
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
At Caltech, they didn't have any such thing.

594
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So Gardner sat down. He was good at electronics and he drew out some components that we would need.

595
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And I went up to the avenue to an electronic store and bought these things.

596
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Came back and spent, you know, how long?

597
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:09,000
A couple of weeks or three, maybe even more than that, taking courses. Building is relay that would work.

598
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Building and putting it together, soldering wires and so on.

599
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then I spent another week locating and getting transported a big tank, which I could fill with water that would hold our samples.

600
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I set up the heater and put everything in it and got it going. It took me the best part of six months versus that 20 minutes I mentioned to you.

601
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Once it was set up, reactions, experiments went rather nicely and conveniently fast.

602
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
That got done in Gardner's year there.

603
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
That was a good experience. So at the end of that time, I had to decide I was looking ahead.

604
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
What else I was going to do?

605
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:08,000
And there was a young guy there. He was only about six years older than I was that had a very, very good scientist.

606
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
He'd done his work with Pauling and the Nannah to the faculty.

607
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And he had a group of young people that were kind of eager and I went to talk to him.

608
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And the upside of that conversation, so I decided to work with him and we had a project that we settled on right there.

609
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So Gardner left. I began to work with this man whose name was Werner Schumacher.

610
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So maybe we should talk about some of this at a later time.

611
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So I can do that.

612
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:55,000
What I can do is send you an email.

613
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Why don't you send me an email and suggest some times because I think I can fit more easily than you.

614
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Now next week I'm going to be in Ashland going Tuesday and won't be back to the weekend.

615
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Is that okay? The week following that we can do.

616
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Let's see.

617
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
We're looking into October now, Chris.

618
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
No, we're not.

619
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:43,000
After the Ashland week I'm free every day except Thursday when the president is hosting the Emeritus faculty at a luncheon.

620
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday are all available.

621
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Okay. And the next week is entirely free.

622
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That's the week beginning the 26th.

623
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Okay.

624
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Okay.
