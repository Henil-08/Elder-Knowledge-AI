1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Okay, so we are recording now and it was like last time, real briefly, just state

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,759
your name and date date.

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,359
Yeah, my name is Kenneth Hadberg and what else you want?

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,359
Date, date.

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,359
Date, date?

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,359
Date, date?

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,359
Yeah.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,160
Oh, and this is September 20, 2011.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,480
So we last thought last time you had just made this switch over to the energy maker and

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,480
you were studying your research with him.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,480
I wanted to think about how that happened how you met your maker and started out on

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
that subject.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,039
This is that Caltech.

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,880
I can't remember whether I mentioned it, I spent a year working with Gardeners Wayne.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,880
I think I did that.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Yeah.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,200
Well, at the end of that time, I interviewed a boarder-shamaker who might pass them them all

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,359
several times and he had a group of people.

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
He was young, not far from my age.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,320
So I went to see him.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
We hit it off.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,879
Well, and I decided I would do my future work with him.

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:21,079
And I began almost immediately and we decided we would look at a number of boron compounds

24
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,799
that we were able to...

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,319
We didn't make them ourselves.

26
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,079
We got them from a guy at USC who's...

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,000
Name, I can't remember now, distinguished in organic chemicals today, right?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,039
And we began with Diborane, which we measured and were able to show conclusively that it was

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,120
a non-ethane-like structure.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:01,880
It had two hydrogens up above and below the boron-boron bond and the well-known bridge structure.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:13,640
After that, we took up a number of other boron compounds, including B4H10, B5H9, B5H11,

32
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:24,759
and some substituted Diborane with chlorine and bromine atoms on them and also amino groups,

33
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:31,759
amino Diborane, we studied all of these to place in the next few years.

34
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,799
I think some of them overlapped.

35
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:41,079
I was still working when some of them after I got my degree when I continued.

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,160
So that was an exciting time.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,600
And excuse me.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:02,480
I finished my degree in June of 1948 and I was offered a postdoctoral position.

39
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,280
Oh, that came about in an interesting way.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:18,159
Pauline came around one time in spring of 1947.

41
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,959
That was only, or maybe it was a fall of 1947.

42
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,120
I'd only been there for at most 18 months and he said,

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,439
I think you should write up your work for a degree.

44
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:42,400
And I said, well, I was hoping I would be able to take another year and work that year

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:52,120
with Professor Badger, who is a distinguished spectroscopist.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Pauline said to me, well, he says, you write up your thesis and get a degree and I'll

47
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:05,159
see that you get a fellowship so you can spend an extra year working with Dick Badger.

48
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,439
And then he said, you know, you'll make a lot more money after you get your degree than

49
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,239
you would before you get your degree.

50
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,239
So why not?

51
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,800
Your studying doesn't stop at the time you get your degree.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:25,439
So the logic of this was impeccable and I said about writing up my work for my thesis.

53
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:35,800
And I'm sorry about this thought I had the same problem last time.

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,199
So I finished writing up my thesis.

55
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,040
Now the troublesome aspect of this is that my supervisor, Werder Schumacher, was off

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,240
on the Guggenheim Fellowship in Denmark.

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,960
And so the person that nominally oversaw my research was Robert Cory.

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,360
Robert Cory, of course, he and Pauline published a series of seven papers that ultimately led

59
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:14,560
to Pauline's winning in Nobel Prize for his Alpha Helix and other things as well.

60
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,879
Anyway, Bob Cory didn't know anything about electron diffraction, but he was a very nice

61
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,199
friendly man and he helped me over some crucial points.

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,639
So I said, I'm having a lot of trouble writing this thesis, getting it all right.

63
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,480
He says, well, he says, tell me what it is you're struggling with.

64
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,839
And so I told him, he said, well, why don't you write it down?

65
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,759
So I wrote down what I had been telling him and then edited a little bit and I don't

66
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,920
get me over home.

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,079
Anyway, I finally finished my thesis and took my examination.

68
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:05,360
Pauline was not present in Werder, was not present either, having it still being in Denmark.

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,719
So, excuse me.

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,780
Before I got my degree, I continued to work for a while on the projects that I had been

71
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,800
working until Werder returned to Denmark.

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,480
And then I was sure enough, I've got my degree polling returned and I received notice that

73
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,220
I had been awarded an A-Noise Fellowship which enabled me to spend a year working with

74
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,440
Richard Badger.

75
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,920
Which I did and I learned some spectroscopy in that year.

76
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,560
But on the side I continued my work in electron diffraction as well.

77
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
Well, that was a very nice year.

78
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:08,220
At the end of my fellowship year, I was appointed a research fellow at Caltech and I worked

79
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,740
on a grant that Werder Schumacher had with the Office of Neville Research.

80
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,020
At that time, the Office of Neville Research was sponsoring basic research.

81
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,700
I didn't have to have much to do with the Navy as far as I could make up.

82
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,700
So I worked on that for a couple of years.

83
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:43,740
And then in 1951, I think it was polling said to me, oh, maybe I should go back a step.

84
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,860
During this year, a number of people showed up at Caltech from abroad, mostly post-doctoral

85
00:07:50,860 --> 00:08:00,620
people who were anxious to work either with polling or some other dignitary and Werder

86
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,579
Schumacher, Werder Schumacher.

87
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,860
And I became quite friendly with a number of these people, including a guy from Norway

88
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,699
named Ulte Bustjonsen.

89
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:18,819
I'm getting just a little ahead of the story there.

90
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:25,100
Because I decided after I'd had a couple of years that I should have a post-doctoral fellowship

91
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,220
maybe abroad or something like that.

92
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,580
So I decided that I would continue my work in spectroscopy.

93
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:41,980
And so I filled out an application for a full-bright fellowship to Belgium.

94
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,980
There was a man there with whom I wanted to work.

95
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,500
And so I filled this thing out, sent it all off, and got back a notice and do course a

96
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,980
few months later, saying unfortunately.

97
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:03,180
My application had been received too late to be considered in that year's batch of

98
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,100
full-bright fellows, but they urged me to apply again for the following year.

99
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:17,220
Well in the following year, my friend Ulte Bustjonsen, later friend Ulte Bustjonsen, showed

100
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,580
up from Norway, and he was a specialist in Electro-Nepraxion.

101
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:28,379
And I had known him not personally, but through publications.

102
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,180
And we hit it off.

103
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:39,379
We became very friendly with my wife and myself and him and his wife, and he had two small

104
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,180
daughters.

105
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,060
And so we worked together at Caltech for a while.

106
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:52,500
And then, as your daughter of close, he said, why don't you apply again for a full-bright

107
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,379
and apply this time to go to Norway instead of to Belgium?

108
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,339
I said, well, that sounds to me like it might be worthwhile.

109
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,099
Maybe I'll do that.

110
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:10,899
About the same time Pauline walked into my office one day and said to me, I think you

111
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,019
should apply for a Guggenheim fellowship.

112
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,139
This is how he didn't say, would you like to?

113
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:21,299
He said, I think you should do this.

114
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:27,179
Well Pauline carried such an oral with him that when he made a suggestion, you almost

115
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:35,019
always followed through and decided that was a prestigious fellowship.

116
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,860
And so I thought, gulped and said, okay, I'll do that.

117
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:48,220
So I wrote out an application form, which was essentially the same proposal for research

118
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,779
that I had written to the full-bright program.

119
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,259
And I sent this off.

120
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:01,019
And I waited around a while, working away with Werner, not knowing what was going to happen.

121
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,500
The meantime, Bustjansson went back to Norway.

122
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,500
And in due course, I got a letter from the full-bright people saying that I had been awarded

123
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,659
a full-bright research fellowship to go to Norway.

124
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:26,019
And this paid all my living expenses and paid my transportation back and forth.

125
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:31,419
And then about that same time, maybe a little later, Pauline walked into my office and said

126
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,219
to me, well, are you getting ready to go to Norway?

127
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:43,740
And he didn't know anything about my having received the full-bright fellowship.

128
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,620
And I said, well, I didn't know I was going.

129
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,179
And I think I may have the chronology inverted here a little bit.

130
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,459
I think maybe he came in before I received notice of the full-bright fellowship.

131
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,419
That makes a little more sense in what he's back.

132
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,659
I said, I didn't know I was going.

133
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:08,979
He said, well, the selection committee generally follows my recommendations and he turned and walked out.

134
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:13,459
That's all, that was a total conversation we had on the issue.

135
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:21,139
And a bit later, I got a letter from the good and high people saying I had been awarded a good and high fellowship to go to Norway.

136
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,939
And it was $3,500.

137
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:26,419
Well, now, and then the full-bright notice occurred.

138
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:37,139
And then I had gone from where I had no support, where I had two rather well-endowed fellowships for the same period.

139
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,339
So I thought, well, you know, I have to let them know.

140
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,899
So I rolled off to the good and high people, said I'd also been awarded a full-bright fellowship research fellowship.

141
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:54,219
They said the good and high money was given to me, irrespective of whatever other awards or monies I had.

142
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:55,980
Well, I felt pretty good about that.

143
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,300
So well, of course, I set the same letter to the full-bright people.

144
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:13,220
And they wrote back after a while and said, we normally subtract money from additional grants from the full-bright grant.

145
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:25,259
But that, the amount of money that you have from the other source should be enough to support you for the full period of your time before we will take any action on this.

146
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:41,019
And they said, we have determined that the $3,500, this is in 1942, that went a long way then, that $3,500 is not enough to support you in Norway for a full 12 months.

147
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,980
So we will not subtract it from the amount that we give you for the full-bright grant.

148
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:55,420
So the full-bright grant was the equivalent of a little more money than that, actually.

149
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,019
I can't remember what it was in Kroner.

150
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:07,659
I think it was 4,200 Kroner a month, and there were seven Kroner to the dollar then.

151
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,899
So that was about $600 a month.

152
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:17,340
That might have been $75,000, and over 10,000 bucks in those days were big bucks.

153
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:32,539
Well, at this time, my first wife decided that she met somebody she preferred to me, and so she let me, and I had all this money, that was going to go to Norway with as a single person.

154
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:56,459
So I booked passage on Mauritania, and I traveled across the country, visited a couple of laboratories, I went to Oak Ridge and visited some friends there, went on to New York, sent my luggage on ahead, and due course, I embarked on the Mauritania, which took me to Southampton.

155
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:06,139
And I spent a few days in England, and then I set sail again on another ship to Norway.

156
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:13,180
And when I arrived there, this was an origin ship liner.

157
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:20,220
I was met at the pier by my friend, Ultima Steeleinson, and a number of other people that I had met there.

158
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:32,779
I didn't mention that I had been to Norway once before, after I had met Boss Johnson, I went to an international meeting in Stockholm.

159
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:38,660
And on the way back, I stopped, so I'll buy and shout out to him a little bit about what we were going to do.

160
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,899
We had a big party.

161
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,940
That was a fine party.

162
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,180
I can still remember it.

163
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:55,659
I don't know whether I should go into the details there, but anyway, that was a great party.

164
00:15:55,659 --> 00:16:07,259
So he and his friends and collaborators in the laboratory met me at the boat, and they had been looking for a place for me to live.

165
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:17,179
This was Norway in 1950, the October of 1952, first of October.

166
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:25,740
And it was after the war, and Norway hadn't really begun to recover very much then.

167
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,860
So they told me that they had found an apartment, and they were ashamed to say it was terribly expensive.

168
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:40,460
But they thought it would suit me pretty well because it was very close to shopping.

169
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,580
I had a...

170
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,779
Oh, let me call it a district anyway, called Mayush to it.

171
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:56,300
And I had a fine apartment there, and it was owned by an English woman who had been separated or divorced from her husband.

172
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:57,779
She had gotten this apartment.

173
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:04,379
She was going back to England where she came from originally and was going to rent it out for a year.

174
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:13,980
So, and it cost my friends to tell me that some of the much over price was 150 crore a month.

175
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,619
That's $20.

176
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,419
Now, 150 crore remember, my first check was 4,200 crore.

177
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,180
And that paid my rent for the entire month.

178
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,180
And...

179
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,980
So anyway, I moved into this place, which was furnished.

180
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:42,300
It had a kind of a couch or a bed, but it was perfectly satisfactory and had a kitchen, a bath and all of that.

181
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,620
Kind of a studio arrangement.

182
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,740
Within walking, the easy walking distance of the university up on the hill.

183
00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:01,220
So, I lived there and I had determined before I left that I was going to learn the language.

184
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:11,220
And my friends, Bustjonsson, had been talking to the cultural attaché at the embassy and to the people in charge of the full-by program.

185
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,700
And they had managed to find me a set of records called, and those that are no longer existent, I think,

186
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,380
they had an extended call, a lingua-phone records.

187
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,259
And they got me, they were 78s.

188
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,900
And they got me an old record player.

189
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,779
A friend had one of those and so I could play these records on them, they could hear the sound.

190
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,299
Along with these records came a book.

191
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,740
And this book had a picture on it.

192
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,620
And it had the text that was spoken.

193
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,340
So, the idea was that you put the record on.

194
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:49,579
The lesson, of course, was almost obvious.

195
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:53,740
The words were ones that you could transliterate from English.

196
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,539
So, very slowly the words were spoken on this page.

197
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:05,579
And you could see the picture of what it was describing on the facing page.

198
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:15,699
And so, I would look at this and the spoken word would come to you.

199
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:16,899
And then there would be a pause.

200
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:23,939
And you were supposed to repeat after this, mimicking the accent, the tonality as closely

201
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,779
as you could.

202
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:32,939
And so, this, I later came to admire these records very much because at the same time you

203
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,859
saw the written language.

204
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,979
You heard it spoken and you had to speak it.

205
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:44,539
And there was no translation except in the picture.

206
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,859
And believe it or not, this happened in 52.

207
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:54,459
I can still recite lesson 123 almost by heart because after you had gone through this thing,

208
00:19:54,459 --> 00:20:00,259
there was another section where they were asked, you were asked the question relating to

209
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,259
this.

210
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,980
And you had to respond to that.

211
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,259
You see, it was quite remarkable.

212
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:13,819
And an example of this, the first sentence was describing the picture, it was,

213
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:18,180
Deette Art Familia Hansen.

214
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:24,299
Now, you can almost say what that, Norwegian is a language which has almost the same word

215
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,579
order as English.

216
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,859
Deette Art means this is.

217
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:35,460
And this is the family Hansen in this picture.

218
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,220
And then they say, best of all, sit there, in, in a stool.

219
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,779
Grandfather is sitting in a walking chair.

220
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,339
And you could see that if you know, at the bottom it says best of all, it says, Grandfather

221
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,220
is here, look in a picture and there's an old man, you know, the beard.

222
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,059
And he's sitting, sit there, you know, that right away, in, in, in, in a stool, you

223
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,339
know where they learn that stool is chair and then it means rocker.

224
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,299
Anyway, that's just an example.

225
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:11,579
And I went through, every day I came back from the university, I would sit down, I would

226
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,940
study, it's amazing.

227
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,500
These things only played for three minutes if you played them through.

228
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,579
It took me an hour and an hour and a half to get through a single lesson doing everything

229
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,699
they wanted me to do.

230
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:30,099
And in the morning I would go up to the university and I would, my friends saw, you know, they knew

231
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:38,819
I was doing this and I could recite the whole lesson to them which caused proxisms of laughter.

232
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:44,139
One of my friends said the guy, there were several voices, as the lessons went on.

233
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:51,259
The first was a man who had a, he was an Norwegian but he was a rector of the university

234
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:52,539
at that time.

235
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:58,700
And my friends swore they could hear his voice speaking when I spoke to them, I mean mimic

236
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,099
this accent.

237
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:09,700
Well anyhow, when I first went up to the laboratory to meet Paul Stjohnson in a work environment

238
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,819
and we talk, we knew what we were going to do.

239
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:21,339
He introduced me to his laboratory assistant, whose name was Lisa Snavić.

240
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,700
And he said, she's only been working with the three months but I think you two should

241
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,259
work together because I am an administrative duties I'm occupied with also.

242
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,659
So we engaged in this project and Lisa and I worked on it together.

243
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:40,939
Well when I was introduced to her I was ever so impressed because of course I was introduced

244
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,460
in English on the first day or two and she spoke to me in English and we had a conversation

245
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,900
and I later asked, well have you spent any time and what did you learn in your English?

246
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,740
She said, well I learned it in school, I said, haven't you been to England or the states?

247
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,220
Oh no, no, she says, I've never been in an English speaking country.

248
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,779
It impressed me so much and this is true all these people, you know.

249
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:10,220
You walk in, they've never been out of that country they can talk to you in your language.

250
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,539
I'm sure those can do that here, it's almost impossible.

251
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:24,100
Anyway we worked together for two or three days and then I, very interested in music

252
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:32,819
and the also Philharmonic played downtown and I got on the tram one time when I was on

253
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:33,819
the town.

254
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:45,220
Oh I think, oh in the first few days I was there I decided I needed to have my own car.

255
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,980
There were very few cars and also at that time.

256
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,059
My use to it today is one of the busiest places in town.

257
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:54,619
I mean it's bumper to bumper getting through there.

258
00:23:54,619 --> 00:24:00,419
When I lived there it was rarely a car and they were all pre-war things.

259
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:09,620
The country was so destitute of so devoid of money that cars were very, very hard to

260
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,620
come by.

261
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,500
But anyway I could buy a car, there were agencies there but I had to pay for it and for

262
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,220
it and see and I had to agree to sell it.

263
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:29,019
I mean I had to agree to export the car.

264
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,420
It had a special license plate on it in the case.

265
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,819
It had a Q number on it which means owned by a foreigner and means you didn't buy tax.

266
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:43,619
So the upside of all this was that if I sold the car in the country at the end tax would

267
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:45,619
have to be paid on it at that stage.

268
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,119
Anyway I bought this car.

269
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:58,019
So I drove the downtown to go to the symphony here a few weeks later and as I walked in

270
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:03,579
there stood Lisa picking up her ticket as I was picking up mine so we sat together,

271
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:11,220
enjoyed the symphony and afterward I asked her if she'd like to have a after concert snack.

272
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,259
And so we went to a restaurant of famous place called Blooms that is still there and we

273
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:24,420
had a big cheese spread and had a good time together and we again date regularly.

274
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:36,820
And the upshot of all that was that after my year there I went back to the States and

275
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,500
there was Lisa and I were thinking of getting married and I wasn't quite ready to commit

276
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,620
because I hadn't quite recovered from my first marriage.

277
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,900
But at any rate I got back to the States and then I proposed to her and I came back to

278
00:25:51,900 --> 00:26:02,340
the following summer which is 54 and we were married in Oslo and that say 54 I guess

279
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,100
we've now been married 57 years.

280
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:13,180
Anyhow that was a romantic outcome and I got I've often speculated about this later

281
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:21,180
as suppose that full bright application that I had applied for to Holland to Belgium had

282
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,019
been successful.

283
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:27,660
My life would have been quite different from what it is now.

284
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,980
Such things, fate turns on.

285
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,620
Were there any colleges that you're family?

286
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,220
How do you mean marrying a fair foreigner?

287
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,579
Her mother had died a couple of years before I arrived.

288
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:48,100
She had a sister and a father.

289
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:57,299
A father worked in a bank, a personal manager of a bank and she had an aunt, sister of her

290
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:04,980
mother that lived upstairs in the apartment building.

291
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:12,380
My wife's family is going back to generations as a distinguished one.

292
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:27,539
They came from Denmark and my wife's great-great-grandfather was the foreign minister of Denmark.

293
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:34,539
He and one of his siblings founded the New York Times of Denmark.

294
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:42,019
It's called Poulotique and so the family had an interest in that newspaper.

295
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:52,779
One of the other brothers was a distinguished newspaper, my name is Critique.

296
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:56,180
The name is well-known.

297
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,339
It's called Brandes.

298
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:02,379
Edvard Brandes, you can find books written about the Brandes family in Denmark.

299
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:09,899
Well, that was her great-great-grandfather and great-great-great uncle.

300
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:18,339
So anyway, Alicia's mother's stand from this group has did her aunt upstairs who became

301
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:25,339
kind of a surrogate mother to her after her own mother died.

302
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:30,259
So, we came back.

303
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:31,939
Alicia's father.

304
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:34,539
I enjoyed him a lot.

305
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,259
He was very taciturn.

306
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:41,539
Some Norwegians don't say very much but I think he was pleased that I could speak to him

307
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:42,539
in his language.

308
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,339
He didn't know.

309
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:50,940
He could speak a few words in some words of English but he wasn't as comfortable in it.

310
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,940
So we hit it off very well.

311
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:03,779
And Alicia's aunt too, she was a patrician, tight person.

312
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:09,539
She had beautiful furniture and paintings and so on.

313
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,980
Her husband was a distinguished Norwegian scholar and so on.

314
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,059
Very wealthy.

315
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:27,220
And this family, Lisa's aunt, uncle and her cousin to whom she is still very close.

316
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,299
We see them quite often.

317
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:32,139
They have a lot of fancy stuff.

318
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:39,099
They have paintings by Toulouse with track and they have monk originals.

319
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:45,099
They have a lot of gold, watercolors and lithographs and so on in their house.

320
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:53,579
That's just something on the wall and I would put an impress by all that.

321
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:56,579
So after we were married, I...

322
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,579
What, like, you know, did you have it in the evening?

323
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,579
No.

324
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:04,579
We married in the city hall in Norway.

325
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,779
You haven't been in Norway, have you?

326
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:17,899
Well, they have an absolutely beautiful city hall and it's got marvelous paintings around

327
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:27,379
that huge murals on the wall that depict the development and evolution of the Norwegian nation.

328
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:35,099
And outside they have some carved, huge carved wooden figures from Northeastern mythology.

329
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,859
The wooden is there on his eight-legged horse with two ravens ahead, all in wood you

330
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,619
can see up there.

331
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:44,059
So no, we were married.

332
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:49,939
They said a reinstall license before I arrived and we were married in this office.

333
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:55,819
It was a civil wedding.

334
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:04,179
I'm not sure, but I think as far as I know, a lot of the Norwegian weddings are done in

335
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,980
that fashion, at least, of the generation that Lisa stems from.

336
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:19,580
So after we were married, we fussed around a while because we had to get a visa for her.

337
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:27,420
And that's a story which irritates me still.

338
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,420
So we applied for a visa, I had done at the embassy.

339
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,080
The embassy is very worried that there are foreigners that want to marry American citizens

340
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,019
simply to get into the country.

341
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,500
Then you have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops.

342
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,700
And time went on, one week turned into two, turned into three, and so on.

343
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,460
And no word, no word at all.

344
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,060
And so I finally wrote to a friend of mine that I met at Caltech and then was working

345
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,139
with him and he was working in Washington.

346
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:05,059
And I explained the situation to him.

347
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:11,059
And he pulled some strings and discovered that the application was sitting on the desk someplace

348
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:17,059
in a pile of papers and they were working through and they would get to it.

349
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:25,379
So I virtually blew my top at this because here I am sitting in Oslo and not getting paid

350
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:33,060
because I'm not working, waiting for some secretary to clear my application for a visa.

351
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:41,700
So I wrote to my congressman in Pasadena and he wrote back on other dismissal, dismissive

352
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,700
letters saying we have to make absolutely certain that these marriages are not marriages

353
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,100
of convenience.

354
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:52,699
And you can imagine how I felt about it.

355
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:55,699
He was a conservative Republican.

356
00:32:55,699 --> 00:33:01,899
I probably turned me into a Democrat forever, but anyhow.

357
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:05,819
Eventually we got to the visa.

358
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:12,579
We got on the plane, flew to Washington, spent a night there and went on to Pasadena.

359
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:18,139
And my wife was very tired at this time and discouraged.

360
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:25,779
And when Norway had beautiful atmospheric conditions, you could breathe deeply and the sky

361
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,500
was clear.

362
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,740
And we landed in a heavy smog time in LA and she later says she felt like getting right

363
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,980
back on the next plane and going home without experience.

364
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:49,579
So we stayed there and I went back to work at Caltech as a senior research fellow now

365
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:56,940
and continued until I learned about the job I'd already been stayed.

366
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Now shall I go on to that?

367
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,940
Well I have more questions about Caltech.

368
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,940
I'll take a little bit more in this.

369
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:15,940
So it sounds to me like the first thing you have is that trust be was what she made

370
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
it accurate?

371
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
No, it was Dick Badger.

372
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,139
I did an electron the fraction with Schumaker, which is a different technique.

373
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,940
Some people call it electron spectroscopy, but it is not.

374
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm sorry.

375
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,940
Can it be bundled under the heading of crystallography or is that a separate discipline?

376
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,780
It's a separate discipline, but it's similar to the crystallography in the sense that you

377
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
measure a diffraction pattern.

378
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,460
The diffraction patterns are very, very different because I'm looking at molecules in the

379
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:54,579
gas and x-ray diffraction looks at molecules and it is in a crystal or at least in a condensed

380
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:55,579
phase.

381
00:34:55,579 --> 00:35:00,579
So how would you classify your discipline in the field?

382
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,340
Well, how do you mean classify it?

383
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,579
It's a technique for studying the sizes and shapes of individual molecules.

384
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:15,579
So would you call yourself a physical chemistry with infrastructural chemistry?

385
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:19,579
So I guess I'm wondering at what point did you decide this is something you want to pursue

386
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:20,579
at the beginning?

387
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:32,579
Well, when I was a Caltech, as I say, I started doing organic reaction mechanisms for a year.

388
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,579
Then I did electron diffraction.

389
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:45,579
And in the course of this, I did some crystal structure with two other people.

390
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:52,579
Then I did spectroscopy with Dick Badger, so I had four different experiences there.

391
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:58,699
Now, this is a little unusual because at this institution, it's rare that a student works

392
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:03,259
for more than one person in the course of getting his or her degree.

393
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:07,219
Usually you pick a supervisor and you work on his projects and what up with thesis and

394
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:09,259
you're out of here.

395
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:18,260
When I worked in end-mythesis, the Badger worked, of course, I was a post-cultural fellow at that time.

396
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:24,260
But in the course of getting my degree, I did three things and all of these things were

397
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,060
written up in my thesis in different sections.

398
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:35,060
That's a little unusual, probably a little unusual for Caltech too, in that people often do

399
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,059
two different things.

400
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:44,059
But three with three different people is quite different.

401
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:46,059
I don't know whether I mentioned that.

402
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:49,059
The crystal structure was very interesting.

403
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:57,059
It had to do with a compound called Arsino benzene, which has a formula,

404
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:05,059
which I can describe verbally as two benzene rings and two arsenic atoms.

405
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:11,059
It was generally thought that the benzene rings are hooked to the arsenic atoms and two arsenic

406
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:17,059
atoms are joined together by a double bond, as we say in the language.

407
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:25,059
But it was pretty well understood at that time that arsenic doesn't like to form double bonds very readily.

408
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:31,059
And particularly with a compound like this, where there's no opportunity, for example,

409
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:34,059
of no oxygen, so round to form double bonds.

410
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:42,059
So it was widely thought to be a dimer, the one I described, just two units hooked together.

411
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:48,059
But we suspected that wasn't true, and so when we looked at it, we found that there actually was a six-member

412
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:57,059
ring of arsenic atoms with these benzene rings flopping off, one off of each arsenic atom.

413
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:03,059
So it was a hexamer, really, and a very nice molecule.

414
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:12,059
The interesting thing about this is, many years later, I got a photocopy,

415
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:16,059
and a large photocopy, which I still have.

416
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:22,059
This is before Euro became the official currency of Europe.

417
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:27,059
I have a 200-mark German banknote.

418
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,059
Now 200 marks is a big bucks in those days.

419
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:39,059
And on it is a picture, a man who is responsible for discovering first arsenic holes in use

420
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,059
for treating syphilis in particular.

421
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:50,059
Well, one of the arsenic holes used was, I gather, was arsenic menacing,

422
00:38:50,059 --> 00:39:02,059
because on this banknote, our paper is actually cited with the three authors and the date,

423
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:08,059
which happens to be wrong, but at any rate, it's on the face of the banknote.

424
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:12,059
I thought that was lots of fun.

425
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:19,059
So, anyway, that's what I did at Caltech.

426
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,059
And I called myself a structure chemist.

427
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,059
So the thing that led me into electron diffraction was,

428
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:31,059
I had to realize this was 50 odd years ago now,

429
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:36,059
it was kind of a cutting-edge technology.

430
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:41,059
It was the best way, everything considered,

431
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:49,059
of determining the sizes and shapes and motions of individual molecules

432
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:52,059
that are unaffected by the presence of others.

433
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:57,059
A crystal structure, of course, of molecules that will affect the other.

434
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:05,059
And the other technique that works also on the same phase is microinspectroscopy.

435
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:10,059
But in order for microinspectroscopy to succeed,

436
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:16,059
it has to, molecule has to have a dipole moment, and a lot of them don't.

437
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:19,059
Arsenobenzine, for example, would not have.

438
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,059
So you can't study a lot of things, but we can study anything we can get into the gas phase.

439
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,059
Select on the fraction.

440
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,059
So, I decided I would continue with that work,

441
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,059
because I like what I was doing with Schumacher at Caltech.

442
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:39,059
And that's what got me started.

443
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,059
So you think some Schumacher and Cori are just knowing a little bit more about what they were like,

444
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:48,059
because their personalities were like the foods that they were doing socially?

445
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:57,059
Well, I can tell you, well Schumacher,

446
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:13,059
he was in my way of thinking he was a brilliant scientist, but not aggressive in the sense that he pushed like a lot of people do.

447
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:21,059
You know, in science, it isn't always enough to have talent.

448
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,059
You have to be a salesman as well.

449
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:33,059
And people like Lina's Paul Engel, he is a tremendous salesman, because he had a personality that took in the whole room.

450
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:39,059
So he had a sense of humor in these lectures where very, very heavily attended.

451
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:48,059
People had come from miles around to here, and I've heard him lecture to packed halls in several foreign countries.

452
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:59,059
There are other people who are distinguished also, but have a very tiring personality.

453
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:14,059
And some of these are one noble prizes, but they don't have a public acclaim that a person like Paul Engel's or Ahmed Suleil does from Caltech.

454
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:21,059
And these guys sell themselves, you know, and there are other people too.

455
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:31,059
So Schumacher was a brilliant scientist and a very critical thinker.

456
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:34,059
He was amazing in that respect.

457
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:42,059
He was so highly regarded that Paul Engel used to come down and bounce his ideas off of Schumacher.

458
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,059
He would come into the office, you know, and talk to Schumacher and say,

459
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:51,059
they've earned her what do you think of this, and he would describe something.

460
00:42:51,059 --> 00:43:02,059
And other people, the organic chemists from the third floor of Caltech,

461
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:11,059
names are getting harder for me to come by quickly, would come down, talk to him about various problems they had.

462
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:15,059
And he was like a bulldog. He couldn't let go of a problem.

463
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,059
He would analyze it, turn it around upside down, and if this, that, etc. etc.

464
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:24,059
These people were sitting listening very carefully to him.

465
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,059
So that's a kind of guy I was.

466
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:34,059
He also, we went hiking in the Sierra backpacking together.

467
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:39,059
We became close personal friends, as well as my me being his student.

468
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:44,059
So we did hikes in the high Sierra's on a couple of occasions.

469
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:53,059
I used to go every summer for, anyway, one to two weeks backpacking in the high Sierra.

470
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:55,059
So we would do that.

471
00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:00,059
And he was eager and interested in that.

472
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:08,059
There are a host of interesting events.

473
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:13,059
But you see, I'm not quite sure how much of this I should go into.

474
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:17,059
But let me talk about Cori.

475
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:29,059
Cori was a, he was a very nice man, and he helped me a great deal when Schumacher wasn't there in that last year when I was riding up my thesis.

476
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:36,059
And he was a crystallographer.

477
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:43,059
And I don't remember the details, so I won't try to recite them.

478
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,059
But I've read them.

479
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:58,059
You can get them the archives, Caltech archives, tell all about polling, encountering Cori and inviting him to come to Caltech.

480
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:04,059
So at any rate, he suffered from some kind of a nervous disorder.

481
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:14,059
It was not Parkinson's in that he had some ticks that would cause his whole arm to move a little bit.

482
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:23,059
And when he walked, he walked sometimes with a little bit of motion.

483
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:29,059
I'm not quite sure what it was, but that was not evident in his speech when you talked to him.

484
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:37,059
And when he was sitting down, you didn't see any Parkinson's like motion at all for me.

485
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:42,059
But he would come to see me, and I could see him in a time I wanted.

486
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:49,059
He was responsible for a very large, excuse me, laboratory.

487
00:45:49,059 --> 00:46:04,059
He was headed up by a guy who was making compounds of the sort that polling was interested in that played a role ultimately in his formulation of the Alpha Helix.

488
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:13,059
I don't know much more about him than just that.

489
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:22,059
But to this day, I'm very grateful for what he did for me in the time of Schimmick's absence.

490
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:24,059
Do you know Dan Campbell?

491
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:25,059
Yes.

492
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:29,059
Dan was a very nice guy to me and a very nice wife.

493
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:39,059
I knew Dan Campbell quite well because there was a very free social order at Caltech.

494
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:44,059
All kinds of parties with the students, postdocs and the faculty.

495
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:51,059
You have a student party, you know, and everybody would be invited and Dick Badger would show up with his wife and Dan and his wife would show up.

496
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,059
And others as well.

497
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:59,059
Polling didn't come to these parties as far as I know.

498
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:09,059
I don't remember ever seeing him there, but I do remember a number of them in which people from physics can Dick Feynman showed up in a number of these.

499
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:14,059
I heard Feynman play his bongo drums at these parties.

500
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:18,059
So Campbell was a nice guy.

501
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,059
He had a medical problem which was solved.

502
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:28,059
He had colon cancer and they removed a large tumor from his colon.

503
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:33,059
But I don't think he ever suffered a recurrence of that.

504
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,059
He was what was called an immunochemus.

505
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:42,059
And that was something that Polling was interested in at the time, immunochemistry.

506
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:47,059
So does that answer your question about what I knew about Campbell?

507
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:50,059
Did you ever buy any chance to eat Roger Hayward?

508
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:51,059
Yes.

509
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:52,059
No.

510
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:54,059
But only in passing.

511
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:59,059
Roger Hayward, of course, was illustrating Polling books for him.

512
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:06,059
And he had a number of beautiful figures in various books.

513
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:09,059
But only in passing, I just met him.

514
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:11,059
And he was the talker.

515
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,059
We have Hayward's papers.

516
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,059
We also have the papers of Jack Demitz.

517
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,059
Well, do you?

518
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,059
Yes.

519
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,059
Yeah, I guess you told me that last time.

520
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:21,059
I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about Jack with it.

521
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:24,059
And then the person and also why is he important among scientists?

522
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:25,059
Oh.

523
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:31,059
Well, I didn't talk about Jack before.

524
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:32,059
Did I?

525
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,059
No.

526
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:41,059
Jack was a, became a very, I'm just to this day, a very good friend of mine.

527
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:51,059
He showed up after getting his degree at, in Scotland, with Jim Robertson.

528
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:53,059
And he came to Caltech.

529
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:58,059
And in the British system, you know, when you study for a PhD, you do your undergraduate work.

530
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:00,059
You study for a PhD.

531
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:06,059
But my understanding is you don't do much coursework from that point on.

532
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:10,059
So Jack attended lectures at Caltech.

533
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:17,059
You see, on subjects that he had an interest in that he had not been exposed to before.

534
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:21,059
But we worked together a little bit.

535
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:25,059
We published a paper together.

536
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:32,059
And Jack has an absolutely incredible sense of humor.

537
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:35,059
And he could do, I don't know.

538
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:37,059
He's not a pushy guy.

539
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:41,059
It's kind of a laid back, why sense of humor, you know.

540
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,059
But he's not a retiring individual at all.

541
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:45,059
He's a very social guy.

542
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:50,059
He's just not a pushy social guy.

543
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:57,059
So he came to Caltech and he was working on crystallography, on an electron diffraction.

544
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:05,059
And then he was joined by, I won't say he was joined, but another guy came named Leslie Orgel.

545
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:09,059
And Jack and Leslie became very good friends.

546
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:14,059
Leslie, he died recently, but he was a distinguished scientist.

547
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:27,059
He was a theoretical chemist to begin with, but began to turn to molecular biology later on.

548
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:33,059
And went to the Salk Institute and had a distinguished career there.

549
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:47,059
Jack, when Pauline won his Nobel Prize for chemistry in 54, we had a huge big...

550
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:54,059
And then we put together, let's call it a review in the Valdivale sort of thing,

551
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,059
where there are lots of skits and songs.

552
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:06,059
And there was a talented fellow named Ted Herald also from Britain, who could write music and played the piano.

553
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,059
And he composed a lot of stuff.

554
00:51:10,059 --> 00:51:22,059
And among other things that were composed were little acts for a participant who would do a kind of monologue.

555
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:25,059
And Jack was involved in one of these.

556
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:27,059
That's a famous one.

557
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:30,059
The whole thing has been recorded.

558
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:35,059
You probably have a copy of it here. It's called the Road to Stockholm.

559
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:45,059
In there, there's something where one of the individuals sitting in his laboratory looking out the window at the young girls going by,

560
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:49,059
in front of a cold Bunsen, as Jack puts it.

561
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:58,059
If you haven't heard that record, it should be put on tape or a disc because it's on Shalak and homemade,

562
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:02,059
and it tends to deteriorate.

563
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:07,059
So, Jack participated in things like that.

564
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:14,059
Then a young lady came

565
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:20,059
and they began to go together. Her name was Daphne.

566
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:25,059
I don't remember her last name.

567
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:30,059
But at any rate, they became very close and they became engaged to be married.

568
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:35,059
She was a post-doctoral person working in biology.

569
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:42,059
And they had met at one of these social occasions, I guess, and they were together a lot in groups,

570
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:46,059
and they had a lot of big parties all of this work.

571
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:55,059
And then, Jack's period, Daphne went home, and Jack's period at Celtic ended, and he went home.

572
00:52:55,059 --> 00:53:03,059
And then it turned out that she had decided against the marriage and broke the engagement.

573
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:10,059
Well, Jack at this time was working with Dorothy Hodgkin and Oxford.

574
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:16,059
And I was on a trip to Europe for some meeting or another, and I stopped by and visited with Jack.

575
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:21,059
And he told me that it was really a hard thing for him.

576
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:26,059
But it turned out, Daphne never married after that.

577
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:28,059
We're not quite sure.

578
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:39,059
And the reason that they broke up, it's a little obscure, but I can say this, at least as a rumor,

579
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:46,059
she decided that Jack was Jewish, his Jewish, and she was not.

580
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:55,059
And this conflict, religious conflict, apparently, was something she decided she couldn't live with.

581
00:53:55,059 --> 00:54:08,059
At any rate, a year or two later, Jack met another young woman, his present life, his name is Barbara.

582
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:15,059
And he met her in Blackwells at Oxford. She was where she was.

583
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:20,059
I don't know what her background is, but she was working in the store there in Blackwells.

584
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:24,059
And they hit it off immediately. She's a beautiful girl.

585
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:32,059
And they were married, and they have, I think they have two children.

586
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:43,059
So Jack, at the end of this period in Britain, you may have all this unrecorded, but you want me to tell you what I know about it.

587
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:55,059
His future career was Dorothy Hodgkin, of course, had worked in the structure of vitamin B12, and had determined its structure,

588
00:54:55,059 --> 00:55:03,059
and had presented this as a plenary lecture at a meeting from how happened to be there,

589
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:09,059
and she got a standing ovation for this, and she later won the Nobel Prize for her work.

590
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:22,059
Well, this lecture or other work that she had been doing with Arcanic molecules, impressed the people in the organic,

591
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:29,059
I don't know whether it's a college or a school or whatever division, at the Ateha in Zurich,

592
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:40,059
and they asked her to recommend somebody who could be in organic chemistry, who could determine structures, and she recommended Jack.

593
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:50,059
Well, he went there, table lecture, showed what he was doing, and the upshot of all this was, say, hire them as a faculty member.

594
00:55:50,059 --> 00:56:04,059
Well, he's had a distinguished career there. He's just widened his horizons immensely, became a professor,

595
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:14,059
which in the Old German system is about the equivalent of the well-regarded senator in this country, you know.

596
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:29,059
And Spenny's entire career at Zurich is now retired, but I think he still has an office, although I'm not sure what he's doing.

597
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:40,059
Occasionally, I run across him in this country, and I write to him occasionally also.

598
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:53,059
So, he is a reputation grew by leaps and bounds he's of foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences,

599
00:56:53,059 --> 00:57:06,059
and he gave the Baker lectures at Cornell, that's the same lecture series that Pauling gave that resulted in this book, The Nature, the Chemical Pond.

600
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:12,059
So, Jack's had a wonderful career. He's a very, very nice man.

601
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:18,059
Did he, does he have any major discoveries that you've known for, or is this the only thing that you've known for?

602
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:32,059
Well, it's a little hard to tell. Major discoveries in a scientific sense, he has a lot of distinguished, he has a distinguished publication record, not in the mouth,

603
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:43,059
but the sorts of things that he took up and studied thoroughly, basic science, it's very helpful to others.

604
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:51,059
But I don't follow Chris the log, if you're very closely, so I can't tell you much about what he has done.

605
00:57:51,059 --> 00:58:07,059
I do know that he worked very hard on the confirmations of rings of various members in the rings, and there is elements of the rings, five, six, seven, eight, and more rings and so on.

606
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:11,059
He's well known for that.

607
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:34,059
I'd like to talk about Pauling it for a little bit. It doesn't sound like he, it sounds like he was certainly a person who spent time with others, but it often sounds like it's not in sort of a social way.

608
00:58:34,059 --> 00:59:03,059
Yes, well, he wasn't anti-social at all. It's just that the kinds of parties of undescribing that many, but not all, the faculty attended, like, oh, I'm trying to think, for example, you mentioned Dan Campbell and Dick Badger and Werner,

609
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:14,059
and a number of other faculty members, as well as postdocs and graduates, so we all have a big party, you know.

610
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:23,059
Everybody was on a first-name basis. I never called Badger by anything other than his first name, even as a student. That's how he was known.

611
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:42,059
Almost everybody was on a first-name basis except with Pauling. He was always Dr. Pauling. He sort of carried an oral with him, and although he was friendly enough, you know, you didn't, you only came so far.

612
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:59,059
He always called me by my first name. Even on visits around here, I never really called him by his first name with any comfort at all, because he never invited it.

613
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:21,059
Now, I should tell you something. This is kind of going back to my stay in Norway. The person who headed up the laboratory on that first went there as a man named Old Hussle. He later won the Nobel Prize.

614
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:44,059
Hussle was a little bit about Hussle. He was an interesting man, and the Norwegian system then had professorships just like the German system. He was professor of physical chemistry, and there was a professor of organic chemistry, his name was Banner, and a professor of organic chemistry, these three groups.

615
01:00:44,059 --> 01:01:03,059
But Hussle was unique. He was virtually, I don't know if I could call him an outright old vinyl, but he had very light features, very light hair, and he had kind of a nistagmas, and he had trouble reading.

616
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:27,059
He never married, and he had a lot of money that he inherited. He was a very good scientist. During the war, he was very aggressive, and he was imprisoned along with a couple of other people, and they were kept in a camp in Oslo.

617
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:54,059
They were not allowed to teach. The university was closed, but against all regulations in this camp, Hussle organized a series of lectures and studies, so the imprisoned people that actually learned a lot, while they were incarcerated from people who had lecture on topics, you see, they had been put in the camp with them.

618
01:01:54,059 --> 01:02:15,059
So Hussle didn't knuckle under at all to the Germans. Well, in the war ended, and he went back, and resumed his position in Oslo. All the people who had been in the camp with him, he used the familiar form of the dress.

619
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:30,059
At that time in Norway, there were two words for you, which is do and see, or do rather, I'm thinking of German.

620
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:58,059
So he was D with of the old school, he was D with almost everybody that he didn't know, older people, especially they always referred to one of his D and D. Anyway, Hussle, after I had been there for a year and come back,

621
01:02:58,059 --> 01:03:21,059
I would always make a point to go into see Hussle, because he was the professor. In effect, I think, a kind of a lonely man, because he had no family, he had a live in a huskkeeper who served him his meals and did everything around. I had a beautiful house.

622
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:40,059
And one time when I came in, I was always going to see him and we would shake hands, and he would go to the board and show me what he was working on. And then one time, when he was working at the board, and I had said D and so on, he was saying D, he turned to me and he said, this is traditional in Norway.

623
01:03:40,059 --> 01:04:09,059
He said, we have known one another for a long time, I think it is time that we say, do to each other. Now, a younger man could never propose that. It had to be the older man. And of course, I was knowing Hussle was idea, I was quite honored by this, because here I was a foreigner, I was saying, do to him, or people that have been in his laboratory for years, that had not been in the camp right now.

624
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:34,059
And then one thing was still D. And these guys had been around for 20 years, he still said, D, you know. So, but anyway, I guess I probably hit it off with him because, of course, I always spoke Norwegian to him. And he was so pleased that an American would come and learn Norwegian.

625
01:04:34,059 --> 01:04:51,059
Anyhow, he invited Lisa and me to dinner at his house on time. We went back to Norway after we were married. I've been there a couple of times on sabbatical leaves afterward. And one of these cases, he invited us to dinner. We had a magnificent dinner at his house.

626
01:04:51,059 --> 01:05:04,059
It was all catered. He had ordered it in from the catering outfit. I think I say yes, actually. We're running a catering outfit. And we had a very pleasant evening at Hussle's house.

627
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:09,059
So...

628
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:14,059
The people didn't get to that TV level, it's calling very often.

629
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:17,059
Pardon? The people didn't get to the TV level, it's calling very often.

630
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:28,059
Not very often. It's a little hard to tell. I was kind of one way, as I said, you know. He always shook hands and said, how's Lisa doing? And he would ask me about her all sorts of things.

631
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:40,059
He would call me Ken, but I never felt that he relished me calling him Linus. And everybody had that feeling.

632
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:52,059
I know he visited here when Earl Gilbert was chairman and alive, and Gilbert referred to him as Linus. They talked to one another on that basis.

633
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:59,059
But I don't think Gilbert had really met him before. I just don't know.

634
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:03,059
The point is that he had a swing bowl that was playing popular there.

635
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:14,059
Yes. I haven't talked about that. I'll know. Well, here is a couple of incidents surrounding this woman.

636
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:28,059
I was asked by the Paulings with my then first wife to babysit the children while they were off on a trip.

637
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:39,059
The children were Peter, Linda, and Krillin. And they were early, early teens.

638
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:49,059
And Linus had finished and gone off to medical training, was often Linus junior in a white.

639
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:59,059
And so we weren't required to do anything that kids had to go to school, and so on.

640
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:04,059
We were supposed to be there in the evenings, make sure that they were all there, and so on.

641
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:16,059
And so we did that. And they had this swimming pool.

642
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:31,059
Paulings House had two wings that came together like this. And people were fond of saying, I'm not sure whether it's true or not, but the angle between the wings was 109 degrees in 28 minutes,

643
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:36,059
which is, of course, the angle, the tetrahedral bond angle.

644
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:41,059
I don't know whether that story is true or not, but it certainly was very close to it.

645
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:48,059
Well, down in the little below, the houses built slightly up and down below. They had a swimming pool.

646
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:59,059
And the Pauling kids, when their parents were away, were on the habit of going around the chemistry department, inviting everybody up to a big party in this swimming pool.

647
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:08,059
And I remember this happening one time. The pool was full of people and the Paulings showed up.

648
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:20,059
And in a short while, David Hilling came out and said, Linda, your father and I would like to take a swim. Can you get these people out of here?

649
01:08:20,059 --> 01:08:28,059
There was a hush that fell over the group, and we vacated the premises very quickly.

650
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:39,060
One of the occasions when I was babysitting the kids, I heard a splash.

651
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:49,060
This is late at night. It was 11 o'clock, and I'd actually gone to bed, and a bedroom faced downhill.

652
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:56,060
But I couldn't really see this swimming pool clearly. I think I saw some ripples in it. And I heard this splash.

653
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:04,060
And I wondered what the hell that was. But anyway, I didn't bother to go out and check and so on.

654
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:17,060
And the next day, there was no sign of anything to lie. And on the second day, I also heard this splash in the pool.

655
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:24,060
And again, I did nothing about it, but in the morning I got up and I went into the kitchen and made my breakfast.

656
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:29,060
And there was a strange man standing there in the kitchen making breakfast.

657
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:44,060
And this was a guy. Again, the name is hard for me to come by, but a long standing friend of the Paulings and Paulings mentioned by name from the University of Texas.

658
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:50,060
And I guess they'd asked him if he'd like to stay there. Well, pardon me.

659
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:55,060
Yeah, that's right, Jeffress.

660
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:01,060
So we introduced ourselves to each other. It turned out we've been living in this house. Both of us for three days.

661
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,060
And this was the first time our paths had crossed. I usually got up early and sold it by then.

662
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:13,060
And then she went to work and I went to Caltech. And he probably was on vacation, came up later.

663
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:20,060
So we've been living for three days with almost third day that I met this guy in the same house.

664
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:27,060
Lloyd Jeffress, that's right. So that was the swimming pool.

665
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:33,060
What do you recall about the children's personality?

666
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:44,060
They were very, very vivacious. And Lynn also, Krillin, less so he was younger, quite a bit younger.

667
01:10:44,060 --> 01:11:00,060
Well, I don't know how much younger, but at any rate, the two older ones, they were almost unfettered.

668
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:10,060
I mean, they were just in everything in a good, humid way. Very vocal both of them.

669
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:18,060
Many years later, I went to Lisa and I went to Europe.

670
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:26,060
And Peter at that time had gotten the position at the University of London, I guess it was.

671
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:35,060
And I called him and he met us in the sports car. By this time he had been pretty heavily into alcohols and big problems.

672
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:48,060
But at any rate, he was enthralled with my wife, Lisa, you know, and boy, he couldn't, he was sidelining up to her all the time and giving her all compliments.

673
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:59,060
She was laughing at him most of the time. Peter had trouble with, I think he had been divorced once.

674
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:17,060
And I don't remember any details of his life, I only knew at the end that he was totally in confidence and he had joined the Wales and was living in a small house.

675
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:39,060
I got a phone call from him a couple of times and Yale asking me about certain events in his father's life as a fellow named Herman Branson, who had given to him some problems regarding priority and discovery or ideas.

676
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:54,060
And so on, Peter had called me, I knew Herman Branson, for the line or anything about this and I didn't.

677
01:12:54,060 --> 01:13:09,060
Well, Linda, I don't know a great deal about her life, how she went to college, what she did, I know.

678
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:16,060
She met Barclay when Barclay was a student at Caltech, Pauling was very impressed by Barclay.

679
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:34,060
I remember one occasion on a party when I was up there. He was asking Barclay some questions and Barclay was answering them and I guess he was, he decided that he was the guy for his daughter.

680
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:43,060
Again, that's just my reaction about it.

681
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:52,060
But Barclay was a nice guy and of course he lived in Pasadena and after we came to Corralis we didn't see them very much.

682
01:13:52,060 --> 01:14:05,060
Barclay used to make an annual or biannual trip up to his glacier in Alaska, he was doing measurements on glacial flow and so on.

683
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:14,060
And one time they stopped by and they stayed overnight with us at a very pleasant evening and Barclay could play the piano quite well.

684
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:21,060
So he enjoys sitting at our piano and playing it during the evenings.

685
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:43,060
Afterward Linda asked her father for something that she could give to Lisa and me as a token of appreciation and I have a picture of Pauling together with all the famous artists.

686
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:51,060
Pauling was the famous African doctor and Dr. Albers Fightson.

687
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:58,060
And with both of them in the picture.

688
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:06,060
That was sent to me by Linda.

689
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:18,060
Would we reflect back on this period of Caltech?

690
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:37,060
Well, I guess it's probably termed because it was, you know, I was asked to give a lecture, a banquet talk one time at a meeting, a symposium in Texas.

691
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:43,060
And the topic suggested to me was the Golden Age at Caltech. That was a title of the talk.

692
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:50,060
So I dredged through all the archives and found out quite a lot about various people and things.

693
01:15:50,060 --> 01:16:06,060
But the Golden Age was the age of all this marvelous stuff that Pauling was doing in chemistry and people like Feynman and others were doing it.

694
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:30,060
And it was an environment that couldn't be more exciting to a young student because you could almost literally hear a lecture each week by a Nobel Prize winner in some subject or another visitors.

695
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:36,060
I mean, I've heard lectures from people like Farmy who came from Argonne.

696
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:43,060
I've attended lectures by Feynman.

697
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:48,060
Carl Anderson was there. I've heard lectures by him.

698
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:54,060
And I've heard lectures by people in chemistry who came through.

699
01:16:54,060 --> 01:17:22,060
So all this appeared when I was a student. And at the same time we knew there was a very active program, an ex-ray crystallography going on devoted to providing Pauling, quite sure, with the fundamentals of structure that would enable him finally to formulate the Alpha Helix.

700
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:34,060
They published seven papers. One of them is the Alpha Helix. That's the famous one. And there's a pleated sheet and a number of other things that they published at that time.

701
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:40,060
So all of this was going on. And we knew it.

702
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:55,060
And when Pauling finally unveiled his Alpha Helix, remember that was a lecture of some showmanship.

703
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:10,060
And I told you about that. No, well, Celtic built these space-filling models. You have some of them here in the special collection. Of the Alpha Helix, actually, I think.

704
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:25,060
And I think it was that same model, which is about this high. And it's got red, white, and black atoms all distributed through it, representing the various elements.

705
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:50,060
He started to give a lecture on this. And this thing was in the middle of the room, but it was covered with a tall paper bag. So he was going to describe the structure. And as he went on, people's curiosity got, they were getting more and more in the edge of his sheets. And he walked over and he pulled this thing up just a little about that far. And he put it down and says, oh, he said, I forgot to. And then people sort of twittered.

706
01:18:50,060 --> 01:19:04,060
He did that once more, you know, when people laughed. And the third time, he took it off and showed it was everybody applauded. You see, he was a great showman in that respect.

707
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:30,060
I remember, by the way, a lecture he gave in quantum mechanics. I took, of course, in quantum mechanics from him. The room was quite full of students. He walked in one time. He carried a big book, which was the nature.

708
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:51,060
I'm sorry, introduction to quantum mechanics by him and Brian Wilson. And the normal copy is about that thing. But this is about that thing. It turns out that every facing page with blanks, we could write notes in it. And he would lecture from this. He would come in.

709
01:19:51,060 --> 01:20:11,060
One day he walked in and as he got in, there was a, the room was very wide and had blackboards. They were blackboards in those days from one end to the other. He walked in, he put up a piece of chalk. And there were three panels here. He wrote on the upper left end corner, N-O-2.

710
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:32,060
Nitrogen dioxide. Without saying a word, he went across, he began to lecture and he filled up the board over here. And continues lecture, filled up the board over here. And as he got to the bottom, he had reached the point where he says, now you take an N-O-2 molecule and he pointed at whether it already put up the chair.

711
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:53,060
People the whole hour were wondering what was going to happen. But he headed at the precise location where he needed an illustration for what he had been talking about. And they had already written up there. That's the kind of subtle humor that he used to impress the students.

712
01:20:53,060 --> 01:21:12,060
He gave lectures to the undergraduates too. And a lot of the undergraduates were a little bit unhappy with this. The better ones were not. The graduate teaching assistants of which I was one when I first came there were delighted with these lectures because they were what they were looking for.

713
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:41,060
But the students, he wouldn't pick out topics in the book and talk about them, the books booker itself. But he would talk about things associated with them that were involved at the, perhaps at the cutting level of research. And he would talk about this. And that kind of disappointed a lot of the students who wanted more explanation of what they were reading in the textbook.

714
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:48,060
Anyway, as TAs, we all like the lectures very much.

715
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:55,060
Well, is there anything else about the Caltech years that we should talk about?

716
01:21:55,060 --> 01:22:18,060
I don't know. We've talked about a lot of the personalities there. There were a lot of people I haven't mentioned that figured prominently. For example, Jerry Donahue is a distinguished crystallographer.

717
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:46,060
And he happened to be in England in the same laboratory where Watson and Crick were. And he is said to have made a key observation to them about the configuration that played a big role in there eventually.

718
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:59,060
Coming to the right structure for DNA. There were other personalities I haven't mentioned in chemistry.

719
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:12,060
There were all sorts of names that run by, but I don't have anything particular to say about them. I did some work with a guy named Vernon Abaki from Switzerland.

720
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:34,060
He was a very, very impressive man named Edgar Halbunner. You know that name? Edgar came to Caltech also. He was a Jew that left Germany and had gone to Switzerland just ahead of the Nazis.

721
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:47,060
He was a superb scientist. He had a wonderful sense of humor. He taught me and my wife how to make cheese fondue.

722
01:23:47,060 --> 01:24:02,060
And he became very, when back to Switzerland, roasted the ranks became a distinguished professor and went to Balsall. He and Jack Donahue were very close as families.

723
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:11,060
So they had apartments just a couple of doors away from each other. Edgar died a few years ago.

724
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:23,060
I had written to him when I knew that he was ill and I got a very nice letter back from him. A year and a half later I was going to write a game.

725
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:33,060
Then a fellow named Ishin Moser showed up to give a lecture in chemistry. I knew Ishin Moser. I had given a lecture and so I can...

726
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:43,060
Halbunner always spoke very highly of Ishin Moser. So I said, how was Edgar? He said, oh, he died. I was shocked. Absolutely shocked.

727
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:55,060
And so I talked to Jack Donahue about this running letter. So I hadn't heard at all. He apologized objectively for not having let me know.

728
01:24:55,060 --> 01:25:10,060
At the end, Edgar became very discouraged about something. He had lost a leg in an accident. He probably knew all about that.

729
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:23,060
I'll tell you that in a minute. But he came very discouraged and he was in the hospital and finally, according to Jack, it appears as if he just gave up.

730
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:33,060
And he died in the hospital. And in spite of them being very, very close to families, I said, well, how is Ruth doing? That said, to her life.

731
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:45,060
He says, I don't know. He says it's amazing because she retreated into herself and has occupied herself solely with her children and grandchildren.

732
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:57,060
We haven't ever heard a word from her. And he was terribly surprised because they were very close and she was an open, friendly woman with a great sense of humor.

733
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:06,060
And maybe it just struck her so hard that she didn't want to have any connection with the past at all.

734
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:23,060
I wrote her a letter and I never had a response offering my condolences that Edgar was a very athletic guy, particularly in a rowing.

735
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:33,060
He was a single-score guy. He wrote on the lake in Zurich, but he was a budding scientist. And he told me all this.

736
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:53,060
He had been out on the town with his girlfriend and they had come by the house where he lived. It was an apartment up here on this hill when the tram came down like this.

737
01:26:53,060 --> 01:27:02,060
One of these brand new Swiss trams that have all sorts of safety features on it.

738
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:11,060
He was standing waiting for the tram after having run upstairs to see whether the article he had been accepted had been published.

739
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:19,060
He was looking at a journal, you see. It had not been. And he came back down. He was standing on the platform with his then girlfriend.

740
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:28,060
And this tram came down the hill of the high-rated speed out of control and tipped over like this.

741
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:40,060
I don't know whether his companions survived that. And Ruth was not she. I think that's true. I think she was killed.

742
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:50,060
But at any rate, his body went through a window of the tram. But one leg was trapped underneath and they had damn-putated.

743
01:27:50,060 --> 01:28:07,060
So when I met him, he was using a cane in the out of prosthetic device. He didn't use crutches. But he was brilliant at all sorts of alerts in Switzerland for a science later on.

744
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:18,060
It's hard for me to think about these people and knowing them as I did and then thinking about what would have happened to them.

745
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:33,060
Bad. So that's about all I can tell you. You know, there are many, many minor details. But those are the highlights of it all.

746
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:40,060
Okay. Well, we will go ahead and hold it for today.

747
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,060
Okay. You want to do more of this?

748
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,060
Yeah.

749
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,060
Okay.
