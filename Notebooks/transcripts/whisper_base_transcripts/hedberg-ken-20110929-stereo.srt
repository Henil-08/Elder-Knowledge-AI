1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So there's still questions you want to ask me.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are, yes.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Just like last time, go ahead and introduce this off.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The name is Dave.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, yes. My name is Kenneth Hedberg.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the 29th of September of 2011.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So last time we pretty much finished up with Caltech.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But one thing I realized I forgot to ask you about was any memories you have of David Holland from that time, too?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Uh, only peripherally because I saw her together with her husband fairly frequently.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Excuse me.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And she, of course, has always present that they open houses that they held occasionally.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
She's open houses.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There's some of the faculty and so on were invited, not very many of the students.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So I saw her there.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I saw her a lot, of course, later on when she and Linus came to Oregon State.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But at the time that I was at Caltech, I saw her with Linus a great deal.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And that's about all.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When did you make the OSU and what made you decide to make that deal?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When did I come to OSU or what?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, I don't know.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Have I mentioned it all the circumstances under which I experienced the opening here?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The opening.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
At Oregon State?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, no, no.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, well, I had been working at Caltech for many years after my doctorate and, well, many, five or six.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I was actively engaged in research and I was stopped in the hole one day by Carl Neiman, who was a distinguished organic chemist,

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and he knew my new, quite well.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He said, can I receive the letter from a former colleague of mine?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A man I went to graduate school with at Wisconsin, who was now at Oregon State.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And he said they have an opening there.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And he wondered whether I had anybody who would be interested.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or we here at Caltech, if anybody who might be interested.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I just thought I'd mention it to you in passing because I remember you were in Oregon State undergrad.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, at this time, my wife was pretty unhappy in California and in Macedonia because of the air pollution.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Our first son was about to be born and she wanted to raise him in that environment.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, I said, yes, I'd better explore this.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And so, I wrote them to E.C. Gilbert, who wrote back, indeed, they did have an opening.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And one thing followed another and it turned out that my wife and I were going to drive North to Oregon to visit my parents, who lived at that time in that story.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I said to Gilbert that I would stop on route and talk with him and members of the faculty and discuss the opening.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then I got another letter from a guy named Bill Calville, William E. Caldwell, who let me know on certain terms that the reason this was a job was because he had managed to get the president of the University of A.L. Strand to commit to new two new faculty hires and chemistry.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it turns out that at that time, well, let me put it this way.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Earl Gilbert and Bill Caldwell were not on the best of terms. Gilbert was a department chairman and Caldwell was a professor who did no research on site, but had some mining claims and other things.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And it was kind of a more open, free-handed back slapping type, a member of the country club and a new L. Strand fairly well.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And he complained that the freshman at Oregon State and incoming students were not being given proper instruction because there weren't enough professional staff involved in this, just graduate teaching assistants and so on.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And he managed to convince Strand that perhaps there should be some positions set up.

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And these would, people, of course, would be nominally responsible to Calville since he was running the whole program.

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the main purpose of the main task of these people were going to be that they would sort of ride herd on all the teaching assistants.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So they would patrol the laboratories, make sure that the teaching assistants were doing their job.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They would, of course, have some responsibilities themselves, but in the freshman program, they would hold recitations.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And they would be, in this way, and be responsible for laboratories and then, as I mentioned, patrol the laboratories regularly.

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I immediately sensed that there was something, there was a bit of, what an adversarial relationship between Gilbert and Calville.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And Gilbert, of course, was interested in hiring somebody who could also increase the research potential of the faculty.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Calville wasn't the least interested in whether these guys could do any research or not. He just wanted them as sort of major domos.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And so I learned all of this in more detail when I came and talked with Gilbert and talked with Calville.

60
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I also had numerous conversations with other members of the faculty, people who have passed on now, Tom Noros, Wendell Slebaugh, everybody that was on the faculty that I had known before.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And after concluding all these interviews, we drove on down to my terrace, came back to California. I had told Gilbert, it was still a guy who was officially in charge of the hiring, that I would think it over and I let him know.

62
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:55,000
After I got back to Pasadena, I thought for a long time about this and decided that the conditions of this job were such that I found it unlikely I'd be able to get my research program going at Oregon State in a reasonable length of time.

63
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So I declined the offer, which was $5,500 for nine months, not now, nine months, but spritle payments split over 10 months.

64
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, my wife was very unhappy about this because she liked Oregon more like Oslo where she grew up in Norway.

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:32,000
As she put it, there was so water in the rivers of Panoragin and trees in the forest where she couldn't see that in LA.

66
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We drove across a bridge one place and I pointed out that this was the San Gabriel River. She looked down, there was no water, it was just a dry wash.

67
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We went through the San Gabriel forest on the outskirts so that there was nothing but sagebrush, that's the source of her comments.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
At any rate, she was very unhappy about this. And a few days later I got a call from Gilbert saying he was very sorry to receive my letter.

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He had very much hoped that I would accept the job. And he said he wondered if they were able to increase the starting salary a little bit, what I reconsider.

70
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And I said that this time the home life was a little frosty because at least it was so disappointed. So I said, OK, I'll do that.

71
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Have I told you any of this at all? No, OK.

72
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So the offer came back and he said we can pay you $200 or $300 more per year, that's maybe 5% or 6% increase.

73
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And so I asked Paul what he thought about all this. And he invited me to come up to his home one evening after hours, five o'clock or so.

74
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can't remember exactly. So I went up to $4,500 per point. Whatever the street number is or yeah, he's Allison, he's out on the Miranda and discussed the job.

75
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've been very active in research at Caltech, and a number of published papers, lots of things going. And I expressed to him my fear that I was not going to be able to get my research program going at Oregon State because it involved the construction of apparatus.

76
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You saw that apparatus. I had to build that by hand. There were extremely limited machine shop facilities. Nothing in the chemistry department at all. And I didn't see how I could get that instrument built at Oregon State.

77
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So I expressed all this to him and then told him that the actual number of hours that I was expected to be in contact with students was something like 15 or 16 hours a week just in the hands-on contact.

78
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:22,000
See, that's about 30 percent or a little bit more than that. 35 percent of the total time, not counting preparation or anything and that's the end polling.

79
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I leaned back and he was sitting side by side looking out over the valley and the swimming pool. He said, well, at least I don't know. He says 15 hours. He said, well, when I was at Oregon State, I was teaching 40 hours a week.

80
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That was the year that he was a sophomore and had been asked to handle a course for young women in home economics. I think at those who are taking chemistry as a requirement. That's where he met his wife, A. The Helen.

81
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Anyway, that's the story you know. So anyhow, he said 40 hours. He said, I don't know. He said, I think that Oregon State will not be a first-class institution for research in my time. And probably not on yours. These are his words.

82
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He said, on the other hand, that's not really important in a bigger sense. He said, if you didn't get your program going, at least it will be very happy there. Oregon is a wonderful place to live as you and I know. He said, I don't know. I think it might be worthwhile giving a chance. I think you could make it go on. You'd be very happy there.

83
00:12:35,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So with that encouragement, I told Gilbert up and said, yes, I would accept the offer. And my wife, of course, was delighted at this because at this time our son had just been born and we lived in Pasadena down below, not far from Caltech.

84
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And the smog would roll in the morning about 11 o'clock and she'd take the baby in, close all the doors and windows, keep them closed till about four in the afternoon when the winds reverse their direction and swept all the smog back out to sea again. And she could open things up. It was pretty hot too. So I had a hose in this garden cottage that I put on the root and turned on the water to keep it cool.

85
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:51,000
During the time that she was so to speak incarcerated. Anyway, that fall, I told Gilbert that I wouldn't be able to come in the fall by the fall term, but I could come January 1st.

86
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:20,000
January 1st was 1956. So this is all in 1955. This conversation went on. So I come January, we drove north after Christmas in times of a huge storm that actually led to flooding. This is a fine way for my wife to be introduced to the worst boat of Corvallas.

87
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know anything today about how it was then, but we drove up to Eugene, got the junction city and it turned out that the 99 West was closed because of water and the roads.

88
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There was a bus going up 99 East to Albany and I was our car, the baby in the back and we followed this bus very carefully up sometimes.

89
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The water almost up to the hubcaps of the car got to Albany and then it turned out that the road from Albany to Corvallas was okay.

90
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It wasn't underwater yet, but the road from Corvallas south on 99 West was underwater. So by that we managed to get the Corvallas and by three arrangements we had run out of the house of a faculty member that was going to be away for three months.

91
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So we had a place to move into immediately, all furnished, very nice house on Chinchimony over there against the hill and south. Well, you know where it is.

92
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It was very nice and turned out that everything was flooded the following day or two in Corvallas. You could hardly get around at all and then it turned cold later on and snow came and so on.

93
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So that was my introduction to Corvallas. I showed up to work on one of the early days and Gilbert told me, oh, they had a kind of a bonus to give me.

94
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And that was that I was going to be assigned a teach a course and graduate course and physical chemistry to organically and others.

95
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, this sounded like a bonus to him, but for somebody just coming there, I mean this was a lecture thrill or as a week and I had never done this course before. So I had all those lectures to prepare as well as stuff I was expected to do under Bill Coldwell's regime.

96
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So I had a very, very busy time and with a newborn in the house of my wife, you know, trying hard to the customer's self to life in a new place with a new baby in a husband who was up to his ears and work wasn't very easy.

97
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was pretty discouraged at the end of that term and as the terms were on, I took care to write down on a piece of paper divided into days and hours of the day for a week each week.

98
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How much time I was actually spending in duties connected with teaching by connected with that man in the in with students one on one preparation, including evening hours and everything else.

99
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I was averaging that first term 56 hours a week only in teaching related duties and so my fear is about getting my program started on the research side well well born out by that first experience.

100
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And of course I was expected not only to have a program going get my research going but I had to build this apparatus which meant that I had to design it sit down with I think I showed you just briefly folders with those drawings and that I had a drawing table my office and so I spent a lot of time with drawing these things.

101
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then Professor Youngter and physics had a fine physics shop and I went across to see him and he agreed you saved my life actually to allow one of the people in physics I think they had three or four machines who would be assigned to my job and he would do everything and he and I would be in one to one contact all the time.

102
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He reserved the right to retake this man off for any projects that physics needed of course since he was employed by physics and using the physics facilities and that worked out just beautifully took a long time to get the apparatus bill three or four years.

103
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But it was finally done and put together and we managed to make it go so that youngters facilities and his kindness really are responsible for getting me off the ground at Oregon State.

104
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So would describe the apparatus a little bit for me? Sorry.

105
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Describe the apparatus for me.

106
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh well the apparatus is what is called an electron defraction unit.

107
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It consists of the essential feature of it is an electron gun that will produce a well-colonated beam of electrons at the potential of about 60 kilobols.

108
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So it's a very energetic beam on the scale of the way chemistry operates.

109
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That beam is admitted to a large vacuum chamber.

110
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In my apparatus the whole thing has mounted vertically so the beam comes down into this vacuum chamber.

111
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And at the bottom of the beam let's say is a detecting beam which is in my case photographic film in those days of photographic plates but it's no photographic film.

112
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And this photographic film is 8 x 10 inches square and is perpendicular to the beam and is moved into position by mechanism that I built into the apparatus.

113
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And the apparatus is designed to study the structures of molecules and the gas phase by diffracting this beam of electrons from them.

114
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So we have a long nozzle that protrudes into the apparatus with a tip that passes that stops just about a millimeter short of where there's very fine high-powered electron beam is coming down.

115
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Now if in this nozzle which is a two with a fine tip on it you admit a gas into the chamber the gas shoots out the nozzle tip intersects the electron beam at right angles and produces what is called a diffraction pattern.

116
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This diffraction pattern consists of what happens is of course it's recorded on this photographic film at the underneath the nozzle and perpendicular to the beam.

117
00:21:45,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So the diffraction pattern is recorded on this in a set of diffuse rings of varying intensity and the spacing of these rings and their shapes of the pattern contain all the structural information about the length of the interatomic distances in the molecule.

118
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And so we take these patterns and we analyze them and out of that we can deduce the intimate details of the structures of these molecules in the gas phase.

119
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That is essentially it's a structure of a single molecule because so far apart they don't interact with one another as they shoot into the apparatus.

120
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And so that's what I was charged with or what I wanted to build in which I found the gut going.

121
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So all those years it's still running and running.

122
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah and it is running and right now and running beautifully we just did an experiment last week.

123
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Beautiful patterns we got for a new molecule were interested in.

124
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It doesn't take long for the experiment as quite interesting the technique is developed enormously since the days when I first entered the field at Caltech as a graduate student.

125
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And now the experiment that lasts is diffraction pattern you expose the photographic film to the diffraction pattern for only two or three minutes and you might want to make five different films or ten different films.

126
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So all tools you can do the entire experiment in a day if you push it everything.

127
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And that's all the data you need for what might be for a graduate student a year and a half of work analyzing it.

128
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So the apparatus mostly sits unused because we can quickly gather all the data we knew.

129
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I've had a lot of visitors who have come use the apparatus.

130
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And if I had a technician I could supply all the diffraction data for every group in the world.

131
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This technician did nothing but take diffraction pictures of substances involved.

132
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Now maybe a little more complicated because these are gas phase molecules.

133
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We admit them in the chamber as a gas.

134
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But that doesn't mean that they have to be a gas as you look at them. You can put them on the table.

135
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The fact is you've got to get them into the gas phase in order to make this experiment work.

136
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Well we have a sort of ovens and heated nozzles so we can heat these things up and get the vapor.

137
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
See 60 that we have worked on of course is very intractable as no vapor pressure at all to speak of.

138
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So we had to heat this substance in an oven to 800 and some odd degrees Celsius in order to get the tiniest bit of vapor from it.

139
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But that was sufficient to give us the diffraction pattern and we were able to determine the structure of this material which is a carbon-like powder on the table.

140
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So we have all sorts of exiliar apparatus which allows us to produce gas molecules from lots of different circumstances.

141
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So it works very nicely. I'm very happy with it.

142
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I should add as a post-cryptolist that this technique was very powerful through the 40s and 50s and 60s even in the 70s.

143
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But there are other techniques that have developed in the meantime too.

144
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And so there are fewer laboratories in the world doing this work.

145
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:17,000
When I came to Oregon State and got mine going there were about, there were only two laboratories in the United States.

146
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Did this kind of work? Mine and a laboratory at Michigan.

147
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There were other people who, well there was another apparatus built.

148
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It didn't, it worked for a while but not very long.

149
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And there was one of Texas that was built, similar to look, but it was built in the physics department and the interest there was not the same as the interest that chemists had.

150
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And so it worked for a while and then it stopped.

151
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And later on there were apparatuses in Britain.

152
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
There was one at Edinburgh.

153
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And later on, and still extant is one in Reading, England.

154
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There was one in Germany. They were very active in Germany.

155
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And when I first started there was one in Belgium and one in Holland.

156
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And several in at that time the Soviet Union.

157
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And two or three laboratories in Japan.

158
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
All of them had apparatus and could do experiments.

159
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
All of those are gone except the apparatus in Reading.

160
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The apparatus in Germany by the way, the man who was the professor who was in charge of that laboratory retired.

161
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
His name was Heinz Oberhummer.

162
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And his apparatus has been transferred to an inorganic chemist who is using it as kind of an exudery to his main work, which is the preparation.

163
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And interesting inorganic compounds.

164
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And as a part of that he wants to know what those structures are.

165
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The apparatus in Reading is still extant.

166
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But the man who was in charge of it before has now retired.

167
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And a woman that was working with him has a permanent position at the university.

168
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But she's heavily involved with teaching and has very little time to work with it.

169
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There were two important laboratories in Norway. I didn't mention them earlier.

170
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Both of them are now gone as far as apparatus is concerned.

171
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:11,000
There isn't any further support for it in that in science decisions are always made about where you're going to put a limit of the amount of phones.

172
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And in Norway it's now determined that this particular area of research will not be supported anymore by the university in the sense that they will hire technicians and professional-ranked people to do this kind of work.

173
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I fear that will probably be the case here at Oregon State, too.

174
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So we don't know.

175
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The plain fact is it's not judged by what's going on in the world of chemistry today, cutting-edge stuff.

176
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:57,000
A lot of the things that's going on today is shifted more into larger molecule, biological things, synthetic organic chemistry, new materials, things of that sort.

177
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And not the kind of basic science that I was involved with for all those years.

178
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So anyway, I came to Oregon State, got it built, and I've been here ever since doing this kind of research.

179
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That's what it's all about. It's been great fun.

180
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So what were the techniques that you used to analyze the detection patterns initially?

181
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, yes, that's a good question. I don't know how much of the technology I ought to go into.

182
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Essentially, you're faced with this photographic film, which you hold it up to the light. You see this beautiful pattern of circular rings of varying intensity, very diffuse, easily recognized going out from a central point.

183
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And all the information about the structure of the molecules contained, as I said earlier, in the spacings and the shapes of these rings.

184
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The question then you're really asking is how do you go from that to determine how the molecules put together?

185
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, it turns out that these rings are related to the structure of the molecule by some, according to theory, by in a rather simple way.

186
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Keep it as simple as I possibly can. Every interatomic distance in the molecule creates an effect on this film, a pattern that consists of nothing more than a sine wave, going from the middle out.

187
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The sine wave just goes up and down, up and down, up and down, all the way out to the end of the photographic plate.

188
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So if you have a die-accomming molecule, all rings in their intensity would look like a sine wave, just from the beginning, up, down, down, down, down.

189
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The spacing would be identical between them, aside from some geometric factors that I don't have to go into.

190
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:15,000
All you have to do is to measure the frequency, oh, I should say that the farther apart the two atoms are that are giving rise to this sine wave, the greater the frequency of the sine wave.

191
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So two atoms that are far apart like this give a sine wave that goes up and down very rapidly.

192
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Two atoms that are very close together will give a sine wave that has a very long wavelength.

193
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So you'll see very few rings. So all you'd have to do is to measure the spacing between these rings, and that is related by theory to how far apart the atoms are.

194
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Well, now that's for a die-atomic, let's say that's the case for a die-atomic molecule, you only have one sine wave.

195
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The die-atomic molecule vibrates, and so the atoms are not rigid, they're moving back and forth away from one another, like two balls on a spring.

196
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And of course that means that the distance is in constant. Well, it turns out according to theory to a good approximation, this sine wave instead of having constant amplitude all the way up, dies off due to this vibration.

197
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So you measure the dying off of the sine wave, and that tells you how big the amplitude of this vibration is.

198
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So we learn about two things, the distances between the atoms on the average, and we learn about how much they're moving with respect to one another by measuring the damping off of the sine wave.

199
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, of course there aren't many die-atomic molecules left to study, but every that problem, or rather the theory that I mentioned applies to just the pairs of atoms.

200
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So if you have a molecule that has more than just two atoms in it, you're going to have more than two distances, more than one distance.

201
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Every pair of atoms in the molecule gives rise to one of these sine waves.

202
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So carbon dioxide is a linear molecule, is a carbon oxygen bond, and that gives rise to a single sine wave that goes out.

203
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
There are two of them, but they have exactly the same distance, so there are two sine waves that are right on top of one another.

204
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Then you have the distance between the oxygen atoms, and that's twice as big.

205
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So it generates a sine wave also, which has a frequency, twice as great to first approximation as the frequency of the carbon oxygen, because the distance is twice as long.

206
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And that gives a sine wave that oscillates with twice the frequency of the first one, and then they're on top of one another.

207
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So the pattern is no longer a simple sine wave, but a collection of two sine waves.

208
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
If you know how to separate out these sine waves and measure their frequencies, then you know exactly what the structure of this molecule is.

209
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The two were bent, like NL2 is, NL2 would be entirely similar, but there you would find the distances between the oxygen atoms, the distance between the oxygen atoms, is not twice the distance between the nitrogen and oxygen, because it's a triangular molecule, like this.

210
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So that oxygen distance would not be moving twice the frequency of the NL, but less than that.

211
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So you can immediately determine that distance, and determine the nitrogen oxygen distance, and by comparing them, you know what the bond angle is in the molecule.

212
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
This simple account can be applied to molecules that are very, very complicated.

213
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The entire problem, then, is just to separate out what these different sine waves are.

214
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Construct yourself a model that will account for all of the distances, and then you have the structure of the molecule.

215
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It is in practice considerably more complicated than I'm telling you, but that's essentially the features of the whole thing.

216
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Now you ask how we do this. Well, we have to measure the frequencies, and to do that we have a scanner, what is called a microdensitometer.

217
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The film is placed on the bed of this microdensitometer, and the film in the apparatus that I have, we have a mechanism that rotates the film around its center.

218
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The purpose of this is that you are averaging the information around the entire circle.

219
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That is, if the densitometer consists of a beam that passes through the film, and a detector that measures how intense the light beam is as it comes through the film.

220
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So, when the ring is intense, the light beam that comes through is much reduced, and when the film is more transparent, the beam that comes through there is more intense.

221
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So, you get a recording of the blackness of the film.

222
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So, this thing translates, and we have an electronic data accumulation system that measures the intensity of the blackness of the film as a function from the center outward.

223
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And that gives us digital data, and that is what we actually work with to analyze.

224
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, that is essentially it. And without having you in the laboratory for a week, I can't tell you much more that when I get clear here I don't think.

225
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So, any other questions about that?

226
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm wondering how would you decide which molecules to study?

227
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, well, this largely comes from your own interest, or in my case my own interest, let's say, or the principal investigator's interest.

228
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Now, if we take C60 for example, that was big news at the time it was discovered.

229
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And I had a former student named Bob Johnson, who was working at IBM in San Jose.

230
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And they had managed to create or had a sample of this stuff.

231
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Now, in the beginning it was very rare. I mean, a few...

232
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, you could get it in milligram quantities.

233
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I, the sample that I actually worked with, I think had 300 milligrams in it.

234
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And it was a little bit of black powder in a vial. And at going market prices that was $5,000 worth of sample.

235
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Well, Bob wrote to me and he asked me, how could we do this? Could you do this work?

236
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I said, well, I don't know, it's very exciting, we should try.

237
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And so, they supplied the sample.

238
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Several people in IBM and were involved in this project and leasing me up here.

239
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And so we got the sample and we managed to...

240
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It was very exciting because I didn't know whether we were going to be able to get a pattern from this stuff at all.

241
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Because it was so refractory, you know, we had to heat it so hot.

242
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And the other thing we had it was so hot it was going red in the apparatus.

243
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Now, fortunately, the film that we use is not very sensitive to red light.

244
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Secondly, I was able to build a shield around the novel that protected the film from almost all of the glow.

245
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
As I heated it up, I could see it glowing bright red in there.

246
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And then I would close up the window to the apparatus and turn off the beam,

247
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
lecture on beam and quickly move the plate in position.

248
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Open up the beam and expose this.

249
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I could not see evidence of any... we have a fluorescent screen in there that we can see patterns on for most molecules.

250
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:13,000
At the time we did the experiment, I couldn't see anything on this fluorescent screen other than a very faint glow from the screen.

251
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So I didn't know whether we were getting anything or not.

252
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And so we made two or three of these exposures.

253
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And I took the film into the dark room and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw a beautiful pattern was...

254
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You couldn't have predicted it would be like that.

255
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Or that you would even get one from seeing there was no evidence.

256
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Normally, when I run stuff on the apparatus, I put the main beam through a slot on a fluorescent screen so I can see the scattering all around it.

257
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And I can see it, you know, just... it'll look like this on a black thing, somewhat reduced.

258
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I can see we're getting scattering. I couldn't see that with C60.

259
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And yet there it was.

260
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And it's absolutely beautiful pattern.

261
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It was very exciting.

262
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And was that a complicated analysis?

263
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Was it what?

264
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
A complicated analysis?

265
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, it turns out...

266
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Bucky balls...

267
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
If you pick up a soccer ball...

268
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And you look to see how the things are put together.

269
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
There are hexagons in it and pentagons in it.

270
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And they are put together in a completely symmetric way.

271
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And it turns out that in Bucky balls or on a soccer thing,

272
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the length of the stitching in a soccer ball...

273
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah, it's a little hard to describe, but there are bonds that link two six-member patches together.

274
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And stitches that link a six-member to a five-member.

275
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And those two bond lengths are different in C60 itself.

276
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Those are the only two parameters that are necessary to determine the structure of C60.

277
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Assuming that it is a soccer ball.

278
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's the assumption that you make.

279
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And that was well characterized by NMR spectra and other things.

280
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So we knew it was a soccer ball type,

281
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but we didn't know what the length of these bonds were.

282
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So if you then have the only thing that changes...

283
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It doesn't change the shape.

284
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It only changes the size of the six-member and the five-member ring as you change the length of these bonds.

285
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Well, we had to put together a model,

286
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
that is to say, that would...

287
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You see, what you actually do in analysis...

288
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You have the experimental pattern,

289
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and then you have to generate a model

290
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and compare the pattern that this model gives

291
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
with the one that you experience experimentally.

292
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So you are fitting a model for which you have calculated a pattern,

293
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and you adjust that pattern to fit the experiment by changing the parameters of the model.

294
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So to make this...

295
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Applying this to C60,

296
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the pattern depends only on the relative lengths of those two distances that I mentioned.

297
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The one between six-membered rings and the one between the six-membered ring.

298
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And so my wife then put together the model,

299
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and you can imagine it's not easy.

300
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
You have to remember,

301
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
generate every distance in the molecule

302
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
from just these two parameters.

303
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
There are 720 distances in the molecule,

304
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and she constructed a program that would calculate this model for us.

305
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And that was the one we used and tested,

306
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and that led finally to the fitting and the structure of the thing.

307
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And we published that in science some couple of decades ago now, I guess.

308
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
There are lots of fun.

309
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
One did I ask also about Z-N-Hex-A-Floor?

310
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Which one?

311
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, Z-N-Hex-A-Floor?

312
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We never actually finished the structure of that thing,

313
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
because a friend of mine at the University of Michigan had done a very good job,

314
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and he was in the head of us.

315
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We worked on other Z-N-On compounds.

316
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We did Z-N-On tetroxide,

317
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,000
which is four oxygen atoms arranged in the form of a tetrahedron around a Z-N-On atom.

318
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And that was quite an experience,

319
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
because it was a very explosive compound.

320
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We had several minor explosions with it.

321
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You couldn't, we had to generate the compound on the apparatus

322
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
by adding acid to a

323
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
per-Z-N-Hex-A-Floor.

324
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
A per-Z-N-Hex-A-Floor is a compound which contains Z-N-On with the,

325
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
but it's a salt.

326
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And we had to build an apparatus where we could tip this up slightly

327
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and add acid to this where upon the Z-N-On tetroxide would be formed

328
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and could flow into our apparatus through our nozzle.

329
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Several times the stuff in our gas phase is very unstable.

330
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We had several times very minor explosions

331
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and minor in the sense that there was no danger to anybody involved here,

332
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
but it blew holes in our conducting line right away.

333
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So we had that happen several times.

334
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That's the only Z-N-On compound that we actually finished the structure on.

335
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Z-N-On tetroxide.

336
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Were there other compounds that are particularly memorable or rewind?

337
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Well, the ones that we've talked about are one sort of in the public eye.

338
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So I think in terms of public interest of something very novel,

339
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
not so much.

340
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The work that we do, I've always tended to characterize in the term used in the old days,

341
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
which is basic research.

342
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I had no really discernible practical applications,

343
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
but it was fundamental stuff,

344
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and there are a lot of fundamental problems in chemistry.

345
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
For example, chemistry, as it is practiced,

346
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
at some level or another,

347
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:49,000
makes continuous and intimate use of the concept of the structure of the things you're dealing with.

348
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I mean, we talk about the structural proteins, for example.

349
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We talk about the structure of almost everything in organic chemistry,

350
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
structures when he lectures on the board.

351
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So we were involved in determining structures,

352
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
but what we were doing is actually measuring these structures

353
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
to very high precision.

354
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
We're not just making a ball and stick drawing.

355
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We're looking at the distances between the atoms and trying to deduce from this.

356
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
How these distances might be related to the reactivity of the molecule and things of that sort.

357
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Now, how the intimate details of the structure, distances?

358
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Well, let's me put it this way, size and shape of the molecule are related to its reactivity.

359
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I can give you one example of this,

360
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that most people don't know about,

361
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but a very common chemical compound in nature is nitrogen dioxide that comes from combustion of internal engines under high temperatures and so on.

362
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Well, nitrogen dioxide is a triangular molecule

363
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
with a nitrogen at the apex.

364
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And two of these nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide molecules,

365
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
come together and they form a tetramer, I'm in a dimer,

366
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that has, it's called, di-nitrogen tetroxide then.

367
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Now, a remarkable thing of this is that these two molecules come together and fall apart,

368
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
come together and fall apart just so easily.

369
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
If you have N02 in the gas phase, you have N204 in the gas phase also,

370
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
as you change the temperature and pressure the amount of one of these with respect to the other changes.

371
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Well, N204 is very hard to, it falls apart so easily, it's very hard to measure.

372
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
The structure on it, but way under took that job.

373
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And the way it was done is that we,

374
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
we got a sample of N02

375
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and the reaction for the decomposition or our dimerization or de-dimerization is extremely rapid.

376
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It just flows apart immediately or comes together immediately.

377
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, if you cool it down, the stream down, what happens is you get more and more of N204,

378
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
as you heat it up, all of this is decomposed right away because of the thermal effects.

379
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So what we did was cool the sample, cool the oven,

380
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
sorry, the nozzle way, way down, well, way down below zero Celsius,

381
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
run the stuff through it and we got beautiful pictures of N204.

382
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Then we heated it up a little bit and we could see all the characteristic distances for that molecule beginning to disappear.

383
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
As if the higher we heated it, the less of those we had,

384
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
we got it to 100 and some odd degrees, there's nothing but N02 present.

385
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, the structure of N204 turned out to be very interesting.

386
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It turns out that there is an extraordinarily long N bond.

387
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The bonds between atoms in typical compounds tend to be more or less the same.

388
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
For example, saturated hydrocarbons have carbon-carbon bonds and I can tell you right away

389
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
there will be 1.54 or 1.535 angstroms to within 100th of an angstrom

390
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and no matter what compound you look at.

391
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Well, there's a characteristic N N bond, two NNO bonds.

392
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And it turned out that this N N bond was very, very long.

393
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So much so that by a simple criterion that Linus Pauling had produced one time,

394
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
it's only in the order of a tenth as strong as a normal single bond.

395
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So that accounts for what both the power varies.

396
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But one thing that's characteristic of single bonds is that the two ends of the molecule can rotate around like this.

397
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You see, they're not fixed like this because the bond is a weak.

398
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
To our intense surprise, that's not the case of N204.

399
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's a flat, plainer molecule no matter how long this bond is.

400
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So what is it that holds a flat, you see?

401
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Well, it's not a single bond, don't hold things flat.

402
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Why is this flat?

403
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Well, that was the interesting question of the time.

404
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And it turns out that the structure of the N02 part of the N204 molecule

405
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
is almost identically that of the separated N02.

406
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That is bringing the two together to make the dime or doesn't change the structure of the ends at all.

407
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Normally, if you bring them together, if you take two monomers and you bring them together,

408
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
these will change somewhat in angles and distances, not within 204.

409
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But these are puzzles that are just lots of fun to think about.

410
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
That's all.

411
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And so this kind of research is the thing that's characterized what Lisa and I have done most of our career here.

412
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We have all sorts of different systems that pose different basic chemical questions.

413
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And we look at molecules to try to find out what we can learn about these basic chemical questions,

414
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
answers to them from studying the structures of maybe even a series of several molecules that have other,

415
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:14,000
some things in common, some things different to see how the differences and so on affect the properties of the molecules.

416
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So that's what we do.

417
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So you got your apparatus constructed, do I presume that you're piecing wood, decreased some?

418
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Well, in due course, and those days the chemistry department consisted of four divisions.

419
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There was organic, inorganic, physical and analytical.

420
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They were pretty clearly defined.

421
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
People were in these divisions in accordance with the kind of research they did.

422
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Well, they came in opening in physical chemistry and Gilbert as chairman told me immediately that

423
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
when that opening occurred, he was going to move me into that division.

424
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Well, this was two or three years later.

425
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The other, oh, but the two jobs were filled that this monitoring of the laboratories that brought me here,

426
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
called well, so efforts.

427
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
The other person was Tom Parsons.

428
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Tom Parsons was in chemistry for a while, but moved into administration and finished his career here as an administrator.

429
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Well, that I moved into physical chemistry, Gilbert, and I became a physical chemist of my teaching responsibility has changed a lot.

430
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I no longer rode herd on the TAs, but I still taught general chemistry, but I also began to teach courses regularly in physical chemistry.

431
00:56:49,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So my contact hours went down, but the amount of time I spent working certainly didn't because now I had the contact hours before,

432
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I knew the experiments and freshmen chemistry the kids were doing, and I could walk through and make sure that they were getting a proper attention.

433
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:20,000
But now I had to prepare lectures and courses that I hadn't lectured in before.

434
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But the contact hours went down, but the amount of time spent teaching didn't diminish for quite a while.

435
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But nevertheless, my apparatus was coming along, and I was very lucky when I came here because I had all the money I needed to build this.

436
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I got some money from the research corporation before I arrived, I applied for that at Caltech, and I came with a Sloan Foundation grant, which was five years of money that I used for summer support when I wasn't teaching.

437
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And then I could do it fully to drawing up parts from my apparatus and so on.

438
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And then I got NSF support too, so I've never lacked for funding the main thing that I've had trouble with is the time in the early days, not in the later days.

439
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So things have turned out later days that teaching loads gradually began to fall into a...

440
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh, I don't want to put it...

441
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I want to put it a range that was consistent with what we're being taught at other institutions with which we competed the time.

442
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
So there was still a lot of teaching, but it was a kind that there was really lots of funding.

443
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
What was the environment like in the department back then?

444
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Oh, it was very collegial. Collegial was at the word.

445
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We were all very friendly with one another. I mean, socially, I had friends in physical chemistry and organic chemistry.

446
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:31,000
And we saw one another at analytical chemistry at dinner parties. We did lots of things together. New Year's Eve parties and so on.

447
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So it was, in my opinion, a lot more cohesive than it is at the moment.

448
00:59:39,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And at the time, a lot more cohesive at Oregon State than in many institutions. In many institutions, there is a kind of a very wary attitude or outlook from one divisional type to another.

449
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And sometimes even within the members of the division, you have to realize that university teaching, university careers can be very competitive, especially those that depend on the good deal on research that you do as well as on your teaching.

450
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And so you read about this all the time of the press of people that are competing for even publicly sometimes for priority and some major discovery.

451
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So, but we never had any of that in chemistry. We just had a very good time. That's been a fine place.

452
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
At what point did Lisa start working at OSE?

453
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I'm sorry? At what point did Lisa start working at OSE?

454
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Oh! That was a history that is very interesting. Lisa decided, did I mention how we met? Yeah, well, when we came to the stage, she was a scientist and we worked together at Caltech.

455
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:25,000
She was actually paid at Caltech and we worked in Electro-Indafraction. They are both of us together in the same project.

456
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Did several things happen? Then when we came to Oregon, she was very busy, of course, with our son, who was only three months old when we arrived.

457
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So she did no work at all at that point except, well, that's not quite true because we did manage to find some babysitting for a few hours a day now and then when she could come to the university.

458
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But she was never away from home more than two or three hours at a time then.

459
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And that, a couple of years later, our daughter was born, so then we had two kids at home.

460
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And so by and large, she worked only sporadically until the kids got into nursery school when she could then drive them up.

461
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
They were on Orchard Street here and the University of Orchard School, which has changed its location, I think, somewhat.

462
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But the kids would go there and she would come to the laboratory and then when they were sessions over, she'd take them up to go home.

463
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And we live very close to the Jefferson School, so until both of them got into school, she was home most of the time.

464
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But managed to put in several hours per week working on our projects at that time.

465
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Then when the kids went to Jefferson School, she could in the morning, the kids would get to us, I'd go off to work, the kids would get to our school and start, they would run out the front door, go over to the school and we'd let the teachers know what phone to call.

466
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Then Lisa would get into her car and drive over to the university and we would work until about two or three years old.

467
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Two or three years old, when she would get in the car and go home, park the car and get in the house and the kids would run out of the school and come back.

468
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:46,000
They never knew she actually worked because of course they were concerned she was there when they left and there when it came home.

469
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But she was able to work about half time then.

470
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:59,000
She was paid by a line on them, well a line on them in the budget for grants that had succeeded in getting.

471
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And then we also had joint grants.

472
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And then she's very good at mathematics and she was hired by the computer center to be working on, she was very good at programming and so on.

473
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
She was kind of on the edge on with chemistry and programming in the computer center.

474
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That was when we still had centralized computing.

475
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Then we had one rhubarb.

476
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I might have told you this, I haven't before but it went something like this.

477
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Gilbert had retired and Bert Prisnsson had become chairman.

478
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And Lisa had been working on my grant for the line item and the budget for her salary.

479
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And the proposal that had been department chairman had to sign the proposal and Bert did that.

480
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And so it was funded.

481
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Again, he decided one time that she could no longer work on the grant after the present year was over academic year.

482
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And so she wrote him a letter and pointed out that she had item for a salary was never explained what the reason was.

483
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And he responded and she wrote again and he didn't respond.

484
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It turned out in retrospect that he was greatly afraid that there would be some negative feeling about a man and wife working together in the chemistry department.

485
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Because at that time there was not on her though but it was a little unusual.

486
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The thing was she was not being paid on state funds at all.

487
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And she was an expert in the field in which there were no other west of the Mississippi.

488
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Well, he persisted in this.

489
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So we finally went over together to the dean who was Vern Schellelman at that time.

490
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And I knew him very well from years.

491
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I said, Vern, look, this is a situation.

492
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
He said, well, why didn't you tell me this before?

493
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I said, well, Lisa said this too.

494
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, we were going through channels.

495
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Our issue was not with you.

496
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So he looked at this and he said, well, she can certainly work on the grant.

497
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:50,000
The proposal by the way had been signed by Bert and now he was refusing to continue on a funding even though he has signed the agreement.

498
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So he overturned this.

499
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But then he said,

500
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:04,000
if Lisa wants to work in the future she will have to have her name on the grant, not just worked on your grant.

501
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Well, I can't remember much of the details following that but it turned out that

502
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Chrisence One was about to retire.

503
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
There are circumstances here that I don't need to go into but anyway, he was going to retire

504
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and a new one man was going to come.

505
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And I was on a national committee at the time and I was a former friend of mine at Caltech named Dave Schumacher.

506
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It was on the same committee.

507
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And Dave and I mentioned to him, he was from Idaho, of course, and gone to Reed College.

508
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We had gone to Caltech together.

509
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
He finished a little earlier than I did.

510
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I said, Dave, would you, we need a new department chairman.

511
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
He was chairman of the committee.

512
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I was on. I saw how good he was at a miniserink thing.

513
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Would you, by any criteria,

514
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
even consider coming back, maybe being considered as our department chairman?

515
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And there was a lot of talk about this that he decided that, yes, he might like that.

516
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
He was at MIT at the time.

517
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So we invited him out.

518
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And he was off of the job and he liked Oregon.

519
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You know, I was very, very similar to a group and went to school employment.

520
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
But one of the criteria for him coming was that his wife would be able to work.

521
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Here was another man on the wife team.

522
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
She was a cross-logger for as he was.

523
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And Mick Vickerer was the chairman of this time.

524
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,000
One of the conditions for him coming was that his wife be allowed to work.

525
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And then he said, oh, by the way, he says, you know, Ken and Lisa have the same problem.

526
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And so Mick Vickerer came around to Dave.

527
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
He says, that's no problem.

528
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
He says, I've looked this all up.

529
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:13,000
He says two members of the same family cannot work, not only in the same department or same institution,

530
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:24,000
but in the same entire system of higher education, except under unusual circumstances.

531
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And he said, this is Mick Vickerer's words.

532
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
So Dave related them to me.

533
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,000
He said, I regard a man and wife's scientific team as an unusual circumstance.

534
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So Dave came.

535
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
His wife was allowed to work with him.

536
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And at the same time, Lisa was allowed to work with me.

537
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The really remarkable and most interesting thing about this, there was one small attempt to cover the tracks here.

538
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And that was that Clara Schumacher was responsible to me.

539
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And Lisa was responsible to Dave for monitoring purposes.

540
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But of course, Dave came around and said, well, he said, how's Lisa doing?

541
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Fine, I said, then he says, how's Clara doing?

542
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I said, oh, fine.

543
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
So that was that.

544
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
That was the monitoring.

545
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And of course, that all disappeared in the end.

546
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
But in retrospect, it's pretty funny.

547
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So that's how we were able to continue.

548
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
So Lisa did a lot of computer work?

549
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Pardon?

550
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Lisa did a lot of computer work?

551
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Well, yeah, but not just computer work.

552
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
She's a special expert in programming.

553
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
That has evolved during the ages that we've been here.

554
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But she is responsible for all the basic materials that we use in our research, even today.

555
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Some of these programs have been modified by others and even added to by others.

556
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But the basic thing, she is responsible for.

557
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That's very funny.

558
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Can you reflect on the early days of the unit computers in your work?

559
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Computers on work?

560
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
You can get your computers in your work, yeah.

561
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
In my work?

562
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Yeah, well.

563
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Yes.

564
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:55,000
When I left Caltech, we had some IBM office machines.

565
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And we were able to operate them using IBM punched cards.

566
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
We had a very, for the time, very efficient system for doing the calculations

567
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and necessary for our work and electron diffraction.

568
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:19,000
When I came to Oregon State, we didn't have this IBM setup here at all.

569
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But the mathematics department had managed to,

570
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:34,000
the applied aspect of mathematics here was very interested in computers.

571
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And the central computer by IBM had been developed a few years earlier.

572
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And there was a computer that they managed to buy in mathematics.

573
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
It was called an all-act three E.

574
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
They sold a few of these things.

575
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And we had one here.

576
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It was set up and running in mathematics and the basement.

577
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It was a tube machine.

578
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I mean, it was a huge thing with tapes and vacuum tubes.

579
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Transistors hadn't been invented yet.

580
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
At least were not available in a device like this.

581
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And so we wrote together.

582
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I did programming when I first came here.

583
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
There was no compiler for this machine.

584
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So we had to write things in machine language.

585
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And I learned enough to do that and wrote the very earliest programs in machine language

586
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
that would run on the all-wack three E.

587
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Well, the all-wack three E, as our analytical scheme improved,

588
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:55,000
the programs got more and more lengthy as far as that machine was concerned.

589
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And the machine, by this time, was beginning to teeter a bit.

590
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And there were some graduate students over there on mathematics

591
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
that managed to know what tubes to interchange and exchange

592
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and for the keep this thing running.

593
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
But we had to write our early programs in such a way.

594
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
We didn't rely on the machine because it would make errors due to faulty hardware.

595
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And so we wrote our programs in such a way that we could run them twice

596
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
and if we got the same answer, we could continue to the next stage.

597
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And at least I wrote those programs.

598
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Then, by the way, I had some money and to use the machine, you had to pay.

599
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So I, at one stage, gave them a few hundred dollars from one of my grants

600
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
against future computing so they could buy vacuum tubes to put into this machine.

601
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Believe it or not.

602
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Harvard Lonseth was the chairman of mathematics at that time. Very nice guy.

603
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So, a couple of years later, it turned out that statistics had gotten hold of an IBM machine.

604
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It was running on punch cards, but they had a compiler and so on.

605
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And so we moved to that. That was a central computer. They charged also.

606
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But it was a much better machine than the 1410, I think it was called.

607
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And then things progressed around here. We were still doing central computing.

608
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:56,000
There was a central computing center that was set up and they bought a CDC machine.

609
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And that CDC machine was better still, faster.

610
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And by this time, we had altered our programming so that we could access the machine remotely

611
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,000
through a telephone line and we had a teletype terminal in the laboratory.

612
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So on data from our experiments could be put out on punched paper tape.

613
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And that punched paper tape could be fed into our terminal and carried over to the computer.

614
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
We thought this was boy, we were really ahead of things there. It was great.

615
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Then it turned out that was heavy demand for that machine.

616
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And the amount of storage we needed for some of our programs was huge and they didn't have enough of it, see?

617
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So we were limited into how much storage we could use in any of our programs.

618
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:13,000
So Lisa very, very cleverly took our biggest most demanding programs and created it to operate with overlays and so on.

619
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That instead of saving something she determined what would be needed and wrote the program.

620
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So succeeding stages could write right over this stuff.

621
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And so this occurred and in that way the program became very efficient as far as space was concerned.

622
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And then we still needed space so I talked to them over there and they said, oh well you can have more space after the hours of such and such.

623
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So we would set our stuff to run on this machine at a later time.

624
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Then of course that was the time that Lisa, one of the times when Lisa was hired to be working over there.

625
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Then the central computing of course began to gradually disappear as PCs came in.

626
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And right away, well before that happened in chemistry we determined that we needed a computer locally.

627
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And we managed to get a grant, several of us, pooled our knowledge and resources and made a proposal and we were able to buy a Vax.

628
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And Lisa then converted all our programs to run on the Vax and that was tremendous.

629
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And we have lots of programs including plotting ones. We had a plot error also. That would work just fine.

630
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And then of course the Vax began to be phased out.

631
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And we had a PDP 11 in our laboratory finally, Lisa and me.

632
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And so some of our stuff was ran on that.

633
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But this is all very closely stuff.

634
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And the PDP 11 used large disks like this, floppy disks that were 8 inches or 10 inches in diameter.

635
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Then PCs began to appear on the scene.

636
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And so at one stage or another I could see that there was going to be no expertise around at all, what knew anything about PDP 11's.

637
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Everything was going to be going to PCs. So if we wanted to keep current and not be high and dry, that is something happened to the PD 11 nobody would know what to do.

638
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So we converted all of our stuff to run on PCs.

639
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And all of our data, all through the years had been stored on these disks on the PDP 11.

640
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Well, we hired a guy to convert all of the stuff on the PD 11 onto disks that could in a format that can be used on smaller, well smaller but faster PCs.

641
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And these were all on floppy disks like this. Well, pretty soon those disappeared.

642
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And we had to convert them to some other medium.

643
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And so we took all of this stuff and copied them all over on the CDs that are now like this.

644
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And I have a host of things on CDs.

645
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Also a whole pile of stuff on these floppies, all catalogued.

646
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And I've maintained on a couple of the PCs in my laboratory a floppy disk drive that will still accept these old ones.

647
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
There's no reason to change it to anything else.

648
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
But now we've gone to extremely fast computers.

649
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:28,000
A calculation on the all WAC3E would take us two days we can now do in about 10 seconds, something like that.

650
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And they're so fast now and the storage is so enormous.

651
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I can get a program going into the hit return.

652
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I can't get my hands on my lap before all the information is on the screen again.

653
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It's been a total revolution.

654
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Well, in the midst of all this, some place back we had a special tectronics sculpt,

655
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
which could feed data inward plump things for us. We could see it on the screen there.

656
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And my son later went on to a electric engineering degree and Stanford.

657
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And as a software engineer at Microsoft, now when he was in high school, he loved these computers.

658
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And he could program also.

659
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And so he played it, believe it or not, a big role in some of the very early developing,

660
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
because when he was at Stanford, he would come home and say, well, what do you need now, Dad?

661
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Still interested in that.

662
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I should say one other thing.

663
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Our kids were kind of interested in science.

664
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And so Eric and Lisa and I published a paper together on work that he had actually worked on the laboratory.

665
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And this is a paper by Hadberg, Hadberg, and Hadberg.

666
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And it was published in the journal of chemical physics.

667
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And a few years later, my daughter was interested and we published a paper,

668
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
another one by Hadberg, Hadberg, and Hadberg.

669
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And I never managed to get the two kids to the laboratory at the same time,

670
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:19,000
so we could have four Hadbergs on it.

671
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:27,000
One time I called up the journal editor of chemical physics.

672
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,000
A man named Willard Stout, way back when I said, this is Ken Hadberg.

673
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And he said, oh, of Hadberg, Hadberg, and Hadberg.

674
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Apparently he had noticed this.

675
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So anyway, that's more or less the story of computing.

676
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Okay, well, the last question for today, when we were at your office,

677
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we've seen the final folders and could you explain what the final folders are?

678
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So we have that in there.

679
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:06,000
What the final folders are, there are several stages in the analysis of a structure.

680
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And they begin with the raw data that we get from using this microdense automator

681
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
on the films or plates.

682
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And these raw data are the first things that go into the folder.

683
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Now, a lot of things have to be done to that raw data,

684
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:37,000
because after all, you're taking what is a continuous curve

685
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and you're sampling it at very small intervals along it,

686
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
so you have points that correspond to this.

687
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Now, when the plate or film moves across the dense automator,

688
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
it goes across the middle and back out on the other side.

689
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So we scan the film from one side to the other,

690
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
but all the time it's rotating, which means that half of the film

691
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
should be identical to the other half.

692
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And half of the trace should be identical to the other half.

693
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
But since you're sampling by points, you can't make sure that these points are identical.

694
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So you have to do something as we call, find the center.

695
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
So we have a program that compares the two sides of this

696
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and determines where the center is.

697
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And then it takes the data on one side and that on the other,

698
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
interpolates if necessary, between the points,

699
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
adds them all together to give you a scan.

700
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
That's all in there, finding the center.

701
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So we have the curve and counts.

702
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We have the curve curves that find the center.

703
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And then we have the data, which are just numbers.

704
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
We want to convert them to something which has a common basis.

705
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And because of the properties of the dense automator,

706
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
a very black film can give you the same range of numbers

707
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
that a very light film can.

708
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
But there's obviously a lot more scattering and one than in the other.

709
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,000
So we have a way of converting this information

710
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
to let us call it absolute densities.

711
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
It's not really that, but it really puts the two curves on the same scale.

712
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
In terms of darkness and so on.

713
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Then we have a number of programs that are designed to convert this.

714
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
There is a difference between the blackness of the film

715
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
and the intensity of the scattering.

716
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Now you can get a sense of this where, for example,

717
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
if you take a film and expose it for a second,

718
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
you get a certain darkness.

719
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Suppose it for two seconds you get another darkness.

720
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And of course, if in the right range,

721
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
the blackness of the second would be,

722
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
if you expose twice as long under identical condition,

723
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
the blackness would retry as great.

724
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Well, clearly, the longer you expose,

725
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
the less the photographic film is going to respond.

726
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
So pretty soon it gets black.

727
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And it doesn't matter how long you expose,

728
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
it's not going to get any blacker.

729
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:41,000
So the curve that relates blackness to intensity is not linear.

730
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
We have to find out how non-linear it is

731
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
in terms of how dark the film is.

732
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
So we have corrections for that.

733
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
We have a whole host of corrections that are built into this

734
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
that is designed to take the data from the film

735
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and put it into a form which compares with mathematically

736
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:16,000
with a theoretical function that we can calculate.

737
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And there are many steps in this process.

738
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Each one of these steps builds up to this point.

739
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Then when we've got all of that,

740
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:39,000
we then have, we do a number of calculations.

741
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
The most important of which is the final fitting procedure.

742
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And it's called a least squares adjustment.

743
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
So this is a program that fits the final model

744
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
to the experimental data.

745
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And the result of that is an output in the folder

746
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:06,000
that shows the fitting quality of this.

747
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And then there are often plots of the curves

748
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
at various stages of this procedure.

749
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
So it all goes into the line printer output,

750
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
which those days we call the final folder,

751
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
it might be anywhere from two inches thick,

752
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
well, anywhere from an inch thick to three inches thick, say.

753
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And that's what you saw in those line printer folders.

754
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Now we have almost the same thing nowadays.

755
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But it is all done eight and a half by eleven stuff, you see.

756
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
When we're doing a hard copy that we want to look at.

757
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But now we actually put all this stuff on a disk,

758
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
on a CD.

759
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
And it's all, we have folders on the computer for molecules

760
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
that contain all the information we want.

761
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And then some folders and some folders.

762
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And I take these, the major folder,

763
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and I'll just copy the whole thing over onto a CD.

764
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And I'll give it a name for the molecule

765
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
and everything we want.

766
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Now we can put on this CD, look in there,

767
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
we can find it right away.

768
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
So it's the hard copy stuff that you saw in the laboratory.

769
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Really is stuff that we stopped generating maybe twenty years ago.

770
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And the later stuff is all in either in folders

771
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:45,000
or hard copy or on devices like CDs.

772
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I read recently, some of them are saying CDs are going to disappear also.

773
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So maybe it'll all be on a thumb drive now, who knows.

774
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Okay, well we've been going for an hour and a half.

775
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
We'll call it a day to day.

776
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
All right, good.

777
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
All right.
