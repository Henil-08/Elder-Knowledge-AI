1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so we are doing so as in the past we've been introduced to self-forgift day

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,519
name.

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:18,000
My name is Kenneth Hedberg and this is the 20th of October 19th or 2011.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Okay, so today I would like to start with you telling us about the role that you played

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
in the following papers telling you already today.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,399
Yeah, well we talked about that last time I guess.

7
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,000
Did we or did we know?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, I have a uncomfortable feeling I'm repeating myself here but maybe not.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,600
The effort to bring the papers here began when I sat at the head table with the Helen

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Pauline during the meeting.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,320
Short in celebration of the awardee of the Pauline award which had been newly set up by

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:16,799
three sections of the American Chemical Society and she told me at that time that people,

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,599
several universities and other institutions were after Linus' papers but she said he didn't

14
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,280
want them to go to these institutions.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,199
She said they didn't want all of those papers and the University of Pennsylvania I've seen

16
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,759
you remember as one of them as well as Caltech and Stanford.

17
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,799
They only wanted slick proportions but they wanted them all together.

18
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,039
And so she said to me that she had felt for a long time that the papers ought to come to

19
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,560
Oregon State.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Now this was before Pauline relations with Oregon State had been repaired and she went

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,280
on to remark that she'd been talking to him and she was trying to persuade him that

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
he should let bygones be bygones.

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
So that was Linus' late year?

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh gosh, that was the early 60s.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry my memory was hazy on these exact dates but anyway, sometime now.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,719
So I conveyed this information when I got back to the institution to President of the

27
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:43,759
University who at that time was Professor Johnson and he called me and asked me if I thought

28
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:53,120
that Pauline would accept an invitation to come to the University and speak.

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,519
And I said well, it could well be the case it doesn't do any harm to try.

30
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,519
Now have I outlined the reasons before that Pauline did not want to come to the institution

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,519
and everything?

32
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,199
Oh, I thought we talked about that.

33
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,719
That's odd because well never mind.

34
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:27,079
In the late 40s there was a faculty member at Oregon State named Ralph Spitzer who was

35
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,879
denied tenure in the Department of Chemistry.

36
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:37,839
He was an excellent physical chemist and he raised the issue that he was being fired for

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:48,960
is politically found partly on the letter that he had written that was published in Chemical

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,360
and Engineering News.

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,759
Not supporting but at least saying that people ought to at least think about what this

40
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:06,800
fellow Lissenko in that time, the Soviet Union was saying about the effect of environment

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:14,400
on inheritance and of course this flew in the face of conventional wisdom of the time

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,639
that everything was inherited.

43
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:31,199
So at any rate the faculty at the chemistry department decided that they would not offer

44
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,319
him permanent tenure in which men of course that he had to leave.

45
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,719
Now I knew all the members of the chemistry department having been an undergraduate here

46
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:48,079
and consequence of this was that Ralph Spitzer asked the American Chemical Society for

47
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:57,240
hearing the issue of, I forgot what the ACS committee was but anyway the idea is that

48
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,240
you're not supposed to be discharged from a teaching position on grounds of your political

49
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
beliefs.

50
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:15,019
And at the 1948 meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco which I attended

51
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:22,040
Ralph made his case and he was strongly supported by Linus Pauling.

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,200
The upside of all this was that I don't think the ACS committee wanted to get its hands

53
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,480
too deeply involved in this thing and not much ever came of it but Pauling was rather

54
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,759
actively pursuing an ocean that Spitzer was a fine scientist and there could be no reason

55
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,040
that he shouldn't be kept on for professional reasons.

56
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Now AL Strand was president of Oregon State at that time and the news media or some media

57
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:07,720
made it brought up this knowledge of what Pauling had said and Strand got properly angry

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,200
and said well Oregon State can get along with outline as Pauling.

59
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,360
And Linus Pauling then said to the media when this was a part of the dream if they can

60
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,560
get along without Linus Pauling they will.

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:32,480
So from 1948 to all through the 50s and of course there was no Popeyes in 1954 and he

62
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:40,759
spies later on he had nothing to do with Oregon State but after Mrs. Pauling's comment to

63
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,400
me and my relay of this information to Johnson he called me and said as I said before I would

64
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:56,519
Pauling accept an invitation and due course this was tender to him and he agreed but he

65
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:02,959
was going to come here and he was not going to speak to the university as a whole not

66
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:09,879
going to speak to the chemistry department on scientific subject.

67
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:18,959
So there was a huge meeting held in the present Gilt Hall, C.M. and there was a podium set

68
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:27,920
up on one side of the floor and Stands were filled on the opposite side as this kind of

69
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
a stage.

70
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:39,520
And the head of time Johnson asked me if I would introduce Pauling.

71
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:48,759
Well as you think about that here is a distinguished scientist coming to speak to the university

72
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,319
and the present university is not introducing him.

73
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,040
An ordinary faculty member like me was asked to do so.

74
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:06,800
Well in my presence Pauling and I and Johnson made some other people with our Johnson and

75
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Barnley that I was going to introduce him and he turned to me and he says you're going

76
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,040
to introduce me Ken and I said yes he's asked me to do that.

77
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,920
Pauling didn't say a word but it was perfectly clear that he felt that it was appropriate for

78
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,200
the university president to do the introduction.

79
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,879
Well so anyway all of Mrs. Johnson and President Johnson made a hell of a polling and why

80
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,120
I was some Lisa and I got in the limo and we were chauffeur over to the hall of Sam and

81
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,759
everybody was sitting there waiting we filed in and went up on the stage and a few things

82
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:50,720
were said and then I rose to give my introduction which I did in a few minutes and about this

83
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,160
time this is Pauling was about to speak and filed a group of students.

84
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,279
They were all black and many prominent among them were many members of the football team

85
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,200
and this was at the time when the great pumpkin had decreased that football players were

86
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,920
not going to be able to wear a beard and at that point all hell broke loose and there were

87
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:22,679
meetings on the campus regarding free speech and the ability of the students to football

88
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:30,679
team to have a personal appearance as they wished and the great pumpkin insisted that

89
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:36,919
he finally resulted I think to saying that the beard didn't fit very well with a helmet

90
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:45,919
and so on and anyway and due course these people they set a few words and then they turned

91
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:54,360
and abruptly filed out and very well behaved and so Pauling gave his speech which was on

92
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:04,039
peace and very well received and so on and then at a dinner that evening Pauling said to me

93
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:10,839
she said oh that was I was so surprised she said I thought all these flocks that had

94
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:21,719
filed in were there were they were going to sing well that was the beginning of several

95
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:31,959
overtures Pauling he came back succeeding occasions but in the middle of all this well not in the

96
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,639
middle but I think at the beginning of all this I had reported to Johnson that Pauling that

97
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,759
Mississippi thought that Melinas' papers should come to Oregon State and of course that would

98
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:51,879
have been a great coup and so he gingerly broached the subject to Pauling I wrote him a letter about

99
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:02,679
this actually and Pauling and due course responded and saying that he would give it some thought

100
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:08,439
that he was not yet prepared to give up his papers because he was still actively using the

101
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:26,200
materials that were in and after Johnson retired he was succeeded by the picker and I didn't think a

102
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,240
great deal about this Pauling was now coming and doing occasion and it suddenly occurred to me

103
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,080
that I should forward the information that I had given to Johnson to him as well so I dug out

104
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:44,200
the correspondence that the letter that I had written and President Johnson's response to it

105
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:52,200
and typed another letter and sent it off to Dr. McPickery. Well this scenario was repeated and he

106
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,200
again queried Pauling on his papers this was now some several years later after the first

107
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:07,080
literature but he got the same response back Pauling wasn't yet ready to park with these papers

108
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:19,160
and time went on and John Byrne became president and once again I hold out these papers now

109
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,560
I have two sets of correspondence and wrote to John sent it off to him and his response was

110
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:35,959
a little bit different immediately he set up a committee on which I served and he made a

111
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:42,519
concrete offer to Linus Pauling at the others had him he said we are very unparafreshing him now

112
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:49,319
you could talk to John and find out exactly how this went but the legitimate was that he

113
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,280
said that they would create a they would not just set up a room or something they would create a

114
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,360
special collections in which he could he all of these papers could be housed they would build this

115
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:13,480
for him for him I think you see I only see these facts from what I remember of our contacts but

116
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:24,039
I should be checked with John remember the committee was Rob Phillips and some others who

117
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:32,920
may can't remember now but anyway this went on and this time Pauling agreed this is what would

118
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,279
transpire but he wanted also the homes papers to come as well he strongly felt always

119
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,439
like that after he had won the peace prize that she should have shared in it because he was the

120
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:56,120
one that actually stimulated his activity in that area well there was a huge when he agreed to do

121
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,000
this the first thing that he did was supply to the university and you'll know all this in the

122
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:09,559
records of of the special collections he sent the copies of the signatories to the

123
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,559
proposal for the way of holding the petition for banning

124
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,360
exploding explosion of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere atmospheric test bands

125
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,480
and that was the first thing I believe that came to Oregon State and only gradually to the other

126
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,839
materials that appear still because of course when I was Pauling was acting until shortly before

127
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:47,480
this was a short time before he was down and I remember people here were not

128
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:58,120
clear about how big this collection of Pauling was and so the Duke course of university suggested

129
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:11,879
that they come down and take a look at what he had and Christian and earthy was sent down

130
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,840
and he came back and told me I had kind of crosses where his eyes should be says there were over

131
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:26,120
90 filing cases down that big surre we're Pauling had his ranch you see all the stuff had been

132
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,720
moved down there and he said Christian I think was of Lamesh was just totally blown away by all of this

133
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:46,120
they say well in Duke course oh after Pauling had agreed to give his papers there was a very

134
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:57,639
very elegant reception in Portland with several speakers and lavish dinner I was really a very

135
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:09,480
very nice affair and Pauling spoke and at that stage somehow the question came up about

136
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:22,519
all of his materials coming here and there had been some feelings some of the family member

137
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,920
particularly Linda I think who felt that the family should have held control over some of these

138
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,039
and Pauling was asked well what does your family think about all this and he says well Linda's

139
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,039
here why don't you ask her I don't remember what a response was what I do remember Pauling statement

140
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:53,639
very clearly well as time went on these things began to arrive these filing cases now remember

141
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,639
well much describing to me a truck had pulled up and discord your few of these filing cases and so on

142
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:10,519
and that was a start and that saw the project through to completion I don't know when the last

143
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,240
of these materials actually arrived here special collections but that's kind of the history

144
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:23,240
of how they came here at least of the role that I played in it doing nothing but reminding one

145
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:31,720
president after another of what Pauling had had what Mrs. Pauling had urged him to do in the

146
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,960
fact that the relations had been repaired seem to between the university and Linus Pauling seem

147
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:47,400
to suggest that things might go smoothly forward from there I do know that he was actually very fond

148
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,560
of the university but he came on business which he did not infrequently I usually

149
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:05,960
somehow involved in escorting him around walking the campus with him and a number of occasions

150
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,800
we walked around campus for one time we walked up in the old who was in those days known as a

151
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:18,519
chem shack and then quite seriously remodeled from Pauling's time but he seemed to be able to

152
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:24,759
pick out the room in which he had been lecturing when they even held on Pauling appeared in his life

153
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,159
and we walked down 15th Street and he showed me a house there that he had lived in as a student

154
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:45,000
and I said to him it's rather surprising because there's a certain parallelism in our experience here

155
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,120
because I lived on 15th Street also only on the other side of the street just to have a

156
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,160
block down and I was an undercrucute student so I took a picture of him in Linda on the steps of the

157
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:09,960
of the house I have it somewhere in my materials at home so the other thing I would say is that

158
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:25,800
when Pauling began to come back to Oregon State on occasion we saw him in his life as long

159
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:33,720
as she was living quite frequently at home for dinner and places and things like that so we got

160
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,680
to know them pretty well better than when I was a student of course when I was a Kel Tech as a student

161
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:47,319
I was a student I was it so it's been for me a wonderful exhilarating experience

162
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:55,319
so does that answer your query I've spent 20 minutes describing it?

163
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:02,279
Yeah well I'm interested in not very giving it a memory of the memories at the time that

164
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,960
maybe on the minus would come up in frequently and you're hosting them?

165
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:21,639
Oh yeah sure I have I have I have I keep thinking that I have said some of this to you before but

166
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:37,080
and they have been to somebody else but let me think just a moment one time this is

167
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,400
in the music anecdote and I don't know whether it involved well but I don't remember the

168
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,520
who the host was for dinner party that the Paulings and we were invited to along with Dave

169
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,400
Schumacher who was chairman of our department and who by the way new Pauling very well he was a

170
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:09,079
student at Kel Tech when I was and we all knew that Pauling he didn't shy away from alcohol he

171
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:20,279
liked the vodka and on the evening of the dinner party and just before about four o'clock I got

172
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:32,759
a call from the host sorry about my throat asking me I know that Dr. Pauling likes vodka says I

173
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,319
looked at my cupboard and I don't have any and I don't have any way of getting it do you happen to

174
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:45,480
have any vodka and I said well as a matter of fact I do have I told this story no well as a matter

175
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,960
of fact I do so I went into my cupboard and I had maybe two thirds of a bottle there and so I

176
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:01,000
got a brown paper bag put the bottle in it and then we were picked up and the Paulings were picked up

177
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:10,200
and we were driven up to the whole south right in the doorbell and he appeared and everybody shook

178
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,880
hands and he and it is why I greeted everyone most pleasant clean as I walked in I handed him my

179
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:26,120
paper bag with a bottle in it and then every minute settled down for a bit in the living room before

180
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,200
dinner was served and the host said well would anybody like a drink and Dr. Pauling said well you

181
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,840
don't happen to have any vodka do you and the host said well as a matter of fact I do

182
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,519
so I thought that was that story I think is very funny and retrospect but

183
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,920
and then he wrote I never told Pauling this history at all

184
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:08,200
so after either Helen died he continued to come to Oregon State often with Linda

185
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,360
as who accompanied him and they would come there were lots of things set up at the university

186
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:23,879
of receptions here there's a big library reception one time and there were seminars and chemistry

187
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:34,439
and even in physics and then usually after these affairs and before dinner well I say usually that

188
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:43,159
often at any rate he and Linda would come to the house and on one occasion

189
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:53,000
referring still now to his enjoyment of a drink before dinner

190
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,319
we were on the campus walking around I said what would you like to do now before the next

191
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,439
reception which is a hour and a half way it says as well can we go to your house for a drink and I

192
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:12,439
said yes we could so we went over to my house and he said you don't happen to have any vodka

193
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:20,840
I thought I know you like that and so I got a glass a small tumbler like it puts a nice in it

194
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:28,039
and he drank a drink straight vodka it's essentially pure alcohol you know and he told me at one

195
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:33,240
other occasion before dinner he always had one of these cocktails but that was about it

196
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,240
so I opened the glass and started to pour and I said say when he didn't say when when the

197
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,960
thing was full I stopped and he looked out and he looked at me with a smile there was a lot of

198
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,359
icing it so we really wasn't an awful lot of vodka I think at any rate we chatted a while and

199
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,880
then he said to me can I have another and Linda was sitting there they had to go this is a time

200
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,920
we had to go to reception over here in the library someplace or another it was a library

201
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,880
reception but it was held in the M U and one of the rooms at the M U and anyway he says can I

202
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:19,000
have another vodka I put some more ice in and poured again and once again I stopped when it was

203
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,480
full and Linda was over there is a daddy daddy you shouldn't do that you've got to go to a

204
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:31,320
reception he just smiled at her and then we got up and walked out and he walked straight as a

205
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:36,599
a lot he didn't waiver at all we got in the car went over there and he walked in and he shook

206
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:42,919
hands with people you couldn't tell and you know he he didn't weigh an awful lot he probably weighed

207
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:52,359
165 pounds or 60 pounds or something he's a tall man and loose-jointed if everybody knows it

208
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,639
and that the reception went off just fine so

209
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,079
at one dinner party we had uh when this appalling was still alive

210
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:11,000
we tried to set it up in a nice fashion we had

211
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,799
another there were the Paulings and Lisa and me and another couple and I had been two more maybe

212
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:29,000
eight people but we had a first course with some white wine and I brought out the bottle and

213
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,399
poured the white wine and the wine has picked up the bottle and he says oh he says yeah this is

214
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:43,480
I can't pronounce this well we say and he says that's the same wine you served us last year

215
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:53,319
which why he would remember of all of the dinner parties it'd been to what wine we had saved him

216
00:26:53,319 --> 00:27:01,960
at the dinner party a year before it beats me but anyway that was his remark it's been great fun

217
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,839
knowing it so does that answer your question about the papers and so on?

218
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:12,359
I want to ask you about the shoemakers we have their questions yes such a question

219
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,319
yeah you have a senior to broad what do you call it on what they're like is this people and that's

220
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:27,079
saying oh well Dave shoemaker and I were close friends and when they we served on a national

221
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:37,799
committee together the United States the American Crystalographic Association has a committee

222
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:47,639
on which well at any rate we had a meeting to which I traveled in Washington DC and Dave

223
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,279
shoemaker was the chairman of this committee well he and I had been students at Caltech and I knew

224
00:27:52,279 --> 00:28:01,720
him very well and at the end before I left we were looking for a replacement for Bert

225
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:11,559
Christensen who was retiring and there was some talk given about bringing in in fact it was

226
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:19,079
preferred to bring in an outside person and I was impressed with how Dave who was on at MIT

227
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:27,079
as professor of chemistry and a crystallographer ran this meeting very efficient I thought she'd be

228
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:35,799
a good chairman and so the meeting was one one under a very very tight schedule we had we worked

229
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,679
furiously for several hours and then people had to disband and they were not having a dinner

230
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,079
they were going to go home so I had almost I said Dave I want to talk to you and he said well

231
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,119
he says you know I got to catch a train it's not so much of time but he says I'm on the way to

232
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:58,599
the restroom let's go to the restroom together well this may sound indelicate and when you

233
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,720
play it back again but there we were on a pair of journals which were at an angle to each other so

234
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,039
we were somewhere facing each other and I outlined this situation to him and asked him if he would

235
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,839
consider think about being considered as department chairman of course Dave grew up and

236
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:24,759
Idaho went to recall it so he loved the West and although MIT was a very prestigious institution

237
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:32,680
and they had a summer house so he had a plara up in the mountains he said yes he would think about

238
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:44,759
it so he came out and people liked him and he was off of the job well one of the conditions for

239
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:52,680
the job from his point of view was that his wife Clara Brink was also a distinguished crystallographer

240
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:59,480
and she wanted to be able to work to have an appointment at that time there was a law in fact

241
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:07,079
and there still exists that came into being during the depression it was an anti-neptism law

242
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:15,640
and it decreed that no members of the same family I don't remember how that was defined

243
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,400
could work in the same department or in fact in the same institution but even further in the

244
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:31,640
state system of higher education except under unusual circumstances well about this time

245
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:39,240
Lisa my wife who was also a scientist we've been working together for years and we had a joint

246
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:47,080
grant together and previous to that she had had appointments and computer centers and associate

247
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:56,199
professor and so on so she was a professional but then it was determined that by a birth

248
00:30:56,199 --> 00:31:04,119
chrysanthemum that he wasn't going to allow her to work any longer and be paid and so I went to

249
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:10,359
him and said look we've got this grant here and then you've signed it on the bottom the line item

250
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:18,839
on the budget and Lisa has to be able to work he says I'm not going to approve it so we took it

251
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,919
over to Vern Schell of them who was being a science at that time and brought it in I showed him

252
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,119
this and he says well why don't you tell me this sooner and I said well birth chrysanthemum he

253
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,879
were very close friends and I said I thought we should be talking to the chain of command here

254
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,960
and he says well he says here's a document it's legal he says she's going to be able to work

255
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,280
on this grant until it expires but after that she's if she wants to continue to be paid she'll have

256
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,960
to be get a grant of her own well all this a privilege a day of coming and one of his conditions

257
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:03,560
as I say was his wife be allowed to work and uh this is heart McVicar came around and uh he

258
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:10,759
looked at this and he says okay he says it says that you cannot have members of the same family

259
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:17,639
working in this institution at the same time and being paid except under unusual circumstances

260
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,519
he says it's clear that a husband and wife scientific came as an unusual circumstance

261
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:29,559
so he says I am going to approve this and then they've said yeah but Ken Hedberg and his wife

262
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,039
are exactly the same situation and Nick Picker says the same rule of applied on them

263
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:42,279
and McVicar said and this is very funny uh here Dave and I are close friends and our wives are friends

264
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:50,919
and McVicar says the only thing I'm going to ask is that you be responsible for decent my wife

265
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,159
and Ken would be responsible for Clara so once a term David called me and there's

266
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,840
officers okay Ken how's Clara doing and we would have a big laugh over and I said fine I said how's

267
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:12,360
the lucid doing fine he says that that's it so that's the history of uh without condition

268
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:22,360
Dave excepted the job and was here uh certain that capacity for several years until he retired and

269
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,959
he and Clara had an office in chemistry about he became ill with kidney disease fun he was on

270
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:38,599
dialysis and died of a heart attack on time during dialysis over an Albany. Clara lived for

271
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:47,000
several years after that and they set up a fund anchored with a hundred thousand dollars to begin

272
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:58,119
with for the support of students in chemistry so that's Dave Schumacher uh Dave and I shared

273
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:05,799
an office at Caltech it's another interesting thing about him I have never been a smoker but he was

274
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,360
and uh I told this story at meetings when people will ask me about Dave I said well you know

275
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,200
he had uh he didn't have an astray because that wouldn't have lasted long he had uh

276
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:30,840
uh France 75 how it's so showcasing which is a brass thing with a rim on the bottom and stood

277
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,440
about two and a half feet high and it had a notch cut on the top and he'd sticky cigarette and that

278
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,880
flip it and the ashes would come down when he left that thing was folded a brim with ashes

279
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:52,519
in my office I threw it out of course but uh he gave up smoking right after that when he went to

280
00:34:52,519 --> 00:35:02,760
MIT and Clara never smoked and she had some respiratory problems asthma and so on in her late

281
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,400
year so that might have been part of the cause they have a distinguished son the bobby Schumacher

282
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:23,320
who went off to Britain and he's an historian and he's at one of the uh southwestern British

283
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:36,519
universities and uh he believe it or not has a position as a professor of English history this is

284
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:46,360
an American he's still an American citizen and he's written uh his thesis was a penetrating book

285
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,000
a penetrating document was published in book form and got uh very very good reviews

286
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,559
so I think that's uh an interesting sideline to the Schumacher's both scientists the son of

287
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:09,160
his historian lecturing on any English history to Brits and being academically rewarded for it

288
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:17,239
but we talked a little bit about your early trips to Norway and your associations with

289
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,839
Norwegian and whether you could talk a little bit more about how that has continued every time you

290
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:27,399
mentioned Norway and Norwegian scientists. Oh well uh let's see I want to make sure that

291
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,519
I'm talking about the things you would want me to uh how I went to Norway and how my relationship

292
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,679
with Norway and Norwegians continued professionally through the years is that?

293
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,440
Yes we talked about the initial shift and uh how about what?

294
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,679
We talked about your initial shift in Norway and meeting you like the Christ and then

295
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,679
yeah uh your early associations with other baskets and then how to hassle

296
00:36:52,280 --> 00:37:00,360
yes well um my professional associations with Norway

297
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:06,760
uh developed as a consequence of knowing professor Opto Walter Walshjohn

298
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,960
the leader became rector of the university I don't remember whether I'd mentioned that or not

299
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:22,200
yeah but uh uh when I was there I spent oh I've lived in Norway probably about five years

300
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:31,000
or so all told uh mostly on one year's stance and by the way Pauling has often come when I've

301
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,359
been there and we've escorted him around Bostjansson and I the various places in in Norway

302
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:49,159
and gone to meetings and talks that he's held and that he held uh at any rate uh at least his

303
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:57,000
family connections uh still you know early years of our marriage were pretty strong and uh she

304
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:07,799
liked to go back to Norway so on my first sabbatical leave uh at Oregon State uh I uh decided

305
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:16,759
I would go back to Norway we had some big projects going on uh that uh we could share Norway

306
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,840
with our Norwegian colleagues and so I spent a year at the University of Losswell then again

307
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:32,120
in sabbatical and Lisa worked also she came in and we had a nice house uh arranged for us by the

308
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:39,400
university actually it's an you know an apartment they don't have houses there by and large

309
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:50,920
uh for younger people so uh during this time I met a number of people that were essentially two

310
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:58,840
laboratories doing my kind of work at the one at the University of Oslo and the other at uh at

311
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,840
the University of Trondheim which didn't have that name at the time

312
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:15,720
and uh one of the uh Lisa got her training in uh Boss Johnson's laboratory and a number of other

313
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:24,360
people did also one of whom was a lady named Maudet Trenthabad who uh went to Trondheim became

314
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,720
professor there and I was invited up there and gave a lecture and she introduced me to a student

315
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:37,399
of hers named Colder and Hagen and Colder and I uh the question was he was just finishing his degree

316
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:43,639
and I was looking for a post-doctoral associate so I said to him out at I said well is he pretty good

317
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:49,799
and he said yes he's very good so Colder and came to the United States that was the beginning of a

318
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:58,519
professional relationship I think that uh probably my strongest professional relationship

319
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,559
apart from that of course it's my wife and the work that she does in the laboratory

320
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,199
of anyone and he has spent a total of six years in Kodala's coming at various times for years

321
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:16,360
leave someone once twice uh two-year leave and so on and uh

322
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,800
Sorry, Ben, how did he start his name? Just an actual year?

323
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,000
Hagen, H-H-H-E-M and the person in his cold urine uh

324
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:32,920
uh Björn is uh it's KOL and then BJ umlaut at O-R-M that means bear in the region

325
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,639
so anyway uh this relationship uh went on through the years and then one time

326
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:50,119
uh I received an invitation uh oh I was asked several times to serve on uh doctoral committees

327
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:58,920
and one of them was uh modest committee when she obtained her doctorate that was quite early

328
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,239
in my career that that was lots of fun because it's all done very formally you know there's a

329
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,679
first opponent of second opponent and then a third one who's kind of a humorous opponent

330
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:13,239
so I was the first opponent and in these formal things you're dressed very

331
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,920
formally on the old days used to wear tuxedos the candidate would wear a some hand would wear a

332
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
tuxedo but we had a podium and the candidate was over here

333
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
bought it and I was here and there was an auditorium full of people and I'd been given her thesis and

334
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,240
I would ask her questions and she would answer and so on and uh at the end by the way I was paid

335
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:45,159
a substantial amount of money for this and that was a norm for the time so we had a tremendous

336
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:52,679
tradition is that the successful candidate throws a party and we had a wonderful absolutely wonderful

337
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:59,079
dinner party at her house that's not formed an association that uh continued until her death

338
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:07,239
years later but she's been time and time and time is also at any rate so uh after uh in my mid-career

339
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:17,079
and uh colligerent group and inform me that the university had elected uh elected to give me an

340
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:28,279
honorary degree so I could come up there and uh and that was a tremendous fun also uh there were

341
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,479
three of us who won uh who were awarded an honorary degree and one of the guys was a

342
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:43,400
fellow from uh Germany who uh had just won the Nobel Prize so I felt myself in distinguished

343
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:53,000
companies and uh there was a big party I still think of that great funness and then uh I think

344
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,880
sometime before this I was elected to membership in uh an origin academy of sciences

345
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:07,960
and a bit later on another occasion a few years later these are the American Equivalents

346
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:18,519
uh the actual Norwegian name is uh uh well I don't have to describe it but anyway let's say

347
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:26,280
one of them's uh the Norwegian uh counter-part of uh uh national academy of sciences here and the

348
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,040
other one is uh Norwegian counter-part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and I've been

349
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,519
asked uh been awarded a membership in each one of these so all of this is a consequence of this

350
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:46,360
long stretch of uh professional affiliation I've had with people in Norway I think the

351
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,360
laboratory that does my kind of work in Oslo is now extinct and the one in the Trondheim is also

352
00:43:54,519 --> 00:44:02,840
everybody who is involved in my day just as I am or is retired and so the university

353
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,320
efforts have gone off in different directions but everyone that belongs to this laboratory

354
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,880
almost every single person in Oslo I think barring one has been sometime in my laboratory

355
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:25,240
and almost everyone in Trondheim has also spent time in my laboratory so there's a

356
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:36,119
that number so oh maybe 10 or 15 people all together who spent as long as uh two years

357
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,440
in my laboratory I have a book in my office in which I formed the early habit of taking a

358
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,480
a photo of a picture and pasting the book and asking them to sign the name to it and all of these people

359
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:59,400
are there and on one occasion when I was in uh going to go to Norway I was asked if I would give a

360
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,559
talk in Trondheim and I said yes and I got to thinking about this so Kodrenhagen by this time

361
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:11,559
they've become a professor in Trondheim so I fished out all the pictures that I had and arranged

362
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,920
them in sequence from the time he first came the time he last came they're about eight of them

363
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:24,920
and I had a series of uh slides made of this when I came to talk I said I want to show you the

364
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:32,599
history of one of our good friends and so I put these up there and to the immense hilarity of the

365
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:38,039
audience because they'd never seen Hagen as a young man they'd only seen it and I could show

366
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:44,360
his development with dates underneath it well that made quite a hit in that talk he's never

367
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:52,599
let me forget about that even so it's it's been a great uh boon and fun for me

368
00:45:55,239 --> 00:46:02,199
so I have also formed uh professional attachments and friends with people at the

369
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:08,199
University of Trond so which is in the Northern Norway and uh the University of Oregon I don't know

370
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:20,279
what's closed so it's it's been a very fun thing for me I think there was a name of people from

371
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:27,319
the OASU chemistry department over the years I'm wondering if you could share any recollections

372
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:36,440
about some of these folks uh John Fulton John Fulton is the only one that I never met in person

373
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:45,480
when I came to Oregon state in 1939 Gilbert was chair and I don't know how long he had been

374
00:46:45,880 --> 00:47:00,199
at that point but he certainly was still chairman in uh 1956 my return and I think he actually

375
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:10,519
retired in from the chairmanship in 1957 wanting to spend the last truthy years of his life as uh

376
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:15,000
doing teaching and research again that's when Christensen succeeded in

377
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:26,920
so I uh every I don't know the Christwere you've seen all the pictures and chemistry have you

378
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,759
if you go into the main hall of Gilbert Hall on the end nearest here the library

379
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:43,320
and walk down on the left-hand side high up is a chronological arrangement of all professors

380
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:54,360
that have been present at this uh in that department and retired John Fulton is the first one in the

381
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:02,120
list every single person I have known of a succeeding 20 or 30 that go on down the hall

382
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:10,199
uh uh of course the last uh I've been retired long enough so I'm quite a long ways from the end now

383
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
but everybody on up to the present I've known them all except Fulton that's the kind of we good that

384
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:27,159
how about uh thanks for uh Gophelin sorry thanks for uh Gophelin Gophelin oh yes yeah uh he

385
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:36,519
he he he he didn't have an active uh uh role in the chemistry department he was Dean in the

386
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:44,279
College of Science and during the war for a short time he was uh acting president of the university

387
00:48:44,279 --> 00:48:54,679
if I remember this correctly but he was a very erudite man and a wonderful personality

388
00:48:55,319 --> 00:49:02,599
uh I didn't know him well I met him on a number of occasions and he was still alive

389
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:10,759
uh when I returned to the university but he suffered from I don't remember whether it was Parkinson's

390
00:49:10,759 --> 00:49:17,079
or oh I think it was all some of the species that he finally succumbed to it but he was just a

391
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:28,039
wonderful guy his family has set up a uh research award and his name called the Gophelin Applies

392
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:36,119
and that's given every year to uh a faculty member

393
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,440
uh Earl Gilbert

394
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:49,880
Earl Gilbert uh the hall was not named Gilbert Hall until after he died because there was at that time

395
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:58,119
a rule against uh naming buildings after living people uh Gilbert was a a big guy

396
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:08,920
uh he walked with a kind of a shuffle he was a physical chemist he had two sons Henry and Allen

397
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:21,400
and Henry was a classmate of mine as an undergraduate and in the war broke out he was uh involved in

398
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:28,599
war work or over in Albany at the I don't know there was a bureau of mines in or whether he was

399
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:39,320
working with watching or whatever on war work but he died of uh of um a legacy

400
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:49,800
people think it was uh related to ingestion or inhalation of burilia which was extremely toxic

401
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:58,680
his son Allen Gilbert I mean his brother Allen Gilbert Earl Gilbert's son was a surgeon at the

402
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:08,519
Colales clinic for many years he retired uh as I understand it because he developed severe arthritis

403
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:18,440
in his hands uh he was a very nice guy well Gilbert uh I had only one course from him when I was an

404
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:27,400
undergraduate uh the department chairman actually taught them and he uh taught physical chemistry

405
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:42,840
I recall one kind of plundent experience with Earl Gilbert when I was an undergraduate

406
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:51,960
there was a chemistry honor society called Philan de Uppsalon and I was elected membership in this

407
00:51:51,960 --> 00:52:03,240
and Henry Gilbert who was a chemistry major was not now Henry Gilbert was uh I want to say

408
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,360
a very outspoken outgoing guy and uh

409
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,559
he was not elected to when you're elected to membership of voters taken and if there is any I

410
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:29,240
don't recall what the circumstances of the election what the rules are or work at that time

411
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,039
but he was not elected and Earl Gilbert his father was very upset at this

412
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:47,159
and uh he called me into his office and he says I cannot ask you who uh he in a very

413
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:51,800
different way let me know he was very disappointed that Henry had not been elected

414
00:52:53,239 --> 00:53:04,039
at that time the chemistry uh the Philan de Uppsalon had members comprising majors in chemistry

415
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:14,279
and chemical engineers largely and he says I can't ask you of course uh about the vote but he said

416
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:22,840
can you tell me this I suspect was it mostly the engineers that were involved in this negative vote

417
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,000
and I hesitated a long time and I said well you know I felt I had the answer and

418
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:35,719
and I said yes it was and he he he just shrugged his shoulders I know he deplored it

419
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:45,320
there was a strong greek community on the campus at the time that I was here

420
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,679
there was kind of a social division between the independence and the Greeks

421
00:53:51,559 --> 00:54:04,039
and uh that uh division seemed to extend into honor societies as well people were voted for

422
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:11,719
membership and you know it's uh in retrospect it's utterly ridiculous to think that somebody who

423
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:19,879
is academically well qualified would be not voted into an organization for personality reasons

424
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,359
I like Henry Gilbert we got along just fine and he didn't have the shy respectful

425
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:30,199
attitude that maybe these people expected he should have but

426
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:36,359
that was very upsetting to Earl Gilbert another thing about the Gilbert's

427
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:43,639
uh once a year they invited the chemistry department to dinner at their house

428
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:50,119
but there's the faculty and other spouses and there was always a very nice dinner

429
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,079
now the Gilbert's were T-totalers no alcohol was served

430
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:04,839
to managers was served instead and that was all all well and good everybody understood this

431
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,359
then the Gilbert's went off uh I think uh

432
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:19,480
it may have been one summer they took a trip to France and they came back and uh

433
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,880
Wendell Sleibal a good friend of mine was hosting a dinner party and he asked uh

434
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,640
Elise and I were asked were invited as were the Gilbert's and some other people in physical chemistry

435
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:39,159
and uh it was a very nice dinner and Wendell asked me ahead of time he says do you think I should

436
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:50,519
uh offer people uh uh uh Sherry or uh a drink or wine with dinner and I said well it's your party

437
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:57,719
why not and the Gilbert's as I say I just come back from this trip in France so Wendell and Duke

438
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:02,919
of course asked everybody what they're in the pur and Earl Gilbert says well I'll have a

439
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:13,239
class of tomato juice and uh his wife said I think I'd like some Sherry

440
00:56:15,879 --> 00:56:25,159
Gilbert wins and she had a glass of Sherry on the conversation and she said my that was nice

441
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:31,879
Sherry I like that very much and Gilbert modeled and I like my tomato juice too

442
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:42,599
I understood that uh I don't worry where I got this information but I understood that as they

443
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,679
travel through France they did drink wine because that's about the only thing that

444
00:56:47,399 --> 00:56:55,000
you would be served at a meal and maybe that's uh how Mrs Gilbert just for the moment I

445
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:04,599
can't remember her name but it'll come to me uh they were nice people I like them

446
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:14,920
well the next first time I was in Wendell's label uh Wendell was a remarkable person

447
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:22,519
uh I held him in the highest regard not when I first came but later on

448
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:35,320
he uh well I first came did I mention that there was uh I mentioned that Christensen became

449
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:41,320
chairman after Gilbert but that was not without a hitch in the proceedings have I ever mentioned that

450
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,840
well for some god forsaken reason it was determined that the department should

451
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:55,320
uh not only elect which was so reasonable enough that should vote for who they would prefer as a

452
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:59,640
department chairman of course that was non-binding because the dean is the one that makes a decision

453
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:07,880
but one other thing for some reason it was nobody seems to remember this but me I'll have to dig out my

454
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:16,039
records the department decided it was going to have a constitution democracy was going to rule

455
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:21,719
now if you think about that how ridiculous can you imagine you can't run a department

456
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,279
has a democracy with a legislative that determines things you got to have a department chairman

457
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:36,599
of makes things happen these others at may slave all ran for uh he came around and I was new

458
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:44,519
at this time long a Tom Parsons and uh I knew that he was a candidate he came around and uh

459
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:56,119
and very subtle way was discussing this and uh chrisensen was the era parent as I explained uh

460
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:01,880
Berncello then was the dean and they were good friends and everybody expected that chrisensen as they

461
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:09,639
as the oldest and most experienced and long served longest serving department member

462
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:16,119
would become chairman he was a good scientist he did hard work and he's one of the few people who were

463
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:21,960
regularly publishing at Oregon State at that time well slave all was running also

464
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:31,400
and uh it was determined that uh the person who won the elections name would uh go forward

465
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:40,119
now I don't remember whether slave all won this election I don't know how many votes were cast

466
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,200
maybe 20 all told at 30 won the election by one vote

467
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,760
and all hell broke loose you know uh chrisensen was terribly upset so

468
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:09,640
and uh at slave all told me later he was invited uh over to uh a dean's office I don't know

469
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:16,120
whether it was show them and there's someone else and sat down and talked to in a friendly manner

470
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,720
by this official to point it out that he was a young man and that uh

471
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:33,480
uh the department would undoubtedly uh run better if somebody with long experience was chairman

472
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:37,879
and as a young man he would have plenty of chances to rise through the

473
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:46,519
uh hierarchy into administrative position and slave all reading the handwriting on the wall just

474
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:53,559
uh then announced that he was withdrawing his name from consideration that was his public statement

475
01:00:53,559 --> 01:01:02,759
but his private feelings I have relayed to you so chrisensen became chairman and uh I think he

476
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:13,719
always had that uh uh what do I want to call it feeling of having been rejected hanging over him

477
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:20,839
for a long time so he stole very hard to be what he thought would be a good chairman and I could

478
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:28,679
tell you about that also but slave all was a distinguished teacher his lectures were very popular

479
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:39,480
and he had a most original mind uh he uh he did unusual things he built himself uh

480
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:50,119
was rare at that time a three-wheeled bicycle with uh enclosed in uh uh a canopy over the top which

481
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:56,119
had uh plastic windows in front so he was shielded from the wind and he would pedal this thing to

482
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:01,159
work and add a little flag up the back just as if you see some of the handicapped people using

483
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:07,639
these today not him he had this later on he built something similar and he put a motor on it

484
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:16,199
it was electric motor and operated by a battery he billed all himself he lived on uh on grants

485
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:30,199
street uh up about uh 34th street on the right hand side and he had hedges there

486
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:38,599
and he trimmed these hedges so what is the art farm known when you cut these in the form of shapes

487
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:46,279
and animals he meticulously groomed these plants and he had one sitting there that had wheels on it

488
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:53,239
an canopy and a steering wheel just one bush that had been sculpted into that shape others he

489
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:59,639
sculpted into animal shapes and then in his driveway which slipped down to the street he painted

490
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:11,399
one of the very famous uh uh what's the guy's name who does these peculiar drawings uh

491
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,559
they're famous now he's a famous artist the water that runs up hill without seeming to do so

492
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:27,079
it's the assure yes sure yeah yes sure he painted the the black and white doves that you know

493
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:33,960
mesh together not going down to the sidewalk he billed outside a bench into the wall

494
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:41,000
his yard sloped down to a concrete area there and he billed a bench in there a wood

495
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:47,960
and it says uh I don't remember the Italian words exactly or the pronunciation but say it

496
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:56,759
it's in a sense it's something commoto de publico for the convenience of the public you see

497
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:06,759
uh we got to know him and his wife uh very well uh later on we saw them socially a good deal

498
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:17,719
and uh Lewis his wife was a very nice lady uh Wendell uh he had this nice house

499
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:25,400
he had an idea he went down to the GT one time and he bought or brought I think he was

500
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:32,519
they were given to him a number of plates which were used in printing which were all black on

501
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:39,320
the top they were uh perhaps a glass or something I don't know but he bought a whole bunch of these

502
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,599
and he billed himself a box on his roof and he amounted these things so the sun would hit it

503
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:49,800
and he slowly circulated air through this which he then arranged to be pumped down into his house

504
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:58,519
and uh you still have to have a furnace of course but he said this uh noticeably reduced his

505
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:05,000
heating costs then and later years he would quit early and he says I need some exercising we'd go

506
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:13,400
home and I discovered he was digging a huge sister in his yard and uh I saw this thing being

507
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,200
constructed and he had grape lines in back too wasn't a big yard but he had grape lines as well

508
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:23,719
and when this was completed you know we were up there a dinner one time she's come and see my

509
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:29,159
sister and it was just completed and I looked down and this down thing it was about eight feet

510
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:34,599
across and it was at least eight feet tall it was a huge thing and he dug it all by hand

511
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:44,439
made the lining and everything and it's concreted it all up and so on and he said uh there it is

512
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,280
he says he's going to start filling it he says let's go down and he had a ladder built on the

513
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,960
side so we went down we sat down on a couple chairs in the bottom while he described this sister

514
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:01,800
into me so then we went upstairs and he covered it and he piped all the water that fell on his roof

515
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:07,720
all of that went into the sister which he then pumped out to water he's carton the front

516
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:20,839
and the vines and back everything and then the city then had a uh an assessment for storm for drainage

517
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,199
so he went down to the city and said he wanted to have his drainage reduced because the property

518
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:31,239
was not as big as they said it was and he gave him an estimate of the square footage of the

519
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:37,079
roof on his house and he wanted a proportional reduction in his drainage sheet the city would have

520
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:44,599
no nothing to do with this at which point he realized that this uh drainage was really a tax

521
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,880
on the amount of land that you had not really um it's disguised the way he put it to me

522
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:54,920
so that was Wendell

523
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:06,920
he died of a heart attack in his uh sleep and uh it was tragic thing lowest was very upset

524
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:15,480
and uh she continued to live in the house for quite a while and uh she would come to our house regularly

525
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:23,319
and we would go up there to dinner and uh she came to us for dinner and uh I did some work

526
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:29,719
a little work in our house for I repaired the toilet that was leaking around the seam at the

527
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:35,880
bottom put a new boat boot in it and I drilled a hole in the door and put one of these viewports in

528
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:44,599
it for did a few things like that and she developed an infection that uh by the time it was diagnosed

529
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:52,760
her uh condition was so poor that she even had to treatment uh she couldn't recover and she

530
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:59,480
eventually died from it not the infection but uh fact that uh she had no reserves left

531
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:10,199
so I was uh that's the story of the labels as I know they had one son who uh is in California

532
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:18,199
still he has no children and he is an orthopedic surgeon he had a daughter named Jane

533
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:26,600
who babysat our kids when they were small and uh she became for reasons that were never entirely

534
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:35,240
clear to me as strange from her mother and uh she lives in Seattle she was married and then divorced

535
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,560
and I think I've seen her once up there but I don't know what's become of her since then

536
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,520
that's about what I know of this label is you mentioned very Christmas in there uh

537
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:54,120
good to come and share oh yes well Bert very much wanted people to realize uh for the

538
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,159
convinced people he was a very good department chairman and we have in the chemistry department

539
01:08:59,159 --> 01:09:06,519
at that time we have a source of chemicals uh let's call it a storeroom uh there's a lot of

540
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:11,559
chemicals used and at that time an organic chemistry and so on there's a big supply in there

541
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:17,640
and uh he would buy these in bulk and they would be repackaged in jars

542
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:25,160
and labeled with a number and so on on them and uh other departments you know they couldn't afford

543
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:33,240
a storeroom like this this would be sold to them at the price that was less or maybe just a

544
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:41,480
trifle less of the price listed for the same size container of the same material in the drug

545
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:48,119
and uh chemicals catalog and by buying it both and repackaging it we saved money

546
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:57,399
he made money and that money was used to support uh various things yet to realize on those days

547
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:04,359
there was almost no money for anything if you wanted to replace the equipment you know it was uh

548
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:11,079
like pulling teats to get any money from the university for that and this uh enabled things to

549
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:22,119
proceed uh in the department and to keep us just at least hanging on the trouble with this was

550
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:33,000
that this money which went into account had to be spent by the 30th of June and uh sometimes

551
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:38,759
Christmas was very frugal he would get all this stuff uh piled up there and then

552
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,600
he didn't have a way of spending it before the end so all sorts of peculiar things happened

553
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,000
he came down to me one time says Ken how'd you like to have your office painted

554
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,440
and I said my office painted I don't need my office painted and he says well you know it looks

555
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:00,760
little dingy in here we should paint a few of these offices and I just shrugged and so my office

556
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:07,720
was painted and that used up some of the money on another occasion he uh was walking down the

557
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,960
hall in the basement he says you know I don't like the look of all these pipes overhead this

558
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,680
in the basement everything was open all sorts of vents and pipes it looked terrible

559
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:23,880
he says I think uh well how would you how would you react to the idea that we put a false ceiling

560
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,640
in a masculine stuff I said well can do it if you want I don't see the need for it

561
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,680
and the fact uh it improves the appearance of things but it also makes it

562
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:41,560
uh substantially more difficult to locate the source of problems so a new course we have

563
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,800
that false ceiling which if you go into the basement of Gilbert you can see it's still there it's

564
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:54,360
got holes punched in it's white panels suspended from the ceiling and uh so uh

565
01:11:55,319 --> 01:12:06,519
Burke was very very conscious of uh how I want to say he seemed to be covering his tracks all the time

566
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:13,880
and one of the reasons that he refused to renew my wife's appointment had nothing at all to do with

567
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:23,319
science anything like that she was paid very modestly on any event but for the first time in history

568
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:32,199
just before he took this action the city of Corvallis defeated a bond measure designed to support schools

569
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:41,159
and he thought why people are looking at what the education system is doing and here they're

570
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:46,359
going to see if there's a faculty member's wife who's being paid on a faculty member

571
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:52,359
being paid through the system of course my grants were to the university and they were paid

572
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:59,079
and he decided he couldn't tolerate the possibility of somebody objecting to this

573
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:09,479
and that was the reason that he advanced uh to me he says we have to be very careful of our image

574
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,920
he advanced to Lisa I didn't have any do with it she wrote him a letter went to see him

575
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,399
wrote him another letter and nothing had finally refused to answer her letters and that's when we

576
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:30,199
went over to the dean but I remember a remark or old Gilbert said one time he he was a gruffle guy

577
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:36,679
and he spoke down like he says he says Kristen he says bird is sort of like a country horse he

578
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:52,520
shies at a paper in the road so that's bird he uh contributed uh after he retired you know he

579
01:13:52,520 --> 01:14:00,680
sent up a fund designed to help graduate students attend meetings when they were working in research

580
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:09,000
with research groups for which there was no money and that was used quite a lot and I uh thank

581
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,960
him a couple of times when I saw him on the streets and he says oh well I'm pleased he says

582
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:19,480
if he need more money let me know and I don't know whether he put more money up or not I was not

583
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:22,679
the department gentlemen so yeah these good sides

584
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:34,199
so that's a brilliant gentleman uh I don't remember much about

585
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:44,359
earn uh on uh on the same uh personal or intimate basis that I've mentioned these other people

586
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:50,359
because he was sitting in the dean's office at the time well when I first came here he was sort

587
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:58,679
of something he was out of something called the research institute and it turned out in the early

588
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:07,239
days there was a group of biochemists associated with chemistry among who uh who was uh uh

589
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:15,319
Shella and he decided that he would like to set up this independent entity

590
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,319
there are lots of reasons for it because uh overhead that was returned to these

591
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:28,679
uh agencies that that time the university returned part of the overhead to the departments

592
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:33,319
and the departments then could determine how they were going to use this returned overhead

593
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:42,279
well I think Vern had some ambitions that uh clearly he did he was a nice guy by the way

594
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:52,279
he arranged I'm sure with the support of uh chris and son to take these biochemists and to set

595
01:15:52,279 --> 01:16:00,759
up what they called the science research institute which was largely biochemistry and then later on

596
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:14,600
that became uh I think uh kind of morphed into uh along the perhaps other departments I'm not

597
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:21,640
quite sure and what the department about chemistry and bio physics and then uh Vern became department

598
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:30,920
department became D pardon me he suffered from health problems serious ones he had uh very high

599
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:40,840
blood pressure at one stage and he died really rather young his life was uh very well known also

600
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:48,760
um was it I reigned her name was I reigned shella but I think she served uh

601
01:16:51,239 --> 01:17:00,680
she was certainly involved in local politics and I don't know whether uh shella in middle school

602
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:09,319
is uh they were philanthropic also whether that followed mostly from her work or from them jointly

603
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:17,799
as a couple but at any rate so that's about as much as I know Vern person I'd see him on the street

604
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:24,119
when she can some chattabit and then I had this at least and I had this contact within the occasion

605
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:30,199
of her appointment and that's about all I had to do with him yeah that's my my list is Keralde

606
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:42,119
Keralde Kalk and yeah oh well Carol is a wonderful guy I regard him as one of the certainly one

607
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:49,559
of the better chairmen's that I have experienced here uh Carol had a research program in uh in

608
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:59,800
organic chemistry when I first came and uh he decided he would uh whatever reason I think his

609
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:10,280
research was slowing down that he would run for department chairman and uh I think that there

610
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:20,279
were two choices one of them was uh Dara Thomas and the other was Carol and I think the ultimate

611
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:28,599
decision was made by the dean that it would be Dara Thomas and after he served for a term Carol

612
01:18:28,599 --> 01:18:40,039
became department chairman now Carol he really ran the department the way that a lot of

613
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:46,199
us would like to see it done he once professed to me he says look he says my research days are over

614
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:55,800
I view my role in this department as to expedite the research and teaching potential of the department

615
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:07,560
to the maximum possible and so he was know the difference between him and uh Christensen say to

616
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:15,640
choose an example Christensen you couldn't pry a dime out of him uh until the end when you saw

617
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:21,880
this flamboyant expenditures being made I'd go to Carol and I'd say look I need some money from my

618
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:28,280
returned overhead by the way in those days the department received returned overhead from the

619
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:34,680
university maybe they still do I don't know but the department to determine how what they did with

620
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:42,200
the overhead and our department had a practice of returning about 80% of the overhead that was

621
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:49,960
derived from the research grant of an individual to that individual so if you had a big research

622
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:57,560
grant of which a law of overhead was extracted returned with the department then you would have

623
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:04,119
a chunk of money to deal with because I think they returned 80% or so and you could use that

624
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:12,199
anyway you want now what happened was that a notice would be sent about that returned overhead was

625
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:20,359
now available and you should write down what your needs are now it wasn't that the overhead was

626
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:28,119
directed specifically to the individual who had earned it but that would receive some priority

627
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:34,199
but a lot of us didn't need all of our overhead and so we built up formally speaking an account

628
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:42,680
other people who needed equipment that exceeded the returned overhead could use the returned overhead

629
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:48,199
and then that you would have a credit so to speak well of course it's not a business and uh

630
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:57,159
so looking back a perspicacious individual would have seen that this can't persist and the guys who

631
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,199
have the credits are probably never going to realize there are money back again

632
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:07,079
whereas those guys who are in debt you know the department's going to decide they're not going to

633
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:13,639
distribute overhead anymore and so they come out and smell like a rose well I didn't need all of my

634
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:20,760
money uh because I was I had equipment budgets and I could buy an equipment apparatus that I needed

635
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:28,440
but Carol when I went to him on a couple of occasions saying I need this or I need that Carol and I

636
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:35,560
don't have the money in my budget for it uh he says how much is it I'd tell him he's he'd look

637
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:45,720
at this and he'd say okay go ahead buy it and uh he was very effective in this way and I think

638
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,560
people respected him for that because people didn't go to him to try to buy things that really

639
01:21:51,560 --> 01:22:01,079
didn't need and this wasn't keeping with his uh professed remark to me as remarked to me that he

640
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:07,400
was going to do what he could to expedite the teaching and research activities of the department

641
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:11,560
of if you needed money for your research and you didn't have it he tried to get it for you

642
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:20,920
so he was very good uh you know he's still around he does we have an old man's lunch once a month

643
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:33,720
did you know that the old man's lunch started way way back in 1986 and it started with

644
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:42,119
bus marvel Elliott Marvel the professor of organic chemistry who retired and uh

645
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:50,039
Jack Dichius and it may have been Harry Frand also they decided they would meet for lunch

646
01:22:51,720 --> 01:23:00,840
and then there were probably four of them all told and then when I retired they decided that I

647
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:07,239
would be invited for this and then it became a kind of a monthly affair and as people have retired

648
01:23:07,239 --> 01:23:18,199
that uh has kept going so every retiree in chemistry uh and uh two or three in biochemistry

649
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:21,800
and bio physics Chris Matthews comes can then hold as a part of it

650
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,400
uh

651
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:32,360
Bob Becker comes then several chemists come several chemists who could come don't because their active tennis

652
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:38,520
player is still and they have matches Wednesday uh at noon when uh we have our meetings once a month

653
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,000
but I go regularly

654
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,960
and uh so Carol the cop comes

655
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:56,600
and he's a very lively guy it's uh lots of fun to see him he's been very active he bought a house

656
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:06,680
out on the area road he's been an active kayaker for years and uh finally he decided that the commute

657
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:13,159
for him and his wife was just too much so they sold that property at least in the process of

658
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:18,519
selling it and bought some last year here in town where he's now living but he's still kayaks

659
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:25,159
in fact they went down the road recently and he's been down the Grand Canyon more than once in

660
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:31,239
his own kayak so he's very active physically wonderful guy

661
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:40,760
what are some of the more group-ball group-ball memorable of things you can think about in 10 years

662
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,119
working with graduate students?

663
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,119
memorable experiences working with graduate students well

664
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,720
I'm thinking here as I'm sitting

665
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:07,000
I've had some very good graduate students and some that were not so good

666
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:13,239
but almost all of whom have uh finished and gotten a degree

667
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,279
let me name one who came along fairly late his name was Jin Fan Huang

668
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:31,000
and he was a Chinese national and he came here when oh I'd have to look to see but it's been

669
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:41,479
almost 20 years now oh perhaps even more than that from China when it was still a highly

670
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:49,479
restricted place and he grew up in the time of the cultural revolution and by his own boots

671
01:25:49,559 --> 01:26:07,479
dropped, lifted himself up and he became aware of a position I had and I don't remember the details

672
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:14,599
but I decided he would be a good addition and I think he was coming at the beginning with his

673
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:27,720
own money so he arrived and I had several students working with me at that time and one of these was

674
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:39,240
a young woman that was working away when he showed up and I happened to be away the day he arrived

675
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:47,719
he came into the laboratory this young woman was trying to do some work on her computer

676
01:26:48,679 --> 01:27:00,279
and he spoke a rather poor English at this time but he was as gong-ho as they could come

677
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:08,519
and after a while I think today or two later this girl came to me and said I can't stand this

678
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:14,120
guy she says over my shoulder all the time that's me all sorts of questions he was so eager

679
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:24,200
well by this time I was taking him in hand myself and he was beginning to enroll in courses

680
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:34,600
and he was a very anxious to start research and he was dynamic he was a tremendous researcher

681
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:46,840
and he was an older man and he had had a lot of work in chemistry even at the theoretical

682
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:53,160
that was very knowledgeable but he was required to fulfill our department requirements of course

683
01:27:53,160 --> 01:28:03,240
for coursework and he enrolled in theoretical chemistry and he got straight A's no question about

684
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:09,399
at the end of his first year he was voted the outstanding incoming graduate student

685
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,159
and then a year later he was voted the outstanding graduate student and each of these carried

686
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:22,679
financial stipends not a great deal but some and one day he came to me and said

687
01:28:24,119 --> 01:28:32,760
you know the Chinese are very cognizant of let's say I have a social hierarchy and the

688
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:41,560
deference which should be paid to people who occupy a status a little more elevated than yours

689
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:47,960
and so he came to me having just attended lecture and quantum mechanics by one of our

690
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:56,760
our faculty members and he said to me very quietly he said is it all right to correct a professor

691
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:10,280
when he's wrong and I said yes it is you should tell him or raise the issue and tell him about it

692
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:18,760
and say that you think this is the right answer but I'm not quite sure that he ever followed

693
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:26,680
through on that well he did a lot of work and then at the end of his graduation he got his degree

694
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:36,119
he worked for a while with dog Kessler in chemistry and then a colleague of mine at Michigan named

695
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:42,920
Larry Bartel was looking for somebody and I recommended Jim Van Wong to him and of course he shows

696
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:49,079
up and Larry isn't doing quite the same kind of work that I am and Larry has a very abrasive

697
01:29:49,399 --> 01:30:00,039
no nonsense personality but I think he met his match in Jim Van Wong because he would tell

698
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:04,439
a long to do something and a long would do it but then he would point out he could do it better

699
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:13,559
this way and he would do it that way so it turns out that now one was married and he could hardly

700
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:20,280
wait to get his wife to come to this country and finally he arranged so that she could come

701
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:29,400
and they had two children two boys which is of course out of the line there

702
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:36,280
had any rate the first thing that the woman came he wanted her here so she could cook and he could

703
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:42,039
spend more time doing research and he enrolled his son in the high school his elder son

704
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:50,200
I guess both kids but I don't remember so much about the younger anyway he was very distressed

705
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:55,560
because after a while the younger son was not washing home after school and spending the

706
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:01,320
rest of the afternoon studying the son became quite used to American manners and he liked the

707
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:08,360
social life and so on and this distressed his father immensely expected him to behave like a Chinese

708
01:31:09,159 --> 01:31:14,920
so he came to me with this problem and I said Jim Van said how's your son doing well he could

709
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,759
do better he could come home and he could be studying advanced things and I said well how are his

710
01:31:20,759 --> 01:31:26,119
grades he said what grades I said well what are the marks he gets the courses he says well he gets

711
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:34,039
all these so it wasn't an upper Jim Van that his kid was excelling by Americans standards he had

712
01:31:34,039 --> 01:31:40,920
to study all of these better times you see well the things went on his wife had to go home

713
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:51,239
or V6 fired and then he learned after she'd been home a long time that she was pregnant

714
01:31:53,479 --> 01:32:03,079
at which time he immediately divorced her that's a no no there you see and I think I don't know

715
01:32:03,079 --> 01:32:08,039
whether his sons had gone back or whether they stayed with him here or not I just don't remember that

716
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:20,119
but then he began to look for a new wife and this is kind of a mail order proposition

717
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:26,279
and so I don't know how the Chinese do it traditionally but at any rate he found some woman

718
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:35,079
in Shanghai and he went to visit her and I think they eventually married and she's a little more

719
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:43,079
modern type than he was and she joined even Minnesota and I think they're still there I don't know

720
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:49,800
whether they have any children together or not but he found a job in an industry and an

721
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:58,760
arbor but he still works weekends in Larry Bartell's laboratory so he's the most notable

722
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:05,800
graduate student from several points of view that I've had I've had postdocs that are even

723
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:14,039
just as remarkable one from Japan in particular we're getting on here how long do you want to go

724
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:16,920
I can I can go a while longer if you like

725
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:29,319
well let me talk about one of my postdocs I mean I have a host of graduate students and each one of

726
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:36,359
those has got his own personalities and some have been very productive some less productive but

727
01:33:36,839 --> 01:33:43,719
I want to I want to mention something that I think is a remarkable

728
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:53,399
life or a pair of lives there was a distinguished professor named Yoneseo Morino

729
01:33:54,039 --> 01:34:05,719
Morino in Japan at the University of Tokyo and in 1960 I think it was 60 it made in 62

730
01:34:06,519 --> 01:34:12,599
but at any rate I wrote I had a letter or a rote letter I was looking for a postdoc

731
01:34:12,599 --> 01:34:21,960
role appointer pointee and Yoneseo was called Morino we became friends and I've seen him all

732
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:32,199
over the world at meetings and in Norway and other places he wrote to me about his student named

733
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:41,559
Machio Iwasaki who would like to study and he could recommend him well now Machio came to

734
01:34:41,559 --> 01:34:53,559
the United States having gotten his doctorate in Japan and he was phenomenal he was a superb

735
01:34:53,560 --> 01:35:05,800
mathematician an excellent experimentalist he had only rudimentary English but I spoke slowly

736
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:11,400
and he could understand me and I could understand him well it turned out that when he knew he would

737
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:16,280
be coming to the United States in three months he had had no English experience at all

738
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:23,479
he and of course he had essentially no money they don't have money at his graduate students in

739
01:35:23,479 --> 01:35:36,519
Japan at that time and so he went in hawk and enrolled in a crash course in English language

740
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:45,000
and he managed to get enough English so that he could speak to me in English in three months time

741
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:52,679
now that's very it's not so hard for a western speaking person to do that but Japanese is so

742
01:35:52,679 --> 01:36:00,359
different that it's a tour de force he became much better as time went along so he asked me to

743
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:07,319
find a place to live which I did and it was very satisfactory it was very low level but I mean

744
01:36:08,119 --> 01:36:11,719
after all he was here to do research he had his wife with him he had no children

745
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:23,880
and a few weeks later he came to me he said did I know a doctor he said well what's the problem

746
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:32,680
he says my wife has terrible pains in her legs and so on and we better see a doctor and so I

747
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:41,640
gave him the name of a doctor that we had used for our kids and he came to me the next day and he

748
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:49,960
said oh I didn't need the doctor we solved the problem the problem was that never in Japan had this

749
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:57,000
woman been sitting in chairs she had always been in the Japanese traditional position on her

750
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,039
knees and legs with her feet back like this the minute she started to do that all her pains

751
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:08,920
disappeared so she could sit on the chairs intermittently and sooner later the problem vanished

752
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:16,039
another time it came to me and says I need to have vitamins do you know where I can get vitamins

753
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:21,560
I says oh yeah you can find them in any store and he then told me well he didn't mean that kind

754
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:26,600
I said well what kind of vitamins do you mean he says I want like he says I take vitamins but I

755
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:31,800
inject them and I said well people don't inject vitamins there you can take them orally

756
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:42,200
and on another time he came to me and said that well you spent a year then he asked me if he could

757
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:47,560
continue another year and I said yes of course you can't so he worked very hard and then he came

758
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:54,760
to me at that year and he said I've been thinking about another apartment I said and he said I

759
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:04,840
would like to have you join me and look at it so it was over on Western Avenue where he had been

760
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:12,119
living on 11th Street in an old brick building there with apartment building and so this place

761
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:17,000
was lighter and more airy and it seemed to me I'm like a nice place and it was cheaper

762
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:28,279
and he seemed very hesitant about it and he kept looking at me and then sometime later he said

763
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:37,640
you wouldn't lose face if I moved here apparently in his mind because it was cheaper

764
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:45,319
it was a downgrade in quality when matter of fact it was an upgrade in quality but what is

765
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:53,319
remarkable about this is his having been raised in the time maybe it still was where face is

766
01:38:53,319 --> 01:39:02,119
everything well the story is incomplete without my telling you a little bit about his wife who

767
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:08,599
is even more remarkable she couldn't take English she knew no English and she came here

768
01:39:09,079 --> 01:39:17,880
she came from a fairly well off Japanese family very Western whereas Macho's family was very

769
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:24,840
traditional his father was an old sea captain and the daughter-in-law was expected to do everything in

770
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:40,840
the house they lived anyway she did housework for no pay with the stipulation that the person for

771
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:46,680
whom she worked would speak only English to her and try to help her understand the English language

772
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:55,159
and that went on for months and she became conversational in English in a halting way

773
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:03,800
then Macho said after his first year he says now I want to buy a car I want a car

774
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:12,600
so he passed the driver's license test I think he failed it once then passed it both the

775
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:20,200
written so many's wife said she wanted one but she couldn't read English she could only speak it

776
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:25,000
and of course they give you this manual with all the written instruction what the science

777
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,920
made everything she looked at the manual and with his help she memorized everything in the manual

778
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:40,280
she went and took the written exam and got 100% on it without being able to read any words

779
01:40:40,279 --> 01:40:48,599
other than stop and slow and knowing what the science meant the other thing she did earned money

780
01:40:49,399 --> 01:40:55,239
they wanted extra money so she heard herself out when the strawberry season came around to pick

781
01:40:55,239 --> 01:41:02,359
strawberries that was a big thing in those days and she picked strawberries about twice as fast as

782
01:41:02,359 --> 01:41:07,719
anyone else because she knew how to sit on her horses she could go along like a rabbit according

783
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,840
to my undersung she could pick these strawberries and they were paid peaceways for it she made

784
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:22,119
more money than anyone else picking strawberries well they went back to Japan I visited them there

785
01:41:22,119 --> 01:41:26,760
on a most remarkable experience one time but I'll tell you

786
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:39,159
what happened to her they moved in with his parents and she had to play the subservient daughter and

787
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:44,760
when I was there with a friend and revisited them we were invited to the old people's house and they

788
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:52,360
they wore kimonos and as we came in the door we were professors my friend and I

789
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:00,279
and macho was we finished the travel that's another story they were on their knees with their

790
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:10,599
heads down like this because we were professors and we were assured in but modicol the wife of macho

791
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:15,159
did not eat dinner with us she served us she was in the kitchen all the time

792
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:23,880
after the parents died and they took over the house she began to do watercolouring

793
01:42:26,519 --> 01:42:34,760
and as time went on her watercolours became very well known and then finally she became famous

794
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:48,199
when she died some years ago now not many maybe five she was the most talked about watercolour

795
01:42:48,199 --> 01:42:53,800
stone all of Japan their paintings are in museums and she made lots of money from her pain

796
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:01,560
just an utterly remarkable couple I feel very fortunate to have known them

797
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,720
so that's he's the most remarkable postdoctoral person I've had from

798
01:43:13,239 --> 01:43:19,320
these I'm how they're the people of scientifically excellent of course that's not really what I'm

799
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:25,960
talking about but in addition to the scientific excellence that macho had he had all of the other

800
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:33,400
things they saved money while I was here so they could buy an American hot water heater and send it

801
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:41,239
home and install in these parents house so they would have hot water and when I came to visit them

802
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:46,839
they were very worried about the toilet facilities because they only had the traditional thing

803
01:43:46,839 --> 01:43:52,359
were a couple of porcelain raised footprints on a hole in the floor and you had to squat you see

804
01:43:55,479 --> 01:44:00,519
so a remarkable insight into Japanese living

805
01:44:03,799 --> 01:44:09,479
the occasion of this I can tell you this visit to Japan with macho

806
01:44:09,479 --> 01:44:17,239
Autobotsyonson whom I mentioned before and I were in Japan for a meeting and preliminary to that

807
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:24,439
meeting we were asked by a macho or by some other the principal sir would we would you like to do

808
01:44:24,439 --> 01:44:29,559
something ahead of time and I wrote and said yes we would like to like to look around Japan a bit

809
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:35,480
a week ahead of time there was a range that macho had a car now and was employed by an institute

810
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:44,039
and becoming a very well-known scientist would take us around in this car and the one thing I

811
01:44:44,039 --> 01:44:52,120
said to him is that I didn't want to live in any American excuse me or English style accommodations

812
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:58,680
I wanted to see what Japan and particular rural Japan was like so as we traveled around for seven

813
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:05,560
days he had booked ahead of time accommodations and Japanese ends and all the time we were traveling

814
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:15,240
on this trip I never saw another Caucasian in these ends in which we stayed we would come in

815
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:22,039
there would be a doorstep we would be met with a hostess who would bow and give us our kimono

816
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:29,399
you know and take off our shoes we have a usher to our room and some

817
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,920
all snack bits after our travel would come and then a few minutes later the person would come in

818
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:46,760
and say your bath is ready the bath was not a shower it was a huge place this is more or less

819
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:54,440
than norm and there was a huge tub was about four feet deep and it would hold four or five people

820
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:04,280
and it was full of scalding water you see then there away from this tub is a tiled area

821
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,119
with soap along the wall and there's where you wash yourself very thoroughly and rinse yourself

822
01:46:10,119 --> 01:46:16,360
then you got into the tub to soak then after a while you'd get out again and repeat the

823
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:23,960
process that's what a Japanese that's what we were treated to well then we got out and we were a

824
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:31,399
sort of how do you want to call totally relaxed with all of this we had a kimono we came back in

825
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:37,399
this was a Japanese room no beds nothing you know tatami on the floor a rice door

826
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:46,519
and then there would be a discreet knock and the horses would come in or one of the serving

827
01:46:46,519 --> 01:46:52,359
girls would come in and her kimono bowing like this set up a little table put the stuff on it

828
01:46:52,359 --> 01:47:00,439
and sit there and serve us pour the sake for us and my Japanese we didn't speak in the Japanese

829
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:07,239
of course but my Japanese friend much of would translate and he says if we like the service

830
01:47:08,039 --> 01:47:16,199
we are it is a part of the process to offer her a drink of sake and so we did that and she

831
01:47:16,199 --> 01:47:22,839
bowed gracefully and drank sake very nicely and then at the end they would blur all its

832
01:47:22,839 --> 01:47:29,000
away and then they would haul out the tatami that you were going to sleep on bed so to speak the

833
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:35,399
role and that would be put out on the mat on the floor and then we would sleep and at the end

834
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:45,159
of every one of these rooms was a glass partition that opened on to a private very small not bigger than

835
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:52,600
this room Japanese garden beautifully planted with plants we went around to a number of these places

836
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:59,720
and on one occasion on a Saturday night the Japanese they're way out on the countryside the men

837
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:05,880
leave their family they go out there and they have drunken orgies and one of these places we were on

838
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,880
second floor and I looked out the window in the morning and on this beautiful green lawn were a

839
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:19,320
number of recombinant forms sound asleep you know where they had collapsed after a night of drinking

840
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:26,599
inside the Japanese don't look at drunkenness in the same way that we do I've walked through Kyoto

841
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:31,880
and there will be a guy lying on the sidewalk the cops come along and very carefully

842
01:48:32,759 --> 01:48:38,039
picking up by the armpits dragging up to the wall and popping up right there and then walk on

843
01:48:42,039 --> 01:48:46,679
well that's about as much as I can tell you on that but that trip

844
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:56,039
is something few Americans have ever experienced and when I came back to Tokyo

845
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:02,760
macho said you know if Lisa had come with you we would have had none of this service because she

846
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:08,760
would have been expected to perform it I told my wife that she said it's good she didn't come along

847
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:19,000
well as you look back then you're creating science what are some of the things that you're most proud of?

848
01:49:21,239 --> 01:49:29,960
Well I think the thing that I'm most proud of Chris is that I've had what I think is a very happy

849
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:40,199
life and what I've done my childhood was I won't say actually impoverished but we lived through

850
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:47,640
the depression and portion of which my father was out of work and the notion that I would have

851
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:57,800
been able to do the things that I have been able to do would have been almost unthinkable for example

852
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:05,000
I've traveled all over the world I've made much more money than my father ever did and I have

853
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:12,440
kids that are successful at just and I've had wonderful colleagues and I've had a research career

854
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:23,159
that has kept me occupied even to date I don't think I could have planned it any better actually

855
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:30,039
if I'd had to set out ahead of time on the other hand when you look back on a long life you see

856
01:50:30,039 --> 01:50:37,800
that there are certain points where you've made decisions in a retrospect you're very happy with

857
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:45,639
but at the time it was almost a flip of the coin for example I very nearly married somebody else

858
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:53,000
before I met Lisa and decided not to it was touch and go my whole life would have been different

859
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:02,440
I wouldn't have had any of the same connections and Lisa's gifted scientist I wouldn't have had

860
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:12,039
anywhere near the career I've had were it not for the many contributions that she's made to it

861
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:17,800
we sat down last night and had a conversation about a problem I'm having and he came to a conclusion

862
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:31,800
about it so you know how it is and I don't know the way I mentioned this maybe I did when I got my

863
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:39,399
full bride and cooking on fellowships to Norway the previous year I had applied for a full bride

864
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:48,679
fellowship the application received was received too late if I'd gotten it which I was led to believe I

865
01:51:48,679 --> 01:51:54,119
would have if it'd been received in time I would have gone to Belgium I would never have had any of

866
01:51:54,119 --> 01:52:03,479
this Norwegian connection my life would have been totally different except for that week or so

867
01:52:04,199 --> 01:52:10,679
and getting the application in so when you're an old man like me you can think back on these

868
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:20,919
career changing decisions that you made so all in all I would say that I just had a very happy

869
01:52:20,919 --> 01:52:30,679
life and it's still happy except I see my friends falling one by one that's a depressing experience

870
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:35,400
but comes through us all

871
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:37,880
thanks very much

872
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:41,880
yeah well I'm enjoyed it
