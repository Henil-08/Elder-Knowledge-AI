1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,359
Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. So if you would just we'll start by having you state your name and

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:20,080
state and location. My name is Steve Lawson. Today is August 26th, 2011 and we're in a conference

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,960
room at the Valley Library. Okay. Today we'll be talking primarily about your interactions with

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,120
one is calling specifically trying to get a better sense of calling sort of personal character

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,600
at this. But before we get into that, two people you have like you talked a little bit about your life

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,519
starting out with sort of a thumbnail sketch of your biography before you into the LCI 1977.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,920
I was born in Pennsylvania in 1951 and lived there for the first few years of life. I remember

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
collecting donations for the Little League. World Championship is typically held in Williamsport,

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,159
Pennsylvania and Little League is big activity in that area of North Central, Pennsylvania.

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,240
We moved to Massachusetts along the coast north of Boston in the mid to late 1950s. I'm not

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,439
exactly sure of the date. But I went through elementary school and high school in Totsfield,

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,439
Massachusetts, which is a town in Essex County very close to the sea coast. We lived in Ipswich,

13
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:31,439
originally, which is a coastal town in Essex County. After graduation from high school,

14
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,120
I went to Stanford University and I was there in Palo Alto from 1969 to 1973. I started work at the

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Linus Poly Institute of Science and Medicine in 1977 and took a full-time job there in February of 1978

16
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,640
and had a number of different job titles there through the years. Eventually, we'd be coming chief

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,760
executive officer in 1993 about a year before Linus Poly died and have worked at the institute

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,640
for most of my career. What led you to develop your interest in science or

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,560
the university member of the career? Well, that's an interesting question. I was a little

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,920
rudderless, I would say, in college. It was very difficult for me to focus on a career. Some of my

21
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,679
friends were very career-oriented and became physicians and lawyers, went on to business school,

22
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:29,679
and so forth. That's pretty typical for an environment of academic excellence like Stanford

23
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:35,119
University. There were a lot of high achievers there. And I myself was a high achiever, of course,

24
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:41,759
in high school. California was a big adventure for me coming from the relatively state and

25
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,239
conventional East Coast. And it was very wild time to be in California in 1969 through 1973,

26
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,879
both culturally and politically. It was a lot of anti-war activity and sentiments. And, of

27
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,359
course, the counter-culture was really thriving in California at that time. In high school, I was

28
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:05,039
very interested in science and took advanced calculus and physics and chemistry and biology.

29
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:12,239
With the idea of perhaps becoming an architect, which led me to apply to Rensselaer Polytechnic

30
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,759
Institute as one of my college choices because they had a very strong department of architecture.

31
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,399
Stanford, at the time, had a department of architecture as well. And I decided ultimately to go

32
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:30,079
to Stanford. And after I got there within a year, they had completely dismantled the department

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,200
of architecture. So that pretty much pulled the rug out from under me with respect to that

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,800
initial potential career choice. I like science very much. I've always liked science very much.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,960
I've always been very curious about nature and how things work. And I think with respect to

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,520
a career in the Linus Poly Institute, although I was relatively naive about Linus Poly in high

37
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,320
school and even in my early years in college, I had been taking vitamin supplements beginning in

38
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:08,000
high school. Actually, my mom gave me one a day multivitamin supplements beginning probably when

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,400
I was just a kid. But then in the high school years, my friends and I got very interested in

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
supplements. And we're taking vitamin E and vitamin C and things like that. So the whole

41
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:28,479
mission of the Linus Poly Institute really resonated with me. And that led me to a position there

42
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,599
in 1977 that really was not science oriented at that time. It was more related to analysis of

43
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:40,959
the direct male program, which had been implemented within a few years before I joined the institute.

44
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,439
And it provided a relatively steady income for a lot of the non-grant supported research that

45
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,519
was going on at the institute, which of course in those days was most of the institute's research.

46
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:08,560
So between my graduation from Stanford and the time I joined the institute, it was a fairly

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,439
carefree and adventurous time. I spent a year after graduation traveling around the country

48
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,519
visiting family and friends in Florida and Georgia and Maine and New England. I wanted to see

49
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,000
the country. I'd been very impressed with John Steinbeck's books, travels with Charlie and others.

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,680
And also Jack Kerawak, who grew up and is now buried in the same area in which I grew up in Massachusetts.

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,000
So both of those writers had a very strong influence, I think, on me and my desires for

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,879
experience and adventure in the United States. When I returned to California, after traveling around

53
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,519
for a year or so, I took a series of jobs that really were not technical in nature at all.

54
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,439
Cost of living in those days was very low. I think for $100 a month, I could cover my living expenses

55
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,480
quite easily. And I was not, as I said, career oriented at the time. So I did not feel compelled

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,000
to go to graduate school or begin a career in earnest at that time and I didn't.

57
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,040
It wasn't until I joined the institute that I really started to focus more specifically on science,

58
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,879
which at that time really thrilled me.

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
Were there any, you mentioned your interest in supplements when you were in college and I

60
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,240
assumed that pollen was probably something you were aware of at least by the time you had

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
graduated? Was that true? And were there any other signs of their role models or mentors you had

62
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:38,319
during that time, dearly, from the money? Well, I began taking vitamins probably in an irregular way

63
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,959
when I was in high school, probably a senior in high school. And that continued on into my

64
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,319
early years in college. Of course, pollen had written vitamins in the common cold in 1970,

65
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,439
and friends of mine had open health food stores and had supplement products as part of their

66
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,759
merchandise or sales. So I was aware of this whole field, early on, without really knowing

67
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,719
specifically much about Linus Pauley. As a matter of fact, I knew very little of Linus Pauley,

68
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,959
even when I went to Stanford as a freshman. It wasn't until

69
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,360
probably about 1972 that I became more aware of him and it didn't have anything to do with science.

70
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
At the time, I don't believe he was teaching undergraduate courses in chemistry at Stanford,

71
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:27,839
which would have been my possible exposure to him. I don't think he was teaching graduate level

72
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,000
courses at Stanford either. But he was very politically active. And of course, this was during a lot

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,599
of pretty vehement anti-war protests around the country. Stanford was no exception to that kind of

74
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,239
activity. And in particular, there was a tenured professor of English, H. Bruce Franklin,

75
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:51,519
who was a Melville scholar, one of the world's foremost authorities on Melville, and has subsequently

76
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:58,240
done a lot of work in recognizing science fiction as an appropriate academic discipline for study.

77
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:06,639
And he had joined the Revolutionary Union and also Vence Aramos, which was an organization I believe

78
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,680
based in Redwood City, California. There were very politically active. They were kind of

79
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Maoist organizations, and they really wanted not only an end to the Vietnam War, but I think more

80
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,000
dramatic upheaval in the federal government at that time. And Stanford eventually had had

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,680
enough of H. Bruce Franklin and considered, I think, some of his activities borderline legal,

82
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,039
and Franklin was getting in a lot of trouble. And they decided to fire him. And of course, he was

83
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,240
a tenured professor. So that was a big ordeal in protocol that they had to work through in order to

84
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,480
fire him. Stanford trustees at the time were quite conservative. And I remember walking to class

85
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:55,279
down at the Quadrangle at Stanford, and I saw a protest outside the president's office.

86
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,080
And there were a group of undergraduates and other people assembled around a couple of people

87
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,960
waving protest signs. And the signs had something to do with the university had no right to fire,

88
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,680
a tenured professor for his political activity. And I saw these two fellows holding these signs,

89
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,159
and they looked grandfatherly to me at the time. And one was Linus Pauling, and the other one I

90
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,439
believe was Hal Holman, who was chairman of the Department of Medicine at Stanford University

91
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:29,439
Medical Center, who was a liberal and a good friend of Linus Pauling's at the time. And I remember

92
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:36,639
being very impressed with the fact that these two elderly gentlemen were taking the time out

93
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,719
from their busy schedules to go and actually protesting in front of the president's office. I

94
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,920
thought that was quite remarkable because at that time most of the political activity was

95
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,120
concentrated among very young people. Sometimes it was very random and chaotic and

96
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,560
encoed as well, but I thought it was quite remarkable that there were older people who were also

97
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,399
interested in demonstrating for the rights of people to express their political opinions. So that

98
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:11,039
was my first, that was really my first awareness of Linus Pauling was from the political perspective,

99
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,480
and not really from the scientific angle. It wasn't until I joined the Linus Pauling Institute that

100
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,559
I really became much more familiar with Linus Pauling's work in chemistry and in biology.

101
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,319
What was your area of study?

102
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:31,360
Well, when I joined, when I went to Stanford, as I mentioned, I was very interested in

103
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,800
architecture as a potential career. So I was taking engineering and architecture while that

104
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,320
department lasted. And I also had kind of a renaissance concept of undergraduate education at the time.

105
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,279
I thought it was very important to take as many courses and different subjects as possible. So I

106
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,920
was taking calculus and biology and art history and literature and poetry and just everything that I

107
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:02,799
thought I should be exposed to as an undergraduate. I graduated with degree in anthropology in 1973,

108
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,799
but I probably had almost enough credits and biology for a degree in biology or at least a minor in

109
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:17,199
biology. And at the time, there were a couple of pretty notorious professors at Stanford who made

110
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:23,599
a big impression on me. One was Colin Pitendrig in the biology department. He, I believe, also was

111
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,120
director of the Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey, taught a terrific course in biology and also

112
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,360
Cachadorian. William DeMent taught a very popular course in sleep and dreams that was very popular

113
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:47,519
among undergraduates. Phil Pzenbardo, of course, was teaching very popular psychology course at the time.

114
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,720
And he went on to some famous, the leader of the Stanford Prison Experiment, which was quite

115
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,320
influential at the time. How did you come to know about the landfilling institute and the job

116
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:11,120
you were doing in life for? Well, I had lived in Memel Park, Palo Alto for many years. The institute

117
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,320
was founded in 1973 on Sandhill Road, opposite the Stanford linear accelerator. And at that time,

118
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:28,720
that part of Sandhill Road, primarily the northern side of Sandhill Road, headed west, was a

119
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,600
series of relatively new buildings on Tom Ford property. He was a trustee of Stanford University.

120
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,840
And there were publishing companies and real estate companies and insurance companies.

121
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,320
Now that area is a high of venture capitalist activity. But the institute, in those days,

122
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,480
I believe the 2700 Sandhill Road shared relatively modern office building with Kemper Insurance Company.

123
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,240
And I was aware of the sign out on the street. So I'd driven by there many times on my way to the

124
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:12,480
coastal range or to the beach. And I think that if I remember correctly, I saw an advertisement in

125
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,080
the paper specifically for a job without a lot of detailed description about the nature of the job.

126
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,919
And I went to interview at the Linus Plain Institute of Science and Medicine and interviewed with

127
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,799
Art Robinson, who was then the president and director of the institute. And he hired me.

128
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,839
Do you recall the first time that you met Linus Plain?

129
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,599
Well, the first time I saw him, of course, was, as I said back in about probably 1972 when he was

130
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:51,199
demonstrating against the firing of H. Bruce Franklin. I met him in 1977 because my office was

131
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,199
just off the hallway that Pauling took to get to his office, which was adjacent to Art Robinson's

132
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,920
office, and also the accountant and controller were down at the end of that office as well.

133
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
And he was very aware of who was working at the institute and what all the activities were.

134
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,080
And he stopped in to introduce himself to me when I was sitting in my office one day. And of course,

135
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:19,440
I was, I had remembered him from Stanford and I had become more aware of his scientific legend,

136
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,640
of course, by then by working at the Linus Plain Institute. And I was also aware of the fact that

137
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,199
this was his institute and it was named after him. So of course, I had, I had high regard for him

138
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,039
as being the founder of this organization that I was now working for. But he impressed me as a very

139
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:41,840
warm, charming, very friendly person. He was not cerebral or distant at all, not a luth. He was very

140
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,159
very welcoming.

141
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,120
What he frequently around the institute, I mean, I know he traveled a lot, but we recall him being

142
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,720
of regular presence on a really nice day.

143
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,440
He did travel quite a lot, but I do remember him being a regular presence. Certainly when he was

144
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,399
in town, he would come by the institute that was his office and his main base of operations.

145
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,440
And if he had to do interviews or see guests, it was typically at the Linus Plain Institute in his office.

146
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,000
And I remember meeting many of his friends at that time, including an emissary from St. George's

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,399
lab at Woods Hole. I believe his name was. I can't think of his name right now. It started with a P.

148
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,759
It was very interesting in telling us about St. George's new theories regarding vitamin C and

149
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,639
the electronic basis of life. Vitamin C is an electron donor being very essential to life far

150
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,600
above its role in preventing scurvy or as an antioxidant. Dorothy Hodgkin also came through the

151
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,000
institute at that time and it was fairly soon after I arrived at the institute that I also met

152
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,759
you in Cameron, who of course was a Scottish surgeon who was collaborating intensively with

153
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:07,200
Linus Pauling on vitamin C and cancer work. Did you meet Dorothy Hodgkin? I did. I met Dorothy Hodgkin.

154
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:15,200
At that time, I believe I was working in the laboratory. I had begun a friendship with a

155
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,480
biochemist named Alan Sheetz at the institute as well as Dick Willoughby who was a biologist working

156
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,920
on the skin cancer and vitamin C experiments that Pauling had designed and were being carried out

157
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:34,560
by Art Robinson at the time. And as arts influence in the institute started to wane, people responsible

158
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,440
for a lot of the biological and biochemical work were encouraging me to get more involved in that work.

159
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,520
I seemed to have the aptitude for it. I was quite interested in it. So I moved out of the role

160
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,560
that I was originally hired to perform at the institute, which was this direct male solicitation

161
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:01,600
work and analysis into kind of a research assistant position in the labs. And that led me to come

162
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,720
in contact with people that Pauling would bring through the laboratory to show them the work that

163
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,759
we were doing. Bill Abarth at the time was running a volcano source field ionization mass spectrometer,

164
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,559
which was used for metabolite profiling, which was a big chunk of the institute's research at the time.

165
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,200
So people were always interested in coming down to the first floor and seeing that

166
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,319
rubbed goldberg contraption, which was always undergoing tinkering. Never seemed to be quite ready

167
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,000
for routine biological experimentation. And since I was working in the laboratory at that time,

168
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,319
I would meet people that Pauling would bring through the laboratory. And one of them with Dorothy Hodgkin.

169
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:50,400
So Pauling, you were hired in 1977 at LPI and have built a career there. Pauling lived until 1994.

170
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,480
So that's a 17-year period. And one of you can just generally characterize your relationship with Pauling.

171
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,400
How did you evolve over those 17 years? Sure. Well, originally I saw

172
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,599
little of him because my work did really not overlap with his research interests. I mean, of course,

173
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,920
he was heavily involved in the financial status of the institute. And Art Robinson was the main force

174
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,279
behind the Direct Mail solicitation program. But Pauling was certainly aware of that. And

175
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:32,160
once I started working in the laboratory more, we had more to talk about. And I became heavily involved

176
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,960
in the skin cancer and hairless mice program, which was testing the effect of different levels

177
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,920
of vitamin C in a mouse-chow diet on the development of skin cancer in hairless mice exposed to

178
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,880
ultraviolet light. And other arms of those experiments. And there were a number of experiments that

179
00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:00,720
took place over a number of years. Some of the other arms of that project involved feeding raw food

180
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,840
and nuts to mice to see whether that also inhibited the development of skin cancer when the mice

181
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,680
were exposed to ultraviolet light. So the mice were given things like carrots and pears and sunflower

182
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:21,519
seeds and tomatoes and other raw food to find out what effect that would have. And when Art

183
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:28,560
Robinson left, Pauling, of course, was interested in finding out how this work was going. And he asked

184
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,920
me to, I believe the first project that he asked me specifically to get involved in was to calculate

185
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,799
the amount of certain micronutrients in the food that these mice were fed. Because as scientists,

186
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,799
we tend to be a little reductionist, we want to find out if there is an effect with the whole

187
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,519
food, then what is it in the food that might be protective? So that was a very challenging

188
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,919
project that Pauling gave to me. And I was a bit frustrated because the way that the food had been

189
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,759
provided to the mice made it very difficult to determine how much an individual mouse consumed

190
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:17,440
of any particular food stuff. The mice were also caged five to a cage. And there were social

191
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,400
patterns that developed of hierarchy that developed within the cage. So there were dominant mice

192
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,359
who would eat the preferred food and then the less dominant mice would get what was left. So

193
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,839
there was some competition for the best food, the most flavorful food for the mice.

194
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:42,159
The way the food was provided to them was sometimes as a mush ground up or blended food and

195
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,240
sometimes as chunks of carrots and pears and so forth. The sunflower seeds were given to them

196
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,240
in small glass containers with metal lids that had a hole in them. And the mice would spray the

197
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,799
sunflower seeds out all over the place. And it was really impossible to determine the intake of

198
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,319
any of these foods for specific animal. And even for a cage of animals divided by five was really

199
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,879
not appropriate calculation. There was a lot of waste so a lot of the food would fall through the

200
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:22,000
mesh to the floor to the cage rack. And sometimes they would defecate and urinate in the sunflower

201
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,720
seed container as well and then wouldn't continue to eat once they'd already defecated or urinated

202
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:37,600
in that container. There were other issues as well. For instance the vitamin A content of carrots

203
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,960
can differ appreciably depending upon how long the carrots are stored after they've been picked.

204
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,440
And that was something that was not measured at the time. So there was no analysis,

205
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,039
biochemical analysis of the food that was provided to the animals. And depending upon the variety,

206
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,079
ripeness, length of time something had been stored whether it was refrigerated or stored at room

207
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,279
temperature. The micronutrient content of the food stuffs provided to the mice could very

208
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:15,440
appreciably. So I made the calculations and I sat down with Linus Pauling and told him that in my

209
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,839
estimation it was really impossible to glean any really useful detailed information about the

210
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,559
micronutrient intake of these animals and that the best we could do was say that the raw food

211
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,720
diet seemed to be protective but it was it was just too difficult to determine what constituents in

212
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,480
the raw food diet conferred that protection. So it was a little bit, I was a little bit ambivalent

213
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,279
about that. I think I did a very thorough and good job in making these determinations but ultimately

214
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,879
what I had to say was a little bit disappointing I think.

215
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,639
Oh he didn't react with disappointment. He reacted as I was presenting him with facts and

216
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:03,519
calculations and he was very seemed very pleased to get the information. It was not long after that

217
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,959
that you and Cameron began spending quite a lot more time at the institute and I believe they'd

218
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:16,399
taken an apartment nearby maybe Redwood City and Cameron of course was very interested in

219
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,160
high dose vitamin C as a junk to therapy and cancer as was Pauling and they had done some clinical

220
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,600
work together over the years beginning probably in 1971-1972 so it even preceded the founding

221
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,400
of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine. And Cameron was concerned with some of the

222
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:44,800
practical issues about the administration of high dose vitamin C to cancer patients who might

223
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,399
also be taking chemotherapy drugs and we know that vitamin C has some general detoxification

224
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:59,599
properties and Cameron specifically was concerned that if people were taking chemotherapy drugs

225
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,359
then should they take high dose vitamin C at the same time which might have an effect on the

226
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,119
efficacy of the chemotherapy drugs. So he didn't want to recommend to people that they take

227
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:18,959
high dose vitamin C while taking chemotherapy if the vitamin C was going to somehow adversely affect

228
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:26,399
these drugs. So he wanted to find a way to study this and in association with Linus Pauling and

229
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:34,079
Alan Sheetz we came up with the idea of using fish toxicology experiments which is a pretty well

230
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,319
established model for studying pollution in streams and lakes and bodies of water and things

231
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:48,559
like that. So we read a lot about fish toxicology Alan and I figured out how to reconstitute water

232
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:57,119
from distilled water by adding back certain salts to provide the proper habitat for fingerling trout.

233
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:05,359
And the idea was that we would have fingerling trout that would be exposed to vitamin C and

234
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:12,479
chemotherapy drugs dissolved in their water that they were living in and we would monitor any

235
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:19,759
observable effects in the fish and we hypothesized that they would be detected by abnormal behavior

236
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,959
in the fish which would have to do with the way they swim the distance that they cover in a certain

237
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:29,839
period of time and so forth. So there was some technology that was also developed to make these

238
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,599
kinds of measurements. So that was another project that I worked with you and Cameron Inline

239
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:43,359
as Pauling. Unfortunately we had to vacate the building at 2700 Sandhill Road in Menlo Park

240
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:52,000
ostensibly because there had been cracks in the building due to small earthquakes over time.

241
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,879
It wasn't a building that was set on bedrock it was on loose soil and the landlord wanted to

242
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,800
get the tenants out make some structural corrections in the building and I don't think the landlord

243
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,120
was overly excited by a laboratory in the building anyway. We were sharing the building with

244
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,960
Kemper insurance company and I think he was more happy with having nice dry insurance company

245
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,120
and having wet labs there with animal experiments and physics experiments and so forth.

246
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,840
So those experiments had to be wrapped up before we really brought them to fruition before we move

247
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,119
to the facility at 440 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto.

248
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,679
Were there other scientific collaborations with Pauling and over the course of your relationship?

249
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,079
There were. He would come into my office from time to time and we would talk about

250
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:50,639
ideas he had different projects that he was interested in. Occasionally he would ask me if I

251
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:55,599
would be interested in doing something like writing a book review which was a little surprising but

252
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,039
when Evelyn Richards book of Vitamin C in Cancer Medicine or Politics was published I believe in 1991

253
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,559
or 1992 Linus Pauling came into my office with a copy of the book and asked me if I would be

254
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,679
interested in writing a book review to be submitted to a nutrition journal and I of course said yes

255
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,480
and wrote the review which was subsequently published in a nutrition journal. Later

256
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,000
and of course I would go into his office from time to time and talk with him about different things.

257
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,120
The quantum chemist by the name of Zele Kermit who was collaborating with Pauling and

258
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,319
Problems in Theoretical Chemistry and Physics over the whole period in the late 1970s through Pauling's

259
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,319
death. Zele Kermit and I were both rock hounds. We had collected rocks and minerals when we were

260
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,440
kids and we knew that Pauling was was a great mineralologist and understood a lot about the

261
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,200
silicate minerals which are quite interesting so the three of us would amuse ourselves occasionally by

262
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,279
Zele Kermit and I would bring in some of our mineral specimens and we would sit in Pauling's office

263
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,120
and try to stump the expert essentially. Sometimes Zele Kermit and I would have forgotten the

264
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,080
identifications of some of the minerals we had so they would be presented to Dr. Pauling to see if

265
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,080
he could identify them and it was astonishing because even though he had probably not thought about

266
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:24,399
some of these things in many many years or even decades he infallibly was able to identify the

267
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,480
mineral and make a fairly quick identification so that was fun. It didn't have anything to do with

268
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,879
any of the research going on at the institute but it was it was very fun to to sit and talk with him

269
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:47,599
in that way. Later in the late 1980s and I'm going to say probably around 1988 Pauling came into my

270
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:54,319
office with an idea for a new technique to fabricate superconductive material and this was

271
00:28:54,319 --> 00:29:01,439
during kind of a heyday of resurgence of interest in ceramic superconductors but Pauling had a

272
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:07,119
vastly different idea which had to do with the way a material could be fabricated and perhaps

273
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,879
that would raise the temperature which would be superconductive and it had to do with

274
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,360
excuse me phone on dampening and his idea was that if you could have a conductive metal

275
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:30,080
like tin drawn to an incredibly fine fibrill as he called it maybe 10 or 20 angstroms in diameter

276
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,520
surrounded by insulating material like glass then the superconductive temperature of the tin

277
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,359
would be increased the TC of the tin would be raised and he talked with me about some ideas

278
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,720
that he had and how to make this material which he believed would be important in supporting a

279
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,359
patent application that he wanted to file and his goal I think in filing this patent application

280
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:02,879
as he described it to me and others was to generate a stable revenue source for the institute

281
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,840
so he wasn't interested in acquiring wealth on his own but he was interested in looking for

282
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,720
revenue sources for the institute which had lurched from one financial crisis to another

283
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,000
throughout my whole tenure at the Oinas Bong Institute of Science and Medicine and he thought

284
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,680
that this might be something that could be licensed and would generate lots of income so Zella

285
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,920
Kermann and I set up a laboratory Stanford industrial park at a least facility that the institute

286
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:40,080
had on Porter Drive which also has the Susakawa aging research facility and some storage area

287
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:51,120
and we set up a laboratory bought an oven some torches blow torches compress gas borosilicate glass

288
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,800
tin and Zee could develop a very interesting way to collect the material that we were going to

289
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:03,919
produce which was a bicycle inverted on a block of wood and we had taken the rubber tire off

290
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:10,079
the bike rim and we wanted to collect this glass clad fibrill of tin that we would generate

291
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,159
with torches above the furnace and then connect it to the bicycle wheel and then

292
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,399
use the pedals or a crank to turn the bicycle rim and then we would collect in a circular

293
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:31,040
fashion this long piece of glass that was filled with tin. So there was a lot of trial and error

294
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,320
involved in that and you and Kermann was aware of what we were doing as well and he developed

295
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,960
kind of a special interest in this as well so you and Kermann and Zella Kermann and I spent

296
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,160
quite a lot of time in this laboratory at Porter Drive trying to produce this material and it was

297
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,720
interesting in another way as well in that Pauline was very interested in seeing the laboratory

298
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,200
notebooks and wanted to be sure that we were taking copious and meticulous notes on what we were

299
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,960
doing and the laboratory notebook page for instance had to be signed and dated and then periodically

300
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,640
I believe once a week or once every two weeks someone who was not associated with the project was

301
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,400
asked to read what had been put in the laboratory notebook and countersign it so typically we asked

302
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,680
Emil Zucacamba who was the president of the institute at that time to read what we'd written in

303
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,160
the lab notebook and then he would countersign it and dated as well which was when I was working

304
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:36,960
as a scientist at the institute I think I was aware of how important it is to maintain good

305
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,600
protocol and filling out data and laboratory notebooks you don't erase things you cross them out

306
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,959
glue or tape things and use pen date and so forth so that in the future people who are unfamiliar

307
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:54,639
with your work could theoretically be able to go back and repeat what you'd done based only on

308
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:01,199
the information provided in the lab notebook and that was that concept was really driven home

309
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:05,519
through this work for Linus Pauline because he was very interested in us maintaining

310
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,400
very meticulous laboratory notebook which we did he was quite happy with it and after many months

311
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:20,240
of trial and error and kind of a sophisticated development of this technique and examination of

312
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,639
the product through high power magnification we were able to come up with material that we thought

313
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:33,119
would be suitable needed to be tested of course to see whether or not the superconductive temperature

314
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:40,319
had changed but Pauline was just ecstatic at that time he was in an apartment in Stanford and

315
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:46,319
we Zeke and I were very excited and we brought a sample of this down to his apartment and

316
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:54,319
he himself was very excited it was it was I can imagine that he exhibited this kind of

317
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,719
emotion many times throughout his life whenever he made an important scientific discovery or

318
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,400
became aware of an important discovery that influenced his own work but he just looked joyful

319
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:14,960
and he immediately went over to the mantle on fireplace and got a big cubic pyrate crystal and

320
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,199
gave one to me and gave something to Zeke and then said be sure to bring your copies of General

321
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:26,320
Chemistry in and unscribed them on the occasion of this happy discovery and invention that we've

322
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,440
made and that work formed the basis for his patent application and I believe his patent for

323
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:41,440
novel technique for fabricating superconductive material was awarded in perhaps 1991 I think

324
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,080
to where initial applications submitted as early as 1988-1989 but I think that the final application

325
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:55,440
was the final patent was granted in 1991. Was that technique ever employed on any of them?

326
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,360
Well it would turn out to be very difficult to measure changes in superconductivity

327
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,960
in this material because if you can imagine getting an appropriate contact between

328
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,239
the end of this tin fibro that was maybe 10 to 20 angstroms in diameter was extremely difficult.

329
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:18,719
We sent the material off to General Electric and connected he Pauling had

330
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:23,519
contacted a number of his friends in industry to find out if they had equipment that might be

331
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:29,759
capable of measuring making these measurements for us so there were problems in actually making

332
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:35,439
the measurements but the vice president of the institute Rick Hicks at the time felt that since

333
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:42,399
we had the patent in hand we should try to license it so he embarked on a process of

334
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,960
trying to identify companies in the United States that might be interested in licensing

335
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,360
this technology and he wasn't having much success in this country he went to Japan I believe in

336
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,800
probably about 1991 or 1992 and tried to shop it around there also without I'm sure there was

337
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,559
interest expressed but there was nothing that was really consummated at the time and it led to

338
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:18,719
kind of an interesting exchange sometime later when Rick had returned from Asia some months had

339
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,960
gone by Emil Zucacondo called me on the intercom if I would come down to his office because we had

340
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,679
a visitor and I went down to his office and we had someone there from the Central Intelligence

341
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:39,119
Agency who was very interested in this particular invention and wanted to know why we were

342
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,119
shopping this around in Japan and in other countries rather than the United States and I explained

343
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,239
to him that well the reason was we hadn't been able to find anyone in the United States who was

344
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,639
interested I thought it was quite interesting that the CIA seemed to know about this

345
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,559
and that was the end of that that was pretty much the end of that I think there was a misq

346
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:11,359
later that had to do with the turmoil surrounding Pauling's death and succession of people in

347
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,359
charge of the institute and files being shifted around and so forth and somehow the application to

348
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,079
continue the maintenance fee on that particular patent fell through the cracks so I think that

349
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,719
I think the reason that it died effectively was because the maintenance fee was not paid

350
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,960
unfortunately.

351
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,840
Not really I think that the vitamin C and skin cancer experiments of course I was co-author of

352
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:50,400
one of the papers that resulted from that work and in the superconductive material were

353
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,160
two major collaborations. How do you describe Coins' style of the scientists and what do you

354
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,920
observe where I think the greatest strengths of the scientists? Well he as many people have

355
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,880
remarked had an encyclopedic knowledge of physics chemistry biology perhaps medicine

356
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,000
mathematics statistics had an incredibly good grasp of statistics and that served

357
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,599
him very well I think as a scientist because he was as I like to say perhaps the best embodiment

358
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,320
of the multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary attack on scientific problems and of course that's

359
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,079
a buzz word in science today and that's what the NIH and funding agencies encourage is kind of

360
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,480
team activity but it was remarkable that this kind of knowledge expansive and encyclopedic

361
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,480
knowledge was exhibited in one particular person in the in Linus Pauling which I think was quite

362
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:59,039
remarkable. So his memory as well his ability to extract references and facts and material from

363
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,000
other papers and so forth that span most of his life was quite remarkable so I think those two

364
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,240
things served him incredibly well as a scientist and I saw that in action many times when he could

365
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,319
cite other literature and talk about what other people had found and so forth so I was very

366
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:25,199
impressed by his grasp of science and his memory and he also struck me as being very courageous.

367
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:31,519
As I said earlier my first exposure to him in the political arena I thought he was quite courageous

368
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,839
at that time later I became aware of just how courageous he was when he was facing the US Senate

369
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:44,000
with respect to allegations of his lack of patriotism or something like that and he basically

370
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,680
stood them down which I thought was incredibly courageous and in another sense he was a very courageous

371
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,200
scientist when Zullic and I were working with this furnace in the late 1980s at Porter Drive. Pauling

372
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,880
would come up from time to time and one time in particular he put on a lab coat and put on gloves

373
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,559
and goggles and was wielding the torch above the 800 degree furnace as well so he was actively

374
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,360
engaged in this experimental project which I thought was quite extraordinary so he didn't

375
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,840
really prefer to just sit at his desk and think about things he also wanted to get hands on when

376
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,519
something really intrigued him or interested him and during the mouse skin cancer experiments as

377
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,160
well he would often come through the laboratory just to check on things see how things were going

378
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,359
asked people questions about the work that was underway and so forth so he was not removed from

379
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,440
the experimental side of things although clearly he was involved in a lot of other things and didn't

380
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,960
actually participate physically in a lot of the experimental work in those days he he didn't

381
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,519
he wasn't a stranger in the laboratory and I witnessed that first hand with the work on

382
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:01,679
superconductivity where he actually was engaged experimentally and I think that was probably the last

383
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,799
experimental work that he was engaged in because at that time he probably would have been in his

384
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:11,359
late 1980 this was the late 1980s so he was in his late 80s as well.

385
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:21,199
Over time you your role leads to change from that of scientific researcher to more of

386
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,679
the administrator and I'm wondering if you engage in other different kinds of work with Pauling

387
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,039
in that context that was demonstrated. Very much so I had asked I had been asked to become

388
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:41,119
an assistant to the president when he meals at the was president of the institute. At the time I

389
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,679
was co-director with a meal of the laboratory for research and gene regulation and we had a small

390
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:51,759
research group we were looking at problems and cancer metastasis using protein profiling techniques

391
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,880
which had just recently been developed and we were developing instrumentation that would allow us

392
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,680
to increase reproducibility and reduce noise in the experimental procedure and we were very

393
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,440
interested in discovering genes and proteins that might correlate with the metastatic the

394
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,360
development of the metastatic phenotype in both marine and human cancer cells. Excuse me

395
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:26,320
so I was also working a bit administratively with a meal of zucocondle at that time and then when

396
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:33,280
a meal retired from the institute on the occasion of his birthday there was quite a lot of

397
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:41,280
turmoil at the institute because there are a number of problems one problem was the institute as I

398
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,000
mentioned earlier had a history of financial instability and over the years under e-mails direction

399
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,280
the institute expanded quite significantly to include some projects that probably would not be

400
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,760
considered strictly in the realm of orthomolecular medicine of course which was Paulings most

401
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,240
I think the reason he set up the institute to begin with and something that he felt strongest about

402
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:15,279
so I think a meal may have had a desire for the institute to become a more comprehensive

403
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:21,279
institute of molecular biological and chemical and biological sciences similar to the

404
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:27,359
Salkins institute down in southern California which is a fine template but there weren't

405
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:36,800
enough grants one by institute staff to support all the varied activities that were going on

406
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,120
so concomitant with e-mails retirement and retirement of Rick Hicks from the institute there was

407
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,200
a shift in focus in the institute and the board of trustees decided that there really weren't

408
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,039
enough funds to sustain all the varied programs underway at the institute so the idea was to

409
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:02,159
pair back some of the strictly molecular biological work that wasn't funded extramarially by government

410
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:09,840
grants from DOE or NIH or NCI or whatever and refocus specifically on orthomolecular medicine

411
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,759
and at about that time Linus Pauling had begun a friendship and scientific collaboration

412
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:23,360
with a German cardiologist Matthias Rat who together with Pauling had developed some interesting

413
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:30,079
hypotheses about the relationship of lipoprotein A which is a risk factor for atherosclerosis

414
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,240
and a major constitutive atherosclerotic plaque and vitamin C and they published a number of

415
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:44,720
hypothesis papers a very famous one being in PNAS and developed decided to set up a laboratory for

416
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,880
cardiovascular disease research that was directed by Dr. Rat and Pauling was very excited about this

417
00:44:50,880 --> 00:45:00,400
work when and at some point and I don't remember the exact time but it was after a meal had retired

418
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,000
and Pauling became for short time the president and director of the institute after a meal

419
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:15,360
he asked me to become his assistant and I wasn't quite sure what that meant so I had written him

420
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:25,599
note or memo asking him what he wanted me to do and I had some ideas mainly of administrative nature

421
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,680
as to things that I thought could result in in big improvements in the way the institute was

422
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,760
was run and our status financial status and other issues but he disappeared to Big Sur to his

423
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,800
ranch down on the coast of California for some time and I felt a little adrift and at by this

424
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,600
time I had gotten to know Linus Plain Jr fairly well because he was I think in the process of

425
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,840
getting more actively involved in the administration and the institute because he recognized his

426
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,800
father was ill and there were a lot of problems at the institute and he felt he should step in

427
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:10,400
to help his father which I thought was very commendable and eventually I became the executive officer

428
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,320
at the institute which was similar in function to being president of the institute and then later

429
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,400
the board appointed me chief executive officer I think in about 1993 technically I became chief

430
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,320
executive officer so throughout this period where I functioned in different administrative roles

431
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,360
I worked very closely with Linus Plain Jr the Board of Trustees and of course by that time

432
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,120
Linus Plain had become chairman of the Board of Trustees and director of research at the institute

433
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,840
but didn't really have an administrative role any longer in the Linus Plain Institute of Science and

434
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Medicine because I think everyone felt that it would be best if he were spared the problems that

435
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:01,039
we had to resolve and there were problems concerning relocation it was a zoning issue where the

436
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:07,600
least property on which our building was situated at 440 page mill road in Palo Alto was scheduled to

437
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,320
change from commercial to residential zoning quite quickly and no long range plans had really

438
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,720
been developed to deal with that zoning change and we didn't have an endowment had very little money

439
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,799
so the prospect of moving the institute trying to keep it intact in the mid peninsula but paying

440
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:35,919
maybe 10 or 20 times more in rent was not very encouraging and Linus Plain himself of course had

441
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:41,119
been diagnosed with prostate cancer and although he was undergoing a number of different experimental

442
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,480
therapies it was not believed that he would survive his illness and we were very concerned about

443
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,079
what would happen to the institute after his death would we be able to continue to raise money

444
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,679
to support the institute as a viable research organization and then of course there were lawsuits

445
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,240
and there was quite a lot of litigation at that time Matthias Rat had left the institute and it

446
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,920
sued the institute for infringement in his business activities and also sued Linus Pauling so I

447
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:17,360
had to manage a lot of our litigation at that time as well so my role at the time the big

448
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,000
challenges were finding a future home or at least the disposition of the Linus Plain is to do

449
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,480
the science and medicine keeping it intact and reputable and also managing our litigation which

450
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:37,200
was very burdensome and took absorbed a lot of my time and a lot of the boards time as well

451
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,240
but Pauling was largely spared from that I mean he was deposed of course a number of times but

452
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,720
I managed a lot of our legal affairs at that time in close association when Linus Plain

453
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,920
Jr was the chairman of the board and at that time we had very regular board meetings as well so

454
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,039
the board of trustees was kept well-apprised of all the activities and their opinions were

455
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:08,000
solicited in many of these activities as well so it was a very challenging time for me I was

456
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
surprised to be honest when the board asked me to become chief executive officer because it kind

457
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,360
of came out of the blue the work that I was doing with a musica condo was not really related to

458
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,639
orthomolecular medicine wasn't related to vitamin C at the time as I said we were looking at

459
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:30,400
metastatic cancer which really had nothing to do with orthomolecular medicine so I was concerned

460
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,240
my group and my job were in jeopardy as well because there were rumors circulating that

461
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,400
the board wanted to refocus on orthomolecular medicine and since my work wasn't involved in

462
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,519
orthomolecular medicine I thought perhaps I might be laid off from the institute as well

463
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,360
at about the same time a musica condo wanted to collect some of the people who were doing

464
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:01,280
molecular biological work in a new institute called the Institute of Molecular Medical Sciences

465
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,960
which he hoped to rent space from the Linus-Planning Institute of Science and Medicine in the same

466
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,760
building so I spent quite a lot of time as executive officer with Zele Kerman analyzing that

467
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:23,039
proposition trying to figure out whether it was practical and if so how building expenses should

468
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,719
be shared between the two groups and so forth so I spent quite a lot of time in those kinds of

469
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,440
deliberations at that time too and eventually we came up with a recommendation to Linus-Planning

470
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:43,920
in the board. One of Pauline's some calling cards of Caltech anyway then the Golden Year

471
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:53,360
and Caltech was his ability to collect and marshal and oversee tremendous talent of scientific

472
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,720
researches or the graduate students or postdocs and I'm wondering if you have there this and one sort of

473
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,680
dynamic going on and over the course of the time I don't get it with his ability to collect talent and

474
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,760
make it efficient productive. Well I think our Robinson is a terrific scientist and art of course

475
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,680
was working very closely with Linus-Planning at the University of California San Diego and then

476
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,080
came up to run his lab and collaborate with research at Stanford and there's no question that

477
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,360
Dr. Robinson was an extraordinarily capable scientist and with Pauline developed lots of very

478
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:37,280
interesting ideas so that was one person that he worked with over that period of time that I had

479
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,760
a lot of respect for and I think Pauline had a lot of respect for at least until there was a

480
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,440
big schism that developed between them which was very painful to watch especially at that time I

481
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,960
was not really privy to a lot of the major administrative decisions at the institute so it was a

482
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:59,440
little unclear as to why this conflict had developed but it was very difficult an uncomfortable time

483
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:10,560
for everyone I think at the institute. Excuse me. Bill Aberg, I'm Bill Aberg, physicist was also

484
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:17,759
very extraordinarily talented individual who was developing the mass spectrometer for

485
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:25,199
metabolite profiling. Emil Zucacondle who had developed the idea of chemical paleogenetics or

486
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:31,199
molecular evolution with Pauline earlier in the 1960s was an extraordinarily bright capable scientist.

487
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:38,559
He was also the founding editor of the journal of molecular evolution and was

488
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:46,799
one of those rare individuals who's capable of sustaining simultaneously many complex thoughts and I

489
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:52,719
saw this in action many times I have tremendous respect and admiration for Emil Zucacondle he's

490
00:52:52,719 --> 00:53:00,400
really an extraordinary scientist and theorist so yes there were people of extraordinarily high

491
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,239
caliber that were involved with the institute and of course there were collaborations as well

492
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,399
in some of Pauline's collaborators who would visit the institute from time to time.

493
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:20,559
There were a few problems in that since the institute did not have stable financial resources

494
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:30,479
or an endowment it was difficult to attract high caliber scientists. There were high caliber

495
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,240
scientists who were employed at the institute John Levit, Jim Fleming, Greg Spicer,

496
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,440
there were a number of people that were very very good you and Cameron as a medical director

497
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,639
but it was difficult because not much could be offered to people other than at will contract which

498
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:59,280
was the way that most contract most employment is handled in California unless you have an employment

499
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:07,120
contract and it was imprudent to offer employment contracts to people so initially it was kind

500
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:13,760
of an implied at will employment arrangement with people and then later in the early 1990s it

501
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,480
became very explicit at will employment relationship with employees but nevertheless there were people

502
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,680
who were attracted to the institute because of Linus Pong because of his interest in vitamin C

503
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:32,159
Dr. Connie Chow and others who did a lot of really terrific work Wulcott.com just to mention

504
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,199
a few but there were a number of really excellent people there physicians and scientists who did a

505
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:46,159
lot of very good work over the years and in those days it was also very difficult to get expect and

506
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:51,679
get funding from the National Institutes of Health or the National Cancer Institute for the kind

507
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:56,399
of work that Pauline was especially interested in which had to do with vitamin C in cancer so I'm

508
00:54:56,399 --> 00:55:07,199
sure you're aware of his difficulty in getting grants to carry out this kind of research with the

509
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,919
very promising clinical work that Cameron had been doing in Scotland Pauline and Cameron went to

510
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:17,919
the NCI with that work repeatedly and they suggested that he applied for funds to do animal work

511
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,119
and soul culture work and he applied for those funds and was turned down repeatedly over seven

512
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:30,000
or eight consecutive years so the money that was supported that kind of work at the institute was

513
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,200
sought from the public through this direct mail solicitation campaign and that was the money that

514
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,559
was available to pay the researchers who were doing that work.

515
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,880
We'll close it now in an hour if you didn't do it okay.

516
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,920
Yeah.

517
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:54,559
Pauline is remembering to also famously being a terrific lecture and I wonder if you could come in on that

518
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,360
your experience and see him in lecture and his facility in that regard.

519
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,400
Yes.

520
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,960
I didn't see him lecture very often.

521
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,079
I saw him give lectures at Stanford University and of course he would give the famous vitamin C

522
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,440
lecture where he would stand on stage and pull from his...

523
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:21,360
He typically wore a three-piece suit when he was giving a lecture, a dark suit, sometimes

524
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:28,000
he would wear his beret and he would invariably begin his lectures on vitamin C by pulling out

525
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:35,440
a vial, a test tube and holding it up with his fingers with a very small amount of a white

526
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,360
powder at the bottom that was barely detectable from the audience perspective and you would say

527
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:46,960
this represents the RDA for vitamin C. This is the amount of vitamin C that the food nutrition

528
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,800
board believes that people should get every day and he would follow that by pulling

529
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:59,840
out a large test tube with 13 grams of vitamin C in it and you could obviously see all this white

530
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,160
powder and the vial from across the auditorium and he would say this is the amount of vitamin C

531
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,160
that a goat synthesizes on average every day. I think goats know more about nutrition than the

532
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,960
food nutrition board and of course that always got a big round of applause and chuckles from the

533
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:25,519
audience. One lecture I saw him give which really stood out in my mind was a lecture,

534
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:33,760
departmental lecture to biostatistics at Stanford and that department was chaired by Byron Brown

535
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,559
who was a leading biostatistician and the Stanford Department of Biostatistics is World

536
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,240
Renown. They've been World Renown for many decades and Byron Brown was the father of a classmate

537
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:52,719
in mind from Stanford so I knew him and he had become aware of Pauling's work with Abraham

538
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:59,679
Hofer on a regiment provided adjunctively to cancer patients which included not only vitamin C

539
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:06,399
but also B vitamins, vitamin E zinc and some other things and Pauling and Hofer had published two

540
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:12,719
papers on this regiment and Pauling believed that it was even more effective than the sole use of

541
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:19,519
vitamin C which was given either intravenously or orally sometimes both by Ewing Kermit and Scotland.

542
00:58:20,879 --> 00:58:27,039
And they had and Pauling had developed a statistical analysis of this data based on work done by an

543
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:32,799
old friend of his from UC Berkeley by the name of Harden Jones and Pauling believed that this

544
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:40,959
statistical analysis was better than the standard Kaplan Meyer mortality analysis because by using

545
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:49,440
Harden Jones analysis you could actually resolve sub cohorts that had similar death rates

546
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,679
and you might be able to learn more about these sub cohorts with with similar death rates.

547
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:03,360
So he thought that this was was a better way to analyze mortality data from from clinical studies

548
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:10,480
and he published also I think was Ella Kermann and perhaps it was PNAS on this Harden Jones

549
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,360
analysis of mortality data and he was invited by Byron Brown to give a lecture to the

550
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:21,679
biostatisticians at Stanford on this Harden Jones mortality data and of course at the time everybody

551
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:28,240
was using Kaplan Meyer which is the standard step staircase type curve that you see published in

552
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,800
papers and I went with Pauling and Herman to that lecture which was in a large conference

553
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:43,200
in Harvard Stanford and it was astonishing how little criticism he got from this analysis.

554
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,120
I think he was prepared to be well he was never really defensive about anything because he was

555
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:56,080
very sure was on intelligence and his own analysis but no one had any serious criticisms of his

556
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:01,840
analysis and people were saying that well perhaps we should we should look at this more carefully

557
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:08,079
and perhaps this does offer a better alternative to Kaplan Meyer analysis in some circumstances.

558
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,280
It was quite extraordinarily quite extraordinary to see some of the world's leading biostatisticians

559
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,519
react that way to something that was fairly novel and and something that was certainly not

560
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:26,240
standardly employed in in this kind of analysis and it was quite interesting to see him present

561
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,680
present that analysis.

562
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:36,000
I wonder if you could speak a little bit more about Pauling in the mentor as well as your

563
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,679
software and others as well.

564
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,480
He was very encouraging and as I said he was not a Louvre so he was very easy person to speak with.

565
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,599
I think at the time that I got to know him of course he was in his 80s and at that time he was

566
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,279
considered kind of an icon in science and everyone was extraordinarily respectful to Linus Pauling.

567
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:09,119
No one at the institute called him by his first name for instance it was always Professor Pauling

568
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:15,279
or Dr. Pauling even Dorothy Monroe the secretary and assistant called him Dr. Pauling and

569
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:20,960
typically Zele Kerman would call him Professor Pauling. Emile Zucacondo typically called him Dr. Pauling

570
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:28,000
as did Rick Hickson. So there I think that was a measure of respect that all the people at the

571
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:39,280
institute had for him. He was also very interested in people on a personal basis as well and

572
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:49,519
I remember when he had decided not to drive so much himself anymore from his apartment on

573
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:55,599
Stanford campus to the institute which was just a a mile or two away. People would volunteer to

574
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,239
drive him from his apartment to the institute and then take him back to his apartment at the end of

575
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,800
the day and I did that quite often because I enjoyed talking with him and I also enjoyed to have

576
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,840
an uninterrupted period with him where he was free from telephone calls and appointments and

577
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,280
other distractions because there were a lot of demands on his time throughout his career I imagine

578
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,120
and at the institute there were always people calling wanting to interview him wanting him to give

579
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,960
lectures and so forth and wanting to visit him so it was rare to have an occasion to actually

580
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,840
talk with him one-on-one with no distractions and he would occasionally ask me about my long-term

581
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:40,000
aspirations and make suggestions and he would often tell me stories. He loved to tell stories

582
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,760
about things that had happened to him that were based on work that we were doing at the institute

583
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,440
or that might have been stimulated by a comment I would make to him and I remember one time

584
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,760
this is a little off topic because it doesn't have anything to do with mentorship but I think it

585
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:03,599
gives you some insight into his sense of humor during one of these trips where I was taking him to

586
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:09,920
the institute. He told me that he had been over at the Stanford Library to look at an old issue

587
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:16,960
of nature or science from close to the early part of the 20th century close to the turn of the

588
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:23,920
century and this was when David Star Jordan was president of Stanford University, Leland Stanford

589
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,360
who was chairman of the board, David Star Jordan was an ornithologist excuse me Iqtheologist

590
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:36,960
who had written books on academic books on fish and he was president of the university at that time

591
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,119
as well as being a scholar and Pauling had been looking through an old issue of nature and

592
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:47,599
for a specific article but this other story caught his eye and it had to do with a controversy that

593
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:54,320
had developed at Stanford between David Star Jordan and Leland Stanford and Leland Stanford apparently

594
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:01,280
had become unhappy with David Star Jordan because during trustees meetings Jordan did not refer

595
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:08,480
the trustees by name and Stanford thought that this was not civil and perhaps even borderline

596
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:15,519
rude not to refer to them by name and he had implored Jordan to learn the names of the trustees

597
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:22,240
and in subsequent meetings to refer to them by name and Jordan's retort apparently to Stanford

598
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,120
was well I'm afraid if I enforce to memorize the name of a trustee I'll forget the name of a fish

599
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,719
and Pauling thought that was hilarious and it gives you an idea of what he valued

600
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,039
because I think he was definitely on the side of Jordan in that argument

601
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:50,880
oh there were lots of other stories one time it wasn't during a drive but it was when

602
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:59,760
I was negotiating in contract with Unilever and Elizabeth Arden who had decided to develop a line

603
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,119
of cosmetics that included some antioxidants and wanted to get the institute involved in this

604
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,920
not in a research and development capacity but they wanted to support some research at the institute

605
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:16,320
and provide us with a lot of money and I've been talking many times with Linus Pauling about

606
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,360
this prospect and went in to talk with him in his office about it and he said oh he remembered

607
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:27,519
one time that he and Abe Helen had gone to visit Lord Leaver in England and had brought along

608
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:35,760
a bottle of scotch whiskey as a present and it was in their bag and they got to Lord Leaver's

609
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:42,480
castle or home and they were met by servants who immediately took their bags and they were

610
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,280
ushered in to see Lord Leaver and Pauling and his wife were chatting with him and Pauling

611
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,480
remembered that he had a gift so he wanted to excuse himself and go to his room and get the gift

612
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,599
for Lord Leaver and he went up to his room and the servants had already unpacked their bags

613
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:04,800
put clothes in the drawers or hanging in the closet and they'd also taken out the bottle of whiskey

614
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,360
and uncapped it and had two jiggers there ready for Pauling and his wife

615
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,760
because they believed that Pauling had brought this along to serve himself

616
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,360
so he thought it was very funny that he had to present Lord Leaver with a bottle of whiskey

617
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:28,000
that had already been opened but he explained to him why it had been open and one other story

618
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,519
that I thought was quite indicative of Pauling's character was told to me by you and Cameron

619
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:42,000
and Cameron of course had been collaborating very closely with Pauling and Pauling had decided to

620
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:50,880
visit Cameron as home and walk one inside on a trip that he was making to England and Cameron

621
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,880
told me that he was a little bit ambivalent about this visit by the great man of science

622
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,480
to his humble home in Scotland and he was worried that it wouldn't be presentable enough so he and

623
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,519
his wife made elaborate preparations to welcome Linus Pauling and his wife to their their humble

624
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:13,840
home in Scotland and the day that Pauling arrived Pauling arrived and within half an hour before

625
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:21,119
Pauling had arrived the toilet stopped up and Cameron hadn't had time to do anything about it before

626
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,800
the arrival of Linus Pauling and his wife so Pauling and his wife arrived and they came in and

627
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,600
the pleasantries were exchanged and Cameron showed them around the home and the view and so forth

628
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:38,480
and Pauling asked to use the bathroom and Cameron said which I'm very very sorry it's characteristic

629
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,600
way but there seems to be a problem with the toilet and Pauling so what's the problem and Cameron

630
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,240
explained to him the toilet had just gotten stopped up and hadn't had time to do anything and Pauling

631
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:54,560
said well let's go in and fix it so Cameron was a bit of gasp but said okay so the two of them went

632
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:00,559
into the bathroom and Pauling cut down with a with a wrench and Cameron had the plumbers helper

633
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,000
and Pauling had a wrench and he was lying on the floor with working on the plumbing fixing

634
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:12,239
Cameron's toilet so Cameron realized that he didn't really need to be too careful about what he

635
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:17,680
said or how Pauling was treated after that because he recognized that Pauling was was not a

636
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,079
and a luke cerebral sort of person who didn't get his hand dirty so to speak so

637
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:33,680
he mentioned one year maybe the first experience upon you had was of him doing it

638
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:40,720
that operated in DC politics and I'm wondering if you could put a little bit more on what you saw it

639
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,960
and then you said that it was a piece of activism and a political thought of it and of course the ending year

640
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:50,159
well of course I myself was very much opposed to the Vietnam War my brother was killed there

641
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:55,840
as a fighter pilot in 1970 which really almost interfered with me resuming my studies at Stanford

642
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:02,400
because it was emotionally very difficult time and I had never understood the logic of the war

643
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:08,159
I didn't buy that domino theory that the administration time was was promoting with respect to

644
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:14,479
we need stock communism Vietnam because then all all the countries in southeast Asia will become

645
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:20,319
communist and Indonesian and Japan might be attacked and so forth I didn't buy that explanation

646
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,519
and it seemed to me that the war had been going on for a very long time and was resulting in a lot

647
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:33,040
of misery and I couldn't see how it was constructive I couldn't see a good outcome so I I think had

648
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,480
sentiments that were very similar to those espoused by the line is Pauling at the time

649
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:45,200
and Pauling of course as I learned had been an old hand in political activism originally

650
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:51,760
stimulated by his concern about proliferation of nuclear weapons and medical concerns about

651
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:57,119
the effect of widespread fallout from atomic bomb testing in the atmosphere so that that really

652
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:03,360
resonated very strongly with me there were some people at the institute who were even further left

653
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,199
and I would consider myself in some ways conservative in many ways liberal as well but there were some

654
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:15,760
people at the institute who were I would say probably extreme leftist and I remember in particular

655
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:22,000
after one of Pauling's talks at Stanford that was peace related there was quite a lot of

656
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,640
unhappiness among some people because Pauling had made the statement during this talk that

657
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,520
he believed that the retention of some nuclear weapons by both the Soviet Union and the United

658
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:45,039
States and the so-called mutually assured destruction principle had actually resulted perhaps in

659
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:54,400
deterrent from having a nuclear war conflagration so they were they were surprised to hear him say

660
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:59,920
that because I think some people had hoped that he would espouse the opinion that we should destroy

661
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,360
all weapons you know laterally and so forth but that's not what he said in his lecture he said

662
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,880
that he believed that having some of these weapons by opposing forces would have probably resulted

663
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,880
in the satisfactory stalemate because either side was inhibited from using them knowing what

664
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:26,000
would result from that first use of an atomic weapon. That was a independent method that you

665
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,520
developed pretty early on in the 60s like the 60s in Paul? Yeah and I heard him say that several times

666
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:41,440
so he definitely was not I would say he wasn't a pacifist because he said many times the World

667
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:50,720
War II was well justified and he as you know worked closely with the military to develop armaments

668
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:56,320
and instruments that helped the Allied effort during World War II and he was certainly opposed to

669
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:02,319
Hitler and Nazism and I always saw him as a great patriot and it never occurred to me that

670
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,319
great patriotism and opposition to the Vietnam War or opposition to

671
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:15,359
atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was somehow couldn't be reconciled and some people

672
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,920
they didn't seem to be to be mutually exclusive characteristics.

673
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:39,119
Pauline was not someone who engaged often in small talk? So even in the many discussions that I

674
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:46,479
had with him he wasn't someone who liked to talk about pop culture or movies or music or literature

675
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,599
or anything of that nature. He loved to talk about science and especially about things that he

676
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,960
was interested in and he loved to tell stories and most of the stories were related to things that

677
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:10,160
interested him from a scientific basis. So I don't recall ever talking with him specifically

678
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:17,200
about any political activities and unfortunately I never thought to ask him more closely about

679
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,200
some of his political activities because there were always other things to talk about and

680
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,239
I didn't really query him much about his personal history when I knew him we were always talking

681
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:30,639
about current things or things that we were going to be doing in the future and not so much

682
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:36,639
retrospective issues except when he would tell me stories based on a current stimulating

683
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:42,720
conversation that we might be having but no he didn't generally talk about political issues with

684
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,559
staff. It was mainly related to administrative issues and scientific issues.

685
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,160
What was he like in larger social settings?

686
01:13:52,160 --> 01:14:02,000
Well in larger social settings he was often the person that people gravitated to. He had a

687
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,840
real charismatic personality kind of a magnetic personality. He always had a big smile. He was very

688
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:17,680
engaging, very warmly greeted people in a social setting, was physical, shook hands, put his arm

689
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:25,520
around people. So he was very engaging and people responded to that and that's why so many people

690
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:32,239
loved him over the years and when he died in 1994 the institute collected hundreds and hundreds

691
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:38,319
of cards from people that didn't know Linus playing personally but had been deeply affected by

692
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:44,719
his death and were grieving and sharing their grief with us at the time and everyone at the

693
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,359
institute felt the same way as well. I mean it was a really when he died in 1994 it was a very

694
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:56,079
emotional moment for all of us because he just he had a way of generating a lot of positive

695
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:01,599
emotion about him and a lot of people loved him and respected him for different reasons but

696
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:10,160
he was a very jovial person. As I said he treated everyone fairly and equally. I remember one time

697
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:20,800
when I was in the back parking lot of the institute, Pauling was leaving the back door

698
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,160
and the janitor was arriving so it was after hours it was maybe 530 or 6 in the afternoon and the

699
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:31,200
janitor was quite away from the door. I'd say maybe a hundred feet from the door because janitor

700
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:37,519
tended to park at the far end of the parking lot and Pauling stood there holding the door open

701
01:15:37,519 --> 01:15:42,880
for probably three or four minutes while the janitor navigated this distance and came into the

702
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,159
building and then Pauling greeted him and then left the door and he was also holding a box because

703
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,679
he often used a box to ferry books and papers back and forth from the institute to his apartment

704
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,880
or ranch so he had something in his arm as well and stood there holding the door for the janitor

705
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:07,199
and I think that was kind of symbolic in a way of the way he treated people. He was just very

706
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:18,159
fair to everyone. Sometimes I think his excitement about scientific ideas that he would generate

707
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:26,560
an association with particular people caused him perhaps to overlook what some other people might

708
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:33,840
consider problematic issues and personalities and I think that this happened to him at least twice

709
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,800
in his later years at the institute and both times it resulted in personal clashes, very

710
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:49,039
unamicable departures of personnel from the institute and litigation which was very difficult,

711
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:55,200
expensive and painful for everyone involved but I think he was so excited by scientific talent that

712
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:00,800
he tended to overlook some personality characteristics from time to time but as I said he was a very

713
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:08,720
warm engaging person. I would go to birthday celebrations which occurred I think every five years

714
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:16,800
typically at hotel in San Francisco and there were other occasions at which visitors were

715
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:23,599
honored or the humanitarian award was given out or other awards were given out or Pauling was

716
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:32,960
an attendance for an award and he was always very charming and people were very happy to see him

717
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:42,960
and he always had a big smile and greeting for everyone. Well the birthday celebrations were

718
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:50,320
terrific. The last one I remember was at Stanford Court Hotel in San Francisco the Mistress of

719
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:58,880
Ceremonies was Rita Moreno and I believe she was approached by Rick Hicks to host that party because

720
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:06,319
she had gotten an Emmy, an OB, a Tony and an Academy Award so Rick thought it was

721
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:12,559
appropriate that someone who had been so honored in so many of the performing fields was hosting

722
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:17,039
an event for someone who had been so honored in so many medical and scientific and social fields

723
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:22,079
like Linus Pauling and she was a real firecracker and I think Linus Pauling really enjoyed listening

724
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:30,880
to her talk and he had a lot of his old friends there and it was it was always he always really enjoyed

725
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:37,680
interacting with old colleagues. We also had a 20th anniversary celebration of the Linus Pauling

726
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:43,199
Institute in 1993 at the Ringgstorf House which was a Victorian house that had been renovated

727
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,840
in the Saltmarsh area of Mountain View, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and that was an

728
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:55,760
opportunity to put on display a lot of Pauling's awards, medals, honorary degrees and also invite

729
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:03,119
supporters of the institute, institute staff and friends and some of Pauling's colleagues and

730
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,760
friends who were still in the Bay Area to come and see him and as it turned out it was probably

731
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,159
the last time that some of these people had an opportunity to meet him to see him again.

732
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:17,359
Owen Chamberlin was there, Harden McConnell from Stanford, chemistry department had been a long

733
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,920
friend of Pauling's and I think instrumental in bringing Pauling to Stanford back in 1969

734
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,840
was there Byron Brown from Biosatistics was there and there were a number of people that Pauling

735
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,279
had liked and associated with over the years that were there and it provided him an opportunity

736
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:40,000
to see them and greet them. He always had a lot of energy to meet people as well and

737
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:46,560
it a very interesting way of speaking. It was very characteristic and a very characteristic way

738
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,600
of moving as well both of which were captured quite realistically by John Aston when he performed

739
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:59,920
the part of Linus Pauling in the nature of the Marital Bond which was a play put on in association

740
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,359
when the Linus Pauling exhibition years ago.

741
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:12,239
What about that note? Outside of Boyd De�s and May the Hall we don't really have a good sense of

742
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:19,039
who Pauling's friends really were. He was calling on that on the tagging of the movies they were his friends.

743
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:26,159
Well he spent quite a lot of time of course with Rick Hicks and Emilsu Kukandall and I think

744
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:34,159
Rick really went out of his way to try to take care of Linus Pauling as well especially after

745
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:40,880
A. Valindyde really looked after his welfare and was interested in his personal health as well and

746
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,840
I think even tried to get Linus Pauling to exercise which is something that Pauling refused to do.

747
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:54,399
He talked quite often with Emilsu Kukandall mainly about administrative issues so with Rick Hicks

748
01:20:54,399 --> 01:21:01,759
and Emilsu Kukandall there was a lot of talk about administrative issues and these kinds of

749
01:21:01,759 --> 01:21:09,279
conversations went on for a decade or longer. He saw quite a lot of hardened McConnell who was someone

750
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:16,159
he could talk about chemistry with and Henry Talby as well at Stanford and Zellik Herman was

751
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:22,159
another person that was a colleague and an employee of the institute but someone that Pauling could talk

752
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:28,880
in a very meaningful detailed way in depth about theoretical chemistry and structural chemistry

753
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:36,639
and physics so Herman and Pauling co-authored quite a few papers during this period in 1970s through

754
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:44,319
the 1980s and up to the 1990s and I think Pauling relied on him to do a lot of the sort of the

755
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,599
heavy work in many of those papers so we spent a lot of time with Zellik Herman as well

756
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:57,279
and there were a lot of people that visited him who he'd known throughout his life

757
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:08,079
but he didn't really seem to have what I would call a strong social life. Of course if he was

758
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:13,519
entertaining people at his home in Porto Avali or at his apartment in Stanford I wouldn't necessarily

759
01:22:13,519 --> 01:22:19,439
have known about that. I mean I went to his home in Porto Avali a number of times he and his wife

760
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:27,199
used to host Christmas parties there and one of the last Christmas parties I went to there I think

761
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:36,639
was probably 1979. Avali and died in 1980 or 1981? 1981 so I believe that this was probably about

762
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:43,359
1979 and I remember thinking about the egg nod that Pauling made which was really extraordinary

763
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:52,399
good. He wasn't a chef but having a Nobel Prize winning chemist Nobel Prize winning chemist

764
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:59,039
make the egg nod and spike it with with a vodka was pretty extraordinary it was a really terrific

765
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:06,799
treat and he when he was with his wife was also very affectionate and I think people picked up on

766
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:14,720
that affection and responded to that as well. After his wife died of course there was no one

767
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:20,960
for him to be that affectionate with so he was a bit different in in social situations because he

768
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,279
didn't really have someone to to be affectionate with in those circumstances.

769
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:34,640
Do you have any other recollections that they'd at home? She was a really diminutive person she was

770
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:42,560
short she was very well spoken very articulate and I enjoyed speaking with her when I talked to her

771
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:48,800
several times she and I did not talk about science so much as we talked about other issues and

772
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:57,039
she as I found out later was particularly fond of their association with some of the celebrities

773
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:02,000
in in Los Angeles and Hollywood during the era in which Pauling was trying to educate them about

774
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:10,159
radioactive isotopes and nuclear weapons and so forth and engaged in peace activities as well

775
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:17,199
and we talked I think gave a hell and I talked about those things sometimes but typically she was

776
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,760
very close to her husband physically whenever they were in a social environment and he always

777
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:27,840
liked to steer the conversation to science so the conversation typically would would end up being

778
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,440
about science and not so much about some of the other activities. One other thing about Pauling

779
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:45,360
that I enjoyed was when I found out that he enjoyed reading mystery novels I also was a big fan

780
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:51,840
of Sherlock Holmes and not so much Agatha Christie but particularly Rex Stout and I asked him if he had

781
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,039
read all of Sherlock Holmes and Rex Stout and of course he had so there wasn't anything I could

782
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:02,079
loan him but there were other books that I was reading he was not familiar with one was called

783
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:08,960
the Red Right Hand by Joel Townsley Rogers which I think was written in 1939 or 1940 and it's a

784
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:15,279
real hard boiled great detective story and I loaned that to him and he really he loved that book very

785
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:21,199
much and he consequently loaned me books I would loan him books and he would he would loan me mystery

786
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:27,439
books as well that that he had finished reading it was very interesting and in one time he broke

787
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:34,079
from that orthodoxy and loaning me mystery novels and loaned me a book called Good Night Ava by Richard

788
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:42,079
Bissell and this was a 1950s pulp paperback with a painted cover and he said I think you'll enjoy this

789
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:47,599
and I got the book and I read it and it reminded me a little bit of Verscan Caldwell even Mark Twain

790
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:59,200
maybe and the cover of the book showed kind of a the sultry group sitting on a on a porch of a kind

791
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,600
of a ram shackle cabin probably in the banks of the Mississippi River and there were a couple of

792
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:11,920
guys lounging around looked like near-do wells and there was a woman's trimming guitar in not much

793
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:18,640
and she had her foot up on a pickle barrel or something and I thought it was amusing that he'd

794
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:24,880
loaned me this book and it was actually an amusing entertaining read as well and I gave it back to him

795
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,520
and when he when I gave it back to him his eyes kind of sparkled a bit and he said did you

796
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,600
notice anything particularly funny about the book and I said yes and both of us burst out laughing

797
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:44,160
he had taken a photograph of his wife and cut out her face and pasted it over the face of the

798
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:50,240
woman playing guitar on the cover of the book and I thought that was very funny very appropriate

799
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:57,200
since the book had Eva in the title as well you have that book I'm sure you do yeah

800
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:05,280
and he had a terrific sense of humor Zella Kerman likes to tell the story of the time that

801
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,560
he was standing at the urinal in the men's room at the Linus Pine Institute Science Medicine and

802
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,240
Linus Pine came in and stood next to him and looked over and said ah we meet his peers

803
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,400
so he was not prudish and of course Ken Hedberg has a very famous story of

804
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,160
when Ken was a graduate student Caltech and was looking through one of those little plastic

805
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:39,840
viewfinders of the woman O'Neal Turell in a stream standing on a rock or a boulder

806
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,519
he was holding this viewfinder up to the light and he heard Pauling's footsteps outside his

807
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:52,559
office and thought oh and Pauling came in and of course wanted to see what the viewfinder picture

808
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:58,800
was and he held the viewfinder up to the light and said ah the salt he identified the rock that

809
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,760
she was standing on so he had a great sense of humor and it would definitely was not prudish

810
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,440
just that I can briefly you mentioned me that Hela is talking about the connections that they

811
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:17,680
have with some of the Hollywood types do you call any individual which was particularly fun about

812
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:22,640
the women and stuff that no I don't but I remember there were a number of people who came to

813
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:31,440
the institute and also to some of Pauling's birthday events and other events such as Eddie

814
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:37,680
Albert I remember giving a tour to Eddie Albert and son Eddie Albert Jr. one time at the institute

815
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:47,760
and Carl Sagan came by one time for an event and there were a number of other

816
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:52,159
number of other people who escaped me right now who came through the institute one reason or another

817
01:28:53,760 --> 01:29:02,000
but those were I believe after Avalon had died so those were people who had continued to have

818
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,600
some title on his pond or the one's point institute but I don't recollect talking with her about

819
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:13,840
specific people Pauling by all it comes out of very difficult times feeling a bit of a homestead

820
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,480
wondering if you have memories of that time period and how that fit in itself

821
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:26,800
well as Erick Hall he was gone quite a lot after her death I think he took a trip to Oregon

822
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:34,079
and visited some of his old boyhood haunts his home maybe the semi-family cemetery maybe

823
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:42,560
went to Condon came here to Oregon State University he was perhaps didn't exhibit the same sort

824
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,680
of levity that that I was accustomed to seeing in him in other words he was spontaneously happy

825
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:57,360
in the late 1970s when I saw him he always seemed to be very happy and very carefree I think there

826
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:06,240
was a more somber demeanor that he exhibited after her death and a lot of the sort of levity

827
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:14,079
seemed to evaporate from his countenance at that time now that slowly returned over the course

828
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:21,840
of the 1980s and I'd say by the mid to late 1980s he seemed to be pretty much his old self in

829
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,559
terms of a good sense of humor but there was a period there when he didn't seem to be very happy

830
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:33,760
okay well we are at an hour and a half and another about half way through my questions

831
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,280
so I don't see a whole day through that yeah that's fine
