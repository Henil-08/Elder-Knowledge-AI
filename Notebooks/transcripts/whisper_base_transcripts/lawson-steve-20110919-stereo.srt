1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
that are replaceable. Okay we're done so we will have you check the volume level

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:19,839
level and we're okay good. My name is Stephen Lawson it's September 19th

3
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,440
2011 and we are in a room in the Valley Library on the campus of Oregon State

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,200
University. So this is the second of our interviews that is basically doing one

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,400
quality and personal characteristics and we want to do a lot of different things

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I'll ask when I want to start to say by talking about the Pauline family and the

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,880
interaction that you have with Pauline's children, you'd like to sell it here.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:55,440
Peter Pauline, I believe I met Peter probably in the late 1970s or early

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,920
1980s for the first time when he was visiting his father or his parents in

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,320
California from England. Very interesting fellow he was in a way the black sheep

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,920
of the family in terms of his personal habits he seemed to drink quite a lot

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,359
and was a smoker so I think that some of those habits had some health

13
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,560
consequences for him late in life but he was a very personable very direct

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,319
person with a good sense of humor I really enjoyed my interactions with him.

15
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:37,120
In the early 1990s I received a box addressed to me at the Linus Pauline Institute

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,800
of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto, California with no return address and no

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,160
letter inside but the box held what appeared to be Linus Pauline's chemistry

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,360
Nobel Prize medal and I was very perplexed by this I didn't know why it would

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,520
be sent to me who sent it except that the postmark was Europe from Europe so I

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,360
knew that it originated in Europe but I had no understanding of who sent it or why

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
and whether or not the medal was authentic I called up Henry Talbe who's a

22
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,759
Nobel Prize winner in chemistry at Stanford who was a good friend of Linus

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,439
Pauline's and I compared the medals and the the medal that I had got in the

24
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,400
male seemed to be authentic except for the fact that it seemed to be an

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:27,199
alloy rather than solid gold or gold plated whatever the actual medal is I put

26
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,719
it aside in my office and about a week and a half or two weeks later I received

27
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,560
a second package from Europe again no return address no correspondence this

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,400
time there was the Nobel Peace Prize medal inside the box so now I was really

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,680
stumped and very curious as to why these were being sent to me and who had sent

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,319
them and about a week or two after that second box had arrived I received a

31
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,680
phone call from Peter who was in England at the time and he asked me early on

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
in the conversation if I'd received anything unusual in the mail recently and I

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,480
said well yes Peter I have I received two replicas of your father's Nobel

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,360
prizes and he said oh good I'm glad you got those he very graciously had gone

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,200
to the academies and had duplicate medals struck in an alloy for family members

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,840
and for the Linus Pauline Institute of Science and Medicine which I thought was

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,400
very nice of him and I think he had that done well it was around the time of

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,360
his father's death I don't recall if it was before or after but it was right

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:43,199
around that era when he did that I never really had a chance to talk to Peter

40
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,199
about his scientific work or his work in on chemical structure we did talk

41
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,639
occasionally about the vitamin C in cancer work that Pauline was doing in

42
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,359
collaboration with you and Cameron and Scott one and Peter was very interested in

43
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,919
that work of course although I don't know that he actually communicated much

44
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,799
with you and Cameron even though they wasn't the same island there off Europe

45
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:22,439
Linda Pauline I've known for quite a long time I think I met her either a party

46
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,360
at her parents house in Portola Valley or perhaps at the Linus Plain Institute

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,600
of Science and Medicine in Memo Park she's a very nice person like I said I've

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
known her for a very long time and I knew her husband I think perhaps before I

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,240
met her because her husband would visit the Linus Pauline Institute in Palo Alto

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,600
occasionally to talk with his father and law Linus Pauline because they had

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,879
jointly authored papers in theoretical physics and chemistry and Barkley was

52
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,240
a very interesting person and I remember asking him to explain one of the

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,680
papers to me that he co-authored with Linus Pauline and he said he was stumped by

54
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,439
it which is a very amusing I got to know Linda a little bit better when the

55
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,280
Linus Plain exhibition was being planned because we both served on the advisory

56
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,800
committee so we were meeting together with family members and other people from

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,960
the scientific community and Soka Gakai quite often to both plan the Linus

58
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,720
Plain exhibition and at the different venues at which you convened so I did get

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:33,720
to know her her pretty well and I remember when we moved files from the

60
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Linus Plain Institute of Science and Medicine here to Oregon State University

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,480
many of the files from Pauline's office were moved to Wendell-Gurhal before

62
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,520
they were transferred to special collections and I was looking through some of

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,200
those files for one reason or another and I came across a letter from

64
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,199
Richard Feynman Nobel Prize winner at Caltech to Linus Pauline

65
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,360
apparently in response to a letter that Pauline had sent to him earlier because

66
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,519
the earlier letter was referenced in the response from Feynman to Pauline and

67
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,399
Feynman at that time had been diagnosed with an often fatal disease and I think

68
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,480
Linus Pauline had written to him suggesting that high dose vitamin C may have

69
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,040
some value and apparently in the earlier letter that Pauline sent to Feynman

70
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,000
he had enclosed some reprints of papers that he and Cameron had written on

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,840
vitamin C in cancer explaining host resistance and stimulation of the immune

72
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,680
system and so forth so Feynman had written back to Pauline thanking him for

73
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,600
providing all this information to him and mentioning that he was going to share

74
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,800
this with his physician and then I think in a separate paragraph he he started

75
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,400
an impair phrasing that he was been thinking about Pauline's long career

76
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,840
very productive career and all the major contributions that he had made to

77
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
science and humanity and he closed by saying something quite clever and

78
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,240
funny he said no Linus I'm thinking about all your achievements and the

79
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
wonderful things you've done for society but I think your greatest achievement

80
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,280
your greatest contribution has been your daughter Linda I thought that was quite

81
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:24,479
funny you recall any conversation he had with children and then reflecting back

82
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,919
on that dance at all talking about them and what was like to be at Pauline

83
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:41,679
not really I think when I was engaged with Crowlin Linda or Peter particularly we

84
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:46,359
were either in social settings in which there were a lot of people involved so it

85
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,840
wasn't easy to have a protracted conversation or they were meetings in which

86
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,000
we had specific strategic goals and we talked about various businesses or

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,199
relationships or so forth but I never asked any questions about family history of

88
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,240
any of the children actually even though I had many opportunities it just never

89
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,639
occurred to me to delve into their personal relationships with their parents

90
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,800
maybe I felt it was a little improper for me to do so

91
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,879
so Crowlin I had known Crowlin for quite a long time he came by the Institute

92
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,919
as did all the children from time to time so I would see them although I didn't

93
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:37,879
communicate much with him Crowlin became more active with the Institute as his

94
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,519
father's illness progressed and as we were struggling with future options for

95
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,319
the Institute and he was also the executor I believe of his father's will and

96
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:52,240
some of the elements of that will affected the Linus Piling Institute of Science

97
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,720
Medicine so one thing that I discussed with Crowlin in great detail and we

98
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,480
communicated about many times both Orlean and writing concern royalties to

99
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
some of Linus Piling's books because Pauline had written for instance how to

100
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
live longer and feel better as an employee of the Linus Piling Institute of

101
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Science and Medicine and he had directed that out all royalties and revenue from

102
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:25,519
that book be given to the Linus Piling Institute and when it came time to tie up

103
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,399
some loose ends concerning the Linus Piling Institute of Science and Medicine I

104
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,960
was interested in whether that same principle would apply to some of Pauline's

105
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,519
other books in particular vitamin C in the common cold or vitamin C in

106
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,160
cancer which of course again was written as an employee of the Linus Piling

107
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,000
Institute of Science and Medicine so Crowlin and I discussed those issues

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,200
several times and he seemed to be very amenable to reason which I thought was

109
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,960
great

110
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:03,720
Linus Piling Jr. I enjoy Linus Piling

111
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,920
Jr. very much and of all the children I've worked most closely with him and I

112
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,080
think I probably know him best of all the children I had seen him from time to

113
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,200
time when he came to California to participate in trustees meetings because I

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,040
believe he's been on the Board of Trustees of the Linus Piling Institute of

115
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Science and Medicine excuse me probably since its inception and periodic

116
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,560
board meetings were held over the years and I would see him but I never really

117
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:38,839
met him until the institute was reorganized in the early 1990s and there was a

118
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,159
desire I think on the part of the Board and on the part of Linus Piling

119
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,439
Jr. to spare his father from some of the administrative responsibilities and

120
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:53,359
tasks associated with running the Institute on a day-to-day basis and let him

121
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:58,399
concentrate on research which really is what he wanted to do and since time

122
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,379
was becoming more precious everyone felt that that's what he should do what he

123
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:07,539
wanted to do which was to focus on science so I talked with Linus Piling

124
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:12,019
Jr. after I was asked by the Board to become executive officer and then later

125
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,759
chief executive officer of the Linus Piling Institute of Science and Medicine and

126
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,319
Linus Jr. became chairman of the Board of Trustees he and I worked very closely

127
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:27,159
together for several years and communicated very often about financial

128
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:35,519
personnel management issues at the Institute in particular there was the

129
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,879
possibility that the former president director of the Institute I am Ylzukukondl

130
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,039
would start a new institute called the Institute of Medical Molecular Sciences

131
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,719
and that we would subly space in the building at 440 Page Mill Road to IMMMS and

132
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:56,759
that was a very complicated and somewhat controversial and divisive issue and

133
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,740
Linus Piling Jr. and Linus Piling had asked me along with a couple of the

134
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,980
people at the Linus Piling Institute of Science and Medicine to analyze this

135
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,439
possibility and report as to whether or not it would work practically and if

136
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:16,039
so how we would manage that that sublease and sharing of the physical space in

137
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,120
the building so I worked very closely with Linus Piling Jr. during that period and

138
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,960
then of course in trying to stabilize the finances of the Institute which

139
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,240
were always teetering in those days and worked with him closely on public

140
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,360
relations and kind of marketing of the Institute and later very closely on

141
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,720
trying to identify options for the future of the Institute because with

142
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,639
Linus Piling's demise and the problems that confronted us in Palo Alto was not

143
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,440
certain that the Linus Piling could carry on as a viable research organization

144
00:12:51,440 --> 00:13:00,360
or even if that was the ideal option for the future. So we spent many hours

145
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,680
in days analyzing and debating what the right future for the Institute might be

146
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:15,080
and eventually decided that keeping the Orthon Molecular Medical Mission as a

147
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,800
lasting legacy to Linus Piling's work in Orthon Molecular Medicine which is why

148
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,399
the Institute was founded in the first place would be the most appropriate

149
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,439
future for the Institute so Linus Piling Jr. and I set about trying to identify as

150
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:33,000
I said options for relocation.

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,500
You mentioned Barclay Cam when they had their other people with other

152
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,639
extended Cam family or any other colleagues out there that you had contact with?

153
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,639
Yes. Barclay Cam's son, Barclay Cam Jr. I believe.

154
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,960
My column Barkey is a partner at Cooley Godward in Palo Alto and his wife was

155
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,379
asked to become a trustee of the Linus Piling Institute of Science and Medicine

156
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:05,199
back after the reorganization in the early 1990s and we had quite a few

157
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:12,759
onerous legal issues to deal with at the time and Barclay being part of that

158
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,519
law firm that we hired to provide legal counsel and advice was very helpful

159
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,360
to the Institute and I talked with him many times at that time and of course I

160
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,960
saw him socially as well.

161
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,200
I don't believe that I had much interaction with the other extended members of

162
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,519
the family. At about the time of Pauling's death before he died and after he died

163
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,559
there were of course many visits from extended families, Linus Piling Jr.'s

164
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:48,119
family, Linus family and others and I met many of the the grandchildren and

165
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:52,359
children and so forth but I can't say that I really had very meaningful conversations

166
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,559
with any of them.

167
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,399
You brought something up that I hadn't thought to ask about but it makes perfect sense to

168
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,079
it and I guess you had a pretty prospective on the transfer of point

169
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,160
and the members from the F.

170
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
He's in a lot of the work at the O.D. offices.

171
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,360
Yes.

172
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,520
Do you have any questions on your hand?

173
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,600
Yeah it was very interesting. I've always been in favor of transparency and

174
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,400
access and I thought that I've always thought that access to Pauling's papers and

175
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,560
memorabilia should be encouraged for scholarship because there's a lot to

176
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,560
learn there and I think the more people look into Pauling's career and activities

177
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,200
the more interesting and astonishing it becomes. It's really a multi-faceted

178
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,720
project although I didn't have some concerns initially about

179
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
when I learned that the intent of special collections which I think is a good

180
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,160
one was to make Pauling's papers available online.

181
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,320
It struck me as a really terrific project especially the scientific papers,

182
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,120
the research notebooks and so forth but I was concerned about the correspondence

183
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,800
being scanned and made available online for a couple of reasons.

184
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,719
One, many people would write to Pauling

185
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:12,079
with asking for advice on medical issues. They had cancer, they had various

186
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,639
disease, they had a friend or relative or a colleague with disease and they

187
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,879
wanted to know how much vitamin C to take or what other therapies might be

188
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,719
appropriate to treat this particular disease and sometimes they would include

189
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:28,959
a donation and typically the way these donations were processed the

190
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,639
photocopy of the check might be made and then stapled some of the

191
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,360
correspondence. So I was concerned that there needed to be some

192
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,920
judicious oversight in the way material was scanned and made available online

193
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,360
because medical conditions confidential medical and financial information

194
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
related to some of Pauling's correspondence. I didn't feel it should be released

195
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:02,240
to the public so I was a little hesitant in

196
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,279
making that material available to Oregon State University until special

197
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,200
collections had come up with some sort of strategy to screen that material to

198
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,400
protect those confidential issues of people that had written to Pauling over

199
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,360
the years and never suspected that their letters or

200
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
information would be publicly available on the internet.

201
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Partly because the internet hadn't existed when they wrote and

202
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,839
for other reasons. Many of Pauling's

203
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,160
files, his manuscripts, a lot of the scientific work, his correspondence were

204
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,600
maintained by Dorothy and Monroe at the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and

205
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,880
Medicine. So of course those files were under our control for many years and

206
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
then I worked with you and with Cliff Mead as well who was a director of special

207
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,640
collections at that time to ensure that that this material got transferred to

208
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,759
special collections. Although in many cases everything was moved

209
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,880
in one project by a moving company from the 440 Page Mill

210
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,000
road address in Palo Alto to the campus of Oregon State University and to

211
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,960
simplify things almost everything in that move went to our area and went

212
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,960
into our hall and was stored in various rooms and then from time to time those

213
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
files and filing cabinets and materials were then transferred to special

214
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,640
collections. I'm interested in and I think they're about

215
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
the chalkboard. Do you have memories of falling piece of that board and then now

216
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,200
how would you store it? I do have some memories of that. The green board that was

217
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
in his office, he seldom erased from it. Sometimes he inadvertently erased

218
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,839
things because he would move too closely or a guest in the office would move too

219
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,640
closely to the board and their their code or shirt would inadvertently erase

220
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,880
some of the writing on the board. I once asked Dorothy Monroe maybe out of

221
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,039
vanity why my name wasn't on the board because I noticed that the names of

222
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,880
some of the institute employees were on the board and I was curious as to why

223
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
my name wasn't and he said well that's because he knows you so well. He

224
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,200
doesn't need to have your name on the board as a monomic device because

225
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,559
sometimes for people that he didn't interact with regularly to associate the

226
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,680
name on the board with the person when they came into his office was very

227
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,799
useful to him and the entrance to his office was adjacent to that green board so

228
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,599
it could very easily look from the person to the board and back and and attach

229
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,960
the name to the to the person that was standing in front of him if he was

230
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,360
unclear as to who that person might be. I think Cliff Mead the former director of

231
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,160
Special Collections managed the technical aspects of moving the chalk board. I

232
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,279
know that there were issues about electrostatic

233
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,240
disilligment of the chalk particles from the board if different types of acrylic were used and

234
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,600
there was discussion about spraying the board with some sort of sealant that would forever

235
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:11,279
fix the chalk to the board but whatever technique was used and I believe a box was

236
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,839
built around the board and it was moved very carefully they didn't have

237
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,959
standing job because as far as I can tell there was no loss of information and

238
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:22,399
when the board was moved from Pong's office to special collections.

239
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,279
Something else getting away from calling a little bit here but something else

240
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,759
that you referenced that I wanted to about it to travel into the New York window and

241
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:47,440
it's the SGI exhibit. Yeah. Well I think that the origin for that exhibit probably goes back to

242
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,039
I know Dasaka Akeda the head of SGI in line is pulling head met in

243
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:01,440
conversed prior to the establishment of the Linus Plain Expression so they were acquaintances and

244
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:09,279
I think SGI or Akeda had expressed a desire to do something for Linus Pong or the Linus

245
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,879
Plain Institute of Science and Medicine and I think although I'm not exactly clear on this my

246
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,960
recollection I hadn't thought about this in a while and I hadn't consulted any files but I think

247
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,720
that the I think that desire was transformed into the exhibition partly due to conversations

248
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:35,920
perhaps with Linus Pong Jr. in the early 1990s and then of course we thought it would be a way

249
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,440
of educating the public about this extraordinary man and introducing school children to Linus Pong

250
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,640
as a role model perhaps because Linus Pong worked in chemistry and chemistry is not

251
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,280
that sexy as subject to many citizens in the United States cosmology theoretical physics things

252
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,800
like that things that Einstein was involved in or Carl Sagan was involved and seemed to resonate

253
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,200
with people but chemistry is a little bit difficult a little bit oblique to many people so

254
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,680
we thought that having an exhibition devoted to Linus Pong and all facets of his career as a

255
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:18,960
humanitarian as an activist as a scientist as a medical researcher would be a way of honoring

256
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,920
Linus Pong his legacy and also introducing his incredible work to school children and people

257
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:34,000
around the world it was hugely successful millions of people saw it in locations in Europe and Japan

258
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,759
and many locations in the United States it was terrifically well executed and designed very

259
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:49,119
very diligent and creative design people working with Soka Gakai transformed the exhibit or designed

260
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:55,680
the exhibit to fit into the available spaces in DC and San Francisco and Boston and everyone who

261
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,200
who saw the exhibit really thought it was very very impressive and actually Soka Gakai

262
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,640
when the exhibit had finished touring gave all the elements of the Linus Pong exhibition to Oregon State

263
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,640
University. Okay you seem very deploying a little bit I'm wondering if you ever go to Dear Flat Ranch?

264
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,279
I did I went down to Dear Flat Ranch they had a little guest house that was built I think at the

265
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:33,119
south end of the beach adjacent to the main house and I went down fairly late in Pauling's life I

266
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:41,839
think it must have been around 1993 perhaps even 1994 when I went there and my visit was associated

267
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,279
with a deposition that our attorneys were doing of Linus Pong related to litigation with health

268
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,200
now in Matthias Rat and I remember driving down and taking him the Sunday paper because I know

269
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,360
that he always liked to read the Sunday San Francisco Chronicle and the funny so I took him that

270
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,000
large paper and visited him at Dear Flat Ranch and got to see the house and wandered around the

271
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,759
beach and it was very very enjoyable and it was a little sad too because it was difficult to see him

272
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,200
somewhat incapacitated but it was really a terrific experience to be there. So I'm trying to get a

273
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,279
sense of the space here and it was very important for me to find.

274
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,480
And it was easy to see why it was so important to him because it was very remote and secluded.

275
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,000
There were no distractions a terrific natural environment in a house perched on a bluff over

276
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,880
looking the ocean very tranquil space and I think it's easy to see how we got a lot done there

277
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,000
without any internet connection or fax. I believe it might have installed a fax machine later on but

278
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,480
I was an ideal place for him to work and think without distractions because when he was in Palo Alto

279
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,360
he was a very famous man and his time was sought by many people for many different reasons. Old

280
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,400
friends, colleagues, the public, the media and I think it was difficult for him to concentrate at his

281
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,840
office at the Linus Plain Institute of Science and Medicine at least on Page Mill Road because

282
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,080
there were so many demands on his time when he retreated to dear flat ranch. He removed himself from

283
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,800
that contact, that connection so he was I think he really loved that time alone down there.

284
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,240
I believe the property is still owned by the family but I'm not exactly sure what they intend to do with it.

285
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,640
You don't have a good sense of what only gives the fun and the ideas on that regard.

286
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:54,640
Well I know that he'd like to watch some programs on TV, some serialized programs. He read quite a lot.

287
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
He loved to read mystery books and I think we may have talked about that in our earlier conversation.

288
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,519
I would loan him mystery books and he would loan me books and actually a lot of his books

289
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:12,559
before he died ended up at a bookstore in California Avenue in Palo Alto because he would stop in

290
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,000
that bookstore and trade books. It was a bookstore where you could trade or sell your used books for

291
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,359
books that they had in stock. So I remember looking through the bookstore and finding Linus Plain's

292
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,879
name and many of the books, the mystery and science fiction area that he had brought into trade for

293
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,080
other books that he was interested in reading. He didn't seem to have much interest in cinema,

294
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:49,200
in plays, in show business arts, fine art, music. I didn't seem to be anything that came up

295
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,080
very often in conversation so he did not really seek out those kinds of experiences. I think he

296
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:01,039
was happiest just doing his own work thinking about scientific problems. The few times that I

297
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,799
had cocktails with him and as a partner at Stanford, he was happy to sit and talk about a wide range

298
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:17,519
of things and he liked to drink vodka and we would typically have vodka and tonic. Sometimes he

299
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:24,559
would just drink straight up vodka or maybe with water and talk about a wide range of subjects. But

300
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:36,079
popular culture, the arts were really not, I don't think, of great interest to him. So he was a

301
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:42,480
rare individual in that there was really no division between, in my mind, what he did recreationally

302
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,720
and what he did professionally. I mean he was a scientist through and through and derived pleasure

303
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,279
from working on scientific problems and that pleasure I don't think was to be substituted for

304
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,839
pleasure and other activities. I'm sure that he did a lot of things on his own or with his wife

305
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,640
traveling and so forth and visiting different places with his wife that were enjoyable to him but

306
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,880
when I knew him best, late in life after his wife had died, it didn't seem that he was that engaged

307
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:24,880
in activities other than science. Okay, well I have a little list of personality characteristics that

308
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,400
are often assigned to calling out and looking at the reflectance and the first to be his work ethic.

309
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,519
Oh he was very industrious, very industrious. He worked all the time. As a matter of fact,

310
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,480
I remember going to parties that has some portola valley and using the restroom, the bathroom.

311
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,640
And oftentimes if you go into someone's bathroom you'll find a prevention magazine,

312
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,280
a reader's digest or entertainment weekly or time or the newspaper or something and Pauling's

313
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,240
bathroom was stack of journals, scientific journals.

314
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,839
Creativity? Well I think it goes without saying that he was extraordinarily creative and had an

315
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:13,680
interesting way of visualizing and thinking about scientific problems and issues so I think in

316
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,359
terms of creativity I can't think that at least in the scientific realm that he's surpassed by

317
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,359
anyone really. When you think about the nature of his stunning contributions to molecular medicine,

318
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,479
molecular biology, chemical bond, I don't think it gets much more creative than that.

319
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,479
And many people talk about his memory. His memory was prodigious. It's rare that you encounter

320
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:46,559
someone who has such a clear memory of so many details and Pauling was very frequently able to

321
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:53,919
recite the co-authors of papers that had been published, not just his own papers, but other papers

322
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,759
that had been published 30, 40 years earlier in the date and the journal and basically could give

323
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,519
you an abstract of that particular paper. So he had an incredible memory and I think that is

324
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:12,480
one of the reasons he was able to make so much progress in science. He was able to conjure facts

325
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,120
from deep in his memory about perhaps unrelated topics and fit them together in a real synergistic way

326
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:28,960
and make new discoveries. But I have felt my father also had a stunning memory. I won't say it was

327
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,799
photographic but it was close to being photographic. He was able, laid in life to remember things that

328
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,000
he had learned as an undergraduate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology that I found very surprising.

329
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,640
I would try to stump him with calculus problems when he was a businessman and he was not stop not

330
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,279
stumpable and Pauling was very similar, perhaps even better than my father on the memory score.

331
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,240
Well I think Linus Pauling had a healthy ego. I think he was well aware of his abilities.

332
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,200
Some people I think misinterpret that confidence in his own abilities as arrogance and I never

333
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,279
really interpreted that way. It seemed to me that he knew what he was talking about. He was able to

334
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:27,839
justify his opinion or his statements about various issues which he was talking and I think he

335
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:43,119
had a very healthy ego. Did you ever see him angry? Let's see. I'm not sure that I ever saw him angry.

336
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:50,959
I saw him when he was less than happy but I'm not sure that that would qualify as angry.

337
00:31:51,440 --> 00:32:02,160
I've seen him concerned and maybe sad but not really angry. Although I'm sure he could,

338
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,360
for instance during the Mayo Clinic in Brolio in the late 1970s and mid 1980s he had every right to be very angry

339
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,000
and perhaps he expressed his anger to some of the participants in that controversy but I never saw him angry.

340
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:31,039
He tended to move somewhat slowly. Sometimes that was because he was carrying a heavy box with him

341
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:40,000
with correspondence and books and papers. So he never really seemed to be fatigued. He wasn't

342
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,200
physically vigorous. At the time I knew him at the Linus Point Institute of Science and Medicine but

343
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,880
he certainly didn't seem fatigued but he was not physically dynamic person.

344
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,559
How did he handle disappointment? There were a lot of grand applications between the

345
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,759
Molyton and the Times Institute and the Funded University of New York University.

346
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,480
Yeah I think he was disappointed clearly and all the emotions that go along would be

347
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:18,400
disappointed but he never felt dejected because I think he felt that he knew better than many of

348
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,120
the people who were denying him the grant funds and knew what was required to participate in the

349
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,039
grant funding game and was playing it and he was disappointed that he wasn't rewarded by playing

350
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,839
the game appropriately and the way he'd been told to play it by the funding agencies. So he was

351
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,679
somewhat chagrin that he couldn't get the money from federal agencies to do the kind of research

352
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:52,319
that he felt was very important. I didn't see him angry at particular people but he was unhappy

353
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,720
that he couldn't get financial support to do work that he felt would be very important in public

354
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,480
health. For instance the Vitamin C in Cancer work is a case in point. When Cameron had started

355
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,719
treating terminal cancer patients hospitalized waiting to die with high dose intravenous and

356
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:14,320
oral Vitamin C and reported to Pauline that some of these people were having very dramatic responses.

357
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,280
Pauline and Cameron collected a lot of the data pathology, histology, x-rays, so forth

358
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,119
and Pauline felt that that data was probably persuasive enough to get the National Cancer Institute

359
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,559
to set up randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy of Vitamin

360
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:42,239
C in Cancer. Learn more about it and the reception he got by the NCI was very negative and they always

361
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,839
found a reason that maybe Vitamin C wasn't responsible for this response. Maybe it was coincident

362
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,119
with something else and Pauline said well that's exactly why I want these clinical trials to be

363
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,480
carried out to find out whether this has value and it totally we have evidence that has value.

364
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:06,639
Now we need to find out whether it does truly have value and NCI had sort of an odd perspective

365
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:15,199
on the problem. They wanted Pauline to apply for funds to study this in cell cultures and animals,

366
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:21,360
animal models like mice or rats. So Cameron already had some clinical evidence but they wanted to

367
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:28,000
turn the wheelbarrow upside down and start with cell cultures and animals so typically the trajectory,

368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,039
the normal scientific trajectory would be to establish biological plausibility and see effects

369
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,880
in cell culture models and then move on into animal models to find out if you can replicate the

370
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,719
in vitro results in an in vivo model and then if that's all promising then you move eventually

371
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:54,559
into a clinical translation of this of this modality. And Pauline and Cameron were actually

372
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:02,559
starting at the end of that tripartate paradigm and he wasn't anxious to go back and start with

373
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:09,039
cell cultures and animals. So it was I think I'm sorry a bit frustrating to him and to

374
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,320
line to you and Cameron that they were reinforced to to start at the beginning when they already had

375
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,799
results in people that seemed to be very promising and they believed would be sufficient to set up

376
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:30,800
a randomized clinical trial to test this in people. Were you at all privy to or involved or

377
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,920
observed to Robert Perrydowke's collaboration with Pauline in development of the medical biodegrad?

378
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,400
Well Robert Perrydowke of course visited the institute many times because he was Pauline's

379
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,480
official biographer. So he came to talk with Pauline, talk with Dorothy Monroe, talk with people

380
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,760
calling colleagues at the institute and elsewhere many many times over the years and I got to know

381
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,599
him reasonably well. I never had much input there. I believe I may have spoken to him in the 1990s

382
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,159
about some of the litigation and Robinson and Rath issues.

383
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,320
I really don't know the status of the biography. I have no idea.

384
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,640
I wish a grin to learn at one point that he had no book contract and it seems to me that if

385
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,480
you have a book contract and that implies a deadline and you've got to you've got to have a

386
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:36,080
product by a certain date that the publisher is interested in producing and I was surprised to

387
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,240
find that apparently Robert Perrydowke never had a book contract and was doing this presumably

388
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,000
in hopes of shopping and around to different publishers at some later date but I think a book

389
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,320
contract would have really been a terrific catalyst to getting that project completed.

390
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,960
Tom Hager I talked with him and I like his book very much actually. I think it's probably the

391
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,079
best biography of Linus Pauline and Tom of course had some access to Pauline,

392
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,880
Lateness career and visited the institute several times and I was interested in I thought that the

393
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:21,039
last chapter in the end of the book to coincide with the end of Pauline's life was perhaps a

394
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:28,160
little bit abrupt and it was interested in working with Tom to develop that a little bit more

395
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,360
thoroughly especially with respect to the Rath litigation but I think the publisher was interested in

396
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,720
getting the book on the shelves, excuse me not long after Linus Pauline's death in August of 1994

397
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:46,399
and I think the book appeared in the fall of 1994 so I think that they were interested in wrapping

398
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:52,079
it up and getting it out there to sell while Pauline was still in recent memory in the news

399
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:58,319
because that would have been a good marketing opportunity for them and I have since talked with Tom

400
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,959
although I don't know if he has any desire to do this or is publisher as any desire to do this

401
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:08,639
in perhaps a new edition of this book which would wrap up some of the loose ends that were left

402
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:19,279
dangling in the original book. No I didn't know that. Not very interesting.

403
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,920
No, no I never had any contact as far as I can remember with Seraphini or the Gertzels.

404
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:37,199
I read their books, I thought they were interesting I mean I think no book is perfect and all have some

405
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,079
failures or defects and I think those two books have their share of failures and defects but

406
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,119
um what if Pauline used no media in here in France?

407
00:39:53,519 --> 00:40:02,159
Well I think Pauline as a result of his campaign to end atmospheric testing on nuclear weapons

408
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,559
and his political activities in the 1950s, learned pretty well how to use the media and

409
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,480
I was struck by his facility with the media. I mean he gave hundreds or thousands of interviews

410
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,799
to journalists and media representatives throughout his life and he knew what the audience was

411
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:30,879
and he knew what part of the story to give to the particular interviewer for that particular

412
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,000
audience and he was extremely good at describing pretty complex scientific phenomena in ways that

413
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,599
perhaps the average intelligent person can understand and grasp them. So he was a terrific speaker

414
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:52,720
and was able to distill pretty complicated ideas down to easily digestible um communications.

415
00:40:52,719 --> 00:41:01,839
Could the institute see I mean were there an institute that you remember were falling

416
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,639
gave it and in a view in a major publication it means to sign a pretty quick windfall from that.

417
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:13,439
Oh what? A pretty quick windfall or a bump in the amount of correspondence you received in that?

418
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:18,480
Yeah that's interesting well of course during the male clinic in Broly-O there was quite a lot of

419
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,519
communication between the public and the institute and Linus Pauling because at that time

420
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,679
although Cameron and Pauling pointed out that Craig and Martell who organized and carried out

421
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:35,039
that male clinic those male clinic studies two of which were published had not really read

422
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,880
Cameron or Pauling's papers and were not prepared to reproduce Cameron's work technically.

423
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,840
So they never gave any vitamin C intravenous land there were other problems with male clinic

424
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,280
studies that have been dealt with at length by other people.

425
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,519
So when people heard that the famous male clinic had apparently objectively evaluated

426
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,480
high dose vitamin C in cancer and came up with negative findings there was kind of a flood of

427
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,519
questions about this and Pauling and Cameron had prepared criticisms of the male clinic studies

428
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:19,679
and those were provided to people who were interested. I think that the only I can't remember

429
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,400
exactly big windfalls financial windfalls to the institute from the direct male program as a

430
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,800
result of public statements by Linus Pauling or other people at the Linus Plains Institute of

431
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,440
Science and Medicine but I do remember that there were negative consequences from both the male

432
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,920
clinic studies and somewhat later when people discovered that the institute was doing work on HIV

433
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:53,679
not AIDS but HIV infection, cell culture work and the effect of vitamin C in inhibiting replication

434
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,519
of the virus responsible for AIDS there were people that had moral problems with that work for whatever

435
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,760
reason and some donations dropped off as a result of that.

436
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,960
What do you hear the sense of Pauling's attitude towards the money especially in his

437
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:23,920
middle of life? Well, he's an assembly user pretty well the guy that is later used to do that.

438
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,639
Yeah I don't think money was an issue for him at least during the time I knew him on the latter

439
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:37,519
or third of his life. I feel fairly confident in saying that he didn't have any personal money

440
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:43,920
problems. He loaned money to the institute many times, directed royalties from books to come to

441
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,400
the institute so if he had needed money personally I don't think he would have done that for instance.

442
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,679
So to me he seemed like a very generous person financially. He was giving money to the institute,

443
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,319
he was trying to find money for the institute to carry out research that he felt was important.

444
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:06,639
So he seemed to be very generous and altruistic. He never seemed to be interested in

445
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:13,519
doing anything that would raise money for him. For instance the patents that he was involved

446
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,879
in acquiring weight in life, one in superconductivity and then patents related to lipo protein A and

447
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:26,559
vitamin C. I think the goal there was not to enrich himself but to find more revenue streams for

448
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,360
the institute so that it could do research that he felt was important. So I would say that's

449
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,599
very philanthropic attitude, very altruistic.

450
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,279
Did you have a travel inform? Let's see.

451
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:58,400
No, I guess I didn't. I traveled with him to City Hall in Palo Alto from his apartment and I

452
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,440
would often chauffeur him from his apartment at Stanford campus to the Linus Poly Institute

453
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,960
and take him home in the evening mainly because although his driver's license was still valid he

454
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,400
had decided not to drive so much anymore and it gave me an opportunity to talk with him about

455
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,240
scientific issues and administrative issues and he could regale me with stories from his past and

456
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,360
kind of a distraction free environment namely in the car while I was driving so but that's the

457
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:36,000
extent of my travel with him, local travel. Well in the early 90s he developed the illness that

458
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,400
would eventually take a while to try to treat up with an experimental treatment.

459
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,920
You know what you thought about that? Well when he went public with the diagnosis of prostate cancer

460
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,720
of course many people were shocked especially as critics. They weren't shocked I think they were

461
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,079
well I don't want to be too too critical of them but many people said we've been advocating

462
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,079
vitamin C for all these years and taking vitamin C for all these years and now you've got cancer

463
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,000
how do you explain that? And probably had a very rational non-defensive response which was

464
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:20,960
most elderly men develop hyperplastic or hyperplasia in their prostate most elderly men at autopsy

465
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:28,239
are found to have cancerous cells in their prostate and it's just not uncommon it happens to many

466
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:34,159
many elderly men and he said it's quite likely although not provable and I'm paraphrasing

467
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,119
that his high intake of vitamin C delayed the inevitable by 20 years and more because he died

468
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:45,199
at the age of 93 and a half and of course many men start to develop prostate problems 20 years

469
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,399
earlier than that so it's not a provable assertion but I think it's just as reasonable as any

470
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:58,480
other assertion about the relationship of vitamin C to his cancer. He treated himself both with

471
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:06,159
high dose vitamin C although I believe he did not take intravenous vitamin C perhaps just oral

472
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,679
vitamin C which is a little surprising but on the other hand the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C had

473
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:18,400
not been really clearly worked out and this was before the vitamin C transporters had been discovered

474
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,480
so no one really knew exactly how vitamin C got from the gastrointestinal track into the blood

475
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,679
stream into cells and tissues. It's clear that not all of it got into the blood stream from a large

476
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,920
ingested dose. Some was excreted, some that got absorbed was excreted and some just passed through

477
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,159
the intestinal track so the the pharmacokinetics were not well understood and it wasn't until after

478
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,880
applying died that that people started to to look into that more carefully and we now know for

479
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,800
instance that there are active transport molecules on cells in the intestine that limit the amount

480
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,160
of vitamin C that gets taken up by cells and moved from intestine into the blood stream. So when you

481
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,480
take large oral doses you cannot get the same blood concentration of vitamin C that you can get when

482
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,920
you get it intravenously because then you bypass these transporters on cells and get the vitamin C

483
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,960
directly into the blood stream. And some work actually a lot of work suggests that one of the major

484
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:24,320
anti-cancer mechanisms of high dose vitamin C is the generation of hydrogen peroxide as a result of

485
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:31,280
either auto-oxidation of vitamin C or reactions of vitamin C with metals and this seems to be selective

486
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,639
to tumor cells and hydrogen peroxide diffuses into the tumor cells and disrupts their cellular

487
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,800
machinery by different mechanisms. That wasn't really well known when Pauline was self-medicating with

488
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,760
vitamin C for his prostate cancer so he didn't prefer intravenous vitamin C at that point because

489
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,840
it wasn't any perhaps clear rationale for it. I know that he had surgery, he underwent a bilateral

490
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:02,560
orchiectomy and also was taken flutamide which is a standard chemotherapy drug for prostate cancer

491
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:09,600
and I know that he was also working with friends and colleagues at Stanford Medical School to raise

492
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,279
monoclonal antibodies against his prostate cancer cells and I don't really know

493
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,839
how those things work sequentially or whether he was combining some of those modalities. I'm not

494
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,440
clear about that but I know that all those avenues were tried by him

495
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,480
and he was actually quite public about his treatment and about his illness.

496
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,079
But if you recall the last time you saw him, I guess not.

497
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,199
I believe the last time I saw him was when he was deposed by our lawyers in 1994.

498
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:53,840
I think it was early summer, late spring or early summer of 1994 at his home in dear flat ranch.

499
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,360
What is your, what is your, what are your, that makes a fist meal?

500
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,039
Well, it's tough to have clear memories of such an emotional event.

501
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,159
Lannis Pauling was an unusual public figure and that many people who didn't even know him felt

502
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:22,480
very strongly about him either positively or in some cases negatively perhaps and people who knew him

503
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,800
really tended to love him because he was such a charming, magnanimous and wonderful person to be

504
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,360
around and when he died I think everybody that knew him was grief-stricken myself included and it

505
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:41,840
was very difficult. I was asked to speak at that funeral as was the president of Stanford University

506
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,080
Gerhard Kasper and a number of other people and it was very difficult to maintain composure and talk

507
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,080
about why Lannis Pauling at that event. What was the follow-up of his death experience?

508
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:04,719
Well, the immediate follow-up was probably a rise in memorial contributions in honor of Lannis Pauling.

509
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,400
We were of course very concerned about the long-term success of the Lannis Pauling Institute

510
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,000
because many people who had contributed money believed rightly so in many cases that Lannis

511
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,079
Pauling was at the helm of the ship and he was directing the research and he was director of

512
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,920
research at the end of his life and we were concerned that absent Lannis Pauling people might

513
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,000
start to lose interest in the Lannis Pauling Institute and stop supporting it financially and we

514
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,199
had no endowment at the time and we had some zoning problems with the building in Palo Alto. We were

515
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:46,239
in a least building on a commercially-zoned site in 440 Page Mail Road which was scheduled to change

516
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:54,000
residential zoning. So we knew we had to move and absent Lannis Pauling, no endowment and moving

517
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,119
was quite a challenge for the Institute and I alluded to this earlier the Board of Trustees

518
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,039
Lannis Pauling Jr. and myself really grappled for a long time with these issues thinking about

519
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:14,399
different opportunities and options for relocation and ultimately decided to come to an academic

520
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:22,000
institution because academic institutions except for a few tend to be permanent and we started

521
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,200
to look at academic institutions that were doing work that was compatible with Lannis Pauling

522
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,519
Institute of Science and Medicine's mission where this work in orthomolecular medicine would

523
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:39,599
find a good home and be able to be carried out as a working tribute to Lannis Pauling's ideas in

524
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:49,440
orthomolecular medicine. Very lucky for us during those deliberations we were the happy

525
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,279
recipients of a number of large bequest and those bequest allowed us to establish at least a small

526
00:52:55,279 --> 00:53:00,159
endowment I shouldn't say endowment but to have enough money to fund an endowment for the

527
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:05,199
director's chair here at the Lannis Pauling Institute at Oregon State University which at that time

528
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:12,879
was matched by the state so it was a functional $3 million endowment which allowed us to attract

529
00:53:12,879 --> 00:53:18,159
very high caliber director and subsequently with the help of the Research Office at Oregon State

530
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,159
University we were able to attract high caliber faculty as well so.

531
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:29,839
Well that's the end of my set of questions on the point I guess I'll just ask you if there's anything

532
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,440
else about polyproportality or personal characteristics or the relationship that you share that you're

533
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,680
interested in anything that is needed. Well I think I've said before I found him to be very funny

534
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,640
he was he was very charming very witty of course seemed to know everyone know everything

535
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,840
he was just a joy to be around and maybe I mentioned in our last interview that when Zellacermin

536
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,880
and I had finally succeeded in producing some material in a superconductivity project that

537
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:08,559
we all thought would exhibit a higher superconductive temperature to see the expression of

538
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,760
delight on Pauling's face when we showed him the material that we produced was

539
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,559
extremely memorable I have vivid memories of that because he was just as gleeful as a teenager

540
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:28,239
on a first date to show him that material and he just had a real joy for scientific discovery

541
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:37,840
and I think that was the the thing that most motivated him in life.
