1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,279
So as in the past, you've introduced yourself and get a big date.

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,279
My name is Steve Lawson.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:17,519
It's the 8th of November, 2011, we're in a room in the Valley Library.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,559
So in our past interviews, we talked mainly about your relationship with one of my point

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,000
when I want to start to email a beginning with this interview and over the next seven

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
years together, we'll be talking about the next day of the Linus Point.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,079
And so I'm wondering if you could recall anything about your initial interview of the L.D.I.S.

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
and back in 1978.

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,079
Right.

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:50,600
After I graduated from college, I spent a fairly parapetatic number of years traveling around

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,320
the country, visiting relatives and friends around the country, and finally came back to

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,960
Palo Alto, California because I really truly loved the Bay Area.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,480
At that time, it was very exciting, terrific environment.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,200
I loved everything about California and in particular, the Bay Area, culturally or artistically,

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,280
intellectually, a very stimulating environment.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,560
So I wanted to try to remain in the Bay Area possible, although I still at that point

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,519
was not very career oriented.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,319
Didn't really have a very clear idea of what I wanted to do in the future.

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:30,759
At some point, and I'm not exactly sure how, I became aware of a listing for a position

22
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,079
at the Linus Pung Institute of Science and Medicine, which at that time was located at 2700

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,079
Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just opposite Stanford Linear Accelerator, in an office building,

24
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,840
up the street from Addison Wellesley and a number of other publishing houses that were

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,799
located along that road at the time.

26
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,280
Property that was owned by Tom Ford, who I believe was perhaps on the Board of Trustees of Stanford

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,200
University, or a large donor in Stanford University at the time.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,159
So it was in 1977 that I interviewed for a position at the institute, and the initial

29
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,439
position was part time.

30
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,079
And then in February of 1978, it turned into a full-time, salary position.

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:25,000
And initially I interviewed with Karin Gorham, I believe, who was the Secretary of the

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,919
Institute and head of HR department for whatever that was worth at the time, a fairly small

33
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,919
organization still.

34
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,919
And I guess she was sufficiently impressed to ask me to come back to meet with Art Robinson,

35
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,039
who was the President and Director of the Institute.

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:53,039
And Art had recently, in 1976, 1977, set up a program of direct male solicitation in

37
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,919
order to bolster the financial base of the institute, because grants were very hard to

38
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,439
come by.

39
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,000
And in particular, the work on vitamin C that Linus Pauling felt so strongly about was very

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
hard to fund.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,439
So they turned to the public for funding source.

42
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:19,159
And that resulted in buying and trading mailing lists primarily to magazines that whose subscribers

43
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,039
might be interested in the mission and the work of the Linus Pauling Institute.

44
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,520
Magazines in particular like prevention, which in those days had a much less pharmaceutical

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,280
orientation than it has today.

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,280
It was kind of a companion publication to Rodale's organic farming and gardening magazine.

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,199
So I think Rodale Press had kind of an orthomolecular perspective on not just farming and gardening,

48
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,800
but also on health.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,159
In those days, they emphasized nutrition and vitamin supplements and things like that.

50
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,800
So that seemed like a very likely candidate for raising money to support research efforts

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,560
at the Institute.

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,719
And that program was very successful.

53
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,680
So it resulted in a tremendous amount of male in the processing of donations.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,879
So the job, the specific job that I interviewed for at that time, had to do with, there was

55
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,500
related to this direct male program, processing of donations, and also initially some fairly

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,840
rudimentary statistical analyses of the donations where they were coming from the magnitude of

57
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,719
donations, what mailing lists were succeeding, which were failing, and so forth.

58
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,719
So that was what I was doing initially.

59
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:41,479
What was your impression of the Institute when you first arrived at the Institute there?

60
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,439
Well I thought the Atmosphere at the Institute was quite collegial.

61
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,000
The Institute shared that building on Sandhill Road with Kemper Insurance.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,319
So the Institute did not have access to all the rooms in the building, and it was clear

63
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,639
that what had been built and designed as an office building had been renovated to some

64
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,600
extent to accommodate the Institute's research.

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,399
So it wasn't really laid out optimally as a research facility, but nevertheless I think

66
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,560
they did a terrific job of shoe-horning the various research programs into the available

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
space.

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,879
How much space do you have in there?

69
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,560
Well I'd have to consult notes.

70
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,680
I can't remember how many square feet.

71
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,439
I know that the next facility on Page Mill Road, 440 Page Mill Road, was over 20,000 square

72
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,920
feet, so this facility was less than 20,000 square feet available to the Institute.

73
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,339
And there were programs in metabolite profiling or metabolic profiling underway as well as vitamin

74
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:47,659
scene cancer and some other sundry studies that did not require large laboratory facility.

75
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,620
There was quite a lot of chemical work on vitamin C done by Connie Chow at the time under

76
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,979
Pauling's direction, which didn't really require a lot of floor space in a laboratory.

77
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:04,139
And then there were also animal experiments underway which did require quite a lot of square

78
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,859
footage to carry out.

79
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,540
And then of course there was the volcano source field ionization mass spectrometer, which

80
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,420
was a lab unto itself.

81
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:21,180
And that was being developed by Bill Abert, who was a physicist, formerly an SRI, which

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,780
was near the US Geographical Survey, Geological Survey, Facility and Mental Park.

83
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,740
And also I think originally had some relationship with Stanford University, but then had become

84
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
independent.

85
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,340
And I actually learned to do cell culture work when I set up the first cell culture

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,819
facility at the Institute a while later.

87
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,139
I think that the, everybody seemed to be very friendly and very dedicated to the work they

88
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,139
were doing.

89
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,620
I was particularly struck by the dedication of Art Robinson and Rick Hicks, who was the

90
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,860
executive vice president and charge of fundraising.

91
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,819
And you and Cameron, who would come by from time to time, he was a non-resident fellow,

92
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,860
I believe at the time.

93
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,339
And later became medical director of the Institute and moved to California.

94
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:12,379
But in those days in San Hill Road, he was still, I believe, non-resident fellow, carrying

95
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,339
at the clinical collaboration with minus Pauline and Scotland.

96
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,300
And I would say that everyone was extremely enthusiastic and dedicated.

97
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,019
It seemed to be a pretty cohesive group.

98
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,139
And that part of the ambience there really appealed to me.

99
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,500
So as far as a working environment, it seemed to be quite good.

100
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,060
It wasn't until a little later that there was a schism that developed between Art Robinson

101
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:47,539
and Linus Pauline, where things tended to become awkward and sourd a little at that time.

102
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,500
What was Robinson's legacy delighted at that point?

103
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,579
I would say he was, yes, he actually hired me.

104
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,579
I interviewed with him.

105
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,300
I found him to be a very intense, motivated person.

106
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,460
And I liked him.

107
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,259
I thought his personality, as I said, was quite intense.

108
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:08,420
But he seemed to be very bright, very sharp, very insightful.

109
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,580
And I enjoyed working with him and for him in the direct mail program.

110
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,580
Excuse me.

111
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:23,500
As this schism developed between Robinson and Pauline, and Robinson was no longer physically

112
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,860
present in the Institute.

113
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,860
I had been working, actually I think almost from the inception of my employment at the

114
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,980
Institute, as time permitted in scientific operations, Alan Sheetz was a biochemist who

115
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,379
was doing work on vitamin C and also in the vitamin C in skin cancer experiments that

116
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:49,139
were being overseen by Robinson and Pauline at that time.

117
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,259
And Alan and I really headed off together and liked to talk about science.

118
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,340
And of course I had some background in science at Stanford.

119
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,939
So they were sometimes short staffed in the scientific sector and I would volunteer to

120
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:10,899
do work with the animals in the laboratory.

121
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,740
And I think I had an aptitude for that work and some competence as well.

122
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,340
And that was recognized by Alan and Dick Willoughby and other people who were involved in

123
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,379
that realm at the time.

124
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:29,820
So gradually my responsibilities and my activities shifted from the direct mail campaign to working

125
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,740
as a research assistant, a research associate in the laboratory environment.

126
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,740
A meal, Zudra Kable, that I have in February 1977 at the Institute.

127
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,019
What was the goal at that time?

128
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:50,379
A meal had been a non-resident fellow, I believe, of the Institute and then joined the Institute

129
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,500
to work with Pauline and to continue independent work on the Journal of Molecular Evolution,

130
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,419
which he was the founding editor of.

131
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:06,419
And he had some pretty interesting ideas that were mainly theoretical in nature.

132
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,899
And so a meal didn't really need a laboratory to carry out his work at the time.

133
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,539
Of course he and Pauline had known each other for a very long time.

134
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,819
Sookakondol, I believe, had been at Caltech.

135
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:23,379
And the two of them had developed this concept of chemical paleogenetics,

136
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:28,259
or molecular evolution in probably the late 50s or early 60s,

137
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,339
was published in the early 1960s, which Francis Crick thought was one of Pauline's major achievements.

138
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,019
And I think actually most of it was probably due to Zurkakondol's ideas.

139
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:42,219
But nevertheless, together they developed this very interesting idea,

140
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,220
stating the divergence of species based upon similarities in hemoglobin,

141
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,220
which are shared, molecule which shared among very many million species, vertebrate species.

142
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,220
A meal was a very interesting, very kindly person.

143
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:08,220
He was definitely European in nature, and seemed to be extremely intelligent.

144
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,220
A meal was one of the rare individuals who could hold many competitive ideas

145
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,220
in his mind simultaneously and expound upon each of them in turn.

146
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,220
So I found him very challenging intellect, and I really enjoyed talking with him.

147
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:33,220
And sometime later I started working, I was working for different groups within the institute,

148
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,220
which were quite small, and a meal, and I got along so well,

149
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,220
that a meal wanted me to do more and more work with him.

150
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,220
This was after he became President and Director of the Institute,

151
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,220
after the departure of Art Robinson.

152
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:53,220
And that led to kind of a long collaboration with a meal that culminated in my appointment

153
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,220
as co-director of the Laboratory for Research and Gene Regulation in the mid 1980s.

154
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,220
A meal at that time was very interested in cancer metastasis,

155
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,220
and what genes, what proteins were involved in the development of that phenotype,

156
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,220
because many people who suffer and die from cancer will die from metastatic involvement,

157
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:23,220
even if the primary tumor is surgically treated successfully with radiation in chemotherapy,

158
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,220
it's often not possible to kill all the metastatic cells that can move through the lymph system,

159
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,220
or through the blood system, and colonize other tissues.

160
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,220
So a meal was very interested in that, and we set up a program at the institute

161
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,220
to use a technique called two-dimensional polyacrylate my gel electrophoresis.

162
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,220
Excuse me, to profile proteins present in tumor cells and metastatic tumor cells

163
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,220
related to the primary tumor and also normal tissue,

164
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,220
to look for proteins that might be involved, and therefore genes that might be involved

165
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
in the development of this phenotype.

166
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,220
And I think a meal had the idea at that time that these might be regulatory proteins,

167
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,220
which would be present in very small amounts in cells.

168
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,220
So we had to set up a cell culture laboratory, which I did,

169
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,220
bought all the equipment, read a lot about tissue culture,

170
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,220
and what was important, and what kind of equipment would be appropriate.

171
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,220
Learn the techniques at SRI, and also learn some techniques at UCSD,

172
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:31,220
and University of Colorado in Boulder, about to find media,

173
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,220
because we were very interested in eliminating, or perhaps eliminating,

174
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,220
it's not the right word, reducing to the greatest extent possible,

175
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
the amount of noise in the system.

176
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,220
And we wanted to increase reproducibility of our protein profile as well,

177
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,220
because if regulatory proteins are involved in this process of metastatic cancer,

178
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,220
then we need to be able to detect them.

179
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,220
And to detect them, we need to increase reproducibility and decrease noise in the system.

180
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,220
So I spend quite a lot of time with my colleagues, Stuart McGuire,

181
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,220
and Eddie Metz, and Mark Pack and others in trying to perfect that system.

182
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,220
So does this panel maintain a pretty active research program,

183
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
even though he was assuming more and more administrative work as well?

184
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,220
He did. That's right. He did assume more and more administrative load.

185
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Pauling, of course, I think, had plenty of aptitude for administration,

186
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,220
but was less interested in administration.

187
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Pauling really wanted to concentrate on his theoretical work, his clinical work,

188
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,220
the vitamin C work, or the molecular medical work, and Sukukondle

189
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,220
from a research perspective was probably a little broader in what he wanted the institute to become.

190
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,220
And as his influence in administration increased, and the funding available to the institute increased,

191
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,220
the focus in the institute also brought to be much more kind of a molecular biological approach

192
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,220
to health and disease rather than specifically focused on orthomolecular medicine.

193
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,220
So, for instance, the program that I was involved in looking at gene regulation and cancer

194
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,220
really had nothing to do specifically with orthomolecular medicine or nutrition.

195
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,220
So I think Emil had a vision for the institute as something like the Saul Institute in La Jolla

196
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,220
or the institute that he had founded in France and left before he joined the Linus-Paul Institute of Science in Medicine,

197
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,220
which was much more of a molecular biological approach to science.

198
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,220
He mentioned his intelligence, how will he characterize his personality?

199
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:50,220
Well, I think that he was very kinetic.

200
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:58,220
He was very tall, lean person, had a lot of physical energy as well as mental stamina and vigor,

201
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,220
and also had a very European attitude about things.

202
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:10,220
I think in some ways this served him well and in some ways it may not have served him terribly well

203
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,220
because the administration in the institute became a little bit of a black box,

204
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,220
and perhaps was not quite as transparent as it could have been that would have promoted better relations

205
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,220
among employees much later in the history of the institute.

206
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,220
And this is an extension of the year-to-end of the past season?

207
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,220
I mean, it's hard to say I'm not a psychologist and I don't know that much about European political systems,

208
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:47,220
but I think Emil was kind of a benevolent king.

209
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Well, at an or personal or a social level, do you have memorable interactions with Super-Manual?

210
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Well, I had many, many interactions with Emil over the years.

211
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:05,220
He had a terrific sense of humor and not so much in a joke-telling way, but a good sense of irony,

212
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,220
and we got along very, very well.

213
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:15,220
And I think Emil depended upon me and Eddie Metz, who was another research associate at the institute,

214
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:22,220
and a number of other people within his group to help him make decisions about hiring, for instance.

215
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,220
So there were a number of people who came to the institute and went through a review process,

216
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,220
candidates for certain positions, and Eddie met some myself and some others.

217
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I think played pretty critical roles in those processes at the time, because Emil rightly or wrongly,

218
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,220
I think, trusted my judgment about people.

219
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:57,220
And I would give him very candid observations to the best extent I could about potential candidates for positions within the institute.

220
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,220
We also shared an appreciation of art.

221
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:07,220
So Emil and his wife, Jane, lived in a penthouse apartment on Rastardero in Palo Alto.

222
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:18,220
And I was relatively frequent guest, and we would talk about art, talk about Emil's heritage, his ancestors, his grandparents, his parents.

223
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,220
We're all very famous in the respective fields, both in psychology, psychoanalysis, anatomy, art.

224
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:36,220
And I remember one time Emil showed me, he was a bit embarrassed about it, because it's not something that has a lot of objective value.

225
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:46,220
But he knew I would be interested in his autograph book, which he had maintained as a kid in his grandmother's salon,

226
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:53,220
and had signatures in this book from Sigmund Floyd and a number of other very famous people, musicians and scientists.

227
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,220
I can't recall exactly who now, but it was pretty impressive to see at the time.

228
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Was he a clunker of art?

229
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:13,220
I don't think he had the financial wherewithal to collect art, but he had had art that he inherited from the family.

230
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:21,220
And Emil's family was Jewish and had lived in both Austria, Vienna and France.

231
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:33,220
And during the Nazi occupation and Nazi infiltration of countries in Europe, his family was forced to flee and often fled without their possession.

232
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:44,220
So I know many years later he showed me a catalog of German art and architecture in which his parents' chairs were featured.

233
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:53,220
And these were chairs that were part of the old Zupacondle home that they'd been forced to abandon when the Nazis arrived.

234
00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:01,220
And he had remnants of some art that he'd been able to take with him, Gustav Klimt, a triptitch and things like that,

235
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:11,220
which I think he'd given away actually at that time. But he did have some art and some books that managed to survive that ugly process in Europe.

236
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Okay, well I want to talk now about art Robinson. And then basically, first of all, annoyingly as a scientist wasn't you initially met in the interaction with him?

237
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Yeah, that's a good question. I would say that I did not have enough science acumen at that time to offer any judgment on art Robinson.

238
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I knew that he was working very closely with Linus Polling, so I assume that he must be brilliant because I doubted that Linus Polling would tolerate fools.

239
00:20:41,220 --> 00:21:01,220
And research was clearly the most important thing in Pauling's life, research and science. And I just imagined that art Robinson must be a terrifically intelligent person to be working with Linus Polling because otherwise he wouldn't be at the institute.

240
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:15,220
He seemed to have Polling's trust and many people had pretty high regard for art Robinson, called him kind of the boy wonder. He was quite young at that time as well. Maybe in his 30s I believe when he was president and director of the institute.

241
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:42,220
He came up from UCSD to take a position in Polling's lab at Stanford and then together with Kendim at Co-Found at the institute, while the institute was still located at Stanford and then when they were able to secure a rental site in this building on Sandhill Road then they moved physically the institute and transferred the grants to the Sandhill Road location.

242
00:21:42,220 --> 00:22:02,220
I had a very favorable impression of art. I liked him quite a lot and he seemed to be incredibly driven. I didn't know at that time anything about his politics, his religion or anything. I never asked him about those things, I never talked to him about those things. It was all strictly science.

243
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:18,220
I really enjoyed my interactions with him at that time. I was not high enough up in the food chain, the bureaucracy within the institute to really understand at the time the nature of the conflict that developed between art Robinson and Linus Polling.

244
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:42,220
I was completely in the dark as to why that developed and why art left the institute. There was a series of very bewildering memos at that time. I remember after art left and of course there was gossip about what was going on and who was in charge and what had happened and so forth.

245
00:22:42,220 --> 00:23:06,220
I can't really remember the gossip very clearly but I do remember coming into my office one day and finding a memo from Linus Polling, a couple of short paragraphs explaining that art Robinson and absented himself from the institute and was no longer serving as the president director of Linus Polling was taking over that position and I should ignore directives from art Robinson.

246
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:21,220
That was followed the next day by a memo from art Robinson to the effect that Linus Polling had no authority to remove him from his position and I should disregard the earlier memo from Linus Polling and things like that went back and forth for a while.

247
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:50,220
So it was a period of tension to say the least at the institute people were a little bewildered as to what to do but I think ultimately because Linus Polling was chairman of the board and the institute was named for him and I think people just inferred that Linus Polling was in charge and therefore Linus Polling was the one who had the authority of say on what the status of art Robinson was at that time.

248
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,220
So what do you think about Robinson as a personality in Tenskies and Fee or the Dump of the Line?

249
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Yes, he was very intense, very driven, no question about that.

250
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Any other adjectives that would suit you?

251
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Well, he had a very robust family life. I mean he was very, his wife Laura Lee Robinson at the time was working at the institute in the data acquisition and analysis from the metabolic profiling program.

252
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,220
So she was there quite often, she was a very lovely person I liked her very much as well.

253
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,220
And together they seemed like a very good pair, very happy married couple.

254
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:42,220
It was quite a shock when she died so suddenly and Art of course had small children that he had to turn his attention to and to raise and it just seemed like a very stressful time for everyone.

255
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:57,220
The combination of Laura Lee's very abrupt death, Art having his young kids to take care of now and also having this problem of Linus Polling and essentially losing his job at the institute.

256
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:11,220
I do remember that prior to the schism with Linus Polling there had been several meetings in the institute's library about the future of the institute.

257
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:20,220
And the prospect of moving to Oregon had been raised by Art Robinson specifically at that time.

258
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:39,220
The late 1970s, Art had talked about property in Oregon and if my memory serves me I think it was near Eugene or Junction City that might be available at low cost for the institute to buy and build a building and set up laboratories there.

259
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:53,220
And I think that there was an informal poll taken among staff as to who might be interested in relocating to Oregon at that time. Not many people were.

260
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,220
Do you know anything more about where this idea came from on Oregon?

261
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,220
I don't.

262
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Well, I should say also that when the schism between Polling and Art developed, it occurred to me that that might have been one of the factors that led to this problem because Polling of course had a very close relationship with friends and faculty at Stanford still, hard McConnell, Henry Taub, a number of other people in the chemistry department there and elsewhere.

263
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:38,220
He had homes in Portola Valley and Big Sur and it didn't seem to me that he would want at his age and station and life to move to Oregon.

264
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:46,220
And I was never at that time I wondered whether that was part of the problem that had developed between them.

265
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,220
So in hindsight, do you have any other thoughts on what life was given?

266
00:26:52,220 --> 00:27:10,220
Well, when I became Chief Executive Officer or Executive Officer in the Linus Plains Institute in the early 1990s, I was talking about the institute before lots of groups quite often.

267
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:18,220
And consequently, I had to familiarize myself pretty quickly with the history of the institute and some of the major figures in the institute.

268
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,220
So I really had to learn a lot more about Linus Polling, his career than I previously had known.

269
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:33,220
And I had to learn about Art Robinson and some of the activities that had transpired at the institute over the years.

270
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:51,220
So I looked at some of the depositions, I looked at the court papers that were now available to me as Executive Officer and I read that material quite carefully at the time because I wanted to be able to represent the story accurately and to the best of my ability.

271
00:27:51,220 --> 00:28:00,220
So I thought it was incumbent upon me to learn as much as I could about that problem that developed between Robinson and Polling so that I would have a good understanding of it.

272
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:12,220
And I wouldn't be simply mousing some person's opinion of what had happened but I had actually formed an opinion myself based on original research into the raw data, if you will.

273
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:19,220
And that led me to the conclusion that there were administrative problems that had developed between Robinson and Polling.

274
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:31,220
It didn't have anything to do with the results from the vitamin C and skin cancer experiments as far as I could tell as Art Robinson portrayed the whole problem.

275
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Art said that the anomalous results at low dose supplemental vitamin C that actually resulted in increased number of tumors in these hairless mice exposed to ultraviolet light.

276
00:28:46,220 --> 00:29:06,220
If you extrapolated that to people, it would be at risk for developing cancer, let's say skin cancer in this case, at the doses of supplementary vitamin C that Polling was recommending for good health.

277
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:28,220
But there was a significant problem in that argument and the problem is that mice synthesize vitamin C. And I believe even Art himself at the time had suggested that the exogenous vitamin C given in the diet to these mice might have affected their endogenous synthesis of vitamin C, especially at low dose.

278
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:50,220
And Connie Chow and a number of other people, Ping Loan at the institute looked into that four-linus Polling very carefully and found that, sure enough, when you give small extra doses of vitamin C to mice, you actually decrease the amount of vitamin C in blood and various organs and tissues compared to the mice getting no extra vitamin C.

279
00:29:50,220 --> 00:30:07,220
And you actually have to overcome that by giving much larger amounts of vitamin C. And then you start to see increases in vitamin C in these various tissues and organs and the blood and also protection against the development of skin cancer caused by exposure to ultraviolet light.

280
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:18,220
So it has nothing to do with people because we don't synthesize vitamin C. So supplemental vitamin C doesn't interfere with anything that we're doing in our livers unlike the mice.

281
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:28,220
So that argument that Art put forward to explain this problem with Linus Polling didn't seem to hold water to me.

282
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:44,220
And I looked more carefully at some of the administrative decisions that were being made at that time, specifically with respect to Richard Hicks and affiliation with a group in Santa Cruz, the Hunsburgers, that Polling was not very happy about.

283
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:55,220
And Hunsburgers were very interested in wheat grass and ebbsisic acid as having cancer prevention or therapeutic properties.

284
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:05,220
And some experiments along those lines were carried out at the institute where wheat grass was being fed to mice to find out if it could protect them against cancer.

285
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:19,220
But Polling, I think, and I never talked to him about this, but inferring from what I read, it seemed to me that he was concerned about somewhat flaky character of this operation in Santa Cruz.

286
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:29,220
And he was worried about a close affiliation because the work that he was already advocating and trying to get funded seemed to be very controversial anyway.

287
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:42,220
And I don't think he wanted to encourage even more skepticism about the institute's activities by getting associated with fringe or what he might consider fringe organizations.

288
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
Robinson had a different perspective.

289
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:56,220
And also, I think Polling had set up an executive committee composed of himself, Rick Hicks and Art.

290
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:07,220
And I believe that Art was asked not to make any important decisions without approval of the executive committee.

291
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:17,220
And Art essentially ignored that and wanted to fire Rick Hicks and Polling like Hicks and thought he was doing a good job.

292
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:30,220
So I think that the conflict that developed between them had to do with administrative issues, how to run and govern the Linus Plains to Science and Medicine, not scientific issues.

293
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,220
So what did you have a sense of what the conflict was between Robinson and Hicks?

294
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:47,220
I don't really. I think that Robinson was unhappy with Hicks' performance. And maybe Hicks had not done some things that Robinson expected him to do or had asked him to do.

295
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:55,220
They also had very different personalities. And there could have been a bit of a personality clash there as well.

296
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:03,220
So how did the legal brain like to play out Robinson suitings? And that was a multi-year affair?

297
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,220
It was a multi-year affair. It was very distracting to all involve, very expensive proposition.

298
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:15,220
There were lots of suits. Of course, at that time, I didn't really involve myself with any of that because I had no administrative function.

299
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:26,220
So I was just happy doing my research and not worrying about what was going on in the legal realm or the administrative hierarchy of the Institute.

300
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:40,220
But in looking back at these documents retrospectively, it's clear that people were completely subsumed with these legal issues because when these kinds of charges are made and these suits are filed, you really have to do the best you can to protect the organization.

301
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:50,220
And that means hiring good attorneys and getting into the details of all the issues and countless depositions and document analyses.

302
00:33:50,220 --> 00:34:02,220
And it's all very tedious and very expensive. In a way, it's also quite fascinating because jurisprudence is a very interesting game, legal game that gets played.

303
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:14,220
And it's interesting to see how the strategies evolve and how the players behave. But it can be incredibly distracting if your main goal is to carry out research.

304
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:25,220
And I think it was very distracting for everybody involved and art ended up suing his attorneys because he was unhappy with the settlement that had eventually been reached.

305
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:39,219
And sometime much later, I think between the time I became chief executive officer at Linus Pong's death, art Robinson re-emerged from the past.

306
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:51,219
And really, I had had nothing to do with him and hadn't heard from him or about him for many, many years because after the settlement in the early 1980s, that was the end of the legal entanglement with art Robinson.

307
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:59,219
And I knew that he had moved to Oregon to cave junction and set up his own research organization. I wasn't quite sure exactly what he was doing.

308
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:08,219
This was long before the internet, of course, and it was difficult to fair it out details about people's activities unlike today.

309
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:15,219
So I really had no reason to think about art Robinson until I got a phone call or a letter.

310
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:30,219
Actually, it was a letter, I believe, addressed to Linus Pauling from art that Pauling turned over to me that was a request for access to research data that art had generated at the institute before his departure.

311
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:56,219
So art described this research data as being many filing the five, the steel case five drawer filing cabinets, maybe 10 or 15 of those worth of hard copy paper records that were generated as a result of the metabolic profiling program.

312
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:03,219
And also very large magnetic data tapes that were maybe a foot in diameter.

313
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:13,219
And at the time, without going back and actually looking at the terms of the settlement, which of course stipulated that none of that had to be given to art Robinson,

314
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:23,219
and he'd already been given an opportunity to copy his research data, albeit at high cost before he left the institute, he declined to do so at that time.

315
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:30,219
But I thought all these years had gone by, there was really nothing to be gained in withholding anything from art Robinson.

316
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:45,219
And if he was able to translate this raw data into scientific publications that would be scientifically or medically valuable, I was in favor of that.

317
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:53,219
So I decided to look around and see what I could find that was that resembled what he'd asked for.

318
00:36:53,219 --> 00:37:00,219
And in looking around the institute, I could find nothing that resembled the volume of material that he had requested.

319
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:05,219
There weren't boxes and boxes or many filing cabinets full of data.

320
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:11,219
There weren't dozens or hundreds of magnetic data tapes. These things just didn't exist within the building.

321
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:19,219
So I queried a number of people, including Dick Willoughby, who was our facilities manager, Emil Zucacondle, who had left the institute at that time.

322
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:25,219
And a number of other people who I thought might have had some knowledge of the whereabouts of this material over time.

323
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:29,219
No one really seemed to have a clear idea of what had happened to it.

324
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:35,219
But I reconstructed what I believe to be its disposition.

325
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:41,219
And I sent this in a letter, Dart Robinson. What I considered a very collegial, cordial letter.

326
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:45,219
I mean, it was unhappy news for our Robinson, but nevertheless it was as far as I knew.

327
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:50,219
And as far as I still know, the truth about the disposition of this material.

328
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:56,219
The institute had a satellite facility on Porter Drive in Stanford, Indutual Park.

329
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:04,219
And that satellite facility was used for Susa Cala, aging research that was carried out by Jim Fleming and others.

330
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:19,219
Also, in the 1980s, we had carried out some work on fabricating superconductive material to support one of Pauling's patent application, Stella Kerman, and to some extent, you and Cameron and I worked on that project.

331
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:24,219
And we also used a number of rooms there for paper storage.

332
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:33,219
And we'd had problems with the roof leaking in that facility that actually led to a lawsuit with a landlord.

333
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:40,219
And a lot of the paper that had been stored in that facility was ruined because the leak, the roof leaked.

334
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:43,219
And the paper was damaged by water.

335
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:51,219
And I believe that it was just thrown out. And because it was damaged, there wasn't any attempt made to really examine it carefully.

336
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,219
I'm reconstructing that. I don't know that for sure.

337
00:38:54,219 --> 00:39:01,219
But I do know, because I did see it with my own eyes. A lot of destroyed records by water.

338
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:09,219
And I gave that as what I considered a reasonable explanation of what had happened to our research material.

339
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:17,219
My understanding was that it had been stored up there because there wasn't any room to really keep it in the 440-page mill road facility.

340
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:25,219
If, indeed, it had been kept that long, it was at Porter Drive and probably destroyed by water from a leaking roof.

341
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:33,219
That, as I said, led to litigation with the landlord because the landlord wasn't quick in repairing the roof, unfortunately.

342
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:45,219
So Art did not take that news very well. And in a way, I can sympathize with it because that work represented a significant percent of his wife's work at that time.

343
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:54,219
But that's the way it is. The material was gone. It was probably destroyed, probably damaged. And there was nothing to give him.

344
00:39:54,219 --> 00:40:06,219
But he was unwilling to accept that explanation and believed for whatever reason very obscure to me that I must be hiding this material or lying to him, mischaracterizing everything.

345
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:15,219
And I tried to think about what his motivation for believing that I would do that. And I just could not come up with a sensible motivation.

346
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:27,219
I think that he played so much emphasis on the importance of this material that it was beyond comprehension to him that it could have been thrown away, even having been damaged.

347
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:43,219
So he was unwilling to accept that explanation. And that led to kind of a proxy lawsuit against the Institute by a colleague of his, Jane Orient, who I think is associated with him in kind of libertarian politics.

348
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:54,219
And she's a physician in Arizona, at least at the time, who had made rather strategically, I believe, a small donation to the Institute.

349
00:40:54,219 --> 00:41:03,219
And then later wanted access to research records. And she called me on the telephone and I had a nice conversation with her and she was asking about research.

350
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:14,219
And at first I was confused. I thought she was talking about the protein profiling work. And then I realized that she was talking about the metabolic profiling work.

351
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:27,219
And I talked about some of the work that had been ongoing until the mid 1980s and so forth. And the development of the apparatus and data collection and analysis and loss of funding and so forth.

352
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:39,219
And I came clear that what she was really interested in was this old art robins in the material. And I think at the time I told her the same thing I told art, which is I don't know what happened to it. We don't have it.

353
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:49,219
So I can't offer it to you. So that led to a suit that she filed against the Institute for access to this publicly financed research data.

354
00:41:49,219 --> 00:42:00,219
That of course involved a lot of time and energy and resources, but eventually was dismissed by the court for lack of standing essentially.

355
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:07,219
Do you have a sense of was it a brain sort of reconciliation involved in the following diet?

356
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:24,219
Well, I think arts letter to Linus Pauling and Linus Pauling's response to him if there was a response was cordial. Arts letter was pretty cordial. So I don't know that they communicated much from the time the lawsuit finished until that letter in the early 1990s.

357
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:37,219
My guess is they probably did not because art really in many at many occasions have lots of bad things to say about the Institute and Linus Pauling. So I can't imagine that they really communicated much.

358
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:53,219
And I don't know that that was arts attempt reconciliation or whether he viewed that opportunity of me being in charge in the Institute now and Pauling gradually expiring as an opportunity to

359
00:42:53,219 --> 00:43:00,219
get access to research data that he thought we've been sitting on all those years.

360
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:14,219
Okay, well we switched to you in Cameron. He arrived in 1978 perhaps in a full time capacity of mental risk. But did you recall your first impressions of Cameron?

361
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:28,219
Cameron was a wonderful person. He was very charming. He had a great sense of humor. He also had the Scottish brogue and was shy I think.

362
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:39,219
He didn't like to talk in public and sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying because of his accent and a tendency a bit to mumble sometimes.

363
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:53,219
But he was very intelligent, very compassionate. Clearly a research-minded physician who was interested in finding new ways to help his patients live with cancer.

364
00:43:53,219 --> 00:44:05,219
I think he and Pauling initially thought that vitamin C might be able to turn cancer into a manageable disease, a chronic disease rather than something that would kill you in short order.

365
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:13,219
And that led him to consider vitamin C as having potential value and treating cancer patients. I really enjoyed him.

366
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:26,219
I would go to parties with him quite often. He loved to drink single malt scotch which he would bring from every time he went to Scotland and came back he would always have him.

367
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:33,219
It seemed like an arm-load of single malt scotches for everyone to try. And he liked to smoke cigarettes too.

368
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:45,219
Which was a bit ironic. Sometimes it's the old do as I say, but not as I do motif that you see sometimes with physicians or other people.

369
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:54,219
Cameron was not pious. He didn't preach to people about what they should or shouldn't do. And he was well aware of his own bad habit of smoking.

370
00:44:54,219 --> 00:45:07,219
He was hard to reconcile with his career as a cancer surgeon, removing disease lungs and other tissue from patients. But nevertheless he found it very difficult to quit.

371
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:12,219
I know he tried to quit smoking a number of times but didn't succeed.

372
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:24,219
So I kind of liked him because he had some weaknesses as well. But he was extremely bright and very compassionate person.

373
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:28,219
And in party settings he was more socialized.

374
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,219
And in his party settings he was more social.

375
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:37,219
Yeah he was very social. Very very social. My girlfriend and I loved to hear him tell tales about his work in Burma.

376
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:48,219
I remember one story he told about lancing a boil on an elephant which was quite extraordinary.

377
00:45:48,219 --> 00:46:01,219
And he told me about some of the therapy available to the cohort of cancer patients that he was treating which was called Brompton's cocktail which was a mixture of I believe alcohol, cocaine and heroin.

378
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:10,219
That's got its surgeons and physicians very freely gave to their terminal cancer patients because they weren't concerned about these people becoming drug addicts.

379
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:18,219
They just wanted to make their end of their lives as comfortable and pain free as possible.

380
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:28,219
Did Pauline ever come into the hospital in Cameron to you as his personal feelings towards similar professional feelings?

381
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:33,219
Pauline really liked you in Cameron. I think he had a very deep feeling for you in Cameron.

382
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:38,219
And despite the fact that Cameron smoked Pauline was apparently willing to completely overlook that.

383
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:50,219
And Pauline felt very strongly about smoking. I remember seeing letters that were unopened in Dorothy Monroe's office because they smelled of cigarette smoke and Pauline refused to handle them.

384
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:55,219
So that didn't seem to bother him so much about you in Cameron though.

385
00:46:55,219 --> 00:47:00,219
And they were great colleagues. I think they enjoyed each other's company quite a lot.

386
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:08,219
And Cameron regaled us with stories. My girlfriend and I about Pauline's first visit to Scotland.

387
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:13,219
I didn't mention this in the last talk today. The toilets. Did I mention that?

388
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:21,219
Yeah. So Cameron was very down to earth and very much aware of Pauline's reputation and stature in the scientific field too.

389
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:28,219
So Cameron himself was a little bit in awe of Pauline. But Cameron had medical knowledge of course that Pauline didn't.

390
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:36,219
So they provided kind of a nice complimentary relationship for each other I think.

391
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:45,219
And I think as a result of working with Cameron for so long, Pauline became even more medically minded.

392
00:47:45,219 --> 00:48:02,219
And I know that Abram Hofer, another of Pauline's old friends who initially got him interested in Nyson and North Immolecular Psychiatry back in the early 1960s, told me that he had been working hard towards the end of Pauline's life to get him an honorary medical degree.

393
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:07,219
Which apparently is possible in Canada being part of the United Kingdom.

394
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:16,219
You can appeal to the Archbishop of Canterbury. I believe through the Duke of Windsor or something like that to get a medical degree conferred upon someone.

395
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:21,219
Of course it wouldn't allow them to practice medicine but it was a very prestigious honor.

396
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:31,219
And Hofer was working those channels because he knew the English royalty that would help him with this process.

397
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:36,219
But then he dropped it once Pauline died of course.

398
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:39,219
How did Cameron's family do you know that at all?

399
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:42,219
I did. It did not meet Cameron's first wife.

400
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:48,219
I knew Connie Cameron, his second wife quite well because she had been working for Rick Hicks at the Institute.

401
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:53,219
And that's how you and Cameron got to know her through his visits and tenure at the Linus Pauline Institute.

402
00:48:53,219 --> 00:49:00,219
And she also a very charming, very funny, attractive person.

403
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:07,219
You and had a son and a daughter. And he was always a bit concerned about his son.

404
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:17,219
Because his son seemed to be having a bit of a hard time being independent, finding a career, being happy with his life and so forth.

405
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:26,219
You and was also was conflicted a bit in taking the position at the Institute in California because it would take him away from his children.

406
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:31,219
And he was concerned that his children still needed some guidance.

407
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:40,219
But I met his children. They were very nice people, very affable, very intelligent, gregarious people.

408
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:46,219
So how did Cameron's research program evolve over the course of this time at the Institute?

409
00:49:46,219 --> 00:50:01,219
Well, I would say when he was physically at the Institute, he of course was not treating patients in Scotland, but he was continuing to collect and analyze data from those cancer cases in Scotland.

410
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:14,219
And continuing to work with people who were doing that for him in Scotland, developing ways of analyzing the data, automated data collection programs and things of that nature.

411
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:27,219
So he was very involved in that while he was at the Institute. He also became increasingly involved in what today is called outreach or public education.

412
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:40,219
And as the work with Cameron and Pauline on vitamin C in cancer became more well known, there were many queries from the public, particularly patients afflicted with cancer who wanted advice.

413
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:45,219
How much vitamin C should I take? Where can I go to get it and so on and so forth?

414
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:57,219
There had been a clinic operating at the Institute on San Hill Road for a very short period, but it became overburdened by poor patients very quickly.

415
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:05,219
So that was abandoned and that was set up by John Catchpool. And like I said, it didn't last very long.

416
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:25,219
So we were struggling at the time between giving sensible, practical and non-medical advice to people because Cameron wasn't licensed to practice medicine in the United States, so he couldn't give medical advice to people.

417
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:38,219
So we had to be a bit oblique about it and provide patients and their physicians with research papers and allude to responses of other similar patients to a certain course of therapy and so forth.

418
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:52,219
So Cameron was working very hard to kind of perfect our strategy of responding to the public for these health related questions so that we didn't incur legal liability,

419
00:51:52,219 --> 00:52:05,219
but we were acting ethically and morally and trying to be good citizens and compassionate because many of the people who contacted the Institute in those days were in dire straits.

420
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:14,219
These were people for whom traditional conventional therapy was not successful and they were just waiting to die and they weren't willing to accept that fate.

421
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:25,219
So they were turning to other modalities which included things like vitamin C and once they started to consider that naturally the tendency was to get in touch with the Institute and talk to you and Cameron.

422
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:35,219
So he spent an enormous amount of time on the phone and writing letters to cancer patients and other people with questions about vitamin C.

423
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:45,219
Well, Cameron and Pauline's research on cancer attracted a great deal of criticism and do you have a sense of how they respond internally?

424
00:52:45,219 --> 00:53:02,219
Yeah, I think they felt and this has been written about many times and I think you can infer their emotions from some of the letters that appeared in journals and elsewhere that they'd been treated badly by the male clinic.

425
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:13,219
Both Cameron and Pauline were astonished to find out and angry that the male clinic researchers Craig and Mortel had never even read Cameron's papers, relevant papers.

426
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:30,219
So they ostensibly were charged by the NCI with replicating Cameron's work yet they knew virtually nothing about it and had they read Cameron's papers they may have noticed that Cameron was giving high dose vitamin C both orally and intravenously.

427
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:45,219
And that as it turns out may have been a very crucial feature that was completely ignored by them because they perhaps had too much ubrous to read this Scottish surgeon's papers on vitamin C and cancer.

428
00:53:45,219 --> 00:54:14,219
And I think the fact that the studies were published without the courtesy of showing the study before publication to Pauline and Cameron did not sit well with them because once the study was published immediately the media wants responses the same day and it put you in an awkward position because Cameron Pauline had that a time to really read the study and think about it carefully and come up with a cogent analysis and critique of it.

429
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:23,219
So they were angered by that as well because they felt that professional courtesy was not extended to them in that regard.

430
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:40,219
And they felt that the work that the male clinic had done was to use Pauline's word somewhat fraudulent and they were worried that this would end serious consideration of vitamin C as a junk to therapy for cancer.

431
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:53,219
And they felt that that would be unethical and immoral and unscientific and ill conceived so they were upset and it was clear that they were upset.

432
00:54:53,219 --> 00:55:16,219
But Cameron, neither Cameron or Pauline were, they didn't reveal anger, they didn't shout or break things or storm around or anything like that but voices were raised definitely and Cameron was not very pleased by the work that had been done at the male clinic.

433
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:19,219
It showed.

434
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:25,219
How much of the staff, what was the reaction to the criticism of the agencies have?

435
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:45,219
I think everyone was unhappy and angry as well. I think everyone shared the anger that these studies had been published and they weren't carefully done and there seemed to be lots of problems with them that they didn't replicate Cameron's protocol or Cameron's work as they were purportedly did.

436
00:55:45,219 --> 00:56:00,219
I think there was also concern among the fundraising staff that this might bode ill for continuing efforts to raise money to support research at the institute and sure enough, there were some fundraising problems after that that work was published.

437
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:24,219
So it had a big impact on our work at the institute as well as sort of shelving serious consideration of vitamin C and cancer for many, many years which I think was a real disservice to the research community and to the huge population of cancer patients out there who might have benefited from this had the research been done more carefully early on.

438
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:30,219
But the staff continued to believe in the scientific ways of the idea.

439
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:40,219
Yes. And I think partly because the arguments that both Cameron and Pauline loved the leveled against the male clinic researchers were very cogent and sensible.

440
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:45,219
They weren't just fringe arguments that had no validity.

441
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:52,219
They were valid arguments and I think everyone was well aware of them.

442
00:56:52,219 --> 00:57:08,219
In Cameron I think Cameron made, I think he said one time that at first he thought they were just dealing with fools and then he realized they were dealing with naves as he put it.

443
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:18,219
You mentioned very briefly in 1970 if the clinic had a risk that the cancer would set up a clinic for diagnosing and treating disease as it must have long been possible.

444
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:24,219
Well it predated my arrival at the institute so I don't really have a lot of firsthand knowledge about the clinic.

445
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:34,219
I know that the concept there was clear that some people might benefit from orthomolecular medical treatment.

446
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:47,219
But I think the funding and liability issues were, the funding was too low and the liability issues were too great to really turn that into a practical functional concern.

447
00:57:47,219 --> 00:58:01,219
And I do remember Kareen Gorham and others telling me that there were people who showed up knocking on the door, Deathly Ill, and spent their last money on a bus ticket to get there and had no money and expected to be cured.

448
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:06,219
And that was not uncommon and that of course just was not possible.

449
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:16,219
So I think rather than risk having the tail wag the dog they decided to dissolve the clinic rather quickly.

450
00:58:16,219 --> 00:58:17,219
What was it?

451
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:20,219
It was located within the building as I understand.

452
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:23,219
And Frank Catchpool was part of that.

453
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:33,219
And Catchpool I got to know off and on because he even when the clinic finished he was still loosely involved with the institute from time to time.

454
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:41,219
And I think he was practicing right up until the end of his life in Marine County, maybe in Sausolito, California.

455
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:46,219
And he really liked Pauling and I think Pauling really liked him quite a lot as well.

456
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:50,219
He spoke at Pauling's memorial service at Stanford Church.

457
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:53,219
Did you ever talk to him about his life?

458
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:55,219
Quite an interesting way.

459
00:58:55,219 --> 00:59:03,219
I probably talked to him about his work in Africa of course where I think Pauling first met him.

460
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:06,219
Albert Schweitzer's camp there.

461
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:11,219
I can't remember those discussions very carefully now though.

462
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:22,219
Well we talked about this kind of off the line throughout the interview but I'm wondering if you could give a little bit more on the kind of the chronic money problems that you've had since you've faced for a very long time.

463
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:31,219
Yeah well the institute was I think founded and moved off the campus of Stanford University initially because there wasn't enough money.

464
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:40,219
Nor was there enough space at Stanford to carry out the work that Pauling really felt would make a big impact in public health, namely research and orthomolecular medicine.

465
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:43,219
Specifically research on vitamin C.

466
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:52,219
And I think Pauling and Robinson felt that this had great potential as did the metabolite profiling metabolic profiling program.

467
00:59:52,219 --> 01:00:02,219
So they moved, they founded the institute, moved to this location that we've talked about in Menlo Park and then set about trying to raise money to carry out this research.

468
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:13,219
And government grants were not forthcoming for the vitamin C work although the metabolite metabolic profiling work was supported to a large extent by government grants in those days.

469
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:22,219
The development of the apparatus, data analysis, data collection, sample collection, things like that.

470
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:45,219
And then as the institute started to grow the need for more resources, financial resources became pretty clear and that's when art Robinson and Rick Hicks got involved in this direct mail solicitation program because they correctly perceived that the public had responded to Pauling's message and thoughts about vitamin C and health.

471
01:00:45,219 --> 01:01:04,219
Much more quickly than the medical community and the scientific community. So there were lots of people out there who believed that Pauling was right about vitamin C and wanted to sort of support the David versus the Goliath, Pauling versus the Convention, the Convention on Medical Establishment.

472
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:26,219
So they were willing to give small and large donations to support research at the institute. So in a way that was very good because it allowed the institute to hire staff scientists without tenure of course but hire them and provide them with money to carry out research that was not dependent on government grants or corporate sponsorship.

473
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:33,219
Although throughout the history of the institute, corporate sponsorship and contracts were quite variable.

474
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:52,219
The Hoffman-LaRose gave money, the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation gave money. So there were corporate and organizational sources of funding for the institute but sometimes they were restricted and sometimes they were non-restricted.

475
01:01:52,219 --> 01:02:01,219
Luckily the money from some of those large donors was unrestricted and could be applied across the board to support whatever line is Pauling.

476
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:07,219
Art Robins and Ray Neel Zucicondle felt was important.

477
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:27,219
But because of, excuse me, because of the stock market performance and the vagaries of the national economy over years that affected the ability of individuals to some extent corporations to give money.

478
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:37,219
It affected their philanthropic abilities. So when there were down times during recessions and other down times people gave less money.

479
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:56,219
Nevertheless, at the institute the costs were constant or increasing. So in those times there was always a pinch. And that would often be resolved transiently by decreasing contributions to pension plans or salary reductions that were temporary.

480
01:02:56,219 --> 01:03:07,219
So they would be lifted once the economic picture brightens somewhat. So it was always kind of a roller coaster depending upon what was going on in the national economy.

481
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:20,219
Because when you're a charitable organization depending upon the philanthropy of others, the economic climate affects the ability to give. And we certainly were aware of that.

482
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:36,219
Later, as I said, when the Mayo Clinic studies on vitamin C and cancer were published, that also caused transient loss in funds available to the institute because people were giving less money because they felt now vitamin C had failed to show anything.

483
01:03:36,219 --> 01:04:03,219
Why support that kind of research? And still later when people became aware of Pauling's interest in work in HIV infection, AIDS, and vitamin C, that also caused transient loss in support because some people were opposed to that work on moral grounds and didn't want to see that kind of research funded at the institute.

484
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:13,219
And it strikes me that there couldn't have been many organizations like LDSM, where scientific research that were within the event there weren't funds for it.

485
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:28,219
I don't think there were. And interestingly enough, in the early 1990s, John Levit, who had been the director of the Molecular Carson and Genesis Laboratory, calculated the impact factor for the institution.

486
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:35,219
So impact factors can be calculated for journals, they can be calculated for scientists, they can also be calculated for institutions.

487
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:48,219
And I believe the result of John's analysis at that time ranked the institute in the top 15 nonprofit biomedical research institutes in the country on the basis of impact factor.

488
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:58,219
And I should add that that was not all related to Linus Pauling's productivity. Lots of papers from institute staff figured in the calculation of the impact factor.

489
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:09,219
So despite the fact that there were financial problems throughout the institute's career, I think ultimately in terms of productivity and influence, I think it succeeded.

490
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:15,219
Surprisingly well given the its size and lack of resources.

491
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:20,219
Over at 65 minutes do you want to do a few more questions?

492
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:22,219
What time is it?

493
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,219
It's 11.35.

494
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,219
Yeah, a couple more questions.

495
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:27,219
Tom Good.

496
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:35,219
So in 1980, the institute moved from the Molecular Carson for 40 pages and all those and all of those. What precipitated this?

497
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:47,219
Well my understanding at the time was that the building owned by Tom Ford in which the institute had been located was Premier League office building.

498
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:56,219
And it was on loosely packed sedimentary soils.

499
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:04,219
And over time because of earthquake activity, you know related to the San Andreas fault seismic activity in that whole area,

500
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:09,219
there had been some structural problems with the building.

501
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:20,219
And I believe that the owner wanted to evict everyone to fix the building structurally.

502
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:30,219
And probably did not want to invite the Linus Pauling is to back because he could make much more money by renting that space to paper companies.

503
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:38,219
And so people were doing lab research and whose financial outlook was sometimes sketchy at best.

504
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:51,219
So that precipitated a search by institute administrators Rick Hicks and Emil Zuck Kondel in particular to find a facility in which the institute carry out research.

505
01:06:51,219 --> 01:07:05,219
Which led them to this old battery factory, Cinderblock construction at 440 page mill road that didn't require a great deal of renovation in order to accommodate the institute's work.

506
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:10,219
There was some renovation in laboratories.

507
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:27,219
We had a class biologically clean room that we had to design for large scale rat mouse work of a variant where we were housing guinea pigs and other animals for some vitamin C research.

508
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:40,219
So the move was made to that facility and we were on very good terms with the new landlords who increased the rent only dependent on the CPI increase every year or every couple years.

509
01:07:40,219 --> 01:07:48,219
So they weren't out to make a killing by escalating the rent to the point where we would have to move and they would get some other tenant in there.

510
01:07:48,219 --> 01:08:01,219
They seem to have some feeling for the institute's mission and admiration for Linus Pauling and wanted to make it as easy as possible for the institute to remain in that building.

511
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:09,219
So it sounds like in financial terms of the positive move and the space itself, what were you in there?

512
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:14,219
Well, there was much more square footage available to us in this building.

513
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:24,219
The building itself was pretty shabby compared to the nice office building that we left in Menel Park.

514
01:08:24,219 --> 01:08:29,219
As I said, it was a Cinderblock construction, kind of an ugly building, really nothing to look at.

515
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:37,219
Definitely not a showcase building, but it was functional and the offices were fine and we were able to carry out the scientific work.

516
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,220
So that was fine. It suited us at the time.

517
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:59,220
And we moved everything ourselves. Alan Sheetz, who was about chemist working at the institute, his father had been a professional mover in Idaho and Alan had spent a lot of his boyhood years in college years doing summer jobs moving for his father's company.

518
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:04,220
So he really knew about moving equipment and offices and laboratories and so forth.

519
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:17,220
So Alan really coordinated our move from one facility to the other and we rented a bunch of big trucks and hand trucks and blankets and all the other material that we needed to move and basically did it ourselves.

520
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:20,220
I saved a lot of money.

521
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:26,220
Were there any special considerations over the senior, with the science of the apparatus?

522
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,220
Oh yeah. Everything was moved very carefully, of course.

523
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:36,220
And we had to close the experimental work and then lock down all the instruments.

524
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:45,220
And it was a challenge to move some of these things, but nevertheless we did it and vendors would come in and recalibrate our centrifuges and other equipment.

525
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,220
So we managed to get it all done.

526
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:54,220
And at the time we had quite a few reasonably young men on staff.

527
01:09:54,220 --> 01:10:00,220
So we had quite a lot of muscle power at the time and we could do this.

528
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:09,220
And then can maybe two of the institutes to give up the first line of point level for humanitarian use?

529
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:17,220
Well of course at that time I was not an administration. I was just in research so I didn't really have any insight into the nature of this award.

530
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,220
I mean I was aware of the awards and the ceremonies and so forth.

531
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:29,220
And the candidates all seem to be uniformly deserving of the award, but it always seemed to me to have a bit of a fundraising component to it.

532
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:40,220
And I think probably if you asked the people who had set up these awards and the occasions I think they would probably admit that there was a fundraising component.

533
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:46,220
What was the nature of the electrical conservatory in 1993?

534
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,220
Literal?

535
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:54,220
Again I didn't have a lot of familiarity with that at the time.

536
01:10:54,220 --> 01:11:08,220
I know that Pauline believed that there may be some validity to Leotrull and he thought that there was enough biological plausibility that studies should be undertaken.

537
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:24,220
I don't think he had a firm opinion that yes Leotrull is definitely valuable in treating cancer, but I think he was calling for more research to really get to the bottom of whether or not this was going to be useful in cancer therapy.

538
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,220
Other than that I really was not too aware of the controversy at the time.

539
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:33,220
And that thing actually went on with the Institute of Human Services and Investigation.

540
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,220
Not that I can remember.

541
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:45,220
No. One program that I got involved with just backtracking slightly with you in Cameron was Cameron of course, and maybe I talked about this earlier, I can't remember.

542
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:55,220
Cameron was very interested in whether or not vitamin C would affect chemotherapy drug activity in the body.

543
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:06,220
And he was concerned that cancer patients who were taking chemotherapy drugs that were designed to be effective in halting the spread of cancer or attacking the primary tumor.

544
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:19,220
He didn't want those people to take simultaneously high dose vitamin C if the vitamin C was going to neutralize the effectiveness of the chemotherapy drugs because vitamin C has some general detoxifying capabilities.

545
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:29,220
And it can interfere with certain drug actions. So he was very concerned about that and he wasn't sure whether vitamin C would or would not affect chemotherapy drugs.

546
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:42,220
So we set up an experiment Alan Sheetz and I with you in Cameron and Len McPherson to look at the effect on fingerling trout of chemotherapy drugs and vitamin C.

547
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:52,220
Because you can monitor the movement of fish which relates to their physiology and biochemical activity and I guess how they're feeling as well.

548
01:12:52,220 --> 01:13:09,220
So the idea was to measure fish movement in fish that had been exposed to drugs like method trexate with and with that vitamin C to see if the vitamin C was interfering with the drug action in the fish.

549
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:15,220
The last thing I want to ask you about today is calling in relationship with the biochemical assessor color.

550
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:23,220
So we talked a bit about this foundation and definitely should go into foundation and we might understand if the date done is running for instance.

551
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:32,220
So it's also got something in the controversial figure that something we know is ever discussed in the Institute or if they are identified in a source of funds.

552
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:44,220
I think some people were aware of Sussex Alice controversial history in Japan.

553
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:51,220
I was aware that he made at least some fortune for motorboat racing in Japan.

554
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:58,220
That didn't really bother me much. I wasn't that familiar with some of the other accusations levied against him at the time.

555
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:24,220
To be honest with you, I think that the magnitude of the gift from Sussex Gawa Foundation affected what we were able to do at the Institute so dramatically that I think most people either chose not to think too carefully about his history and just accept the money which I believe was about $500,000 a year for 10 years.

556
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:32,220
A lot of that focused on aging research and we had a Sussex Gawa aging research laboratory set up at Porter Drive.

557
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:45,220
And when Sussex Gawa and his entourage would visit the Institute it was always in a long line of black limousines and many many people in dark suits that would always accompany him.

558
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:53,220
My casual observation seemed to be that he seemed to be a pretty important figure and very wealthy but I didn't really know much about him.

559
01:14:53,220 --> 01:15:03,220
I met him once and had some subsequent communication with his son and other functionaries at the foundation much later.

560
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:12,220
But I didn't really, I wasn't privy to any interactions that took place between Pauling and Sussex Gawa.
