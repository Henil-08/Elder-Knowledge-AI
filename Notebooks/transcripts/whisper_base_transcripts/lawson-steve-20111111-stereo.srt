1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Okay Steve, so as in the past, I'd introduce yourself.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,080
My name is Steve Lawson, or in a conference room in Valley Library on 11th of November

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
2011.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,359
So in our last session we talked quite a bit about the Mayo Clinic and Controversy, and

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,920
I don't know that we need to go over the details of that again, but I'm interested in knowing

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,640
a little bit more about the response from within the institute, especially if there is

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:37,640
a, there was ever a plan or an idea about developing a research program specifically in

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,960
response to what the Mayo Clinic had said.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,040
I don't think that there was a plan to develop a research project in response to the Mayo

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Clinic studies.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,920
I think that Pauling and Cameron and anyone else who was sympathetic to their position

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,040
realized that the studies purportedly done to replicate Cameron's work were very flawed.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,320
And as I mentioned last time, Cameron and Pauling were angry that the New England Journal

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,520
of Medicine, for instance, did not publish critical letters in a timely fashion.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,560
And typically medical journals will publish critical letters while the original clinical

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,359
trial or study reported in that journal is still freshening people's minds.

17
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,439
And I think Pauling actually invoked his lawyer to contact Arnold Rellman of the New England

18
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,280
Journal of Medicine to find out what had happened to the letters that had been submitted.

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,480
Because the etiquette is that when you submit a publication or a letter to a journal for

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,680
consideration, for publication in that journal, you can't submit it elsewhere.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,120
So this kind of stymied the ability of Cameron and Pauling to err their grievances about

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,160
the Mayo Clinic studies in print in a journal because they had already submitted really

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,200
cogent responses and Rellman seemed to be sitting on these for quite a long time.

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,160
I think finally they published something, but it was nearly a year after the original

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,400
study had been published.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Letters are read, but they certainly don't attract the kind of media interest that the

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,600
original study attracted.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,240
So I think Cameron and Pauling felt that they needed to continue on showing that vitamin

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,439
C had value because they were both convinced by this time that vitamin C had value for many

30
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,760
cancer patients.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,800
And Pauling was also becoming a little after the second Mayo Clinic trial.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:43,200
He had heard from Abram Hauffer, the Canadian psychiatrist who had stimulated his interest

33
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:50,280
in B vitamins and schizophrenia back in the early 1960s or mid 1960s that Hauffer had

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,439
been treating cancer patients with high dose vitamin C given orally as well as an expanded

35
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,439
treatment regimen that included B vitamins, fatty acids, zinc and some other micronutrients.

36
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,879
And these cancer patients seem to be doing quite well.

37
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,759
So Pauling encouraged Hauffer to collect that data with the intent of analyzing it and

38
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,919
publishing it.

39
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,919
And they did that.

40
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,599
They published two papers in the Journal of Worth and Molecular Medicine on Hauffer's

41
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,599
observation.

42
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,359
So I think that this was not a response to the Mayo Clinic trials per se, but a continuation

43
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:31,599
of Pauling's deep interest in vitamin C and cancer.

44
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,000
And Hauffer had been, Hauffer is an MD-PhD as a psychiatrist by training in profession.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,519
And you might wonder why he was treating cancer patients.

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,640
Well, it turns out that many cancer patients, especially when given a diagnosis, prognosis

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,040
of terminal cancer, developed psychological problems, depression, anxiety, whatnot.

48
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,760
And they were being referred to Hauffer by oncologists in Vancouver and Victoria in British

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,320
Columbia to treat these mental manifestations that accompanied the bad news about the

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,240
cancer diagnosis.

51
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,840
So Hauffer began treating these people for mental health issues and kind of serendipitously

52
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,360
observed that they were living much longer in many cases than they were expected to live

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,240
by their oncologists.

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,160
And he brought that observation to Pauling who encouraged him then to collect the data.

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,920
So Cameron and Pauling continued to be very interested in vitamin C and cancer.

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,800
And I think was a bit discouraged by the political implications of this whole embryo at the

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Mayo Clinic.

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
And I think he became very frustrated and discouraged.

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,640
And his attention was also turned elsewhere.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,920
He was very interested in fatty acids and cancer and had set up a project at the Institute

61
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:59,200
to study the effect of oral fats in animals in a tumor model.

62
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,959
And he was also becoming more and more interested in AIDS and the potential value of high dose

63
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,839
vitamin C in treating AIDS patients.

64
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,399
And as you know, he and Pauling worked on a book together that absorbed quite a lot of

65
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,519
Cameron's time and attention in those last years, which was never published.

66
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:26,039
Can you talk a little more about the fatty acids, Lyonid research?

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Cameron, I believe, had known or knew of David Horabin's work in England.

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,120
And Horabin had written a book on omega-3 fatty acids.

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,520
He was a researcher and I believe he was also a clinician who was very interested in the

70
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,800
health, sort of the orthomolecular approach to health using fatty acids and other micronutrients.

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,000
But he was particularly interested in fatty acids and brain function.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,800
And Horabin, when I saw him at some point in the 1980s or early 1990s, had reported on

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,439
a clinical trial, preliminary clinical trial done in England with, I believe, schizophrenia

74
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,959
who were given fatty acids supplementation and MRIs or computer tomography had been done

75
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,959
of their brains.

76
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:23,839
And they found that the ventricular spaces shrunk as a result of ingestion of these fatty

77
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,199
acids over a period of time, which also correlated with some symptomatic improvement.

78
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,560
So Horabin and Cameron, I think, too, were becoming very interested in the psychiatric

79
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
application of fatty acids.

80
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,079
And then from epidemiological studies and rodent studies, it's been known for a long

81
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,159
time that omega-6 fatty acids, polyinsaturated fatty acids may augment tumor development

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,760
in some rodent models.

83
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,360
And there may be a protective effect by omega-3 fats.

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,120
So I think Cameron was interested in teasing apart those effects of different types of fatty

85
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
acids in a mouse model.

86
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,600
And that's an experiment that was set up at the Institute.

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes.

88
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,560
In 1986, how to live longer in fuel better is published?

89
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,400
Is this something that the L.P.I. staff was part of it all over the whole of the

90
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,359
underlying projects until himself?

91
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,359
Excuse me.

92
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:27,120
Dorothy Monroe, of course, helped him with that because she was his secretary and she worked

93
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,519
a lot on that book.

94
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,919
And I think he had helped perhaps from Fred Stitt, maybe some other people at the Institute,

95
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,159
but it wasn't an institute-wide effort.

96
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,599
It was done by Linus Pauling.

97
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,120
I think Stella Kerman probably helped him in getting references and things of that nature

98
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
too.

99
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,600
As far as I know, Pauling himself produced the draft.

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,120
And I believe he shared that probably with some people, including Fred Stitt, for proof

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,040
reading and suggestions and so forth.

102
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,120
But I think it was largely his project.

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,079
And he directed that the royalties from that book come to the Linus Pauling Institute

104
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,399
of Science and Medicine because he undertook the book as an employee of the Linus Pauling

105
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,399
Institute.

106
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,879
It wasn't something he was doing on his own for financial gain.

107
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
He really wanted that money to come to the Institute to support research.

108
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,560
What sort of reaction did you know in response to the book, people that were getting a hold

109
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,719
of the Linus Pauling Institute?

110
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,959
Well, there seemed to be a lot of interest in the book.

111
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,920
The original hardcover was published by WH Freeman.

112
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,159
That wasn't around long.

113
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:41,039
Then there was a paperback also published by Freeman that was a, what would you call it,

114
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
a trade paperback?

115
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,959
It was larger than a regular pocketbook paperback.

116
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,799
And that seemed to sell very well in addition.

117
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:56,120
And then shortly after the Freeman editions, the mass market paperback rights were auctioned

118
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,439
and Avan was the successful bidder.

119
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:05,240
And it went, I think it was the best seller for Avan as well and went through many, many,

120
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,559
many printings.

121
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,319
So people really responded to the book.

122
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,560
I mean, I think it was in the New York Times bestseller list for a while.

123
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm not sure what the rank was or for how long, but it sold very, very well.

124
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,000
And I don't think that the main impact was financial revenue for the Institute to carry

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,120
out research, but more of an awareness of Pauling's ideas in orthomolecular medicine and

126
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,560
the fact that a lot of this research was going on in California at the Linus Pauling Institute.

127
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,080
So it definitely directed attention to the Institute.

128
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,600
But of course, this was before the internet.

129
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,759
So people reading the book and wanting to learn more about the possible impact of vitamin

130
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,000
C and other vitamins and nutritionally essential minerals and so forth on cognitive function

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,519
or health, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and cancer and so forth would typically

132
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,800
call or write to the Institute.

133
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,480
And that of course resulted in a huge enterprise.

134
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Because we didn't have very many staff to deal with all these letters that would come in.

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,680
And you and Cameron, who had been non-resident fellow in the Institute, I think moved to California

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,519
to take up position as medical director maybe around 1984, 1985, somewhere in that mid-1980

137
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,519
period.

138
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,440
And as I said earlier, a lot of his effort was directed at responding to these letters

139
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,760
and phone calls from people with medical problems who wanted to know about the therapeutic

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,520
value of micronutrients, especially vitamin C.

141
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,320
And Fred Stitt also helped in that area quite a lot.

142
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,440
Fred had joined the Institute as a volunteer in the early 1980s.

143
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,400
He had known Pauling at Caltech and was actually thanked in Pauling's book on the chemical

144
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,320
bond, Nature of the Chemical Bond.

145
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,600
So he and Pauling had a long relationship.

146
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,680
Fred was retired and had an office at the Institute and Fred became the newsletter editor and

147
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,720
also helped develop some standardized information packets that the Institute could send out to

148
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,200
people who had, because at that point the volume of mail and requests was so large that oftentimes

149
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,360
these things couldn't be handled on a personal basis because it was just overwhelming.

150
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,840
Some of the questions were very peculiar or idiosyncratic and required a little bit of

151
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,919
work to answer a little research to find out what the appropriate response would be.

152
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,720
Some other questions were a little more generic and these information packets were designed

153
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,320
and made to answer those more generic questions.

154
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,240
And Fred was heavily involved in that, putting together these different generic packets that

155
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,080
could go out to people.

156
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,800
So he vetted that mail for the most part?

157
00:11:53,799 --> 00:12:02,359
Fred and you and Karen Mren and Dorothy Monroe, I think Carol Bestelier had been doing this

158
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:07,759
at Sandhill Road Facility and I don't think that she was still part of the institute

159
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,759
in the 1980s when we moved to the Page Mail Road Facility.

160
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:18,219
But she had been doing a lot of that in Sandhill Road and actually she identified quite a

161
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,219
few issues.

162
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,459
I think that we're very important for people to think about, especially with respect to

163
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:30,060
liability, trying not to provide medical advice but being compassionate and being helpful

164
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,860
to people but also not trying to tell them what to do medically because of course we couldn't

165
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,540
do anything like that.

166
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,660
And Carol struggled with a lot of those issues and sort of laid the groundwork for a successful

167
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,139
strategy for answering these kinds of questions.

168
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,039
Interesting, the camera was so closely involved considering his pretty heavy research

169
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,039
to do.

170
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,699
Yeah, well I think he enjoyed it.

171
00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:04,500
He definitely was interested in research but he really was a patient-oriented doctor.

172
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,939
He would have been a terrific doctor to have for personal care because he was very compassionate.

173
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,899
He was a good listener.

174
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:17,679
And he was not at all afflicted by the kind of arrogant or rushed attitude that you find

175
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,980
in many contemporary physicians just because the insurance reimbursement for physicians

176
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,340
can be, can dictate how medical practice is actually done in this country and doctors

177
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,779
aren't allowed to spend much time with patients.

178
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,220
Cameron was not like that at all.

179
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,660
He was much more old school and really like to listen to people and their problems and

180
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,060
then think about what the appropriate treatment or response would be.

181
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:53,779
So I think that responding to the public who brought these health questions or concerns

182
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,100
to the institute, I think he enjoyed that.

183
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,540
So in 1987 we mentioned this a little bit already but the vitamin C and AIDS research

184
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:07,539
starts to make a little bit more of a good describe what that research was.

185
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:15,240
Yeah, to the best of my recollection, Rex C. Jerawalla had come to the institute from Johns

186
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,980
Hopkins and I believe he knew John Levit at Johns Hopkins as well.

187
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,740
John Levit had joined the institute to direct our molecular carcinogenesis program which

188
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,779
again really didn't have anything to do with orthomolecular medicine.

189
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:41,459
It was more looking at, as I said molecular carcinogenesis, how genes and certain proteins

190
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,179
can be involved in the development of the cancer phenotype.

191
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,620
He was particularly interested in a mutant beta actin which seemed to be a reliable marker

192
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,980
for many types of human cancer and used protein profiling extensively to do quantitative and

193
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,340
qualitative studies of these gene products that seemed to correlate with cancer.

194
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:10,100
So Rex C. was a virologist and he set up the laboratory for viral carcinogenesis because

195
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,940
his initial interest was in Cetamigallo viral carcinogenesis and carcinogenesis due to

196
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,220
Herpes virus type 2 infection because it was known at the time that infection with HSV

197
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,820
increased the risk for certain types of gynecologic cancers in women.

198
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm not sure that it's related to any increased cancer risk for men but there was an increased

199
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,660
cancer risk for women and I worked with him to some degree in that program.

200
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:49,940
We were looking at small fragments of Herpes virus type 2 DNA that were sufficient to cause

201
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,260
transformation of rat cells.

202
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,220
So we would grow rat 2 cells which are quasi-normal cells in culture and then transfect them with

203
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,640
these small viral fragments from Herpes virus type 2 and look to see if there were any

204
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,780
observable changes in these rat cells.

205
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:15,100
We found the PST 2 or 3 C segment was sufficient to cause the rat 2 cells to become over tumor

206
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,940
forming cells when injected into animals.

207
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,460
We also did a lot of protein profiling.

208
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,620
I had expertise in protein profiling at that time and rat C really didn't so that was

209
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,580
what I brought to his project.

210
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:37,259
And together we also worked on a program that was supported by a philanthropist from Long

211
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,500
Island, New York on Phytoc acid which is found in seeds.

212
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,379
An antioxidant that protects seeds from oxidation because seeds need to store their genetic

213
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,220
program very carefully and be free from oxidative damage while they're waiting to germinate until

214
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,940
the conditions are right for germination.

215
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,419
Phytoc acid plays a very important role in protecting the seed genome.

216
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,500
And this fellow in New York had decided that it may have some anti-cancer effects.

217
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:12,779
So we were testing the anti-cancer effect of Phytoc acid in Syrian hamster embryos cells

218
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:14,859
and a number of other tumor cell lines.

219
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,779
I was doing a lot of that work, the cell culture work.

220
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,900
And that generated a few papers including papers that showed that Phytoc acid seemed to

221
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:31,900
affect cholesterol levels in animals and triglyceride levels in particular and also could inhibit

222
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,780
metal-induced carcinogenesis in animals.

223
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,900
We had a patent awarded for that particular work.

224
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,860
So rexet was pretty well versed in cell culture and virology and carcinogenesis.

225
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:54,500
And of course in the 1980s being close to San Francisco, everyone was well aware of this

226
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,100
new syndrome that was primarily affecting male homosexuals.

227
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:05,579
Although there seemed to be, I think at that time, some incidents in hemophiliax2 who

228
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:12,419
were undergoing blood transfusions, but the etiologic agent responsible for this age-ades

229
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:20,419
related, Arachia can't remember exactly what the C stands for in that, but it was a syndrome

230
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,019
that preceded overt AIDS.

231
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:30,139
So people would, of course, it wasn't known that HIV was responsible for AIDS at that time.

232
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:39,820
So there's a lot of concern about AIDS, Arach and how infectious this disease might be.

233
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,100
And there was a lot of emphasis on things like drug use and sex habits by male homosexuals

234
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,380
that may contribute to immunodeficiency.

235
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,900
So people weren't sure if it was a behavior, etiology, or whether there was some kind of pathogen

236
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
involved.

237
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,180
For time, of course, in the 1980s, it became clear from Montennyay's work in France and

238
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:07,220
also Gallos work in the United States that, aha, there is actually an infectious agent here

239
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,019
of virus that's probably responsible for causing AIDS.

240
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:19,100
And then cells were available that were infected with this virus, HIV.

241
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,939
We did, we're actually did a lot of work with Steve Herike, who was from Lebanon, N-Line

242
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:33,339
is Pauling, looking at the effect of vitamin C added to the culture medium in which telemphasites

243
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,219
infected with HIV were grown.

244
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:41,579
So they wanted to find out whether vitamin C would have any effect on viability of the virus

245
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,980
or replication of the virus.

246
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,900
And they found that it really affected viral replication, very potentally, dramatically

247
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,420
inhibited viral replication.

248
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:59,539
And that was assayed by amounts of reverse transcriptase and also the formation of syncytia,

249
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:08,900
which are abnormal cells that are sort of pathologic correlates of telemphasite infection.

250
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,819
So that led to a paper that was published in PNAS with three of them as authors.

251
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:17,379
I think Pauling was a senior author and Gerowall was perhaps the first author.

252
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:21,259
And that paper presented the results of these cell culture experiments.

253
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:27,179
Wasn't any clinical data, but they suggested that this might provide a promising approach

254
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,899
for the treatment of AIDS, namely by that time AZT had been come available to for treatment

255
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,539
of AIDS patients.

256
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:42,299
AZT is pretty effective at inhibiting the denobo infection of uninfected cells.

257
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,460
So you give AZT to patients and you preserve those uninfected cells from becoming infected

258
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,980
with a virus.

259
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,980
So vitamin C prevents viral replication.

260
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,059
So the idea was that if you give AZT and vitamin C, then you're inhibiting viral replication

261
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,859
and you're protecting, if there is a little bit of viral replication, you're also inhibiting

262
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,899
those new cells from becoming infected.

263
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:08,099
So the idea was that this might really, if it didn't eradicate the virus and kill the

264
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:15,259
cells that were infected with a virus, at least it could cause AIDS to become a manageable

265
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:19,299
disease, perhaps.

266
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,459
So what part of carrying involved?

267
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:26,459
Well I think Cameron got involved because obviously there were medical issues involved

268
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:30,939
here and he was Gerowall had a PhD but didn't have a medical degree.

269
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:36,500
The only other person at the institute, we had a veterinarian, Roger Barth, and Wilcott

270
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,339
had done him, had an MD and Wilcott was doing some work with guinea pigs and neural

271
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,299
atherism at the time.

272
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:50,299
But he was pretty advanced in age at that time and was not physically very vigorous.

273
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,299
And Cameron was still very vigorous and of course very interesting a lot of these issues.

274
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,900
And I think through conversations with Gerowall and Paul and Cameron just naturally

275
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,740
gravitated to that, especially once it had been demonstrated that vitamin C might have

276
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,420
an important role to play there.

277
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:15,259
So what was the reaction to this research both in the scientific community and the public?

278
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:22,460
Well I can't really say that I know what the reaction was in the scientific community.

279
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:28,019
I think by then maybe many people thought that line is Pauling was going to just publish

280
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,460
great stuff about vitamin C no matter what and that we'd never find anything coming from

281
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,140
the Pauling Institute that had anything to do with a negative effect of vitamin C.

282
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,900
Just so happens that all these experiments were positive.

283
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,420
So vitamin C is not snake oil but it does have a lot of very important and interesting

284
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,380
biochemical and physiological functions in the body and protecting against and treating

285
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,539
different diseases.

286
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:57,460
So it's not a panacea but it's a really remarkable substance and it's easy to see why line

287
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,900
is Pauling got so interested in it early on.

288
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,820
So I can't say what the professional reaction was.

289
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:12,940
I know that there were AIDS, there were doctors who treated AIDS patients who were very interested

290
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,259
in our results.

291
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:18,980
In particular there were several physicians from San Francisco general at the AIDS ward

292
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,100
there who came down to the institute and gave seminars and were in contact with Pauling

293
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,180
and Jerrowall about this.

294
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,019
There was a lot of anecdotal evidence as well from San Francisco and New York and other

295
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:35,900
major urban centers that had a lot of AIDS cases where some of the patients who were self-medicating

296
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:42,619
with high dose oral vitamin C seem to be doing a little bit better than their friends who

297
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:46,660
were not taking high dose vitamin C but there weren't any controlled clinical studies at

298
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,259
that time and I don't think to date there have been any controlled clinical trials on

299
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:55,660
vitamin C and HIV infection or AIDS.

300
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:02,259
And of course the RCTs are most persuasive when it comes to adopting new strategies in

301
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:03,259
medicine.

302
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:07,820
So absent RCTs I think probably a lot of physicians just ignored it.

303
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,300
It's in the realm of anecdotal evidence.

304
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,820
It really doesn't mean anything.

305
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
It's just coincidence.

306
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,060
You have vitamin C might have some value but it's such a pedestrian substance and I'm sure

307
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,420
that there are more promising biotherapies that we get involved in.

308
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,180
We can't completely disregard the political or financial perspectives in that whole debate

309
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,380
either because a lot of physicians who are charged with running clinical trials to evaluate

310
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:40,900
drugs stand a benefit from financially from the revenue stream should that drug turn

311
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,940
out to be effective.

312
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,539
So a lot of people have tremendous incentive to study drug therapy and there's just not

313
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:52,180
the same type of incentive with vitamin C.

314
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,860
But public reaction I think varied.

315
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,820
Of course people who were afflicted with AIDS or had friends who were afflicted with

316
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,860
AIDS were quite interested and very appreciative of the institute's work.

317
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:14,980
Other people who were a little bit who felt for whatever moral reason that AIDS was a behavioral

318
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,700
disease and that we shouldn't really waste money studying these problems that are due

319
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,299
to behavior and if people would just change their behavior it wouldn't have to worry about

320
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,299
this.

321
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:31,940
So some of those people withdrew support and again as we saw after the negative male clinic

322
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:39,100
studies on vitamin C and cancer there was a lapse in some financial response to our

323
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,299
direct male solicitation campaign.

324
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,460
But of course that never influenced the work that we undertook.

325
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:58,779
I mean we undertook work that was fundable either from grants or contracts or from unrestricted

326
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:03,379
funds that were available to us and be quest for the direct male program but I can't ever

327
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:09,099
recall any discussion that suggested that any line of work at the institute should be stopped

328
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:16,099
because it was a negative effect on either the media where we're down, we're nullifying

329
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:26,019
it or castigating it or donors were shying away because of that work.

330
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:33,019
So I think that kind of emulates Pauling's courageous attribute and not backing down if

331
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:37,500
he felt he was right and I think the institute sort of adopted that same strategy.

332
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
So that's an important research to do and we're not going to back down just because there's

333
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
a lot of revenue.

334
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,740
You mentioned that Cameron Pauling wrote a book about the subject that was going to publish

335
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,740
to you know why that is.

336
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,819
It takes you off it around.

337
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:56,940
Well my feeling is that they wrote the book without having talked any publisher in advance

338
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,339
to find out first of all if there was any interest in the book.

339
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:08,339
So I had no publishing contract and secondly I think the book was finished or nearly finished

340
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,819
when Cameron became ill and I think his illness probably led him to pay less attention to

341
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:19,019
it or be less excited about it.

342
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:20,019
But I infer that.

343
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,339
I don't know that for sure.

344
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:26,059
So we talked earlier about the vitamin C and cancer research and the perspective from

345
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:31,179
the institute, the staff being generally on board behind the, I think it was at the

346
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,500
surface against the same level of vitamin C and age work as well.

347
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I think so.

348
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,859
I mean I never talked to anybody at the institute who expressed any scorn or negative

349
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,019
feelings about that work.

350
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:46,980
I mean I think everybody, the institute was relatively small and fairly collegial.

351
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,259
I mean there were certain tensions and conflicts that developed over time of course from time

352
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:58,059
to time as in any organization but I think people were very respectful of one another

353
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,779
when it came to the science like that.

354
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:08,019
In 1989, Mattias Rat arrived at the institute and I'm wondering if you could share your

355
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,059
first impressions of Rat?

356
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:17,259
Yeah my first impressions were that he seemed like a very knowledgeable, earnest fellow.

357
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:21,339
He clearly had developed some exciting ideas with Linus Pauling and it was great to see

358
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:27,939
Linus Pauling enthused about the Slippoprotein Vitamin C story.

359
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,779
So my initial reactions were quite favorable.

360
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:38,299
It wasn't until I became aware of some other activities that seemed to be going on outside

361
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:45,339
the purview of the institute, the Linus Park Heart Foundation and some other things which

362
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:50,619
seemed to be a little obscure and not really conducted in a transparent way that people

363
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:54,099
began to question motivation in particular.

364
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,899
Why are these other organizations being set up?

365
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,739
What are they designed to do?

366
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,139
Are they designed to compete with the Linus Plain Institute of Science and Medicine?

367
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:08,939
This is a complimentary activity and because a lot of that kind of information wasn't

368
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:16,579
forthcoming when you have kind of that black box, it generates lots of rumors and that's

369
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:21,859
unfortunate and I think that there was certainly some of that going around at the time.

370
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:27,460
Although Linus Pauling also had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and Rat was providing

371
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:35,460
some medical services for Pauling himself and I think everybody appreciated that.

372
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,779
Here was somebody at the institute that Pauling was really interested in from a scientific

373
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:44,220
standpoint and was also looking out for Pauling's physical welfare.

374
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,620
Well, I think initially everybody was quite enthused about this collaboration.

375
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,059
How do you characterize this personality?

376
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:02,620
Well I think initially you seem to be very German.

377
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,819
He didn't really seem to have a terribly great sense of humor.

378
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:18,859
He seemed to be very, I won't say solemn, but very serious minded, polite.

379
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,859
Seemed to treat people fairly.

380
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:24,899
Did he socialize with the rest of the staff?

381
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:26,899
There was some socializing.

382
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:32,740
Throughout the history of the institute, different employees and groups of people would go out

383
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,659
for dinners or lunch or go to bars on weekends or whatever and there was some of that kind

384
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,259
of activity as well.

385
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,180
What was his research program that Pauling was excited about?

386
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,820
Well, Pauling of course had been long interested in vitamin C and cardiovascular disease and

387
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,940
he'd written about this in his book, How to Live Long and Feel Better.

388
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:01,980
He'd also written about it in articles for executive health which was a tabloid type newsletter.

389
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,860
He'd also written about it for the Linus Piling Institute Science and Medicine newsletter

390
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:11,459
in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in the 1980s.

391
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:17,059
He had a long abiding interest in the possible value of vitamin C and preventing or treating

392
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:18,859
heart disease.

393
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:26,939
Rat had some specific interest and data on the potential interaction between vitamin C

394
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:33,419
and lipoprotein A which is a major constituent of atherosclerotic plaque and also risk factor

395
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,539
for heart disease.

396
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:42,220
The problem with lipoprotein A is that its levels in the blood don't seem to be amenable

397
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,180
to modification by dietary or even drug strategy.

398
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,859
They're fairly genetically determined and they're very difficult to modulate.

399
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:54,700
So there's a lot of skepticism as to where the vitamin C could actually affect lipoprotein

400
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,619
A levels in blood.

401
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:04,059
Rat had apparently some small set of clinical data that apparently showed that vitamin C

402
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:08,099
might have value in decreasing lipoprotein A levels and I think that was very interesting

403
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:10,980
to Pauline.

404
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,779
Then together they developed a hypothesis that lipoprotein A may serve as a surrogate for

405
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:22,579
vitamin C in animals including people that do not synthesize vitamin C.

406
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:27,299
There are some evidence that lipoprotein A levels in animals and people not synthesizing

407
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:33,579
vitamin C were high and lipoprotein A levels seem to be low in the blood of those animals

408
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:37,500
that were synthesizing vitamin C and that led them to think about what is lipoprotein

409
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,220
A doing that vitamin C might otherwise do in the body.

410
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,859
They believe that lipoprotein A might be synthesized by the body to contend with and repair

411
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:53,299
fishers that develop in the vascular churro due to oxidative damage or shear stress

412
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,699
and other things of that nature.

413
00:32:55,699 --> 00:33:01,500
So it might have a valuable role in repairing lesions but that because it's a very sticky

414
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:09,339
molecule it could end up developing into atherosclerotic plaque.

415
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,220
From the original hypothesis there were a number of corollaries that developed including

416
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:22,460
the potential role of lysine in helping to either decrease plaque or keylate and remove

417
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,140
lipoprotein A from the blood.

418
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,099
Pauline published in the Journal of Worth Molecular Medicine in the early 1990s three case reports

419
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:39,379
of people who had suffered from severe angina, exercised induced angina, who had had very

420
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:46,859
serious cardiovascular disease bypass and other surgical interventions and still had angina.

421
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:53,259
And they read Pauline's papers with Raff and decided to try adding lysine to their

422
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,259
regimen.

423
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,779
In some cases these people had already been taking fairly high doses of vitamin C and then

424
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,899
added lysine.

425
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,480
They weren't controlled studies so these were reported as anecdotes and the amount of

426
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,980
lysine and vitamin C was quite variable but it was on the order of 3 to 6 grams per day

427
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,460
of each and they reported fairly rapid relief from angina.

428
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:21,220
So Pauline speculated that perhaps because the relief was so rapid that lysine might even

429
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,940
bind to lipoprotein A in plaque and help remove it from plaque and that was possibly explaining

430
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,420
why these people were not suffering from angina because the thickness of the plaque was

431
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
decreasing.

432
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,900
Well it turns out subsequent research has revealed that vitamin C has very important effects

433
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:44,220
in vasodilation and sort of improving blood flow in people with atherosclerotic plaque

434
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,579
through its effects on tetrahedribyopterine which is involved in synthesis of nitric oxide

435
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:52,619
which improves blood flow.

436
00:34:52,940 --> 00:35:00,099
The role of lysine in this process is still obscure and I don't think other than Pauline's

437
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,980
hypothesis I don't think there's been much speculation as to why lysine in particular

438
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,480
might have had this benefit because as I mentioned some of the people that were reported

439
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,579
in these case studies had already been taking very high dose vitamin C without presumably

440
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,500
any benefit yet when they added lysine there seemed to be a fairly dramatic effect.

441
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,940
So that I thought was a very, it's an interesting area and probably a rich area for research

442
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,659
although as far as I know no one's really looked into it.

443
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:35,099
So those were some of the ideas that Pauline and Wrath were developing in that period that

444
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:42,579
I think were exciting to everybody and as I came to understand the Linus-Pong Heart Foundation

445
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:50,819
was specifically set up to raise money to support clinical trials on some of these potential

446
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:54,579
therapies including proline lysine, vitamin C, niacin and so forth.

447
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,579
We'll talk more about Wrath here in a second.

448
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:03,579
There's a couple things that happen chronologically that I want to touch on first.

449
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:11,380
In 1999 there was a rezoning effort in Palo Alto which time the city gave the Institute

450
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
three years to move basically.

451
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,380
What was the reaction to that and how did you start applying for that?

452
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,380
Well that was very interesting.

453
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,980
That was about the same time that Emil Zuckakondle and Rick Hicks retired from the Linus-Pong Institute

454
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,579
of Science and Medicine and set up the Institute for Molecular Medical Sciences and we leased

455
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:35,380
them space within the facility at 440 Page Mill Road to do that.

456
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
So that was a very contentious time.

457
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,380
Emil and Rick Hicks left the Institute.

458
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Emil still had strong interest in preserving a research program and yet didn't have a lot

459
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
of funding available to him.

460
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:58,380
So Pauline wanted us to find out whether or not us meaning Stephen Maddox, myself and Z

461
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,380
Kerman to find out whether this was practical and feasible to subtly space in Linus-Pong

462
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,380
Juniors involved in that as well.

463
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,619
To subtly space to IMMS within the building and how the building might be partitioned and

464
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:16,780
how equipment might be made available to IMMS or how they could share equipment and so

465
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
on and so forth.

466
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:23,940
So that was kind of a contentious time at the Institute but resulted in a subtly

467
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:31,220
to IMMS because we found a way to make everything work to everyone's satisfaction.

468
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:38,059
And at about that time I had become executive officer of the Institute and was working

469
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:46,779
very closely with Linus-Pong Juniors because Linus-Pong senior was undergoing treatment

470
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:53,359
for cancer and still had problems in structural chemistry and theoretical chemistry and

471
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,539
orthomolecular medicine that he really wanted to devote his time to.

472
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:02,300
So Linus-Pong junior in the board decided to free his father from administrative responsibilities

473
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,059
and Linus-Pong junior would sort of step in as president or director of the Institute

474
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:12,539
and I would assist him and initially I was asked by Linus-Pong to assist him and then

475
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:18,940
later when it became clear that he wasn't really interested in exercising any administrative

476
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
responsibility.

477
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,980
Linus-Pong junior stepped in and then I worked very closely with Linus-Pong junior.

478
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,219
And that was my first understanding of the fact that the Institute had this zoning problem

479
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:34,659
and apparently it had been known for a long time that nobody had really done much about

480
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:35,980
it.

481
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:44,940
So Linus-Pong junior and I and the board realized that absent an endowment and a lot of money,

482
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,820
it was really going to be difficult for us to sustain the Institute as a viable biomedical

483
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:57,860
research organization if we had to move because we had a very favorable leasing arrangement

484
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,260
with our landlords.

485
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:06,980
The cost of the lease went up only adjusted by CPI, the consumer price index.

486
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:13,220
So we were paying I think 50 or 55 cents a square foot for 20,000 plus square foot building

487
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,460
in Palo Alto.

488
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:24,659
And to move we would have been looking at probably 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, $12 a square foot.

489
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:30,079
So the prospect of moving was not very satisfying because it meant that we would be spending

490
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,760
much more money on just simply renting a facility and not have much money available to

491
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,220
pay staff, recruit or do research.

492
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,860
So that was not an appealing option at all.

493
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,460
But we were suddenly aware that we had three years and we really had to leave because the

494
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:54,460
master plan in Palo Alto called for changing the mix of commercial and residential properties

495
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,740
because they were becoming very concerned that there weren't enough residential units

496
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,660
for people that worked in Palo Alto.

497
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,620
And it's kind of a, I don't want to go off on a tangent, but I had long discussions with

498
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:14,219
city planners, city staff, the planning committee for Palo Alto and some of the council members.

499
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:17,539
And my opinion at the time was, well, that's fine.

500
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:21,460
You can build condominiums or apartment buildings here, but there's no way you can ensure that

501
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,139
the people who rent or buy these condos or apartment buildings are going to work in Palo

502
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:29,859
Alto because Palo Alto is a very desirable address.

503
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,819
People might move here and work in Sunnyvale or San Francisco or Hayward or East Bay or

504
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,940
the South Bay and you're just going to increase traffic and it's going to become not necessarily

505
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,620
the outcome that you're striving for with this zoning change.

506
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:48,539
But be that as it may, we really had to face the inevitable, which was the zoning was going

507
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:52,019
to change.

508
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:58,660
So I decided that it was imperative to delay that until we could really come up with

509
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,100
a proper solution for the institute's future.

510
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:09,099
And taking a page out of Linus Pauling and Eva Helen's book, we set up folding tables

511
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:14,619
around town outside grocery stores and cafes and had petitions.

512
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:17,420
And I can't remember the exact wording of the petition, but it was something to the

513
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
effect.

514
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,219
Please sign the petition if you'd like to see the institute stay at its location in Palo

515
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:26,539
Alto if you feel that we're doing good work and so on and so forth.

516
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:32,139
We had quite a few names signed in those petitions and they were eventually delivered to the

517
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:37,659
City Council and I made a presentation in the City Council.

518
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:42,579
Linus Pauling made a presentation in the City Council and eventually we squeak through

519
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:49,900
with City Council approval to delay that zoning change for a period of time because they

520
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:56,299
recognized that we were doing valuable work and that we really needed more time to chart

521
00:41:56,299 --> 00:41:58,779
a proper course for the future.

522
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,980
And as one of the Palo Alto City Council members mentioned, she didn't want to read the New

523
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:09,980
York Times that the City of Palo Alto had kicked the Linus Pauling Institute out of town.

524
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
That's interesting.

525
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,620
I had never heard that before.

526
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,740
Yeah, so that was a very successful campaign and I should mention that during these City

527
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,980
Council meeting appearances, you know, I felt well, it's good and fine for me to go

528
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,740
and talk to the City Council and I'd met all of the City Council members individually

529
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:31,579
and pleaded our case to them and they seemed to be favorably disposed to the institute

530
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:35,459
although some of them were wavering somewhat.

531
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:40,019
And I figured that I could make a pretty compelling argument in front of the City Council during

532
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:44,619
public testimony, but I thought it would really sent you to line as Pauling himself could

533
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:48,659
appear and I asked him if he would be willing to do that and he said yes, so he went with

534
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,259
me to the City Council meeting and it just so happened that that meeting of the City Council

535
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:01,900
where they were scheduled to vote on this issue was the first appearance by Geerhart Casper

536
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,500
who was president of Stanford University and there was a tradition where the president

537
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,820
of the university would go and make, I think, on an annual basis of state of the university

538
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,860
addressed to the City Council because Stanford is adjacent to the City of Palo Alto and they

539
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,780
have a lot of mutual interests and mutual conflicts.

540
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:27,700
So the City is always interested in finding out what Stanford is doing and Stanford is

541
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,180
always interested in finding out what the City is planning so Geerhart Casper was there

542
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:38,140
to spend 20 minutes or so giving his address to the City Council and as Pauling walked

543
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:45,700
in and the chambers were full of people who were waiting to give testimony.

544
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,100
Geerhart Casper recognized Pauling and ran over to him and the two of them exchanged pleasantries.

545
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:57,659
They had never met before and Geerhart Casper who I believe was scheduled before me or

546
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:03,219
before Pauling on the agenda spent quite a lot of his a lot of time talking about what

547
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:06,420
a wonderful person Linus Pauling was.

548
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,940
Talked about it Stanford, there are many Nobel Prize winners, there are so many that they

549
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:16,019
really don't turn heads anymore except for Linus Pauling because Linus Pauling was such

550
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:21,380
an outstanding scholar and such an outstanding piece activist and scientist that when Pauling

551
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:28,259
was there heads did turn and I thought it was quite nice of Casper to talk about Pauling

552
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:34,259
and those glowing terms and Casper is a lawyer so he didn't really have professionally

553
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:39,259
much exposure to Linus Pauling's work in science but nevertheless he recognized that Pauling

554
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,140
was a really eminent scientist and really wanted to pay tribute to him.

555
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:53,700
So that kind of cinched the case for us I think and also there was a fellow in the audience

556
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,620
who stood up and introduced himself by name and said that he felt Pauling's work was

557
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,620
very important and the institute's work was very important and really wanted to encourage

558
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:08,740
the City Council to delay the zoning change and at the end of the meeting when we were

559
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:12,699
waiting I was with Pauling and the underground garage waiting for the card to come around

560
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:17,259
and Pauling mentioned to me that he remembered that fellow who gave public testimony he was

561
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:23,500
a student of his at Caltech and he remembered an incident with him and said that when he

562
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:30,699
was teaching he had the socratic method of teaching where he would pick out people to

563
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:35,419
answer questions because the classes were apparently small enough he knew all the students

564
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:41,860
were new their names so during one of his chemistry lectures he had a question and he

565
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:48,539
picked this fellow out to answer the question and the fellow proceeded to give an answer

566
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:53,740
that was really not the right answer but I guess he felt compelled to say something.

567
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,860
So Pauling just nodded and thanked him for the response and at the end of the class Pauling

568
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:02,900
went up to him and said I'd like to talk with you for a moment and Pauling said you know

569
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,780
it's perfectly okay when you don't know the answer to a question to admit that and

570
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,340
so you don't know the answer actually it's far better than confabulating but I thought

571
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,099
it was it was rather amazing that Pauling remembered that particular incident and this

572
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:23,820
particular fellow who I'm sure he hadn't thought about or seen for decades.

573
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:31,860
Backtracking real quick I was interested to do that here that when Zubi Kamalash that

574
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,300
had a lot of things to do with him.

575
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,820
Yeah Zucar Condolin Hicks were good friends and allies and they'd worked very very closely

576
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,460
together and had actually sacrificed a lot for the institute.

577
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,820
A meal had loaned the institute money gone without salary or decreased salary and Rick Hicks

578
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:56,860
had been also very self-sacrificing trying to help the institute progress over the years.

579
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:04,900
So I think Rick felt when he meals contract was not renewed that he would leave as well

580
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:12,840
and so both of them left but Hicks was then voted to join the Board of Trustees of the

581
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,660
Linus Planets to Science and Medicine which I thought was a terrific collegial and important

582
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:24,539
move for the Board of Trustees to make because Hicks had a lot of insight into fundraising

583
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:29,219
for the institute and just a lot of knowledge and insight about the institute in general

584
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:34,420
and I thought it would be very important for him to be associated in a continued way

585
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
with the institute.

586
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,259
So I thought that was a very good strategic move to ask Rick to become part of the Board.

587
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:43,820
An meal of course had his hands full with trying to administer and get his new institute

588
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,820
institute and molecular medical sciences off the ground and an meal had actually wanted

589
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:55,300
me as well as a number of other people, Jim Fleming and Greg Spicer, Tenebulakos and other

590
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:04,300
people who were doing more molecular biological work that was not really directly allied with

591
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,780
orthomolecular medicine.

592
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,059
For instance Greg Spicer was doing work in molecular evolution.

593
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,580
Jim Fleming was doing work in molecular bases of aging.

594
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:18,300
Tenebulakos was working on histones and DNA repair and a lot of those programs didn't

595
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,300
really fit into the orthomolecular scope of the institute and when the institute was reorganized

596
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:31,300
when Hicks and Zucacondole left the Board decided to refocus the limited resources on orthomolecular

597
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,780
medicine so they wanted to have a much more narrow focus and kind of pair away some of

598
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,300
those programs that were not closely allied with that mission because we just could not

599
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,900
afford to do everything.

600
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,900
And those programs that were being paired away, a meal hoped to collect in this new organization

601
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:54,900
institute and molecular medical sciences and he did to some extent, did that pretty successfully.

602
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,139
So the versions and the research that was the primary reason for the first of your

603
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:00,900
nails departure from the institute?

604
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,900
What?

605
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,900
The versions and the research that was was his primary reason for leaving?

606
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:13,619
Yeah, my understanding was that the Board was very concerned about income and outgo.

607
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,500
So the Board had become increasingly concerned over the late 1980s about the cost of all

608
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:24,219
the programs at the institute and the variable fundraising success.

609
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:29,460
The Sessikawa donation, $500,000 a year for 10 years was coming to an end and couldn't

610
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,859
be renewed due to their charter stipulations.

611
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:40,139
So it was difficult to find money to support some of this work that was not grant funded

612
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:42,299
and a lot of it was not grant funded.

613
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,940
Where's Eurka had a nice grant from the Department of Energy that was funding his work on

614
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,940
allu sequences and non-conserved and conserved DNA and so forth.

615
00:49:51,940 --> 00:50:00,580
But a meals program that I was involved in looking at metastatic cancer, Greg Spicer's work,

616
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,700
some of the other work was really not funded except through unrestricted funds to the

617
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
institute.

618
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:14,539
The Board decided to ask a meal to shrink the institute so that the expenses would be

619
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:20,379
more aligned with the actual revenue instead of continuing to grow the institute or allowing

620
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:25,539
it to continue at what they considered an infeasible size.

621
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:29,739
And I think a meal didn't want to do that.

622
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:36,139
So rather than do something that he didn't want to do, I think he resigned.

623
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,459
And with him went where he kicks.

624
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:44,299
We talked about Cameron's illness in 1991 he died.

625
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:50,419
I'm wondering if he treated himself at all with some of the techniques that he had to

626
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:53,219
advocate for and some of the people in court.

627
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,219
You know.

628
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:55,219
Yeah, that's very interesting.

629
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:59,419
I had asked Cameron about his own habits with vitamin C supplementation much earlier

630
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,420
before he became sick.

631
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:05,019
And he said that he was taking a little vitamin C but not taking megas because he thought

632
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:10,500
that, you know, should he ever get ill, that he wanted to reserve those megas for therapeutic

633
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
value.

634
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:20,500
I think he probably took some vitamin C but as far as I know, he never himself took intravenous

635
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
vitamin C.

636
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:29,159
And again, the differential response to people getting intravenous vitamin C and oral vitamin

637
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,739
C was not well characterized at that time.

638
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:37,380
It was clear that some of the patients getting IV vitamin C did very well.

639
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:43,539
But also if you go back and look at the historical record, Cameron's patient pool, some of those

640
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:49,340
early patients that had complete necrosis of tumors got only oral vitamin C and the

641
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:55,300
tumor necrosis was a consequence temporally of that high dose oral vitamin C.

642
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,140
So I think Cameron and others believe that oral vitamin C had some anti-cancer effects

643
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,140
as well.

644
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,460
Although much later, of course, these transport molecules for vitamin C were discovered

645
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,579
and this was after Cameron and Pauline had both died.

646
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:10,340
These discoveries were made.

647
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:16,980
So now we have a better understanding of the limitations of achieving high concentration

648
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,820
of vitamin C in the blood when you take it only orally.

649
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,699
But in those days, that wasn't well known.

650
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:25,860
So Cameron may have felt, and I never talked to him about this, but he may have felt that

651
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:30,179
since some of his patients did quite well apparently on oral vitamin C that maybe intravenous

652
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:34,179
vitamin C was not important for him.

653
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:43,219
But he also, at the end of his illness, became less willing to see friends and colleagues.

654
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:47,939
So there were many occasions when Zellik Herman and Zellik's girlfriend and I would go to

655
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:53,059
Connie Cameron's house in Redwood City and Ewan was not well enough to see visitors.

656
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:58,219
So we would sit and chat with Connie Cameron and offer her solace and ask her to pass on

657
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:02,819
our good wishes to Ewan, but he clearly was not feeling well enough to see visitors.

658
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:08,339
What was the impact of his death on the Institute?

659
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:16,820
Well Ewan was such a charismatic and wonderful man that it really had a big impact on people

660
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,940
personally.

661
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:29,820
I recall his memorial service in Redwood City, Zellik Herman's girlfriend played bagpipes

662
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,940
and it was just an incredibly emotional event.

663
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,059
People were really grieving about Cameron's death.

664
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:41,460
And of course Pauling was there and Rat was there as well.

665
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,659
Everybody felt terrible about Cameron's death.

666
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:51,860
In 1992, Mattias Rat was appointed vice president for financial affairs at the Institute.

667
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,820
How did this come about?

668
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,820
That's a good question.

669
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,820
That was 1992, you say?

670
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,980
Yeah.

671
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,539
This was after Cameron's death.

672
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:11,139
So Cameron was probably Pauling's closest collaborator in Zellik Herman of course as well.

673
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:18,119
When Rat arrived with these ideas about cardiovascular disease and the proprteen and vitamin C and

674
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:25,619
he and Pauling started working very closely on this collaboration, I think that sort of

675
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:27,619
took center stage in Pauling's life.

676
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:32,539
And although he remained committed to some of the problems that he was working with,

677
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:42,579
was Zellik Herman, I think his bond with Rat was getting stronger and stronger.

678
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:48,380
I think Pauling may have unilaterally made that decision to give that appointment to Rat

679
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,420
because he had no reason not to trust him.

680
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:59,940
Clearly, I think Pauling and Rat perceived perhaps a new focus for research at the Institute

681
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,380
which would be vitamin C and heart disease, especially now that there was this reinvigoration

682
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,700
of this focus on orthomolecular medicine.

683
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:13,460
So I think that perhaps it seemed logical that Rat would be involved there because they

684
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,940
also had set up the heart foundation and other organizations to try to raise money specifically

685
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,820
for these clinical trials.

686
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,099
So how did things start to unravel with him?

687
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:36,500
Well I think Rat did a number of things that upset Pauling and caused some consternation

688
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:43,139
that were kind of, it was kind of a political strategy in the scientific realm which sometimes

689
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,539
can work and sometimes can backfire.

690
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:48,500
And I remember there was one meeting I believe in Texas.

691
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:55,259
I can't remember the specific society but it was cardiovascular disease, researchers

692
00:55:55,259 --> 00:56:01,179
and physicians and Rat had Xerox something and put it on every seat in the auditorium

693
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:04,219
for everybody to read.

694
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:10,539
Rat was also developing these ideas about big pharma trying to suppress or inhibit work

695
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:13,340
on orthomolecular medicine.

696
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:20,539
And I think a lot of people share those opinions to some degree.

697
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:30,180
And Rat just seemed to be using more of a political strategy to advance the research agenda.

698
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,740
And some of those things were done I think Pauling felt and others felt maybe not in an entirely

699
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,620
appropriate manner.

700
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:44,460
I remember seeing one press release that Rat had written and Pauling had written all over

701
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:51,739
it that it was really unwise and uncalled for, had nothing new to announce.

702
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:59,539
And I think Linus Pauling was starting to worry a little bit about the trust that he placed

703
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:02,500
in Rat.

704
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:12,380
So at some point when that fund raising or executive vice president position was, I think

705
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,539
Rath resigned or that position was eliminated.

706
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:22,739
Stephen Maddox became vice president for finance or fund raising or whatever the particular

707
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:23,739
title was.

708
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:29,340
So he sort of succeeded Rick Hicks after an interlude there with Matthias Rath being in that position

709
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,900
for a while.

710
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:41,900
And Linus Pauling Jr. and I became increasingly concerned about Rath and his activities.

711
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,900
We also became aware of the fact that Rath had not signed the patent agreement and it was

712
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:57,579
incumbent upon every employee as an obligation of employment to sign a patent agreement.

713
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:01,219
And the patent agreement was actually quite generous when people joined corporations as

714
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:06,900
employees they typically surrender all their rights to the company.

715
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:12,259
Many people can invent and discover wonderful things for companies and not see a dime.

716
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:17,259
Academic institutions attended a little bit differently and in our organization which

717
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:21,420
was modeled after an academic institution it was fairly generous to inventors.

718
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,380
So the idea was that if you discover something that may be patentable in the course of your

719
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:31,539
employment at the institute you can bring that to the institute's administration and

720
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:36,300
decision we had a patent committee at the time and a decision can be made as to whether

721
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,980
the institute would like to pursue this.

722
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:44,019
File the you know get the initiate the patent application process or if the institute did

723
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:48,019
not want to pursue it then they would surrender it to you and you could pursue it at your own

724
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:50,940
expense and you would have the patent and you could go ahead and license it and if there

725
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,820
was a revenue stream that would be solely yours.

726
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:00,900
So the patent agreement stipulated should the institute proceed to try to gain a patent

727
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:06,820
for this invention or discovery that should it be licensed the revenue would be split

728
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,440
between the inventor and the institute and the following percentages and everybody had

729
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,440
signed that.

730
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,780
Linus Pauling had signed that himself and Rath refused to sign it.

731
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,980
I think initially he said he would like to think about it and I think the choice was

732
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:27,500
given to him well you know you really obligated as an employee to sign this and if you don't

733
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,019
want to sign it then you know perhaps you should think about resigning.

734
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:36,460
So he asked for some time to think about that and said fine and a day or two later he

735
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:42,699
said that he wanted to quit and wanted to resign and he did.

736
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:47,460
What was the source of the litigation that he filed against the institute kind of that

737
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:55,460
well he resigned and I really had no interest or I mean I had my hands full with trying

738
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,019
to solve a lot of the financial and personnel and research problems at the institute and

739
01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:04,420
think about where the institute should go in the future and Linus planks health and all

740
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,900
these other myriad problems that we were facing.

741
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,820
So I really didn't keep up with what Rath was doing because he resigned from the institute

742
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,579
he was gone.

743
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:16,539
I didn't really honestly care about what he was doing.

744
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:23,539
It wasn't until maybe a year or so later that we were served with a lawsuit and he had

745
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:30,279
set up a company called HealthNow Incorporated and this company was suing Linus Pauling

746
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:35,539
and the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine for interference with its business

747
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:43,539
activities and the gist of the suit was that Rath apparently had been trying to get to

748
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:49,500
forge business relationships with supplement companies and he was bringing to them these

749
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,860
ideas about vitamin C and heart disease and lysine and so forth presumably to formulate

750
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:59,860
new products or whatever and according to the suit he had met with discouragement from

751
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:05,340
some of these company representatives because they didn't know who he was and they would

752
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:10,619
point to news stories about Linus Pauling, vitamin C and cardiovascular disease or heart

753
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:16,579
health and in many of those stories Rath's name was omitted.

754
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:21,699
Not because Pauling failed to give him credit because Pauling I think was very fair and

755
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:27,219
a gallotarian about that and would always mention Rath when he talked to journalists or media

756
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:32,739
about these ideas in lipoprotein A and vitamin C and heart disease, atherosclerosis but

757
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:38,699
because Rath was kind of an unknown quantity and really had no reputation to speak of and

758
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:45,779
just inferring this media often would drop his name and the focus would be on Linus Pauling

759
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:51,779
and I think Rath found that very frustrating and discouraging because he perceived that

760
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:57,659
lack of credit interfering with his ability to make these business relationships with

761
01:01:57,659 --> 01:02:02,500
different supplement companies and so he found an attorney and decided to file suit against

762
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:09,500
the institute and that led to actually his complaint was dismissed essentially but we

763
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:18,380
filed a cross complaint because in the course of this litigation he had made a lot of statements

764
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,820
that we felt were injurious to our activities.

765
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:28,820
At the time we were trying to forge a relationship with Elizabeth Arden and Unilever Corporation

766
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:35,559
who were interested in developing a line of cosmetic products that would include things

767
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:40,760
like vitamin C and antioxidants and phytochemicals and they wanted to support some research at

768
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,860
the institute and get involved with the institute in interesting ways and Rath had started

769
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:50,059
to communicate with these people telling them that we were unreliable business partners

770
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:55,300
and so on and so forth and that he owned all these rights and so we felt compelled to

771
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,460
sue him to stop interfering with our business relationships and during the course of this

772
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:08,620
litigation Rath alluded to some agreements that he had executed with Linus Pauling that

773
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:13,019
he claimed gave him all kinds of rights that we weren't aware of.

774
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:17,980
So Linus Pauling Jr. and I were bewildered by this and we went to the documents that

775
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:24,980
Dorothy Monroe pulled out of the file for us and she showed us these agreements that looked

776
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:29,860
had been written by Rath and signed by Pauling and then in some cases witnessed by a third

777
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:36,860
party and they had to do with Rath's rights essentially and we were very surprised by

778
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:47,579
these documents. They didn't seem to be proper and we took them to Linus Pauling and showed

779
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,820
them to him and asked him if he had any memory of these documents or the circumstances

780
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:58,059
under which he signed them and he looked at them very carefully and was confused about

781
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:04,539
them and read them and said well that certainly looks like my name I believe that that's my

782
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:10,539
signature but I don't recall the content of this document at all and now that I read

783
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:17,019
it I would not have signed it. So we tried to reconstruct why Linus Pauling signed these

784
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:24,099
documents and we came to the impression and again it's hard to verify this independently

785
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:28,780
it can't be verified independently but based on statements that Dorothy Monroe and others

786
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:35,780
made we came to the opinion that Rath had gotten Pauling to sign these documents when he

787
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:40,940
was executive vice president and may have gone into Pauling's office with a whole sheath

788
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:46,380
of documents for Pauling to execute and these documents were probably among those papers

789
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:52,780
and Pauling just signed them without reading them carefully and it turned out in the

790
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:58,260
consequence of litigation the documents that Pauling had signed giving Rath lots of

791
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:07,260
rights and ownership were nullified for lack of compensation. So how was all the litigation

792
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:14,619
involved? Well the litigation was resolved you know typically the court really encourages

793
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:19,339
you to come to a settlement and there are settlement conferences set up by the court to

794
01:05:19,339 --> 01:05:25,339
get the parties together to hash out a settlement because the court really doesn't want to get

795
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:29,619
involved in litigation unless it's absolutely necessary so they have retired judges who

796
01:05:29,619 --> 01:05:34,659
mediate these settlement conferences and the retired judge seems to have the strategy

797
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:42,259
of keeping people in a room until they give up weird out and settle and it's a strategy

798
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:47,020
I think that works pretty often so we had a number of settlement conferences and eventually

799
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:53,740
rather than going through a trial Rath sued against us had been dismissed so the only remaining

800
01:05:53,740 --> 01:06:03,020
issue was Rath sued against him across complaint excuse me for libel and judicious info what was

801
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:09,980
it called interference with our business relationships I can't remember the exact terminology so that

802
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:16,099
was what was on the table to settle the suit against health now and Rath so we came to a settlement

803
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:23,340
that we were satisfied with we Rath was supposed to pay us I believe $75,000 we were not to

804
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:32,139
disparage his activities he would not disparage our activities mutual non disparagement and we

805
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:38,820
assigned him some patents that he basically had done the work on so we felt you know would be

806
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:44,140
fine to give them those patents we didn't really expect them to generate any income anyway and that

807
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:51,500
was the the the gist of the settlement by and large and Rath never paid the $75,000

808
01:06:51,500 --> 01:07:02,140
we mentioned a little bit of course of this interview the role that Linus pointed you played and

809
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:08,300
essentially inserting himself and dealing with some of the administrative issues that his father

810
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,620
was either disinterested or unable to do because of his advancing age in the clinic health I'm

811
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:18,140
wondering if you could comment a little bit on sort of last year's arrival at the Institute in the

812
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:24,740
role that he played in those last few years of his father's life yeah well when the the staff

813
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:29,820
became aware of the fact that there were problems or financial problems so this was you know

814
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:34,539
sometime in the very early 1990s and then when Paul had been diagnosed and disclosed his disease

815
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:39,980
publicly there was quite a lot of anxiety I would say because people really weren't sure what

816
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:47,619
was going to happen to them to the research programs to the institute and there was just a lot

817
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:55,500
of unease among the staff and the board I think recognized this and realized that they had to do

818
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:02,059
something specific and concrete and make some very definite steps and kind of clarify all the

819
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:06,980
ambiguity and gossip that was going around and kind of put it into the gossip and really lay

820
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:11,139
things out here's here's where the status is now and here's where we're going to go in the future

821
01:08:11,139 --> 01:08:18,460
and Linus Plain Jr. had been a board member right from the early days at the Institute but I think

822
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:24,659
he recognized that his father was unwilling or unable to resolve some of these issues in a really

823
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:32,019
meaningful way so he decided to assert himself more in the role of the board so he decided

824
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:38,980
or I guess with the board and his father's acknowledgement he became chairman of the board of trustees

825
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:48,860
and Linus Pauling became director of research I think at that time too so because Pauling was

826
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,100
essentially directing a lot of the research at the Institute anyway so he was director of

827
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:57,700
research Linus Plain Jr. I believe became chairman of the board and then at some point in there I

828
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:03,500
moved from becoming executive officer to chief executive officer and because Linus Plain Jr. was

829
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:09,659
chairman of the board and we have lots of problems and I had very little experience in large scale

830
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:15,099
administration I'd been administering a relatively small research group with a little bit of fundraising

831
01:09:15,099 --> 01:09:22,859
activity and a little bit of public relations I frequently gave tours to the two people who

832
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,659
visited the Institute and wanted to learn about our science so I had some skills there I guess

833
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:35,099
or some experience at least and Linus Plain Jr. and I started to work very closely together so I

834
01:09:35,099 --> 01:09:39,979
really I had seen him before but I never had never really worked intensively with him until he

835
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:46,619
sort of took over management for his father in those early days nearly part of the decade there

836
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:57,420
and I found him to be very a very reasonable forceful, thoughtful person and I really appreciated

837
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:05,020
his skill and essentially wisdom in addressing some of these issues that face the Institute he seemed to

838
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:11,260
have a pretty pretty good way of analyzing some of the problems and together we worked up strategies to

839
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:16,300
solve some of the issues that we were facing. Was it all in touch with him the Institute of the

840
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:22,699
Ravon is assumption of this role? I don't think so because I think most people realized that Linus

841
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:29,340
was not going to be an effective administrator of the Institute at that stage so somebody needed to

842
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:36,380
take put their hand on the rudder of the ship and start to exercise some direction and I think

843
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:41,819
people were I mean I can't say what everybody's reaction was about me becoming chief executive

844
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:47,739
officer because that was an unusual move I didn't have an advanced degree although I had been

845
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:52,859
co-directing a relative with small research group and there were other people with seniority

846
01:10:53,659 --> 01:11:00,939
that one could have predicted would have been asked to become chief executive officer. I'm not

847
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:09,340
quite sure why I was asked but I was honestly I was a little flattered and I thought I felt very

848
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:15,099
stimulated by the challenge of becoming chief executive officer learning more about

849
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,740
what problems the Institute faced and how to solve them because I always considered myself a

850
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,700
bit of a problem solver and here was a whole set of what seemed to be very very serious problem so

851
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:31,660
I'm not sure I would have taken the job and you know if I'd known when they asked me to become

852
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:36,460
CEO the magnitude of the problems at the Institute face but I'm glad I did.

853
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,100
What was the biggest challenge in hindsight for you in assuming that role?

854
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,700
Well the biggest problem the biggest immediate problem was funding and it was heartbreaking

855
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:53,500
for me to lay off people that I had worked with and for for a very very long time.

856
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,060
Absolutely heartbreaking I mean I literally had tears in my eyes when I was telling people that

857
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:04,380
there was no longer a job for them at the Institute but it was a fact of life and it was sort of my first

858
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:12,380
first exposure to what it's like to be in charge and make unpopular decisions or decisions that

859
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:18,460
you don't want to make as a person but you're obligated to make because of the role that you're

860
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,340
playing in an organization so it was it was difficult too.

861
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:33,180
A couple more questions for today. One event in the Institute that seemed to come at exactly

862
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:36,380
the right time was the donation to the estate of Carl Spodner.

863
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:42,300
Yes yes. Can you give any background on this? This is something that seems to provide a bit of a

864
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:47,420
lifeline for the Institute and most needed it. That's right and as a matter of fact I remarked to a meal

865
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:53,100
because a meal had already decided at that time that he was leaving. There was kind of a bittersweet

866
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:58,700
news for a meal because on the one hand you know this was the salvation financial salvation for the

867
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:05,340
Institute but other decisions that already been made so it came a little too late in some regard.

868
01:13:07,019 --> 01:13:13,739
Spodner to the best of my understanding had been a donor to the Institute for quite a long time,

869
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:20,939
very small amounts of money and at the time the Institute did not have access to a lot of

870
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:28,300
research capability to investigate donors based on tax filings or real estate holdings or

871
01:13:29,019 --> 01:13:34,300
zip code or anything like that. These days it's very sophisticated kind of donor research that

872
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:42,059
philanthropic organizations or foundations can do to find out really who among their constituents

873
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:48,220
have the ability to make large gifts of one sort or another. Back then we didn't really have that

874
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:53,739
ability so there was no way of targeting people who were giving small donations to the Institute

875
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:58,939
cultivation for instance and the other kinds of fundraising strategies that might be developed to

876
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:04,859
encourage people to give money. So it was a big surprise when we were notified about this estate

877
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:10,380
that had lots of different aspects to it. I believe there was an office building and a home and

878
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:17,899
gold coins and money and just a lot of different financial instruments within this estate

879
01:14:18,699 --> 01:14:24,619
and it really did allow us to pay off some of the debts to trustees who had loaned the Institute

880
01:14:24,619 --> 01:14:32,059
money and to kind of get on an even keel a bit and we also within a couple years

881
01:14:33,339 --> 01:14:40,619
became aware of another big request the Phineas State which also helped us establish enough money

882
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:46,619
so that we could have an endowment that would make the Institute more attractive to a college

883
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:56,140
university to which we might move and it allowed us to bring 1.5 million dollars at least to

884
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:02,220
Oregon State University when we moved up here in 1996 to endow the director's position and at

885
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:07,500
that time there was a match in the state so there was a functional 3 million dollar endowment which

886
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:12,619
was really a good endowment to attract top caliber scientists for this directorship of the Linus

887
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:18,859
Long Institute but getting back to the Phineas State when was this the Phineas? The Phineadonation was

888
01:15:18,859 --> 01:15:28,300
sometime in the early 1990s maybe 93 through 94 or 5 I don't really remember the exact date

889
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:34,300
at that time I was also negotiating contracts with Elizabeth Arden that I expected would produce

890
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:43,020
a very considerable revenue stream for the Institute for a very conceivably quite a long time

891
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:49,340
and that to me looked like it might be the financial salvation for the Institute and allow the

892
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:56,779
Institute to remain as an independent biomedical organization and recruit and attract top caliber

893
01:15:57,579 --> 01:16:03,500
scientists but that was still under negotiation and under development we weren't quite sure

894
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:10,460
where that was going to go I got a phone call from a woman in New Jersey I believe who said that

895
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:17,340
she wanted to know if I was aware of... is there going to be Ms. Katherine Phineas? Kathleen Phineas?

896
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:23,180
I'm not quite sure what her first name was but this woman had been her best friend and was aware

897
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:30,300
of the last will and testament and told me that she herself had been named as the beneficiary

898
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:38,220
in the will and was to receive a condominium and the Institute was to receive most of the financial

899
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:46,140
instruments that were available in the in the estate and then I think there was small donations

900
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:52,699
elsewhere but it was a fairly large amount of money several million dollars and the woman told me

901
01:16:52,779 --> 01:17:02,220
that Phineas had been deteriorating in recent months and a caregiver had come to live with her

902
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:10,859
and this caregiver apparently had persuaded Phineas to alter her will and leave everything to him

903
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:17,179
and the woman who called me thought that this was really unethical and unjust and that this person

904
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:24,539
exploited a deteriorating woman to his own financial gain and it's her scene that way to me I mean

905
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,579
I didn't know what the facts of the case were but I hired a firm in New Jersey to look into it

906
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,900
and it resulted in a nice settlement for the Institute where we got

907
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:43,100
a belief several million dollars the caretaker ended up with several hundred thousand dollars

908
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:46,620
and the woman who brought this to our attention ended up with her condominium

909
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:51,740
what happened to the Elizabeth Arden relationship?

910
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:57,180
The Elizabeth Arden relationship was quite promising I was really excited by that because

911
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:02,140
there was a research element to it they were quite interested in in funding research that would

912
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:09,660
find out if vitamin C and other micronutrients or phytochemicals could protect skin cells,

913
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:16,779
caretinocytes from damage by sun exposure because they were starting to develop cosmetic

914
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:22,139
topical cosmetic products that included these micronutrients and they also had some

915
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:27,579
preliminary data from their own labs that suggested that topical application of vitamin C and

916
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:34,300
other substances improve the appearance of the skin and I think from a marketing standpoint they

917
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:40,140
were excited about getting involved with the Institute because as the director of research told me

918
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,460
their facility was in Trumbull, Connecticut he's the one who really

919
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:50,220
got in contact with us and asked us if we were interested in working with them in this regard

920
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:55,020
he said you know he started thinking about vitamin C well who who really knows the most about

921
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,579
vitamin C and as well it's Linus Pong I should contact the Linus Pong Institute and he did

922
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:06,539
and we decided because the prospect of revenue was so great or the prospect of a lot of

923
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:10,699
revenue was so great that it wasn't something that we should just take lightly or dismiss

924
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:17,100
so we spent a lot of time thinking about this and analyzing it and we were some of the trustees

925
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:25,819
were concerned about the commercial exploitation of the name Linus Pong and they thought you know

926
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:31,659
perhaps if the product bombs and were associated with it that maybe it will tarnish our reputation

927
01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:37,179
but we worked out an agreement where we had review of all the marketing literature that

928
01:19:37,179 --> 01:19:41,899
Arden and Unilever would produce and they could make certain factual statements about what they

929
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:47,659
were doing at the institute supporting a research project and so forth and that we were not engaged

930
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:53,340
in researching development with Arden looking to formulate new products with Arden that wasn't

931
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:58,940
something that was part of this arrangement or relationship and then we agreed to produce a

932
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:05,500
joint newsletter that would be translated into many different languages and available at

933
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:12,619
point of sale in high end departments towards around the world and we did that one newsletter

934
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:20,060
which featured an interview with Linus Pong Lester Pacta also had an article in that and some

935
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:27,900
information about the institute because I saw this as a way of expanding our base of constituents

936
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:36,620
because if we could introduce the institute and its activities to younger people or middle-aged

937
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:41,740
people that shop at these high end department stores presumably they have high income that they

938
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:47,260
might get interested in supporting the institute's research and may at some point you know in the

939
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:54,780
distant future decide to give us bequest as well if they thought the work we were doing was good

940
01:20:55,659 --> 01:21:01,900
so I thought this was a good way to expand the institute's influence get more

941
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:08,539
public education about what we were doing and generate revenue for the institute and in addition

942
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:14,940
to that exposure there was also a financial element where we would gain financially from

943
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:22,859
the sale of some of their products and this looked to be remarkably large magnitude of money

944
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:29,339
for us really staggering amount of money possibly and everything was great I went to a Humberg

945
01:21:29,339 --> 01:21:33,819
Germany and to New York City and Toronto and participated in press conferences the marketing

946
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:40,379
materials were all developed the product line was about to be launched and the president of

947
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:47,659
Elizabeth Arden Bob Phillips at the time left Arden to take a job with Unilever in London which

948
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:53,819
is the parent company of Elizabeth Arden and they hired a new president from Chicago and this new

949
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:59,100
president came in and proceeded to turn the company upside down suspended a lot of the research

950
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:05,100
contracts except for ours suspended a lot of the marketing efforts for new products and things

951
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:12,780
so unfortunately although everything everybody had expectations for great success because of this

952
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:18,060
management change at Arden it really interfered with the the rollout of all these products and

953
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:24,620
marketing strategies and everything else and she was she left the company after a year and it

954
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:31,980
took them a couple of years after that to fully recover so needless to say our high hopes were

955
01:22:32,059 --> 01:22:38,859
somewhat dashed there because of management issues at Elizabeth Arden and they never followed up on it

956
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:45,259
in the years afterwards they may have you know I don't really follow the cosmetics industry so I

957
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:49,899
don't know what they did subsequently but the relationship with the institute eventually came to an

958
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:55,500
end they continued to provide money you know because we had a contract we had a contract with

959
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:04,060
Elizabeth Arden and we had a sub license from LC Progyny to use the name Linus Pauling and

960
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:08,380
so we could use that name in our association our contractual association with Elizabeth Arden

961
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:13,340
and they were funding a research project as I mentioned that was transferred to

962
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:20,939
LPI at Oregon State so the funding continued for some time and then eventually that project

963
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:26,139
funding ran out and then that was the end of the relationship but they also underwrote

964
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:34,779
our newsletter and they provided I was talking to John McCook who was the vice president for

965
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:43,099
research at Arden and after Pauling's death I brought up with him the prospect of doing a very

966
01:23:43,099 --> 01:23:47,739
nice commemorative issue of the newsletter that would pay tribute specifically to Linus Pauling

967
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:52,859
and he thought that was a terrific idea and we didn't have the money to produce anything really

968
01:23:52,859 --> 01:24:00,460
nice ourselves high volume so Arden very graciously underwrote the commemorative booklet that we

969
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:09,500
produced in lieu of a fall newsletter in 1994 after Linus Pauling died. That's the blue one that we have now.

970
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:18,539
So the last question for today is August of 94 Linus Pauling dies. How would you characterize

971
01:24:18,539 --> 01:24:24,380
this date at the Institute of Point? Well it was a terrible day I mean it was a day that we knew

972
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:31,020
was inevitable but you never want to get that news even when you know you should be expecting it.

973
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:37,899
It was a summer day a beautiful day in Palo Alto. Pauling had been at his ranch in Big Sur

974
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:43,739
and Celacermin and I and some other people had been down to see him. There was a deposition actually

975
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:47,739
of Pauling I believe earlier that summer by our attorneys that we went down for

976
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:55,739
but I didn't have any direct knowledge of his deterioration or health status. I knew that he wasn't

977
01:24:56,059 --> 01:25:00,299
doing really well but I didn't really have any firsthand knowledge of what he was doing there.

978
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:09,100
So we had worked up in obituary based on information available to us from his biography and from

979
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,380
Paradowski's work and probably from materials that were available to us from special collections.

980
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:20,380
So we had an obituary ready to go and of course this was as I said before the internet so the

981
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:27,260
obituary was to be faxed upon notification of Pauling's death. So it had been a typically difficult

982
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:32,380
day at the institute for me. It was always challenging in those days with litigation and financial

983
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:38,699
problems and thinking about the future disposition of the institute and so forth. And I remember going

984
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:46,140
home that day in August and I had a couple of beers before dinner and I got a call from Linus

985
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:52,539
Pond Jr. Before I had a chance to eat and Linus Pauling Jr. told me that his father had just died

986
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:59,340
and it really hit me hard because I was kind of surprised at my own emotional reaction because

987
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:05,659
I really loved Linus Pauling. He was just an amazing person. So immediately I got back in my car.

988
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:11,979
I went back to the institute and I started faxing these obituraries which I had a stack of obituraries

989
01:26:11,979 --> 01:26:21,180
with media contact numbers. So they went to CBS, New York Times, NBC, excuse me, CNN, whatever

990
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:27,180
the media contacts we had. I'd sent them out. San Francisco Chronicles, San Jose Mercury,

991
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:34,619
there were probably 15 or 20 of these to be faxed out. So no sooner had I faxed the third out

992
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:39,740
and the phones started ringing. And in those days we had an old-fashioned phone system where you

993
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:46,380
could see a number of little pegs that would light up for an incoming line and I think that

994
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:51,579
there were as many as six incoming lines. So you could look at a single phone and see six of

995
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:58,220
these clear pegs and a peg would be lit depending upon what the incoming number was.

996
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:05,739
And at first, you know, through the third fax there was one of these little pegs that lit up.

997
01:27:05,739 --> 01:27:11,500
So I answered it while I was continuing to fax and it was newsweek or something and they wanted

998
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:18,460
some pithy quotes about the life of Linus Pauling and it wasn't difficult for me but it really

999
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:25,899
took some effort to hold myself together to give them cogent statements about Linus Pauling

1000
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:33,020
because I was feeling really sad and I was manically trying to fax all these obituraries out.

1001
01:27:33,739 --> 01:27:39,260
And before long, every light was lit and blinking. It was the New York Times, it was CBS,

1002
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:45,180
it was everybody under the sun, one in statements. So I spent the better part of that early evening

1003
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:53,100
there responding to all these phone calls for more information and then the next day of course

1004
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:57,980
everybody at the institute knew that Linus Pauling had died and there was a lot of grief

1005
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:01,820
people were crying and it was a really difficult time for everybody.

1006
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:06,779
In terms of the footing of the institute itself though at that point,

1007
01:28:07,819 --> 01:28:12,859
where how do you characterize it? I mean the name sake of the institute is just died and

1008
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:17,019
what is what the outlook for the organization at that point?

1009
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:25,179
Yeah, we had of course in the Board of Trustees meetings which we had very regularly by the way

1010
01:28:26,139 --> 01:28:30,619
and then we had reports that went out to the board every month because there were so many

1011
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:36,380
problems and we wanted everything to be done as perfectly as possible. So I would write a report

1012
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:42,619
to the Board of Trustees every month and send it off to all of them by fax and that would cover all

1013
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:47,500
the personnel issues, financial issues. I would have the accountant give us a status of our bank

1014
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:52,939
accounts, investments and so forth so that everybody knew all the time exactly where we were.

1015
01:28:53,259 --> 01:29:04,460
And of course we took very seriously the problem of leaving the building in Palo Alto and Linus Pauling

1016
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:11,179
had expressed the desire. I think his first priority was for the institute to remain independent

1017
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:19,259
because I thought I think he felt that we could probably be unsuathed by mainstream medicine

1018
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:22,539
or mainstream science if we retained independence. We could be more

1019
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:29,820
iconic plastic and more of a maverick organization but absent that he completely supported the idea

1020
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:36,619
of integrating into an appropriate university with academic activities that would resonate with

1021
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:42,860
the institute's mission. So who was supportive of that but he died before the discussions with

1022
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:48,859
Oregon State University had really matured. We had lots of people coming to the institute

1023
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:55,179
presenting different options to us ideas about what they would do in the institute, should we

1024
01:29:55,179 --> 01:30:01,739
transfer funds to them and the name and so on and so forth. There was a one fellow who was a

1025
01:30:01,739 --> 01:30:07,339
relocation specialist who had contacted me who had a lot of contacts with the universities around

1026
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:15,980
the country and thanks to his good graces we initiated discussions with university administrators

1027
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:21,819
in Wisconsin and Boston University in Oklahoma and a lot of different places to find out if there

1028
01:30:21,819 --> 01:30:29,819
was any interest in the Linus Pauling Institute. So all those conversations and to be honest with you

1029
01:30:29,819 --> 01:30:34,060
so many things were happening in that short period of time I can't really place everything chronologically

1030
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:41,100
Pauling was certainly aware of the desire that the board had to keep the institute going as a

1031
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:45,580
working tribute to his ideas in orthomolecular medicine. And there were different

1032
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:51,820
options being discussed. One for instance was I think this was brought up by one of our trustees

1033
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:57,500
maybe what we should do is just close the institute down, liquidate everything and take that money

1034
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:03,740
and establish a chair in Linus Pauling's name at Caltech or Stanford or someplace like that.

1035
01:31:03,819 --> 01:31:09,420
That would be most meaningful to Linus Pauling. So those there were lots of different possibilities

1036
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,859
that were that were pretty seriously discussed at those days.

1037
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:18,219
But financially you had a couple pretty big gifts that came and then basically gave you a

1038
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:22,939
bit of water for a little while. That's right and that really improved the probability of

1039
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:31,099
securing the interest of an academic institution too because one problem that we confronted with

1040
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:36,380
lots of universities was that they just didn't have a lot of vacant space. Vacant space doesn't

1041
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:41,900
exist in the university environment. I mean it's subsumed by departments or units right away.

1042
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:49,100
So there wasn't a lot of existing space in any of the universities that we talked with where we

1043
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:55,900
could just walk right in and make ourselves at home. And people have different impressions of the

1044
01:31:56,299 --> 01:32:06,299
of the reputation of the institute. So there are always people that believe that Pauling was

1045
01:32:06,299 --> 01:32:11,019
flaky with the vitamin C and orthomolecular medicine and there were probably institutions that

1046
01:32:11,019 --> 01:32:19,339
shared that attitude as well. So we recognized that any institution who was looking to

1047
01:32:21,339 --> 01:32:25,420
gain the Linus Pauling Institute would also be gaining perhaps a little bit of a risk as well.

1048
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:31,899
And the litigation had been covered in the papers so it was a difficult time. There was no question

1049
01:32:31,899 --> 01:32:39,899
that it wasn't a perfect organization with a stellar medical scientific record that was coming in

1050
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:47,819
with no stains. There were some problems, image problems perhaps. So we were concerned that

1051
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:54,220
that would be make it very difficult for people to be to warmly receive the institute.

1052
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:59,100
So the money really improved the probability because when you can bring money while suddenly

1053
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,820
university administrators can see much more potential if you're bringing some money with you.
